5|$|Following Virginia Tech's kickoff and a touchback, Florida State's offense {{started work}} at its 20-yard line. Tech {{committed}} a five-yard penalty, {{and as the}} final seconds of the quarter ticked off, Florida State <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> middle for five yards and a first down. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, the score was 147, Florida State leading.|$|E
5|$|Daley {{received}} criticism when family, personal friends, {{and political}} allies seemed to disproportionately benefit from city contracting. He {{took office in}} a city with regular annual budget surpluses and left the city with massive structural deficits. His budgets <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> largest deficits in Chicago history. Prior to serving as mayor, Daley served in the Illinois Senate and then as the Cook County State's Attorney. Police use of force was an issue in Daley's tenures as state's attorney and mayor.|$|E
5|$|In October 1834 Richard Weobley, the Clerk of Works, {{received}} {{instructions from}} Treasury officials {{to clear the}} old tally sticks while parliament was adjourned. He decided against giving the sticks away to parliamentary staff to use as firewood, and instead opted to burn them in the two heating furnaces of the House of Lords, directly below the peers' chambers. The furnaces had been designed to burn coal—which gives off a high heat with little flame—and not wood, which burns with a high flame. The flues of the furnaces <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> walls of the basement {{in which they were}} housed, under the floors of the Lords' chamber, then up through the walls and out through the chimneys.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} Air Force {{play of the}} second half, quarterback Chance Harridge <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of the field}} for a 21-yard gain. The Falcons {{followed}} that first-down play with a series of rushes that resulted in another first down, this time in Virginia Tech territory. But as the Hokies had done before them, the Falcons faltered inside opposition territory. Instead of punting the ball, however, Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry kept his offense on the field to attempt to gain the needed twoyards on fourth down. The attempt was unsuccessful, and Tech's offense returned to the field with 7:40 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
5|$|On the Tar Heels' {{first play}} of the game, running back Jonathan Linton <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> middle for a three-yard gain. After the gain, Carolina quarterback Chris Keldorf {{completed}} a 31-yard pass to tight end Alge Crumpler for a first down at the Virginia Tech 47-yard line. Now inside Virginia Tech territory, Linton ran for a five-yard gain, which {{was followed by a}} pass from Keldorf to Linton, who gained 26 yards on the play. Following the catch, North Carolina had a first down at the Virginia Tech 16-yard line. Linton left the field limping slightly, and backup running Mike Geter replaced him, then ran for four yards up the middle. Geter was stopped for no gain on the next play, and a third down pass by Keldorf fell incomplete. North Carolina kicker Josh McGee entered the game to attempt a 29-yard field goal, which was good. With 9:15 remaining in the quarter, North Carolina took a 30 lead.|$|E

5|$|The Florida State Seminoles are {{coached by}} Bobby Bowden, father of Tommy Bowden. Their 2001 matchup marked {{only the second}} time that a father and son had faced each other as {{opposing}} head football coaches. The only other meeting had been the previous year, when Tommy lost by three points to his father. In the 2001 meeting, No. 4 Florida State dominated No. 10 Clemson {{from the start of the}} game. In an effort to impress BCS voters, Florida State <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> score and the game ended with the Seminoles on top, 527. The Seminoles' win gave them the ACC football championship and dropped Clemson to a No. 16 ranking. With its spot as the No. 2 ACC team assured, Clemson accepted a bid to the Gator Bowl on November 14, prior to its annual in-state rivalry game against South Carolina. In that game, South Carolina took a one-point lead with 59 seconds remaining, but Clemson drove the length of the field and kicked a field goal as time expired, giving the Tigers a 1614 win to end the regular season.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the 23-yard line, and Clemson went three and out after Simmons threw three incomplete passes. The Tigers' punt {{was returned}} to the Tech 30-yard line, and the Hokies began another possession. Vick was again replaced by Meyer at the quarterback position, and running back Dwayne Ward <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{middle of the field}} for a short gain. Third-string running back Keith Burnell gained more yardage with a run up the middle, then Ward picked up a first down with a run up {{the left side of the}} field. During the play, Tech committed a 10-yard penalty, but the resulting yardage was still enough for a first down. Tech proceeded to run out the remaining seconds on the clock, and the Virginia Tech Hokies earned a 4120 victory.|$|E
5|$|The road opener was {{the first}} game ever played in the new home stadium of the UCF Knights. McCoy's 47 passing {{attempts}} tied a Texas single-game record. His 32 completions set a new school record, besting the 30 completed by Vince Young during the 2006 Rose Bowl and by Major Applewhite during two 1999 games. The final non-conference game was against Rice, and McCoy completed 20 of his 29 passing attempts, accumulating 333 yards through the air. For {{the first time in}} the season, he did not throw an interception. McCoy and most of the Longhorn starting players were replaced by backups after the first drive of the second half. True freshman quarterback John Chiles made his first college appearance in the first quarter. He came onto the field beside McCoy and then McCoy trotted out to a slot receiver position. Chiles never looked to pass; he <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> middle for no gain. He came out of the game after that play and came back in the third quarter as McCoy's replacement. On that drive, Chiles line up in the zone-read offense and led the Longhorns 80 yards to a touchdown, carrying the ball four times for 49 yards. Chiles' strong performance immediately led to media speculation as to how much playing time he will take from McCoy.|$|E

25|$|In 1872 a Congregational {{church was}} built about 30 chains nearer Raglan, on land {{originally}} {{taken up by}} W. Cogswell. A section of about 3 acres was acquired, running from {{the road to the}} top of the hill. It was built by Jim Pearce and Joseph Pretty. A scrub fire about 1904 quickly <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill, and completely demolished the building. A 20 feet high stone cairn was built here in 1971.|$|E
25|$|The palace {{was mainly}} {{designed}} for comfort. On {{the ground floor}} of the palace was the kitchen with a large fireplace and oven. The first floor has the banqueting hall, and above on the second hall had bedrooms for the family. The original staircase leading up to the first floor was a wooden one which <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> outside of the building; however, due to the wet climate a stone staircase was later added inside the palace.|$|E
25|$|The Singsaker Line {{branched}} as {{a double}} track {{line from the}} Elgeseter Line at Student Society in Trondheim (Studentersamfundet). There it branched off Elgeseter gate immediately after the Elgeseter Bridge and <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill along Klostergata. The line continues with the street name change to Christian Fredriks gate with the stop Vollabakken. It continues under the College Bridge onto Eidsvolls gate, passing the Norwegian Institute of Technology. After passing Jonsvannsveien the line had a stop named for said road outside R. Kjeldbergs Kolonial, serving the neighborhood of Singsaker.|$|E

25|$|Leith's men pushed {{along the}} walls toward the lesser breach where they {{assisted}} the Portuguese in breaking through. Still undefeated, Rey led his men in a house-to-house battle that finally ended {{when he and his}} remaining 1,300 troops took refuge in the La Mota Castle. Meanwhile, the Allied troops went berserk and sacked the city for three days in which the place was virtually destroyed. Ensconced in his hilltop castle, Rey held out against a 60-gun bombardment until 8 September when he finally <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> white flag. Before being forced to surrender the survivors of his garrison, his soldiers inflicted over 5,000 casualties on their enemies, including Leith who was wounded.|$|E
25|$|Mack later {{claimed that}} d'Aspré {{failed to report}} his contact with the French, though this may be an attempt at self-justification. Ney interrogated his {{prisoner}} d'Aspré and reported to Napoleon that the Austrian army was falling back to Biberach an der Riß. This was not true, {{but it is not}} clear whether d'Aspré deliberately misled his captor or if he was only guessing what Mack's intentions were. The campaign ended in disaster for Austria when Mack capitulated with 25,000 troops at Ulm on 20 October, Werneck surrendered his remaining 6,000 men on 18 October, and the 4,600-strong garrison of Memmingen also <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> white flag. A total of almost 50,000 Austrians became prisoners in the fighting.|$|E
25|$|By Lee's estimation, {{the fort}} {{could not be}} reduced by {{bombardment}} or direct assault, only by starvation. As long as supplies could be built up, they would be. The last Confederate supply ship to Fort Pulaski was the small workhorse steamboat Ida. On February 13, {{it was on a}} routine run to the fort down the North Channel. The new battery of Federal heavy guns on the north bank opened up for the first time. The old side-wheeler ran for Pulaski and the battery got off nine shots before the guns recoiled off their platforms. Union troops went back to work modifying platform construction and resetting the cannon. Two days later Ida <b>ran</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> South Channel under the extinguished lighthouse and returned to Savannah through Tybee Creek.|$|E
