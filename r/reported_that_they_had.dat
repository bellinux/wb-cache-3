5|$|Amid {{reports of}} looting, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} safety of the antiquities of the famous Egyptian Museum, near the epicenter of the Cairo protests. Egyptian state television announced in the evening that army commandos had secured the museum. Protesters joined soldiers in protecting the museum, situated beside the burning ruling party headquarters. Looters managed to enter during the night from the roof to damage a number of small artifacts, and it was initially <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> ripped the heads off two mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E
5|$|Enrico Fermi {{and a team}} of {{scientists}} at the University of Rome <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> discovered element 94 in 1934. Fermi called the element hesperium and mentioned it in his Nobel Lecture in 1938. The sample was actually a mixture of barium, krypton, and other elements, but this was not known at the time. Nuclear fission was discovered in Germany in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. The mechanism of fission was then theoretically explained by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch.|$|E

5|$|Following the Manchester United board's {{search for}} new investors, the Glazers {{purchased}} their first tranche of Manchester United shares on 2 March 2003, spending around £9million on a 2.9% stake, which they purchased through a holding company called Red Football. On 26 September 2003, it was <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> increased their share to 3.17%, taking their shareholding above the 3% threshold that required them to inform the club's management. There had already been considerable speculation {{about the possibility of}} a takeover of the club, either by the Glazers or by one of several other interested parties. By 20 October, they had increased their shareholding to 8.93%, and on 29 November it was reported that they owned around 15% of the club and had met David Gill, its chief executive, to discuss their intentions. On 12 February 2004, the Glazers increased their stake in the club to 16.31% and the following day's Financial Times <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> instructed Commerzbank to explore a takeover bid. The club's share price increased by 5% that day, valuing the club at a total of £741million. The Glazers increased their shareholding to over 19% the following June, although they were still not the largest shareholders. Their shareholding continued to increase, nearing 30% by October 2004. Upon reaching 30%, they would have to launch a formal takeover bid.|$|E
5|$|The project {{continued}} {{to run into}} difficulties with malfunctions, financial problems and threats of work stoppages. New letters patent were issued on 12 August 1779 that doubled the rates and extended the term to ninety-nine years. The concessionary could now also expropriate land for shops, warehouses and housing for employees. The work was complete in May 1780 and was finally opened for navigation from Givors to Rive-de-Gier the following December. The concessionaries <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> spent six million francs, but the canal probably cost much more.|$|E
5|$|Along with Company F, {{which had}} {{returned}} to the base camp, Carlson proceeded to the area where Company C was engaged, arriving at 16:30. Carlson ordered Company F to attack the Japanese positions facing Company C at 17:15. In the meantime, the Japanese troops departed the area, which Company F soon confirmed. Leaving Company F at the scene, Carlson returned to Binu with Company C, arriving at 22:00. Company E arrived at Binu about the same time and <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> caught a Japanese company crossing a river in the open and killed many of them before withdrawing. Carlson then took Company B and returned to the area that Company F was guarding, arriving at daybreak on 12 November. The Marines had suffered 10 killed in the day's actions and estimated that they had killed 120Japanese soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{efforts were}} {{launched}} from St John's {{in the hope}} of finding more survivors. An English schooner, John Clements, spent a week searching, before returning with Arctics flagstaff but no personnel. The New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company, owners of the steamer Victoria, offered their vessel to the US consul for a fee of $500 a day, an action which led to considerable local press criticism. By contrast, the Bishop of Newfoundland, the Right Revd Edward Feild, provided his private yacht Hawk free of charge. Eventually Victoria agreed to assist without payment, although an unnamed correspondent of the Public Ledger doubted whether the ship made more than a perfunctory search. None of the ships other than John Clements found any definite traces of Arctic. Some <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> sighted debris, but were not able to identify or recover it.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, the WSB's {{spokesman}} {{stated that}} the remaining six members of the patrol, who had now been held for over a fortnight, would only be released after a new government was formed in Sierra Leone, leading negotiators {{to conclude that the}} increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt to conclude the crisis. At around the same time, teams that had been observing the West Side Boys' base for four days <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> seen no sign of the captive soldiers in that time. There were also concerns that an assault would become more dangerous if the West Side Boys moved the hostages. The combination of these factors led COBRA to order an extraction mission.|$|E
5|$|Spence and Stilwell were arraigned on {{the robbery}} charges before Justice Wells Spicer, who set their bail at $7,000 each. They were {{released}} after paying their bail, but Spence and Stilwell were rearrested by Virgil for the Bisbee robbery a month later, on October 13, {{on the new}} federal charge of interfering with a mail carrier. The newspapers, however, <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been arrested for a different stage robbery that occurred (October 8) near Contention City. Occurring {{less than two weeks}} before the O.K. Corral shootout, this final incident may have been misunderstood by the McLaurys. While Wyatt and Virgil were still out of town for the Spence and Stilwell hearing, Frank McLaury confronted Morgan Earp, telling him that the McLaurys would kill the Earps if they tried to arrest Spence, Stilwell, or the McLaurys again.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This study's {{purpose was}} to examine children's attitudes toward dental {{appearance}} and compare these with attitudes toward general health, body shape, grades in school, friends, money, and sports. The study also explored whether subjects <b>reporting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> attractive teeth believed themselves to have higher grades in school, more friends, a slim body shape, and better health than subjects <b>reporting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> unattractive teeth. Methods: A sample of 216 9 - to 13 -year-old Dutch children participated. The methods of paired comparisons and direct ranking were used to investigate children's judgments {{about the importance of}} dental appearance. The subjects were also asked to indicate how strongly <b>they</b> believed <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> high grades in school, a lot of friends, money, success in sports, attractive teeth, a slim body shape, and good health. Results: High grades in school, a slim body shape, good health, a lot of friends, and more money were preferred to attractive teeth. Children <b>reporting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> attractive teeth believed themselves to have higher grades in school, a slimmer body shape, more friends, more money, and better health than children <b>reporting</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> unattractive teeth. Conclusions: Although attractive teeth are highly valued in general, children give priority to other issues in their lives...|$|R

5|$|Acadians {{continued}} {{to survive in}} the region, overcoming the results of the raids. Scott sailed back to the region to search for Beausoleil and to weaken the Acadians before the winter. He arrived in Moncton near midnight on 12 November, but the tide of the Petitcodiac River prevented him from sending more than twelve men. They came back the next morning with 16 prisoners. Scott was told that the area was virtually defenceless, so he sent three parties to La Chapelle (now Bore Park in Moncton), Silvabro (now Lewisville), and Jagersome (now Dieppe). Scott recorded no deaths or prisoners, but all buildings in sight were burned, and cattle were brought back onto the vessel. Additional raids by Scott between 14 and 17 November captured a dozen Acadian prisoners, burned settlements, and uncovered Beausoleil's own schooner. The crew sent an Acadian prisoner on the 17th to request the surrender of the remaining residents, but when he returned, he <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> all begun to flee to Cocagne, Shediac, and the settlements around the Miramichi River. This prompted Scott to return to Fort Frederick in Saint John.|$|E
5|$|On September25, the {{government}} of Spain approved $1.07million in food assistance for Cuba. On September29, {{the government}} of Japan sent water equipment, soap, towels, and emergency health kits worth $119,200 to the affected areas in Cuba. By February 1999, the Japanese Government had provided Cuba with nearly $1million in disaster funds. An emergency cash grant of $50,000 was also given to Cuba by the United Nations. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized about 8,700 volunteers to assist victims of the storm in the 900 shelters set up throughout the island. Plastic sheeting was to be distributed {{for about a week}} for residents to patch holes in the roof of their homes. The National Council of Churches sent relief goods valued at $70,000 to the Cuban Government on October9. By February 1999, the Cuban Red Cross distributed over 30,000 sheets of roofing to nearly 5,500 people in three provinces. Several months after the storm, the Cuban Government <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> allocated about $38million in funds for Hurricane Georges.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{observers}} {{present for}} the exercise <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been impressed {{with the performance of}} the glider-borne elements of the division. However, several noted that the training of the aircraft pilots for night formation flying and navigation was far from satisfactory. A recommendation was made that night that glider landings should be considered only when an emergency existed, and that otherwise gliders should take off during the night and land during daylight to avoid the wide dispersal of airborne troops and a decrease in efficiency. After these exercises had ended, the division continued to train, but encountered further delays. These were caused when 1,652 men were removed from the division to provide reinforcements for U.S. Airborne units in the European Theater; this drastically reduced the strength of the division and forced it to extend its training period for a further four months. After completing its training in January the division was preparing to transfer to the Pacific Theatre in early 1945. However, the rapid advances made by German forces during the Battle of the Bulge led to the division being transferred to the European Theatre of Operations to reinforce Allied divisions already in combat.|$|E

5|$|The first {{announcement}} {{of the discovery of}} element 102 was announced by physicists at the Nobel Institute in Sweden in 1957. The team <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> bombarded a curium target with carbon-13 ions for twenty-five hours in half-hour intervals. Between bombardments, ion-exchange chemistry was performed on the target. Twelve out of the fifty bombardments contained samples emitting (8.5±0.1)MeV alpha particles, which were in drops which eluted earlier than fermium (atomic number Z=100) and californium (Z=98). The half-life reported was 10minutes and was assigned to either 251102 or 253102, although the possibility that the alpha particles observed were from a presumably short-lived mendelevium (Z=101) isotope created from the electron capture of element 102 was not excluded. The team proposed the name nobelium (No) for the new element, which was immediately approved by IUPAC, a decision which the Dubna group characterized in 1968 as being hasty. The following year, scientists at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory repeated the experiment but were unable to find any 8.5MeV events which were not background effects.|$|E
5|$|Doubtful {{of their}} ability to capture the redoubt alone, at 13:15 Meldrum asked for reinforcements; he was {{informed}} there were no more available. The Canterbury Mounted Rifles, advanced into a gap between the Wellingtons and the 5th Mounted Brigade, which eased the pressure. By 15:00 the superior Turkish numbers and their strong defences, forced Meldrum to commit his reserve, the 2nd Squadron and a section of the Machine-Gun Squadron. At the same time, the horses were moved further to the rear so that they would be out of artillery range. At 15:15 the regiment's right was counter-attacked by three or four hundred Turkish troops. Fifteen minutes later Meldrum again asked for reinforcements; he was again refused. Supported by their artillery, the regiment held out until 17:00, when the Turks retired, having suffered heavy losses. An hour later the regiment was ordered to withdraw at nightfall. The 2nd Squadron <b>reported</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> gained a position which allowed them to assault the redoubt. Meldrum, aware that the redoubt would have to be abandoned even if they were successful, refused to allow the assault. At 18:30 the Royal Horse Artillery withdrew. Then, confusingly, the regiment was ordered to remain where they were, until the yeomanry to their left had moved back. So it was not until 20:15 that the regiment left the front line. At 01:00 20 April the regiment reached the night camp at El Jemme. Their casualties during the battle amounted to one dead and twenty-three wounded. The same night, this second attempt to capture Gaza was called off.|$|E
