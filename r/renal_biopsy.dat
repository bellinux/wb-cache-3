Primary glomerular disease accounted for two-thirds of the glomerular diseases, which in turn constituted 49 % of all <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies.</b> The most common histological lesion was membranoproliferative disease (28 %). Membranous GN was the second most common lesion (19 %), followed by minimal change disease (16 %) and focal segmental GN (11 %). Secondary glomerular disease comprised 30 % of glomerular diseases (21 % of all the <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies),</b> with lupus nephritis forming the most common lesion (34 %) followed by amyloidosis (22 %), diabetic nephropathy (10 %), Wagener′s granulomatosus and post-infectious GN (9 % each).

The kidney tissue is then examined under a microscope, allowing direct visualization of the changes occurring within the kidney. Additionally, the pathology may also stage a problem affecting the kidney, allowing some degree of prognostication.

BackgroundWe {{have previously}} reported that both αβ and γδ T cells {{are involved in}} the progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN) to renal failure. To determine whether the T-cells seen in the interstitium represent a generalized inflammatory response or whether they are proliferating oligoclonally in response to a particular antigen, we analyzed the TCR Vβ gene usage by T cells infiltrating <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> from patients with IgAN. MethodsFourteen IgAN patients were divided by clinical criteria into stable and progressive groups (7 in each group). Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and cloning were used to characterize the expression of TCR Vβ families in <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> and in peripheral blood lymphocytes. ResultsTCR Vβ 8 was significantly and preferentially expressed in most IgAN kidney biopsies compared with peripheral blood lymphocytes from both IgAN patients and healthy controls (P < 0. 001). TCR Vβ 8 expression was more marked in progressive biopsies than in stable biopsies (P < 0. 05). Spectratyping of Vβ 8 RT-PCR products from T cells infiltrating the kidney showed an intense spectratype band at the shortest range of amplified CDR 3 s in the <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> of four patients. Analysis of nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of Vβ 8 PCR products derived from intense spectratype bands from these <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> revealed a high concordance across the CDR 3 region. A conserved amino acid (leucine) at the first position of the nongermline-encoded nucleotides and diversity (ND) junction of Vβ 8 was found at a frequency of 95 % in multiple sequences obtained from the <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> of all four patients examined. ConclusionsThe preferential use of Vβ 8 with marked similarities in the CDR 3 region by some renal infiltrating T cells suggests clonal expansion of T cells in the kidneys of some IgAN patients.

Although antibodies against SV 40 antigen detect different viruses of the polyomavirus family, immunohistochemistry is widely used to confirm the diagnosis of BK virus nephropathy in <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies.</b> Here we aimed to validate the novel silver-enhanced in situ hybridization (SISH) technique for the automated detection of BK virus in <b>renal</b> transplant <b>biopsies.</b> Two different patient cohorts were included. Twenty-nine consecutive patients suspicious for BK virus infection were investigated by SISH and chromogenic in situ hybridization. An additional 26 <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> positive by SV 40 immunohistochemistry from 19 patients were analyzed by SISH. Polyomavirus DNA serum levels, as determined by nested PCR analysis, were available {{for all of these}} patients. The presence of BK virus DNA in renal tubular cells was identified in 5 of the suspicious cases by both, SISH and chromogenic in situ hybridization. One additional patient was only positive in the SISH. In the second cohort, SISH was positive in all SV 40 positive biopsies, but SISH signals were less extensive than SV 40 immunohistochemistry. Our results show that the BK virus SISH is an ancillary tool for the detection of polyomavirus DNA in <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> using bright-field microscopy.

Our current study examined the diversity of the CDR 3 region of the γδ T-cell receptor (TCR), and characterized the junctional sequences of γδ chain TCR transcripts from T cells infiltrating <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> from patients with IgAN and in peripheral blood T cells (PBLs) from the same patients. MethodRNA extracted from <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> and PBLs of IgAN patients (N = 15) was transcribed and then amplified with primers specific for the four Vγ and six Vδ families. Controls were <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> from thin basement membrane disease (N = 6) and a sample from a kidney with suppurative pyelonephritis. CDR 3 length spectratyping and sequencing of TCR γδ-chain were used to analyze the diversity of CDR 3 region of these receptors. ResultsCDR 3 spectratyping of γδ TCR junctional diversity demonstrated that TCR γδ chains (Vγ 1 - 3 and Vδ 1 - 3) expressed by T cells from PBLs of IgAN patients and the infected kidney showed highly diverse junctional lengths that were broadly distributed. In contrast, the junctional lengths of Vγ 1 (Vγ 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8 genes) and Vδ 1 transcripts in the T cells infiltrating kidneys with IgAN were much more restricted than those of PBLs. <b>Renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> from thin basement membrane disease demonstrated no significant signal for any Vγ or Vδ family. Sequence analysis of Vγ 1 and Vδ 1 transcripts from those patients with restricted CDR 3 spectratyping profiles confirmed oligoclonal expansion of γδ T cells infiltrating the kidneys in those IgAN patients and also revealed recurrent junctional amino acid motifs in the TCR Vδ 1 chain in the kidney with IgAN. ConclusionThe data show that γδ T cells infiltrating the kidneys of IgAN patients use a restricted subset of γδ T cells, indicating clonal expansion of individual γδ T cells in the kidneys with IgAN. The feature of recurrent junctional amino acid motifs in Vδ 1 T cells may indicate antigen-driven selection...|$|R

We identified children co-infected with TB and HIV from our database and reviewed their biopsies and clinical notes. Since 2002, 12 <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> or postmortem examinations were performed on HIV-infected children at our institution. The clinical scenario and <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> in four cases (median age 73 months, range 24 - 108 months) were consistent with TB involvement. The mean CD 4 count and percentage of these four patients were 508 cells/μl and 23 %, respectively. All four patients presented with culture-proven disseminated TB (not yet on treatment) and had nephrotic range proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia. Three of these patients had renal impairment. The prominent features of the <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> were a severe interstitial inflammatory infiltrate and mild to moderate mesangial proliferation.

We report here the results of a single-center retrospective observational study of the remission rate in pediatric patients with SNRS receiving tacrolimus. Serial <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> from children on tacrolimus therapy were evaluated for tubulointerstitial fibrosis and transforming growth factor-β immunostaining. Of the 16 children with SRNS, 15 went into complete remission after a median of 120  days of therapy. Nine children were able to stop steroids, while the others were on tapering doses. Forty-seven percent had relapses, most of which were steroid-responsive. Serial <b>renal</b> <b>biopsies</b> were obtained from seven children after a median treatment duration of 24  months; two of these children had increased tubulointerstitial fibrosis and four showed increased transforming growth factor-β tissue staining. Children with worsening histological findings were younger. There was no significant association between tacrolimus exposure and biopsy changes, although the average trough level was higher in those children with worsening histological findings. In conclusion, tacrolimus may be a safe and effective alternative agent for inducing remission in children with SRNS. However, caution needs to be taken when prescribing this agent due to its narrow therapeutic index.
