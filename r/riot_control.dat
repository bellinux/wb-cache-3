The result was 18 hours of full-blown <b>rioting.</b> <b>Control</b> {{was brought to the}} town, requiring 10 days of martial law. Between the Klan and anti-Klan participants, 104 people were indicted.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{the development of a}} decision support system for crowd control. Decision support is provided by suggesting a control strategy needed to control a specific current <b>riot</b> situation. Such <b>control</b> strategies consist of deployment of several police barriers with specific barrier positions and barrier strengths needed to <b>control</b> the <b>riot.</b> The <b>control</b> strategies are derived for a set of pre-stored example situations by using genetic algorithms where successive trial strategies are evaluated using stochastic agent-based simulation. The optimal control strategy for the current situation is constructed by first finding the best linear combination of pre-stored example situations. The optimal strategy is given as the same linear combination of associated strategies...|$|R
