The suitlock docking mechanism comprises a single actuator that controls latches which, in turn, respectfully control <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>assemblies</b> that allow for easy removal and attachment of a life support equipment enclosure shell to the environmental protective suit or to the vehicle from which the operator performs his/her duties...|$|R
40|$|Researchers at Sandia have {{recently}} {{designed and built}} several research prototypes, which demonstrate that truly complex mechanical systems can now be realized in a surface micromachined technology. These MicroElectro- Mechanical Systems (MEMS) include advanced actuators, torque multiplying gear tmins, <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>assemblies,</b> positionable mirrors, <b>and</b> mechanical discriminators. All of tile mechanical components are batch fabricated on a single chip of silicon using the infrastructure origimdly developed to support today's highly reliabk; and robust microelectronics industry. Sand ia is also developing the technology 10 integrate microelectronic circuits onto the s,ime piece of silicon {{that is used to}} fabricate the MEMS devices. This significantly increases sensitivity and reliability, while fhrther reducing package size and fabrication costs.

40|$|Electrical {{power has}} become a primary necessity. Energy from ocean waves remains largely an {{untapped}} resource. The aim of the project is to generate electricity from waves. The wave energy converter (WEC) captures energy contained in the ocean waves to generate electricity. The electrical energy is generated from the mechanical work harnessed from the waves by using generator. The power production depends upon {{the intensity of the}} waves. Traditionally, in wave energy converters only the vertical motion of the buoy is converted into electricity. But in this method both the vertical and horizontal motions of the buoy is converted into electricity. The mechanism used here is the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> mechanism. The setup consists of <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion,</b> gear <b>assembly,</b> DC generator and a rectifier circuit. The buoy is fixed with the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> setup which in turn is coupled with the gear assembly and it is coupled with the generator. The gear assembly is used to increase the input speed of the generator shaft. The rectifier circuit is used to change the polarity of the current produced. A maximum of 12 V can be produced. In this paper both the vertical and horizontal motions of the buoy is converted into electricity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In general, the {{strength}} of gears is calculated using the formula of AGMA or JGMA. But these formula can not be applied directly to {{the strength}} calculation of the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of steering gear assay, because of complex tooth and contact shapes. So Lewis bending stress and Hertzian contact stress formula are generally used {{for the design of}} <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of steering gear assay. But these formula do not also give the exact stress of <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion.</b> In this paper, comparing the finite element analysis results and the experimentally measured values, it is shown that the finite element modeling technique of the <b>rack</b> <b>and</b> <b>pinion</b> of steering assay is reasonable.
