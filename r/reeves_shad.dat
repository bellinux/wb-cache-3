5000|$|Stephen Baldwin, {{the first}} choice {{for the role of}} Jack Traven, felt the {{character}} (as written in the earlier version of the script) was too much like the John McClane character from Die Hard. Director Jan de Bont then cast Keanu Reeves as Jack Traven after seeing him in Point Break. He felt that the actor was [...] "vulnerable on the screen. He's not threatening to men because he's not that bulky, and he looks great to women". Reeves did not like how the Jack Traven character came across in Graham Yost's original screenplay. He felt that there were [...] "situations set up for one-liners and I felt it was forced—Die Hard mixed with some kind of screwball comedy." [...] Jan de Bont brought in Joss Whedon a week before principal photography started to work on the script. With Reeves' input, Whedon changed Traven from being [...] "a maverick hotshot" [...] to [...] "the polite guy trying not to get anybody killed," [...] and removed the character's glib dialogue and made him more earnest. Reeves had dealt with the LAPD before on Point Break, and learned about their concern for human life, which he incorporated into Traven. One of Whedon's significant contributions was changing the character of Doug Stephens (Alan Ruck) from a lawyer ("a bad guy and he died", according to the writer) to a tourist, [...] "just a nice, totally out-of-his-depth guy". Whedon worked predominantly on the dialogue, but also created a few significant plot points, like the killing of Harry Temple. Sandra Bullock came to read for Speed with Reeves to make sure there was the right chemistry between the two actors. Originally, Bullock's character [...] "Annie" [...] was intended to be a comic-relief sidekick to Jack, with Ellen DeGeneres in mind for the part. Instead, Annie became both Jack's sidekick and later love interest. She recalls that they had to do [...] "all these really physical scenes together, rolling around on the floor and stuff." [...] The director did not want Traven to have long hair and wanted the character [...] "to look strong and in control of himself". To that end, <b>Reeves</b> <b>shaved</b> his head almost completely. The director remembers, [...] "everyone at the studio was scared shitless when they first saw it. There was only like a millimeter. What you see in the movie is actually grown in". Reeves also spent two months at Gold's Gym in Los Angeles to get in shape for the role.|$|R
