50|$|American public <b>restrooms</b> are {{regulated}} by two separate federal agencies: the U.S. Department of Labor, which governs workplace <b>restrooms,</b> and the Department of Health and Human Services, which governs non-workplace <b>restrooms.</b> Many {{places in the}} United States are legally prohibited from offering only <b>restrooms</b> for men. These regulations are mostly based on the precedent created by original legislation, though they sometimes also work to eliminate the longer wait time females often face by creating a ratio of more female <b>restrooms</b> than male <b>restrooms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{transgender}} advocates also {{advocate for}} converting single-occupant, gender-segregated <b>restrooms</b> into single-occupant, all-gender <b>restrooms</b> by simply changing the signs {{due to the}} high rates of harassment and even violence faced by the transgender community when accessing gender-segregated <b>restrooms</b> according to their gender expression. All-Gender/Gender-Neutral <b>restrooms</b> are also beneficial to nursing mothers, parents with different-sex children, and people with disabilities. Transgender advocates affirm all-gender <b>restrooms</b> as well as access to gendered <b>restrooms</b> {{as a matter of}} choice, safety, privacy, and dignity.|$|R

During her work at the Carnegie Institute, Rubin applied to observe at the Palomar Observatory in 1965, {{despite the fact that}} the building did not have facilities for women. She created her own women's <b>restroom,</b> sidestepping the lack of facilities available for her and becoming the first female astronomer to observe there.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of Brody Hall, a residence hall of Michigan State University Housing, {{was completed in}} August 2011 and qualified for LEED Silver certification because the facility includes a rain water collection tank used for <b>restroom</b> fixtures, a white PVC roof, meters that will monitor utilities {{to make sure they}} are used efficiently, and the use of recycled matter and local sources for building materials.|$|E
5|$|Billy, though experienced, {{is still}} {{somewhat}} goofy and absent-minded. He sometimes helps Harry with scenes and Harry tries {{to convince him}} too {{that he is an}} actor and not a prostitute. On several occasions, Billy picks up men only to discover that the man is not actually his client. In one case he and the man fall in love and they plan to get Billy out of the business and start a life together. Shortly thereafter, Billy mistakes a man (Michael Haynes) for a client in a public <b>restroom</b> and that man stabs him to death.|$|E

5000|$|All-gender <b>restrooms</b> are {{designed}} to ensure that <b>restrooms</b> are fully accessible to all members of society. While the issue of gender inclusive <b>restrooms</b> has been raised as an equity and human rights issue for people who identify outside of the gender binary, eliminating gender segregation in bathrooms also benefits disabled populations who may have attendants of a different gender, parents with children, and anyone who may need additional assistance using public toilet facilities. A-Gender <b>restrooms</b> can eliminate discrimination and harassment for people who may be perceived {{to be in the}} [...] "wrong" [...] bathroom.|$|R

5|$|Though {{the stadium}} was opened on time, the late sod {{was not the}} only issue on opening day. The stadium's seats, which had {{previously}} been installed in Atlanta's Fulton County Stadium, arrived just in time. Construction of the backstop was still being completed on opening day. Players for both the Sounds and the visiting Braves had concerns about the safety of playing on the quickly installed infield, initially refusing to even play on the surface.

In the <b>restroom,</b> he starts to unzip, then realizes that the bathroom {{is attached to a}} large white room with many men in white coats ready to observe and take notes on his performance. He then meets Buffy, Giles, and Spike in a playground; Spike – unaffected by daylight – tells him that Giles is going to teach him to be a Watcher, as Buffy plays in a sandbox. Xander then finds himself in an ice cream truck with Anya; Willow and Tara (wearing skimpy clothing and garish make-up) are in the back, and they invite him to join them. He tries to do so, only to end up in the basement where his parents allow him to live. He goes to the university and comes across Giles, who starts revealing the reason for the dream, but who suddenly switches to speaking in French. Xander next finds himself in a reenactment of the Apocalypse Now scene between a captive Captain Benjamin Willard and Colonel Walter Kurtz, with Principal Snyder as Kurtz.

5|$|Many day hikes can {{be taken}} in the park. Back-country camping is allowed at campsites along the trails. A permit is {{required}} and {{can be obtained from}} certain visitor centers or arranged for in advance. Much of Glacier's back country is usually inaccessible to hikers until early June due to accumulated snow pack and avalanche risk, and many trails at higher altitudes remain snow packed until July. Campgrounds that allow vehicle access are found throughout the park, most of which are near one of the larger lakes. The campgrounds at St. Mary and at Apgar are open year-round, but conditions are primitive in the off-season, as the <b>restroom</b> facilities are closed and there is no running water. All campgrounds with vehicle access are usually open from mid-June until mid-September. Guide and shuttle services are also available.|$|E
5|$|Sebring Farms {{was reduced}} to piles of rubber, with four tall royal palm trees left standing. Only six people in the town survived.

Ninety-nine people died in that town. In Chosen, only two people managed to escape a house that sheltered nineteen people. At Henry Martin's store, the building lost its roof during the storm, forcing the occupants {{to move into the}} <b>restroom.</b> A house that was full of people floated about half a mile (0.8km) from its original location. The occupants were unaware that the house was moving until it collided with a railroad embankment. Twenty three people died in Chosen.|$|E

50|$|The {{previous}} {{bridge in}} this location, built in 1930, was a humpback truss bridge with a decorative wrought iron railing. One unique feature about the 1930 bridge {{was that it}} had <b>restrooms</b> built into the bridge, underneath the sidewalk in the southwest corner next to the bridge abutment.
