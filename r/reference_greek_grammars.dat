As would be expected many Jewish texts show virtually no departures from the Koine or [...] "common Attic" [...] used by Gentile authors. Authors writing for Gentile audiences such as Josephus and Philo of Alexandria observe a standard of <b>Greek</b> <b>grammar</b> well above that of many surviving pagan sources.|$|R
