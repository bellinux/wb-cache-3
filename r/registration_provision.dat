BackgroundThe fundamental mechanisms behind the free market, such as competition, start applying also to the public health sector. Health service providers are gradually realising that patients are actual clients of health care institutions, with physicians, nurses, supporting personnel, registration officers and other staff responding to patients demand for medical and auxiliary services (e. g. exam <b>registration,</b> <b>provision</b> of information). Material and methodsPN-EN ISO 9001 : 2009 “Quality Management Systems. Requirements”, relevant literature and documentation of quality management system from the GPCC. The review of relevant literature and legal requirements; interpretation of provisions in relation to the functioning of health care institutions. ResultsModel of identification of patient's requirements and satisfaction in accordance with the requirements of ISO 9001 : 2008 has been elaborated and implemented in the GPCC. ConclusionThe identification of patient's requirements is much more complicated than evaluating the same parameters in manufacturing companies. In the context of medical services one {{should be aware of the}} subjectivity of patient's feelings, the psycho-social status and the general state of health during his or her treatment. Therefore, the identification of patient's requirements and satisfaction must be carefully thought out, implemented and regularly improved...|$|E

40|$|The {{decision}} of the High Court in Associated Alloys focuses on enforceability of a Romalpa style clause {{within the context of}} the security <b>registration</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Corporations Law. The apparent willingness of the court to uphold such a clause to the possible detriment of creditors with registered interests has been the subject of considerable controversy. Indeed, the weight of Australian and international literature on the subject suggests that such clauses are illegitimate to the extent that they compromise creditors’ interests, since they represent a device resulting in unfair surprise and inject significant uncertainty into commercial dealings. This analysis argues that such clauses have a legitimate place in the Australian legal constellation, but that the approach taken by future courts to interpreting and enforcing such clauses needs to be more commercially informed and flexible than was the case in Associated Alloys, where evidentiary rather than conceptual problems ultimately defeated the device. 12 page(s...|$|R

The result of this study showed that the compliance rate of the Notaries/Land Certificate Issuing Officers in Medan, in terms of their obligation to register themselves as Taxable Entrepreneurs was still low.

40|$|Since the {{decision}} of the Court of Appeal in the Romalpa case in the mid 1970 's there has been an ever growing use of reservation of property (Romalpa) clauses in commercial contracts for the sale of goods. The concept of a reservation of property clause is grounded in sections 19 and 21 of the Sale of Goods Act 1908 but its widespread use is a recent phenomenon. The problem to be addressed here concerns the relationship of such clauses to the Chattels Transfer Act 1924. The question is whether such clauses fall within the ambit of the definition in section 2 of the Chattels Transfer Act of "instrument" or the exclusions from the term "instrument". If they fall within the latter then they are exempt from the <b>registration</b> <b>provisions</b> of the Chattels Transfer Act. If this is so, it enables those purchasing on such terms to give a misleading impression of their substance to other creditors who may extend credit facilities in reliance on what appears to be ownership by the purchaser of substantial stock in trade.

40|$|State {{securities}} laws—in particular, {{state laws}} requiring that securities offered by issuers be {{registered with the}} states—have been an impediment to the efficient movement of capital to its highest and best use. The pernicious effects of these laws—generally referred to as “blue sky laws”—have been felt most acutely by small businesses, a vital component of our national economy. It {{has been difficult to}} remedy this problem. States and state regulators have been tenacious in protecting their registration authority from federal preemption. The Securities and Exchange Commission, on the other hand, has been reluctant to advocate for preemption and unwilling to exercise its delegated power to expand preemption by regulation. In recent years some progress has been made toward a more efficient regulation of capital formation, principally as a result of some congressional preemption of state registration authority. Nonetheless, state <b>registration</b> <b>provisions</b> continue to impede significantly businesses’—especially small businesses’—efficient access to external capital. Further gains in efficient regulation of capital formation can be achieved but require actions both by states and the federal government. States must allocate more resources and effort toward vigorous enforcement of their antifraud provisions. At the federal level, Congress must preempt completely state registration authority. This duty of preemption falls to Congress, because the Commission has shown a sustained unwillingness to exercise its broad, delegated power to preempt state registration authority...|$|R
