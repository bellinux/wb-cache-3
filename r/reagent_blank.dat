40|$|Summary: Three {{total protein}} assays were {{analyzed}} {{to determine the}} extent of deviation encountered when a constant measured <b>reagent</b> <b>blank</b> is compared to a continuously decreasing true <b>reagent</b> <b>blank.</b> This blank effect owes its regressive nature to the consumption of the active reagent ingredient by the protein reactive species, variably and sometimes, with certain reactants, nonlinearly in the presence of increasing protein concentrations. However, the blank effect of interest here is apparent only when the reagent and the reagent-protein complex present overlapping spectra and therefore absorb at the wavelength of measurement. Thus it was found that while the biuret and the Coomassie brilliant blue assays produced pronounced differences in the variable true reagent blanks, the Folin-Ciocalteau reaction did not develop a deviation from the true blank since the <b>reagent</b> <b>blank</b> does not absorb to any extent at the assay wavelength. In this manner, the latter procedure could serve äs a marker against which the former two blank reactions can be shown to display relatively excessive deviations.

The analytical data quality was guaranteed through the implementation of laboratory quality assurance and quality control methods, {{including the use of}} standard operating procedures, calibration with standards, analysis of <b>reagent</b> <b>blanks,</b> recovery of known additions, and analysis of replicates.|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hormonally active {{environmental}} {{agents have}} recently {{been associated with the}} development of endometriosis. METHODS: We undertook a study to assess the relationship between endometriosis, an estrogen-dependent gynaecological disease, and 62 individual polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs) congeners. We enrolled 84 eligible women aged 18 – 40 years undergoing laparoscopy for study, which included an interview and blood speci-men (n 5 79; 94 %). Thirty-two women had visually confirmed endometriosis at laparoscopy while 52 did not. Blood specimens were run in batches of 14 including four quality control samples for toxicological analysis. Each PCB congener was adjusted for recovery; batch-specific <b>reagent</b> <b>blanks</b> were subtracted. All PCB concentrations were log transformed and expressed in ng/g serum first as a sum and then as tertiles by purported estrogenic or anti-estrogenic activity of PCB congeners. RESULTS: Using unconditional logistic regression analysis, a signifi-cantly elevated odds ratio (OR) was observed for women in the third tertile of anti-estrogenic PCBs [OR 3. 77; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1. 12 – 12. 68]. Risk remained elevated after controlling for gravidity, current cigarette smoking and serum lipids (OR 3. 30; 95 % CI 0. 87 – 12. 46). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that anti-estrogenic PCBs may be associated with the development of endometriosis.
