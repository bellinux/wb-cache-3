40|$|ABSTRACT It {{has been}} shown that {{propagation}} of excitation in cardiac muscle is anisotropic. Compared to propagation at right angles to the long axes of the fibers, propagation along the long axis is faster, the extracellular action potential (AP) is larger in amplitude, and the intracellular AP has a lower maximum rate of depolarization, a larger time constant of the foot, and a lower peak amplitude. These observations are contrary to the predictions of classical one-dimensional (1 -D) cable theory and, thus far, no satisfactory theory forthem has been reported. As an alternative description of propagation in cardiac muscle, this study provides a quasi- 1 -D theory that includes a simplified description of the effects of action currents in extracellular space as well as resistive coupling between surface and deeper fibers in cardiac muscle. In terms of classical 1 -D theory, this quasi- 1 -D theory reveals that the anisotropies in the wave form of the AP arise from modifications in the effective membrane ionic current and capacitance. The theory also shows that it is propagation in the longitudinal, not in the transverse direction that deviates from classical 1 -D cable theory.

40|$|Understanding {{the rolling}} {{behavior}} of a micro-object is essential to establish the techniques of micro-manipulation and micro-assembly by mechanical means. Using a combined theoretical/computational approach, we studied the critical conditions of rolling resistance of an elastic cylindrical micro-object in adhesional contact with a rigid surface. Closed-form dimensionless expressions for the critical rolling moment, the initial rolling contact area, and the initial rolling angle were extracted after a systematic parametric study using finite element method (FEM) simulations. The total energy of this system {{is defined as the}} sum of three terms: the elastic energy stored in the deformed micro-cylinder, the interfacial energy within the contact area, and the mechanical potential energy that depends on the external moment applied to the cylindrical micro-object.

40|$|Spinal {{disease is}} a common yet {{important}} condition that occurs because of inappropriate posture. Prevention could be achieved by continuous posture monitoring, but most measurement systems cannot be used in daily life due to factors such as burdensome wires and large sensing modules.

The hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) of intact root segments was determined by applying gradients of hydrostatic and osmotic pressure across the root cylinder. In hydrostatic experiments, Lpr was constant along the segment except for an apical zone of approximately 20 millimeters in length which was hydraulically isolated due to a high axial resistance.

Except for the apical 20 millimeters, radial water movement was limiting water uptake into the root. This is important for the evaluation of Lpr of roots from root pressure relaxations.

40|$|Multiwalled carbon {{nanotubes}} {{are shown}} to be ballistic conductors at room temperature, with mean free paths {{of the order of}} tens of microns. The measurements are performed both in air and in high vacuum in the transmission electron microscope on nanotubes that protrude from unprocessed arc-produced nanotube-containing fibers that contact with a liquid metal surface. These experiments follow and extend the original experiments by Frank et al. (Science 1998, 280 1744), which demonstrated {{for the first time the}} large current carrying capability, very low intrinsic resistivities, and evidence for quantized conductance.

The nanotube-metal contact resistances are in the range from 0. 1 to 1 k¿ím. Contact scattering can explain why the measured conductances are about half of the expected theoretical value of 2 G 0. For V> 0. 1 V, the conductance rises linearly (dG/dV 0. 3 G 0 /V) reflecting the linear increase in the density-of-states in a metallic nanotube above the energy gap. Increased resistances (F) 2 - 10 k¿/ ím) and anomalous I-V dependences result from impurities and surfactants on the tubes. Evidence is presented that ballistic transport occurs in undoped and undamaged tubes for which the top layer is metallic and the next layer is semiconducting.

40|$|Conventional CMOS-technology {{defined by}} optical {{lithography}} will reach its physical limits {{within the next}} years together with technologies adopted for data storage. This work presents and combines the alternative concepts of resistively switching devices, usable as nonvolatile memory elements or switches, and nano crossbar architecture, which defer these physical limits sustainably. The nano crossbar architecture consists of a functional component that is integrated between two perpendicularly crossing metallization lines. This configuration allows for a high integration density due to a minimal footprint of 4 F² (F = minimum Feature size). The basic elements are straight metallization lines with excellent scaling capability and fabricated by competitive technologies such as nano imprint lithography. The functional component can be composed of reversibly switching TiO 2, which is integrated into metal/ insulator/ metal elements (MIM). This can be operated by corresponding set- and reset- voltages between at least two resistance states, which represent a logic " 0 " or " 1 ". The state is nonvolatile and can be nondestructively determined by voltages below these programming values. The field of application includes memory matrices, which are also named passive ReRAM (Resistive Random Access Memory), elements of the DRL (Diode-Resistor Logic) and RTL (Resistor-Transistor Logic), as well as router and multiplexer. Because of their passive properties, an active control circuitry, which is currently based upon CMOS, is necessary. For this reason, all materials and fabrication technologies are CMOS compatible. The developed and optimized lift-off metallization in combination with electron beam direct writing is a flexible method to fabricate metallization lines with different metals and with a width of 50 nm. The fabricated devices comprise crossbar arrays with a size of 64 × 64 bit and a 30 nm thermally evaporated electrode of a Pt/ Ti double layer. These were examined in terms of ballistic charge transfer mechanisms, since {{the dimensions of the}} conductor were in the range of the electron mean free path. The experimental results could be explained by the models of Fuchs-Sondheimer and Mayadas-Shatzkes. Finally, the metal lines offered a high yield and a good scalability with low <b>resistances</b> <b>per</b> <b>unit</b> <b>length.</b> The TiO 2 thin film was reactively sputtered or deposited by ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition). Subsequently, the electrical transfer from the insulating to the switching state, also called electroforming, was examined in detail and allowed for a reliable bipolar switching. The required operating voltages and currents of 100 × 100 nm² large cells are 2 V and several 100 µA, respectively, which are appropriate values for a combination with CMOS technology. Additionally, the gained resistance ratio of more than 100 offers a good detection of the stored information. This information is nonvolatile without any degradation for more than 10 ^ 5 s, also at elevated temperatures of 85 °C. The switching speed was measured by short voltage pulses and is less than 10 ns. At the same time, it is possible to vary the value of the HRS (High Resistive State) depending on the pulse length and amplitude. The multitude of achievable states enables the development of a multi-bit storage element that increases the storage density without an increase of the technological complexity. The interaction of adjacent functional elements was examined by programming of a set of neighboring junctions inside of an array. The subsequent readout of these elements showed no mutual influence for distances above 200 nm and the switching characteristic was consistent with that one of single elements. Each junction that was not electroformed inhibited parasitic currents in the bypasses of an array. The number of programmable bits is thus limited due to the high electroforming voltages of the examined material system. The combination of both concepts shows the high potential of resistively switching elements in nano crossbar architecture. However, the operation of a complete array with the combination of Pt/TiO 2 /Ti/Pt has to be optimized in respect of the electroforming. Nevertheless, this material system offers a high potential for future ReRAM applications, first of all in combination with a select transistor...|$|R
