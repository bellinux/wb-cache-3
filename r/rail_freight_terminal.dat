V/Line uses the tracks south of South Kensington for the reversal of trains operating on the Traralgon and Bairnsdale lines to avoid blocking other trains at Southern Cross Station. Other than standard gauge services, V/Line do not operate passenger services along the line, except in times of disruptions to normal routes.|$|R

40|$|The results {{presented}} in this article identify the role of costs in the scientific and grey <b>freight</b> <b>terminal</b> handling literature and analyses the handling costs of different terminal sizes. The literature review shows that handling costs only play a marginal role in the scientific research in intermodal <b>rail</b> <b>freight</b> <b>terminals</b> (IRT). This is remarkable given the large role costs occupy in decision-making in freight transport. Furthermore, the used cost levels show a wide range of proposed amounts and terminal sizes or handling technologies are seldom addressed. Finally, many of the scientific papers do not make it clear whether the average transhipment cost or market price is referred to. Next, the analysis of the investment in, and cost structure of, IRTs shows that IRT investments are very capital-intensive leading to relatively high average costs per handling. However, given the cost characteristics of IRTs, the average cost per handling represents the underlying cost structure and are – in this sense – representative. The cost analysis demonstrates that extra-large IRTs actually have the lowest average handling costs, followed by small IRTs. </p...|$|R

50|$|Passenger {{traffic was}} {{the main source of}} revenue for the Southern Railway {{throughout}} its existence, although goods were also carried in separate trains. Goods such as milk and cattle from the agricultural areas of the West Country provided a regular source of freight traffic, whilst imports from the south coast ports also required carriage by <b>rail</b> to <b>freight</b> <b>terminals</b> such as the large Bricklayers Arms facility. The railway operated three large marshalling yards for freight on the outskirts of South London, at Feltham, Norwood and Hither Green, where freight could be sorted for onward travel to their final destinations. It also handled a large volume of cross-London freight from these to other yards north of the river via the West London and East London Lines which were jointly owned by the Southern Railway.|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} <b>freight</b> {{transport}} by <b>rail</b> {{is a complex}} theme and, in recent years, a main issue of European policy. The legislation evolution, the White Paper 2011 and many research projects promoted by EU Commission, e. g. Capacity 4 Rail (C 4 R), have demonstrated the European intention to re-launch this sector. One of the main objectives of C 4 R Project {{is to improve the}} performances of railway freight transport to reduce the market share of road freight transport. In this context railway <b>freight</b> <b>terminals</b> play a primary role for the supply chain: they are the connection among the various transport modes and the nodal points where the freight are handled, stored and transferred or shunted to final customer. Objects of this paper are methods and main results achieved by the research group of DICEA within the C 4 R Project. The main objective is to contribute to the increase of <b>rail</b> <b>freight</b> traffic through the development of future <b>freight</b> <b>terminals,</b> based both on innovative operational measures (e. g. horizontal and parallel handling, faster and fully direct handling) and on innovative technologies (e. g. automatic system for horizontal and parallel handling, automated gate for data exchange, driverless locomotives). The research work focusses on the assessment of potential effects of these innovations in railway <b>freight</b> <b>terminals.</b> Operational measures and technologies compose different scenarios, to evaluate by a methodological approach including both analytical methods and simulation models. The output of this assessment methods are key performance indicators (KPIs), e. g. total/partial transit time, setup according to analysed terminal typologies and related to different aspects (e. g. management, operation and organization). Finally, in addition to illustrated methodological framework, some results on selected case studies include the intermodal Munich-Riem <b>rail</b> to road <b>freight</b> <b>terminal</b> (Germany), the Hallsberg marshalling yard (Sweden) and the intermodal Principe Felipe rail-sea <b>freight</b> <b>terminal</b> in Valencia port (Spain) ...|$|R
