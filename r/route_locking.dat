5000|$|Winchester Chesil {{station was}} chosen for an {{innovative}} system of signalling, developed in about 1923 by L M G Ferreira of Siemens Brothers and Co Ltd and R J Insell of the GWR. A route setting frame was installed, with miniature levers: the frame was small, measuring 2 ft 10 in by 2 ft 4 in (863 mm by 711 mm). It was a forerunner of the one control switch system; the levers set up routes; when the lever was moved to mid-stroke the interlocking proved that the route was free and no conflicting move had been set up; and the points moved to the required position, after which the lever could be moved to the reverse position and the signal cleared. There were 16 miniature levers and 15 routes could be selected; the sixteenth was a king lever. The points were operated by a 120-volt supply from the signal box. Track circuits were provided at the points: they were described as [...] "point protection tracks", that is, <b>route</b> <b>locking</b> track circuits, {{but there were no}} track circuits in the plain line. The night illumination was provided by oil lamps except for two signals located in the tunnel; ground signals were miniature semaphores of novel design.|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{improving}} the passing capacity of a station without adding any track and equipment is proposed in this paper. In the process of handling train routes, by transforming the existing fixed train-approaching locking section into a variable mode, the <b>route</b> <b>locking</b> time is shortened and in-station resource consumption is reduced. This approach improves {{the capacity of the}} station. At the same time, delay of the train can be quickly returned to normal. A method of variable train-approaching locking section is discussed; a mathematical model for increasing station passing capacity is shown. Comparison between the impact of a variable train-approaching locking section and a fixed mode on the station passing capacity is shown...|$|E
3000|$|The system {{elements}} are assigned a {{value based on}} the interlocking table. For instance, if a train requires the route R 1 and if the requirements {{for the opening of}} the route have been fulfilled, (which means the rail blocks are available and no counter <b>route</b> is <b>locked),</b> then that particular <b>route</b> is <b>locked.</b> After having the <b>route</b> <b>locked,</b> points are arranged and locked. Afterwards, the signal state changes according to the interlocking table. Also, the motion of the train is determined based on the signal and point states and the moving direction.

50|$|A {{road that}} {{stretched}} from Raleigh to Fayetteville crossed the Cape Fear River via the Northington Ferry {{and served as}} the area's major transportation <b>route.</b> <b>Locks</b> and dams were built along the river to facilitate navigation by boat, and Raven Rock became an important landmark for river pilots. After a hurricane destroyed the locks and dams in 1859, the structures were not replaced; railroad transportation eliminated the need for river travel. As new roads were built, the ferry was closed and Raven Rock became a popular recreation spot. The remnants of the Northington lock and dam can still {{be seen in the}} park.|$|R

50|$|Steuer is {{best known}} today for his {{successful}} defense of the factory owners after the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. In March 1911 a fire broke out on the eighth floor of the factory, and quickly spread to the ninth and tenth floors. The escape <b>routes</b> were <b>locked</b> or overcome by the fire. One hundred forty-six women, adolescent girls, and men lost their lives. Steuer defended the owners, Max Blanck and Isaac Harris, against criminal charges arising from the fire and its circumstances. The two were acquitted. The acquittal is attributed to Steuer's cross-examination and impeachment {{of one of the}} surviving employees.|$|R

25|$|LZB {{consists}} of equipment {{on the line}} {{as well as on}} the trains. A 30–40km segment of track is controlled by a LZB control center. The control center computer receives information about occupied blocks from track circuits or axle counters and <b>locked</b> <b>routes</b> from interlockings. It is programmed with the track configuration including the location of points, turnouts, gradients, and curve speed limits. With this, it has sufficient information to calculate how far each train may proceed and at what speed.|$|R

The highway heads northward as the two-lane Bridge Street, serving a block of homes as it intersects Alexander Drive and Leonard Road. An intersection with Riverside Drive marks {{the end of the second}} block and the start of the third, where NY 103 passes the only bit of commercial activity along the highway. From here, the route leaves the hamlet and begins to rise as it crosses a steel truss bridge over the Mohawk River, here part of the Erie Canal. The last third of the span crosses Erie Canal Lock 9. On the north side of the river, the <b>route</b> serves <b>Lock</b> 9 State Park before terminating at an intersection with NY 5 in a rural part of the town of Glenville.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the <b>route</b> to <b>locking</b> in class B lasers subject to optically injected light for injection strengths and detunings near a codimension-two saddle-node Hopf point. This is the parameter region where the Adler approximation is not valid and where Yeung and Strogatz recently reported a self-similar cascade of periodic orbits {{in the case}} of a solid-state laser. We explain this cascade as an accumulation of large regions bounded by saddle-node bifurcations of periodic orbits, but also containing further bifurcations, such as period-doubling, torus bifurcations and small pockets of chaos. In the vicinity of the simultaneous saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations, successive periodic orbits wind more and more near the point in phase space where the saddle-node bifurcation is about to occur. This leads to a self-similar period-adding cascade. By varying the linewidth enhancement parameter α from zero, the case of a solid-state or C...|$|R
50|$|The Charente was {{described}} by the French king François I as ‘la plus belle rivière du royaume’, and was navigable in its natural state until mills were erected at many locations in the 14th century. Some locks were built but through navigation remained impossible for centuries. Improvements to the navigation were projected under Louis XVI in 1772, but work was interrupted by the Revolution. The project was revived under the Restoration and canalisation completed in 1835. The waterway was abandoned in 1957. The départements took over operation in 1963, and recreational vessels have now taken possession of the waterway throughout the 164 km {{to the town of}} Angoulême. The historic towns of Cognac, Jarnac, Saintes and Rochefort make the river a popular destination for boaters, mainly in rental boats, with moorings provided at most towns and villages along the <b>route.</b> The <b>locks</b> are 34 by 6 metres ft.|$|R
50|$|By 1837 {{the canal}} {{had been so}} {{successful}} that the company spent five years acquiring land for and then building the newer Enlarged Erie Canal, to handle larger shipping. The <b>route,</b> and several <b>locks,</b> can still be seen and followed from {{the northeast corner of}} the district to Lock 18 near the western city limit. Main Street today follows the original canal bed. In {{the northern part of the}} city, former land of the original Erie Canal was reacquired in 1846 by the Cohoes Company for its local power canal system.|$|R

Competition for Mexican workers grew so high among labor contractors that it inspired a short-lived coyote system in the United States. For a fee, “man-snatchers” would kidnap Mexican workers from one company and deliver them to a competing firm.

50|$|The village's {{population}} grew to about 2,500 in {{the mid-19th century}} because the Grand River was an important commercial <b>route.</b> There were <b>locks</b> constructed at Indiana just north of Cayuga. However, when the Welland Canal was completed, the Grand became an obsolete route. Further, an impassable dam was built down river from Cayuga at Dunnville. Although originally part of the Welland Canal, {{the purpose of the}} dam and a canal at Port Maitland is to keep the level of the Welland Canal consistent. Presently the population of Cayuga has recovered to approximately 1,500 after having been around 1,000 for almost a century.|$|R
5000|$|This latest {{controversy}} {{was just}} what Macdonald was waiting for. Pointing out the huge differences in the two estimates, on 8 October 1887 he formed the Trent Valley Canal Commission to study the issue. This was immediately denounced as a measure [...] "to give {{them an opportunity to}} get out of the work." [...] This is precisely what happened; the first meeting of the Commission was not scheduled until 1 April 1888, and the final report was not expected until after the next election. A series of interviews were carried out and questionnaires sent which garnered little response, which the Commission took as evidence that there was little interest in the topic. In 1890 an interim report caused Macdonald to suggest that [...] "Some further enquiry is necessary". One of the few positive results was a measure of the water supply by the new chief engineer of the Trent, Richard Rogers, that suggested there was a million times more water available than would be needed for the entire <b>route</b> to <b>lock</b> 100 times a day for the 200-day navigation period.|$|R
