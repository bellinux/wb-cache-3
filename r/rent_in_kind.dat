25|$|The {{basis of}} estate {{agriculture}} in Nyasaland {{for much of}} the colonial period was the system of thangata which, in the early colonial period, meant that African on estates had to perform agricultural labour in lieu of the rent for a plot of land on which they could grow food. At first, estates usually required two months’ labour a year from adult men, one month for rent, the second for Hut tax. However, on some estates the obligations of labour tenants were extended, and abuses such as requiring 30 days work (five weeks of six days) for each month of thangata or requiring that women heading households should work were introduced. The demand for estate labour declined in the 1920s, and British Central Africa Company was the first estate owner to modify thangata. The company issued seed to African tenants so that they could grow cotton or tobacco under supervision, and then sell their crops to the company at low prices. The Natives on Private Estates Ordinance 1928 formalised this arrangement by allowing landlords to receive rents in cash, in a fixed quantity of acceptable crops or by direct labour. The term thangata applied both to <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> common on tobacco and cotton estates, and to the older form of labour thangata, which persisted on the tea estates that required direct labour.|$|E

As {{the demand for}} estate labour declined in the 1920s, the owners had insufficient work for their tenants to meet their thangata obligations and claimed that they had become rent-free squatters who should be evicted if they refused to grow economic crops. Larger estates were saved from collapse by replacing direct labour with the scheme of tenants growing cotton and tobacco and selling these to the planters at low prices.

6000|$|This {{is but a}} guess on my part. But {{all other}} {{explanations}} are only guesses likewise, {{because we do not}} know how business was transacted in those days and in that country. We do not know whether these debtors were tenants, paying <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> or traders to whom goods had been advanced, or what they were. We do not know whether the steward was agent of the estate, or house steward, or what he was. But this we do know--that to mend one act of villainy by committing a fresh one, is not wisdom, but foolishness; and we may be sure that our Lord would never have held up the unjust steward as an example to us, or quoted his master's opinion of him, if all he did was to commit fraud on fraud, and make bad worse, thereby risking his own more utter ruin. And this view of the parable surely agrees with our Lord's own lesson, which He draws from it. [...] "And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of righteousness." [...] But what does that mean? Wise men have been puzzled by that text as much as by the parable; but surely our Lord Himself explains it in the verses which follow: [...] "He that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much; and he that is unjust in that which is least, is unjust also in much." [...] He that is FAITHFUL. The unjust steward was commended for acting wisely. Now, it seems the way to act wisely is to act faithfully--that is honestly. Our Lord bids us copy the unjust steward, and make ourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness. Now, it seems, He tells us that the way to make friends of men by money transactions is to deal faithfully and honestly by them. [...] This then was perhaps why the Lord commended the unjust steward, because he had been converted in time, and seen his true interest; and for once at least in his life become just. He had found out that after all, honesty is the best policy; as God grant all of us may find out if any of us have not found it out already. Honesty is the best policy. [...] Faithfulness, as our Lord calls it, is the true wisdom. And in that, as our Lord says, the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light. The children of this world, the plain worldly men of business, find that to conduct their business they must be faithful, diligent, punctual, accurate, cautious, business-like. They must have practical common sense, which is itself a kind of honesty. [...] They must be men of their word, just and true in their dealings, or sooner or later, they will fail. Their schemes, their money, their credit, their character, will fail them, and they will be overwhelmed by ruin.|$|E

[...] Its principles had been perfectly familiar to Celtic Scotland, but had rested on a body of traditional customs (as in Homeric Greece), rather than on written laws and charters signed and sealed. Among the Celts the local tribe had been, theoretically, the sole source of property in land. In proportion as they were near of kin to the recognised tribal chief, families held lands by a tenure of three generations; but if they managed to acquire abundance of oxen, which they let out to poorer men for <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> and labour, they were apt to turn the lands which they held only temporarily, [...] "in possession," [...] into real permanent property.

60|$|Now, {{suppose that}} these debtors were the very men {{whom he had}} been cheating.

They were, probably, tenants under his lord, paying their <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> as was often the custom in the East. One rented an olive garden, and paid for it so many measures of oil; another rented corn-land, and paid so many measures of meal.

30|$|These {{marginal}} landholdings and fragmentation {{were further}} exacerbated {{when the government}} allotted part of their Tsamdro customary landholdings (discussed in the ‘Types of grazing rights to pasture resources’ section) to new immigrant settlers {{in the south in}} the 1970 s. The herders indicated that in the past some of them initially leased part of their Tsamdros to early Lhotshampa (term used in Bhutan to refer to southern Bhutanese of Nepalese ethnicity) settlers. Herders said that as new settlers started settling in the south they cultivated part of herders’ Tsamdro land and paid annual <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind.</b> This became one of the incentives for the herders to migrate seasonally. However, this practice of renting part of Tsamdro was said to have ended after the government allotted land to the settlers in their own name. This reduction in Tsamdro grazing areas led herders to look for additional income-generating activities to supplement their income and food produced from their cattle and smaller landholdings.|$|R

50|$|In {{the early}} Meiji period, landowners {{collected}} {{a high rate}} of <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind,</b> rather than cash and consequently {{played a major role in}} the development of agriculture, since the tenant farmers found it difficult to obtain capital.

2500|$|Finally, the {{plantations}} {{and their}} related agricultural development radically altered Ireland's ecology and physical appearance. [...] In 1600, most of Ireland was heavily wooded, {{apart from the}} bogs. Most of the population lived in small townlands, many migrating seasonally to fresh pastures for their cattle. By 1700, Ireland's native woodland had been decimated; it was intensively exploited by the new settlers for commercial ventures such as shipbuilding, {{as much of the}} English forests had been destroyed and the navy was becoming a great power. Several native species, such as the wolf, were hunted to extinction during this period. Most of the settler population was urbanized, living in permanent towns or villages. Some of the Irish peasantry continued their traditional practices. By the end of the plantation period, almost all of Ireland had become integrated into a market economy.

Apart from the elderly or widows, all should pay <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> cash, <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> or by providing labour. The owners should also have the right to evict surplus tenants to stop their estates becoming overcrowded. The Colonial Office opposed abolishing rights under non-disturbance clauses without a long fixed tenancies, and a five-year term was agreed. By the time legislation was prepared in 1928, there was little demand for more plantations, as the existing estates were ending direct production in favour of marketing tenants’ produce. The legislation enacted in 1928 therefore emphasised that rents could be satisfied by delivering a fixed quantity of acceptable crops to the owner as well as by direct labour or in cash.

I must do him the justice to say that when he forwarded the work of destruction it was with the hope and intention of employing the materials in a better edifice; and that no man opposed the sacrilegious temper of the age more bravely. The monasteries, in the dissolution of which he rejoiced as much as he regretted the infamous disposal of their spoils, delayed the growth of pauperism, by the corrodies with which they were charged; the effect of these reservations on the part of the founders and benefactors being, that a comfortable and respectable support was provided for those who grew old in the service of their respective families; and there existed no great family, and perhaps no wealthy one, which had not entitled itself thus to dispose of some of its aged dependants. And the extent of the depopulating system was limited while those houses endured: because though some of the great abbots were not less rapacious than the lay lords, and more criminal, the heads in general could not be led, like the nobles, into a prodigal expenditure, the burthen of which fell always upon the tenants; and <b>rents</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> were to them more convenient than in money, their whole economy being founded upon that system, and adapted to it.|$|R

40|$|The {{object of}} this paper is to outline the history of the village of Brodnia to the early 17 th century. The village, now {{situated}} in the commune of Pęczniew, in the Sieradz province, was in the past (to the time of partitions) in the district and province of Sieradz. As a royal property it belonged to the Sieradz district (starostwo) and later to the so-called tenure of Szadek. The origins of Brodnia are not known though they may go back to the 11 th century of even to earlier times. It was a prince’s village. Between 1288 and 1298 it was given by Władysław Łokietek (the Short) to Stoigniew, castellan of Ruda, yet in 1298 the King exchanged it for another of this properties. In the early 14 th century a farm was founded there and about the middle of that century a tower was built on the mound within the farm. It served as a centre of farm administration and also as a residence of the king during his visits to Brodnia. In the times of Władysław Jagiełło courts in curia were held there around the Palm Sunday. Written sources mention 18 visits of this King to Brodnia, linked with his habit of touring the country. This practice was abandoned by later kings; only one of them, Casimir Jagiellończyk, was once at Brodnia in 1450. The royal visits to Brodnia doubtless contributed to its economic development. When the royal tours of the country were discontinued, the tower on mound ceased to perform its function and was abandoned in the mid- 15 th century and destroyed by fire in the middle of the next century. In the 14 th century Brodnia was probably founded under the German law. The foundation documents is not known. That Brodnia must have been in the possession of that law is attested by mentions of the 16 th- 17 th centuries referring to the village administrators (scultetus) or to fields that belonged to them. About the middle of the 16 th century their office was abolished at Brodnia and the endowed lands (2 lanei) were incorporated into the farm land. Farming was the basic occupation of the inhabitants of Brodnia who, however, pursued other occupations such ad crafts, fishing and bee-keeping as well. As testified by the inspection of crown lands in 1564 - 1565, their lot was not too hard. Though they paid money rent and <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> <b>kind</b> (cereals, hens, cheese, eggs, butter, etc.), their villein service was not an arduous one. Yet the inspection of 1628 - 1632 shows that by the end of the 16 th and in the early 17 th century the villein service became dominant. At that time feudal opression grew in intensity. Since Brodnia was a fairly well developed village, it brought profit to kings. For this reason, certain suras bequeathed by our monarchs to the magnates were drawn on the village profits; the village was also given as pledge for money lent. It should yet be mentioned that a small church, affiliated to the parish church at the village of Glinno, was built there probably in the 14 th century. It was under the care of a curate first mentioned m 1417.

25|$|European owners wanted <b>rent</b> <b>in</b> cash, <b>kind</b> or labour {{at their}} {{discretion}} {{and the ability}} to select tenants and workers and evict those they did not want, without reference to any customs that restricted these objectives. Africans wanted to occupy estate land under the same conditions as Trust Land: rent-free, without any obligation to provide labour or sell crops to the estate owner, and following traditional customs. Abrahams saw these views as irreconcilable and considered that African residents in estates should be “emancipated”, free to leave the estate and be resettled on Trust Land or to stay on terms negotiated with the owner, not imposed by legislation. This could not be done while much Native Trust Land was overcrowded, so the unused and under-used estate land needed to be acquired for the re-settlement of those leaving estates and also to accommodate some of the excess population already on Trust Land. Abrahams thought that the majority of estate residents would choose to leave, so the owners could then develop the remaining largely unoccupied parts of their estates.|$|R
