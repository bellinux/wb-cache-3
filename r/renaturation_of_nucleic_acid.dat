40|$|Purified {{heterogeneous}} nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A 1 protein, {{which is}} found in vivo associated with heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA), promotes the rapid <b>renaturation</b> <b>of</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> strands. Maximal renaturation activity requires the glycine-rich carboxyl-terminal one-third of the protein, although the amino-terminal two-thirds also has activity. The A 1 -mediated reaction is second-order with respect to complementary DNA concentration, and the renaturation rate constant at 37 degrees C with A 1 is about 3000 -fold greater than {{in the absence of}} the protein. At 60 degrees C, the A 1 -mediated renaturation rate is even faster, and is about 300 -fold greater than protein-free reactions carried out at 68 degrees C in 1 M NaCl. Provided that sufficient A 1 protein is present to coat all strands in solution, the presence of nonhomologous, single-stranded DNA does not significantly inhibit the reaction. Moreover, renaturation of short strands to their complement contained in very long strands is nearly as efficient as between two short strands. These results indicate that A 1 may be useful for procedures that rely on nucleic acid renaturation. We propose that A 1 promotes rapid renaturation primarily by reducing the entropic barrier of bimolecular strand association through relatively transient interactions between A 1 -coated strands. Such interactions, mediated by flexible repeating domains, may act generally to increase the association kinetics of highly specific molecular assemblies in processes such as RNA maturation, transcription, translation, and transport...|$|E
40|$|UV {{absorbance}} spectrophotometry {{is widely}} used for the quantification <b>of</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids.</b> For accurate quantification {{it is important to}} determine the hypochromocity of the oligonucleotide or complex <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> structure. The use of thermal denaturation studies in conjunction with UV spectrophotometry to determine hypochromicity requires prolonged, elevated temperatures, which may cause partial hydrolysis of RNA. In addition, dsRNA is difficult to denature even at elevated temperature and the extinction coefficients <b>of</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> are also affected by temperature, which makes it difficult to accurately determine the <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration. To overcome these caveats, we have utilised the chemical denaturant dimethyl sulfoxide which, in conjunction with a short thermal denaturation prevents <b>renaturation</b> <b>of</b> the duplex <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> (dsDNA/RNA). Using this approach, we have measured the absorbance of both the unstructured and structured <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> to accurately measure their hypochromicity and determine their extinction coefficients. For a range of different dsRNA we have for the first time determined values of 46. 18 - 47. 29 µg/ml/A 260 for the quantification of dsRNA using UV spectrophotometry. Moreover, this approach enables the accurate determination of the relative proportion <b>of</b> duplex <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> in mixed ds/ss <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> solutions, demonstrating significant advantages over current methods...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} by which tumor microenvironments modulate nucleic acid-mediated innate immunity remain unknown. Here, we identified the receptor TIM- 3 as key to circumventing the stimulatory effects <b>of</b> <b>nucleic</b> <b>acids</b> in tumor immunity.
