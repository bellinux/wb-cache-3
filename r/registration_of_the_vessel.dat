50|$|A {{government}} surveyor performs {{ship registration}} surveys, surveys of foreign-going ships and local draft, and generally enforces ship safety standards to insure marine industrial safety. Government-appointed marine surveyors, also called marine inspectors in some countries, belong to two {{groups that are}} not mutually exclusive: Flag State surveyors report to the government with whom the vessel is registered, and Port State surveyors report to the government into whose territory the vessel has entered. The Port State surveyors usually {{have the authority to}} detain vessels considered to have defects that may result in adverse impacts on life or the environment. Based on their government's legal framework, Flag State surveyors can impose conditions on the vessel such that failure to comply will result in the <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> being suspended or withdrawn. In this event, the vessel will find it almost impossible to trade.|$|E
40|$|International audienceDuring {{brain tumor}} surgery, {{planning}} and guidance {{are based on}} pre-operative images which do not account for brain-shift. However, this shift is {{a major source of}} error in neuro-navigation systems and affects <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> procedure. The vascular tree is extracted from pre-operative Magnetic Resonance Angiography and from intra-operative Doppler ultrasound images, which provides sparse information on brain deformations. The pre-operative images are then updated based on an elastic <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blood <b>vessels,</b> driven by a patient-specific biomechanical model. This biomechanical model is used to extrapolate the deformation to the surrounding soft tissues. Quantitative results on a single surgical case are provided, with an evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> execution time for each processing step. Our method is proved to be efficient to compensate for brain deformation while being compatible with a surgical process...|$|R
40|$|Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty is {{currently}} the preferred method for treatment of coronary artery disease in vivo. X-ray images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coronary arteries filled with a radio-opaque contrast dye are acquired to localise <b>the</b> lesion. One <b>of</b> these images is displayed on a monitor and will serve as roadmap to navigate the interventional instruments under constant x-ray surveillance. The interventional images are displayed in real-time on a second monitor next to the roadmap monitor. It depends on the physician's ability to correlate the images on both monitors and estimate <b>the</b> actual position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guidewire within <b>the</b> <b>vessel</b> tree in order to steer it further. The navigation task is hindered by <b>the</b> constant movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart within the chest cavity and <b>the</b> static nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> angiographic roadmap. <b>The</b> main goal <b>of</b> this work is to present a novel image registration framework to enable navigation and positioning aids for cardiac catheterisation procedures to reduce interventional time. This task is accomplished by enhancing <b>the</b> visualisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> procedure by means of overlaying onto each interventional frame a roadmap that exhibits <b>the</b> coronary <b>vessels</b> in a similar position and with a similar shape, and by fusing information acquired from Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS). To this end, we characterise each acquired frame by a heart state vector, which main components are respiration state and heart contraction state. The latter is calculated from the ECG signal, and we propose and evaluate a multimodality similarity measure based on mutual information to measure the respiration state from the image content. With these two characteristic parameters, each image can be represented in a two-dimensional graph where nearby points represent images that show the heart in a similar state and position. Furthermore, methods to refine <b>the</b> <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> visible in <b>the</b> roadmap and the instrument visible in the interventional frames by respiration compensation and accurate device to vessel registration are proposed. A flexible software architecture is developed to ease transfer from research activities to a clinical setting and test <b>the</b> real-time performance <b>of</b> these algorithms. To aid accurate positioning, we present a novel multimodality application to fuse IVUS and projection x-ray images. IVUS images are related to their acquisition locations in the diagnostic angiograms or to instrument positions during the intervention by means of respiration compensation and accurate device to vessel registration. A reconstruction algorithm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three-dimensional pullback path for projection x-ray sequences is also proposed. The two-dimensional registration algorithm for IVUS and angiography is tested in a heart phantom...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, the {{relation}} between retinal vessel diameters and glaucoma by means of advanced image processing techniques is examined. Eighteen (18) patients with ocular hypertension who converted to early glaucoma (converters) and nineteen (19) patients with ocular hypertension who remain stable (non-converters) were imaged with a fundus camera at regular intervals. The first acquired image serves as the reference image, which is compared to each follow-up image. The proposed methodology involves <b>the</b> extraction <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> centerlines by means <b>of</b> differential calculus, <b>the</b> geometrical alignment (<b>registration)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> images using the chamfer matching algorithm, <b>the</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>vessel</b> diameters by fitting a Gaussian function to intensity profiles. <b>The</b> statistical analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> diameters revealed {{a significant difference between}} the two populations.

40|$|Direct volume {{visualization}} of computer tomography data {{is based on}} <b>the</b> mapping <b>of</b> data values to colors and opacities with lookup-tables known as transfer functions. Often, limitations of one-dimensional transfer functions become evident {{when it comes to}} <b>the</b> visualization <b>of</b> aneurysms close <b>the</b> skull base. Computer tomography angiography data is used for <b>the</b> 3 D-representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessels</b> filled with contrast medium. The reduced intensity differences between osseous tissue and contrast medium lead to strong artifacts and ambiguous visualizations. We introduced <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> bidimensional transfer functions based on measured intensities and gradient magnitudes for <b>the</b> visualization <b>of</b> aneurysms involving <b>the</b> skull base. The obtained results are clearly superior to a standard approach with one-dimensional transfer functions. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> additional degree <b>of</b> freedom increases <b>the</b> difficulty involved in creating adequate TFs. In order to address this problem, we introduce automatic adjustment of bidimensional TFs through a <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> respective 2 D histograms. Initially, a dataset is set as reference and the information contained in its 2 D histogram (intensities and gradient magnitudes) is used to create a transfer function template which produces a clear visualization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>vessels.</b> When a new dataset is examined, elastic <b>registration</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reference and target 2 D histograms is carried out.
