5000|$|The dopped {{stone is}} ground at precise angles and indexes on cutting laps of {{progressively}} finer grit, {{and then the}} process is repeated a final time to polish each facet. Accurate <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> <b>angles</b> in the cutting and polishing process is aided by the angle readout and index gear. The physical process of polishing is a subject of debate. One commonly accepted {{theory is that the}} fine abrasive particles of a polishing compound produce abrasions smaller than the wavelengths of light, thus making the minute scratches invisible. Since gemstones have two sides (the crown and pavilion), a device often called a [...] "transfer jig" [...] is used to flip the stone so that each side may be cut and polished.|$|E

The Brick House, also rectangular, faces the Glass House, but a nearby concrete, circular sculpture by Donald Judd (untitled, 1971) and small circular pools {{on either side}} of it serve to soften the rectangular effect, although structures and objects throughout the estate are arranged to show patterns or <b>repetitions</b> <b>of</b> curves and <b>angles.</b>|$|R
40|$|This work {{aimed at}} {{presenting}} {{the idea of}} inventor Dr. Kenzo Kase that kinesio tape application with proximal base leads to muscle contraction facilitation and application with distal base leads to muscle contraction inhibition. Twenty male volleyball players with the dominant shoulder girdle muscle imbalance {{between the ages of}} 25 and 30 participated in this study. There were compared two techniques which were placed on biceps brachii muscle in shoulder and elbow joint extension. Isokinetic tests flexion and extension of elbow joint with HUMAC NORM were used to quantify muscle strength before kinesio taping application (first measurement), 24 hours (second measurement) and 72 hours (third measurements after it. Third and first measurement difference was evaluated as an increase for each parameter (peak torque, average power per best <b>repetition,</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> peak torque) during eccentric contraction. The null hypothesis was not rejected for peak torque and average power per best <b>repetition</b> <b>of</b> both kinesio tape application ways but for <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> peak torque was rejected for both application methods. Kinesio tape application with both ways has statistically significant effect on <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> peak torque. On the other hand kinesio tape application do not influence peak torque or average power per best repetition. There is no statistically significant difference of both kinesio tape application methods...|$|R
