The sample is held between these two fixtures. The Instron machine has a maximum capacity up to 4 ton. The load cell is kept below the top stud. The bottom ram moves {{up and down with}} the maximum <b>ram</b> <b>stroke</b> up to ± 125 mm. The system is hydraulically operated and can operate at quasi-static and transient load conditions. The ram on which tube is kept was moved up with speed of 5 mm/min to ensure the quasi-static condition. The alignment of the sample and its fixture is assured with the machine axis. The testing was done to the maximum displacement up to 150 mm.|$|E
40|$|The {{extrusion}} {{of aluminium}} alloys involves the shaping of the product from an homogenised billet into a complex shape. In addition {{the properties of the}} extrudate are closely related to the processing parameters (temperature, stain rate, and material morphology). Since all the parameters vary throughout the <b>ram</b> <b>stroke</b> and throughout the billet the prediction of the condition of the extrudate is complex. In this study the analysis is accomplished by the use of finite element analysis coupled with sub-illodelling of the structural features. The study is extended to include the lieat-treatment process necessary for precipitation hardened alloys subsequent to the process. The author has published these results in a number of learned journals and these are given in Appendix. After a concise introduction and crirical literature review chapter 3 analyses the basic operation of the finite element package(FEM) discussing the procedures involved, the equilibrium equations and the more practical aspect of the mesh morphology and size. Finite Element analysis and material structural models have been integrated using parallel processing technology and program sub-routines. In this section the external inputs are also defined paying particular attention to the friction conditions and the constitutive equations. The thesis then proceeds to describe and analyse the integrated modelling of the process necessary to introduce the user introduction of the equations necessary to produce a comprehensive analysis of the material structural problems. This includes the cellular automata teclu-iiques. Various complex extrusion geometries are analysed and the effects of scaling considered. Development of the extrudate surface and criteria for ptedicting this important feature are coinprehebsivcly covered in chapter 5 whilst chapter 6 considers some special technologies {{such as the use of}} pockets to obtain homogenous structures. Isothermal extrusion is also included in this section. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the predictive utility of the Stroke Recovery of Activities of Daily Living and Mobility (<b>RAM)</b> Index. The <b>Stroke</b> <b>RAM</b> Index is a prognostic index that establishes {{the likelihood of a}} stroke survivor achieving a specific stage of recovery based on a set of clinical characteristics known at rehabilitation admission. The outcome predicted by the <b>Stroke</b> <b>RAM</b> Index is modified functional independence (Mod-FI), which specifies a minimum level of performance of activities of daily living and mobility. Database case records of 991 stroke patients discharged in 1998 were obtained from 8 acute inpatient rehabilitation facilities. The <b>Stroke</b> <b>RAM</b> Index was used to calculate the probability of achieving Mod-FI for each patient. Actual achievement or non-achievement of Mod-FI for each patient at discharge was determined. Logistic regression was performed with Mod-FI as outcome and the <b>Stroke</b> <b>RAM</b> Index variables as the set of predictors. To assess predictive utility, the area under the ROC curve, R 2 statistic, and sensitivity and specificity were calculated. The results show that the <b>Stroke</b> <b>RAM</b> Index predicts as well for the 1998 sample as for the original 1990 model-building sample. The area under the ROC curve was. 85 for the 1998 dataset and. 86 for the 1990 dataset. Values of sensitivity, specificity for a cutpoint of probability. 50 were similar to the values obtained for the 1990 dataset. Re-estimation of the model parameters resulted in different parameter estimates for some of the variables, but no improvement in predictive utility over the <b>Stroke</b> <b>RAM</b> Index. The stage of Mod-FI was achieved by 29 % of the patients. Of the patients who achieved Mod-FI, 96 % were discharged to the community, as opposed to 77 % of those who did not achieve it. These findings suggest that the <b>Stroke</b> <b>RAM</b> Index has utility as a prognostic tool for the prediction of a specific level of function (Mod-FI). The use of the <b>Stroke</b> <b>RAM</b> Index for estimation of prognosis for stroke patients would provide a means to make equitable comparisons of outcomes across treatment settings, improve triage into the most appropriate level of care, and to confirm equating of factors in treatment effectiveness studies. ...|$|R

The nature of drive system determines the force progression during the <b>ram's</b> <b>stroke.</b> Mechanical presses have a full tonnage rating point above BDC / Bottom Dead Center, normal full tonnage rating points are [...]187", [...]25" [...] & [...]5". Hence a mechanical press has a tonnage curve and should be operated within the press capacity limits. Link Motion mechanical is yet another option, this provides a slide slow down near BDC / bottom dead center for soft touch tooling. This link feature can improve die life and reduce reverse-snap thru tonnage for blanking operations.|$|R

Valve controlled machines usually allow a one stroke operation allowing the <b>ram</b> to <b>stroke</b> up and down when commanded. Controlled feedback systems allow the ram to be proportionally controlled to within fixed points as commanded. This allows greater control over the <b>stroke</b> of the <b>ram,</b> and increases punching rates as the ram no longer has to complete the traditional full stroke up and down but can operate within a very short window of stroke.|$|R
50|$|In 1826 Delvigne {{invented a}} new method which greatly {{simplified}} {{the use of}} rifled guns, and created a rifle known by his name. In this rifle the chamber was smaller than the bore, with which it was connected by a spherical surface equal in radius to the ball used. The powder was poured from the muzzle into the chamber, upon which the ball rested when dropped into the bore. When forced against the chamber rim by <b>ramming</b> (with three <b>strokes</b> of a heavy ram), the bullet would become deformed and flatten, so as to expand in diameter against {{the inside of the}} bore, allowing the bullet to press against the rifling grooves. When fired, the bullet would accompany the rifling and spin.|$|R
5000|$|The carabine à tige (sometimes {{called a}} [...] "stem rifle") was {{a type of}} black-powder, muzzle-loading rifle invented by Louis-Etienne de Thouvenin. The method was an {{improvement}} of the invention of another Frenchman, Henri-Gustave Delvigne. Delvigne had developed chambered carbines and rampart rifle-muskets so that when forced against the chamber rim by <b>ramming</b> (with three <b>strokes</b> of a heavy ram), the bullet would become deformed and flatten, so as to expand in diameter against {{the inside of the}} bore, allowing the bullet to press against the rifling grooves. When fired, the bullet accompanied the rifling and spun. This was an early attempt to work around one of the greatest hindrances to the use of military rifles; in order for a rifle to impart the proper spin to a projectile, the projectile must fit snugly inside the barrel to engage the rifling grooves. However, with the universally-used black powder of the day, weapons would quickly build up a thick layer of fouling when fired. After only three or four shot, a typical rifle would be impossible to load without using a mallet to force the bullet down the fouled barrel. Designing a projectile that was smaller than the bore of the barrel, to allow easy loading, but which could then be expanded to fit snugly into the bore before firing would allow for the accuracy of rifles, but without the very slow and painstaking reloading procedure necessitated by the heavy fouling.|$|R
