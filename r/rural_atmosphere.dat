Mersea Island has suffered less from the increased popularity of holidaying abroad when compared to nearby resorts such as Clacton and Southend, predominantly due to its isolated and <b>rural</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> and the continued popularity of sailing. In 2006, {{more than a thousand}} locals signed a petition against the proposed opening of a Tesco Express store on the island, expressing concern that it would take trade away from local businesses.

This area includes Anahuac as its largest community. Some of the area remains semi-rural and oriented to agriculture and commercial fishing but petroleum and chemical processing are significant industries as well. Urban development is more limited giving the area a more small-town and <b>rural</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> This area's history is somewhat distinct from the other areas around the bay as it {{is not part of}} the once crucial commercial corridor between Galveston and Houston.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 2015 the World Championships {{were moved}} to their new home, one of the cycle track bridges over the river Windrush in Langel Common, near to the Cogges Manor Farm Museum in Witney, Oxfordshire.

Car Parking is also much closer than at the original venue, which was a factor that influenced the choice of venue. As this was the first year at the new location, the organizers decided not to hold the 2015 team games.. However, the team games were restored in 2016. The move to the new venue has also allowed the event to move to June when the weather is likely to be better.|$|E

25|$|Hackney Central is {{the area}} that once would have been known as Hackney Village.

Hackney Central remained a popular resort for Londoners {{until the end of}} the Georgian era, when this suburb of London began to be completely built up.

25|$|The rate of {{patination}} conversion {{is dependent}} upon copper’s exposure to moisture, salt, and acidity from acid-forming pollutants. In marine climates, the entire patination process can take seven to nine years. In industrial environments, patina formation reaches its final stage in about fifteen to twenty-five years. In clean <b>rural</b> <b>atmospheres</b> with low concentrations of airborne sulfur dioxide, the final stage may take ten to thirty years to develop. In arid environments, a patina may not form at all if the moisture is insufficient. Where patination does take place in arid environments, it may mature to an ebony or nut brown. In all environments except the coastal areas, patination takes longer for vertical surfaces due to more rapid water runoff.|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the American Map of Atmospheric Corrosiveness (MICAT) project, 4 years of field research on atmospheric corrosion carried out in 14 countries of Ibero-America, this paper reports atmospheric copper corrosion in 21 unpolluted <b>rural</b> <b>atmospheres</b> and 45 marine atmospheres covering a broad interval of climatic conditions. High temperatures and relative humidities seem to promote greater copper corrosion in rural atmospheres: Attack rates are found in the range of 0. 1 μm/y to 2 μm/y, and corrosion product layers, generally comprising only cuprite (Cu 2 O), are discontinuous and have open structures with patinas acquiring increasingly darker colors (from salmon pink to dull brown) with exposure time. From the results obtained at marine sites, a critical deposition rate threshold is inferred for atmospheric salinity (20 mgCl-/m 2 per day), after which the atmospheric corrosion of this material is intensified.

60|$|Now, {{there is}} {{something}} to be said for the peculiar influence of pictorial symbols on men's minds. All letters, we learn, were originally pictorial and heraldic: thus the letter A is the portrait of an ox, but the portrait is now reproduced in so impressionist a manner that but little of the <b>rural</b> <b>atmosphere</b> can be absorbed by contemplating it. But as long as some pictorial and poetic quality remains in the symbol, the constant use of it must do something for the aesthetic education of those employing it. Public-houses are now almost the only shops that use the ancient signs, and the mysterious attraction which they exercise may be (by the optimistic) explained in this manner. There are taverns with names so dreamlike and exquisite that even Sir Wilfrid Lawson might waver on the threshold for a moment, suffering the poet to struggle with the moralist. So it was with the heraldic images. It is impossible to believe that the red lion of Scotland acted upon those employing it merely as a naked convenience like a number or a letter; it is impossible to believe that the Kings of Scotland would have cheerfully accepted the substitute of a pig or a frog. There are, as we say, certain real advantages in pictorial symbols, and one of them is that everything that is pictorial suggests, without naming or defining. There is a road from the eye to the heart that does not go through the intellect. Men do not quarrel about the meaning of sunsets; they never dispute that the hawthorn says the best and wittiest thing about the spring.|$|E

40|$|The {{high cost}} of ozone and {{particulate}} pollution and the regulations needed to abate them means that an ability to reliably predict the effects of emissions on air quality has significant economic value.

However, current environmental chamber technology is more than 20 years old and is not adequate for testing models under conditions representative of <b>rural</b> <b>atmospheres</b> or the cleaner urban atmospheres we expect to attain as we approach attainment of air quality standards. This proposal calls for funding design, construction and operation of a next-generation environmental chamber facility capable of obtaining the data needed for evaluating models under conditions relevant to today’s control strategy problems. The amount requested is approximately $ 3 million, with approximately half that being for design, construction and characterization of the facility, and the remainder to support its operations for four years.

40|$|The redox {{chemistry}} of Fe in fog and cloudwater {{has been investigated}} at coastal and inland locations in the Los Angeles basin, in Bakersfield California, and in Delaware Bay.

The ratio Fe(II) /Fe(total) varied between 0. 02 and 0. 55. The concentration of Fe(II) varied between 0. 1 and 5 micromole, and the concentration of total Fe varied between 2 and 27 micromole.
