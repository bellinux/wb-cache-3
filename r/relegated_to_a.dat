5|$|Armstrong's {{return was}} not well {{received}} by Contador, who asserted that he had {{earned the right to}} be a team leader and said he would consider leaving the team if he were <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> role supporting Armstrong.|$|E
5|$|The list {{includes}} clubs that are current {{members of the}} Premier League, who lost their Football League status upon promotion, and those which lost their status by other means. This includes clubs which have become defunct, merged with another club or have been <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lower position in the pyramid.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, it was {{proposed}} in 1924 that Coalhouse Fort should be re-equipped with 4-inch guns but post-war defence cuts meant that this plan was abandoned. Instead, the fort was reduced to care and maintenance status and East Tilbury Battery was decommissioned in 1930. The continuing development of artillery firepower meant that the forts and batteries further downriver took on an increased responsibility for the forward defences of the Thames. The forts on Gravesend Reach were <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> second line of defence.|$|E
60|$|But now no longer. To some half-dozen tents, fires, {{and tables}} had dwindled the picturesque festival, and these had been <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> ancient disused plaza.|$|R
50|$|Press reports {{praised the}} economy, smooth running, {{roominess}} and finish of the Fourteen. Luggage was <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> external folding bumper carrier, {{which at the}} time was not unusual.|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of the Meer and its adjacent wooded landscape {{was carried out by}} Andrew Haswell Green, to Olmsted and Vaux's specifications, from 1861, when Olmsted had been <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> advisory capacity.|$|R
5|$|In {{many modern}} Islamist movements, {{women have been}} <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{domestic}} role. Tablighi Jamaat tends to blur the boundaries of gender roles and both genders share a common behavioural model and their commitment to tabligh. The emphasis is on a common nature and responsibilities shared by both genders. Just as men redraw the gender roles when they wash and cook {{during the course of}} da'wa tours, women undertake the male responsibility of sustaining the household. Women do not play any role in the higher echelons of the movement, but their opinions are taken into due considerations.|$|E
5|$|McLeod {{signed with}} Swedish team Dalsjöfors GoIF in the Damallsvenskan for the 2011 season. Though the season ran from April 9 to October 15, McLeod didn't make an {{appearance}} for the team until August 13, following her return from national team duties at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup. She started all ten of her appearances for the team, winning one game on October 8. The team finished in last place {{in the regular season}} and were <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lower division for the following season.|$|E
5|$|Mortimer {{appeared}} at the Olympic Heroes Parade in Toronto. For the event, Paralympic athletes were given rooms at a hotel {{on the outskirts of}} Toronto while Olympic athletes were housed downtown and received gifts; at a dinner, the Paralympians were <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> different dining room. A Canadian Paralympic Committee spokesperson told The Spectator that the committee scrambled during the Paralympics to have their athletes included, and with their limited funding they could not afford the perks received by the Olympic athletes.|$|E
6000|$|In {{one of his}} autobiographic notes (1897) Mr. Gladstone {{describes}} the short and sharp parliamentary crisis in 1844 {{brought about by the}} question of the sugar duties, but this may perhaps be <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> appendix.[164] ...|$|R
2500|$|Although testing proceeded, the M.S.325 {{continued}} to be hampered by handling problems. In measuring up to other C1 competitors, the M.S.325 was <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> [...] "also-ran" [...] status and the Dewoitine D.500 became the chosen design.|$|R
60|$|Rene and Sigismund, however, took counsel together, {{and agreed}} {{that the old man}} should, instead of this fate, be <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> abbey, where he might at least have the chance of repenting of his crimes, and be kept in safe custody.|$|R
5|$|Tatuidris tatusia is {{the only}} species in Tatuidris, a {{monotypic}} genus and {{one of only two}} extant genera in the subfamily Agroecomyrmecinae. A new species, T. kapasi, was described by Lacau & Groc in 2012, but has now been <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> junior synonym under T. tatusia based on the extent of the morphological variability encountered throughout this broad geographic range. Analysis of DNA barcodes indicated a pattern of genetic isolation by distance, suggesting the presence of a single species undergoing allopatric differentiation.|$|E
5|$|Two {{drawings}} {{on paper}} in the British Museum and the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts were at times thought to be studies for the Munich Nativity. The lines of the folds in the garments closely match those of the painting, although the technical ability does not. The Paris drawing has blotches of paint indicating {{that it was a}} study piece for workshop members. The London piece is superior, but its lines are more rigid, lacking Lochner's fluidity, and so its attribution has been <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> draughtsman closely associated with Lochner.|$|E
5|$|After {{the line}} had been <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> branch line, traffic fell considerably. Another factor was car traffic, {{which did not}} exist in Flekkefjord until 1918, but {{thereafter}} became widespread. After the war, Class 20 steam locomotives were used on the line. During the 1940, several railcars of Class 87 were taken into use, and soon all passenger trains were operated using such units. From 1956 to 1966, also Class 86 units were used on the line, but the narrow profile of the tunnels made operations problematic. Class 87 remained in service until 1981, when used Class 89 units were bought from Sweden. At first, two Y7 units were brought to Norway on 23 January and taken into service on 24 February. After they proved to work well, NSB bought them for 95,000 Swedish kronor plus freight. Two more units were bought in 1986.|$|E
50|$|During the Winter War, the Finnish {{guns were}} {{successfully}} used against Soviet tanks such as T-26, T-28 and BT. However, in the Continuation War {{the gun was}} found to be ineffective against the T-34 and KV and was <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> infantry support role.|$|R
50|$|The 2007 Disc Drive Appeal was, controversially, {{handled in}} a {{different}} editorial style, {{and it was not}} featured in each programme since its launch as in previous years. Also the totaliser, previously a part of the studio set, was <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> on-screen animation/graphic.|$|R
50|$|In {{front of}} the {{fireplace}} is a painted leather firescreen made from a piece of a set of leather wallhangings which according <b>to</b> <b>a</b> local historian, the Rev. Eastmead once decorated a room at Nunnington but which were shreds <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> attic room by 1824.|$|R
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use and each has a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|E
5|$|Beyond French fries, {{the company}} has {{introduced}} several other side products {{over the course of}} its existence. Onion rings {{have been part of the}} menu for the majority of BK history. Originally made from whole, sliced onions, they were reformulated into a formed product made from onion paste in 2001 as part of a menu revamp. In the same 2001 menu revamp, the company added an onion ring-specific dipping sauce, and emphasized it again during its 99¢ BK Value Menu introduction in 2002. As part of its BK Cravers value menu introduction in 2005, the company briefly sold jalapeño poppers accompanied by a side of ranch dressing as part of its national menu. The same menu added mozzarella sticks with a side of marinara sauce; the mozzarella sticks have since been <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> regional menu item in the United States, but are sold on the national menu in Canada.|$|E
5|$|Chariot racing {{seems to}} have {{declined}} {{in the course of}} the seventh century, with the losses the Empire suffered at the hands of the Arabs and the decline of the population and economy. The Blues and Greens, deprived of any political power, were <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> purely ceremonial role. After the Nika riots, the factions grew less violent as their importance in imperial ceremony increased. In particular, the iconoclast emperor Constantine V (r. 741–775) courted the factions for their support in his campaigns against the monks. They aided the emperor in executing his prisoners and by putting on shows in which monks and nuns held hands while the crowd hissed at them. Constantine V {{seems to have}} given the factions a political role in addition to their traditionally ceremonial role. The two factions continued their activity until the imperial court was moved to Blachernae during the 12th century.|$|E

5|$|From 1972 to 1976, Remek {{studied at}} the Gagarin Air Force Academy. Upon his return to Czechoslovakia in 1976, he was {{promoted}} to captain and appointed deputy commander of his fighter regiment, after which Remek went back to Russia to train for the Soviet-led space program. Following his return from space in March 1978, Remek spent time in the Czechoslovak People's Army (ČSLA) staff as the deputy director of the Flight Research Institute in Prague. In 1986, Remek became the deputy commander of a flight division based in Čáslav. In 1988 he graduated from Voroshilov-Staff Academy of Soviet Air Force and was appointed to his highest command, as deputy of the 2nd Air Defense Division stationed in Moravia. Following the Velvet Revolution in 1989, Remek was <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> role as Director of the Museum for Aviation and Astronautics in Prague. Following his retirement from the air force in 1995, Remek represented Czech firm CZ Strakonice and joint venture CZ–Turbo-GAZ in Moscow.|$|E
5|$|HMS Campania was a {{seaplane}} {{tender and}} aircraft carrier, converted from an elderly ocean liner by the Royal Navy {{early in the}} First World War. After her conversion was completed in mid-1915 the ship spent her time conducting trials and exercises with the Grand Fleet. These revealed {{the need for a}} longer flight deck to allow larger aircraft to take off, and she was modified accordingly. Campania missed the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, but made a number of patrols with elements of the Grand Fleet. She never saw combat and was soon <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> training role because of her elderly machinery. In November 1918 Campania was anchored with the capital ships of the Grand Fleet when a sudden storm caused her anchors to drag. She hit several of the ships and the collisions punctured her hull; she slowly sank, with no loss of life.|$|E
5|$|The fifth Volume begins {{three months}} later. The family's rocketship has set {{down in a}} frozen region of a planet, where Dengo meets with members of The Last Revolution, a radical anti-war group, who wish to use Hazel as a pawn in their {{campaign}} against Landfall and Wreath. Meanwhile, as Marko and Prince Robot IV struggle to maintain their alliance while in pursuit of their kidnapped loved ones, Alana and Yuma both deal {{with the consequences of}} their use of the drug Fadeway. By the end of the arc, Dengo has turned on the revolutionaries, but is himself killed by Prince Robot IV, who is united with his son. Marko and Alana are reunited, but Hazel and Klara are <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Landfallian prison. The Brand, Gwendolyn and Sophie have acquired the elixir, but the Brand is killed in the process.|$|E

5|$|The {{governing}} bodies {{in each country}} operate league systems in a domestic season, normally comprising several divisions, in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At {{the end of a}} season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and {{one or more of the}} teams finishing at the bottom are <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lower division.|$|E
5|$|The socio-religious {{movements}} of the previous centuries, such as Lingayatism, provided momentum for flexible social norms to which women were expected to abide. By this time South Indian women had crossed most barriers and were actively involved in matters hitherto considered the monopoly of men, such as administration, business and trade, and involvement in the fine arts. Tirumalamba Devi who wrote Varadambika Parinayam and Gangadevi who wrote Madhuravijayam were among the notable women poets of the era. Early Telugu women poets like Tallapaka Timmakka and Atukuri Molla became popular during this period. The court of the Nayaks of Tanjore {{is known to have}} patronised several women poets. The Devadasi system existed, as well as legalised prostitution <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> few streets in each city. The popularity of harems amongst men of the royalty is well known from records.|$|E
5|$|Kolb {{attended}} Stephenville High School in Stephenville, Texas, {{where he}} was a three-year starter at quarterback. He moved on to the University of Houston where he earned Conference USA Offensive Most Valuable Player of the Year honors in 2006. Kolb started for two games in place of the injured Donovan McNabb during the 2009 NFL season for the Eagles, and earned NFC Player of the Week honors following his week 3 performance against the Kansas City Chiefs. Following McNabb's trade to the Washington Redskins in April 2010, Kolb became the starting quarterback for the Eagles. However, after suffering a concussion in week 1 against the Green Bay Packers, Kolb was replaced at quarterback by Michael Vick. Vick suffered a rib cartilage injury in week four and Kolb was named the starter. When Vick returned after week eight, Kolb was <b>relegated</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> backup role. Kolb was traded to the Arizona Cardinals {{prior to the start of}} the 2011 season. Kolb was released by the Cardinals on March 15, 2013.|$|E
