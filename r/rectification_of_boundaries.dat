5000|$|The {{question}} of adjusting county boundaries was revisited in 1894, when the Local Government Act {{of that year}} created urban and rural districts. It was admitted that the expected <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> <b>boundaries</b> in 1889 had not occurred and that the boundaries clauses of the Local Government Act 1888 had proved a [...] "dead letter". The 1894 Act included stronger wording that required county councils to [...] "as soon as practicable" [...] review the county boundaries {{to ensure that the}} new districts lay in a single county. Accordingly, there were many alterations over the next few years. It was only after the abolition of poor law unions in 1930 that it was finally possible to rationalise local government areas by county review orders carried out under the Local Government Act 1929.|$|E

Under the current legislative system in Queensland there are three methods available for <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> uncertain <b>boundaries.</b> The three methods available are by absolute surrender pursuant to the Land Act 1994, reconfiguration of a lot pursuant to the Integrated Planning Act 1997 and remedy through the Supreme Court.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Historically the U. S. Forest Service {{has used}} {{uncorrected}} aerial photographs to delineate proposed and past management {{activities on the}} land base it manages. Transferring a boundary from an image not planimetrically correct to a planimetrically corrected image introduces errors. Positional accuracy <b>of</b> <b>boundaries</b> affects the number of acres the Forest is accountable for managing, and the annual sale quantity (ASQ) or annual board feet targets. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a methodology that eliminated the need to transfer the boundary from an uncorrected to a corrected image. Raster and vector warping methods were evaluated with reference to positional accuracy and efficiency. Due to the rugged topography of the Siuslaw National Forest, selection of ground control points (GCPs) was an important function in the accurate transformation of images. A Vector warping method, Rubber Sheeting the ARC/INFO projective transformation for all digital GCPs, to all of the Global Position System (GPS) ground control points, provided the most accurate <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> vector <b>boundaries</b> that had been digitized or scanned from an uncontrolled low elevation photograph...|$|R
60|$|I can {{conceive}} no such Peace Congress {{as those}} that have settled up after other wars, settling up after this war. Not only has the war been enormously bigger than any other war, but it has struck deeper at the foundations {{of social and economic}} life. I doubt if we begin to realize how much of the old system is dead to-day, how much has to be remade. Since the beginnings of history there has been a credible promise of gold payments underneath our financial arrangements. It is now an incredible promise. The value of a pound note waves about while you look at it. What will happen to it when peace comes no man can tell. Nor {{what will happen to the}} mark. The rouble has gone into the Abyss. Our giddy money specialists clutch their handfuls of paper and watch it flying down the steep. Much as we may hate the Germans, some of us will have to sit down with some of the enemy to arrange a common scheme for the preservation of credit in money. And I presume that it is not proposed to end this war in a wild scramble of buyers for such food as remains in the world. There is a shortage now, a greater shortage ahead of the world, and there will be shortages of supply at the source and transport in food and all raw materials for some years to come. The Peace Congress will have to sit and organize a share-out and distribution and reorganization of these shattered supplies. It will have to Rhondda the nations. Probably, too, we shall have to deal collectively with a pestilence before we are out of the mess. Then there are such little jobs as the reconstruction of Belgium and Serbia. There are considerable <b>rectifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>boundaries</b> to be made. There are fresh states to be created, in Poland and Armenia for example. About all these smaller states, new and old, that the peace must call into being, there must be a system of guarantees of the most difficult and complicated sort.|$|R
5000|$|In Confucianism, the <b>Rectification</b> <b>of</b> Names {{means that}} [...] "things in actual fact {{should be made}} to accord with the {{implications}} attached to them by names, the prerequisites for correct living and even efficient government being that all classes of society should accord to what they ought to be". Without the <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> names, different words would have different actions. This essentially means for every action, there is a word that describes that action. The belief is that by following the <b>Rectification</b> <b>of</b> Names, one would be following the correct/right path. The <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> names also calls for a standard language in which ancient rulers could impose laws that everyone could understand to avoid confusion.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{efficiency}} of Advanced Space Borne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data in the discrimination of geological formations and the generation of geological map in the northern margin of the Tunisian desert. The nine ASTER bands covering the visible (VIS), near-infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral regions (wavelength range of 400 - 2500 nm) have been treated and analyzed. As a first step of data processing, crosstalk correction, resampling, orthorectification, atmospheric correction, and radiometric normalization have been applied to the ASTER radiance data. Then, to decrease the redundancy information in highly correlated bands, the principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied on the nine ASTER bands. The results of PCA allow the validation and the <b>rectification</b> <b>of</b> the lithological <b>boundaries</b> already published on the geologic map, and gives a new information for identifying new lithological units corresponding to superficial formations previously undiscovered. The application of a supervised classification on the principal components image using a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm shows good correlation with the reference geologic map. The overall classification accuracy is 73 % and the kappa coefficient equals to 0. 71. The processing of ASTER remote sensing data set by PCA and SVM can be employed as an effective tool for geological mapping in arid regions...|$|R

40|$|Adverse {{possession}} of part parcels permits the variation, <b>rectification,</b> and re-adjustment <b>of</b> <b>boundaries</b> with boundary definition being essential to parcel-based spatial data sets. Adverse possession and part parcel adverse possession address (and provide a possible solution to) two distinct problems {{by providing a}} single solution. It is suggested that utilizing adverse possession {{as a solution to}} boundary location discrepancy is inappropriate. Also, if a national cadastre is to become a reality, a basic requirement is a unified national law regarding land ownership. In turn this will require a unified approach to the issue of adverse {{possession of}} registered title land and particularly adverse possession of part of a land parcel. The authors view this issue as a major obstacle in achieving a unified national cadastral survey practice. This fundamental distinction requires resolution as a necessary step towards a unified approach ultimately leading to an integrated national cadastre. In this paper the authors analyse recent changes and current proposals for reform and offer the conclusion that reluctance to change is but a small obstacle to reform. However this optimistic conclusion is offset by misgivings with regard to the manner with which reforms are accomplished.
