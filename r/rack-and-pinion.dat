25|$|In 1812, Matthew Murray's {{successful}} twin-cylinder {{rack locomotive}} Salamanca first {{ran on the}} edge-railed <b>rack-and-pinion</b> Middleton Railway. Another well-known early locomotive was Puffing Billy, built 1813–14 by engineer William Hedley. It was intended {{to work on the}} Wylam Colliery near Newcastle upon Tyne. This locomotive is the oldest preserved, and is on static display in the Science Museum, London. George Stephenson built Locomotion No. 1 for the Stockton and Darlington Railway, north-east England, which was the first public steam railway in the world. In 1829, his son Robert built in Newcastle The Rocket which was entered in and won the Rainhill Trials. This success led to the company emerging as the pre-eminent builder of steam locomotives used on railways in the UK, US and much of Europe. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened a year later making exclusive use of steam power for passenger and goods trains.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, {{the first}} working steam {{locomotive}} was a <b>rack-and-pinion</b> engine, {{similar to the}} Salamanca, designed by the British locomotive pioneer John Blenkinsop. Built in June 1816 by Johann Friedrich Krigar in the Royal Berlin Iron Foundry (Königliche Eisengießerei zu Berlin), the locomotive ran on a circular track in the factory yard. It was the first locomotive to be built on the European mainland and the first steam-powered passenger service; curious onlookers could ride in the attached coaches for a fee. It is portrayed on a New Year's badge for the Royal Foundry dated 1816. Another locomotive was built using the same system in 1817. They were to be used on pit railways in Königshütte and in Luisenthal on the Saar (today part of Völklingen), but neither could be returned to working order after being dismantled, moved and reassembled. On 7 December 1835 the Adler ran {{for the first time}} between Nuremberg and Fürth on the Bavarian Ludwig Railway. It was the 118th engine from the locomotive works of Robert Stephenson and stood under patent protection.|$|E

2500|$|The Mount Washington Cog Railway is the world's first mountain-{{climbing}} {{cog railway}} (<b>rack-and-pinion</b> railway).

2500|$|The {{mechanism}} was operated {{from the}} top level. For a descent, the box was first wound into its upper position using a double <b>rack-and-pinion</b> mechanism, then drawn tightly against {{the frame of the}} opening using a ratchet mounted {{on the top of the}} wall. The outer door was then drawn up with another <b>rack-and-pinion.</b> At this point the water levels in the top pound and inside the box would have been roughly equal, but as the inner door [...] – the box door – swung outwards horizontally (like a normal single lock gate) it would not open if the outer level was to any extent higher. A small equalising cock was therefore provided. The door was opened, the boat was floated in, the doors closed and the ratchet released. Because the entering boat would displace its weight of water back into the pound, the total weight of the box was always the same and no great endeavour was needed to wind it up and down. However, the operators could release a little water into the box to assist the descent. Water pressure against the outward-opening doors kept them firmly closed and watertight.|$|E
2500|$|The Escort had {{conventional}} {{rear-wheel drive}} and a four-speed manual gearbox, or three-speed automatic transmission. The suspension consisted of MacPherson {{strut front suspension}} and a simple live axle mounted on leaf springs. The Escort was the first small Ford to use <b>rack-and-pinion</b> steering. The Mark I featured contemporary styling cues in tune with its time: a subtle Detroit-inspired [...] "Coke bottle" [...] waistline and the [...] "dogbone" [...] shaped front grille– arguably the car's main stylistic feature. Similar Coke bottle styling featured in the larger Cortina Mark III (a visually similar car was built in West Germany as the Taunus) launched in 1970.|$|E

The Celica Supra's four-wheel independent suspension was specially tuned and designed by Lotus and featured variable assisted power <b>rack-and-pinion</b> steering and MacPherson struts up front. At the rear, it had semi-trailing arm suspension with coil springs and a stabilizer bar. Braking on the Celica Supra was handled by four-wheel disc brakes.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Lamm, {{writing in}} Popular Mechanics, commented on many [...] "thoughtful touches that {{distinguish}} AMC's strikingly futuristic new Pacer".

[...] Summing up, he said that with its [...] "very modern styling, ample power and generous interior" [...] the Pacer was [...] "more car" [...] than [...] "the Mustang II or [...] "GM’s sporty compacts (Monza, Skyhawk/Starfire)", and that its performance felt [...] "strong—certainly {{on a par with}} most V8s." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1815 the Regents Canal Company built {{a double}} caisson lock [...] (or [...] "hydro-pneumatic lock") {{at the site}} of the [...] present-day Hampstead Road Lock, north London. The {{designer}} was military engineer William Congreve. Here the motivation was, principally, water supply problems but also to effect a quicker passage of vessels, as those going in opposite directions could pass in the lock. The caissons—always submerged, as at Coombe Hay—were without bottoms and were arranged so that their sides dropped into deep underwater channels formed by [...] "minor walls" [...] inside the main walls. The vertical movement of the two caissons was effected by a balance pipe ("the channel of communication") passing under the lock floor between the two caisson chambers (but with a slight upturn to reach above the water levels), so that causing an increase of water level in one caisson ("the water of compression") displaced air through the pipe, thus forcing a corresponding decrease in the water level in the other. This increased the buoyancy of the latter caisson, which accordingly rose as the first sank. A connecting underwater chain passing through rollers, while not in itself doing any work, controlled the relative positions. Boats were admitted through double gates; the inside ones on the caisson [...] "adjusted to fit close [...] to those of the outer". Congreve's patent then envisaged that having achieved [...] "absolute equipoise" [...] (neutral buoyancy) a <b>rack-and-pinion,</b> removable weights or a small winch could overcome inertia [...] and move the caissons. In a practical demonstration at Hampstead Road Congreve later elected to deploy an air compressor releasing into one caisson, estimating that one man could achieve raising and lowering in three minutes—the company's enabling act did not permit the installation of stationary steam engines. However it was found the fastest overall time was six minutes and that the effort required rendered the operator [...] "incapable of further exertion". Furthermore, as the operation of the device depended upon air pressure inside the caissons (whether the means of moving them was by varying this air pressure or otherwise) when contractor Henry Maudslay delivered them and they were found to leak air, the scheme failed. [...] In 1818, after many unsuccessful repair attempts, the company substituted conventional locks.|$|E
