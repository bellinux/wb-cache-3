5|$|DST's {{potential}} {{to save energy}} comes primarily from its effects on <b>residential</b> <b>lighting,</b> which consumes about 3.5% of electricity in the United States and Canada. Delaying the nominal time of sunset and sunrise reduces the use of artificial light {{in the evening and}} increases it in the morning. As Franklin's 1784 satire pointed out, lighting costs are reduced if the evening reduction outweighs the morning increase, as in high-latitude summer when most people wake up well after sunrise. An early goal of DST was to reduce evening usage of incandescent lighting, once a primary use of electricity. Although energy conservation remains an important goal, energy usage patterns have greatly changed since then, and recent research is limited and reports contradictory results. Electricity use is greatly affected by geography, climate, and economics, making it hard to generalize from single studies.|$|E

2500|$|Correlated color {{temperature}} (CCT) {{is a measure}} of the [...] "shade" [...] of whiteness of a light source compared with a blackbody. Typical incandescent lighting is 2700 K, which is yellowish-white. Halogen lighting is 3000 K. Fluorescent lamps are manufactured to a chosen CCT by altering the mixture of phosphors inside the tube.

50|$|A {{multifaceted}} reflector (often abbreviated MR) {{light bulb}} is a reflector housing format for halogen {{as well as}} some LED and fluorescent lamps. MR lamps were originally designed for use in slide projectors, but see use in <b>residential</b> <b>lighting</b> and retail lighting as well. They are suited to applications that require directional lighting such as track lighting, recessed ceiling lights, desk lamps, pendant fixtures, landscape lighting, retail display lighting, and bicycle headlights. MR lamps are designated by symbols such as MR16 where the diameter is represented by numerals indicating units of eighths of an inch. Common sizes for general lighting are MR16 (16/8 in) and MR11 (11/8 in), with MR20 (20/8 in) and MR8 (8/8 in) used in specialty applications. Many run on low voltage rather than mains voltage alternating current so requiring a power supply.|$|E
