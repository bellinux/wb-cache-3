Analysis of variance and correlation coefficients were calculated for data obtained from all tests. Lining fabrics were ranked in terms of fiber content for each fabric performance test. Polyester showed great resistance to abrasion, high yarn and fabric breaking strength and little dimensional change. Rayon showed great resistance to tearing and good yarn and fabric breaking strength. Cotton had good resistance to abrasion and the least yarn slippage at the seams. Acetate consistently ranked the lowest in the majority of serviceability tests.

5000|$|The first {{successful}} process {{was developed in}} 1894 by English chemist Charles Frederick Cross, and his collaborators Edward John Bevan and Clayton Beadle. They named the fiber [...] "viscose", because the reaction product of carbon disulfide and cellulose in basic conditions gave a highly viscous solution of xanthate. The first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the UK company Courtaulds Fibers in 1905. The name [...] "rayon" [...] was adopted in 1924, with [...] "viscose" [...] being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane. A similar product known as cellulose acetate was discovered in 1865. <b>Rayon</b> and <b>acetate</b> are both artificial fibers, but not truly synthetic, being made from wood. Nylon, the first synthetic fiber, was developed by Wallace Carothers, an American researcher at the chemical firm DuPont in the 1930s. It soon made its debut in the United States {{as a replacement for}} silk, {{just in time for the}} introduction of rationing during World War II. Its novel use as a material for women's stockings overshadowed more practical uses, such as a replacement for the silk in parachutes and other military uses like ropes. The first polyester fiber was introduced by John Rex Whinfield and James Tennant Dickson, British chemists working at the Calico Printers' Association, in 1941. They produced and patented the first polyester fiber which they named Terylene, also known as Dacron, equal to or surpassing nylon in toughness and resilience.

40|$|In 1934, Mr. Paolino Gerli, President of {{the newly}} formed International Silk Guild, {{concluded}} his address at the Twenty-third Annual Convention of the National Retail Dry Goods Association as follows: “A new deal, a new era…Out of a glamorous past, not a Cinderella with a time limit beauty is beckoning to you, but a beautiful Princess, awakened by Prince Charming into a new consciousness of its eternal right to be the Queen of Fabrics. ” These lofty words, delivered before an audience of American manufacturers, retailers, and wholesalers, were a call to arms for the beleaguered American silk industry. His words imparting a tone of righteousness, Mr. Gerli reflected the regal image of silk that the industry cultivated and would soon actively advance with a national promotional campaign. In that same address, he more pointedly acknowledged the woes which overtook the industry: “A new consciousness, a new pride, a new fighting spirit has been injected into the silk industry, finding its expression in a closely knit and aggressive body calling itself The International Silk Guild. ” The International Silk Guild was formed in 1933. Its purpose as stated in The American Silk and Rayon Journal, February 1934, was simply and broadly to foster trade and commerce in silk goods in the United States. The group was comprised of a diffuse range of silk textile industry and retail professionals. Raw silk importers, silk wholesalers and manufacturers, and retailers had realized by {{the early years of}} the nineteen thirties that the silk market was declining. Regenerated fibers had been encroaching upon the U. S. textile market during the nineteen twenties, and in the thirties, their production greatly increased while silk production decreased. According to the industry publication Textile Organon, February 11 1935, silk consumption in the United States generally rose from 1920 to 1929. However, from 1931 to 1933, The Rayon and Melliand Textile Monthly of January 1935, reported that production of all-silk fabric in the United States fell by 45 %. Several problems, among them the Great Depression, the over-production of raw silk by Japan, and poor quality silk fabrics culminated in the nineteen thirties in a significant decline in silk demand and consumption in the United States. In response to this decline, professionals in the U. S. silk industry organized, forming The International Silk Guild, a group which represented the interests of raw silk importers, silk wholesalers, and silk manufacturers. The group adopted an aggressive stance, attempting, through an active marketing campaign, to increase sales of silk in the United States. At the same time silk production was decreasing, production of <b>rayon</b> and <b>acetate</b> was increasing. Between 1931 and 1933, production of all-rayon fabric increased by 150 %. Although the problems facing the silk industry were varied and complex, the industry’s professionals blamed their woes upon the production rayon. American Silk and Rayon Journal, December, 1934, states, “The chief source of trouble in the loss of markets of the silk manufacturers is the rayon industry. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{temporary}} or supplementary thread {{has been}} {{employed as a}} supportive structure {{in the manufacture of}} utilitarian and decorative woven textiles for over a hundred years. First developed by wool cleaners and finishers during the mid 19 th century, the technique has been repeatedly employed to aid innovative yarn and fabric development by some of the textile industry’s leading engineers. The devoré technique, also known as burn out, developed from this temporary thread process during the late 1880 s. The popularity of devoré with textiles engineers reached its peak in the 1920 s when a period of high decoration coincided with innovation in new artificial fibers such as viscose <b>rayon</b> and cellulose <b>acetate.</b> The post war resurgence in textile engineering and fashion designing during the Art Deco period engendered numerous highly decorative devoré and temporary thread processes that utilized metallic, rayon, wire and latex threads. Fabric Innovation from Established Processes The devoré procedure of chemically removing single or multiple fibers from a constructed fabric {{can be traced to the}} wool cleaning industries of the mid to late 19 th century and the carbonizing treatment, employed to remove plant debris trapped within wool fleece. By treating wool in sulphuric acid solution, contaminating plant matter was reduced to dust when the wool was heated. The earliest forms of woven devoré follow the same principle of destruction, only the plant matter was replaced with cotton threads constructed within a wool woven textile. Initially it was American and European yarn manufacturers who recognised the economic potential of the temporary thread technique. Delicate wool fibers were twisted (spun) with a cotton thread which acted as a secure rigid guide during fabric construction. The earliest forms of fabric patterning using carbonizing treatments favored localised thread removal using printed carbonising pastes, whereupon cotton or linen threads previously twisted with wool or silk threads, and used for the warp or weft (or both), were burnt away revealing delicate lace-like open work effects...|$|R
