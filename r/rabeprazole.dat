25|$|In {{the year}} 1975, {{timoprazole}} {{was found to}} inhibit acid secretion irrespective of stimulus, extracellular or intracellular. Studies on timoprazole revealed enlargement of the thyroid gland due to inhibition of iodine uptake as well as atrophy of the thymus gland. A literature search showed that some substituted mercapto-benzimidazoles {{had no effect on}} iodine uptake and introduction of such substituents into timoprazole resulted in an elimination of the toxic effects, without reducing the antisecretory effect. A derivative of timoprazole, omeprazole, was discovered in 1979, and was the first of a new class of drug that control acid secretion in the stomach, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Addition of 5-methoxy-substitution to the benzimidazole moiety of omeprazole was also made and gave the compound much more stability at neutral pH. In 1980, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application was filed and omeprazole was taken into Phase III human trials in 1982. A new approach for the treatment of acid-related diseases was introduced, and omeprazole was quickly shown to be clinically superior to the histamine H2 receptor antagonists, and was launched in 1988 as Losec in Europe, and in 1990 as Prilosec in the United States. In 1996, Losec became the world's biggest ever selling pharmaceutical, and by 2004 over 800 million patients had been treated with the drug worldwide. During the 1980s, about 40 other companies entered the PPIs area, but few achieved market success: Takeda with lansoprazole, Byk Gulden (now Nycomed) with pantoprazole, and Eisai with <b>rabeprazole,</b> all of which were analogues of omeprazole.|$|E

An overall endoscopic healing rate of 66.7% after 8 weeks and 80% after 12 weeks of drug administration was achieved with troxipide (100 mg t.i.d. (three times a day)). In patients with duodenal ulcers, troxipide showed endoscopic healing rate of 53.3% and 73% at 8 weeks and 12 weeks respectively. At the end of the treatment, an overall improvement of 86.6% and 93.3% was achieved in patients with gastric ulcer and duodenal ulcer respectively.In patients with acute gastritis and acute gastric mucosal lesions, an overall amelioration rate of 82.9% has been observed with troxipide. In a comparative study evaluating the efficacy of troxipide (100 mg t.i.d.) with Ranitidine (150 mg b.i.d.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the role of <b>rabeprazole</b> on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of metformin. The in vitro inhibition assays on metformin transport were carried out and showed that the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of <b>rabeprazole</b> on OCT 2 -mediated metformin transport was 26. 0  μM, whereas the IC 50 on MATE 1 -mediated metformin transport inhibition was 4. 6  μM. Fifteen healthy Chinese male volunteers were enrolled and given two different doses of metformin plus the co-administration of placebo or <b>rabeprazole.</b> Plasma concentrations of metformin were measured up to 12  h after the second dose. The glucose-lowering effects and the variation of insulin concentrations were evaluated during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The AUC 0 – 12 of metformin plus <b>rabeprazole</b> were 28, 276  ±  5187  ng/ml·h, which was significantly higher than AUC 0 – 12 of metformin plus placebo (24, 691  ±  3129  ng/ml·h). Thus, <b>rabeprazole</b> can modestly influence the PK of metformin, suggesting the precaution of using the two drugs together. In OGTTs, <b>rabeprazole</b> decreased the values of AUCinsulin and the maximum insulin concentration.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), mostly omeprazole, interact with clopidogrel efficacy by inhibiting the formation of its active metabolite via CYP 2 C 19 inhibition. Whether this occurs with all PPIs is a matter of debate. As <b>rabeprazole</b> is a less potent CYP 2 C 19 inhibitor than other PPIs, we studied the interaction between <b>rabeprazole</b> and the antiplatelet actions and pharmacokinetics of clopidogrel. AIM: To demonstrate the non-inferiority of <b>rabeprazole</b> over placebo using change in platelet reactivity index (PRI; vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein [VASP] assay) in a predefined population of good clopidogrel responders. Omeprazole was used as the positive control. METHODS: In this randomized three-period crossover study in healthy volunteers, 36  healthy men received clopidogrel (75 mg/day for 7  days) with placebo, omeprazole (20 mg/day) or <b>rabeprazole</b> (20 mg/day). Clopidogrel antiplatelet effects and disposition kinetics were assessed on day  7 of combination therapy. Non-inferiority threshold was predefined as an upper limit of the 90 % confidence interval for the difference in change in PRI between placebo and <b>rabeprazole</b> of 30 %), the clopidogrel antiplatelet effect remained non-inferior to placebo during <b>rabeprazole</b> (difference 3. 4 % [- 1. 7; 8. 5]) but not omeprazole (difference 7. 5 % [2. 5; 12. 6]) co-administration.

Six healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. The study was a single-center, open-label, multiple-dose, mass-balance study. Each subject received a single 20 mg dose of <b>rabeprazole</b> tablet for 7 days followed by the administration of 20 mg of [14 C] <b>rabeprazole</b> as an oral solution after an overnight fast on Day 8. After oral dosing of [14 C] <b>rabeprazole,</b> the mean Cmax of total radioactivity was 1, 080 +/- 215 ng equivalent/ml with 0. 33 +/- 0. 13 hours of the mean tmax. The apparent elimination half-life of total [14 C] radioactivity was 12. 6 +/- 3. 4 hours. The total [14 C] recovery in urine and feces was 99. 8 +/- 0. 7 % by 168 hours after oral administration of [14 C] <b>rabeprazole,</b> and mean cumulative [14 C] radioactivity excreted in urine was 90. 0 +/- 1. 7 % by 168 hours and 79. 8 +/- 2. 5 % of the radioactivity was excreted in urine within 24 hours. Excretion via feces added to the total by 9. 8 %. The major radioactive component in the early plasma samples was <b>rabeprazole,</b> however the thioether and thioether carboxylic acid metabolites were the main radioactive components in the later plasma sample. These results support the previous finding that the substantial contribution of the non-enzymatic thioether pathway minimizes the effect of CYP 2 C 19 polymorphism on the inter-individual variation ofplasma clearance of <b>rabeprazole</b> compared with other PPIs. Low levels of the sulfone metabolite were detected only in early plasma samples. No <b>rabeprazole</b> was detected in any urine and feces samples. The main radioactive components in urine were thioether carboxylic acid and mercapturic acid conjugate metabolites, and in the feces, the thioether carboxylic acid metabolite. The administration of [14 C] <b>rabeprazole</b> was safe as evidenced by the lack of serious adverse events and the fact that all observed events were mild in intensity.
