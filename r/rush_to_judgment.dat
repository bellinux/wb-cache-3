25|$|Lane {{published}} {{an indictment of}} the Warren Commission, entitled <b>Rush</b> <b>to</b> <b>Judgment,</b> using these interviews as well as evidence from the 26 volumes of the Commission's report. Despite {{the fact that the}} majority of Mark Lane's material for his book came from the Warren Report itself, as well as from interviews with those who were at the scene, sixteen publishers canceled contracts before <b>Rush</b> <b>to</b> <b>Judgment</b> was published. The book became a number one best seller and spent 29 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list. The book criticizes in detail the work and conclusions of the Warren Commission and {{remains one of the most}} remarkable books about the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. It was adapted into a documentary film in 1966.|$|E
25|$|Mark Lane (February 24, 1927 – May 10, 2016) was an American attorney, New York state legislator, {{civil rights}} activist, and Vietnam war-crimes investigator. He {{is best known}} as a leading researcher, author, and {{conspiracy}} theorist on the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy. From his 1966 number-one bestselling critique of the Warren Commission, <b>Rush</b> <b>to</b> <b>Judgment,</b> to Last Word: My Indictment of the CIA in the Murder of JFK, published in 2011, Lane wrote at least four major works on the JFK assassination and no fewer than ten books overall.|$|E

25|$|On December 5, 1967, while Bolden {{was serving}} his {{sentence}} at the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri, attorneys John Hosmer (Bolden's lawyer), Mark Lane (author of <b>Rush</b> <b>to</b> <b>Judgment),</b> and Richard V. Burnes (assistant to Jim Garrison) {{held a news}} conference in which they stated they had received information from Bolden that the Secret Service was aware of a prior assassination attempt on Kennedy in Chicago. According to the attorneys, the Secret Service had been informed that an attempt on the President's life would be made in Chicago which resulted in the cancellation of his visit due to safety concerns. They stated that Bolden said he and other agents had shadowed a suspect due to the report.|$|E
25|$|As leading {{suspects}} were rounded {{up by the}} militia ordered by Intendant/Mayor James Hamilton, the Charleston City Council voted to authorize a Court of Magistrates and Freeholders to evaluate suspects and determine crimes. Tensions in the city were at a height, and some residents had doubts about actions taken during the widespread fears and quick <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> <b>judgment.</b> Soon after the Court began its sessions, in secret and promising secrecy to all witnesses, Supreme Court Justice William Johnson published {{an article in the}} local paper recounting an incident of a feared insurrection of 1811. He noted that a slave was mistakenly executed in the case, hoping to suggest caution in the Vesey affair. He was well respected, having been appointed as Justice by President Thomas Jefferson in 1804. But his article appeared to produce a defensive reaction, with white residents defending the Court and the militancy of city forces.|$|E

5000|$|According to the JTA, Venezuelan {{government}} sources, and Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, Jewish {{leaders in}} Venezuela said the quote omitted {{the reference to}} Bolívar, stated that Chávez was referring to Jews, and denounced the remarks as anti-Semitic by way of his allusions to wealth. According to an article published at Forward.com, Venezuelan Jewish community leaders accused the Simon Wiesenthal Center of <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> <b>judgment</b> with the anti-Semitic remarks, saying that Chávez's comments had {{been taken out of}} context, and that he was actually referring to [...] "gentile business elites" [...] or the [...] "white oligarchy that has dominated the region since the colonial era". However, according to the American-Israeli Cooperative Enterprise in their Jewish Virtual Library, the Venezuelan Jewish communities and organizations refrained from criticizing Chavez's statements so they would not draw negative publicity and for security reasons.|$|R
40|$|We are in {{a similar}} {{situation}} today with methamphetamine as we were 20 years ago during the cocaine epidemic. During that time, there was legitimate concern for the welfare of children exposed to cocaine in the womb. But based on insufficient and inaccurate information, society <b>rushed</b> <b>to</b> <b>judgment</b> – an over-reaction that had negative consequences for women and children (1). Many women were prosecuted and children were removed from their birth mothers. Families split up. As a result, by the mid 1990 s, the number of children in foster care reached an all-time high of over 500, 000. Many of these children suffered emotional problems from multiple foster care placements. This lead to the 1997 passage of the Adoption and Safe Families Act, or ASFA, requiring permanent placement of a child within 12 months of being removed from his or her birth mother. Unfortunately, ASFA has been counterproductive for families who could easily be reunited if they had access to appropriate drug treatment and/or if they were not in jail for drug related offenses. After 20 years of research, we learned that the effects of cocaine are not nearly as severe as initially feared (2). In fact, when factors like other drugs and poverty ar...|$|R
40|$|Political {{action on}} climate change has been slow enough to cause despair in {{a section of the}} {{scientific}} community, leading it to advocate research and development of technologies for “the deliberate manipulation of planetary systems to counteract anthropogenic climate change”. At this stage such ideas are simply proposals. However they have already been attacked by some social scientists as inherently undemocratic. This paper suggests that such claims are at best premature and notes that conventional mitigation policies have potential to pose significant problems for democracy but have not attracted the same early condemnation. We suggest that the <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> negative <b>judgment</b> on geoengineering might stem from anxieties that geoengineering poses the possibility of a realignment of political cultures around the issue of climate change...|$|R
500|$|Some media commentators, such as Howard Kurtz and Toby Harnden, criticized {{what they}} {{perceived}} as a <b>rush</b> <b>to</b> <b>judgment</b> about the shooter's motivation, disputing suggestions that the shooting {{was the result of}} the Tea Party movement or anything in connection to Palin. Paul Krugman wrote an op-ed piece arguing that political rhetoric had become toxic. With renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after the shooting, Keith Olbermann said, [...] "Violence, or the threat of violence, has no place in our Democracy, and I apologize for and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence." [...] Jon Stewart stated that he did not know whether or not the political environment contributed to the shooting, but, [...] "For all the hyperbole and vitriol that's become a part of our political process—when the reality of that rhetoric, when actions match the disturbing nature of words, we haven't lost our capacity to be horrified. ... Maybe it helps us to remember to match our rhetoric with reality more often." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the 1969 {{trial of}} Clay Shaw, a {{businessman}} from New Orleans, for conspiracy {{in connection with}} the assassination, a copy of the film several generations from the original was subpoenaed from Time Inc. in 1967 by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison for use at Shaw's grand jury hearing. Garrison unsuccessfully subpoenaed the original film in 1968. The courtroom showings of Garrison's copy in 1969 were the first time it had been shown in public as a film. [...] Noted conspiracy theorist Mark Lane, author of <b>Rush</b> <b>to</b> <b>Judgment,</b> was in New Orleans at the time to assist Garrison in his investigation. Lane borrowed Garrison's copy of the Zapruder film and had several copies printed at a local lab. [...] These low quality copies began circulating among assassination researchers and were known to many journalists as well. The underground circulation of these copies and the secret screenings to a select few who had the opportunity to see them added an additional aura of mystery to the film, enhancing the idea that there was a secret to be found in it that was being kept hidden from the general public.|$|E
