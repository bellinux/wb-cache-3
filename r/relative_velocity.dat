The resulting <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white dwarf star. The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E

40|$|We {{discuss some}} aspects about the {{computation}} of kinematic, spectroscopic, Fermi and astrometric <b>relative</b> <b>velocities</b> that are geometrically defined in general relativity. Mainly, we state that kinematic and spectroscopic <b>relative</b> <b>velocities</b> only {{depend on the}} 4 -velocities of the observer and the test particle, unlike Fermi and astrometric <b>relative</b> <b>velocities,</b> that also depend on the acceleration of the observer and the corresponding relative position of the test particle, but only at the event of observation and not around it, {{as it would be}} deduced, in principle, from the definition of these velocities. Finally, we propose an open problem in general relativity that consists on finding intrinsic ex-pressions for Fermi and astrometric <b>relative</b> <b>velocities</b> avoiding terms that involve the evolution of the relative position of the test particle. For this purpose, the proofs given in this paper can serve as inspiration. ...|$|R

5|$|Besides {{the galactic}} tide, the main trigger for sending comets {{into the inner}} Solar System {{is thought to be}} {{interaction}} between the Sun's Oort cloud and the gravitational fields of nearby stars or giant molecular clouds. The orbit of the Sun through the plane of the Milky Way sometimes brings it in relatively close proximity to other stellar systems. For example, it is hypothesized that 70thousand years ago, perhaps Scholz's star passed through the outer Oort cloud (although its low mass and high <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> limited its effect). During the next 10million years the known star with the greatest possibility of perturbing the Oort cloud is Gliese 710. This process could also scatter Oort cloud objects out of the ecliptic plane, potentially also explaining its spherical distribution.|$|E
5|$|Special {{relativity}} {{has many}} counterintuitive and experimentally verified implications. These include the equivalence of mass and energy , length contraction (moving objects shorten), and time dilation (moving clocks run more slowly). The factorγ by which lengths contract and times dilate {{is known as}} the Lorentz factor and is given by , where v is the speed of the object. The difference of γ from 1 is negligible for speeds much slower thanc, such as most everyday speeds—in which case special relativity is closely approximated by Galilean relativity—but it increases at relativistic speeds and diverges to infinity as v approaches c. For example, a time dilation factor of γ=2 occurs at a <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> of 86.6% of the speed of light (v=.866c). Similarly, a time dilation factor of γ=10 occurs at v=99.5%c.|$|E
5|$|This {{technology}} {{is widely used}} in confirming venous pathology diagnoses. The imaging capability needed, was made possible with the developments of Doppler and color Doppler. Doppler measurements using Doppler effect can show {{the direction of the}} blood flow and its <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> and color Doppler is the provision of color to help interpret the image, showing for example, the blood flow towards the probe in one color and that flowing away another. Whilst the equipment itself is costly, the procedure is not. Apart from the scanner, different probes are required according to the depth to be studied. A gel is used with the probe to make a good acoustic impedance contact. The training and expertise of the examiner is important because of the many technical complications that can present. Venous anatomy for example, is not constant, for example a patient's vein layout of the right limb is not identical to that of the left limb.|$|E

5|$|Halley's {{orbital period}} has varied between 74–79 years since 240 BC. Its {{orbit around the}} Sun is highly elliptical, with an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.967 (with 0 being a circle and 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, {{the point in the}} comet's orbit when it is nearest the Sun, is just 0.6 AU. This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from the Sun, is 35 AU (roughly the distance of Pluto). Unusual for an object in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18° to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. (Because it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162°). Due to the retrograde orbit, it {{has one of the highest}} velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> of 70.56km/s (157,838mph or 254,016km/h). Because its orbit comes close to Earth's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October. Halley is the parent body to the Orionids. Observations conducted around the time of Halley's appearance in 1986 suggested that the comet could additionally perturb the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, although it might not be the parent of that shower.|$|E

25|$|A {{constraint}} condition implies a restriction in the kinematical {{degrees of freedom}} {{of one or more}} bodies. The classical constraint is usually an algebraic equation that defines the relative translation or rotation between two bodies. There are furthermore possibilities to constrain the <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> between two bodies or a body and the ground. This is for example the case of a rolling disc, where the point of the disc that contacts the ground has always zero <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> with respect to the ground. In the case that the velocity {{constraint condition}} cannot be integrated in time in order to form a position constraint, it is called non-holonomic. This is the case for the general rolling constraint.|$|E

25|$|Single rotor {{helicopters}} {{are limited}} in forward speed {{by a combination of}} sonic tip speed and retreating blade stall. As the advance ratio increases, the <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> experienced by the retreating blade decreases so that the tip of the blade experiences zero velocity at an advance ratio of one. Helicopter rotors pitch the retreating blade to a higher angle of attack to maintain lift as the <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> decreases. At a sufficiently high advance ratio, the blade will reach the stalling angle of attack and experience retreating blade stall. Specially designed airfoils can increase the operating advance ratio by utilizing high lift coefficient airfoils.

25|$|Aside from countless uses in {{fundamental}} mathematics, a Euclidean {{model of the}} physical space {{can be used to}} solve many practical problems with sufficient precision. Two usual approaches are a fixed, or stationary reference frame (i.e. the description of a motion of objects as their positions that change continuously with time), and the use of Galilean space-time symmetry (such as in Newtonian mechanics). To both of them the modern Euclidean geometry provides a convenient formalism; for example, the space of Galilean velocities is itself a Euclidean space (see <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> for details).|$|E
25|$|Transformations {{describing}} {{relative motion}} with constant (uniform) velocity and without {{rotation of the}} space coordinate axes are called boosts, and the <b>relative</b> <b>velocity</b> between the frames is the parameter of the transformation. The other basic type of Lorentz transformations is rotations in the spatial coordinates only, these are also inertial frames {{since there is no}} relative motion, the frames are simply tilted (and not continuously rotating), and in this case quantities defining the rotation are the parameters of the transformation (e.g., axis–angle representation, or Euler angles, etc.). A combination of a rotation and boost is a homogeneous transformation, which transforms the origin back to the origin.|$|E
