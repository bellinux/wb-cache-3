40|$|Abstract. <b>Raster</b> <b>maps</b> are an {{important}} source of road information. Because of the overlapping map features (e. g., roads and text labels) and the varying image quality, extracting road vector data from <b>raster</b> <b>maps</b> usually requires significant user input to achieve accurate results. In this paper, we present an accurate road vectorization technique that minimizes user input by combining our previous work on extracting road pixels and road-intersection templates to extract accurate road vector data from <b>raster</b> <b>maps.</b> Our approach enables GIS applications to exploit the road information in <b>raster</b> <b>maps</b> for the areas where the road vector data are otherwise not easily accessible, such as the countries of the Middle East. We show that our approach requires minimal user input and achieves an average of 93. 2 % completeness and 95. 6 % correctness in an experiment using <b>raster</b> <b>maps</b> from various sources.

40|$|<b>Raster</b> <b>maps</b> {{are widely}} {{available}} and contain useful geographic features such as labels and road lines. To extract the geographic features, most research work relies on a manual step to first extract the foreground pixels from the maps using the distinctive colors or grayscale intensities of the pixels. This strategy requires user interaction for each map to select a set of thresholds. In this paper, we present a map classification technique that uses an image comparison feature called the luminance-boundary histogram and a nearest-neighbor classifier to identify <b>raster</b> <b>maps</b> with similar grayscale intensity usage. We can then apply previously learned thresholds to separate the foreground pixels from the <b>raster</b> <b>maps</b> that are classified in the same group instead of manually examining each map. We show that the luminance-boundary histogram achieves 95 % accuracy in our map classification experiment compared to 13. 33 %, 86. 67 %, and 88. 33 % using three traditional image comparison features.

40|$|Abstract Text labels in maps provide {{valuable}} geographic information by associating place names with locations. This information from historical maps {{is especially important}} since historical maps are very often {{the only source of}} past information about the earth. Recog-nizing the text labels is challenging because heterogeneous <b>raster</b> <b>maps</b> have varying image quality and complex map contents. In addition, the labels within a map do not follow a fixed orientation and can have various font types and sizes. Previous approaches typically handle a specific type of map or require intensive manual work. This paper presents a gen-eral approach that requires a small amount of user effort to semi-automatically recognize text labels in heterogeneous <b>raster</b> <b>maps.</b> Our approach exploits a few examples of text areas to extract text pixels and employs cartographic labeling principles to locate individ-ual text labels. Each text label is then rotated automatically to horizontal and processed by conventional OCR software for character recognition. We compared our approach to a state-of-art commercial OCR product using 15 <b>raster</b> <b>maps</b> from 10 sources. Our evaluation shows that our approach enabled the commercial OCR product to handle <b>raster</b> <b>maps</b> and together produced significant higher text recognition accuracy than using the commercial OCR alone...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Raster</b> <b>maps</b> contain rich road information, {{such as the}} {{topology}} {{and names}} of roads, but this information is “locked ” in images and inaccessible in a geographic information system (GIS). Previous approaches for road extraction from <b>raster</b> <b>maps</b> typically handle this problem as raster-to-vector conversion and hence the extracted road vector data are line segments without the knowledge of road names and where a road starts and ends. This paper presents a technique that builds on the results from our previous road vectorization and text recognition work to generate named road vector data from <b>raster</b> <b>maps.</b> This technique first segments road vectorization results using road intersections to determine the lines that represent individual roads in the map. Then the technique exploits spatial relationships between roads and recognized text labels to generate road names for individual road segments. We implemented this approach in our map processing system, called Strabo, and demonstrate that the system generates accurate named road vector data on example maps with 92. 83 % accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Map overlay and {{satellite}} image zooming makes map reading more convenient. These techniques are the building block for various analysis operations in GIS. Map overlay is performed by layering maps {{in the form}} of shapefiles over a <b>raster</b> <b>map.</b> In this paper map overlay is performed using uniform grid method. The shapefiles are placed one over the other using the coordinate information attached with these files. Satellite image (<b>Raster</b> <b>Map)</b> zooming enable users to view the inner details of the map which will provide a real world view. The proposed system achieves this by first tiling the image and then generating an image pyramid with these tiles. While zooming, the system loads only tiles of the required portion of the image instead of loading the entire image. Keywords—Overlay, Grid, Pyramid, Tile. I...|$|E
