25|$|They {{are located}} at the {{intersection}} of the roads that lead to the five gates of the old <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> (mura dei torresotti). It was {{located at the}} site of the early medieval Gate to the Via Emilia, the Porta Ravennate, now remembered by the name of the adjacent Piazza di Porta Ravegnana. The taller tower is called the Asinelli while the smaller but more leaning tower is called the Garisenda.|$|E
2500|$|Crosskirk Broch was a {{fortification}} {{near the}} present day hamlet of Crosskirk near Thurso, Caithness, Scotland. [...] After thorough archaeological exploration it was destroyed in 1972 since the site had become unsafe due to sea erosion. [...] The site was unusual in having a broch, a large circular fortification, built within an older promontory fortification with a <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> and blockhouse.|$|E
2500|$|Further {{down the}} slopes {{to the north}} of the summit lies Rathmichael where the ruins of a church and round tower are found {{enclosed}} within the remains of what would once have been one of the largest ringforts in Ireland. The church dates from Norman times but the presence of the round tower and ringfort indicates that the site dates back to early Christian times. Its dedication is believed to be to a saint called MacTail (later corrupted as [...] "Michael") which would date the foundation of the monastery and church to the mid-seventh century. The site also lies close to the route of the pilgrimage route from St. Mary's Church, Dublin to Glendalough. The entrance to the ringfort was [...] in width and had an arched gateway. The <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> and mound is approximately [...] in diameter and its size suggests the site was the base for an important chieftain. Within the enclosure would have lain a small quadrangular church and a number of monastic huts.|$|E

5000|$|Shell {{works are}} large and complex assemblages of shell found in {{southwest}} Florida. Shell works include mounds and other deposits, with features described as borrow pits, canals, causeways, cisterns, crescents, sunken plazas, ponds, ramps, raised platforms, ridges, <b>rings,</b> <b>walls,</b> and [...] "water courts". The largest shell works were constructed during the Woodland period in southwest Florida, from Charlotte Harbor to the Ten Thousand Islands, including Estero Bay.|$|R
50|$|In {{general the}} Zwinger walls were {{markedly}} lower and less thick {{that the actual}} <b>ring</b> <b>walls.</b> Often only a parapet wall was erected around the intended killing ground of the Zwinger. Occasionally a covered or open wall walk {{was built on the}} inside of the wall, as at Trausnitz Castle in Landshut. Even underground wall walks with embrasures for hand guns may be seen, for example, at Hochhaus Castle near Nördlingen.|$|R
50|$|The <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> {{around the}} main castle {{originally}} had a residential building {{along the north}} side and still shows signs of windows and privies. In the 13th century a large, square, four-story tower was added {{on the west side}} of the <b>ring</b> <b>wall.</b> East of the main <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> was another, larger <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> which may have included a gate house. Very little of this outer wall remains and it is unclear how it connected to the main castle.|$|E
50|$|The {{tower was}} {{surrounded}} by a stone <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> that was about 3 m larger than the tower. The rectangular outer bailey was to the south-west of the round tower. It was defended by steep slopes and a ditch. Very little of the <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> or outer bailey still remain.|$|E
50|$|A <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> {{runs around}} the islet, with a two-room {{blockhouse}} forming the defense opposite the causeway. The <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> {{seems to have}} been built separately from the main structure. The blockhouse forms part of the ringwork, but is not bonded into the <b>ring</b> <b>wall.</b> The weaknesses in the defense of this and related structures could be explained by additional defenses of wood and thorn branches that have disappeared without leaving any trace. Another possibility is that the defenses were mainly symbolic, and perhaps played a part in warfare that was conducted according to formal rituals.|$|E
50|$|The hill castle {{is first}} {{recorded}} in 1217 as castrum in Munjoje by Archbishop Engelbert I of Cologne. It was expanded {{in the middle}} of the 14th century into a fortress for the counts of Jülich and equipped with mighty <b>ring</b> <b>walls</b> and wall walks. In 1543 troops of Emperor Charles V besieged the site with heavy guns, captured it and plundered it together with the town of Monschau.|$|R
50|$|When the Frisians colonised {{the area}} of modern Nordfriesland during the 7th century, their first {{settlements}} were erected on Föhr, according to archaeological findings. The formerly sparsely inhabited island witnessed a steep rise of population. A rather large amount of jewellery originating from Scandinavia that was found in graves of the time points out a vivid connection to northern Europe. From {{the age of the}} Vikings, several <b>ring</b> <b>walls,</b> the Lembecksburg among them, are preserved.|$|R

50|$|The <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> {{was added}} {{in either the}} 13th or 14th centuries. Much of the {{southern}} wall and gate are from the original <b>ring</b> <b>wall.</b> During the 15th century a palas was built along the north wall, incorporating the old tower. The old north-west corner of the <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> was demolished and a two story half-timbered residence was added. A gatehouse was first built near the south-east corner in 1485/86, though it was later replaced. The eastern buildings, the entrance hall and a chapel were added in 1786/87. The old gatehouse was replaced with another that has the date 1741 carved above the entrance.|$|E
50|$|The complex {{consists}} of the main castle with its tower, residential tract and secondary buildings surrounded by a <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> and a southern outer ward which is surrounded by another <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> in varying thickness. The two parts were connected by the gateway, through which a vaulted passage led into {{the courtyard of the}} main castle. Numerous masonry joints and differences in the wall structure indicate that the building must have taken place in several stages. The oldest part is part of the <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> on the southeast which may date to before 1200. The main tower to the north may be from before 1200 or the early 13th century. In the early 13th century, the <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> and parts of the southern residential tract were added. The bergfried still has five floors with a high entrance on the fourth floor on the south side. Since the masonry of the tower is not connected to the surrounding walls, these must be more recent.|$|E
40|$|We have {{observed}} spontaneous fluxoid generation in thin film rings of the amorphous superconductor Mo 3 Si, cooled through the normal-superconducting transition, {{as a function}} of quench rate and externally applied magnetic field, using a variable sample temperature scanning SQUID microscope. Our results can be explained using a model of freeze-out of thermally activated fluxoids, mediated by the transport of bulk vortices across the <b>ring</b> <b>walls.</b> This mechanism is complementary to a mechanism proposed by Kibble and Zurek, which only relies on causality to produce a freeze-out of order parameter fluctuation...|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} when the church was built, a small medieval town stood on the hill. It was {{originally}} fortified by Snare's castle but this was replaced in the 14th century by Kalundborg Castle, now in ruins, with its <b>ring</b> <b>walls</b> and ditches. Much of this has now disappeared but the old churchyard walls are still intact. Two brick houses from 1500 form part of the boundary walls and a few brick houses near the church are evidence of the prosperity the town enjoyed in the 15th century.|$|R
50|$|Construction of the {{fortress}} began in 1077 under Archbishop Gebhard von Helfenstein. The original design was a basic bailey {{with a wooden}} wall. In the Holy Roman Empire, the archbishops of Salzburg were already powerful political figures and they expanded the castle to protect their interests. Gebhard's conflict with Emperor Henry IV during the Investiture Controversy influenced {{the expansion of the}} castle, with the Archbishop taking the side of Pope Gregory VII and the German anti-king Rudolf of Rheinfelden. The castle was gradually expanded during the following centuries. The <b>ring</b> <b>walls</b> and towers were built in 1462 under Prince-Archbishop Burkhard II von Weißpriach.|$|R

50|$|In {{the east}} {{corner of the}} inner {{courtyard}} lies the original well, drilled vertically through 62 m of bedrock. The castle keep {{is surrounded by a}} <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> which encloses the bailey. A further forecourt is enclosed by another <b>ring</b> <b>wall.</b> At the south side of this <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> was the entrance to the estate. On 18 October 1356, a powerful earthquake shook the Rhine rift; the donjon collapsed onto the eastern and southeastern buildings. Beginning about 1370, large-scale reconstruction and expansion of the castle took place. The donjon was demolished, the entrance to the keep relocated and the northern shield wall was closed and raised. The entrance to the castle is now in the southwest corner, where it is protected by the south tower and an inner bailey.|$|E
5000|$|Today Vordingborg Castle is a ruin, {{although}} {{parts of}} the fourteenth century <b>ring</b> <b>walls</b> remain. The only fully preserved part of the castle, the 26 meter tall Goose Tower (Gåsetårnet), is {{the symbol of the}} city. The name comes from the golden goose that perches on top of the tower's spire. Although legend has it that Valdemar Atterdag used the symbol to taunt the Hanseatic League, the truth is the goose was first erected in 1871. The tower was transferred into the national trust on December 24, 1808, and was thus the first, protected historic monument in Denmark.|$|R

50|$|The parish church St. Michael {{is worth}} seeing (literature - in German - is {{referenced}} below). Three of the once four gate lodges are still present. They {{were part of}} the fortification (a <b>ring</b> of <b>walls</b> surrounding the town centre).|$|R
5000|$|... ==Castle site== The castle {{was built}} on a 50 m long, narrow rocky ridge between the villages of St. Joseph and Tavanasa. The <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> follows {{the edge of the}} ridge, making it a rough oval {{oriented}} generally east to west. There were two main buildings in the west and east ends, separated by a courtyard. Many sections of the <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> are still standing and the foundations of the wall are visible over most of the site. The old gate is located {{on the west side of}} the <b>ring</b> <b>wall.</b> The gatehouse was probably two or three stories tall and was also used for housing. The medieval wooden platform which led to the west gate long ago rotted away and today the only access into the castle is a narrow crack in the wall on east side. The residential and administrative building on the east side of the castle was expanded at least once. A gate on the northern side allowed access to the east building from the courtyard.|$|E
50|$|Evidence for {{habitation}} on {{the surface}} is first apparent in the 9th century. A sort of fortified farmstead existed at this time. A <b>ring</b> <b>wall</b> encompassed several wooden buildings {{in the area of}} the later donjon.|$|E
