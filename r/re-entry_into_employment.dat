Cox Proportional Hazard Models with stratum effects for three medical clinics, and Accelerated Failure Time Models with individual specific unobserved shared effects (frailty), are estimated for transitions from inactivity to unemployment, and transitions from unemployment into employment, using a longitudinal data set. The {{findings of this study}} indicate that HAART leads to greater activity in the labour market, but there was not a strong effect on <b>re-entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment...</b>|$|E
3000|$|Our {{empirical}} analysis exploits {{the features}} of the recent Spanish economic crisis to identify the causal effect of unemployment on health. We employ a two-stage least square estimation technique where the individual unemployment variable in Eq. (2) is instrumented using cell-level exposure to the collapse of employment opportunities in the construction sector. We argue that this instrument, {{in the context of the}} Spanish recession, satisfies the exclusion restriction, by generating job losses that are exogenous to unobserved individual characteristics. We further discuss that, in our context, <b>re-entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment</b> is almost impossible, a fact that bears important implications for the interpretation of our results. We next examine these two assumptions theoretically in a static framework. 16 [...]...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the social and private returns to {{graduation}} for mature students in the U K. However, the post-Dearing changes in the funding of higher education have initially been associated with a significant fall in applications from this group of entrants. This paper, by providing an economic assessment of mature female entrants to higher education, allows a preliminary evaluation of those funding changes. It critically appraises the limited empirical work in this area, identifying fundamental methodological weaknesses. The assessment addresses the issue of <b>re-entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment</b> and relates mature females' entry into HE to the wider i ssue of gender inequality in the labour market. It concludes that a case can be made for continued additional subsidies targeted at this group of entrants. Access, Higher education entrants, Female re-entrants, Gender inequality. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} examines <b>re-entry</b> <b>into</b> {{the labour}} force for mothers after maternity leave. The empirical analysis {{focuses on the}} first twenty-two years of post-reunification Germany, using proportional hazards models. Results show that the <b>re-entry</b> <b>into</b> part-time <b>employment</b> is primarily affected by the mother's own resources and former career, the return to full-time work is more linked to the partner's resources. This behaviour is especially prevalent in families where the mother has a higher earning potential than the father, a group having the highest <b>re-entry</b> chances <b>into</b> full-time <b>employment.</b> The results concerning experiences of unemployment for the male partner show that mothers try to compensate uncertainties with increased labour force participation...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{observations}} of higher labour -market activity among {{women with a}} high-earning spouse and widened household inequality have spurred research interest in earnings homogamy and in effects of own and spouse’s earnings on female labour supply. This article studies trends in earnings homogamy among married and cohabiting parents and in effects of own and spouse’s earnings on mothers’ time in employment and non-employment in Sweden. We analyse, first, correlations between spouses’ earnings and, second, effects of time -varying own and spouse’s earnings on mothers’ transitions between part-time and full-time work, on their exits from and <b>re-entries</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment</b> and on their exits from parental leave over the years 1968 - 92. We use individual life histories from the 1992 Swedish Family Survey combined with longitudinal information on earnings from the national taxation register. A unique aspect of this data set {{is that it has}} very accurate longitudinal earnings information for both married and cohabiting spouses, including former spouses. We find that mothers’ own earnings have a larger and more significant impact on their labour -market transitions than spouse’s earnings and that the impact of the latter has even declined over time. -...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} effect of career breaks on the working lives of women using survey data from the state of Queensland in Australia. After {{estimating}} the income penalty faced by women with career interruptions - according to the duration of, and reasons for, the interruptions - we seek to address a wider set of issues regarding: patterns of job change and income gains or losses related to job change; determinants of career re-entry plans; and satisfaction with hours worked. As women increasingly combine motherhood and employment, they face both penalties and costs, particularly if they have taken a career break in order to care for their young. This general labor market failure that penalizes motherhood should be addressed by relevant measures related to their income, working hours, and the type and status of employment, particularly on their <b>re-entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment</b> after a child-related career break. Gender, labor market, career breaks, motherhood, income penalty,...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{the effects}} of non-employment in early work-life on {{subsequent}} employment chances of individuals in the Netherlands are examined. A main concern is whether the experience of non-employment {{in the beginning of}} the career (permanently) damages a worker’s later employment opportunities (that is, the likelihood of exit out of and <b>re-entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment).</b> The empirical analysis is based on five retrospective life-history surveys collected in the Netherlands in the period 1992 – 2003, with full information on employment histories of individuals. The analytic sample consists of 7, 761 respondents, who left education since the 1950 s. The results of the empirical analysis first of all show that the duration of non-employment in the first 3 years after leaving education (and not the number of non-employment spells in that period) increases the likelihood of exiting employment in the subsequent time period (up until 15 years after leaving education). This finding holds for both men and women. Second, a negative duration effect of non-employment on the likelihood of re-entering employment after a job loss is found, but for men only. These results imply that non-employment in early work-life indeed has a scarring effect on subsequent employment chances of individuals in the Dutch labour market...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} whether low educated men are {{displaced from}} their jobs by higher educated workers in the Netherlands in the period 1980 – 2004. In particular, we test whether structural or cyclical crowding out is predominant in the Dutch labor market. In order to do so, we try to explain the observed trends in education-specific transition rates to entry into first employment from education, exit from employment into unemployment or inactivity, and <b>re-entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment</b> from unemployment or inactivity for men by both business cycle effects (that is, changes in aggregate unemployment rates) and structural effects (that is, changes in labor supply–demand ratios for high educated). Discrete-time event history models are estimated using the OSA Labor Supply Panel 1985 – 2004. Retrospective information enables to study trends from 1980 onwards, so that structural effects can be distinguished from cyclical effects. The results show that structural crowding out exists at both the worker in- and outflow. First of all, {{it was observed that}} a growth in the oversupply of high educated increases the employment exit risk of low educated workers more so than that of higher educated ones. In addition, it was shown that an increase in the oversupply of high educated especially reduces the re-employment chances of low educated unemployed men. There is no evidence found for cyclical crowding out among low educated workers in the Dutch labor market. ...|$|E

3000|$|Governments in most OECD {{countries}} offer {{training programs}} for the unemployed, typically oriented toward vocational/specific skills. The consensus view {{seems to be that}} vocational/specific training is a more efficient measure for unemployed individuals than are courses providing general/theoretical skills. In the short run, learning a branch specific skill is presumed to better enhance <b>re-entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>employment.</b> General training, without an obvious connection to a labor market branch, may have less of an impact. However, in the long run, if general skills increase the ability to learn new tasks, this could make workers less sensitive to changes in the demand for skills. Earlier studies of adults in general education have reported average earnings returns which still increase eight to ten years after enrolment (Jacobson et al. 2003, 2005, Stenberg 2011). As program effects vary between individuals and over time, these estimates are not directly comparable with evaluations of vocational training programs, but they raise {{the question of whether the}} long-term effects of general training would catch up with or exceed the earnings effects of specific training. 1 In addition, an expansion of the menu of programs could also potentially enhance efficiency by allowing individuals to act on their comparative advantages. Some economists have suggested that governments should stimulate adults to enroll in formal schooling during economic downturns (e.g., Heckman and Urzua 2008, Pissarides 2011), but there is an almost complete lack of empirical research on this topic. It is therefore unclear whether skill adjustments among the unemployed should involve a larger element of general training. 2 [...]...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the Objective Three Operational Programme of the European Social Fund during the period from 1994 to 1999, the Land of Northrhine-Westphalia carried out three programmes of active labour market policy oriented towards specific target groups: (1) Employment and Training, largely for young people (AQUA), (2) Target Group Training (QUAZI), and (3) <b>Re-entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>Employment</b> for Women (WEP). In order to finance these programmes, 541 million DEM had been put forward by the ESF which were complemented by the Land. The report presented here is a milestone of the ongoing evaluation. It focuses on (1) the analysis of the regional labour market situations in which the programmes had to be put into practice and (2) on the specific structures of the 'regionalised labour market policy' which have been put into effect in Northrhine-Westphalia as a means of implementing programmes in partnership with local actors. Theses regional structures were researched in depth on the basis of three case studies in three of the 30 labour market regions of the 'Land'.
