40|$|Intensive <b>reindeer</b> grazing and the {{increase}} of other land use forms have caused {{a decline in the}} amount of arboreal (Alectoria, Bryoria spp.) and <b>reindeer</b> (Cladina spp.) lichens in the Finnish <b>reindeer</b> management area during the last few decades. Supplementary feeding of <b>reindeer</b> has increasingly compensated for the lack of natural winter fodder. The amount of the supplementary feeding and {{the quantity and quality of}} summer pastures should therefore have an increasing effect on the productivity of <b>reindeer</b> stock. In order to outline better the present carrying capacity problems on pastures in the Finnish <b>reindeer</b> management area we focused some of the most important productivity factors of Finnish <b>reindeer</b> stock from 1993 to 1999. The results showed that the productivity of <b>reindeer</b> stock in Finland was dependent especially on two main elements: amount of <b>reindeer</b> feeding and <b>reindeer</b> densities on summer pastures. Winter pastures had no clear effect on productivity when analysing the entire management area. High productivity figures in <b>reindeer</b> stock (calf production, carcass mass and meat production per <b>reindeer)</b> were reached in the management districts where winter feeding was the most abundant, <b>reindeer</b> densities relatively low and summer pastures abundant. An increase in <b>reindeer</b> density on summer pastures raised meat production per total summer pasture area but decreased carcass mass of <b>reindeer</b> calves and meat production per <b>reindeer.</b> It seems that the fundamental factor for keeping the <b>reindeer</b> stock productivity sustainable at a high enough level is to optimize the longterm <b>reindeer</b> densities on pastures. Summer pastures may gradually become a limiting factor for <b>reindeer</b> stock productivity in some areas if overgrazed and decreased winter pastures are only compensated for by winter feeding of <b>reindeer.</b>  </p...|$|R

60|$|Perhaps it is {{only when}} {{civilisation}} becomes a disease that it becomes an infection. Possibly {{it is only}} when it becomes a very virulent disease that it becomes an epidemic. Possibly again that is the meaning both of cosmopolitanism and imperialism. Anyhow the tribes sitting by Afric's sunny fountains did not take up the song when Francis of Assisi stood on the very mountain of the Middle Ages, singing the Canticle of the Sun. When Michael Angelo carved a statue in snow, Eskimos did not copy him, despite their large natural quarries or resources. Laplanders never made a model of the Elgin Marbles, with a frieze of <b>reindeers</b> instead of horses; nor did Hottentots try to paint Mumbo Jumbo as Raphael had painted Madonnas. But many a savage king has worn a top-hat, and the barbarian has sometimes been so debased as to add to it a pair of trousers. Explosive bullets and the brutal factory system numbers of advanced natives are anxious to possess. And it was this reflection, arising out of the mere pleasure of the eye in the parti-coloured crowd before me, that brought back my mind to the chief problem and peril of our position in Palestine, on which I touched earlier in this chapter; the peril which is largely at the back both of the just and of the unjust objections to Zionism. It is the fear that the West, in its modern mercantile mood, will send not its best but its worst. The artisan way of putting it, {{from the point of view}} of the Arab, is that it will mean not so much the English merchant as the Jewish money-lender. I shall write elsewhere of better types of Jew and the truths they really represent; but the Jewish money-lender is in a curious and complex sense the representative of this unfortunate paradox. He is not only unpopular both in the East and West, but he is unpopular in the West for being Eastern and in the East for being Western. He is accused in Europe of Asiatic crookedness and secrecy, and in Asia of European vulgarity and bounce. I have said a propos of the Arab that the dignity of the oriental is in his long robe; the merely mercantile Jew is the oriental who has lost his long robe, which leads to a dangerous liveliness in the legs. He bustles and hustles too much; and in Palestine some of the unpopularity even of the better sort of Jew is simply due to his restlessness. But there remains a fear that it will not be a question of the better sort of Jew, or of the better sort of British influence. The same ignominious inversion which reproduces everywhere the factory chimney without the church tower, which spreads a cockney commerce but not a Christian culture, has given many men a vague feeling that the influence of modern civilisation will surround these ragged but coloured groups with something as dreary and discoloured, as unnatural and as desolate as the unfamiliar snow in which they were shivering as I watched them. There seemed a sort of sinister omen in this strange visitation that the north had sent them; in the fact that when the north wind blew at last, it had only scattered on them this silver dust of death.|$|E

40|$|We {{reviewed}} {{historical records}} of the abundance and distribution of wild <b>reindeer</b> {Rangifer tarandus L.) in Chukotka and studied <b>reindeer</b> numbers, distribution and behavior from 1983 to 1993. There were large numbers of wild <b>reindeer</b> in Chukotka {{until the end of}} the eighteenth century, but during the nineteenth century the population declined probably from intensive harvest after the introduction of firearms by the Cossacks. During the nineteenth century herding of domestic <b>reindeer</b> also increased, and <b>reindeer</b> herders continued to hunt wild <b>reindeer</b> intensively. During the 1950 s there were only about 8500 wild <b>reindeer</b> in two separate herds in Chukotka. By the late 1970 s the wild <b>reindeer</b> population had increased to about 11 000. Ten years later we estimated 16 534 <b>reindeer,</b> and found only one contiguous population. Presently, the population calves and spends the summer in the Anadyr Uplands and migrates west and southwest to spend the winter in forest tundra and northern taiga regions. Predators, primarily wolves and brown bears, kill a significant number of calves. Today, the wild <b>reindeer</b> in Chukotka coexist with 300 000 domestic <b>reindeer.</b> However, current costs of gasoline and helicopters make it prohibitive to herd <b>reindeer</b> in much of central Chukotka, so that wild <b>reindeer</b> have room for expansion. Poaching is a major conservation problem. Poachers shoot wild <b>reindeer</b> from helicopters to obtain velvet antlers. Leaders of domestic <b>reindeer</b> cooperatives encourage poaching by telling people that wild <b>reindeer</b> are in fact just stray domestic <b>reindeer</b> and there is no enforcement of game laws...|$|R

The last remaining wild tundra <b>reindeer</b> in Europe are found in portions of southern Norway. The International Centre for <b>Reindeer</b> Husbandry (ICR), a circumpolar organization, was established in 2005 by the Norwegian government. ICR represents over 20 indigenous <b>reindeer</b> peoples and about 100,000 <b>reindeer</b> herders in 9 different national states.

40|$|Contamination by {{excrements}} {{will increase}} {{in areas with}} high animal densities, such as snow free patches with accessible forage in winter and holding paddocks. Avoidance of faeces dropped by other grazers may result in interference competition by reducing optimal forage intake, or offer protection from the transfer of parasites or disease. We conducted two enclosure experiments investigating <b>reindeer</b> (Rangifer tarandus) reactions towards faeces. The first experiment tested whether <b>reindeer</b> avoid pasture contaminated with faeces from <b>reindeer</b> or sheep (Ovis aries). Both high (0. 5 kg/m 2) and low (0. 05 kg/m 2) concentrations of faeces reduced <b>reindeer</b> grazing compared to no faeces. <b>Reindeer</b> grazed significantly less in areas with high concentration of faeces compared to areas with low concentrations, with equally strong avoidance regardless of faeces source. The second experiment analysed the defecation pattern (random or not) of <b>reindeer</b> in a 50 m x 40 m enclosure to investigate how this pattern might change following the introduction of female sheep or additional female <b>reindeer.</b> Both <b>reindeer</b> and sheep defecated in a non-random pattern that was related to their preferred bedding sites. When sheep visited <b>reindeer,</b> the species' faeces distributions were positively correlated, indicating that <b>reindeer</b> and sheep had an overlap in area utilization, at least while bedding. When additional <b>reindeer</b> were introduced and then removed, the combined resident and visiting reindeers' faeces distributions were negatively correlated with the resident reindeers' faeces distribution following {{the removal of the}} visiting <b>reindeer.</b> This suggested that resident <b>reindeer</b> avoided the visiting reindeers' faeces. Resident <b>reindeer</b> also produced fewer total droppings when visited by new <b>reindeer,</b> while the number of droppings did not change when visited by sheep. Thus, resident <b>reindeer</b> were more adversely affected by the introduction of new <b>reindeer</b> even after their removal than by the introduction of sheep. In conclusion, the amount and distribution of excrements will {{play an important role in}} <b>reindeer</b> grazing and area use in pastures maintaining high densities of <b>reindeer</b> or <b>reindeer</b> and sheep...|$|R

40|$|In arctic and sub-arctic regions semi-domestic <b>reindeer</b> {{management}} {{forms an}} important livelihood {{which should be}} able to provide enough income for herders. <b>Reindeer</b> management has natural limits of growth.
