The aim of my work is to summarize basic conditions of the procedural <b>representation.</b> The structure of my thesis is divided into five chapters. In the introduction I shortly deal with the basic concepts of the issue, the definition of <b>representation,</b> constitutional background and {{the interpretation of the}} procedural relationship. The second chapter is dedicated to the brief historical overview of the development of procedural <b>representation,</b> in particular in Roman law and the <b>representation</b> under the Act No. 142 / 1950 Coll, on civil proceedings. The third chapter provides with the valid concept of <b>representation</b> pursuant to the Act. No. 99 / 1963 Coll, civil procedure code. I analyze in details elements of each type of procedural <b>representation</b> which I divided in the <b>representation</b> under the law, <b>representation</b> under the decision of a court which is further internally divided into <b>representation</b> with the character of legal <b>representation</b> and <b>representation</b> with the character of <b>representation</b> by agent, and <b>representation</b> under the power of attorney.

5|$|Another key {{elements}} to Durkheim's theory {{of knowledge is}} his concept of <b>représentations</b> collectives (collective <b>representations),</b> which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. <b>Représentations</b> collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not reducible to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that {{can serve as a}} symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, <b>représentations</b> collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these <b>representations</b> have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{argues that}} mental states, such as beliefs and desires, are {{relations}} between individuals and mental <b>representations.</b> He maintains that these <b>representations</b> {{can only be}} correctly {{explained in terms of}} a language of thought (LOT) in the mind.

Fodor adheres to a species of functionalism, maintaining that thinking and other mental processes consist primarily of computations operating on the syntax of the <b>representations</b> that make up the language of thought.|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>representation,</b> as {{developed}} in Hanna Pitkins seminal work, {{is a complex}} structure, whose multiple dimensions are hypothesized to be closely interconnected. Most empirical work, however, ignores the integrated character of <b>representation</b> and examines its several dimensions in isolation.

This research tests an integrated model of <b>representation</b> linking formal, descriptive, substantive and symbolic <b>representation.</b> Data on the <b>representation</b> of women in 31 democracies confirms the interconnections among the several dimensions of <b>representation.</b> The structure of electoral systems exerts powerful influences on both womens descriptive <b>representation</b> and symbolic <b>representation.</b> Descriptive <b>representation,</b> in turn, increases legislatures responsiveness to womens policy concerns and enhances perceptions of legitimacy. The effects of substantive <b>representation,</b> however, are much less than theory anticipates. 1 The concept of <b>representation</b> is a rich brocade whose complex weave is not fully appreciated.

5|$|For finite-dimensional <b>representations,</b> the {{presence}} of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz group {{can be dealt with}} the same way as other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all <b>representations</b> are built from the irreducible ones, since the Lie algebra possesses the complete reducibility property. But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of simple connectedness, cannot be dealt with in all the aspects as in the simple framework that applies to simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies, for a connected simple Lie group, that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary <b>representations</b> exist. Lack of simple connectedness gives rise to spin <b>representations</b> of the group. The non-connectedness means that, for <b>representations</b> of the full Lorentz group, time reversal and space inversion has to dealt with separately.|$|E

40|$|International audienceSparse <b>representation</b> has {{attracted}} much attention from researchers in fields of signalprocessing, image processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Sparse <b>representation</b> also has agood reputation in both theoretical research and practical applications. Many different algorithms have beenproposed for sparse <b>representation.</b> The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide a comprehensive study and an updated review on sparse <b>representation</b> and to supply guidance for researchers. The taxonomy of sparse <b>representation</b> methods can be studied from various viewpoints. For example, in terms of different norm minimizations used in sparsity constraints, the methods can be roughly categorized into five groups: sparse <b>representation</b> with $l_ 0 $-norm minimization; sparse <b>representation</b> with $l_p$-norm ($ 0 sparse <b>representation</b> with $l_ 1 $-norm minimization; sparse <b>representation</b> with $l_{ 2, 1 }$-norm minimization; and sparse <b>representation</b> with $l_ 2 $-norm minimization. In this paper, a comprehensive overview of sparse <b>representation</b> is provided. The available sparse <b>representation</b> algorithms can also be empirically categorized into four groups: greedy strategy approximation; constrained optimization; proximity algorithm-based optimization; and homotopy algorithm-based sparse <b>representation.</b> The rationales of different algorithms in each category are analyzed and a wide range of sparse <b>representation</b> applications are summarized, which could sufficiently reveal the potential nature of the sparse <b>representation</b> theory.
