5|$|The third mass {{production}} {{model of the}} He 111H was the H-16, entering production in late 1942. Armament was as on the H-11, with some differences. The 20mm MG FF cannon was deleted, as the H-16s were seldom employed on low-level missions, was replaced with a single MG 131 in a flexible installation in the nose (A-Stand). On some aircraft, designated He 111H-16/R1, the dorsal position {{was replaced by a}} Drehlafette DL 131 electrically powered turret, armed with a single MG 131. The two beam and the aft ventral positions were provided with MG 81Zs, as on the H-11. The two 1,000kW (1,340hp) Jumo 211 F-2 provided a maximum speed of 434km/h (270mph) at 6,000m (19,690ft); cruising speed was 390km/h (242mph), service ceiling was 8,500m (27,900ft).Funkgerät (FuG) radio equipment. FuG 10P, FuG 16, FuBl Z and APZ 6 were fitted for communication and navigation at night, while some aircraft received the FuG 101a <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter.</b> The H-16 retained its eight ESAC internal bomb cells; four bomb cells, as on previous versions could be replaced by a fuel tank to increase range. ETC 2000 racks could be installed over the bomb cell openings for external weapons carriage. Empty weight was 6,900kg (15,210lb) and the aircraft weighed 14,000kg (30,860lb) fully loaded for take off. German factories built 1,155 H-16s between the end of 1942 and the end of 1943; in addition, 280 H-6s and 35 H-11s were updated to H-16 standard. An undetermined number of H variants were fitted with the FuG 200 Hohentwiel. The radar was adapted as an anti-shipping detector for day or night operations.|$|E
25|$|A <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> {{measures}} altitude {{above the}} terrain presently beneath an aircraft or spacecraft. This type of altimeter provides {{the distance between}} the plane and the ground directly below it, as opposed to a barometric altimeter which provides the distance above a pre-determined datum, usually sea level. In 1924, American engineer Lloyd Espenschied invented the <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter.</b> However, it took 14 years before Bell Labs was able to put Espenschied's device in a form that was adaptable for aircraft use.|$|E
25|$|The {{crash was}} caused {{primarily}} by the aircraft's automated reaction which was triggered by a faulty <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter.</b> This caused the autothrottle to decrease the engine power to idle during approach. The crew noticed this too late to take appropriate action to increase the thrust and recover the aircraft before it stalled and crashed. Boeing has since issued a bulletin to remind pilots of all 737 series and BBJ aircraft {{of the importance of}} monitoring airspeed and altitude, advising against the use of autopilot or autothrottle while landing in cases of <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> discrepancies.|$|E

The U4 was fitted with only two MG 151/20 cannon as fixed armament.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{among these}} {{differences}} was {{a conclusion that}} the pilots were not placed under pressure forcing them to land at Smolensk, and furthermore the crew {{did not want to}} land and after reaching 100m altitude (measured by <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter)</b> and had decided to go around using the autopilot. However, it was impossible for the autopilot installed in the aircraft to conduct an automatic go-around from a non-precision approach. The Polish investigation concluded this caused a delay in executing the go-around which contributed to the crash.|$|E

Two redundant mission computers control the weapons, sensors, and targeting functions. The Tiger's navigational suite includes GPS, dual redundant inertial referencing, Doppler radar, separated air data units, <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> and distributed air speed sensors.

25|$|The Dutch Safety Board {{stated that}} the {{approach}} was not stabilized so the crew should have initiated a go around. The autopilot followed the glide slope while the autothrottle reduced thrust to idle due to a faulty <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter</b> showing an incorrect height. This caused the airspeed to drop and the pitch attitude to increase all unnoticed by the crew until the stick shaker activated. Prior to this, air traffic control caused the crew to intercept the glide slope from above and this obscured the erroneous autothrottle mode and increased the crew’s workload. The subsequent approach to stall recovery procedure was not executed properly, causing the aircraft to stall and crash.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide range}} of {{avionics}} have been integrated upon the AW119, which are typically housed within the rotorcraft's nose. Initial production models featured conventional flight instruments; the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit is integrated on the newer AW119Kx variant, which is claimed to improve situational awareness, reduce pilot workload, and increase safety. Primary flight and other key information is displayed to the pilots upon two large 10.4 inch multi-function displays in the cockpit; an independently powered stand-by display is also present in case of system failure. Other avionics used include a 3-axis aircraft flight control system (AFCS), Synthetic Vision System (SVS), Highway In The Sky (HITS) depiction, moving map display, <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter,</b> VOR/ILS/GPS/WAAS navigation, Aural Warning Generator, and embedded Helicopter Terrain Avoidance Warning System (HTAWS).|$|E

We discuss two main reasons for the wind-speed retrieval errors: (i) ambiguous relationship between the wind speed and the backscattering cross section and (ii) regional features of the wave climate formation.

This would happen so fast that the flight crew may not effectively respond. For this reason Autoland systems are designed to incorporate a high degree of redundancy so that a single failure of any part of the system can be tolerated (fail active) and a second failure can be detected - at which point the autoland system will turn itself off (uncouple, fail passive).

40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{complete}} design and analysis of a new integrated balanced transmitter operated at 4 GHz using microstrip technology. It comprises a 4 GHz two-port negative resistance oscillator and a microstrip-patch antenna resonated at 4 GHz. Three different modules are designed and analyzed. The first one used a Lange coupler as a power splitter while the second and third used a one (two) -section branch coupler. The components of the three modules are designed using full-scale computer simulation program named with MSDES, performed by the author, which fully takes into account all the discontinuities included in the microstrip lines, while the modules are analyzed and optimized using APLAC V 7. 61 software. The design methodologies of the two-port negative resistance oscillator and microstrip patch antenna are introduced and explained. The analyses of the designed modules show a better efficiency and good performance. The modules give a transmit-antenna gain of 15. 7 dB with antenna beam widths 91. 7 ◦ and 18. 2 ◦ in E-and H-planes, respectively. The complete schematic diagrams of the transmitter modules are drawn. These modules can be used in satellite communications, Doppler and other radars, active and semi-active seekers, <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters,</b> missile technology, weapon fuzing, manpack equipments, remote sensing, feed elements in complex antennas...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A novel {{microstrip}} {{array antenna}} {{based on the}} meta-material zeroth-order resonator (ZOR) is presented in this paper. Considering both zeroth-order resonance and the array theory, a resonant array antenna has been designed and fabricated which has small dimensions both in length and width {{as well as an}} acceptable gain. Since the resonant frequency of the zeroth-order resonator is independent of the physical length of the resonator and determined only by LC values loaded in the resonator, therefore, antenna size can be reduced arbitrarily with no changes in the operation frequency and due to the array structure antenna gain can be enhanced. Additional benefit of the ZOR antennas is lower ohmic losses as compared to the other small antennas and hence the efficiency of the antenna is higher. The discrepancy between simulation and measurement determined by fabricating some of the simulated design and comparison between the results, has been taken into account for designing the final array. A small-sized two-elements ZOR array antenna with 50 % reduction in size as compared to the conventional array with a acceptable gain and broad radiation pattern is tested at 4. 25 GHz. The proposed antenna has application in <b>radio</b> <b>altimeters.</b> The commercial softwares such as CST and HFSS were utilized for design and analysis of the structure. 1...|$|R

Initial flight was on 9 April 1982. Cameroon obtained seven (some sources claim 6) and Egypt obtained 15.

2500|$|The sky {{was dark}} and the pilots lacked any visual ground references.

While retaining use of the autopilot, the pilots reduced their speed to [...] at the request of air-traffic control at 19:07. At this point the pilots were working through the approach checklist. The captain halted the checklist at the point regarding the <b>radio</b> <b>altimeter,</b> as the aircraft was above its operational limit, and he wanted to control the plane's operation during further descent. At 19:11, the aircraft received permission to bear 180 degrees and descend to and maintain 1,000 meters (3,000ft) of altitude. Both navigational receivers were tuned to the ILS frequency.|$|E
2500|$|The {{data from}} the flight {{recorder}} also showed that the same altimeter problem had happened twice during the previous eight landings but that on both occasions the crew had taken the correct action by disengaging the autothrottle and manually increasing the thrust.
