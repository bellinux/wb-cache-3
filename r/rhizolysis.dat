40|$|Low {{back pain}} {{may arise from}} {{degenerative}} changes in the posterior joints of the lumbar spine. These joints are innervated by {{a branch of the}} posterior primary ramus, which follows an anatomically constant course. Pain impulses from these joints can be interrupted by coagulating this nerve with a radiofrequency wave, the probe having been placed {{in the area of the}} nerve percutaneously. Percutaneous lumbar <b>rhizolysis</b> was carried out under local anesthesia on an outpatient basis in 82 patients, most of whom had multiple level <b>rhizolysis.</b> <b>Rhizolysis</b> was successful in 67 % of patients with mechanical low back pain without evidence of disc herniation and nerve-root compression or psychogenic pain, who had not previously undergone an operation for relief of the pain...|$|E

40|$|Aim. The {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of trigeminal neuralgia treatment by Hakanson S. glycerol <b>rhizolysis</b> method. Methods. The results of glycerol <b>rhizolysis</b> treatment were retrospectively evaluated in 96 patients with trigeminal neuralgia, who had been operated at Neurosurgical Department of Irkutsk City Hospital over a period from 2009 to 2016. To study the prospective follow-up, 53 patients operated during 2009 – 2014 were surveyed over the phone. The comparison of our long-term results and the results of other authors from literature sources was then performed. Results. The median of follow-up period was 43 months. The pain recurrence (III-V rate of Barrow Neurological Institute score for trigeminal neuralgia) was observed in 30. 2 % of patients, with the mean rate of the visual analogue scale amounting to 1. 96. Complications included aseptic meningitis in 3. 1 % cases, intracerebral hematoma – 1. 04 %, hyperesthesia in appropriate trigeminal region – 3. 8 %, labial herpes – 40. 7 %, temporary anesthesia in appropriate trigeminal region – 30. 2 %, temporary decrease of corneal reflex sensitivity – 41. 5 %. There was no postoperative mortality. Conclusion. Glycerol <b>rhizolysis</b> is an effective method of trigeminal neuralgia treatment and its results are comparable with those of other surgical methods. Strict adherence to all surgical steps and contrast cistenography is the key to success of intervention. The method is minimally invasive, applicable for anesthesia and particularly promising for patients over 70 years old. Received 25 May 2016. Accepted 14 September 2016.

40|$|Subcutaneous <b>rhizolysis</b> {{is defined}} as cutting the nerves to the {{posterior}} intervertebral joints. Although a blind procedure, it has proved safe in several centres and provides relief of pain in about two thirds of those who suffer from intractable, persistent backache. Some conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis and previous spinal fusion are clinically unsuitable, but this technique, which is described, is recommended for consideration before all major surgical procedures for back pain are undertaken...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Objectives: The central odontogenic fibroma (COF) is {{a benign}} odontogenic tumour {{derived from the}} dental mesenchymal tissues. It is a rare tumour and only 70 cases of it have been published. Bearing in mind the rareness of the tumour, 8 new cases of central odontogenic fibroma have been found by {{analyzing}} the clinical, radiological and histopathological characteristics of COF. Patients and Method: A retrospective study was carried out on 3011 biopsies in the Service of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Dental Clinic of Barcelona University between January 1995 and March 2008. 85 odontogenic tumours were diagnosed of which 8 were central odontogenic fibroma. The radiological study was based on orthopantomographs, periapical and occlusal radiographies and computerised tomographics. The variables collected were: sex, age, clinical characteristics of the lesion, treatment received and possible reappearances of the tumour. Results: The central odontogenic fibroma represents 9. 4 % of all odontogenic tumours. Of the 8 cases, 5 were diagnosed in men and 3 in women. The average age was 19. 9 years with an age range of 11 to 38 years. The most common location of the tumour was in the mandible. All cases were associated with unerupted teeth. Of the 8 tumours, 3 provoked <b>rhizolysis</b> of the adjacent teeth and 4 cases caused cortical bone expansion. 50 % of the patients complained of pain associated to the lesion. No case of recurrence was recorded up to 2 years after the treatment. Conclusions: Central odontogenic fibromas usually evolve asymptomatically although they can manifest very aggressively provoking dental displacement and <b>rhizolysis.</b> Radiologically, COF manifest as a uni or multilocular radiotransparent image although they can be indistinguishable from other radiotransparent lesions making diagnosis more difficult. COF treatment involves conservative surgery as well as follow-up patient checks. © Medicina Oral S. L...|$|E
40|$|Forty {{patients}} of trigeminal neuralgia {{were treated with}} percutaneous trigeminal ganglion balloon compression. Symptoms had been present since six months to twenty years. The age ranged between 23 years and 73 years. All the patients had immediate relief from pain. Two had already undergone trigeminal cistern <b>rhizolysis.</b> One patient had foramen ovale stenosis. After the procedure, all the patients had mild to moderate degree of ipsilateral facial sensory loss which included buccal mucosa and anterior 2 / 3 rd of the tongue. Facial dysaesthesia (anaesthesia dolorosa) was seen in only one case, who had mild involvement lasting one week. Thirty patients had altered taste sensation, probably due to general somatic sensory loss. Five patients had herpes perioralis. In this study group, two patients had already undergone microvascular decompression. All the patients were followed for a period ranging from one to eighteen months. Balloon compression technique seems {{to be better than}} injection of alcohol, glycerol or radio frequency lesion. Recurrence of pain was noted in 3 patients after one year...|$|E
40|$|Trigeminal {{neuralgia}} {{is characterized}} by recurrent episodes of intense lancinating pain affecting the face localized to the sensory supply areas of the trigeminal nerve. There {{is a lack of}} certainty regarding the etiology and pathophysiology of trigeminal neuralgia. The diagnosis of idiopathic typical trigeminal neuralgia requires the absence of clinically evident neurological deficit. Treatment must be individualized to each patient. Various trigeminal neural blockades can be options when medical therapy fails to relieve pain. Neural bloc-kades include peripheral nerve branch blocks and intracranial nerve root or ganglion blocks such as RF thermocoagulation, percutaneous balloon com-pression and glycerol <b>rhizolysis.</b> Neural blockade with local anesthetics produces temporary effects, but neural blockade with neurolytics like alcohol lasts longer, around one or two years. They are very useful for patients with poor general condition or high risk. RF rhizotomy and balloon compression of trigeminal ganglion are relatively more invasive treatment options, but have more cost effective-ness with less serious complications compared to other surgical procedures. The continuous impro-vement of neural block techniques is necessary for better treatment of trigeminal neuralgia...|$|E
40|$|Trigeminal {{neuralgia}} is {{a disorder}} associated with severe episodes of lancinating {{pain in the}} distribution of the trigeminal nerve. Previous reports indicate that 80 - 90 % of cases are related to compression of the trigeminal nerve by an adjacent vessel. The majority of patients with trigeminal neuralgia eventually require surgical management in order to achieve remission of symptoms. Surgical options for management include ablative procedures (e. g., radiosurgery, percutaneous radiofrequency lesioning, balloon compression, glycerol <b>rhizolysis,</b> etc.) and microvascular decompression. Ablative procedures fail to address the root cause of the disorder and are less effective at preventing recurrence of symptoms over the long term than microvascular decompression. However, microvascular decompression is inherently more invasive than ablative procedures and is associated with increased surgical risks. Previous studies have demonstrated a correlation between surgeon experience and patient outcome in microvascular decompression. In this series of 59 patients operated on by two neurosurgeons (JSN and PEK) since 2006, 93 % of patients demonstrated substantial improvement in their trigeminal neuralgia following the procedure—with follow-up ranging from 6 weeks to 2 years. Moreover, 41 of 66 patients (approximately 64 %) have been entirely pain-free following the operation. In this publication, video format is utilized to review the microsurgical pathology of this disorder. Steps of the operative procedure are reviewed and salient principles and technical nuances useful in minimizing complications and maximizing efficacy are discussed...|$|E
