40|$|Bridge {{circuits}} {{are among}} the most elemental and powerful electrical tools. They are found in measurement, switching, oscillator and transducer circuits. Additionally, bridge techniques are broadband, serving from DC to bandwidths well into the GHz range. The electrical analog of the mechanical beam balance, they are also the progenitor of all electrical differential techniques. Resistance Bridges Figure 1 shows a basic <b>resistor</b> <b>bridge.</b> The circuit is usually credited to Charles Wheatstone, although S. H. Christie, who demonstrated it in 1833, almost certainly preceded him. 1 If all resistor values are equal (or the two sides ratios are equal) the differential voltage is zero. The excitation voltage does not alter this, as it affects both sides equally. When the bridge is operating off null, the excitation’s magnitude sets output sensitivity. The bridge output is nonlinear for a single variable resistor. Similarly, two variable arms (e. g., RC and RB both variable) produce nonlinear output, although sensitivity doubles. Linear outputs are possible by complementary resistance swings in one or both sides of the bridge. A great deal of attention has been directed towards this circuit. An almost uncountable number of tricks and techniques have been applied to enhance linearity, sensitivit...|$|E

This technology utilizes electrochemical redox reactions to form nanoscale metallic filaments in an isolating amorphous solid electrolyte. Ge chalcogenides are candidate materials for high performance solid electrolytes in combination with Ag as the preferred metal showing high mobility and switching speed. Due to the thermal budget for a back end of the line (BEOL) processing, the layer stack materials must withstand temperatures in the range of 300 - 450 degrees C.

High temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) and electrical characterization with stepwise annealing were applied to characterize the thermal stability of Ag/GeSe and Ag/GeS material systems. The higher onset temperature for solid-state reactions found with HT-XRD in the Ag/GeS system is the key for the better electrical performance compared to the Ag/GeSe system.

The modifications include adding a device for electronic switching of additional <b>bridge</b> <b>resistors</b> in parallel with the balance resistor, Rb. Severe large-amplitude transients are observed {{as a result of}} the switching even for moderate changes in RR.

Observations demonstrate that the RR switching also introduces lower frequency components that appear to be identical to the usual electronic square wave response that is used to tune constant-temperature anemometers. A theoretical model for the transient behaviour using a similar generalized Laplace transform method to Watmuff [2] remains to be derived. Calibration data at high subsonic and transonic Mach numbers have been obtained in the DSTO TransonicWind Tunnel (TWT).

The silicide layer was formed by rapid thermal processing (RTP) in nitrogen via a solid-solid reaction between titanium and poly-Si. The integrity, upon heat treatment, of the TiSi 2 film on large areas was investigated by Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS) analysis, plan-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and cross-sectional SEM studies.

To provide for statistical variation about one hundred measurements were collected for each linewidth and temperature setting. The results clearly show that the thermal stability of the bilayer is a function of the amount and type of dopants in the polysilicon, favoring the use of high levels of arsenic. Moreover, the thermal stability was observed to be affected by the linewidth, since at the temperature for onset of degradation (above 900 -degrees-C), narrow lines were found to disintegrate at a much higher rate than wider ones. Cross-sectional SEM and TEM micrographs of the polycide lines clearly reveal the TiSi 2 /poly-Si interface to suffer from bowing.
