5|$|All the {{interesting}} cases of homotopy groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher-dimensional sphere {{onto one of}} lower dimension. Unfortunately, the only example which can easily be visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, π2(S1) = 0. This is because S1 has the <b>real</b> <b>line</b> as its universal cover which is contractible (it has the homotopy type of a point). In addition, because S2 is simply connected, by the lifting criterion, any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map into the <b>real</b> <b>line</b> and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space.|$|E
5|$|A {{stochastic}} or {{random process}} {{can be defined as}} a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each random variable of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the <b>real</b> <b>line,</b> such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each random variable in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the <b>real</b> <b>line</b> or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
5|$|Although less used, the {{separability}} {{assumption is}} considered more general because every stochastic process has a separable version. It {{is also used}} {{when it is not}} possible to construct a stochastic process in a Skorokhod space. For example, separability is assumed when constructing and studying random fields, where the collection of random variables is now indexed by sets other than the <b>real</b> <b>line</b> such as -dimensional Euclidean space.|$|E

In this case the points at infinity of [...] are real (intersection of a real plane with <b>real</b> <b>lines).</b> Thus the plane sections of [...] cannot be circles (neither ellipses).|$|R
5|$|If {{the state}} space is the {{integers}} or natural numbers, then the stochastic process {{is called a}} discrete or integer-valued stochastic process. If the state space is the <b>real</b> <b>line,</b> then the stochastic process {{is referred to as}} a real-valued stochastic process or a process with continuous state space. If the state space is -dimensional Euclidean space, then the stochastic process is called a -dimensional vector process or -vector process.|$|E
5|$|Martingales {{can also}} be created from {{stochastic}} processes by applying some suitable transformations, which {{is the case for}} the homogeneous Poisson process (on the <b>real</b> <b>line)</b> resulting in a martingale called the compensated Poisson process.

5|$|Skorokhod {{function}} {{spaces are}} frequently {{used in the}} theory of stochastic processes because it often assumed that the sample functions of continuous-time stochastic processes belong to a Skorokhod space. Such spaces contain continuous functions, which correspond to sample functions of the Wiener process. But the space also has functions with discontinuities, which means that the sample functions of stochastic processes with jumps, such as the Poisson process (on the <b>real</b> <b>line),</b> are also members of this space.|$|E

40|$|A {{classical}} result due to Segre {{states that}} on a real cubic surface in P 3 R there exist two kinds of real lines: elliptic and hyperbolic lines. These two kinds of <b>real</b> <b>lines</b> are defined in an intrinsic way, i. e., their definition {{does not depend on}} any choices of orientation data. Segre's classification of smooth real cubic surfaces also shows that any such surface contains at least 3 <b>real</b> <b>lines.</b> Starting from these remarks and inspired by the classical problem mentioned above, our article has the following goals: (a) We explain a general principle which leads to lower bounds in real algebraic geometry. (b) We explain the reason for the appearance of intrinsic signs in the classical problem treated by Segre, showing that the same phenomenon occurs in a large class of enumerative problems in real algebraic geometry. (c) We illustrate these principles in the enumerative problem for <b>real</b> <b>lines</b> in <b>real</b> hypersurfaces of degree 2 m- 3 in PmR...|$|R
5|$|The {{homogeneous}} Poisson {{process can}} be defined and generalized in different ways. It can be defined such that its index set is the <b>real</b> <b>line,</b> and this stochastic process is also called the stationary Poisson process. If the parameter constant of the Poisson process is replaced with some non-negative integrable function of , the resulting process is called an inhomogeneous or nonhomogeneous Poisson process, where the average density of points of the process is no longer constant. Serving as a fundamental process in queueing theory, the Poisson process is an important process for mathematical models, where it finds applications for models of events randomly occurring in certain time windows.|$|E

40|$|We derive {{a formula}} expressing {{the average number}} E_n of <b>real</b> <b>lines</b> on a random hypersurface of degree 2 n- 3 in RP^n {{in terms of the}} {{expected}} modulus of the determinant of a special random matrix. In the case n= 3 we prove that the average number of <b>real</b> <b>lines</b> on a random cubic surface in RP^ 3 equals: E_ 3 = 6 √(2) - 3. Our technique {{can also be used to}} express the number C_n of complex lines on a generic hypersurface of degree 2 n- 3 in CP^n in terms of the determinant of a random Hermitian matrix. As a special case we obtain a new proof of the classical statement C_ 3 = 27. We determine, at the logarithmic scale, the asymptotic of the quantity E_n, by relating it to C_n (whose asymptotic has been recently computed D. Zagier). Specifically we prove that: _n→∞ E_n/ C_n= 1 / 2. Finally we show that this approach can be used to compute the number R_n=(2 n- 3) !! of <b>real</b> <b>lines,</b> counted with their intrinsic signs, on a generic real hypersurface of degree 2 n- 3 in RP^n.

Thus, they provide psychophysical evidence for a common localization mechanism that supports real and illusory contour definitions.
