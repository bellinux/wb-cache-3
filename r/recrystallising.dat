However, the recrystallisation mechanisms, whether static or dynamic (taking place during deformation) are still not clarified. This report investigates extruded axisymmetric Al-Mg-Si alloys with respect to evolution in texture and microstructure in a spontaneously <b>recrystallised</b> material (i. e. during extrusion) and in a material which is deformed after extrusion and then <b>recrystallised</b> during subsequent annealing at different temperatures. Comparison between the post-heat treated and spontaneously <b>recrystallised</b> material have been done to characterise and identify differences in the recrystallisation behaviour and possible difference in mechanisms. Some simulations have also been conducted by the softening model ALSOFT to compare the experimental results with the model predictions. The spontaneously <b>recrystallised</b> material showed a texture which differed from the material which <b>recrystallised</b> during post-extrusion heat treatment. This demonstrates a difference in recrystallisation behaviour and possibly the nucleation mechanisms. ALSOFT simulations seemed to give reasonable grain size results when comparing them to the experimental results in this project. However, the relative contribution from different nucleation mechanism predicted by ALSOFT did not comply well with experimental data. The recrystallisation texture software RDB_texture was successfully implemented into Matlab. RDB_texture was created for rolling, therefore, some modifications to the Matlab implementation was made to make it applicable for axisymmetric extruded round bars. Most notably {{it is possible to}} choose both orthorhombic and triclinic specimen symmetry. The simulated textures were compared with experimentally found textures in order to identify input parameters giving the best agreement with experimental results. By simulating recrystallisation texture, a set of weighting factors for different nucleation mechanisms giving the best agreement with statically <b>recrystallised</b> samples was determined.

Precipitation and recrystallisation occurred concurrently during most of the annealing period, with precipitates forming preferentially along prior grain and twin boundaries.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of grain boundary migration during recrystallisation in metals, {{the details of the}} mechanism are not well known and there are few direct and accurate experimental observations. The main scope of this thesis is therefore to study the local grain boundary motion in an Al-Mn alloy and observe its interaction with obstacles in the deformed matrix. Given {{the importance}} of grain boundary interaction with secondary phases it is necessary to have detailed knowledge on the precipitate population. Chapter 2 describes a measurement procedure for particle quantification. To transform the raw 2 D data in a 3 D particle size distribution a refined version of the traditional Saltikov technique is applied. In chapter 3 the particle quantification method is applied to the AA 3103 alloy. It was possible to determine that during homogenisation the constituent particles partially transform from Al 6 Mn to α-Al 12 (Fe,Mn) 3 Si, while small α-Al 12 (Fe,Mn) 3 Si and large Al 6 Mn plate-like type dispersoids form in the grain interior accompanied by a large decrease in Mn solute level. During break-down rolling constituents and plate-like particles align in the rolling direction, while some also show signs of break-up, and dispersoids increase in number density and grow slightly. During hot rolling and coil cooling the Mn level decreases, mainly due to constituent growth; while during back annealing of the cold rolled sheet the Mn depletion increases due to dispersoid growth and number increase, until recrystallisation is complete. The requirements for an in-situ observation technique for observing grain boundary motion during recrystallisation are described in chapter 4, which also contains a description of the final experimental approach. The best conditions for observing grain boundary motion in aluminium alloys and potential interactions with dispersoids are offered by in-situ heating in a FEG-SEM operated in the backscatter detection mode and with a maximum orientation contrast. For each sequence during the annealing stage, the outline of the <b>recrystallising</b> front is traced using advanced image software to create a displacement map that can be compared to the initial structure and the EBSD plot. According to classical theories recrystallisation occurs as a smooth process of grain growth. The time step map shows that the movement is actually jerky: the <b>recrystallising</b> front jumps from one stopping position to the next. Chapter 5 describes and discusses the results of the in-situ observation of moving grain boundaries during recrystallisation of AA 3103. The stopping position of the <b>recrystallising</b> front is not immediately related to misorientation gradients between the subgrains and the new recrystallised grain, but is certainly influenced by both the constituent and the dispersoid particles. In analysing the observations the jerkiness of the movement is attributed to the local balance between driving and pinning forces. Jerkiness can be influenced by the deformation structure, the misorientation changes along the recrystallisation path, crystal defects, geometrical and curvature configurations and most of all precipitates. Once pinned the grain boundary can be released only if the pinning power decreases, i. e. if the particles coarsen. The concept leading to grain boundary jerkiness proposed in chapter 5 is analysed analytically and numerically in chapter 6. Jerkiness is related to local variations of subgrain size, misorientation, particle size, and volume fraction, but the most important parameter is the spatial distribution of particles. This Monte Carlo model was shown to be capable to describe local boundary motion for both smooth and jerky regimes. Simulations using experimental data to create the initial input microstructure, fit the experimental observations both quantitatively and qualitatively and lend credence to the proposed new theory for grain boundary jerkiness. www. mcmDelft. n...|$|E

At present, the tools available to characterize solid-solid systems cannot provide atomic level resolution of, for example mixed screw-edge dislocations. Therefore atomistic simulation can provide an invaluable complement to experiment. In this work atomistic simulation was employed to generate models of oxide thin films. First an atom deposition methodology was used to create an SrO thin film on a BaO(001) support. The evolution of the thin film from small clusters (submonolayer coverage), to five atomic layers, which includes cracks in its structure, was studied. Specifically, information related to growth and nucleation processes can be explored using this methodology. Secondly an amorphisation and recrystallisation methodology was developed to explore the more complex system, that of ceria deposited on zirconia and yttrium stabilized zirconia. Simulated amorphisation and recrystallisation involves forcing the thin film to undergo a transformation into an amorphous state prior to <b>recrystallising</b> and therefore the recrystallisation process rather than the (perhaps artificial) initial structure will dictate the final structure. The recrystallisation process enables the evolution of all the important structural modifications as the thin film evolves structurally {{in response to the}} support.

The rare earth element (REE) and U/Th composition of fossil bones reflects associated pore water compositions during theperiod of recrystallisation. The REE composition of fossil bones is controlled by partitioning of REE between pore waters and particlesurfaces, and the REE composition of fossil bones reflects the REE composition of pore waters which vary spatially and temporally. Light REE are preferentially sorped onto particle surfaces, thus the high La/Yb values seen in many bones from coastal marine and aeolian environments are best explained by release of REE from light REE-enriched particles to local pore waters and subsequent immobilisation in <b>recrystallising</b> bones. The REE compositions of bones recovered from pedogenically altered diatomite sediments of the Olorgesailie Formation of southern Kenya vary over spatial scales of less than 10 m.

It is known that elements of the microstructure in plastically deformed rocks, such as subgrains and <b>recrystallised</b> grains, are potentially useful as indicators of past deformation conditions in the Earth. The general aims {{of this study are}} (i) to establish novel methods that allow a quantitative description of microstructures in materials showing complex, heterogeneous microstructures and (ii) to analyse deformation mechanisms and the relationship between elements of the microstructure and deformation conditions, such that microstructures in geological materials can be used as indicators of (palaeo-) deformation conditions. The material of this study consists of samples of calcite experimentally deformed for different conditions: natural strain (0. 15 - 0. 90), stress (15 - 85 MPa) and temperature (700 - 900 C). Calcite is an important rock forming material often involved in crustal deformation zones and has heterogeneous microstructures consisting of <b>recrystallised</b> and deformed grains, the latter having grain boundary bulges and containing mantle and core subgrains. Grain boundary bulges and <b>recrystallised</b> grains are shown to be independent of strain. The <b>recrystallised</b> grain and bulge size show an inverse stress dependency, which can be affected by temperature (especially at high stress). The bulge size – stress dependency is suggested to be related to pinning of grain boundaries by sub-boundaries, and/or differences in driving forces for migration. The <b>recrystallised</b> grain size – stress dependency is related to the stress dependency of the bulges, because the <b>recrystallised</b> grains nucleate at grain boundary bulges. It is found that the mantle subgrain size has already become dynamically stable at low strain (0. 15). It is suggested that this is related to a balance between formation and ‘growth’ processes (subgrain boundary migration and subgrain coalescence). In contrast, the core subgrain size decreases with increasing strain and is linked to the deformed grain size. A mechanistic model based on slip system activation and stress intensification at grain boundaries in polycrystalline materials is proposed to explain the development of core mantle substructures. The core subgrains originally are formed by single slip and are not only dependent on stress, but also on grain size, strain and temperature. The low angle mantle subgrains are formed by slip on more than one slip system. They have a low stress sensitivity, which is probably related to cross-slip as a deformation mechanism and/or geometrically necessary dislocations accumulating in the mantle. In contrast, high angle mantle subgrains mainly consist of ‘bulge subgrains’ that are relatively more stress sensitive due to their origin by bulge rotation. Based on the stress sensitivities of the <b>recrystallised</b> grain size, bulge size, core and mantle subgrain sizes, suggestions are made for the use of such elements of the microstructures for palaeopiezometric purposes. It is found that high angle mantle subgrains, bulges and <b>recrystallised</b> grains are the most sensitive to stress and therefore most useful indicators of stress. For the application of <b>recrystallised</b> grains for palaeopiezometry, care should be taken especially at high stress because of the effect of temperature on the <b>recrystallised</b> grain size...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{growth and}} {{formation}} of polythiophene nanowires (NWs) was studied using {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM), UV-Vis spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). This {{was followed by the}} successful development of a novel technique for doping the nanowires, which led to the doped NWs being investigated in the active blend of organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Finally exploratory work was carried out on the feasibility of NWs as humidity and octylamine sensors, and as the semiconducting medium in water-gated organic field-effect transistors (WGOFETs). AFM revealed that the NWs were formed typically with heights of 1 10 nm, widths of 20 80 nm, and lengths exceeding 10 μm. The dimensions and the rate of growth of the NWs were affected by the polymer-solvent combination. XRD of the poly(3 -hexylthiophene- 2, 5 ’-diyl) (P 3 HT) NWs suggested a structure that is in agreement with that of P 3 HT films found in the literature. There is vertical stacking of the alkyl-chains in the NWs, p- stacking of the thiophene chains along the long axis of the wires and the polymer back bones lie perpendicular to the length of the wire. It was seen that the NWs possessed a more compact alkyl chain stacking than the P 3 HT films. In situ thermal annealing of the NWs led to expansion of the alkyl chain stacking, an increase in domain sizes and a decrease in paracrstallinity. Poly(3, 3 ”’-didodecyl-quarter-thiophene) (PQT- 12) NWs displayed a meta-stable structure as cast, turning amorphous above 100 °C, and <b>recrystallising</b> during cooling. Photoluminescence (PL) and combustion analysis provided indirect evidence to suggest successful intercalation of anthraquinone based dye molecules into P 3 HT and PQT- 12 NWs during the growth phase, which is a novel and facile doping technique. Dye-intercalated P 3 HT-NW:PCBM OPVs showed an increase in power conversion efficiency (PCE) and open circuit voltage (VOC), and a decrease in short-circuit density (JSC) for one dye (2 d) where the HOMO was deeper than that of both P 3 HT and PCBM. Octylamine and humidity chemiresistor sensors were successfully fabricated from P 3 HT NWs. The chemiresistors showed an increase in resistance upon exposure to as little as 3. 6 ppm of octyl-amine, and a 13 -fold increase in resistance at 36 ppm.

Throughout this thesis, solution-based synthesis methods {{are used to}} fabricate MNPs {{with a variety of}} shapes, from spheres and cubes to wires and octapods. Chapter 3 assesses the role of polyol solvent in autoclave-based magnetite NP synthesis. It was found that solvents containing functional groups (especially primary alcohols) afforded the greatest control over final MNP morphology and that the presence of additional alkyl substituents could disrupt the packing of surfactant molecules around a particle surface, giving rise to more complex ‘compound’ MNPs. Magnetic measurements show the particles to be superparamagnetic, with saturation magnetisation values close to that of the bulk. In Chapter 4 It was found that by replacing the polyol solvents used in Chapter 3 with a large excess of bulky surfactant molecules it was possible to form high aspect ratio lanthanide oxide (LnOx) nanowires and ribbons. It was found that the nanowires formed via an intriguing 3 -stage ‘oriented assembly’ mechanism, in which individual NPs form, before aligning anisotropically and <b>recrystallising</b> into a more crystallographically homogeneous product. The magnetic properties of Gd 2 O 3 nanowires and Dy 2 O 3 nanoribbons are very similar to those of discrete particles, implying that no long-range ordering exists in the nanowires. Optical characterisation of the Eu 2 O 3 nanowires showed that there is an increase in fluorescence lifetime going from bulk Eu 2 O 3 to the nanoscale. In Chapter 5 the high temperature reflux approach is used in the synthesis of manganese oxide (as MnO) particles, using manganese-containing polynuclear carboxylate complexes as precursors. It was found that control over MnO NP size and shape is dependent on many factors, such as the carboxylate ligand present in the precursor (which can disrupt particle stabilisation by surfactant molecules) and the heating regime, which ii determines if the particles grow under thermodynamic or kinetic growth regimes. The magnetic behaviour of MnO MNPs was found to be dependent on the relative number of surface spins present in the particles. In Chapter 6 new routes to gadolinium-doped magnetite particles are discussed. It was found that decomposition of a single-source precursor yielded doped magnetite particles which had a gadolinium content of 2 – 4 %. Magnetic characterisation of these particles showed them to be superparamagnetic, with a reduced saturation magnetisation compared to bulk magnetite. Preliminary investigations showed that the gadolinium doped particles (after being rendered water soluble by a ligand exchange reaction) were readily taken up by human fibroblast cells and exhibited low toxicities...|$|E
40|$|The {{annealing}} behaviour, including {{studies of}} recrystallisation kinetics {{and development of}} crystallographic texture, of two low carbon steels after different cold rolling reductions have been investigated using Optical Microscopy (OM), Electron Back-Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The primary recrystallisation behaviour of 20, 50, 70 and 90 % cold rolled Interstitial Free (IF) and High Strength Low Alloy (HSLA) steels was studied. The HSLA was initially processed to give a volume fraction of about 0. 2 of fine pearlite colonies, which acted as mechanically hard particles. The presence of such particles on the HSLA steel significantly reduced the temperature needed for recrystallisation by enhancing the recrystallisation and acting as nucleation sites by the Particle Stimulated Nucleation (PSN) mechanism. The inhomogeneous deformation and the local orientation changes introduced in the neighbourhood of the carbide particles (i. e. the particle deformation zone) were observed using TEM and selected area electron diffraction. The JMAK model was used to analyse the recrystallisation kinetics of the two steels. The experimental data plotted according to the JMAK model could be represented by straight lines with a JMAK exponent n falling {{in the range from}} 1. 4 to 2. 0. The development of crystallographic textures after cold rolling reductions and subsequent recrystallisation has been investigated. The texture development is shown to be largely dependent on the rolling reduction. With increasing rolling reduction, the annealing texture show gradual intensification of α- and γ-fibre components. However, the intensity of both fibres is weaker in the HSLA steel. Despite the dominance of PSN in HSLA steel, the recrystallisation textures were {{similar to that of the}} rolling textures with weaker intensity of both fibres. To help clarify the reasons for that, in-situ EBSD experiments of <b>recrystallising</b> HSLA steel deformed to 50 % and 70 % have been carried out. It shows that the formation of the nucleus seems to occur within the deformation zones in regions away from the particle surface leading to recrystallisation textures similar to that of the rolling textures (i. e. both α- and γ-fibre exist). The validity of this assumption has been confirmed by the use of Monte Carlomodelling. This model was used to simulate, in general way, and study the phenomenon of PSN during the recrystallisation process. The simulation shows the discontinuous evolution of the subgrains in the deformation zone to form recrystallisation nuclei around the particle. It shows also the subsequent growth of these nuclei to consume the matrix region around the particle. The simulation results are shown to match with the experimentally observed features of the recrystallisation phenomena in low carbon steel containing coarse cementite particles.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this work has been to develop aluminium alloys, which after hot and cold deformation are able to withstand high temperatures without <b>recrystallising.</b> This {{has been done by}} investigating aluminium alloys with various additions of hafnium, scandium and zirconium, with a main focus on Hf and to which extent it may partly substitute or replace Zr and/or Sc as a dispersoid forming elements in these alloys. What is the effect of hafnium, alone and in combination with Zr and/or Sc and how do hafnium containing alloys perform? It is shown that hafnium may alter or modify the casting structure, though, not to the better as it can form TCGs in combinations with Zr and/or Sc. This is not advantageous neither as far as it concerns grain refining nor precipitation of dispersoids. When precipitation of binary Al-Hf is compared to Al-(Hf) -(Zr) alloys, hafnium shows even slower precipitation than in Al-(Hf) -(Zr) alloys and also much slower and with a poorer spatial distribution of dispersoids than in Al-Sc or Al-Hf-Sc alloys. As a consequence, it may be concluded that binary aluminium-hafnium alloys are of limited interest as they display a poor recrystallisation resistance when no other alloying elements are added. However, when hafnium is added together with scandium and/or zirconium, precipitation may actually improve both in Al-Hf-Zr alloys and in scandium containing alloys like Al-Hf-Sc and Al-Hf-Sc-Zr. Hafnium can still not completely replace neither Zr nor Sc due to its poor precipitation properties. However, Al-Hf-Sc-Zr alloys show a better dispersoid distribution (number density and volume fraction) than what was observed in Al-Sc-Zr alloys after extrusion. The Al-Hf-Sc-Zr alloys also show extreme high temperature properties, by withstanding recrystallisation at high temperatures and long annealing times. After severe cold deformation, the extruded profiles of both the Al-Sc-Zr alloy and the Al-Hf-Sc-Zr alloy displayed a remarkable recrystallisation resistance. The reason why the Al-Zr-Sc- and the Al-Hf-Zr-Sc alloys behave so well has been investigated by detailed 3 D Atom Probe investigations. Due to the homogeneous precipitation of Al 3 Sc dispersoids and the retarding effect from Hf and/or Zr containing shells, thus limiting the coarsening of these dispersoids, these combinations have been shown successful. As we have seen when Hf and Zr are added in combination equal or improved recrystallisation properties can be obtained. This is specially the case when both these elements are added together with scandium. Since Hf and Zr are extremely difficult (and thus costly) to separate, Al-Zr master alloys used in industry today can in the future probably contain more Hf, lowering the cost of master alloys. The work presented in this thesis have hopefully added some new insight and {{a better understanding of the}} effects of adding various dispersoid forming elements to aluminium, alone and in various combinations, which may be useful for industry today and a basis for further alloy development.

40|$|Reservoir quality {{relates to}} the {{presence}} of porosity and the connectivity of the pores of the reservoir rock which controls permeability. Deeply buried sandstones in sedimentary basins lose their reservoir quality due to compaction and cementation. Quartz cement is the most volumetrically important porosity occluding cement in sandstones buried to depths greater than about 3000 m. Precipitation of quartz cement requires a source of silica, transportation of the silica in solution from source to the point of precipitation and clean grain surfaces to grow on. For these processes to take place water is required to dissolve the mineral grains that provide the source of silica, to provide aqueous fluid pathway from the site of mineral dissolution to the site of precipitation and water is required at the site of mineral precipitation to enable mineral growth. In oil or gas fields, displacing the aqueous pore fluid by petroleum disrupts the pathway between the reactants and points of precipitation. If the oil saturation becomes high; (i) the residual (irreducible) water becomes isolated within a continuous hydrocarbon phase or (ii) the aqueous pathway becomes tortuous and diffusion becomes slow or (iii) grain surfaces become coated by oil if the sandstone is oil wet. However, over the years a controversy has developed as to whether oil emplacement into reservoir stops quartz cementation and preserves porosity at depth. The research presented in this thesis used core samples, wireline logs and well reports collected from the oil and water legs and the transition zone of Upper Jurassic marine sandstones of the Ula and Tambar fields from the Norwegian North Sea. They were studied using a range of techniques: core analysis, core logging, downhole wireline analysis, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscope (SEM), cathodoluminescence (CL), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fluid inclusion UV-petrology and thermometry. The distributions of all potential controls on porosity and permeability have been quantified so that it has been possible to assess the influence of all possible controls on quartz cement as well as fluid type. Thus the roles of depositional facies, grain size, sorting, chlorite coats and microcrystalline quartz coats have all been assessed. The main diagenetic cements in both Ula and Tambar fields are quartz overgrowths, grain coating microcrystalline quartz, K-feldspar cement, illite, dolomite and minor amounts of calcite and chlorite. Fluid inclusion evidence shows that quartz cementation was probably a continuous process and is still taking place in both fields. Quartz cementation occurred in the presence of some oil, as shown by the presence of oil inclusions within quartz cement in both Ula and Tambar. However, there are far fewer oil inclusions in quartz cement in Tambar than Ula suggesting that oil emplacement occurred later in Tambar than Ula. There is less quartz cement in the coarser grained sandstones in the oil legs than the water legs of Ula and Tambar suggesting that quartz cementation has been inhibited, in these facies, by the addition of oil. Finer-grained facies in both fields have more grain-coating microcrystalline quartz that has effectively inhibited quartz cementation in both oil and water legs. Stable isotope data show that the carbonate cements in the oil leg grew at relatively lower temperatures than those in the water legs. Precipitation temperature for carbonate cement in the oil leg stopped at the time of oil emplacement but carbonate cements in the water leg carried on growing or <b>recrystallising</b> at higher temperatures and show progressive input of source-rock derived CO 2 (as the carbon isotopes get progressively lighter) in both Ula and Tambar fields. Reservoir quality in the Ula field is primarily controlled by a combination of depositional facies, mechanical compaction and early oil emplacement and locally by facies-controlled microcrystalline quartz. In the Tambar field early-formed grain-coating microcrystalline quartz mainly controls the reservoir quality and effects of oil emplacement are not as significant as in Ula due to the later oil charge. The results of this work have academic and economic significance. Understanding the controls on reservoir quality and the effect of oil emplacement on quartz cementation may be used (1) as analogues in other basins of known petroleum charge history, (2) to improve appropriate reserve calculation and well planning during the appraisal stage and (3) to assist in reliable prediction of aquifer performance during production, and lead to proper decision on number and positions of injection wells during the later life of the field...|$|E
40|$|The Hellyer zinc-lead-silver {{deposit of}} western Tasmania {{is a well}} {{preserved}} example of a volcanic-hosted massive sulphide. The deposit is hosted by intermediate-basic lavas and volcaniclastics of the Que-Hellyer Volcanics, the uppermost volcanic unit of the Cambrian Mt. Read Volcanics. The complete deposit, including the footwall alteration stringer zone, is preserved. The current complex morphology of the massive sulphide {{is due to the}} combination of primacy depositional irregularities, ductile Devonian folding and brittle Mesozoic faulting. Statistical analysis of available mine sample assays and subsequent geostatistical 3 D grade modelling has revealed a classic metal zonation pattern. Whilst Cu and Fe are enriched towards the footwall, proximal to the central feeder zone recognised by Gemmell and Large (1992); Zn, Pb, Ag, Au, As and Ba are gradually enriched towards the distal hangingwall. The current observed metal distribution is interpreted to be substantially the same as the Cambrian distribution; Devonian deformation resulted in only very local remobilisation. Spatial analysis of macroscopic textures has shown a clear zonation, similar to the geometry of the metal distribution. Massive sulphide proximal to the central feeder zone is strongly recrystallised, but grades upwards and outwards to a featureless, massive texture and fmally to strongly banded ores at the hangingwall contact. A very detailed microtextural study of 174 polished thin sections was completed from samples selected on a 3 D grid through {{the central part of the}} deposit. Two hundred and twenty-two different microscopic textures have been recognised, with their spatial occurrence and features documented in a comprehensive atlas. These textures have been placed into paragenetic groups ranging through early primitive deposition, in situ recrystallisation, intra-mound veining, upwards redeposition, thermal retraction, Devonian and Mesozoic deformation-related, and fmally, surface weathering. These paragenetic groups are zoned, similar to the metal zoning and macroscopic textures, around the central feeder in the footwall. Various depositional and recrystallisation processes are postulated in an overall model for textural evolution. Microprobe analyses of the major minerals from numerous samples have shown variation according to texture and position within the overall orebody zonation. Significantly, pyrite shows considerable reduction in trace element content as crystallinity increases towards the proximal base of the sulphide mound. Early sphalerite has a higher Fe content than the late varieties, early tetrahedrite has a higher Ag content than later generations and carbonates show increasing CaO content and decreasing FeO content passing from early to late textural types. Other minerals show more complex compositional variability. The classic metal and texture zonation patterns, together with evidence from detailed microprobe analysis lend support to a mound refining genetic model, similar to that proposed by Eldridge et al. (1983) for the Kuroko volcanic·hosted massive sulphide deposits. The Hellyer genetic model postulates that a hydrothermal system was focussed at the intersection of a normal graben fault with a transfer fault on the Cambrian seafloor. These faults tapped a deep heat source and as temperature increased, rising hot solutions saturated with base and precious metals and reduced sulphur, began to vent into the cold, oxygenated seawater. Initially, barite/anhydrite and cherty crusts were deposited on the seafloor overlying the core of the footwall alteration zone. These crusts, by partly capping the system, allowed higher temperature deposition of primitive melnikovite pyrite and sphalerite/wurtzite, by replacement of pre-existing sulphates, and within voids, just below the mound surface. As the mound grew, these depositional processes moved upwards and outwards, away from the central feeder. Much higher temperatures in the lower part of the mound, gradually recrystallised and refined the primitive pyrite, expelling contaminant trace elements to be redeposited in higher, cooler parts of the mound. The growing mound became unstable, depositing clastic massive sulphide in adjacent basins that were eventually enveloped by the expanding higher temperature hydrothermal system, <b>recrystallising</b> and partially destroying the original fragmental framework. When the mound reached its ultimate extent, rotation of the stress regime closed off access to the heat and fluid sources and temperatures in the system decreased. As volcaniclastic mass flows and pillow lavas buried and preserved the deposit, the waning phase led to further deposition oflower temperature mineralisation, increasingly deeper within the mound in available voids. Devonian deformation annealed and extended the ductile sphalerite· galena rich distal hangingwall zones and introduced tensile pull apart fractures in the more proximal pyritic zones. All minerals, except pyrite, were locally remobilised into newly created voids. Mesozoic brittle wrench faulting brecciated pyritic areas causing minor remobilisation of minerals into late narrow cracks that cut across all earlier textural features...|$|E
