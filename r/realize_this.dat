25|$|Divine Science, Unity Church, and Religious Science are {{organizations}} that {{developed from the}} New Thought movement. Each teaches that Infinite Intelligence, or God, is the sole reality.

25|$|The {{contemporary}} {{theory of}} false necessity attempts to <b>realize</b> <b>this</b> idea in its entirety, and {{to escape the}} limitations of liberal and Marxist theories. It aims to realize social plasticity by decoupling human freedom from any necessary social rules or historical trajectory. The theory recognizes the need for social rules, but also affirms the human potential to transcend them. Humanity need not be constrained by any structure.|$|E
25|$|Chanting usually {{centers on}} major bodhisattvas like Avalokiteśvara (see Guanyin) and Manjushri. According to Mahayana Buddhism, bodhisattvas are beings {{who have taken}} vows to remain in saṃsāra to help all beings achieve liberation from it. Since the Zen practitioner's aim is to walk the bodhisattva path, {{chanting}} {{can be used as}} a means to connect with these beings and <b>realize</b> <b>this</b> ideal within oneself.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} Berlin Observatory, {{originally}} built outside the border of the town, was enclosed by blocks of flats, so scientific observations were almost impossible. Therefore, Foerster proposed the removal of the observatory to a place outside Berlin with better observational conditions. In 1904 he appointed Karl Hermann Struve, former director of the observatory of Königsberg, as his successor to <b>realize</b> <b>this</b> project.|$|E

25|$|Most {{vehicles}} {{require only}} generalist maintenance, where any competent mechanic can properly maintain the vehicle. Certain vehicles — like Citroëns and Ferraris — require specialist care {{due to their}} unique design. While a sturdy car if maintained rigorously, the SM did require two sets of specialist care — Citroën specialists, which are widespread in Europe, and a rarer Maserati specialist, to keep the engine in tune.

25|$|The {{immigrants}} {{founded the}} First Parish Church of Dorchester in 1631, which exists {{today as the}} Unitarian-Universalist church on Meeting House Hill, being the oldest religious organization in present-day Boston. The first church building was a simple log cabin with a thatched roof. The settlers held their first town meeting at the church, and they set their laws in open and frequent discussion. In all of this they were inspired by {{the ideal of the}} Kingdom of God on earth and the attempt to <b>realize</b> <b>this</b> in England in the time of the Rev. John White. The church is referred to as a 'Foundation Stone of the Nation".|$|E
25|$|According to one tradition, {{before meeting}} his patron Hajji Zayn al-Attar, Hafez {{had been working}} in a bakery, {{delivering}} bread to a wealthy quarter of the town. There, he first saw Shakh-e Nabat, a woman of great beauty, to whom some of his poems are addressed. Ravished by her beauty but knowing that his love for her would not be requited, he allegedly held his first mystic vigil in his desire to <b>realize</b> <b>this</b> union. Still, he encountered a being of surpassing beauty who identified himself as an angel, and his further attempts at union became mystic; a pursuit of spiritual union with the divine. A Western parallel is that of Dante and Beatrice.|$|E

25|$|Supporters {{believe that}} this plan will be an {{important}} part of what Bush set in place while in office. However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding {{over the next five years}} that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from NASA's other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully <b>realize</b> <b>this</b> vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term.|$|E
25|$|The {{song was}} {{originally}} {{featured in the}} 1991 feature film The Five Heartbeats, which follows {{the lives of the}} fictional singing group of the same name. In the scene the song is featured in, the group is about to perform in a Battle of the Bands when the announcer, a cousin of another musician in the competition, tells them backstage that a new house rule demands they use a piano player hired by the owners of the building. The members of the group have not practiced with the piano player, and quickly <b>realize</b> <b>this</b> will harm their performance. The announcer then goads the audience into booing and throwing objects at the Heartbeats as they perform. Duck, tired of his music being altered, throws the piano player off the stage and plays in his own style. The crowd soon applauds as The Heartbeats perform together and the group wins the contest.|$|E
25|$|Folk {{religions}} and animists {{with a deep}} concern {{for the preservation of}} their traditional ancestor religions declared their religion to be Hinduism, considering it a more flexible option than Islam, in the outer islands. In the early seventies, the Toraja people of Sulawesi were the first to <b>realize</b> <b>this</b> opportunity by seeking shelter for their indigenous ancestor religion under the broad umbrella of 'Hinduism', followed by the Karo Batak of Sumatra in 1977. In central and southern Kalimantan, a large Hindu movement has grown among the local indigenous Dayak population which lead to a mass declaration of 'Hinduism' on this island in 1980. However, this was different from the Javanese case, in that conversions followed a clear ethnic division. Indigenous Dayak were confronted with a mostly Muslim population of government-sponsored (and predominantly Madurese) migrants and officials, and deeply resentful at the dispossession of their land and its natural resources.|$|E

25|$|When we {{point out}} the need of {{opposing}} Trotskyism we discover a very strange phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense {{in the ranks of}} certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. We saw this on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; we saw this clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And everybody will <b>realize</b> <b>this</b> when the trial opens against the P.O.U.M. leaders who were caught spying. And we realize that the hand of Fascism is behind every attempt to demoralize our home front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it is essential that we wipe out Trotskyism with a firm hand, for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.|$|E
500|$|Having {{been struck}} by the {{cinematic}} qualities of Sondheim's musical while still a student, Burton had entertained {{the notion of a}} film version since the early 1980s. However, it was not until 2006 that he had the opportunity to <b>realize</b> <b>this</b> ambition, when DreamWorks announced his appointment as replacement for director Sam Mendes, who had been working on such an adaptation. Sondheim, although not directly involved, was extensively consulted during production. Depp, not known for his singing, took lessons in preparation for his role, which producer Richard D. Zanuck acknowledged was something [...] of a gamble. However, Depp's vocal performance, despite being criticized as lacking certain musical qualities, was generally thought by critics to suit the part.|$|E
500|$|Constructing the {{machinery}} to <b>realize</b> <b>this</b> vision was complicated. Evans {{struggled to find}} {{the money to pay}} the highly skilled carpenters needed to construct his complex machines. The nearby flour milling industry on the Brandywine River was large, but dominated by the Quaker millers of Wilmington who saw little potential in Evans's designs. James Latimer, a Newport flour merchant upon hearing Evans's ideas exclaimed [...] "Ah! Oliver, you cannot make water run uphill, you cannot make wooden millers!" [...] Latimer's son, George, however once more saw the promise in Evans's ideas and helped him to secure patent protection over the inventions throughout 1787 and 1788. By this time Evans converted his brothers' mill at Red Clay Creek into a fully automated prototype based on his perfected designs, and the Evans brothers sent handbills and diagrams to the major milling centers of the United States offering free licensing of the designs for the first miller in each county who would commission Evans to refit their mills. Yet this campaign was to prove a major disappointment, and little commercial interest materialized.|$|E
