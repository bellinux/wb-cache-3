3000|$|Interestingly, {{within such}} a conception, the {{solution}} to the problem of suffering cannot be to condemn either dharma or fate. Kṛṣṇa describes this attitude as anāryajuṣṭam asvargyam (Bhagavadgītā 2.2), that is, ignoble and not leading to heaven. Rather, the solution is to dehisce from the world and realize one’s identity with the Self. This knowledge, called guhyam adhyātmam in the Gītā (Bhagavadgītā 11.1), is known as anugraha or grace, rather than a simple promise of salvation. When Hudson describes suffering as a “universal truth,” we must ask: <b>From</b> whose <b>perspective?</b> <b>From</b> the <b>perspective</b> of the Self? <b>From</b> the <b>perspective</b> of the world?
