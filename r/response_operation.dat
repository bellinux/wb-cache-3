On 2 November, al Sabha, close to the DMZ, was attacked, in Operation Volcano (Mivtza Ha Ga'ash), killing 81 Egyptian soldiers. On 11 December, hoping an attack on Syria would provoke an Egyptian <b>response,</b> <b>Operation</b> Olive Leaves/Sea of Galilee (Mivtza 'Alei Zayit/Kinneret) was launched in which a number of Syrian positions {{on the eastern shore}} of the Sea of Galilee were destroyed.

25|$|In {{response}} to the increasing oil transportation in the Gulf of Finland, the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA) chartered Kontio for the summer months and fitted her with oil recovery equipment {{at a cost of}} 2.2 million euro. The contract, signed on 17 November 2009, was valid for three years starting from 24 July 2010 and had an option of another three years. In April 2013, the option was utilized and the contract was extended by three years. According to the contract, Kontio would remain in constant readiness in the icebreaker base at Katajanokka, Helsinki. During the winter months, she resumed her escort icebreaker duties in the Gulf of Bothnia but maintained a preparedness for oil spill <b>response</b> <b>operation</b> in ice-covered waters.|$|E

The length and quality of care, significant factors for reducing the negative social and economic impacts in humanitarian operations in an emergency, are significantly influenced by the degree of excellence in logistics operations. Thus, this study aims in synthesizing the logistics concepts applied {{to disaster}} <b>response</b> <b>operations</b> and their evaluation in order to contribute with a methodology that can be applied in these situations in Brazil. Therefore, through the analysis of seven documents focused on the application of logistics concepts in disaster <b>response</b> <b>operations</b> and of several publications on the field of humanitarian logistics, was possible to identify a set of logistics processes and actions which are related to the success of disaster <b>response</b> <b>operations.</b> In order to structure such actions, it was developed a framework, aimed at the application in the field of disaster <b>response</b> <b>operations</b> in Brazil...|$|R

The MARO Project is based on the insight that the failure to act in the face of mass killings of civilians is not simply a function of political will or legal authority; the failure also reflects a lack of thinking about how military forces might respond. States and regional and international organizations must better understand and prepare for the unique operational and moral challenges that military forces would face in a MARO.|$|E
