40|$|Previous {{studies in}} the nuclear weapons complex have shown that {{ambiguous}} work instructions (WIs) and operating procedures (OPs) can lead to human error, which is a major cause for concern. This report outlines some {{of the sources of}} ambiguity in written English and describes three recommendations for reducing ambiguity in WIs and OPs. The recommendations are based on commonly used research techniques in the fields of linguistics and cognitive psychology. The first recommendation is to gather empirical data {{that can be used to}} improve the <b>recommended</b> <b>word</b> lists that are provided to technical writers. The second recommendation is to have a review in which new WIs and OPs and checked for ambiguities and clarity. The third recommendation is to use self-paced reading time studies to identify any remaining ambiguities before the new WIs and OPs are put into use. If these three steps are followed for new WIs and OPs, the likelihood of human errors related to ambiguity could be greatly reduced...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The Advent of multi-cores allows {{programs}} {{to be executed}} much faster than before. Cryptoalgorithms use long-bit words thus parallelizing these operations on multi-cores will achieve significant performance improvement. However, not all long-bit word operations in cryptosystems are suitable for parallel execution on multi-cores. In particular, long-bit words used in Elliptic Curves Cryptography (ECC) do not efficiently divide by the system word size. This causes some of the cores to be idle, which makes it vulnerable for attackers to guess how many operations occurred and thus what field size is being used. Multiplication {{is the most important}} part of public key cryptosystems. Long-bit word multiplication operations are needed for encryption and decryption. J. Fan et al. proposed using Montgomery multiplication on multi-cores using GF(2 ²⁵⁶) [25, 26], which is suitable for comput-er systems with 16 -bit or 32 -bit word size. Fan‟s Montgomery multiplication is suitable for most RSA. However, in ECC, some GFs will cause idle cores. For example, suppose GF(2 ¹³¹) is used (which is one of the <b>recommended</b> <b>word</b> size by NIST) on a quad-core with a 32 -bit word size, which requires [132 / 32] = 5 iterations with the last iteration requiring just a 3 -bit operation. This cause three of the cores to be idle during this time causing needless power consumption. The most general and the easiest way to make side channel attacks difficult is to insert dummy instructions to cover the idle processors. However, dummy instructions result in extra workloads that lead to performance degradation and increases in power consumption. In this thesis, we will present a multiplier adjuster technique to improve the execution time and the power consumption for the last unbalanced iteration. By appropriately applying dummy instructions between point-addition and point-doubling operations, a balanced point operation can be achieved in ECC. The performance and power-efficiency of the proposed method on multi-cores are analyzed for each GF used in ECC...|$|E

S. {{grandparents}} {{are responsible}} for providing parental care, {{in the absence of}} the biological parent, for at least one grandchild under the age of 18 years. These caregivers may base their wellness and nutrition practices with their grandchildren on outdated advice. In 2010, Kansas State University Human Nutrition Cooperative Extension Service faculty launched a theory-based newsletter, entitled Nourishing the Next Generation, that was mailed six times per year to low-income grandparent caregivers, and posted on a public website (at [URL] Each issue disseminated small amounts of practical, specific, “how-to” nutrition- and wellness-related information that addressed topics identified as being of concern to this population and that used <b>recommended</b> <b>word</b> choice, format, and design principles. After five years of Nourishing the Next Generation being in circulation, we surveyed readers who had received it from one to five years in order to assess the impact it had and to highlight its strengths. This study combined qualitative and quantitative approaches by using written surveys with both open- and closed-ended questions. Two different types of participants who had received the newsletter, grandparent caregivers and community educators, received surveys. A total of 54 valid surveys were returned from the 492 that were sent to grandparent caregivers, while 30 out of 175 community educators completed surveys. The newsletter was perceived by responding grandparent caregivers to be very effective in improving their awareness, knowledge, motivation, and confidence to follow recommendations about healthy eating and physical activity. Also, reading it led to many self-reported positive changes in various nutrition, physical activity, and other wellness practices among 91 percent of the responding grandparent caregivers and their families. In addition, 70 percent of responding community educators used its contents extensively to disseminate information to wider audiences. In conclusion, including grandparent caregivers in wellness-related educational programs could be a good approach to target healthy lifestyle practices of both older and younger generations. An appropriately designed newsletter can effectively improve the health of a large number of people, yet has limited costs, and thus, is an excellent public health method...|$|E

In contrast to previous work, we only query the user when information is most needed and good suggestions are available. We verify the efficacy of our approach using geographical, temporal and semantic metadata, and a user study.

Two experiments were conducted to assess the veracity of this assumption. In Experiment 1, participants memorised single words or word pairs, or categorised them as natural or man made. Their free recall protocols were examined to assess any associations established between successively presented items. Fewest associations were observed when the item-specific encoding task (i. e., natural or man made categorisation of word referents) was applied to single words. These findings were examined further in Experiment 2, where the influence of encoding instructions and stimulus presentation on local EC dependent recognition memory was examined.
