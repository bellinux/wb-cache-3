40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the reliability of}} <b>regional</b> three-dimensional <b>registration</b> and superimposition methods for assessment of temporomandibular joint condylar morphology across subjects and longitudinally. Methods: The sample consisted of cone beam CT scans of 36 patients. The across-subject comparisons included 12 controls, mean age 41. 3 +/- 12. 0 years, and 12 patients with temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis, mean age 41. 3 +/- 14. 7 years. The individual longitudinal assessments included 12 patients with temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis, mean age 37. 8 +/- 16. 7 years, followed up at pre-operative jaw surgery, immediately after and one-year post-operative. Surface models of all condyles were constructed from the cone beam CT scans. Two previously calibrated observers independently performed all registration methods. A landmark-based approach {{was used for the}} registration of across-subject condylar models, and temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis vs control group differences were computed with shape analysis. A voxel-based approach was used for registration of longitudinal scans calculated x, y, z degrees of freedom for translation and rotation. Two-way random intraclass correlation coefficients tested the interobserver reliability. Results: Statistically significant differences between the control group and the osteoarthritis group were consistently located on the lateral and medial poles for both observers. The interobserver differences were 0. 75).

40|$|International audienceStatistical Shape Models (SSMs) are {{efficient}} {{tools in}} several fields and especially medical applications. In {{order to be}} meaningful, SSM construction requires a dense correspondence matching between {{a significant number of}} objects, which remains a very challenging task. Nonrigid registration is an essential element in the SSM construction pipeline that allows establishing correspondences between shapes and capturing their local variations. We introduce the <b>Regional</b> Affine <b>Registration</b> (RAR) that is based on object segmentation where each region is affinely registered to its counterpart. The point-based RAR process can be used to initiate a farther nonrigid registration process. Experiments are performed using fiducial metrics to compare three registration approaches: RAR, segmentation-based, and classical approach. As an application, we integrate RAR in the construction of an SSM of the human scapula. The three approaches are used to match correspondences between 85 scapulae and a validation of the SSM is carried out by evaluating its compactness, generalization and specificity. Multilevel B-Spline nonrigid registration parameter optimization is also investigated in a feedback sense using an initial version of the model. The initial SSM is used to generate in-correspondence shapes, giving ground truth to optimization experiments. The RAR method proved to initiate better the nonrigid registration which gave more accurate correspondence among synthetic and real database shapes. This was also reflected in the SSM validation tests. We show that performing the nonrigid registration in an iterative manner did not necessarily improve the final result...|$|R

40|$|We propose and analyse a proxy-based <b>regional</b> <b>registration</b> {{scheme for}} {{integrated}} mobility and service management {{with the goal}} to minimize the network signaling and packet delivery cost in Mobile Internet Protocol (MIP) systems. Under the proposed proxy-based <b>regional</b> <b>registration</b> scheme, a client-side proxy is created on a per-user basis {{to serve as a}} gateway between a mobile node (MN) and all services engaged by the MN. From the perspective of these services, the proxy behaves {{as if it were the}} MN. From the perspective of the MN, the proxy behaves as if it were the services. Leveraging MIP with route optimization, the proxy runs on a foreign agent node and cooperates with the home agent and foreign agents of the MN in the MIP network to maintain the location information of the MN in order to facilitate data delivery by services engaged by the MN. Further the proxy can optimally determine when to move with the MN so as to minimize the network cost associated with the userâs mobility and service management. We investigate the notion of âservice areas â for the proxy to perform âservice handoffs â in our scheme. We show that, when given a set of parameters characterizing the operational and workload conditions of an MN, there exists an optimal service area size for the MN such that the network communication cost is minimized for serving mobility and service management operations of the MN.

40|$|The study {{examines}} {{the reasons for}} the differences in the mismatch-unemployment between different qualification groups in western Germany. In particular possible causes for the high level of mismatch within the group of the low-skilled with a disproportionate increase in the 1980 s and 1990 s are analysed in more detail. As by definition formal qualification requirements can not constitute barriers to entry to the labour market for the group of the low-skilled, qualification- specific mismatch can be ruled out as a cause. In addition no convincing indications of measurement-related reasons for this development are found. Thus differences between the qualification groups with regard to <b>regional</b> mismatch, the <b>registration</b> rate or the fluctuation on the labour market can be rejected as possible causes for the high level of mismatch within the group of the low-skilled. In contrast, differences do exist between the qualification groups with regard to labour-market-relevant personal characteristics and particularly with regard to mismatch associated with wages. Social-qualification and wage-related factors thus constitute the most plausible explanations for the high level of mismatch and its development within the group of the low-skilled.

40|$|Summary The incompleteness and {{inaccuracy}} {{of cancer}} registries, with the resulting underestimation of cancer incidence {{and lack of}} confidence by clinicians in the information offered, have been noted by numerous studies throughout the world. We report attempts in one district to provide more accurate and timely information on cancer cases, both for local purposes and for expediting input to the Regional Registry and hence the National Registry. A semi-automatic link between the pathology system and the PAS system was developed to establish a histopathology-based dataset of cancer cases for the district. This software provides a basis for cancer registration and, combined with clinical staging and treatment ranges, could provide a timely and accurate picture of cancer for research, management, treatment and planning purposes. There {{is no question that}} to provide reliable, complete and timely data on which to base District and hence <b>Regional</b> Cancer <b>Registration</b> is vital (Nwene & Smith, 1982). In attempting to answer enquiries at a local level from clinicians, epidemiologists and researchers about the occurrence of neoplastic disease in the District, it was clear not only that the existing cancer registry was in many cases unable to supply the information required, but also that much of the information needed was to be found in District-based computer systems, but in unlinked form. However, a major impediment was an apparent inability to link PAS data containing patient identifications details with Pathology data which identified the neoplasm and site. Others have noted the value of using a histopathologybased system to improve the completeness and accuracy of cancer registration. (Donnan et al., 1981). This would have the advantage of enabling details to be obtained of patients treated by private clinics, private hospitals and general practitioners. In addition, this would reduce the inaccuracy rates in site and histology coding, as up to ten per cent are transcription errors caused by CDC clerks in coding (Wes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Shivering during {{regional}} anesthesia is {{a common}} complication and is related to {{a decrease in the}} patientâs core body temperature. Previous studies have shown that acupuncture on specific acupoints can preserve core body temperature. The present study evaluated the effect of electroacupuncture in preventing the shivering caused by regional anesthesia. Methods This prospective and randomized controlled study analyzed the data from 80 patients undergoing urological surgery, who were classified as ASA I or II. Spinal anesthesia was performed in all patients using 15 [*]mg of bupivacaine. The patients were randomly allocated to receive either placebo acupuncture (Group P, n [*]=[*] 40) or electroacupuncture (Group A, n [*]=[*] 40) for 30 [*]min before administration of spinal anesthesia. Shivering score was recorded at 5 [*]min intervals, with 0 representing no shivering and 4 representing the most severe shivering possible. Heart rate, blood pressure, and tympanic temperature were recorded before the intrathecal injection, and again every 5 [*]min thereafter until 30 [*]min. Results After spinal anesthesia, the decrease in tympanic temperature was less for Group A patients than Group P, with the difference being statistically significant. After 15 [*]min, 13 patients in Group P attained a shivering score of 3 or more, compared with 3 patients in Group A. Significantly more patients in Group P attained a shivering score of at least 1.
