40|$|The {{coupling}} and decoupling of trains {{while they}} are in motion {{is one of the}} research fields of the DLR project Next Generation Train. The coupling will be non-mechanical, but virtual and will be maintained by means of distance control technology. A special challenge of the virtual coupling in railway operation is the peril point of the switch in case of failure during the passage of two trains which are coming from different tracks, running in close succession at high-speed. Therefore some concepts are unrealizable with the current switch technology. Nevertheless there are situations where virtual coupling seems promising. One scenario is the virtual coupling at low speed, e. g. in the proximity of a station, where a safe brake is possible in case of a switch failure. The “Shinkansen” scenario aims to increase line capacity on the Tokaido high-speed line in Japan between Tokio and Osaka. The fastest “Nozomi” trains are stopping only at major stations. These stations have two tracks per direction with a 400 m platform. The idea is to double the number of Nozomi trains. So in every stopping station, there are two trains arriving and departing in a short interval. The distance on the open line is not that close, so it is more a ride within <b>relative</b> <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> than a virtual coupling. To evaluate that scenario a special railway operation simulation has been developed, which is able to handle virtual coupling. The simulation shows the possibility to increase seating capacity from 15, 000 to 23, 000 seats per hour and direction. One bottleneck is occurring in Nagoya, where an additional platform is needed. Also the return time in Tokio has to be shortened to no more than 15 minutes...|$|E

The basic theory for the <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> was derived using {{the law of}} the energy conservation. In this basic theory, the <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> was compared with difference collision speed and arm angles of enforcement device.

40|$|Purpose. As {{part of the}} {{scientific}} paper {{it is necessary to}} study the waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on longitudinal train dynamics at different modes of braking. At this one should estimate the level of maximum longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> size in freight cars of various lengths. Methodology. In this paper we attempt to approximate the actual diagram of braking cylinders filling with rational functions of varying degrees. In selection of coefficients in the required functions the highest values of the longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> were used as controlled parameters. They were compared with similar values obtained as a result of experimental rides. The level of longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> amount were evaluated by means of mathematical modeling of train longitudinal vibrations, caused by different braking modes. Findings. At mathematical modeling was assumed that the train consists of 60 uniform four-axle gondola cars, weight of 80 tons, equipped with air dispenser No. 483 included in the median operation, composite braking blocks, and one locomotive VL- 8. Train before braking has been pre-stretched. Various types of pneumatic braking (emergency, full service and adjusting braking) of the freight train on the horizontal section of the track were simulated. As the calculation results were obtained values of the longitudinal forces, <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> amounts and reduction time in speed at various braking modes. Originality. Waveform impact of the braking cylinders filling on the longitudinal forces level and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> amount in freight trains were investigated. Also the longitudinal loading of freight trains at various pneumatic braking was investigated. Practical value. Obtained results can be used to assess the level of largest longitudinal forces and <b>braking</b> <b>distances</b> in the freight trains of different lengths by mathematical modeling of different braking modes...|$|R

The Slipping Tramcar Prevention Equipment is mainly composed of an intercepting door and a buffering system, in which an energy absorber is the key component. The braking dynamic model of the energy absorber is studied by establishing a Lagrange equation and simulating the braking progress by the software of Simulink. The <b>braking</b> simulation <b>distances</b> curves of the energy absorber are obtained under the different initial conditions of tramcar mass and velocity, which shows that the tramcar velocity and mass both have a significant influence on the <b>braking</b> <b>distance.</b> The analysis on variance and range is developed for further comparison on the two key factors implying that tramcar mass is of the most great importance.

40|$|This thesis work {{conducts a}} study on {{modelling}} car drivers’ start of brake when forward vehicle is stationary or when it is moving with constant velocity. The euroFOT data collected by Volvo Car Corporation in the Gothenburg area of Sweden has been the main data source for modelling purposes. The data segments used consist of braking events where the host vehicle is approaching the forward vehicle. The selection of data segments was further limited by addition of the constraint the forward vehicle has constant velocity or is stationary. A thorough literature investigation recommended several approaches to predict driver’s brake initiation in terms of distance {{as well as other}} perceptual or physical factors that are decisive on driver’s braking behaviour. With the help of previous knowhow, distance to target vehicle at drivers’ brake initiation and inverse time to collision (TTC) approaches have been selected for modelling. Vehicle dynamics related factors such as velocity, acceleration, yaw rate etc. and other factors presented in literature such as reaction time, visual angle, TTC, preferred time headway, preferred distance to vehicle ahead have been subjected to a correlation analysis to identify the significant parameters related to drivers’ <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> and inverse TTC preference. Single and multiple linear regression analysis have been applied to the combination of selected parameters to establish an equation, which gives the minimum prediction error. Both normal and lognormal values of measured <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> were used in regression analysis. The results suggested that, for brake events where target vehicle is stationary, the <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> is best predicted with normal <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> based modelling. On the contrary, modelling based on lognormal <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> offered better estimation results for constant target vehicle velocity events. The best population fit and smallest prediction error is resulted with lognormal <b>braking</b> <b>distance</b> based modelling for constant target vehicle velocity condition. Interestingly, the inverse TTC approach provided promising results for the constant target vehicle velocity condition whereas the case for stationary target vehicle, inverse TTC did not lead to strong results. Finally, the study is concluded with various recommendations for possible future investigations...|$|R
