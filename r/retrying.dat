According to Walters, the matter was unrelated to the assault on Barker, and {{it had not been}} referred to during the Barker proceedings. The defense filed a motion to dismiss the Barker charges on the ground that <b>retrying</b> Bell would amount to double jeopardy. On November 8, 2007, Mauffray denied the motion.|$|E
5|$|Gasketball is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching sports {{video game}} where players flick {{basketballs}} through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, circular saw blades, and gravity switches) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball shot off multiple surfaces {{before making the}} basket. In the HORSE-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor before entering the hoop. In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without <b>retrying,</b> and have five attempts to make the hoop {{before moving to the}} next level shamefully. Players are awarded medals for the quality of their performance {{at the end of each}} chapter. Gold medals unlock new modes of play in the chapter. Every chapter has a unique theme, such as a construction site or outer space.|$|E

An optimal <b>retry</b> policy for a given fault characteristic, which determines the maximum allowable <b>retry</b> durations to minimize the total task completion time was derived. The combined fault characterization and <b>retry</b> decision, in which the characteristics of fault are estimated simultaneously with {{the determination of the}} optimal <b>retry</b> policy were carried out. Two solution approaches were developed, one based on the point estimation and the other on the Bayes sequential decision. The maximum likelihood estimators are used for the first approach, and the backward induction for testing hypotheses in the second approach. Numerical examples in which all the durations associated with faults have monotone hazard functions, e. g., exponential, Weibull and gamma distributions are presented. These are standard distributions commonly used for modeling analysis and faults...|$|R
25|$|Saints Row 2 is an action-adventure {{video game}} set {{in an open}} world environment, {{offering}} the player a large open environment in which to move around. The player's character is capable of maneuvering through the environment, utilizing weaponry and engaging in melee combat warfare. After successfully completing the first game mission, the player is able to explore the environment and choose how they wish to play the game. Missions are unlocked by earning 'respect' points from minigames and side-missions and although completing missions is necessary for game progression, players can complete them at their own leisure. The player is granted the option of instantly <b>retrying</b> the missions should they fail an attempt. Numerous checkpoints save progress in each mission, and missions can be replayed from locations within the environment. Aside from attempting missions, the player can explore the environment, purchase items at shops {{and participate in the}} aforementioned mini-games and side-missions. The player can also wreak havoc upon the environment which can provoke potentially fatal attention from authoritative forces. The player can recruit members from a friendly gang and use a mobile phone to contact friends and/or businesses, as well as to input cheat codes. Entering cheats will disable Xbox 360 achievements.|$|E

500|$|The Supreme Court of the United States has {{identified}} {{a narrow range}} of errors that require automatic reversal; for all other errors, the decision of a lower court will be upheld if the error was harmless. In 1967, the Supreme Court ruled in Chapman v. California that a constitutional error will only be considered harmless when the court is [...] "able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt". Additionally, when reviewing federal habeas corpus petitions, a petitioner must demonstrate that an error [...] "had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury's verdict". The Supreme Court has also ruled that when reviewing a determination of harmlessness under Chapman, the AEDPA mandates that the reviewing court may not grant a petition for habeas corpus [...] "unless the harmlessness determination itself was unreasonable". According to the Supreme Court, the rationale underlying this doctrine is the public policy concern that states courts should {{not be forced to}} undertake the [...] "arduous task" [...] of <b>retrying</b> criminal defendants [...] "based on mere speculation that the defendant was prejudiced by trial error".|$|E

30|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of the V 2 I fair access with a finite <b>retry</b> limit through constructing an analytical model. Firstly, a 2 -D Markov chain is developed to model the process of the DCF mechanism with a finite <b>retry</b> limit; the transmission probability with access parameters including the minimum window and the <b>retry</b> limit is derived based on the Markov chain. Then, considering the V 2 I unfair access problem, the relationship between the velocity and the transmission probability of a vehicle is derived. Based on the proposed model, given a finite <b>retry</b> limit, the minimum window of a vehicle can be determined according to its velocity. In the simulation, the proposed model is justified to be effective and the V 2 I fair access performance with a finite <b>retry</b> limit is evaluated through comparison.|$|R

[...] All access rules and turnaround cycles for the AD bus apply to the PAR line, just one cycle later. [...] The device listening on the AD bus checks the received parity and asserts the PERR# (parity error) line one cycle after that.
