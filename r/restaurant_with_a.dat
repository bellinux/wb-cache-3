Brewster among them. [...] McCay bets the group that in one month he can make 4000 drawings move. [...] The group laughs and gestures that he is drunk or crazy. [...] McCay sets {{to work in a}} studio where he directs workers to move around bundles of paper and barrels of ink. [...] A month later, McCay gathers his colleagues in front of a film projector.

After quickly moving between various images of New York City, Nas is shown sitting at a table at an open-air <b>restaurant</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> female, at which point he raps the opening lyrics of the song.

500|$|... "Dead Celebrities" [...] makes {{frequent}} {{mention of}} the Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurant chain, describing the food as extremely tasty, but claiming it resulted in bloody stool. Shortly after the episode first aired, a Chipotle spokesperson said via a Twitter message that the claim was false. In the episode's commentary, Trey Parker and Matt Stone admitted that they loved Chipotle, but found it funnier to use a <b>restaurant</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> healthy reputation rather than a place like McDonald's or Taco Bell. Ike's ability to see the spirits of dead celebrities serves as a parody of the 1999 thriller film The Sixth Sense, which stars Haley Joel Osment {{as a young boy}} who can see ghosts. Ike's line, [...] "I see dead celebrities", is a reference to that film's most famous line, [...] "I see dead people." [...] The old lady psychic with a very high-pitched voice is a reference to the character played by Zelda Rubinstein in the 1982 horror film, Poltergeist. Another film reference is made to The Exorcist when the medium is flung from the window. [...] "Dead Celebrities" [...] also mocks the Syfy reality television series Ghost Hunters by featuring the show's stars attempting to contact the celebrity spirits, only to be frightened and run away. Finally, the episode also parodies children's beauty pageants and the tendency of stage mothers to become unhealthily obsessed with their children winning such contests.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the classical restaurants, Paris has several other kinds of traditional eating places. The café arrived in Paris in the 17th century, when the beverage was first brought from Turkey, and by the 18th century Parisian cafés were centres of the city's political and cultural life. The Café Procope on the Left Bank dates from this period. In the 20th century, the cafés of the Left Bank, especially Café de la Rotonde and Le Dôme Café in Montparnasse and Café de Flore and Les Deux Magots on Boulevard Saint Germain, all still in business, were important meeting places for painters, writers and philosophers. A bistro {{is a type of}} eating place loosely defined as a neighbourhood <b>restaurant</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> modest decor and prices and a regular clientele and a congenial atmosphere. Its name is said to have come in 1814 from the Russian soldiers who occupied the city; [...] "bistro" [...] means [...] "quickly" [...] in Russian, and they wanted their meals served rapidly so they could get back their encampment. Real bistros are increasingly rare in Paris, due to rising costs, competition from cheaper ethnic restaurants, and different eating habits of Parisian diners. A brasserie originally was a tavern located next to a brewery, which served beer and food at any hour. Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1867; it became a popular kind of restaurant which featured beer and other beverages served by young women in the national costume associated with the beverage, particular German costumes for beer. Now brasseries, like cafés, serve food and drinks throughout the day.|$|E
