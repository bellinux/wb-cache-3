40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the energy efficiency of China's 30 administrative regions {{during the period}} from 1997 to 2010. Most existing studies ignored the variation of production technologies among <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> China. Taking this factor into account, we introduce a parametric metafrontier approach based on the Shephard energy distance function. For further analysis, <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> China are divided into three groups using cluster analysis. We find that the <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> group 1 (mainly the <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> the east area of China) not only have the highest energy efficiency score, but also take the lead in terms of technology gap ratio. Meanwhile, due to their backward technology levels, the average energy efficiency score of the <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> group 3 (mainly the <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> the west area of China) is particularly low. Moreover, the pooled estimation, which ignores the technology gap among the groups, tends to underestimate the energy efficiency. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We study {{photometric}} properties, chemical abundances {{and sizes}} {{of star formation}} <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> the two principal arms of the galaxy NGC 628 (M 74). The GALEX ultraviolet, optical UBVRI, and H-alpha? surface photometry data are used, including those obtained with the 1. 5 -m telescope of the Maidanak Observatory. The thirty brightest star formation <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> ultraviolet light located in the spiral arms of NGC 628 are identified and studied. We find that the star formation <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> one (longer) arm are systematically brighter and larger than the <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> the other (shorter) arm. However, both luminosity and size distribution functions have approximately the same slopes for the samples of star formation <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> both arms. The star formation <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> the longer arm have a higher star formation rate density than the <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> the shorter arm. The <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> the shorter arm show higher N/O ratio at a higher oxygen abundance, but they have lower ultraviolet and H-alpha? luminosities. These findings can be explained {{if we assume that}} star formation <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> the shorter arm had higher star formation rate in the past, but now it is lower than for those in the opposite arm. Results of stellar evolutionary synthesis show that the brightest <b>regions</b> <b>in</b> the longer arm are slightly younger than the ones in the shorter arm (3. 5 +- 2. 2 Myr versus 6. 0 +- 1. 1 Myr). Our results demonstrate that there is a difference in the inner structures and parameters of the interstellar medium between the spiral arms of NGC 628, one of which is long and hosts a regular chain of bright star formation complexes and the other, shorter one does not.
