Controllers operated two airports simultaneously in three experimental conditions. <b>Radio</b> <b>communication</b> data was analysed in order to detect qualitative changes in the <b>radio</b> <b>communication,</b> like slips and compensation strategies. Significant statistical effects could only {{be found in the}} transmission of wind information. However, strong interindividual differences became apparent. The content of <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> remained stable, even if one controller operated two airports. Individual strategies, developed at the controllers’ base airport, seem to have a stronger influence compared to the experimental conditions...|$|R

For example, Congress suspended section 315, equal time provision, for a TV forum on presidential election in 1960 because every candidate has to have same portion of time to speak.|$|R
