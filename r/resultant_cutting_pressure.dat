Micromilling aims to produce micro parts with new applications, high performance and quality, requiring production conditions favorable for surface {{integrity of the}} workpiece and the useful life of the tool. Super duplex UNS S 32750 stainless steel is used in chemical process pressure vessels, piping and heat exchangers, offshore oil production/technology, {{oil and gas industry}} equipment and it is known to have two phases with relevant differences concerning mechanical properties.

In order {{to estimate the}} cutting forces in complex 5 -axis machining an enhanced solid modeler kernel based model is developed to find the complicated engagement between cutter and workpiece for each cutter location. In this paper, cutter-workpiece engagement model is presented using the commercial Parasolid solid modeler kernel, and then cutting forces are estimated based on the developed model. In this approach, the <b>resultant</b> <b>cutting</b> forces are kept constant on a user defined threshold.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a model to}} predict cutting force and motion of the rotating insert in cutting processes with self-propelled rotary tools (SPRT). Metal cutting utilizing rotary tools is effective to suppress tool wear and thus it {{is considered to be}} suitable to attain high performance machining of difficult-to-cut materials. It is well known that a circular insert attached to a rotational axis is self-propelled due to inclined chip flow on rake face plane by setting certain oblique angle. A resultant insert rotation speed can be easily predicted considering a frictionless rotary axis. However, friction at the rotary axis of SPRTs may not be negligible in practice especially when slide bearings are employed. In order to investigate the influence of the friction at the rotation axis on the rotary cutting process, a new cutting model is proposed. As the friction at the rotation axis causes a decrease in a speed of round insert rotation, an equivalent oblique cutting process is taken into account in the proposed model utilizing conventional theoretical model. In the equivalent process, the tangential component of the <b>resultant</b> <b>cutting</b> force corresponds to the friction force at the rotary axis. The friction force is determined by cutting force component normal to force-bearing mechanism and the bearing's friction coefficient. Considering the equilibrium condition in cutting and friction forces, the <b>resultant</b> <b>cutting</b> force and the insert rotation speed are iteratively computed in the proposed model. Edge force model is also associated with the oblique cutting model, which is not negligible especially in machining difficult-to-cut materials. The developed model is extended to simulate milling processes with SPRTs. The proposed model is experimentally verified, and influence of the bearing friction of SPRT on the process is clarified...|$|R

40|$|Metal cutting is {{a process}} that uses tools to create new {{surfaces}} by imparting intense shear stresses and high strain rates on the work material. Consequently, the mechanical properties of the work material directly influence its machinability, and high strength materials such as titanium are notoriously difficult to cut. Laser assisted machining (LAM) is a promising solution to reduce the <b>cutting</b> <b>pressures</b> when machining difficult-to-cut materials. The method involves using a laser beam to locally heat and reduce the flow stress of the material ahead of an advancing cutting tool, making the metal shearing process easier.
