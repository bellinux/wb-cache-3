500|$|The car {{has three}} {{monitors}} on the dashboard, the first monitors {{the status of}} important components, while the second controls the sound system, and the last is a <b>rev</b> <b>counter,</b> digital speedometer and the fuel gauge. CNET described the speed gauge monitor as clear and [...] "close to the driver's natural line of sight", but criticized the other two monitors for being unreadable and possibly dangerous if used by the driver while the car is moving. Some reviewers complained about the vehicle's soundproofing, which could not adequately conceal the screech of the wind. The engine at high speed received mixed reviews, while a number of reviewers reported a fault with the screenwash bottle, which can freeze in cold weather and blow a fuse when used. The reviewer for European Car of the Year 2010 called the nominated C3 Picasso fuel efficient, but said it had [...] "dull steering".|$|E
2500|$|An even sportier version {{appeared}} in November 1983, when the CT and CT-G Turbo versions were offered. The F5A Turbo was Suzuki's first forced induction car engine and produced [...] and a useful [...] It received an electronic carburetor {{and a lower}} compression rate of 8,6:1. Only a five-speed manual transmission was available, and front disc brakes were standard. The CT weighed in at , prices were ¥748,000 and ¥898,000 respectively. A two-tone red-and-black interior and dummy hood scoop added to the Turbo's sporty looks, while the CT-G also received a <b>rev</b> <b>counter.</b> Top speed has been quoted at [...]|$|E
2500|$|Almost a year later, {{the ban on}} {{long range}} flights lifted by a new administration, an attempt on the {{straight}} line record was made at last. By this time the record was held by Rossi and Codos in the Blériot 110 at 9,104km (5,658mi). L'Oiseau Canari II left Oran on 4 October 1933, crewed by Jean Assolant and René Lefèvre, hoping to reach Saigon. [...] After 24 hours they realized that the engine was consuming 10 L of fuel per hour more than expected, an excess of about 0.6% [...] [...] This put the record just out of reach: the FAI stipulation that the old record had to be beaten by 100km (62mi) left them an estimated 200km (124mi) short. They therefore landed in Karachi, having flown 6,600km (4,100mi) in 27 hours. An inaccurate <b>rev</b> <b>counter</b> may have been partly {{to blame for the}} over-consumption.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Paul, Max and Alfred Mühle, the sons of Robert Mühle, the company could expand its product range. So from about 1925 on speedometers, <b>rev</b> <b>counters</b> and car clocks were made. These not only are used in cars of the brands Maybach and DKW, also BMW motorcycles were equipped with Mühle-tachometers.|$|R
50|$|It had {{a crew of}} five (six in {{the bomber}} version), with cockpit {{accommodation}} for two pilots sitting side-by-side. Instrumentation in the central panel included oil and fuel gauges, altimeters for low and high altitude (1,000 and 8,000 m), clock, airspeed and vertical speed indicator, gyroscope, compass, artificial horizon, turn and bank indicator, <b>rev</b> <b>counters</b> and throttles.|$|R
50|$|Although F1 Digital+ was a {{commercial}} failure, {{many of the}} innovations the service offered were gradually implemented on the main Formula One World Feed over the following seasons. In 2004 new television overlays were introduced which closely reflected those of F1 Digital+, reintroducing elements such as the lap counter, track status indicators and <b>rev</b> <b>counters.</b> Team Radio was broadcast at the 2004 Chinese Grand Prix and was available at every race from the 2006 season onwards.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the time}} of launch of the Mark IIF Polo, the highest {{performance}} model was the Polo GT. This featured a multi-point fuel-injected version of the 1,272 cc engine, and {{a top speed of}} more than 100mph. This produced [...] and had a quoted top speed of [...] 0–60 figures stood at 11.1 seconds. Defining features of the GT include red piping in the bumpers, black overhead cloth, a <b>rev</b> <b>counter</b> and a red [...] "GT" [...] badge in the grille. This was succeeded by the launch of the G40 in May 1991, displacing the GT as the most powerful Polo at the time, with a top speed of around 120mph – rivalling the likes of the Ford Fiesta XR2i, Peugeot 205 GTI and Renault Clio 16v. The GT squareback was discontinued in 1992 due to poor sales in comparison with the coupé version.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1968 {{came the}} Suzuki Fronte SS 360 with , with the sportier yet Suzuki Fronte SSS {{to follow in}} April 1970. The SS was the quickest kei-car yet, {{managing}} to break the twenty second barrier in reaching 400metres from standing with 19.95seconds. The car had different wheels and also featured a <b>rev</b> <b>counter.</b> It was introduced with an unusual marketing stunt: racing driver Stirling Moss and TT-winning motorcycle racer Mitsuo Itoh were engaged to drive two SS Frontes (one red, one pale yellow) on a high-speed demonstration journey along Italy's [...] Autostrada del Sole leading from Milan to Napoli. In the end, the average speed attained was , respectable for a car with an engine smaller than those of most motorcycles. The original car currently resides in Suzuki's museum in Hamamatsu. In 1969 the [...] "SS Standard" [...] model also appeared, with the powerful engine but {{with a minimum of}} trim, sepcifically intended for competition purposes.|$|E

5000|$|The local Stamford paper {{chronicled the}} feud with [...] "our dashing Rev. Long". <b>Rev.</b> Long would <b>counter</b> that you cannot [...] "understand nature {{when you have}} a gun on your hip, ride on top of a wagon or horseback, and have a crowd of twenty with you," [...] taking aim at Teddy Roosevelt's much publicized and photographed forays into nature. He went so far to state Roosevelt [...] "never met an animal he didn't kill." [...] After a couple months {{back and forth in the}} Stamford and {{national}} papers, Rev. Long said that [...] "while obviously we cannot settle this through the media, I invite President Roosevelt anytime to Stamford to settle this like men." ...|$|R

5000|$|There is one {{unsupported}} {{claim that}} [...] "Having a higher-revving engine, the Sprint received a recalibrated rev counter". However, this is incorrect: both engines had a rev limit of 6500 rpm indicated on the <b>rev</b> <b>counter,</b> though both owners' manuals give the [...] "Maximum recommended engine speed (intermittent)" [...] as 6,000 rpm. Hence, the TR7 and TR7 Sprint {{shared a common}} <b>rev</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|E
50|$|July 1968 - South Africa: MG 1100S with 58 b.h.p, twin SU HS2, 1098cc engine replaces MG 1100. <b>Rev</b> <b>counter</b> and {{oil cooler}} fitted as standard.|$|E
50|$|Air {{conditioning}} was {{standard on}} the LX and an option on the LS. The LX also offered an enhanced instrument cluster with a <b>rev</b> <b>counter</b> {{and a larger}} display that also displayed the outside temperature.|$|E
50|$|Available {{with the}} 1093 cc engine the Coupé {{featured}} additions such as sporting seats trim, wheel arch extensions, rear spoiler, low profile tyres and a <b>rev</b> <b>counter,</b> {{as well as}} the round headlights which were later fitted across the range. The GL featured a 60 PS (44 kW) engine. In 1985, the first sporty Polo, the Coupé GT, was introduced with a 75 PS (55 kW) engine, as well as servo assisted brakes, twin headlights, a digital clock, sports seats and a <b>rev</b> <b>counter.</b> Other special feature models were introduced over the rest of the period of the Mark 2 production run including models such as the Twist, Parade and Country.|$|E
50|$|September 1965: Introduction of the Wolseley 1100 and Riley Kestrel, both {{of which}} were {{mechanically}} similar to the MG 1100. The Wolseley had a strip speedometer, while the Riley Kestrel had round dials and a <b>rev</b> <b>counter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Inside {{there was}} a bench seat back and {{individual}} squabs covered in PVC, with leather as an option, and rubber floor covering. A heater was available as an option as was a <b>rev</b> <b>counter</b> and more surprisingly, direction indicators.|$|E
5000|$|The Rhythm, three door or five door, this trim added remote central locking, {{colour coded}} wing mirrors, two side airbags and an engine <b>rev</b> <b>counter.</b> The 1.4 HDi diesel and the 1.0i petrol engines were both {{available}} with this trim.|$|E
50|$|Intended {{for serious}} off road and {{competition}} use, the Fury was supplied with optional lights, mounting an optional <b>rev</b> <b>counter,</b> an 18 in rear wheel and a 19 in front wheel. Only 191 Furies were made between 1959 and 1963, when production ended.|$|E

It has a MSRP of £200,411 including a four-year warranty.|$|E
50|$|Instruments {{varied from}} car to car in {{accordance}} with pilot specifications but also according to engine type used. In the IoM tourist Trophy the following were used: Jaeger <b>rev</b> <b>counter,</b> Sunbeam oil pressure gauge, fuel air pressure, twin magneto switches, twin glass oil restrictors.|$|E
5000|$|GPxSat gives {{official}} {{timing information}} displayed {{as if it}} was on TV, overlays include the classic Tag Heuer graphics, and the more up-to-date modern Siemens graphics. The section GPxCInfo also gives the opportunity to add custom 'panels' such as a <b>rev</b> <b>counter</b> and the F1 logo as displayed on television.|$|E
50|$|The XT 125R has an {{electronic}} display with different selectable modes: numbered Rpm, lap timer, millage, average speed, clock and trip distance. The standard Display is a bar displayed <b>rev</b> <b>counter</b> {{along with a}} speed reading. Lights {{on the side of}} the display indicate high beam and low beam, low fuel, indicators and neutral.|$|E
50|$|A 'warm' {{version of}} the 100 called the 114 GTa was {{available}} from launch. The main differences over the 114 SLi three-door - which has the same engine - were sports seats, red seatbelts, a <b>rev</b> <b>counter,</b> sports suspension, a slightly higher top speed, faster acceleration, GSi alloy wheels and GTa badging. It was only available as a three-door.|$|E
50|$|The CB400N Super Dream {{was very}} similar to the 250N variant. However, it {{differed}} from the 250N with its larger engine capacity, twin front brake discs and a halogen front head light. The front instrument had different markings for the <b>rev</b> <b>counter</b> and speed to reflect the lower maximum engine speed and higher top speed of the 400N.|$|E
5000|$|April 1974: Introduction of the R5 LS, {{same as the}} R5 TL {{but with}} a larger 1.3 engine, {{different}} design steel wheels, H4 iodine headlights, electric windscreen washers, fully carpeted floor ahead of the front seats, carpeted rear parcel shelf, electronic <b>rev</b> <b>counter,</b> daily totalizer, two-speed ventilation system, rear wiper, and illuminated ashtray with cigarette lighter.|$|E
50|$|A vane {{anemometer}} thus combines a propeller and a tail {{on the same}} axis to obtain accurate and precise wind speed and direction measurements from the same instrument. The speed of the fan is measured by a <b>rev</b> <b>counter</b> and converted to a windspeed by an electronic chip. Hence, volumetric flowrate may be calculated if the cross-sectional area is known.|$|E
50|$|The Venom used Miller {{electrics}} up to 1962, with a belt-driven dynamo. After 1962 {{this was}} changed to a Lucas system. The speedometer, ammeter and light switch on the original Venoms were fitted into a steel headlamp nacelle; the optional <b>rev</b> <b>counter</b> {{had to go on}} a bracket. Later models with Thruxton forks had conventional headlamp brackets and separate instruments.|$|E
5000|$|From {{the outside}} {{the car was}} {{distinguished}} from its siblings by a Riley grille {{on the front and}} (apart from the MG with which it shared its tail treatment) slightly less acute tail fins at the back. [...] Inside, the fascia was relatively well equipped: this {{was the only one of}} the five cars to come with a <b>rev</b> <b>counter</b> as standard equipment.|$|E
5000|$|... 1993 (August) Polonez {{after the}} next facelift: front and rear track 60 mm wider, fresh air inlet moved from hood {{to the front of}} the windscreen, better front and rear wipe-wash kinematics, longer arms and larger wiped area, changes in the dashboard: {{circular}} speedometer and <b>rev</b> <b>counter,</b> four instead of two fresh air outlets, illuminated switches and remote headlamps shaft regulator.|$|E
50|$|Honda capitalised {{on their}} {{long hours of}} testing at Zandvoort when Ginther claimed a front-row space with Graham Hill and Clark. He shot into the lead for the first 2 laps. Hill took the lead and then Clark overtook him on lap 6. Hill fell back with <b>rev</b> <b>counter</b> {{problems}} and Stewart was left to duel with first Gurney and then Clark-ending up with a Scottish 1-2.|$|E
50|$|The {{completed}} chassis {{and engine}} were then {{shipped to the}} Maserati restoration experts at Steve Hart Racing in England. In completing the restoration, the restoration facility added additional original Birdcage parts including rear lights, repeater lights, <b>rev</b> <b>counter,</b> ignition switch (also known as the light switch), starter button, indicator switch (also known as turn signal), and front hubs. This information is verified in a letter written and signed by the restoration facility owner.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "YT" [...] Tourer did {{not benefit}} from ‘displayed’ {{woodwork}} but had the same standard of seat trim. It did have more instrumentation, in {{that there was a}} tachometer (or <b>rev</b> <b>counter)</b> in front of the driver, the speedometer was positioned in front of the passenger with a central bank of subsidiary dials in the centre, giving a similar sporting appearance to the TC with a [...] "double scuttle" [...] dash.|$|E
50|$|The M4 also {{includes}} an electronically controlled limited-slip differential, electric steering, additional bolted joints between the axle subframe {{and the body}} sills, aluminium stiffening plate and a five-link rear suspension constructed from aluminium Carbon-fibre {{is used for the}} roof, bootlid, strut brace and driveshaft.
