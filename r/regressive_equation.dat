Essentially, the approach {{is based on a}} so-called pqR-decomposition of the numerator and denominator polynomials of the system’s transfer function.

As an illustrative example, a biomedical/biochemical process with two compartments in parallel and with first-order reaction is used. First, the process is approximated by a discrete-time state-space model. Next, after deriving the corresponding discrete-time transfer function, the rational transfer function is decomposed into pqR form and then reparametrized to obtain a set of linear <b>regressive</b> <b>equations.</b> Subsequently, the unknown linear regression parameters, which are a polynomial function of the original physical parameters, are uniquely estimated from real data of the biomedical/biochemical process using the ordinary least-squares method.

Methods　By random cluster sampling, a total of 390 military drivers (experimental group) and 396 military non-drivers (control group) were chosen as subjects, and they were investigated with the Military Personnel Resilience Scale (MPRS) and Trait Coping Styles Questionnaire (TCSQ). The relationship between the psychological bearing capacity and trait coping style, and the influencing factors were analyzed. Descriptive statistics, independent sample t-test, correlation analysis and multiple stepwise regression analysis were performed by SPSS 17. 0 software. Results　 Compared to the control group, the scores of problem-solving, will power, self-confidence and the total score of MPRS were higher in experimental group (P< 0. 01 or 0. 05). Correlation analysis suggested all the factors of MPRS in the drivers were positively correlated with positive coping style (P< 0. 01 or 0. 05) and negatively correlated with negative coping style (P< 0. 01); the will power was positively correlated with educational level (P< 0. 05).

When the wavelength interval (Δλ) at 2 nm was selected to calculate the first derivative ratio spectra values, the first derivative amplitudes at 461 nm and 466 nm were suitable for quantitatively determining β-carotene and astaxanthin, respectively. Effect of divisor on derivative ratio spectra could be neglected; any concentration used as divisor in range of 1. 0 to 4. 0 µg/ml is ideal for calculating the derivative ratio spectra values of the two carotenoids.

Methods: Patients admitted to a neurologic intensive care unit (ICU) due to cerebral infarction were included. Neurologic and non-neurologic predictors for in-unit mortality were determined by logistic regression analyses. Two models using (A) neurologic factors and (B) combined neurologic and non-neurologic factors as mortality predictors were developed. The performance of the models in predicting overall, neurologic and non-neurologic mortalities was compared by areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) of the derived <b>regressive</b> <b>equations.</b> Results: Of 231 patients with cerebral infarction admitted to the ICU, 34 (14. 7 %) died during ICU stay.

The aim of our study {{was to develop a}} mathematical model for predicting correct umbilical positioning in a sample of young women and men and in a sample of middle-aged women. In addition, we wanted to develop a predictive model applicable to both sexes. We applied our models with distinct anthropometric characteristics such as body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC) /hip circumference (HC) to further expand our findings. [...] - Methods: In this study, 98 Croatian women and men randomly selected from the University of Zagreb and 46 female patients awaiting abdominoplasty procedure at our institution were included. Anthropometric data and measurements between the umbilicus and fixed bony points around the anterior abdomen were collected. The data collected were body weight (BW), body height (BH), BMI, WC and HC, and waist-hip ratios. All collected data were subjected to standard statistical analyses. [...] - Results: This study developed 2 different <b>regressive</b> <b>equations</b> for the most accurate prediction of exact umbilical localization. In women, the best prediction of the position of the umbilicus was based on the distance from the interanterior hypochondrium line to the umbilicus using the following regressive equation: u-i-hy = BM x 0. 5799 + BH x - 0. 5051 + BMI x 1. 8230 + WHR x - 10. 6364 + 89. 6411. In men, the best prediction of the position of the umbilicus was based on the distance from the umbilicus to the interspinous line using the following regressive equation: u-i-is = age x 0. 2033 + BW x 0. 6445 + BH x - 0. 5692 + BMI x - 2. 2802 + WC x - 0. 0911 + 101. 9408.

The naturally occurring anthropometric variations between women and men made the results of a unique predictive model for umbilical position inaccurate. We found that using 2 distinct predictive models, 1 for both subgroups of women and 1 for men, generated the most accurate predictive results.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} at {{high temperature}} Abstract. Material strength {{is one of}} the most important factors in designing a building. For this reason, many structural steel manufacturers have been trying to develop it. In Korea, SM 570 is one high structural steel that has many merits such as longer span and reduction of construction cost for steel works. However, the fire resistance performance of H-section made of SM 570 has not been evaluated. Especially, in high-rise steel building that can be built with various joint systems like hinged to hinge, hinge to fixed, and fixed to fixed. However, the performance of fire resistant is limited. In this paper, to evaluate the fire resistance of H-section made of SM 570, the advanced fire design was conducted using <b>regressive</b> <b>equation</b> of the mechanical and thermal properties at high temperature, compared with those made of an ordinary structural steel, SS 400. The facts show that hinge to hinge had the lowest load bearing capacity at high temperature. Therefore, to keep the same fire resistance with other types boundary conditions, the more passive fire materials are required...|$|E

40|$|The {{flexibility}} coefficient is popularly used {{to implement the}} macroevaluation of shape, safety, and economy for arch dam. However, the description of {{flexibility coefficient}} has not drawn a widely consensus all the time. Based on {{a large number of}} relative instance data, the relationship between influencing factor and flexibility coefficient is analyzed by means of partial least-squares regression. The partial least-squares regression equation of flexibility coefficient in certain height range between 30 [*]m and 70 [*]m is established. <b>Regressive</b> precision and <b>equation</b> stability are further investigated. The analytical model of statistical flexibility coefficient is provided. The flexibility coefficient criterion is determined preliminarily to evaluate the shape of low- and medium-sized arch dam. A case study is finally presented to illustrate the potential engineering application. According to the analysis result of partial least-squares regression, it is shown that there is strong relationship between flexibility coefficient and average thickness of dam, thickness-height ratio of crown cantilever, arc height ratio, and dam height, but the effect of rise-span ratio is little relatively. The considered factors in the proposed model are more comprehensive, and the applied scope is clearer than that of the traditional calculation methods. It is more suitable for the analogy analysis in engineering design and the safety evaluation for arch dam...|$|R

Um total de 102 peixes adultos, da linhagem GIFT, machos invertidos, pesando entre 260 e 580 g, foram avaliados quanto ao peso total (PT), circunferÃncia {{corporal}} mÃdia (CR) e mensurados por ultrassonografia em quatro regiÃes corpÃreas prÃ-definidas: (1) entre a base de inserÃÃo anterior da nadadeira pÃlvica atÃ o tÃrmino anterior da nadadeira dorsal, (2) entre a base da inserÃÃo anterior da nadadeira anal atÃ o Ãltimo raio duro da nadadeira dorsal, (3) entre a inserÃÃo final das nadadeiras anal e dorsal e (4) entre a inserÃÃo ventral e dorsal da nadadeira caudal. As equaÃÃes de prediÃÃo a partir das mensuraÃÃes realizadas em 50 exemplares foram analisadas pelos procedimentos estatÃsticos backward e stepwise. As mensuraÃÃes feitas nos 52 exemplares restantes foram utilizadas para a validaÃÃo das equaÃÃes preditoras para PF e RF. A validaÃÃo foi feita a partir do ajuste de modelos lineares de 1 Â grau dos valores observados sobre os valores preditos por cada equaÃÃo de regressÃo definida. As equaÃÃes PFx e RFx, estimadas em funÃÃo dos dados coletados das imagens ultrassonogrÃficas, apresentaram valores de coeficiente de determinaÃÃo (RÂ) de 0, 53 (PF 1 = - 17, 35 + 3, 66 HD 2 - 45, 20 LE 4 + 0, 55 AE 2 + 4, 64 AE 4) e 0, 15 (RF 1 = 26, 66 + 0, 043 AE 2), no backward, e 0, 53 (PF 2 = - 58, 03 + 5, 65 HE 4 + 0, 33 AD 1 + 0, 65 AD 2) e 0, 19 (RF 2 = 25, 02 + 0, 051 AD 2), no stepwise. A inclusÃo das medidas de CR e PT como regressoras permitiu que as equaÃÃes apresentassem RÂ mais elevados, com valores de 0, 97 (PF 3 = - 52, 25 - 1, 26 HE 1 - 2, 03 HE 3 + 0, 40 PT + 0, 51 CR e PF 4 = - 18, 12 - 1, 20 HE 1 + 0, 425 PT) e 0, 73 (RF 3 = 17, 83 - 0, 29 HE 1 - 0, 49 HE 3 + 0, 02 PT + 0, 13 CR), no backward e no stepwise, e 0, 68 (RF 4 = 26, 14 - 0, 27 HE 1 + 0, 027 PT), no stepwise, e menores valores de quadrado mÃdio do resÃduo, indicando que esses modelos de regressÃo apresentaram elevada aderÃncia aos dados de PF e RF. Na validaÃÃo das equaÃÃes preditoras, todas foram eficientes em estimar o PF e o RF na amostra avaliada. As equaÃÃes PF 3 (P = 1, 0000), PF 4 (P = 0, 5401), RF 3 (P = 1, 0000) e RF 4 (P = 0, 8363) foram as mais precisas e aplicÃveis na prediÃÃo de PF e RF em tilÃpia do Nilo. A altura do lado esquerdo nas regiÃes corporais 1 e 3, mensuradas por imagens ultrassonogrÃficas, em conjunto com o peso e a circunferÃncia corporal mÃdia, sÃo regressoras importantes na prediÃÃo do PF e RF de tilÃpia do Nilo. As equaÃÃes de regressÃo PF 3, PF 4, RF 3 e RF 4 sÃo recomendadas para estimar o PF e o RF de tilÃpia no Nilo adultas, machos fenotÃpicos, linhagem GIFT, com peso entre 260 e 580 gThis study {{aimed to}} predict the fillet weight (PF) and fillet yield (RF) of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) from external measures, measured by morphometry and measures of epiaxial muscles using ultrasound and validate the estimated equations using another sample biometric data. A total of 102 adult fish GIFT lineage, reversed males weighing between 260 and 580 g had the total weight (PT) and body circumference average (CR) all measured by ultrasonography in four predefined body regions (1) between the basis of anterior (2) between the basis of anteriour insertion of anal fin to the last hard ray of dorsal fin. (3) between the final insertion of anal and dorsal fins and (4) between the ventral and dorsal insertion of caudal fin. The prediction equations from the measurements performed on 50 samples were analyzed by statistical procedures backward and stepwise. The measurements made in remaining 52 samples were used for validation of predictive equations to PF and RF. The validation were made from adjustment of linear models first degree of values observed above the values predict on each regression equation set. The equations PFx and RFx estimated from data collected of ultrasound images showed coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 53 (PF 1 = - 17. 35 + 3. 66 HD 2 â 45. 20 LE 4 + 0. 55 AE 2 + 4. 64 AE 4) e 0. 15 (RF 1 = 26. 66 + 0. 043 AE 2), in backward, and 0. 53 (PF 2 = - 58. 03 + 5. 65 HE 4 + 0. 33 AD 1 + 0. 65 AD 2) e 0. 19 (RF 2 = 25. 02 + 0. 051 AD 2), in stepwise. The inclusion of measures of CR and PT as <b>regressive</b> <b>equations</b> did allow the equations to show higher values of R 2 such as 0. 97 (PF 3 = - 52. 25 â 1. 26 HE 1 â 2. 03 HE 3 + 0. 40 PT + 0. 51 CR e PF 4 = - 18. 12 â 1. 20 HE 1 + 0. 425 PT) and 0. 73 (RF 3 = 17. 83 â 0. 29 HE 1 â 0. 49 HE 3 + 0. 02 PT + 0. 13 CR), in backward and stepwise, and 0. 68 (RF 4 = 26, 14 - 0, 27 HE 1 + 0, 027 PT), in stepwise, and lower values of mean square of residue that these regression models presented high adherence to data of PF and RF. About the validation of prediction equations all of it were effective in estimating the PF and RF in the sample evaluated. The equations (P = 1. 0000) PF 3, PF 4 (P = 0. 5401), RF 3 (P = 1. 0000) and RF 4 (P = 0. 8363) were the most accurate and applicable in predicting PF and RF in Nile tilapia. The height of the left side body regions 1 and 3, measured by ultrasound images, together with the average body weight and circumference, are important in predicting of regressive of PF and RF of Nile tilapia.
