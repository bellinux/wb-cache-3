40|$|Riley <b>Day</b> <b>Syndrome,</b> {{also known}} as {{familial}} dysautonomia, is a rare reported entity characterised by disturbance of pain and temperature perceptions, inability to produce tears, labile blood pressure and poor growth due to disorder of the autonomic and sensory nervous system. It is an autosomal recessive condition with the genetic locus mapped to chromosome 9 q 31 – q 33. Traumatic fractures are common and {{due to lack of}} pain, may go unrecognised for prolonged periods of time, resulting in nonunion or pseudoarthrosis. Scoliosis is seen in up to 90 % of the patients. Complications of are common in these patients and range from infection to wound breakdown to failure of fixation.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{describe}} a unique 7 th <b>day</b> <b>syndrome</b> (7 DS), quite different from other causes of post-transplantation allograft dysfunction in a group of orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) patients who needed retransplantation. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 594 consecutive OLT over an 8 -year period revealed that 10 patients developed allograft dysfunction approximately 7 days folio-wing an initially normal graft function. Results: The features included: (a) severe liver failure; (b) sudden peak of extremely high liver enzymes at approximately day 7; (c) serial liver biopsy findings of central lobular hemorrhage with minimal inflammatory cell infiltrate and (d) an explant with no evidence of vascular thrombosis. The biochemical and morphometric pathological data of these patients were compared with data of patients who had early acute rejection (AR), hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT), primary nonfunction (PNF), severe sepsis and no dysfunction. Lastly, serial liver core biopsies and explants were tested for evidence of apoptosis, which revealed a significantly higher number of apoptotic hepatocytes in 7 DS compared to all control groups. Conclusions: Seventh <b>Day</b> <b>Syndrome</b> is a distinct entity associated with early graft dysfunction characterized by a marked apoptosis of hepatocytes. Fas receptor activation or other pathways of program cell death may be implicated in occurrence of 7 DS...|$|R

40|$|Riley <b>Day</b> <b>syndrome,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as familial dysautonomia (FD), is a genetic disease with extremely labile blood pressure due to baroreflex deafferenation. Chronic renal disease is very frequent in these patients and was attributed to recurrent arterial hypotension and renal hypoperfusion. Aggressive treatment of hypotension, however, has not reduced its prevalence. We evaluated the frequency of kidney malformations as well as the impact of hypertension, hypotension and blood pressure variability on the severity of renal impairment. We also investigated the effect of fludrocortisone treatment on the progression of renal disease. Patients with FD appeared to have an increased incidence of hydronephrosis/reflux and patterning defects. Patients younger than 4 years old had hypertension and normal eGFR. Patients with more severe hypertension and greater variability in their blood pressure had worse renal function (both, p< 0. 01). In contrast, there was no relationship between eGFR and the lowest blood pressure recorded during upright tilt. The progression of renal disease was faster in patients receiving fludrocortisone (p< 0. 02). Hypertension precedes kidney disease in these patients. Moreover, increased blood pressur...|$|R

40|$|Summary. Introduction. Acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHL), or Hurst {{disease is}} a rare, usually fatal, disease, {{probably}} due to an autoimmune cross reaction against myelin antigens present in the central nervous system, and which forms a spectrum of postinfeccious demyelinating diseases with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. Case report. The patient was a 21 year old female who presented with an acute encephalopathy and generalized seizures following a 15 <b>day</b> febrile <b>syndrome</b> attributed to amygdalitis; a laboratory work-up, including CSF, was non-diagnostic, and a brain CT scan revealed diffuse cerebral edema. After 12 days the patient died from nosocomial pneumonia and multi-organ failure; neuropathological examination of the brain confirmed the diagnosis of Hurst acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis, with a weak perilesional inflammatory reaction, unlike the usual picture in AHL. Discussion. AHL should {{be a part of}} the differential diagnosis of acute encephalopathic diseases, particularly if preceded by systemic infections. The atypical laboratory findings, and the impossibilty of performing a brain MRI were obstacles to the diagnosis in this case. The relative paucity of the perivascular infiltrate is an atypical finding, and could be due to apoptotic clearance of the inflammatory cells, as has been described in other autoimmune demyelinating diseases...|$|R

They argue that 2 ̆ 2 the hard stuff 2 ̆ 7 is {{at the very heart of}} sf and that its future—still on the path set by the New Wave—is ostensibly a dead end. Many important critics along with hundreds of sf fan websites display this fatalistic concern, asking over and over 2 ̆ 2 Is hard science fiction dead? 2 ̆ 2 The answer is no. These reactionaries suffer from a serious case of the Good Old <b>Days</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (not to mention the Good Old Boys Syndrome). A close look at the state of the genre reveals that hard sf is not only alive and well but also that contemporary hard sf is more in line with its critics 2 ̆ 7 definition of hard sf than the very stories they cite as exemplars of it. Contrary to the accusations of noted sf critics, it may well be that a new golden age of sf is dawning, one with an even truer scientific core as well as a commitment to literary quality. This thesis will expose the curious contradiction between the hard and soft / old and new sf. The introduction will examine the definition of hard sf and declarations of its unfortunate demise. Each of three chapters will compare two stories—one from sf s Golden Age and another after the supposed death of the genre. In each, I will show how classic examples of hard sf regularly fail to meet the objective, scientific criteria they purport to uphold and how contemporary stories—even while focusing (to varying degrees) on the political and personal—better espouse the principles of hard sf. Ultimately, it seems that those who descry hard sf s death miss not the technical aspects of hard sf that, even by their definition, distinguish it from softer sf, but the traditional Golden Age values of male dominance, imperialism, and anti-emotionalism. Newer stories 2 ̆ 7 feminism and redefinitions of progress blind conventional readers to their truly hard-core, science-based foundations. The conclusion will consider what hard sf s paradigm shifts mean in terms of our evolving relationship to science. Specifically, in our technological age, science is not merely a field that studies how things work, but a field that can help us to illuminate and interpret our place in the universe. Ultimately, hard science fiction is not dead, it 2 ̆ 7 s just doing something different from what it used to...|$|R

40|$|Rationale: Relapse to opioids {{is often}} {{driven by the}} {{avoidance}} of the aversive states of opioid withdrawal. We recently demonstrated that activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) by pioglitazone reduces the motivation for heroin and attenuates its rewarding properties. However, the role of PPARγ in withdrawal {{and other forms of}} relapse to heroin is unknown. Objectives: To further address this issue, we investigated the role of PPARγ on the development and expression of morphine withdrawal in mice and the effect of pioglitazone on several forms of heroin relapse in rats. Methods: We induced physical dependence to morphine in mice by injecting morphine twice daily for 6 <b>days.</b> Withdrawal <b>syndrome</b> was precipitated on day 6 with an injection of naloxone. In addition, different groups of rats were trained to self-administer heroin and, after the extinction, the relapse was elicited by cues, priming, or stress. The effect of different doses of pioglitazone was tested on these different paradigms. Results: Data show that chronic and acute administration of pioglitazone attenuates morphine withdrawal symptoms, and these effects are mediated by activation of PPARγ receptors. Activation of PPARγ by pioglitazone also abolishes yohimbine-induced reinstatement of heroin seeking and reduces heroin-induced reinstatement, while it does not affect cue-induced relapse. Conclusions: These findings provide new insights on the role of PPARγ on opioid dependence and suggest that pioglitazone may be useful for the treatment of opioid withdrawal in opioid-addicted individuals...|$|R

We retrospectively studied 107 patients with bone metastases from renal cell carcinoma treated from December 2002 to January 2011 with 163 embolisations using N- 2 -butyl cyanoacrylate (NBCA). Mean tumour diameter before embolisation was 8. 8 cm and mean follow-up 4 years. Clinical and imaging effects of treatment were evaluated at follow-up examinations with a pain score scale, analgesic use, hypoattenuating areas, tumour size and ossification. A clinical response was achieved in 157 (96 %) and no response in six embolisations of sacroiliac metastases. Mean duration of clinical response was 10 (range 1 - 12) months. Hypoattenuating areas resembling tumour necrosis were observed in all patients. Variable ossification appeared in 41 patients. Mean maximal tumour diameter after embolisation was 4. 0 cm.

So, Rafael has been able to construct his identity in a relatively autonomous way, challenging social mandates that led him to exclusion and denied him as a subject.

40|$|Worldwide {{concern over}} Zika virus causing Guillain-Barre {{syndrome}} (GBS) soared after recent reports that Zika-related weakness {{was due to}} GBS. A global strategic response plan was initiated with recommendations for at risk countries to prepare for GBS. This plan has major economic implications, as nations with limited resources struggle to implement costly immunotherapy. Since confirmation of causality is prerequisite to providing specific management recommendations, it is prudent to review data endorsing a GBS diagnosis. We searched PubMed for manuscripts reporting original clinical, laboratory, and electrodiagnostic data on Zika virus and GBS. Five papers met criteria; four case reports and one large case-control study (French Polynesia) that attributed 42 paralysis cases to a motor variant of GBS. Brighton criteria were reportedly used to diagnose GBS, but no differential diagnosis was presented, which violates criteria. GBS was characterized by early onset (median 6 <b>days</b> post-viral <b>syndrome),</b> rapid progression (median 6 days from onset to nadir), and atypical clinical features (52 % lacked areflexia, 48 % of facial palsies were unilateral). Electrodiagnostic evaluations fell short of guidelines endorsed by American Academy of Neurology. Typical anti-ganglioside antibodies in GBS motor variants were rarely present. We conclude {{that there is no}} causal relationship between Zika virus and GBS because data failed to confirm GBS and exclude other causes of paralysis. Focus should be redirected at differential diagnosis, proper use of diagnostic criteria, and electrodiagnosis that follows recommended guidelines. We also call for a moratorium on recommendations for at risk countries to prepare costly immunotherapies directed at GBS...|$|R
40|$|Background & aim: In some studies, {{changes in}} trace {{elements}} of abuse of addictive substances have been mentioned. Due {{to the effects}} of trace elements on the immune system and their effects on susceptibility to infectious agents, {{the purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect(s) of morphine dependency on the concentration of trace elements (copper, zinc and manganese) levels in serum of rats. Methods: In the present study, twenty-four adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups of receiving morphine (experimental) and control one. In the experimental group, morphine were injected subcutaneously twice daily for thirty days. Morphine dose on the first day was 10 mg/ml/kg daily and increased 2 mg/kg daily until it reached a maximum of 68 mg/kg. Instead of morphine, the control group received 1 ml/kg of normal saline for 30 <b>days.</b> Withdrawal <b>syndrome</b> in morphine-dependent groups and the control group were injected with 4 mg/kg naloxone in four animals from each group and then evaluated. Serum concentrations of zinc, copper and manganese were determined by spectrometer coupled plasma optical emission detector. Data were analyzed by Student's t test. Results: Serum concentrations of manganese in morphine-dependent group compared with the control group was significantly lower (p< 0. 05), whereas serum zinc and copper concentrations were significantly higher than the control group (p< 0. 05). Results showed a significant increase in serum copper and zinc concentrations and decrease in serum manganese level in morphine dependent rats. Conclusion: Dependence to morphine may be affecting the status of trace elements in serum of male rats...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{determine}} the prevalence and independent relationship between hearing loss and risk factors in a representative {{neonatal intensive care}} unit (NICU) population. Methods: Automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) hearing screening has been introduced since 1998 in the Dutch NICUs. After a second AABR failure, diagnostic ABR was used to establish diagnosis of hearing loss. Newborns who died {{before the age of}} 3 months were excluded. In the present study only the NICU infants who were born with a gestational age < 30 weeks and/or a birth weight < 1000 g between October 1, 1998 and January 1, 2002 were included. Risk factors included in the study were familial hearing loss, in utero infections, craniofacial anomalies, birth weight < 1500 g, hyperbilirubinemia, ototoxic medications, cerebral complications, severe birth asphyxia, assisted ventilation ≥ 5 <b>days</b> and <b>syndromes.</b> Results: A nationwide cohort of 2186 newborns were included. Mean gestational age was 28. 5 weeks (SD 1. 6) and mean birth weight was 1039 g (SD 256). Prevalence of uni- or bilateral hearing loss was 3. 2 % (71 / 2186; 95 % CI 2. 6 - 4. 1). Multivariate analysis revealed that the only independent risk factors for hearing loss were severe birth asphyxia (OR 1. 7; 95 % CI 1. 0 - 2. 7) and assisted ventilation ≥ 5 days (OR 3. 6; 95 % CI 2. 1 - 6. 0). Conclusion: The prevalence of hearing loss in a representative NICU population was 3. 2 %. Independent risk factors for hearing loss were severe birth asphyxia and assisted ventilation ≥ 5 days. © 2007 The Author(s) ...|$|R
