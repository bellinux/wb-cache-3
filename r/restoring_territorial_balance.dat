Malta and Cyprus, which joined the European Union (EU) in 2004, are small island economies with marginal regional disparities. The main goal of Cohesion policy in these countries has been to assist national growth.

40|$|The {{rational}} use {{of territorial}} resources {{is a key}} factor in achieving sustainability. Spatial planning is an important tool that helps decision makers to achieve sustainability in the long term. This work proposes a multi-objective model for sustainable land use allocation known as MAUSS (Spanish acronym for “Modelo de Asignación de Uso Sostenible de Suelo”) The model was applied to the Plains of San Juan, Puebla, Mexico, which is currently undergoing a rapid industrialization process. The main objective of the model is to generate land use allocations that lead to a <b>territorial</b> <b>balance</b> within regions in three main ways by maximizing income, minimizing negative environmental pressure on water and air through specific evaluations of water use and CO 2 emissions, and minimizing food deficit. The non-sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) is the evolutionary optimization algorithm of MAUSS. NSGA-II has been widely modified through a novel and efficient random initializing operator that enables spatial rationale from the initial solutions, a crossover operator designed to streamline the best genetic information transmission as well as diversity, and two geometric operators, geographic dispersion (GDO) and the proportion (PO), which strengthen spatial rationality. MAUSS provided a more sustainable land use allocation compared to the current land use distribution in terms of higher income, 9 % lower global negative pressure on the environment and 5. 2 % lower food deficit simultaneousl...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Vertebrates show {{a diverse}} array of social {{behaviors}} associated with territoriality. Field and laboratory experiments indicate that underlying themes—including mechanisms—may exist. For example in birds, extensive evidence over many decades has implicated a role for testosterone in the activation of territorial aggression in reproductive contexts. Territoriality at other {{times of the year}} appeared to be independent of gonadal hormone control. One obvious question is—why this diversity of control mechanisms for an apparently similar behavior? Control of testosterone secretion during the breeding season must balance the need to compete with other males (that tends to increase testosterone secretion), and the need to provide parental care (that requires lower testosterone concentrations). Regulation of aggressive behaviors by testosterone in the non-breeding season may incur substantial costs. A series of experiments on the male song sparrow, Melospiza melodia morphna, of western Washington State have revealed possible mechanisms to avoid these costs. Song sparrows are sedentary and defend territories in both breeding and non-breeding seasons. Dominance interactions, territorial aggression and song during the non-breeding season are essen-tially identical to those during the breeding season. Although in the non-breeding season plasma testosterone and estradiol levels are very low, treatment with an aromatase inhibitor decreases aggression and simulta-neous implantation of estradiol <b>restores</b> <b>territorial</b> behavior. These data suggest that the mechanism by which testosterone regulates territorial behavior at the neural level remains intact throughout the year. How the hormonal message to activate such behavior gets to the brain in different season does, however, appear to be different...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} search for new {{relationships}} between indigenous and settler peoples in Australia and Canada. Both reconciliation and the treaty-making process in British Columbia are understood as attempts to build such relationships. Yetthese are policies that have arisen {{in response to the}} persistence of indigenous claims for recognition of rights and respect for identity. Consequently, I consider what the purpose of new relationships might be: is the creation of new relationships to be the means by which settlers recognise and respect indigenous rights and identities, or is there some other goal? To answer this, I analyse the two policies as the opening of negotiations over indigenous claims for recognition. That is, the opening of new political spaces in which indigenous people's voices and claims may be heard. Reconciliation opened a space to rethink Australian attitudes to history and culture, to renegotiate Australian identity. Treaties in British Columbia primarily seek to renegotiate ownership and control of lands and resources. Both policies attempt to relegitimise the polities in which they operate, by making new relationships that provide for mutual recognition. However, the thesis establishes that these new spaces are not nearly as expansive or inclusive as they are made out to be. They are in fact defined by the internal struggles of settler society to make life more certain: to resume identities that are secure and satisfying, and to <b>restore</b> <b>territorial</b> control and economic security. This takes place with little regard for the legitimate claims of indigenous peoples to be recognised as people and to enjoy dynamic, flourishing identities of their own. Building new relationships becomes the path to entrenching old certainties...|$|R
40|$|At {{the door}} of the XXI century, the Agenda 2000 and the {{agreements}} reached at the European Council of Berlin opened the possibility for a new design of European policies. The three fundamental aspects discussed were: the reformulation of Structures Policy, the reformulation of Common Agrarian Policy, and the necessary adjustments for the adaptation to the entrance of new members into the European Union, creating for it a specific financial framework for the period 2000 - 2006. This work shows the evolution and the perspective of the structural financial instruments from the reformation with the objective to achieve greater effectiveness, as well as the necessary assumption of competences and functions {{on the part of the}} members States. On the other hand, it discusses the change tendency that implies to fit agriculture inside a wider socio-economic framework. Indeed, the agrarian sector must not be approached in an isolated manner but rather as an economic activity with an important weight in the development of the different European regions, that have to be favoured to attain <b>territorial</b> <b>balance</b> and economic and social cohesion; which implies the fortification of the rural policy to secure this balance as a fundamental pillar of the Common Agrarian Policy. At this context, co-operative businesses play a crucial role as agents involved in the processes of territorial development, not only due to their dynamics as economic actors but also for their contribution to economic and social cohesion.

40|$|This article {{approaches}} {{aspects of}} spatial patterns associated with underdevelopment situations in Maramureş – Chioar Region, Romania. Based {{on the concept}} according to which <b>territorial</b> <b>balance</b> results from a harmonization between structure and function, the analysis performed considers three territorial aspects: the road network, the economic characteristics and the spatial positioning of the human settlements. The correlated analysis of these aspects allowed capturing certain recurrent spatial situations of association between settlements without business organizations, with a poor road network development. Such situations, translated in terms of space as patterns of underdevelopment, are, due to the big number of cases, a symptom of uneven regional development. We have identified three classes of spatial patterns associated with economic underdevelopment situations: the sidewise pattern, the cul-de-sac pattern, and the proximity pattern. The analysis of network indicators (α, β, γ, μ) and of a compound indicator (κ) reveals in many cases that the identified spatial patterns coincide with low values of road network connectivity. From a systemic point of view, {{the significance of these}} indicators derives from the fact that they signal dysfunctions manifested at structural and functional level. The optimization of the patterns of underdevelopment requires both a harmonious relationship between road network meshes and nodes and an efficient network flow transmission, i. e. an optimization between time, space and consumed energy factors. Under these conditions, the emergence of new structural elements and network segments that will close the non-functional network meshes can be a possible solution that might eliminate underdevelopment situations by increasing the positional value of these settlements...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looks at}} {{the way that the}} European states system {{operated}} and affected the Ottoman-Russian relations between 1815 and 1856. The 1815 Settlements established a new system of international relations in Europe. Russia played the greatest role in foiling the Napoleonic bid for hegemony. The most distinguishing characteristic of this new system was that its structure made cooperation effective {{within the framework of the}} institution of Concert of Europe. In this respect the four victorious great powers, i. e. Russia, England, Prussia and Austria, did not exclude the defeated power, France, and they took on the governance of international affairs. The new system was built on the political and <b>territorial</b> <b>balance.</b> To this end, the restriction of France and moderation of Russia was necessary. Both countries had some revisionist objectives. Consequently, Near East became the centre stage of the international politics after 1815. Ottoman Empire did not take part in the 1815 Settlements. Therefore, Ottoman-Russian relations were to continue on a bilateral base. Russia's strategic goal to secure her south-east frontiers clashed with her responsibility for maintaining the provisions of 1815 Settlements in Central Europe since any change in Near East would affect the <b>territorial</b> and political <b>balance</b> in Central Europe, too. Under these circumstances, Russia faced a dilemma in her relations with the Ottoman Empire. Russia was very advantageous owing to her enormous power and her treaty rights regarding the Ottoman Empire which had acquired since 1774. Ottoman-Russian relations developed around three main events during 1815 - 1856 : the revolt of Greeks (1821 - 29), the rebellion of Viceroy of Egypt (1833 and 1839) and the Holy Place Issue (1852 - 1854). In all those events Russia was successfully restrained against the Ottoman Empire by the structure of the new system. The thesis draws a number of conclusions. The underlying economic structure of the new state system almost remained the same during the 1815 - 1856 period. The thesis concludes that the course of Ottoman-Russian relations was increasingly determined by the elements of relationship structure. In particular, the foreign policy objectives of France played the significant role in shaping the Ottoman-Russian relations during 1815 - 1856.

In other words, recovery is a subject which solves the probable damages of a building, trying to bring it back to its original living conditions; otherwise referring to the intervention which confronts the damages provoked by the weather and, more often than not, by the absence of maintenance. In any case, technological innovation can intervene systematically basing itself on analytic and diagnostic studies, regulated and supported by new scientific instruments. The project of building recovery and heritage enhancement, therefore, mainly addresses the adjustment to new housing and urban needs, but it is obviously conditioned and/or “restricted” by the limitation of the building itself, in particular when the intrinsic characteristics must be preserved.
