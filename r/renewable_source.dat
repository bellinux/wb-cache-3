The aim of the thesis is to examine the legal background of <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> in the law of European Union and the Czech law. <b>Renewable</b> <b>sources</b> of energy are fundamental instrument to deal with such challenges as environmental protection, climate change and energy security. Author outlines importance of the support schemes and the recent development of the solar power in the Czech Republic. The thesis is composed of five chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> of energy. Chapter one is introductory and deals with general introduction to the <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> of energy. The chapter is subdivided into two parts. Part one focuses on general description of energy sources that can be divided on renewable and non <b>renewable</b> <b>sources.</b> This part also describes general advantages and disadvantages of the use of <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> of energy. Part Two investigates actual use of the biofuels and use of the <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> of energy for the production of electricity, both in the European Union and the Czech Republic.

40|$|The Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} the {{comparison}} of use of <b>renewable</b> energy <b>sources</b> in the Czech Republic and in the Republic of Austria {{in the period of}} 2004 - 2015. The thesis analyzes the particular <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> from the efficiency point of view, {{as well as from the}} point of view of their share on total gross energy consumption. The issue of <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> is considered to be a very insistent topic politically, economically and environmentally. Both countries are governed by the European Union legislation, which has been very intensively focusing on the energy policy, and which determines a large scale of obligations for all the EU member states. The theoretical part is dedicated to the specifications of <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> and their development in both the countries since 2004. The first part describes the legislative development of <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> in the both countries and from the perspective of the European Union. The next part compares the retail and wholesale electricity prices in both the countries. In the end of the theoretical part I am describing the coherence between <b>renewable</b> <b>sources,</b> sustainable development and the environmental theory. The practical part contains an analysis of the total current use of particular <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> in the Czech Republic and in Austria. It provides the analysis of the future development of <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> and describes the both countries visions that aim to increase the share of <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> of the total energy consumption. The outcome of this Bachelors thesis is a comparative analysis of <b>renewable</b> <b>sources,</b> which, based on the mentioned data, demonstrates an objective comparison of both the power industries in this area. Using the data comparison methodology, it becomes obvious that the share <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> of the total gross electricity consumption achieves 70 percent in Austria, while only 14 percent in the Czech Republic. This Bachelors thesis provides an analysis of the current status of <b>renewable</b> <b>sources</b> in both the national power industries, as well as the economic insight on the green energy in neighbouring countries...|$|R

The first fair trade agricultural products were tea and coffee, quickly followed by: dried fruits, cocoa, sugar, fruit juices, rice, spices and nuts. While in 1992, a sales value ratio of 80% handcrafts to 20% agricultural goods was the norm, in 2002 handcrafts amounted to 25% of fair trade sales while commodity food lines were up at 69%.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} legal instruments {{for the promotion}} of renewable energy are Law 25,019 from 1998 and Law 26,190 from 2007. The 1998 law, known as the “National Wind and Solar Energy Rules”, declared wind and solar generation of national interest and introduced a mechanism that established an additional payment per generated kWh which, in 1998, meant a 40% premium over market price. It also granted certain tax exemptions for a period of 15 years from the law's promulgation. The 2007 Law complemented the previous one, declaring of national interest the generation of electricity from any <b>renewable</b> <b>source</b> intended to deliver a public service. This law also set an 8% target for renewable energy consumption in the period of 10 years and mandated the creation of a trust fund whose resources will be allocated to pay a premium for electricity produced from renewable sources.|$|E
25|$|The {{efficiency}} of any system {{depends on the}} definition of the boundaries of the system. For an electrical energy customer the {{efficiency of}} electric space heating is almost 100% because almost all purchased energy is converted to building heat (the only exception being fan noise and indication lights which demand very little electricity and virtually none at all when compared to the extremely large energy draw of the heating itself). However, if a power plant supplying electricity is included, the overall efficiency drops drastically. For example, a fossil-fuel power station may only deliver 3 units of electrical energy for every 10 units of fuel energy released. Even though the electric heater is 100% efficient, the amount of fuel needed to produce electric heat is more than if the fuel was burned in a furnace or boiler at the building being heated. If the same fuel could be used for space heating by a consumer, it would be more efficient overall to burn the fuel at the end user's building. On the other hand, replacing electric heating with fossil fuel burning heaters, isn't necessary good as it removes the ability to have renewable electric heating, this can be achieved by sourcing the electricity from a <b>renewable</b> <b>source.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Depending on the agency, peat is not {{generally}} regarded as a <b>renewable</b> <b>source</b> of energy, due to its extraction rate in industrialized countries far exceeding its slow regrowth rate of 1mm per year, and as it is also reported that peat regrowth takes place only in 30-40% of peatlands. Because of this, the UNFCCC, and another organization affiliated with the United Nations classified peat as a fossil fuel. However, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has begun to classify peat as a [...] "slow-renewable" [...] fuel. This is also the classification used {{by many in the}} peat industry.

2500|$|The United States has {{inconsistent}} {{energy generation}} policies across its 50 states. State energy policies and laws may vary significantly with location.

[...] For this purpose, renewable sources include wind, hydroelectric, and solar power whether from large or microgeneration projects. [...] Further, in some areas transferrable [...] "renewable source energy" [...] credits are needed by power companies to meet these mandates. As a result, in some portions of the United States, power companies will pay a portion of the cost of <b>renewable</b> <b>source</b> microgeneration projects in their service areas. These rebates are in addition to any Federal or State renewable-energy income-tax credits that may be applicable. [...] In other areas, such rebates may differ or may not be available.|$|E
