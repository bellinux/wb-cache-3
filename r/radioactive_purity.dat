40|$|A {{solution}} of Th‐ 234 from Uranyle nitrate {{was prepared for}} the use as tracer of its α emitting isotopes Th‐ 230, 228, 232. The aim of the work was to obtain Th‐ 234 containing {{as little as possible}} α emitting elements. U was separated from Th by ether extraction. The impurities present in the {{solution of}} Th‐ 234 are: — U due to incomplete separation. — Th‐ 230 growing from U‐ 234 and chemically inseparable frm U‐ 234 — U‐ 234 formed by desintegration of Th‐ 230 The most favourable conditions for obtaining a solution of Th‐ 234 with high <b>radioactive</b> <b>purity</b> are discussed. The preparation of a Th‐ 234 solution with a ratio α β < 1, 8 10 − 6 is described in detail. This solution can be used as radiotracer in measuring quantities of Th‐ 230 (Ionium) as low as 10 − 11 g.

40|$|International audienceGallium- 68 {{has a high}} {{potential}} for clinical positron emission tomography (PET) because of its 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator based production. Unfortunately, during elution of the gallium- 68, generators usually display a germanium- 68 breakthrough which consequently limits their use in a clinical context. To be more precise, usually used crude anatase presents fragile edges which can split and be co-eluted from the generator during gallium- 68 recovery, resulting in metal and germanium- 68 contaminations. The addition of a sonication step during the production process of titania induces more resistant smoothened particles which were packed in a quartz glass column to give a novel 68 Ge/ 68 Ga generator. The performance of the system (elution profile, elution yield and germanium- 68 breakthrough) was determined and followed-up {{over a period of}} nine months in terms of reliability and efficiency so as to produce high quality gallium- 68 and to radiolabel DOTA-peptides. Elution of gallium- 68 from the generator was achieved with a constant yield (≈ 67 ± 5 %) and a 68 Ge/ 68 Ga ratio typically lower than 2. 0 × 10 − 7 which is about 20 fold less than the values observed using crude titania. Moreover, fully automated processes that involved a fractionated elution or a cation exchange preconcentration of gallium- 68 were realized. [68 Ga]-radiotracer production occurred in less than 20 min with a marked radiochemical purity (> 97 %) and yield (80 – 90 %, decay-corrected). We have shown experimentally that smoothened anatase based systems generated high quality gallium- 68 which was successfully used for the labeling of DOTA-peptides in considerable radiochemical yields and <b>radioactive</b> <b>purity</b> throughout its expected life...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{effective}} {{specific activity}} of a radioisotope is an indirect and highly useful {{way to describe}} a <b>radioactive</b> sample’s <b>purity.</b> A high effective specific activity combines {{the concept of an}} isotopically pure product with suitability via selectivity of a particular chelating body. The primary goals of this work are twofold: 1) To determine which metallic impurities have the largest impact on the effective specific activity for a given chelator, and 2) to form a model based on the binding affinities of each metal for to calculate a ‘theoretical effective specific activ-ity’ from broad band trace metal analysis. If successful, this information can be used to guide the production of high specific activity products through the systematic elimination of high-impact metallic impurities. Material and Methods Phosphor plate thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used to measure the effective specific activ-ity of 64 Cu by NOTA and DOTA, and 89 Zr by des-feral (DF). Typical measured effective specific activities are 2 – 5 Ci/μmol for 64 Cu and 1 – 2 Ci/μmol for 89 Zr. Samples were created containing increasing cod competitive burdens (X) of CuCl 2, ZnCl 2, FeCl 2, NiCl 2, CrCl 3, CoCl 2, MnCl 2, and YCl 3. Standard concentrations were measured by microwave plasma atomic emission spectrometry. 50 pmol of NOTA, DOTA, or DF were added following the activity aliquots of 64 Cu or 89 Zr. Labeling efficien-cies (64 Cu-NOTA, 64 Cu-DOTA, 89 Zr-DF) were measured using TLC’s, and were fit by linear regression to the form f(X) = b/(1 − AX), where A is the chelation affinity (inverse of dissociation constant) and X is the molar ratio of the metallic impurity to the amount of chelator. Results and Conclusion Affinity of Zr for DF was assumed to be unity, while the affinities of Cu for NOTA and DOTA were explicitly measured and were found to be 0. 93 ± 0. 13 and 5. 2 ± 3. 2 respectively. It was found that Cu had the highest affinity for NOTA by a factor of 266, and that Zr had the highest affinity for DF by a factor of 40. •	In order of decreasing affinity to NOTA: Cu, Zn, Fe, Co, Cr, Y, and Ni •	In order of decreasing affinity to DOTA: Cu, Y, Zn, Co, Ni, Cr, and Fe •	In order of decreasing affinity to DF: Zr, Y, Cu, Zn, Ni, Fe, Co, Cr These results suggest that aside from the carrier element it is most important to remove zinc from 64 Cu products prior to chelation with NOTA and yttrium from 64 Cu and 89 Zr products prior to chelation with DOTA and DF, respectively. Therefore, it is logical to believe that 89 Zr effective specific activities could be greatly improved by secondary separations with the goal of re-moving additional yttrium target material. Chelation affinities of NOTA, DOTA, and DF for several common metals have successfully been investigated. These values will guide our future attempts to provide high effective specific activity 64 ¬Cu and 89 Zr. Furthermore, a preliminary model has been formed to calculate effective specific activity from the quantitative broad band analysis of trace metals. Future work will include chelator affinity measurements for other likely contaminants, such as scandium, titanium, zirconium, molybdenum, niobium, gold, gallium, and germanium. Details will be presented...|$|R
