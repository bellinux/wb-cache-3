25|$|In {{catalytic}} reforming, {{a mixture}} of hydrocarbons with boiling points between 60–200°C is blended with hydrogen gas and then exposed to a bifunctional platinum chloride or rhenium chloride catalyst at 500–525°C and pressures ranging from 8–50 atm. Under these conditions, aliphatic hydrocarbons form rings and lose hydrogen to become aromatic hydrocarbons. The aromatic products of the reaction are then separated from the reaction mixture (or <b>reformate)</b> by extraction with any {{one of a number}} of solvents, including diethylene glycol or sulfolane, and benzene is then separated from the other aromatics by distillation. The extraction step of aromatics from the <b>reformate</b> is designed to produce aromatics with lowest non-aromatic components. Recovery of the aromatics, commonly referred to as BTX (benzene, toluene and xylene isomers), involves such extraction and distillation steps. There are a good many licensed processes available for extraction of the aromatics.|$|E

50|$|The bottoms {{product from}} the {{stabilizer}} is the high-octane liquid <b>reformate</b> {{that will become}} {{a component of the}} refinery's product gasoline.Reformate can be blended directly in the gasoline pool but often it is separated in two or more streams. A common refining scheme consists in fractionating the <b>reformate</b> in two streams, light and heavy <b>reformate.</b> The light <b>reformate</b> has lower octane and can be used as isomerization feedstock if this unit is available. The heavy <b>reformate</b> is high in octane and low in benzene, hence it is an excellent blending component for the gasoline pool.|$|E

50|$|Catalytic {{reformer}} unit is used {{to convert}} the naphtha-boiling range molecules into higher octane <b>reformate</b> (reformer product). The <b>reformate</b> has higher content of aromatics and cyclic hydrocarbons. An important byproduct of a reformer is hydrogen released during the catalyst reaction. The hydrogen is used either in the hydrotreaters or the hydrocracker.|$|E
