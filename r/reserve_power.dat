40|$|Summary of Invention In {{accordance}} with {{an aspect of}} the invention there is provided a method for allocating a plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> to deliver <b>power</b> to a power network to meet a <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement for balancing a frequency of the power network. The method comprises obtaining, for a plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> of a <b>power</b> network, <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> flexibility characteristics associated with each <b>power</b> <b>reserve.</b> The method further comprises obtaining, for the plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves,</b> an indexing value associated with the delivery of power by each of the <b>power</b> <b>reserves.</b> The method further comprises determining a <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement associated with the power network. The method further comprises assigning {{one or more of the}} plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> to deliver <b>power</b> to the power network, the plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> assigned in {{accordance with}} the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> flexibility characteristics associated with each of the <b>power</b> <b>reserves,</b> the indexing value associated with each of the <b>power</b> <b>reserves,</b> and the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement associated with the power network. The <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> flexibility characteristics may be indicative of power deliverable to the power network by the respective <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> with respect to time. The <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> flexibility characteristics may include characteristics of positive and/or negative <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> flexibility. The <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> flexibility characteristics may include one or more of a maximum deliverable power, a period of time to provide the maximum deliverable power from receipt of an instruction for power delivery, a minimum duration for sustaining the maximum deliverable power and a period of time to reduce power delivery from the maximum deliverable power to a minimum deliverable power. The assigning of one or more of the plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> may further comprise selecting one or more of the plurality <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> to provide the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement in order of the indexing value associated with the <b>power</b> <b>reserve.</b> The method may further comprise ordering the <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> in accordance with the indexing value associated with each <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> prior to selecting the one or more <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> to provide the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement. The assigning of one or more of the plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> may further comprise determining a portion of the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement of the power network provided by each selected <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> in accordance with the respective <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> flexibility characteristics of the <b>power</b> <b>reserves.</b> Assigning the one or more <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> may further comprise determining if, for a particular instance in time, the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement is met by the assigned one or more <b>power</b> <b>reserves,</b> assigning a next <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> to deliver <b>power</b> to the power network if the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement is not met, the next <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> determined from the order of the indexing values associated with the respective <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> and adjusting a power to be delivered to the power network by a most recently allocated reserve of the one or more <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> that have been assigned to provide power at that instant in time to a level of power sufficient to meet the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement at that instant in time if the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement is met. The power to be delivered by the most recently allocated reserve may be adjusted by subtracting the difference between the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement at that instant in time and a summation of a power to be delivered at that instant in time by each of the <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> assigned to deliver power at that instant in time from the power to be delivered at that instant in time by the most recently allocated reserve assigned to deliver power at that instant in time. Assigning the one or more <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> may further comprise determining if the one or more assigned <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> provide the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement, continuing assigning the <b>reserves</b> if the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement is not met and stopping the assigning the <b>reserves</b> if the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement is met. The method may further comprise determining, prior to assigning one or more of the <b>power</b> <b>reserves,</b> whether or not the plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> will be able to provide the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement from the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> flexibility characteristics associated with the plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves.</b> The <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement associated with the power network may be a power required to be delivered to the network over a period of time. The <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement associated with a power network may be determined by estimating a <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement associated with the power network. The <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> flexibility characteristics may be obtained from a memory. The indexing value may be obtained from a memory. The method may further comprise receiving the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> flexibility characteristics and receiving the indexing values. The <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> flexibility characteristics associated with the <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> may be received from the respective <b>power</b> <b>reserves.</b> The method may further comprise instructing the <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> to deliver <b>power</b> in accordance with the assignment of the <b>power</b> <b>reserves.</b> A <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> may be a power generator or a power load. The indexing value may be a financial cost associated with the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> delivering the <b>power.</b> The indexing value may be an environmental impact associated with the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> delivering the <b>power.</b> In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided an apparatus for allocating a plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> to deliver <b>power</b> to a power network to meet a <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement of the power network. The apparatus comprises a processor arranged to perform any method disclosed herein. The apparatus may be a central controller associated with management of the power network. In accordance with another aspect of the invention there is provided a computer readable medium comprising computer readable code operable, in use, to instruct a computer to perform any method disclosed herein. According to {{an aspect of the}} invention there is provided a method for allocating <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> in a <b>power</b> network. The method comprises determining a <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement associated with the power network. The method then comprises assigning <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> associated with the network to deliver power for meeting the <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement, the <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> assigned according to an indexing value associated with delivery of power by respective <b>power</b> <b>reserves.</b> Throughout this disclosure it will be understood that each indexing value assigned to a <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> may correspond to a financial cost associated with that reserve. According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a method for allocating <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> in a <b>power</b> network. The method comprises determining a <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement associated with the power network. The method then comprises assigning <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> associated with the network for meeting the determined <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement, the <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> assigned according to a power response characteristic associated with each of the <b>power</b> <b>reserves.</b> According to a further aspect of the invention a method for allocating power resources provided by a plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> in a <b>power</b> network to meet a <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement of the power network is provided. The method comprises obtaining, for a plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves,</b> information indicative of power response characteristics associated with power resources provided by the respective <b>power</b> <b>reserves.</b> The method also comprises obtaining, for the plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves,</b> information indicative of an indexing value associated with the power resources provided by the respective <b>power</b> <b>reserves.</b> In addition, the method comprises determining a <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> requirement associated with a power network. The method also comprises assigning one or more power resources provided by the plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> in accordance with the power response characteristics and the indexing value associated with each power resource provided by the plurality of <b>power</b> <b>reserves</b> to provide the power resource requirement. The power response characteristic may be considered as a deliverable power response of a <b>power</b> <b>reserve.</b> Also the <b>power</b> response characteristic may be considered as a mapping of the highest power and longest duration positive and negative power response with respect to time associated with a <b>power</b> <b>reserve.</b> Such a system of mapping of <b>power</b> <b>reserve</b> supply and reserve requirement allows for simple description of any flexible resource, intermittent source or frequency service regardless of their particular dynamic response. Once the method is complete, the reserve requirement may be fully accounted for by the cumulative supply provided by the least expensive available reserves. The method may be applicable to forecasted worst-case intermittency, or can be applied to state of the art frequency control services such that reserves are allocated to individual FCR, FRR or RR services. The cumulative supply can be decomposed to determine and share cost of intermittency. The method may provide intuitive visual reserve adequacy assessment and user input allocation via a user interface. The methods described herein allow for available resources to be used to their fullest which can bring down the price of reserves and may lead to a significant cost reduction for the various system operators by enlarging the pool of available reserves. A system for defining resources irrespective of type is disclosed. Consequently, a single definition system is provided to identify the power characteristics of flexible resources, intermittent resources, or frequency services regardless of their particular dynamic response. A system that enables a user to be provided with a visual reserve adequacy assessment and reserve distribution is disclosed...|$|R

Therefore, each ship has to fill out an Energy Allocation form {{at the beginning of a}} turn, and 'pay' for all the functions (such as movement, shields and weapons) that it can then use during the turn. This procedure forces players to plan their actions for the following game turn, because systems left unpowered during the Energy Allocation Phase cannot be used during the turn (there is a rule for <b>Reserve</b> <b>Power</b> which a player can use to power up a ship system mid-turn, but this power comes from the ship's batteries which are few).|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Smith and Dupont arrived at Government House to see Gibbs, Whitehall had {{instructed}} the Governor to formally dismiss Smith and his ministers for treason.

The Rhodesian government hoped that Gibbs might obligingly resign {{in light of his}} impotent situation, but he did not; following orders from London, he remained at his post at Government House. Gibbs told the Rhodesian military's senior officers, some of whom were troubled by the perceived choice between Queen and country, to remain at their posts to maintain law and order. Wilson briefly flirted with the idea of sending Lord Mountbatten to Rhodesia to support Gibbs as a direct representative of the Queen, but this was dropped after Gibbs asked for somebody [...] "higher up" [...] in the royal family instead. [...] "Not likely", Wilson retorted.|$|E

Some constitutional scholars, such as George Winterton, have stated that <b>reserve</b> <b>powers</b> are a good thing in that they allow for a head of state to handle an unforeseen crisis and that the use of convention to limit the use of <b>reserve</b> <b>powers</b> allows for more gradual and subtle constitutional evolution than is possible through formal amendment of a written constitution.

It will come home plus the whole cost of collecting the tax, and plus, further, the inconvenience and burden of the network of taxation which is needed. It will come home to them, if they be consumers, in the quantity, quality, or price of the articles they consume, and, if exporters, in the profit, convenience, or <b>reserve</b> <b>power</b> of the business which they conduct.|$|E

He was stouter than when I had seen him at Waterloo, and there was a gentleness of expression which I had never seen in life. On either side of him burned rows of candles, and this was the beacon which had welcomed us at sea, which had guided me over the water, and which I had hailed as my star of hope. Dimly I became conscious that many people were kneeling in the room; the little Court, men and women, who had shared his fortunes, Bertrand, his wife, the priest, Montholon--all were there. I would have prayed too, but my heart was too heavy and bitter for prayer. And yet I must leave, and I could not leave him without a sign.

Here, in the luncheon interval, were all species of female and one species of male hat, protecting the multiple types of face associated with [...] "the classes." [...] The observing Forsyte might discern in the free or unconsidered seats a certain number of the squash-hatted, but they hardly ventured on the grass; the old school--or schools--could still rejoice that the proletariat was not yet paying the necessary half-crown.

6000|$|The weeks which {{followed}} {{the death of}} his father were sad and empty to the only Jolyon Forsyte left. The necessary forms and ceremonies--the reading of the Will, valuation of the estate, distribution of the legacies--were enacted over the head, as it were, of one not yet of age. Jolyon was cremated. By his special wish no one attended that ceremony, or wore black for him. The succession of his property, controlled to some extent by old Jolyon's Will, left his widow in possession of Robin Hill, with two thousand five hundred pounds a year for life. Apart from this the two Wills worked together in some complicated way to insure that each of Jolyon's three children should have an equal share in their grandfather's and father's property in the future as in the present, save only that Jon, by virtue of his sex, would have control of his capital when he was twenty-one, while June and Holly would only have the spirit of theirs, in order that their children might have the body after them. If they had no children, it would all come to Jon if he outlived them; and since June was fifty, and Holly nearly forty, it was considered in Lincoln's Inn Fields that but for the cruelty of income tax, young Jon would be as warm a man as his grandfather when he died. All this was nothing to Jon, and little enough to his mother. It was June who did everything needful for one who had left his affairs in perfect order. When she had gone, and those two were alone again in the great house, alone with death drawing them together, and love driving them apart, Jon passed very painful days secretly disgusted and disappointed with himself. His mother would look at him with a patient sadness which yet had in it an instinctive pride, as if she were reserving her defence. If she smiled he was angry that his answering smile should be so grudging and unnatural. He did not judge or condemn her; that was all too remote--indeed, the idea of doing so had never come to him. No! he was grudging and unnatural because he couldn't have what he wanted because of her. There was one alleviation--much to do in connection with his father's career, which could not be safely intrusted to June, though she had offered to undertake it. Both Jon and his mother had felt that if she took his portfolios, unexhibited drawings and unfinished matter, away with her, the work would encounter such icy blasts from Paul Post and other frequenters of her studio, that it would soon be frozen out even of her warm heart. On its old-fashioned plane and of its kind the work was good, and they could not bear the thought of its subjection to ridicule. A one-man exhibition of his work was the least testimony they could pay to one they had loved; and on preparation for this they spent many hours together. Jon came to have a curiously increased respect for his father. The quiet tenacity with which he had converted a mediocre talent into something really individual was disclosed by these researches. There was a great mass of work with a rare continuity of growth in depth and reach of vision. Nothing certainly went very deep, or reached very high--but such as the work was, it was thorough, conscientious, and complete. And, remembering his father's utter absence of [...] "side" [...] or self-assertion, the chaffing humility with which he had always spoken of his own efforts, ever calling himself [...] "an amateur," [...] Jon could not help feeling that he had never really known his father. To take himself seriously, yet never bore others by letting them know that he did so, seemed to have been his ruling principle. There was something in this which appealed to the boy, and made him heartily indorse his mother's comment: [...] "He had true refinement; he couldn't help thinking of others, whatever he did. And when he took a resolution which went counter, he did it with the minimum of defiance--not like the Age, is it?
