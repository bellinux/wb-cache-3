Awnings with sides are {{commonly known as}} traditional style awnings as they have been used for many years dating back to the early 19th century using cotton canvas fabric. Canvas was replaced in the 1960s by more acrylic materials and polyester in more recent times driven by a focus on the environment. Traditional style awnings are appropriate for historical buildings and are still popular today using a more weather resistant fabric such as a solution dyed acrylic fabric such as Sunbrella Fabric and a rope and pulley system for retracting the awnings. Awnings without sides do not provide as much sun protection as those with sides. Awnings without sides come in many different styles. Drop Arm Awnings without sides come with roller tubes at the top and are available with motors and wind sensors for automatic retraction. Spear Awnings are made without sides and are made with Wrought Iron Frames and they can be retracted with a rope and pulley system but are not available with motors.|$|E

Multiplication of the virus on roller tubes showed similar sequences to multiplication in chorioallantoic cavities of embryonated eggs, irrespective of inoculum doses. For the cultivation of influenza virus, minced chorioallantoic membrane seemed to give the results as compared to minced bodies or minced brains of chick embryo.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{invasive}} properties of bacteria have frequently been studied {{by the use}} of HeLa cell cultures in chamber slides, using microscopic examination to enumerate intracellular bacteria. When this system was used to examine invasive properties of Yersinia enterocolitica, it resulted in rapid internalization of high numbers of bacteria during the infection phase which prevented subsequent discrimination of intracellular multiplication. A modified procedure was developed which standardized the ratio of bacteria to HeLa cells (i. e., multiplicity), the time for the infection phase, and the addition of specific antiserum with gentamicin for restricting bacterial uptake during the intracellular growth phase. Studies with this modified chamber slide system found that strains of human isolates of Y. enterocolitica (serotypes O: 3, O: 8, O: 5, 27, and O: 6, 30) exhibited different degrees of cell infection but did not multiply intracellularly.

40|$|SUMMARY Human jejunal biopsy slices were {{maintained}} in culture {{for up to}} 48 hours. At 24 hours there was good morphological preservation but by 48 hours there was ultrastructural evidence of damage to the enterocytes. During culture the tissue had lost {{a certain amount of}} protein. At the same time the levels of three brush border enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, a-glucosidase, and leucyl-p-naphthylamidase) and one lysosomal enzyme (N-acetyl-fl-glucosaminidase) showed a progressive decrease. Alkaline phosphatase, x-glucosidase, and N-acetyl-,B-glucosaminidase accumu-lated in the medium throughout the experimental period to give a medium:tissue distribution ratio of between 2 and 9. Leucyl-,B-naphthylamidase had a medium:tissue ratio of 140 after 48 hours of culture suggesting a selective secretion of this enzyme by the tissue.

40|$|The Cowden {{strain of}} porcine group C {{rotavirus}} (pararotavirus) was adapted to serial passage {{in a continuous}} monkey kidney cell line (MA 104). Key factors in its successful adaptation included use of virus passaged in primary porcine kidney cells as the initial inoculum, use of <b>roller</b> <b>tubes,</b> and addition of pancreatin to the maintenance medium. A cell culture immunofluorescence {{test was used to}} quantitate the virus at each passage level, since a possible cytopathic effect was obscured by the effects of pancreatin. The virus titers dropped after initial passage into MA 104 cells but increased thereafter, with peak titers evident after 16 passages (10 (7) immunofluorescence U/ml). Immune electron microscopy and genome electropherotyping were used to identify group C rotavirus particles and confirm group C rotavirus double-stranded RNA gel migration patterns, respectively, from infected cell culture supernatants. The electropherotype of the cell culture-propagated group C rotavirus was identical to that of the gut virulent virus from which it was derived. The cell culture-passaged group C rotavirus also retained its infectivity for gnotobiotic pigs. No group A rotavirus was detected in the intestinal contents of the pigs or in cell culture fluids from group C rotavirus-inoculated monolayers with the two former techniques or the cell culture immunofluorescence test.

Four strains of toxigenic E. coli known to elaborate both heat-labile enterotoxin and ST or ST alone were used to study these parameters. ST activity after heat treatment and the effect of purified choleragen were also examined. ST production was optimal in Casamino Acids-yeast extract media, but both Trypticase soy and brain heart infusion broths resulted in several false negative reactions. Growing cultures in <b>roller</b> <b>tubes</b> was the most reliable method of ST production.

40|$|Cells {{disaggregated}} from slugs of Dictyostelium discoideum were cultured in Bonner's {{salt solution}} in <b>roller</b> <b>tubes.</b> Cells rapidly stuck {{together to form}} an amorphous loose agglutinate which was later transformed into a spheroidal tight agglutinate surrounded by slime sheath material. Prespore cells in the loose agglutinate underwent partial dedifferentiation by starting to decompose their specific antigen until formation of the tight agglutinate, in which the antigen was resynthesized. During the process, there was some decrease {{in the proportion of}} prespore cells. Changes in the distribution of prespore and prestalk cells in the agglutinates were examined by using immunocytochemical staining. They were randomly distributed in the early agglutin-ates, but became well separated in 4 h agglutinates {{in such a way that}} prestalk cells were com-pletely enveloped by prespore cells. Prestalk cells later came outside to be partially enveloped and finally occupied a hemisphere side by side with prespore cells. During the process, cells in one or two outer layers differentiated into prestalk or stalk cells. Similar changes in the dis-tribution pattern were observed, when labelled prestalk cells were cultured with unlabelled prespore cells and their distribution in co-agglutinates was followed by autoradiography. It was concluded from these results that the majorities of prestalk and prespore cells isolated from slugs are sorted out in agglutinates without changing their original cell types, and that the sorting-out occurs in the complete absence of polar structures and movement of the cell mass. The distribution patterns in agglutinates of prestalk and prespore cells were discussed with reference to intercellular adhesion among/between them...|$|R

The findings are interpreted as probably reflecting differences in inter-feron production or virus adsorption between the tumor lines studied, which will be further investigated. -J Nat Cancer Inst 31 : 1525 - 1532, 1963. MOST mouse polyoma tumors studied have shown some resistance to the cytopathogenic effect (OPE) of polyoma virus infection, as compared to embryonic cells, even though some lines were equally as susceptible as embryonic cells (1, 2), The resistance varied in degree for different polyoma tumors and also for different sublines established from single cells isolated from the same tumor (2, 3). No consistent differences in virus sensitivity have been detected between polyoma tumors and neo-plasms of other etiology (2, 3). As one step in analyzing the mechanism of resistance to the OPE of polyoma virus, we were interested in whether increased resistance to polyoma was correlated with increased resistance to other viruses.

40|$|In {{the first}} paper, {{the results of}} {{experiments}} are presented, in which {{an attempt was made}} to develope methods of cytoloyical observation and tissue culture techniques suitable for the morphological studies on Yoshida sarcoma cells in tissue culture. In the present experiments it was established that the method of cell-suspension culture was the most suitable one for such studies. Advantages of this method of tissue culture are as follows: 1) It enables us to observe minute cell structures by phase-contrast microscopy; 2) it is easy to count cell number; 3) it is possible to evaluate cellular activity; and 4) it enables us to take out cells in culture easily and to conduct various cytological studies, such as routine staining, peroxidase reaction, supra-vital staining and carbon particle phagocytosis of these cells. Next, conditions of the medium necessary for the the survival and growth of Yoshida sarcoma cells were investigated. It was found that the suitable conditions of the medium were, pH 7. 2 - 7. 4, glucose solution at the concentration of 150 mg/dl, 44 % Hank's solution, 19 % chick embryo extract, 29 % horse serum, 8 % Yoshida sarcoma ascites (extract), 0. 8 mg/ml RNA, and 0. 8 γ/ml vitamin B(12).
