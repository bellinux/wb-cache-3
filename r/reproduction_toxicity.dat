40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from two ring-tests addressing the feasibility, robustness and reproducibility of a <b>reproduction</b> <b>toxicity</b> test with the freshwater gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis (RENILYS strain). Sixteen laboratories (from inexperienced to expert laboratories in mollusc testing) from nine countries participated in these ring-tests. Survival and reproduction were evaluated in L. stagnalis exposed to cadmium, tributyltin, prochloraz and trenbolone according to an OECD draft OECD Test Guideline. In total, 49 datasets were analysed to assess the practicability of the proposed experimental protocol, and to estimate the between-laboratory reproducibility of toxicity endpoint values. The statistical analysis of count data (number of clutches or eggs per individual-day) leading to ECx estimation was specifically developed and automated through a free web-interface. Based on a complementary statistical analysis, the optimal test duration was established and the most sensitive and cost-effective <b>reproduction</b> <b>toxicity</b> endpoint was identified, {{to be used as}} the core endpoint. This validation process and the resulting optimized protocol were used to consolidate the OECD Test Guideline for the evaluation of reproductive effects of chemicals in L. stagnalis...|$|E

If exposures are less than those that cause significant cholinesterase depression, then no signs or symptoms related to chlorpyrifos exposure occur.

40|$|Numerous {{animal studies}} are {{required}} under the EU program on Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH). Developmental and reproductive toxicity studies {{are expected to}} be the major cost factor and the major consumer of animals. Thus, there is great necessity to develop new alternative testing strategies. One opportunity may be the replacement of the conventional two-generation <b>reproduction</b> <b>toxicity</b> study (OECD 416) by the recently implemented extended one generation <b>reproduction</b> <b>toxicity</b> study (EOGRTS, OECD guideline 443). Existing animal data can be integrated in the process of development by validation of alternative methods. The Fraunhofer Fertility and Developmental Toxicity in experimental animals database (FeDTex DB) currently covers 269 chemicals with 535 developmental and <b>reproduction</b> <b>toxicity</b> studies conducted in rodents and rabbits during the last three decades. Comparing the generation NOELs of multi-generation reproduction studies, the F 1 generation was identified as most responsive. In contrast, the NOEL of the F 2 generation was lower than the F 1 NOEL only in 10 % of the studies. The detailed analysis of the underlying effects in these studies left only 3 studies, where the LOEL of F 2 was lower than in F 1 or F 0. Additionally, the observed F 1 -effects would clearly have triggered mating of F 1 in an EOGRTS design. Thus, the impact of the F 2 generation on the study NOEL is low and critical effects would not have been missed following the EOGRTS protocol. Furthermore, an impaired F 1 -fertility was only observed in 5 studies at the study LOEL. In all these studies, effects on reproductive organs or an impaired fertility were already adequately detected in F 0. In conclusion, studies following the EOGRTS protocol may serve as an alternative in toxicity testing strategies...|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} monitor PAC {{availability}} to the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus during 28 days {{of exposure to}} spiked sediments, {{in order to obtain}} reliable chronic effect concentrations for <b>reproduction.</b> Sediment <b>toxicity</b> tests were performed using three pairs of PAC isomers: two homocyclic compounds (anthracene and phenanthrene), two azaarenes (acridine and phenanthridine), and the two main transformation products of the azaarenes (acridone and phenanthridone). During the experiment available PAC concentrations in pore water (estimated using solid phase microextraction) decreased more than total PAC concentrations in the sediment. Relating effect concentrations to PAC concentrations in pore water and in organisms showed that the two homocyclic compounds caused narcotic effects during chronic exposure, but only one of the four tested heterocyclic PACs caused narcotic effects. The transformation product phenanthridone was not toxic at the tested concentrations (up to 4000 μmol/kg dry sediment), whereas EC 50 values for the parent compound phenanthridine and the isomer acridone were below the estimated limit for narcosis, suggesting a specific mode of action. These results demonstrated the unpredictable (isomer) specific toxicity of azaarenes and their transformation products, emphasizing the need of chronic toxicity testing to gain insight into the long-term effects of heterocyclic PACs, which have been overlooked in risk assessment. © 2008 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|Arsenic (As) is a metalloid, {{naturally}} {{associated with}} gold, sulphur, iron and heavy metals {{and is often}} found in soils and wastes around former mines and industrial sites because of the processing of As-bare minerals. Assessment of the bioavailability of As in these soils {{is very important in}} order to protect human and ecosystems health. Earthworms are often used to assess the bioavailability of As in soils (Langdon et al., 2003). In this work, Eisenia andrei was exposed to As-polluted soils from Valle Anzasca and Scarlino (Italy) in order to evaluate the bioavailability of As. Different X-ray based techniques were used to evaluate the concentration and the distribution of As both in soils and earthworms. For this study, three soil samples per polluted site were collected, sieved (2 mm) and dried. The mineralogical characterization of the soils was carried out by X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD). The total As was estimated on site via portable X-ray fluorescence (XRF), while sequential extractions (Wenzel et al., 2001) coupled with total reflection XRF (TXRF) were used to study the mobility of As. Soil elemental maps were acquired using micro XRF (µXRF) in order to evaluate the As distribution and its correlation with other elements. All the above analyses were conducted also on two control soils. For the assessment of the bioavailability, ten sexually mature earthworms were exposed to each contaminated soil and controls. The mortality was assessed after 14 days of exposure (acute toxicity). Oxidative stress was estimated by mesauring H 2 O 2, catalase, phenoloxidase, glutathione S-transferase and malondialdehyde. The effect of As on the <b>reproduction</b> (chronic <b>toxicity),</b> was assessed after 28 days of exposure. Earthworms were embedded in epoxidic resin and thin sections (100 μm thickness) were analyzed via μXRF in order to localize As accumulation. Since detoxification mechanisms seem to act mainly inside the coelom (e. g. for Cd, Panzarino et al., 2016), coelomic fluids (few µl) were electrically extruded from worms and analysed by TXRF in order to quantify the As concentration [...] . ...|$|R

40|$|The effect {{assessments}} of pesticides on non-target organisms mainly rely on toxicity tests using surrogate species which deliver endpoints regarding the survival, growth and reproduction of test individuals. For aquatic vertebrates (represented by fish) specific protection goals address {{the survival of}} individuals and the abundance and biomass of populations. Since individual-level endpoints can easily be measured and are cost-effective, and since testing on field populations is neither ethical nor practical for vertebrates, results of fish toxicity tests should be extrapolated to the population level, at least the measured effects on individual growth and/or reproduction. Ecologically relevant extrapolations can be achieved using population modelling of representatives of vulnerable fish species in the field, focal species, which are not only characterized by their intrinsic sensitivity to stress but also by their susceptibility to pesticide exposure and their population resilience. The conducted research comprehensively identified focal fish species {{for each of the}} following types of pesticide effects: juvenile survival, adult survival and reproduction. The susceptibility of fish species to pesticide exposure and their population resilience in case adversely affected were considered for the identification, following a step-wise filtering and matrix modelling approach. Then, an individual-based population model was built for the minnow, the identified focal species for pesticide effects on reproduction i. e. for adverse effects on fecundity, fertility, hatching or larval survival. This model can serve as a non-experimental refinement option whereby it {{can be used as a}} virtual laboratory for the assessment of measured effects on <b>reproduction</b> in standard <b>toxicity</b> tests, on the population level of an ecologically relevant fish species. The modelling process was documented following good modelling practice and the applicability of this model to ERA was generically demonstrated.

In {{order to reduce the}} imbalance of existing data {{and to be able to}} proceed with profound and comprehensive risk analyses and evaluation procedures for the environmental compartments soil, water and sediment a successive and comprehensive approach is being developed in this project. The main emphasis is laid on seven organic chemicals and one metal compound (cadmiumchloride) which persist and bioaccumulate. 4, 4 -DDT, benzo-[a]-pyrene, pentachlorophenol, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, trinitrotoluene were selected to cover a relatively wide range of lipophilicity. 3, 4 -dichloroaniline was selected for its covalent binding characteristics to organic matter. Tributyltin was chosen as an organometallic compound and due to the high acutal environmental relevance. Because of missing soil and sediment toxicity data for these chemicals gaps are being filled experimentally. Sediment <b>toxicity</b> <b>reproduction</b> tests are being conducted using Vallisneria americana, Hyalella azteca, Chironomus riparius, and Lumbriculus variegatus. Three spiked soils are being tested for their <b>toxicity</b> on <b>reproduction</b> of Eisenia fetida, Folsomia candida. Effect parameters for microorganisms within soils are respiration and nitrification. For the plants Avena sativa and Brassica rapa growth and germination are determined. First results in soil toxicity testing for 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, pentachlorophenol and tributyltin are prestented on this poster. Because of missing aquatoxicity data for the sediment organisms, aquatic toxicity tests (exposition via water) are necessary. First results for 2, 4 dichlorophenol, pentachlorophenol, cadmiumchloride, 2, 4, 6 -trinitrotoluole and 3, 4 -dichloroaniline are presented on this poster.

Sie sind zum Teil in großen Mengen in unserer Umwelt zu finden und können die Entwicklung von Menschen und Tieren beeinträchtigen. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurden Assays entwickelt, mit denen mehrere endokrine Substanzen im Wasser simultan mit einem Fluoreszenzbiosensor gemessen werden können. Hierzu wurden kreuzreaktive Antikörper und neuronale Netze für die Datenauswertung verwendet. Die Automatisierung und die Feldtauglichkeit des Sensors standen dabei im Vordergrund. Für den Aufbau des Assaysystems wurden polyklonale Antikörper mit der Reflektometrischen Interferenz-Spektroskopie im Hinblick auf Affinitätskonstante, Kinetik und Kreuzreaktivität charakterisiert. Es wurde ein Modell zur Beschreibung des Einflusses eines Kreuzreagenz auf die Kalibrierung eines Analyten entwickelt. Mit den erhaltenen Daten wurden Einzelkalibrierungen für Estron, Estradiol, Ethinylestradiol und Bisphenol A mit einem Biosensor beruhend auf dem „total {{internal}} reflectance fluorescence“ (TIRF) -Prinzip durchgeführt und hinsichtlich der Nachweisgrenze und Stabilität der biologischen Komponenten optimiert. Anschließend wurden binäre und ternäre Assaysysteme auf dem TIRF-Sensor entwickelt. Die Datenanalyse erfolgte mit neuronalen Netzen. Verschiedene Analyte wurden kalibriert, und eine Optimierung bezüglich der Nachweisgrenze, des Versuchsplans und des Netzdesigns, sowie die Mengen der Antikörper durchgeführt. Alle Nachweisgrenzen erreichten den sub-ppb-Bereich. Zuletzt wurde noch ein Assaysystem für den Analyten Microcystin aus Blaualgen mit dem TIRF-Sensor entwickelt. Mit diesem System soll eine Online-Überwachung von Oberflächengewässern ermöglicht werden, um letztlich ein Frühwarnsystem zu erhalten, das in kürzester Zeit (< 1 h) Informationen über mögliche Kontaminationen sammelt und diese an öffentliche Stellen weiterleitet. Endocrine disrupting compounds, especially chemicals with estrogenic activity, {{have drawn}} increasing attention {{in recent years}} because of their eventual effects on human and wildlife development and <b>reproduction.</b> Regarding the <b>toxicity</b> of these substances the contamination state of the environment, especially surface waters, is not reached. Unfortunately the critical concentration for the estrogenic effect is extremely low. Therefore a monitoring of waste water is necessary. An immunosensor for fast and direct monitoring of surface water is presented. The multi-analyte application of this sensor uses a data acquisition called neural networks. The first aspect of this work was the characterisation of the polyclonal antibodies with the reflectometric interference spectroscopy with regard to affinity constants, kinetics and cross-reactivity. Within these studies a mathematical model was developed for {{the description of the}} influence which a cross-reactant shows in the calibration of a standard analyte. With these information single-analyte calibration for estrone, estradiol, ethinylestradiol, bisphenol A, atrazine and simazine were developed on the total internal reflectance fluorescence (TIRF) - sensor and optimised in terms of limit of detection and stability of the biological compounds. Afterwards these analytes were used to develop a multi-analyte assay with cross-reactive antibodies and neural networks for data acquisition. The binary and ternary calibrations were optimised with respect to limit of detection, experimental design, and neural net design. The calibrations were validated with real samples. All limits of detection are in the sub ppb-range. Besides these cross-reactivity assays an assay for microcystin, a toxin of cyano bacteria, was developed.

A research report on the relevance of endocrine substances and pharmaceuticals in aquatic environments (Moltmann et al. 2007) showed that endocrine end-points of in-vivo tests (31 of 71 tested substances) tend to be more sensitive than general ecotoxicological end-points, such as mortality and growth.

Vapor or high levels of dust inhalation and dermal exposure to biphenyl can cause eye inflammation, irritation of respiratory organs, and permanent lesions in the liver and nervous system. In this study, the workplace environment concentrations were assessed as central tendency exposure and reasonable maximum exposure and were shown to be 0. 03 and 0. 12 mg/m 3, respectively. In addition, the carcinogenic risk of biphenyl as determined by risk assessment was 0. 14 × 10 − 4 (central tendency exposure) and 0. 56 × 10 − 4 (reasonable maximum exposure), which is below the acceptable risk value of 1. 0 × 10 − 4. Furthermore, the central tendency exposure and reasonable maximum exposure hazard quotients were 0. 01 and 0. 06 for oral toxicity, 0. 05 and 0. 23 for inhalation toxicity, and 0. 08 and 0. 39 for <b>reproduction</b> <b>toxicity,</b> respectively, which are all lower than the acceptable hazard quotient of 1. 0. Therefore, exposure to biphenyl {{was found to be}} safe in current workplace environments. Because occupational exposure limits are based on socioeconomic assessment, they are generally higher than tru...|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of {{experiments}} the toxicity of lead to worms in soil was determined following the draft OECD earthworm <b>reproduction</b> <b>toxicity</b> protocol except that lead was added as solid lead nitrate, carbonate and sulphide rather than as lead nitrate solution as would normally be the case. The compounds {{were added to the}} test soil to give lead concentrations of 625 - 12500 pg Pb g- 1 of soil. Calculated toxicities of the lead decreased in the order nitrate > carbonate > sulphide, the same order as the decrease in the solubility of the metal compounds used. The 7 -day LC 50 (lethal concentration when 50 % of the population is killed) for the nitrate was 5321 +/- 275 mug Pb g(- 1) of soil and this did not change with time. The LC 50 values for carbonate and sulphide could not be determined at the concentration ranges used. The only parameter sensitive enough to distinguish the toxicities of the three compounds was cocoon (egg) production. The EC 50 S for cocoon production (the concentration to produce a 50 % reduction in cocoon production) were 993, 8604 and 10 246 mug Pb g(- 1) of soil for lead nitrate, carbonate and sulphide, respectively. Standard toxicity tests need {{to take into account the}} form in which the contaminant is present in the soil to be of environmental relevance. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{bioavailability}} and toxicity of lead nitrate and lead chloride to Enchytraeus crypticus in a natural standard soil. Worms were exposed to Pb-spiked soil for 21 d, and survival and reproduction were related to total, 0. 01 M CaCl 2 -extractable, and porewater Pb concentrations in the soil and internal concentrations in the surviving animals. The Pb availability for Pb(NO 3) 2 and PbCl 2 was similar, as confirmed by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The Pb concentrations in surviving worms increased with increasing Pb concentrations in the soil and did not differ for the 2 Pb salts. Lead was toxic to E. crypticus at median lethal concentrations (LC 50 s) of 543 and 779 mg Pb/kg dry soil and median effect concentrations (EC 50 s) of 189 and 134 mg Pb/kg dry soil, for Pb(NO 3) 2 and PbCl 2, respectively. Mortality of E. crypticus was related to internal Pb concentrations in the worms rather than to total or available Pb concentrations in the soil, whereas <b>reproduction</b> <b>toxicity</b> was better explained from Pb concentrations in 0. 01 M CaCl 2 extracts or porewater of the test soil than from total Pb concentrations in the soil or Pb concentrations in the worms. Overall, the bioavailability and toxicity of Pb(NO 3) 2 and PbCl 2 to E. crypticus in LUFA 2. 2 soil did not differ. Environ Toxicol Chem 2017; 36 : 2083 – 2091...|$|E
