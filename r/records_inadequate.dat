40|$|Regulatory {{inspections}} {{are important}} to evaluate {{the integrity of the}} data submitted to health authorities (HAs), protect patient safety, and assess adequacy of site/sponsor quality systems to achieve the same. Inspections generally occur after submission of data for marketing approval of an investigational drug. In recent years, there has been a significant increase in number of inspections by different HAs, including in India. The assessors/inspectors generally do a thorough review of site data before inspections. All aspects of ICH-GCP, site infrastructure, and quality control systems are assessed during the inspection. Findings are discussed during the close out meeting and a detailed inspection report issued afterward, which has to be responded to within 15 - 30 days with effective Corrective and Preventive Action Plan (CAPA). Protocol noncompliance, inadequate/inaccurate <b>records,</b> <b>inadequate</b> drug accountability, informed consent issues, and adverse event reporting were some of the most common findings observed during recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) inspections. Drug development is being increasingly globalized and an increased number of patients enrolled in studies submitted as part of applications {{come from all over the}} world including India. Because of the steep increase in research activity in the country, inexperienced sites, and more stakeholders, increased efforts will be required to ensure continuous quality and compliance.

The goal of the research is to provide South African policy makers, programme administrators and development practitioners with information to make sound policy and programme decisions for the reduction of such constraints. The research also aims to make potential entrepreneurs {{aware of the importance}} of considering capital constraints to the start-up and growth of their businesses. This research was informed by the principles of qualitative research and is both exploratory and interpretative in nature. The research process comprised of two phases. The first phase constituted a sample of five experts from the finance-enabling environment (financial institutions); and the second phase was made up of twenty start-up entrepreneurs in the emerging agribusiness industry. The research found that barriers to accessing finance are largely due to lack of collateral, a poor credit <b>record,</b> <b>inadequate</b> business skills and communication problems between financiers and entrepreneurs. On the issue of what role the finance-enabling environment should play in reducing barriers to finance, findings from the research suggested more risk-taking by the financiers, relaxing the stringent credit assessment criteria, increasing the risk appetite and providing more for impairments or bad debts.

40|$|Objectives To {{study the}} extent and {{execution}} of redundant processes during inpatient transfers to Radiology, {{and their impact on}} errors during the transfer process; to explore the use of causal and reliability analyses for modelling error detection and redundancy in the transfer process; and to provide guidance on potential system improvements. Methods A prospective observational study at a metropolitan teaching hospital. 101 patient transfers to Radiology were observed over a 6 -month period, and errors in patient transfer process were recorded. Fault Tree Analysis was used to model error paths and identify redundant steps. Reliability Analysis was used to quantify system reliability. Results 420 errors were noted, an average of four errors per transfer. No incidents of patient harm were <b>recorded.</b> <b>Inadequate</b> handover was the most common error (43. 1 %), followed by failure to perform patient identification checks (41. 9 %), patient inadequately prepared for transfer (7. 4 %), inadequate infection control precautions (2. 9 %), inadequate clinical escort (2. 1 %), inadequate transport vehicle (2. 1 %) and equipment failure (0. 2 %). Four redundant steps for communicating patients' infectious status were identified (reliability= 0. 07, 0. 37, 0. 26, 0. 31). Collectively, these yielded a system reliability of 0. 7. The low reliability of each individual step was due to its low rate of execution. Conclusions Analysis of the transfer process revealed a number of redundancies that safeguard against transfer errors. However, they were relatively ineffective in preventing errors, due to the poor compliance rate. Thus, the authors advocate increasing compliance to existing redundant processes as an improvement strategy, before investing resources on new processes. 7 page(s...|$|R
