We show how graph partitioning {{can be used}} to increase the speed of <b>planning</b> optimum <b>routes.</b> Creating a graph partition with future <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> in mind leads to a non-standard graph partitioning problem. In particular, the quality of a partition, indicated by the objective value, is assumed to represent the execution time of the <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> process. We present an efficient approximation algorithm for creating graph partitions suited for fast optimum <b>route</b> <b>planning.</b> We study the relation between the objective value and the number of edges evaluated by the <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> algorithm, which is an objective measure of the <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> speed. Experiments show that the best partition according to the objective value does not lead to the fastest <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> process.

Finally, algorithms of great ellipse <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> are studied, especially equal distance <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> algorithm based on Newton-Raphson(N-R) method. Comparative examples show that the difference of <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> between great circle and great ellipse is significant, using algorithms of great ellipse <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> can eliminate the navigation error caused by the great circle <b>route</b> <b>planning,</b> and effectively improve the accuracy of navigation calculation...|$|R

40|$|One way {{to prevent}} {{collisions}} and deadlocks between agents on infrastructures with capacity constraints is to use context-aware <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> algorithms. In context-aware <b>route</b> <b>planning,</b> there {{is a set of}} agents each <b>planning</b> a conflict-free <b>route</b> from a start location to a destination location on a common infrastructure. If a sequential approach is used for <b>route</b> <b>planning,</b> finding an optimal conflict-free route for a single agent can be done in polynomial time by allowing agents to place reservations on infrastructure resources for the intended periods of occupation. In the multi-stage variant of the context-aware <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> problem, there is a sequence of locations to be visited by an agent instead of just a start and destination location as in single-stage <b>route</b> <b>planning.</b> A straightforward approach to the multi-stage <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> problem would be concatenating subsequent routes found by a single-stage algorithm. However, this solution is incomplete and sub-optimal in case of context-aware <b>route</b> <b>planning.</b> Therefore, we developed three multi-stage <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> algorithms that always return an optimal route for a single agent, given a set of reservations made by previous agents. The results of our experiments show that one of the multi-stage algorithms is suitable for use in practice, since the cpu-time needed to make a route is at most a few tenths of a second.

40|$|<b>Route</b> <b>planning</b> {{is a key}} {{technology}} for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to fly reliably and safely {{in the presence of}} a threat environment. Existing <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> methods are mainly based on the simulation scene, whereas approaches based on the virtual globe platform have rarely been reported. In this paper, a new planning space for the virtual globe and the planner is proposed and a common threat model is constructed for threats including a no-fly zone, hazardous weather, radar coverage area, missile killing zone and dynamic threats. Additionally, an improved ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm is developed to enhance <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> efficiency and terrain masking ability. Our <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> methods are optimized on the virtual globe platform for practicability. A <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> system and six types of planners were developed and implemented on the virtual globe platform.

During navigation such regional information could be used to overcome missing or imprecise spatial information on the detailed level. Experiments 2 and 3 studied the use and interaction of <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> strategies that are applied after an environment has been learned.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Route</b> <b>planning,</b> {{which is}} used to {{calculate}} feasible routes in a given environment, {{is one of the key}} issues in navigation systems. According to different constraints in different given space, various <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> strategies have been developed in recent years. Current <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> models for indoor space focus on providing routes for pedestrians or fix-sized users, like robots and persons in wheelchairs. None of the existing model can provide feasible routes for arbitrary-shape users, which appears to be more and more useful in many situations, like users driving small indoor autos or moving carts with products. This paper proposes a two-phase <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> model which can support <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> for users with arbitrary shapes. In the first phase, the LEGO model represents the entire space by using different types of cubes. These cubes are further merged in the second phase to form the maximum accessible blocks. By computing the maximum accessible widths and lengths between blocks, a LEGO graph is built to perform route searching algorithms. ...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the number}} of targets, <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> can be a very complex task. Human navigators, however, usually solve <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> tasks fastly and efficiently. Here two {{experiments}} are presented that studied human <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> performance, <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> strategies employed, and cognitive processes involved. For this, 25 places were arranged on a regular grid in a large room. Each place was marked by a unique symbol. Subjects were repeatedly asked to solve traveling salesman problems (TSP), i. e. to find the shortest closed loop connecting a given start place with a number of target places. For this, subjects were given a so-called 2 ̆ 7 shopping list 2 ̆ 7 depicting the symbols of the start place and the target places. While the TSP is computationally hard, sufficient solutions can be found by simple strategies such as the nearest neighbor strategy. In Experiment 1, it was tested whether humans deployed the nearest neighbor strategy (NNS) when solving the TSP. Results showed that subjects outperformed the NNS in cases in which the NNS did not predict the optimal solution, suggesting that the NNS is not sufficient to explain human <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> behavior. As a second possible strategy a region-based approach was tested in Experiment 2. When optimal routes required more region transitions than other, sub-optimal routes, subjects preferred these sub-optimal routes. This result suggests that subjects first <b>planned</b> a coarse <b>route</b> on the region level and then refined the route during navigation. Such a hierarchical planning stragey would allow to reduce computational effort during <b>route</b> <b>planning.</b> In a control condition, the target places were directly marked in the environment rather than being depicted on the shopping list. As subjects did not have to identify and remember the positions of the target places based on the shopping list during <b>route</b> <b>planning,</b> this control condition tested for the influence of spatial working memory for <b>route</b> <b>planning</b> performance. Results showed a strong performance increase in the control condition, emphasizing the prominent role of spatial working memory for <b>route</b> <b>planning...</b>|$|R
