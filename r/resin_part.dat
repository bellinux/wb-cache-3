2500|$|Some methods melt or {{soften the}} {{material}} to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Laser sintering techniques include selective laser sintering, with both metals and polymers, and direct metal laser sintering. Selective laser melting does not use sintering for the fusion of powder granules but will completely melt the powder using a high-energy laser to create fully dense materials in a layer-wise method that has mechanical properties {{similar to those of}} conventional manufactured metals. Electron beam melting is a similar type of additive manufacturing technology for metal parts (e.g. titanium alloys). EBM manufactures parts by melting metal powder layer by layer with an electron beam in a high vacuum. Another method consists of an inkjet 3D printing system, which creates the model one layer at a time by spreading a layer of powder (plaster, or resins) and printing a binder in the cross-section of the part using an inkjet-like process. With laminated object manufacturing, thin layers are cut to shape and joined together. [...] Other methods cure liquid materials using different sophisticated technologies, such as stereolithography. Photopolymerization is primarily used in stereolithography to produce a solid part from a liquid. Inkjet printer systems like the Objet PolyJet system spray photopolymer materials onto a build tray in ultra-thin layers (between 16 and 30µm) until the part is completed. Each photopolymer layer is cured with UV light after it is jetted, producing fully cured models that can be handled and used immediately, without post-curing. Ultra-small features can be made with the 3D micro-fabrication technique used in multiphoton photopolymerisation. Due to the nonlinear nature of photo excitation, the gel is cured to a solid only in the places where the laser was focused while the remaining gel is then washed away. Feature sizes of under 100nm are easily produced, as well as complex structures with moving and interlocked parts. Yet another approach uses a synthetic resin that is solidified using LEDs. In Mask-image-projection-based stereolithography, a 3D digital model is sliced by a set of horizontal planes. Each slice is converted into a two-dimensional mask image. The mask image is then projected onto a photocurable liquid resin surface and light is projected onto the resin to cure it {{in the shape of the}} layer. Continuous liquid interface production begins with a pool of liquid photopolymer <b>resin.</b> <b>Part</b> of the pool bottom is transparent to ultraviolet light (the [...] "window"), which causes the resin to solidify. The object rises slowly enough to allow resin to flow under and maintain contact with the bottom of the object. [...] In powder-fed directed-energy deposition, a high-power laser is used to melt metal powder supplied to the focus of the laser beam. The powder fed directed energy process is similar to Selective Laser Sintering, but the metal powder is applied only where material is being added to the part at that moment.|$|E

40|$|Three {{improvements}} {{have been}} devised for the cold-box process, which is a special molding process used to make sand/binder cores for casting hollow metal parts. These improvements are: The use of fiber-reinforced composite binder materials (in contradistinction to the non-fiber-reinforced binders used heretofore), The substitution of a directed-vortex core-blowing subprocess for a prior core-blowing process that involved a movable gassing plate, and The use of filters made from filtration-grade fabrics to prevent clogging of vents. For reasons that exceed {{the scope of this}} article, most foundries have adopted the cold-box process for making cores for casting metals. However, this process is not widely known outside the metal-casting industry; therefore, a description of pertinent aspects of the cold-box process is prerequisite to a meaningful description of the aforementioned improvements. In the cold-box process as practiced heretofore, sand is first mixed with a phenolic resin (considered to be part 1 of a three-part binder) and an isocyanate <b>resin</b> (<b>part</b> 2 of the binder). Then by use of compressed air, the mixture is blown into a core box, which is a mold for forming the core. Next, an amine gas (part 3 of the binder) that acts as a catalyst for polymerization of parts 1 and 2 is blown through the core box. Alternatively, a liquid amine that vaporizes during polymerization can be incorporated into the sand/resin mixture. Once polymerization is complete, the amine gas is purged from the core box by use of compressed air. The finished core is then removed from the core box...|$|E

The part physical characteristics are surface finish, dimensional accuracy and distortion where as mechanical characteristics are flexural property, ultimate tensile strength and impact strength. Thus paper proposes to study the influence of the layer thickness (build parameters) over the part quality. The study is conducted on the test samples of SL 5530, which were built on SLA 5000 machine, under different sets of process parameters and tested under ASTM specified test conditions.

I had a definite interest in the challenge of marrying two very different materials; clay and resin, and by using this combination I would make vessels that were visually successful and engaged the viewer.

From an expressive standpoint, I feel the form of the vessels is viewed as solid and confrontational, yet very compelling. The smooth surfaces and the lush vibrant colors compel the viewer to examine the forms. The pieces are commanding in size and strength, so the viewer is somewhat hesitant to view for too long.

40|$|Mica/Epoxy machine {{insulation}} is {{a composite}} material of the mineral mica, fibre-glass mesh and epoxy resin. The material is used in motors and generators rated for high voltage, where the material must withstand multiple stresses such as elevated temperatures, mechanical and electrical stresses. This is a novel investigation {{that focuses on the}} breakdown mechanisms related to electrical stress of the insulation. These include partial discharges and electrical treeing. The micro Computed Tomography (μCT) uses a series of X-ray images to visualise the interior. This provides a method for non-invasively examination of the insulation for any signs of material degradation caused by high electrical fields. The following thesis presents an initial study on how this material system interacts with the μCT, the production of 16 samples capable of being electrically aged and scanned in the μCT, with minimal interference, sample preparation and an analysis of the images produced from the μCT. The samples produced are electrically aged at different voltages after which they are scanned with the μCT. The images produced are then analysed for signs of material degradation using different software. Some of the samples did have a complete electrical breakdown and an attempt of correlating these breakdowns to the amount of folds in the insulation is done. It is found that samples with an aluminium core are suitable for μCT imaging. The visualisation of defects such as voids, <b>resin</b> rich <b>parts</b> or folds in insulation is also possible. The detection of material degradation due to electrical aging is not clear enough to draw any conclusions although some possible signs are found. For samples that had an electrical breakdown the result is much clearer. It shows the breakdown channels path inside the insulation, moving in between the mica tape layers. The samples with a complete breakdown also had tendencies that the breakdown channels followed the <b>resin</b> rich <b>part</b> in the sample.
