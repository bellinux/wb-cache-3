It argues that effective computing with Zeno-machines falls into a dilemma: either they are specified such {{that they do not have}} output states, or they are specified such that they do have output states, but involve contradiction. Repairs though noneffective methods or special rules for semi-decidable problems are sought, but not found.

Moreover, MT depolymerization is observed following accumulation of S-RNases in the pollen cytosol. On the other hand, S-RNase was prevented from entering the pollen tube when the pollen was treated with the actin filament (AF) inhibitor latrunculin A (LatA), the MT inhibitor oryzalin, or the MT stabilizer taxol at sub-toxic concentrations.

Introduction [...] Anglo-Japanese relations and World War One [...] Fear of Japan in Australia [...] William Morris Hughes [...] Japan's proposal and diplomacy at Paris [...] <b>Reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>rejection</b> : a discussion [...] Conclusion. Japan as an ally of Britain, since the signing of Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1902, entered World War One at British request. During the Great War Japan fought Germany in Asia and afforded protection to Australia. After {{the conclusion of the}} War, a peace conference was held at Paris in 1919. As a victorious ally and as one of the Five Great Powers of the day, Japan participated at the Paris Peace Conference, and proposed racial equality to be enshrined in the Covenant of the League of Nations. This Racial Equality Bill, despite the tireless efforts of the Japanese delegates who engaged the representatives of other countries in intense diplomatic negotiations, was rejected. The rejection, a debatable issue ever since, has inspired many explanations including the theory that it was a deliberate Japanese ploy to achieve other goals in the agenda. This thesis has researched the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>rejection</b> and contends that the rejection was not due to any one particular reason. Four key factors: a) resolute opposition from Australian Prime Minister Hughes determined to protect White Australia Policy, b) lack of British support, c) lack of US support, and d) lack of support from the British dominions of New Zealand, Canada and South Africa; converged to defeat the Japanese proposal. Japanese inexperience in international diplomacy evident from strategic and tactical mistakes, their weak presentations and communications, and enormous delays in negotiations, at Paris, undermined Japan's position at the conference, but the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>rejection</b> of the racial equality proposal were extrinsic.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{report on}} {{rejected}} choices of specialty as long-term careers and <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>rejection.</b> DESIGN: Postal questionnaire survey. SETTING: United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: All graduates of 1996 and 1999 from UK medical schools {{during their first}} year after qualification. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Any career choice which had been seriously considered and rejected and the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> its <b>rejection.</b> RESULTS: In all, 33. 1 % (1871) of respondents named a rejected choice and gave <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> its <b>rejection.</b> Disproportionately high numbers rejected the surgical specialties, paediatrics and obstetrics and gynaecology (OandG), using the specialty distribution of positive choices as the comparator. Relatively few doctors rejected general practice (GP) after giving it serious consideration. Doctors rejecting the hospital medical and surgical specialties or paediatrics {{were most likely to}} specify reasons relating to quality of life. Three-quarters of the graduates of 1999 who rejected OandG did so because of poor career prospects. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life issues, and concerns about working relationships, are sufficiently influential to persuade many doctors to abandon an initial choice of medical career. It is unlikely that much of the decline in entry to GP is attributable to rejection of GP by doctors who initially chose it. The decline must therefore represent {{an increase in the number}} of doctors who had never seriously considered it as a long-term career choice...|$|R
