Two of the FG-1D Corsairs ceased their pursuit at 36000 ft, but Marine Captain Kenneth Reusser and his wingman Klingman continued to 38000 ft, expending most of their [...]50 caliber ammunition to lighten their aircraft. Reusser scored hits on the [...] "Nick's" [...] port engine, but ran out of ammunition, and was under fire from the Japanese rear gunner.

40|$|In the paper, we {{introduce}} some stabilizers {{and investigate}} related properties {{of them in}} MTL-algebras. Then, we also characterize some special classes of MTL-algebras, for example, IMTL-algebras, integral MTL-algebras, Gödel algebras and MV-algebras, in terms of these stabilizers. Moreover, we discuss the relation between stabilizers and several special filters (ideals) in MTL-algebras. Finally, we discuss the relation between these stabilizers and prove that the <b>right</b> implicative <b>stabilizer</b> and <b>right</b> multiplicative <b>stabilizer</b> are order isomorphic.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{investigate}} very true MTL-algebras and prove the completeness of the very true MTL-logic. In this paper, the concept of very true operators on MTL-algebras is introduced and some related properties are investigated. Also, conditions for an MTL-algebra to be an MV-algebra and a Gödel algebra are given via this operator. Moreover, very true filters on very true MTL-algebras are studied. In particular, subdirectly irreducible very true MTL-algebras are characterized and an analogous of representation theorem for very true MTL-algebras is proved. Then, the left and <b>right</b> <b>stabilizers</b> of very true MTL-algebras are introduced and some related properties are given. As applications of stabilizer of very true MTL-algebras, we produce a basis for a topology on very true MTL-algebras and show that the generated topology by this basis is Baire, connected, locally connected and separable. Finally, the corresponding logic very true MTL-logic is constructed and the soundness and completeness of this logic are proved based on very true MTL-algebras...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} every finite semigroup is a {{quotient}} of a finite semigroup {{in which every}} <b>right</b> <b>stabilizer</b> satisfies the identities x = x^ 2 and xy = xyx. This result has several consequences. We first give a geometrical application : every finite transformation semigroup has a fixpoint-free covering (a transformation semigroup is fixpoint-free if every element which stabilizes a point is idempotent). Next we use our result and a result of I. Simon on congruences on paths to obtain a purely algebraic proof of a deep theorem of McNaughton on infinite words. Finally, we give an algebraic proof of a theorem of Brown on a finiteness condition for semigroups...|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{determined that}} a spar on the front left of the wing separated, quickly followed by the lower rear spar and the connections which attached the outer wing to the center section. The loss of the left wing caused the aircraft to roll left, whereupon the fuselage and the <b>right</b> horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> collided with the separated wing. The initial separation was caused either by a wind gust in excess of operating velocity, or a similar lower-velocity gust after the material had become fatigued.|$|R

50|$|The Boeing 707 320/420 series had an {{enlarged}} horizontal stabiliser (tailplane) assembly compared to earlier 707 aircraft, {{and in the}} redesign the increased loads on the tailplane structure had been taken by replacing some of the aluminium skinning with stainless steel. In addition, the spar attachment fittings had been redesigned, making them both stronger and stiffer. This had the unforeseen effect of changing the way the tailplane structure handled gust loads, the stiffer fittings being {{no longer able to}} help in absorbing and transferring the stresses caused by gusts and other normal aerodynamic loads, the flexure (i.e., the bending loads) of the left and <b>right</b> horizontal <b>stabilizers</b> instead having to be carried by the stabiliser spars entirely by themselves. This led over time to fatigue cracking in the right horizontal stabiliser's rear spar, which, due to the concealed (internal) nature of the tailplane construction, was not noticed by maintenance engineers.|$|R

50|$|In 1998, {{there was}} a report about a second Su-37 (T10M-12) which was {{similarly}} converted before making its first flight on 23 March the same year. But this aircraft, No.712, was never converted to the Su-37 specifications; it was used in Aktubinsk for weapon and radar tests. Later, the No.712 (with the No.703 and all three serial produced planes, bort No. 86, 87, and 88) added to the Russkie Vityazi demo team, repainted. Flight tests and demonstrations at air shows continued until 2000. In 2001, 711 was outfitted with AL-37FU engines and updated fly-by-wire flight control system and avionics. In December 2002, 711 crashed during a ferry flight, effectively bringing an end to the program; the fault was later traced to structurally damaged <b>right</b> horizontal <b>stabilizer,</b> caused by the extensive load during high g post-stall tight turns. The Su-37 did not reach the production stage, although by mid-2000, Sukhoi introduced several modernizations of the Su-27, such as Su-30MKI and second generation Su-35, which feature similar improvements such as improved avionics and radar systems, and thrust vectoring engines.|$|R

5000|$|An earlier {{stabilization}} {{technology was}} gyroscopic stabilization. The World War I transport USS Henderson, completed in 1917, {{was the first}} large ship with gyro <b>stabilizers</b> (<b>right).</b> It had two 25 ton, 9 ft diameter flywheels mounted {{near the center of}} the ship, spun at 1100 RPM by 75 HP AC motors. The gyroscopes' cases were mounted on vertical bearings. When a small sensor gyroscope on the bridge sensed a roll, a servomotor would rotate the gyros about a vertical axis in a direction so their precession would counteract the roll. In tests this system was able to reduce roll to 3 degrees in the roughest seas. The ship Conte di Savoia, which first sailed in November 1932, had three flywheels which were 13 feet in diameter and weighed 108 tons. Gyroscope stabilization was replaced by fin stabilization due to its lower weight and bulk.|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{repair of}} pectus excavatum by {{minimally}} invasive surgery (Nuss procedure) is well established among pediatric surgeons. Studies on adult patients are rare. We analyzed the efficacy of minimally invasive pectus repair {{in a series of}} adult patients. MethodsWe prospectively included all adult patients with minimally invasive repair of funnel chest treated from 2000 to 2005. The pectus bar was inserted under thoracoscopic control. On the <b>right</b> side a <b>stabilizer</b> was used to prevent bar displacement. Postoperative pain control was provided by epidural catheters. Clinical checks were performed 2 weeks, 3 months, and then annually after discharge. ResultsForty-three adult patients (39 men, 4 women) {{with a mean age of}} 22 years (range 18 - 39 years) were included. Mean duration of the operative procedures was 70 minutes (range 29 - 125 minutes); mean length of hospital stay was 9. 3 days. Bars were removed from 15 patients 3 years after implantation. Minor complications occurred in 8 patients (19 %), with intrapleural effusions being most frequent (n = 5). Three patients (7 %) had major complications: drainage of a pneumothorax (n = 2) and bar displacement (n = 1). The cosmetic results were excellent and patient satisfaction was high. ConclusionsWe conclude that the Nuss procedure was beneficial in adult patients. Dislocation of the pectus bar can be prevented by submuscular placement. The use of corticosteroids may be helpful in case of repeated, uncontaminated pleural effusions. Patient satisfaction and the acceptable number and kind of complications are encouraging...|$|R

Objective: To use tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) to examine VVM skeleton (ie, the most compact whole-brain WM) {{in subjects with}} BD vs healthy control subjects. Design: Cross-sectional, case-control, whole-brain DTI using TBSS. Setting: University research institute. Participants: Fifty-six individuals, 31 having a DSM-IV diagnosis of BD type 1 (mean age, 35. 9 years [age range, 24 - 52 years]) and 25 controls (mean age, 29. 5 years [age range, 19 - 52 years]). Main Outcome Measures: Fractional anisotropy (FA) longitudinal and radial diffusivities in subjects with BD vs controls (covarying for age) and their relationships with clinical and demographic variables. Results: Subjects with BD vs controls had significantly greater FA (t > 3. 0, P 3. 0, P <=. 05 corrected) in the right uncinate fasciculus (greater radial diffusivity). Among subjects with BD, significant negative correlations (P <. 01) were found between age and FA in bilateral uncinate fasciculi and in the right anterothalamic radiation, {{as well as between}} medication load and FA in the left optic radiation. Decreased FA (P <. 01) was observed in the left optic radiation and in the right anterothalamic radiation among subjects with BD taking vs those not taking mood stabilizers, {{as well as in the}} left optic radiation among depressed vs remitted subjects with BD. Subjects having BD with vs without lifetime alcohol or other drug abuse had significantly decreased FA in the left uncinate fasciculus. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to use TBSS to examine WM in subjects with BD.
