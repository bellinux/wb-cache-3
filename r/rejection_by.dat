5|$|The main {{threats to}} the park's {{biodiversity}} are wood extraction and forest clearing for agriculture and pastures. A large issue is the <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> some local inhabitants of the new park boundaries.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Monet's {{innovative}} use {{of light}} and color led to its <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> the Paris Salon of 1869. Today, art historians classify The Magpie as one of Monet's best snowscape paintings. The painting was privately held until the Musée d'Orsay acquired it in 1984; it {{is considered one of}} the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano had {{symptoms}} of syphilis, {{which he had}} caught during his time in Europe. This sickness forced him to take long leaves from {{his work in the}} Consulate, and to suggest his cousin Juan José Castelli, who had similar ideas, as a possible replacement during his leaves. <b>Rejection</b> <b>by</b> the committee members delayed the approval of Castelli until 1796.|$|E

5|$|Following its <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> Coates, the {{painting}} remained in Eakins' possession until his death. It was exhibited just twice more during Eakins' lifetime: at the 1886 Southern Exposition in Louisville, Kentucky, and in 1887 at Chicago's Inter-State Industrial Exposition, and ignored by critics on both occasions. The painting then disappears from the historical record—there is no further reference to {{the painting}} in any records from Eakins or his circle of friends during Eakins' lifetime. Following Eakins' death, the painting was exhibited in Philadelphia and New York at memorial exhibitions in 1917.|$|E
5|$|Her myths emphasise her bad {{temper and}} unhappiness, due to <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> her father Shiva and her husband, and the hatred of her stepmother, Chandi (Shiva's wife, {{identified}} with Parvati in this context). In the Puranas, sage Kashyapa {{is considered to}} be her father, and not Shiva, although Lord Shiva is a father figure to her. Manasa is depicted as kind to her devotees, but harsh to people who refused to worship her. Denied full godhead by her mixed parentage, Manasa's aim was to fully establish her authority as a goddess and to acquire steadfast human devotees.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, {{his first}} book Paris des rues et des chansons was published, after many <b>rejections</b> <b>by</b> other {{prospective}} publishers. With text by Jacques Prévert, Boris Vian, Georges Brassens, Charles Trenet, and Pierre Mac Orlan, {{it came out in}} three editions, and 35,000 copies were sold.|$|R
50|$|Though cytotoxic-crossmatch assay {{can predict}} <b>rejection</b> {{mediated}} <b>by</b> cellular immunity, genetic-expression tests {{specific to the}} organ type to be transplanted, for instance AlloMap Molecular Expression Testing, have a high negative predictive value. Transplanting only ABO-compatible grafts (matching blood groups between donor and recipient) helps prevent <b>rejection</b> mediated <b>by</b> humoral immunity.|$|R
50|$|An {{aspiring}} doctor, Kaplan {{hoped to}} enter medicine, but claimed was rejected from all five New York City area medical schools because ethnic quotas for Jewish students {{had already been}} filled.

5|$|However Honora Sneyd's father {{moved to}} Lichfield from London in 1771, and {{reassembled}} his {{family of five}} daughters there. By now Honora was nineteen and Anna viewed her friend's departure with considerable dismay. Although Day was much distressed by his <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> Honora Sneyd, he transferred his affections to the fifth daughter, Elizabeth Sneyd, {{who had been in}} the care of Mr Henry Powys and his wife, Susannah Sneyd, of the Abbey, Shrewsbury, Mrs. Powys being Mr Sneyd's niece. However Elizabeth Sneyd was not inclined to accept Day.|$|E
5|$|Since devolution, {{in which}} other {{countries}} of the United Kingdom—Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland—each have their own devolved parliament or assemblies for local issues, there has been debate about how to counterbalance this in England. Originally it was planned that various regions of England would be devolved, but following the proposal's <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> the North East in a referendum, {{this has not been}} carried out.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> {{publishers}} of his 1994 manuscript about illegal immigration and epidemics prompted Savage {{to record a}} demo tape with a mock radio talk show about {{the contents of the}} work. He mailed this tape to 250 radio stations in an attempt to change careers and become a radio talk show host. On March 21, 1994, Savage began his radio career on KGO (a San Francisco news/talk radio station) as a fill-in host for the liberal Ray Taliaferro and later as a weekend host.|$|E

By June 2014, Pickles had intervened on 12 windfarm projects and rejected 10 of them, against the recommendations from planning inspectors, rising to 50 <b>rejections</b> <b>by</b> October 2014.|$|R
50|$|Busy {{signals and}} other call <b>rejections</b> <b>by</b> the {{telephone}} network count as call failures. However, the {{inclusion in the}} ASR accounting of some failed calls varies in practical applications. This makes the ASR highly dependent on end-user action. Low answer-seizure ratios {{may be caused by}} far-end switch congestion, not answering by called parties and busy destination circuits.|$|R
50|$|In general, the {{municipal}} parliament, administration or a naturalisation committee decides about naturalisations. However, in some towns, naturalisations {{are subject to}} a popular vote. The Supreme Court decided in 2003 that naturalisations were an administrative act and thus must obey the prohibition of arbitrariness, which rules out <b>rejections</b> <b>by</b> anonymous popular vote without an explanatory statement.|$|R
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{feared that}} they would be assassinated, and taught their {{followers}} that their deaths would be {{similar to those of the}} two witnesses of the Book of Revelation. Balch and Taylor believe that Applewhite's prison experience and early <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> audiences contributed to this fear. Applewhite and Nettles later explained to their followers that the former's treatment by the press was a form of assassination and had fulfilled their prophecy. Applewhite took a materialistic view of the Bible, seeing it as a record of extraterrestrial contact with humanity. He drew heavily from the Book of Revelation, although he avoided traditional theological terminology and took a somewhat negative tone towards Christianity. He only lectured about a small number of verses and never tried to develop a system of theology.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick {{accepted}} that the Americans {{did not need}} British help, but that it could still be useful in bringing the project to an early and successful conclusion. Working closely with {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., he attempted to do everything he could to support the effort. He also endeavoured to place British scientists in as many parts of the project as possible in order to facilitate a post-war British nuclear weapons project to which Chadwick was committed. Requests from Groves via Chadwick for particular scientists tended to be met with an immediate <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> the company, ministry or university currently employing them, only to be overcome by the overriding priority accorded to Tube Alloys. As a result, the British team was critical to the Project's success.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before its}} {{departure}} from India the 5th Light Infantry suffered from weak senior leadership and discord among its British officers (see details of Court of Inquiry report below). To compound the problem, the sepoys themselves {{were divided into}} two major cliques. One led by the Subedar Major Khan Mohamed Khan and Subedar Wahid Ali and the other consisting of Subedar Dunde Khan, Jemedars Chisti Khan and Abdul Ali Khan. According to the Court of Inquiry, {{as a result of these}} two factions, discipline was compromised and any side for any particular policy or measure in the regiment was at once the signal for its <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> the other.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{situations}} in which buyers have a significant stake in what a firm learns about their demands. Specifically, any time that price discrimination is possible on an individual bases and repeat purchases are likely, buyers possess incentives for strategic manipulation of demand information. A simple two-period model in which a monopolist endeavors {{to learn about the}} demand parameter of a repeat buyer is presented here. It is shown that high first-period prices may lead to strategic <b>rejections</b> <b>by</b> high-valuation buyers who wish to conceal information (i. e., to pool), while low first-period prices may lead to strategic <b>rejections</b> <b>by</b> low-valuation buyers who wish to reveal information (i. e., to signal). The seller never experiments against patient buyers in any equilibrium. Indeed, the seller often charges first-period prices that reveal no information at all, and she may even set an equilibrium first-period price strictly below the buyer’s lowest possible valuation...|$|R

After <b>rejections</b> <b>by</b> more than twenty publishers it was finally accepted in 1977 by Quest Books, and he spent a year giving lectures and workshops before going back to writing. He also helped to launch the journal ReVision in 1978.|$|R
5|$|Rajyam and Rao {{approached}} N. T. Rama Rao to play Arjuna {{role in the}} film. Rama Rao {{was happy}} to play Arjuna, but was hesitant to take up Brihannala part; he felt that even a slight misstep would result in <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> the audience. Rajyam assured that Sarma's sketches would help Rama Rao look authentic. Sarma designed the look based on eunuch's statues in major temples and opted for Keralite hairstyles. Bengali makeup artist Haripada Chandra was signed to work on Rama Rao's work. After getting approval from his mentor Kadiri Venkata Reddy on Brihannala's look, Rama Rao agreed {{to be a part}} of the film's cast.|$|E
5|$|The {{first and}} second acts deal with the {{attempts}} of the central character, Harry Luckless, to woo his landlady's daughter, and his efforts to make money by writing plays. In the second act, he finishes a puppet theatre play titled The Pleasures of the Town, about the Goddess Nonsense's choice of a husband from allegorical representatives of theatre and other literary genres. After its <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> one theatre, Luckless's play is staged at another. The third act becomes a play within a play, in which {{the characters in the}} puppet play are portrayed by humans. The Author's Farce ends with a merging of the play's and the puppet show's realities.|$|E
5|$|Barton pursued {{his dreams}} of {{becoming}} a professional footballer by joining Everton's youth system, but played for Liverpool when he was 14. He underwent trials at Nottingham Forest, but was rejected when it was decided he {{was too small to}} become a footballer. Barton said his <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> clubs only made him more determined to succeed as a footballer and prove his detractors wrong. He made his first appearance for Manchester City's under-17s team in 1999 and played regularly at Academy level for three years. His first reserve team appearance came {{at the end of the}} 2000–01 season, in his final year as a trainee. Uncertain about Barton's future prospects, the club planned to release him, but reconsidered and gave him his first professional contract in the close season. Over the next two years, he successfully made the transition from the under-19s to regular reserve football. He was promoted to the first-team squad in the 2002–03 season.|$|E

5|$|Bernhard Mahler {{supported}} his son's ambitions for a music career, and {{agreed that the}} boy should try for {{a place at the}} Vienna Conservatory. The young Mahler was auditioned by the renowned pianist Julius Epstein, and accepted for 1875–76. He made good progress in his piano studies with Epstein and won prizes {{at the end of each}} of his first two years. For his final year, 1877–78, he concentrated on composition and harmony under Robert Fuchs and Franz Krenn. Few of Mahler's student compositions have survived; most were abandoned when he became dissatisfied with them. He destroyed a symphonic movement prepared for an end-of-term competition, after its scornful <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> the autocratic director Joseph Hellmesberger on the grounds of copying errors. Mahler may have gained his first conducting experience with the Conservatory's student orchestra, in rehearsals and performances, although it appears that his main role in this orchestra was as a percussionist.|$|E
5|$|Between his {{election}} and his inauguration, Garfield was occupied with assembling a cabinet that would establish peace between Conkling's and Blaine's warring factions. Blaine's delegates had provided {{much of the}} support for Garfield's nomination, and the Maine senator received the place of honor: Secretary of State. Blaine {{was not only the}} president's closest advisor, he was obsessed with knowing all {{that took place in the}} White House, and was even said to have spies posted there in his absence. Garfield nominated William Windom of Minnesota as Secretary of the Treasury, William H. Hunt of Louisiana as Secretary of the Navy, Robert Todd Lincoln as Secretary of War, and Samuel J. Kirkwood of Iowa as Secretary of the Interior. New York was represented by Thomas Lemuel James as Postmaster General. Garfield appointed Pennsylvania's Wayne MacVeagh, an adversary of Blaine's, as Attorney General. Blaine tried to sabotage the appointment by convincing Garfield to name an opponent of MacVeagh, William E. Chandler, as Solicitor General under MacVeagh. Only Chandler's <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> the Senate forestalled MacVeagh's resignation over the matter.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{incident}} that closed his railroad, Walt Disney consulted with Roger Broggie about the concept of including his ridable miniature train in a potential tour of Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, north of Downtown Los Angeles. Broggie, believing {{that there would be}} limited visitor capacity for the attraction, recommended to Disney that he make the train bigger in scale. The idea of a studio tour was eventually replaced by the idea of an amusement park named Disneyland {{across the street from the}} studio, and in one of its first design concepts at that proposed location, a miniature steam train ride was included, as well as a larger, narrow-gauge steam railroad attraction. During this time, Disney proposed that the narrow-gauge Crystal Springs & Southwestern Railroad, which the nearby Travel Town Museum in Griffith Park planned to build, be extended to run through Disneyland. Planned construction of the Ventura Freeway across land between the two sites, and <b>rejection</b> <b>by</b> the Burbank City Council of a new amusement park in their city, led Disney to look for a different location to build the park and its narrow-gauge railroad.|$|E

40|$|The {{rejections}} {{of selected}} N-nitrosamines by commonly used high-pressure nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were quantitatively evaluated using a bench-scale cross-flow filtration apparatus. The selected nitrosamines included N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), N-nitrosomethylethylamine (NMEA), N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR), N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), N-nitrosodi-n-propylamine (NDPA), N-nitrosodi-n-butylamine (NDBA) and N-nitrosodiphenylamine (NDPHA). Nitrosamine rejections were evaluated {{under steady state}} at elevated feed concentrations, since NDMA rejections {{were found to be}} consistent with feed concentrations over three orders of magnitude. The steady-state nitrosamine <b>rejections</b> <b>by</b> NF membranes varied significantly, from 9 to 75 %, depending on nitrosamine compounds and tested membranes. For hydrophilic compounds, rejections increased with increasing molecular weight. The nitrosamine <b>rejections</b> <b>by</b> brackish RO membranes reached as high as 97 % for higher molecular weight nitrosamines. However, for low molecular weight nitrosamines such as NDMA, rejections as low as 54 % were observed. This low level of rejections was attributed to diffusive solute transport being more effective than convective transport. Physicochemical properties such as molecular weight and aqueous diffusivity showed reasonable correlations with nitrosamine permeability constants. M. S.
