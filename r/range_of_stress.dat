As the market has grown, there have been increasing opportunities for companies to differentiate their products while still maintaining high manufacturing volumes of each product.

Realizing this opportunity will require the ability to confidently predict long-term performance based on accelerated tests and known weather conditions.

This paper discusses some of the challenges of predicting long-term PV performance, including the wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> that may be encountered, the variability <b>of</b> the <b>stresses</b> from moment to moment, the complexity of some degradation mechanisms, and the dependence of accelerated testing on module geometry.

It remains unclear whether the protective action of Dps against specific stresses derives from its DNAbinding activity, which may exclude destructive agents from the chromosomal region, or its ferroxidase activity, which neutralizes and sequesters potentially damaging chemical species. To resolve this question, we have identified the critical residues of Escherichia coli Dps that bind to DNA and modulate iron oxidation. We uncoupled the biochemical activities of Dps, creating Dps variants and mutant E. coli strains that are defective in either DNA-binding or ferroxidase activity. Quantification of the contribution of each activity {{to the protection of}} DNA integrity and cellular viability revealed that both activities of Dps are required in order to counteract many differing stresses. These findings demonstrate that Dps plays a multipurpose role in stress protection via its dual activities, explaining how Dps can be of vital importance to bacterial viability over a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses.</b> BionanoscienceApplied Science...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The paper {{deals with}} a series of new {{experiments}} and corresponding numerical simulations to be able to study the effect of stress state on damage behav-ior of ductile metals. In this context, a thermodynamically consistent anisotropic continuum damage model is presented.

Different branches of the respective criteria are considered corresponding to various damage and failure mechanisms depending on stress intensity, stress triaxiality and the Lode parameter. Since {{it is not possible to}} propose and to validate stress-state-dependent criteria only based on tests with uniaxially loaded specimens for a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> states, new experiments with two-dimensionally loaded specimens have been developed.

40|$|A failure-mode based anisomorphic {{constant}} life diagram for a unidirectional carbon/epoxy laminate under off-axis fatigue loading at {{room temperature}} M Kawai and N Itoh The off-axis constant fatigue life diagrams for a unidirectional carbon/epoxy laminate in different fiber orientations are identified over the whole <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> ratio. The experimental {{results show that the}} off-axis constant fatigue life diagram plotted in the plane of alternating and mean stresses tends to shrink and incline {{to the left of the}} alternating stress axis more significantly as the off-axis angle of a specimen increases. The overall shapes of the off-axis constant fatigue life envelopes for different constant values of life are highly non-linear and asymmetric about the alternating stress axis, regardless of fiber orientation. These observations suggest that the sensitivity to mean stress in off-axis fatigue differs depending on the mode of fatigue loading, i. e. tension–tension, tension–compression, and compression–com-pression loading, and the difference is associated with the different modes of failure under different modes of fatigue loading. To deal with the off-axis fatigue strength of a unidirectional composite for any fiber orientation over the whole <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> ratio, a most general form of the anisomorphic constant fatigue life diagram is developed that can take into account different sensitivities to mean stress in fatigue and distinguish between the tensile- and compressive-dominated failure modes.
