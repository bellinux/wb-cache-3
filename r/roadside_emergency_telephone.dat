25|$|Solar cells produce {{direct current}} {{electricity}} from sunlight {{which can be}} used to power equipment or to recharge a battery. The first practical application of photovoltaics was to power orbiting satellites and other spacecraft, but today the majority of photovoltaic modules are used for grid connected power generation. In this case an inverter is required to convert the DC to AC. There is a smaller market for off-grid power for remote dwellings, boats, recreational vehicles, electric cars, <b>roadside</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>telephones,</b> remote sensing, and cathodic protection of pipelines.|$|R
25|$|The {{numbers on}} {{distance}} marker posts are embedded into <b>emergency</b> <b>roadside</b> <b>telephone</b> numbers {{and are used}} by the emergency services to pinpoint incidents.|$|R
50|$|The number used on {{distance}} marker posts is also encoded into the numbers associated with motorway <b>emergency</b> <b>roadside</b> <b>telephones.</b> In this way motorway control centre staff can pinpoint the telephone {{from which a}} call is being made.|$|R
50|$|Control centres {{answer the}} orange <b>emergency</b> <b>roadside</b> <b>telephones</b> on the {{motorway}} and trunk road network, liaise with breakdown organisations, allocate Traffic Officers to incidents, monitor the CCTV system, control the electronic variable-message {{signs on the}} roads and supply information to the NTCC. Some RCCs are jointly staffed by the police.|$|R

50|$|Location marker posts (small {{roadside}} posts giving location definition {{data for}} maintenance and incident management use) are installed on motorways and many trunk roads at 100-metre intervals. These posts give a unit-less location index (actually the distance in kilometres from a defined reference {{point for the}} road). The digits on these posts are barely visible to motorists. The same location index information may also appear on roadside furniture such as lampposts and signal cabinets and be encoded into the <b>emergency</b> <b>roadside</b> <b>telephones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Numbered {{location}} markers of one type or another {{are used to}} identify specific locations along a road. Historically, milestones were used, but since the early 20th century they fell into disuse. However, for administrative and maintenance purposes, distance marker posts and driver location signs have been erected on motorways and certain dual carriageways.The numbers on distance marker posts are embedded into <b>emergency</b> <b>roadside</b> <b>telephone</b> numbers and are used by the emergency services to pinpoint incidents.The advent of the mobile phone meant that location information embedded into motorway <b>emergency</b> <b>telephone</b> systems was not being accessed by drivers and since 2007 driver location signs have been erected on many motorways. These contain important information about the location and carriageway direction, and the reference number should be quoted in full when contacting the emergency services.|$|R
50|$|Since {{at least}} 1980, {{motorways}} have had distance marker posts installed at 100 metre intervals alongside the hard shoulder. These posts {{are used to}} help pinpoint road locations for maintenance and emergency purposes, and also show the direction to the nearest <b>emergency</b> <b>roadside</b> <b>telephone.</b> The numbers on the posts, for which no units are given, are derived from the distance, in kilometres, of the post from a reference datum location such as a city centre, an administrative boundary or some other feature. On the M25 for example, distances are referenced to a point near Junction 31 even though {{the section of the}} ring road between Junction 31 (post 186.6) and Junction 1a (post 5.7) is the A282, not the M25.On motorways distance marker posts also bear an arrow pointing towards the location of the nearest <b>emergency</b> <b>telephone.</b>|$|R
50|$|Serco {{operates}} the Santander Cycles scheme (for Transport for London) and the NorthLink Ferries Northern Isles lifeline ferry service in Scotland. Serco {{also has a}} joint venture with Abellio, the international arm of Dutch national rail operator Nederlandse Spoorwegen, to operate passenger trains in the UK. Serco-Abellio has a 25-year concession for Merseyrail in Liverpool until 2028 and operated the Northern Rail franchise from December 2004 until March 2016. Serco's Home Affairs division, run by Tom Riall, also operates speed camera systems throughout the UK and, until November 2013, designed, wrote and tested the software that controls the matrix message signs, signals, <b>emergency</b> <b>roadside</b> <b>telephones</b> (SOS) and traffic monitoring on England's motorway network including, until 2011, the National Traffic Control Centre. It previously operated the Docklands Light Railway.|$|R

Some countries have a different emergency number for each of the different emergency services; these often differ only by the last digit. See List of <b>emergency</b> <b>telephone</b> numbers.|$|R

25|$|The <b>emergency</b> <b>{{telephone}}</b> {{number is}} a special case in the country's telephone number plan. In the past, calls to the <b>emergency</b> <b>telephone</b> number were often routed over special dedicated circuits. Though {{with the advent of}} electronic exchanges these calls are now often mixed with ordinary telephone traffic, they still may be able to access circuits that other traffic cannot. Often the system is set up so that once a call is made to an <b>emergency</b> <b>telephone</b> number, it must be answered. Should the caller abandon the call, the line may still be held until the emergency service answers and releases the call.|$|R
