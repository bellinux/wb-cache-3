5000|$|Under the Ryotwari System every <b>registered</b> <b>holder</b> of land is {{recognised}} as its proprietor, {{and pays}} direct to Government. He is {{at liberty to}} sublet his property, or to transfer it by gift, sale, or mortgage. He cannot be ejected by Government {{so long as he}} pays the fixed assessment, and has the option annually of increasing or diminishing his holding, or of entirely abandoning it. In unfavourable seasons remissions of assessment are granted for entire or partial loss of produce. The assessment is fixed in money, and does not vary from year to year, in those cases where water is drawn from a Government source of irrigation to convert dry land into wet, or into two-crop land, when an extra rent is paid to Government for the water so appropriated; nor is any addition made to the assessment for improvements effected at the Ryot's own expense. The Ryot under this system is virtually a Proprietor on a simple and perfect title, and has all the benefits of a perpetual lease without its responsibilities, inasmuch as he can at any time throw up his lands, but cannot be ejected so long as he pays his dues; he receives assistance in difficult seasons, and is irresponsible for the payment of his neighbours[...] [...] [...] The Annual Settlements under Ryotwari are often misunderstood, and it is necessary to explain that they are rendered necessary by the right accorded to the Ryot of diminishing or extending his cultivation from year to year. Their object is to determine how much of the assessment due on his holding the Ryot shall pay, and not to reassess the land. In these cases where no change occurs in the Ryots holding a fresh Potta or lease is not issued, and such parties are in no way affected by the Annual Settlement, which they are not required to attend.|$|E

On any toll booth the vehicle has to stop for paying the toll. We are {{trying to develop a}} system that would pay the toll automatically and reduce the queue at the toll booths. In this system camera is used for capturing the image of the vehicle number plate. The captured image would be converted into text using ANPR algorithm. Toll booth passes the vehicle plate number to the central server which holds the information about registered users. Server then uses this vehicle number to verify whether the user is <b>registered</b> account <b>holder</b> or not. If the user is <b>registered</b> account <b>holder</b> then server transmits the information about vehicle type, account balance to the toll booth. Based on the vehicle type, toll is deducted from the customer’s account and then the toll gate is opened. Central server is updated with user’s account balance using internet protocols by the toll booth the vehicle passes through. The user is updated about his account status via SMS...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} conveyancing risks which cannot be cured {{under the present}} legal regime for land registration in Nigeria. Two fundamental issues motivated this study. The first is that, in Nigeria, registration of title to land is mandatory and meant to assure certainty of registered title amongst other reasons. However, it is settled law that registration of title per se cannot cure any defect in the title or confer validity which it does not possess. This phenomenon not only exposed <b>registered</b> title <b>holders</b> to hidden conveyancing risks, but also threatened the effectiveness and public trust in registration of title regime. The second problem {{is the lack of}} appropriate risk control measures that are specifically designed for <b>registered</b> title <b>holders</b> in country. Consequently, this paper evaluates the existing conveyancing risks in the particular context of the extant rules on land registration. Although the paper commends legal efforts aim at strengthening land registration in Nigeria, it demonstrates that there is enormity of conveying perils which largely defeats the benefits of registering title to land. In that regard, the study proposes the establishment of title insurance as new commercial model that will be tailored for conveyancing risks control in the country. It concludes that since insurance regulation is the exclusive preserve of the Federal government, the National Insurance Commission should pioneer the reform suggested in this paper by invoking section 101 of the Insurance Act 2003...|$|R
