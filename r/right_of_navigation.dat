5|$|At the {{opposite}} end, at Ysgwrfa, the final five locks before Glynneath have been severed by a realignment {{of the road}} and the construction of a culvert, but the road has carried a lot less traffic since the A465 bypass was opened, and could possibly be rerouted along its original course, where the bridge over the canal still exists. The Neath Canal Act has not been repealed, and so there is still a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> along this section, which should ease the process of reinstating it. The terminus would then be near the Lamb and Flag public house, south of the final two locks, which are unlikely to be restored.|$|E
5|$|The Bristol and Exeter Railway {{opened in}} late 1853, {{and the effects}} on the Parrett Navigation were immediate. Despite {{petitions}} from users of the Westport Canal to keep their section open for navigation, the Commissioners opted to abandon the entire navigation; however, the Westport Canal was maintained for drain purposes only. Some boats continued to use the river to reach Langport and beyond until {{the early years of}} the 20th century. There is still a public <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> as far as Oath Lock, but very few private boats use the river, largely due to the fierce tides in the estuary and a lack of moorings along its route.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1971, the Drain {{had been}} navigable, but this {{privilege}} was removed at that time. It {{is unclear whether}} {{there was ever a}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation,</b> or whether the Black Sluice Commissioners simply allowed it. The entrance lock was , and most trade was between Boston and Donnington Bridge, with pleasure boating not being allowed prior to 1962. The lock was closed and removed in 1971, with little protest being made. More recently, the East Anglian Waterways Association promoted the idea that the Drain could again be made navigable {{as part of a larger}} scheme to improve leisure facilities. The local authorities which were part of the Fens Tourism consortium conducted a feasibility study, and this report was formally adopted as the Fens Waterways Link by the Environment Agency in 2004, with the support of the local authorities, the East Anglian Waterways Association and the Inland Waterways Association.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a public}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> between Pool Quay, near Welshpool, and Stourport. However this stretch of the river has little traffic, other than small {{pleasure}} boats, canoes and some tour boats in Shrewsbury. Below Stourport, where the river is more navigable for larger craft, users must obtain permits from the Canal & River Trust, who are the navigation authority. During spring freshet the river can be closed to navigation.|$|E
25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20thcentury the river was being used for pleasure craft and by 1920 there were craft based regularly at Stamford Bridge and Kirkham Abbey. After floods in 1930 damaged the lock gates at Kirkham several vessels were stranded upstream. In 1935 statutory <b>Right</b> <b>of</b> <b>Navigation</b> was revoked above Sutton Lock. There followed a long series of fights for public access against riparian interests which continue to the present day.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} {{section was}} {{the setting for}} a high-profile campaign by the fledgling Inland Waterways Association in 1947, involving the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> under Tunnel Lane bridge, which required the Great Western Railway to jack it up {{in order to allow}} boats to pass. These actions saved the section from closure. The southern section was restored by the National Trust between 1961 and 1964, after an attempt to close it was thwarted. The revived canal was re-opened by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and responsibility for it was transferred to British Waterways in 1988.|$|E

25|$|There {{is still}} a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> on Cowbridge Drain and Hobhole Drain, but they are {{isolated}} {{from the rest of}} the system by the derelict East Fen Lock. Restoration of this lock was proposed by the Lincolnshire Branch of the Inland Waterways Association in 1975, who sought to encourage use of the drains by offering a plaque to boats that used Cowbridge Lock, but no progress has been made with this, and the lock has been infilled. Hagnaby Lock, near the top of the West Fen Catchwater Drain has no gates, but it is usually possible to pass straight through, while the lock which bypassed Lade Bank pumping station on the Hobhole Drain has been converted to a sluice.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that the Lode was navigable beyond Soham. Lighters brought cargoes of corn to a water mill at Soham, and later brought coal when steam engines replaced the water wheel. Barley and timber were other important cargoes. Railways did not reach Soham until 1879, and resulted in the rapid demise of water-borne transport. Commercial traffic ceased about 1900, and the lode was described as un-navigable in a report by H. Dunn in 1906. There was a sluice at the entrance to the lode, with two sets of mitre gates, pointing in opposite directions, one to prevent flood waters from the Great Ouse entering the lode, and the other to raise the water level in the lode to make navigation easier. When the Anglian Water Authority was created by Act of Parliament in 1977, the lode was not listed as a navigation, and their successors, the Environment Agency, have taken this to mean that there is no <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation.</b>|$|E
500|$|A group {{supporting}} {{the restoration of}} the canal had been set up in the early 1950s independently of the Inland Waterways Association, with which it was subsequently merged. In 1955 John Gould, a trader on the eastern section of the waterway, successfully petitioned against the commission's failure to maintain the waterway and obtained damages for loss of business. In March 1956 a clause in the British Transport Commission (no 2) Act was presented to Parliament that would have removed the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> between Reading and Bath. The Act was opposed by Gould and by the local authorities along the canal. They were supported by a 22,000-signature petition to the Queen, brought to London from Bristol by water; parts of the canal had to be traversed by canoe. This campaign led to an inquiry by a Parliamentary Select Committee. The committee supported the suspension of the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation,</b> and the Bill passed through the House of Commons but was amended by the House of Lords to include a clause to enforce [...] "no further deterioration". In July 1958, the Bowes Committee published their Inquiry into Inland Waterways which specifically mentioned the Kennet and Avon finding [...] "no justification for restoring the section from Reading to Bath".|$|E

2500|$|Breaching of {{the banks}} by floodwater was a continual problem, with six {{breaches}} of the north bank recorded between 1821 and 1882, and eight of the south bank in the same period. Measurement showed that the river level rose by [...] for every [...] of rain falling on the river's catchment area. The arrival of railways in the area resulted in a rapid decline of river traffic. A railway from Boston to Spalding opened in 1848, while the line from Spalding opened to Bourne in 1866 and on to Sleaford in 1872. Although occasional boats were still reaching Bourne in 1857, the self-acting doors at Tongue End were replaced by a sluice in the 1860s, which prevented passage from the Glen to the Bourne Eau, although the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation</b> was not officially revoked until 1962, as part of flood defence measures which included {{the replacement of the}} sluice by a pumping station in 1966.|$|E

60|$|If {{the claim}} made by Mr. Clay was {{just when the}} {{population}} of States bordering {{on the shores of}} the Lakes was only 3,400,000, it now derives greater force and equity from the increased population, wealth, production, and tonnage of the States on the Canadian frontier. Since Mr. Clay advanced his argument in behalf of our right the principle for which he contended has been frequently, and by various nations, recognized by law or by treaty, and has been extended to several other great rivers. By the treaty concluded at Mayence in 1831 the Rhine was declared free from the point where it is first navigable into the sea. By the convention between Spain and Portugal concluded in 1835 the navigation of the Douro throughout its whole extent was made free for the subjects of both Crowns. In 1853 the Argentine Confederation by treaty threw open the free navigation of the Parana and the Uruguay to the merchant vessels of all nations. In 1856 the Crimean War was closed by a treaty which provided for the free navigation of the Danube. In 1858 Bolivia by treaty declared that it regarded the rivers Amazon and La Plata, in accordance with fixed principles of national law, as highways or channels opened by nature for the commerce of all nations. In 1859 the Paraguay was made free by treaty, and in December, 1866, the Emperor of Brazil by imperial decree declared the Amazon to be open to the frontier of Brazil to the merchant ships of all nations. The greatest living British authority on this subject, while asserting the abstract right of the British claim, says: It seems difficult to deny that Great Britain may ground her refusal upon strict law, but it is equally difficult to deny, first, that in so doing she exercises harshly an extreme and hard law; secondly, that her conduct with respect to the navigation of the St. Lawrence is in glaring and discreditable inconsistency with her conduct with respect to the navigation of the Mississippi. On the ground that she possessed a small domain in which the Mississippi took its rise, she insisted on the right to navigate the entire volume of its waters. On the ground that she possesses both banks of the St. Lawrence, where it disembogues itself into the sea, she denies to the United States the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>navigation,</b> though about one-half of the waters of Lakes Ontario. Erie, Huron, and Superior, and the whole of Lake Michigan, through which the river flows, are the property of the United States. The whole nation is interested in securing cheap transportation from the agricultural States of the West to the Atlantic Seaboard. To the citizens of those States it secures a greater return for their labor; to the inhabitants of the seaboard it affords cheaper food; to the nation, an increase in the annual surplus of wealth. It is hoped that the Government of Great Britain will see the justice of abandoning the narrow and inconsistent claim to which her Canadian Provinces have urged her adherence.|$|E
