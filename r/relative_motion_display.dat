40|$|<b>Relative</b> <b>motion</b> {{information}} {{is required for}} solving many complex visual tasks, such as depth perception by motion parallax and motion-induced figure/ground segmentation. However, {{little is known about}} the neural substrate for <b>relative</b> <b>motion.</b> To explore the neural mechanisms underlying <b>relative</b> <b>motion,</b> we recorded single unit responses to <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> in macaque VI and V 2. We found that a substantial portion of V 1 (62. 2 %) and V 2 (70 %) neurons respond to <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> inputs. These neurons usually show V-shaped tuning curves to <b>relative</b> <b>motion,</b> with minimum response at zero <b>relative</b> <b>motion.</b> They respond predominantly to <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> rather than to absolute <b>motion.</b> The <b>relative</b> ratio of target velocity to background velocity, rather than the absolute amplitude of either target/background velocity or the difference of the two determines neural responses. In area VI, relative-motion-defined boundaries matching a cell's preferred orientation evoke excitatory responses in a <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> sensitive neuron. However, the responses are not strong enough to make such a neuron selective to the orientation of the relative-motion-defined boundaries. <b>Relative</b> <b>motion</b> sensitive neurons may participate in segregating objects from a moving background as well as preprocessing complex motion patterns. (cont.) Utilizing a new random-dot stereogram, we tested further if these <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> sensitive neurons contribute to the processing of motion parallax, as suggested by Nakayama and Loomis (1974). Several factors, i. e., the symmetric V shaped tuning to <b>relative</b> <b>motion,</b> the lack of neurons tuned to the degree of differential motion and the lack of correlation between disparity and <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> tuning, indicate that those neurons are unlikely to process motion parallax directly. To summarize, we confirm the existence of <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> sensitive neurons in macaque VI and V 2. Although these neurons are not directly involved in processing motion parallax, they facilitate other motion processing such as figure/ground segmentation and motion discontinuity detection. by An Cao.

40|$|During {{everyday}} viewing {{we rarely}} keep our eyes still. Our visual {{system has to}} take these eye movements into account {{in order to create}} a veridical percept of object motion. When we make smooth pursuit eye movements, the perceived velocity of a moving object can be obtained by summing two signals, one estimating retinal image velocity and the other estimating eye velocity. Previous studies have shown that the gains of these two signals differ. Here we investigate whether they also differ in their latencies. Observers compared the peak velocity of sinusoidally moving dot patterns viewed during sinusoidal smooth pursuit eye movements and during fixation. The relative gains and phases of the two signals were estimated from the amplitude matches by fitting a simple linear model. At VSS 2005, we showed that the model described the data well for most observers, but the estimated signal gains and phases showed considerable variability. Also, the gain ratio was very low for most observers, suggesting they ignored eye-velocity information and judged instead the <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> in the <b>display.</b> Here, we tested whether removing the vertical edges in the stimulus window, using a large-field cylindrical screen, promoted head-centred judgements. Using this display, observers seem more able to judge head-centred sinusoidal motion consistently during smooth eye pursuit. Relative signal gain was comparable to that previously reported in the literature. Moreover, the results suggest that retinal motion signals lag eye-movement signals by a small amount...|$|R

Ultrasonic welding is {{conducted}} using pure aluminum sheets to investigate {{effect of the}} transitional welding processes comprised of three transitional stages on {{the formation of the}} weld microstructure. In the first stage of ultrasonic welding, the <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> mainly occurred between the workpieces, and a partially bonded region was observed in the weld interface.

A {{problem of}} <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> of {{orbiting}} bodies is investigated on {{the example of}} the free motion of any body ejected from the orbital station that stays in a circular orbit around the earth.

We know that their passive orbital motion obeys Kepler’s laws. But how does one of them move relative to the other? This <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> is important, say, for the spacecraft docking in orbit. If two satellites are brought together but have a (small) nonzero relative velocity, they will drift apart nonrectilinearly. In unusual conditions of the orbital flight, navigation is quite different from what we are used to here on the earth, and our intuition fails us. The study of the <b>relative</b> <b>motion</b> of the spacecraft reveals many extraordinary features that are hard to reconcile with common sense and our everyday experience.

In the large environment, mapping can be significantly accelerated by multiple robots exploring different parts of the environment. Accordingly, a key problem is how to integrate these local maps built by different robots into a single global map. In this paper, we propose an approach for simultaneous merging of multiple grid maps by the robust motion averaging. The main idea of this approach is to recover all global motions for map merging from a set of <b>relative</b> <b>motions.</b> Therefore, it firstly adopts the pair-wise map merging method to estimate <b>relative</b> <b>motions</b> for grid map pairs. To obtain as many reliable <b>relative</b> <b>motions</b> as possible, a graph-based sampling scheme is utilized to efficiently remove unreliable <b>relative</b> <b>motions</b> obtained from the pair-wise map merging.

This questions whether observers need {{direct access to}} retinal motion during pursuit.
