40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} role of <b>real</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>misalignment</b> on long-run growth {{for a set of}} ninety {{countries}} using time series data from 1980 to 2004. We first estimate a panel data model (fixed and random effects) for the real exchange rate in order to pro-duce estimates of the equilibrium real exchange rate and this is then used to construct measures of <b>real</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>misalignment.</b> We provide an alternative set of estimates of RER misalignment using panel cointegration methods. The results for the two-step System GMM panel growth models indicate that the coefficients for <b>real</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>misalignment</b> are positive for different model specification and samples, which means that a more depreciated (appreciated) real exchange rate helps (harms) long-run growth.

40|$|The {{exchange}} rate {{is one of}} the most challenging macroeconomic policy issues in any economy. There is a general agreement that policymakers should aim at avoiding <b>real</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>misalignment.</b> To avoid <b>real</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>misalignment,</b> it is important to identify the equilibrium real {{exchange rate}}. To identify the equilibrium real exchange rate it is necessary to understand the drivers of the real exchange rate, and investigate the extent to which the real exchange rate is driven by various determinants. Despite the fact that the real exchange rate is a very important component of macroeconomic policy, empirical investigation of the real exchange rate in Namibia is very limited. It is against this background that the objective of this study is to estimate the equilibrium real exchange rate and the resulting <b>real</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>misalignment</b> for Namibia during period 1970 to 2004. It also investigates the impact of <b>real</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>misalignment</b> on economic performance and competitiveness. The equilibrium real exchange rate and resulting real exchange rate misalignments were estimated using theoretical models and the application of time series econometric techniques. The fundamental approach model and the model of real exchange rate and real prices of commodities exports were estimated using the Johansen full information maximum likelihood technique. According to the estimation based on the fundamental model the real exchange rate is determined by terms of trade, openness of the economy and ratio of investment to GDP. Equilibrium real exchange rate was estimated and the results showed that the real exchange rate was misaligned. Since Namibia is a commodity exporting country the relationship between the real exchange rate and prices of commodities was also investigated. The analysis revealed that there is a long-run co-movement between real exchange rate and prices of commodity exports. Increase in prices of commodities causes the real exchange rate to appreciate. There was some overvaluation and undervaluation. The VAR methodology was implemented to test the impact of <b>real</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>misalignment</b> on economic performance and competitiveness. The analysis revealed that <b>real</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>misalignment</b> hampers economic growth and competitiveness. It is important for policymakers to monitor the real exchange rate and ensure that it does not diverge significantly from its equilibrium value. Reduction in <b>real</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>misalignment</b> is also important to ensure that the country achieves a high level of export and remains competitive in order to have a sustainable level of growth. As a commodity exporting country, Namibia can have either a flexible nominal exchange rate regime which facilitates slow change of relative inflation rate, or price and wage flexibility to facilitate the maintenance of the nominal exchange rate peg. Alternatively, Namibia is a good candidate for pegging the currency to the prices of export commodities because its export is concentrated on few products. This option implies that Namibia leaves the CMA. However, it is important to note that Namibia is a proponent of regional integration and a move away from the CMA will not be consistent with the plans of SADC to establish a monetary union by 2016.

The empirical results also show that the exchange rate volatility has merely promoted the Malaysian imports during the crisis period. This suggests that the exchange rate misalignment and volatility are important determinants in inspiring Malaysian import flows, especially during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. ...|$|E

The limited export competitiveness has hampered external demand, growth and employment. Applying, {{for the first time}} to North Africa, the stock-flow approach to the <b>real</b> equilibrium <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> this paper evaluates the countries' <b>real</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>misalignments</b> during the past three decades. While Egypt experienced periods of substantial misalignment, including in recent years, the <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> in Morocco and Tunisia have broadly reflected the underlying fundamentals. In all three countries structural factors are key to boosting exports, alongside of avoiding sizeable future misalignments. Intra-regional trade 9 ̆ 6 both with North Africa and the rest of the continent 9 ̆ 6 together with greater orientation to fast growing emerging markets could also raise countries' external competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|The {{equilibrium}} <b>real</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> {{is the one}} of the {{key concepts}} in the macroeconomic and policy analysis. The im-portance of this concept yet increases in a currency union. In general, the <b>real</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> <b>misalignments</b> are per-ceived to be the causes of the loss of a competitiveness, growth slowdowns and currency crises in cases of overvalua-tion, overheating and inflation in cases of undervaluation, sectoral misallocations of resources and global economic im-balances. In a case of a currency union the divergent dynamics of <b>real</b> effective <b>exchange</b> <b>rates</b> in the individual coun-tries—both the actual and an equilibrium—will exacerbate both economic and political tensions (in addition to above mentioned problems) and may lead to the collapse of not only the monetary union per se but the underlying integration processes as well. This paper employs the estimation of the BEER (behavioral equilibrium <b>exchange</b> <b>rate)</b> for the seve...|$|R
