In 2015, Dalhousie received a GOLD rating from AASHE STARS (Version 2.0). In 2009, the university signed the University and College Presidents’ Climate Change Statement of Action for Canada to <b>reduce</b> <b>emissions</b> of greenhouse gases. Dalhousie is also a signatory of UNEP's International Declaration on Cleaner Production. In 1999, the university signed the Talloires Declaration, which committed Dalhousie and other higher education institutions to developing, creating, supporting, and maintaining sustainability.|$|E

5|$|In November 2009, Wright was {{sufficiently}} {{concerned that the}} Climate Change Response (Moderated Emissions Trading) Amendment bill would result in increased emissions that she publicly urged politicians three times not to adopt the National Government's legislation. She opposed the removal of a firm cap on emissions, the reduction of price incentives to <b>reduce</b> <b>emissions,</b> and the heavy subsidies from taxpayers granted to emissions-intensive industry and agriculture by the intensity-based allocation of free units.|$|E
5|$|On 6 December 2007, the New Zealand Emission Unit Register (NZEUR) was established. The NZEUR has {{the role}} of issuing, holding, {{transferring}} and retiring emission units {{in terms of the}} Kyoto Protocol. The initial use of the NZEUR was to record Kyoto emission units allocated to firms enrolled in the Ministry for the Environment’s Projects to <b>Reduce</b> <b>Emissions</b> and Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements programmes, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s Permanent Forest Sink Initiative.|$|E
5|$|Jatropha is {{native to}} Mexico and Central America and was likely transported to India and Africa in the 1500s by Portuguese sailors {{convinced}} it had medicinal uses. In 2008, recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and <b>reduce</b> <b>emissions,</b> Mexico passed a law to push developing biofuels that don't threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of land with a high potential to produce jatropha. The Yucatán Peninsula, for instance, {{in addition to being}} a corn producing region, also contains abandoned sisal plantations, where the growing of Jatropha for biodiesel production would not displace food.|$|E

5|$|Bømlo Municipal Council voted {{unanimously}} {{in favor of}} the Triangle Link on 22 February 1988. Two days later, the issue was discussed in Stord Municipal Council. Olav Akselsen at first proposed supporting the pontoon bridge, but after a trial vote he withdrew the proposal and also Stord supported the Triangle Link. The following week, Sveio Municipal Council voted in favor the Triangle Link, without either a debate or dissent in the council. Fitjar Municipal Council voted on 15 March to work with both proposals. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the Triangle Link was published in early 1989, estimating the costs at NOK890 million. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry remain, but the other four ferry services be terminated. The report concluded that the maintenance costs of the fixed link would be lower than the subsidies of the ferry, that the project would be economical of society and would <b>reduce</b> <b>emissions.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} recognises {{that there}} are no viable alternative aviation fuels, and whilst it accepts that the exemption of aviation fuel from fuel tax is anomalous, it sees no scope for a unilateral approach in addressing this. The strategy adopted in the White Paper seeks to mitigate the global impact of air transport primarily through emissions trading schemes. Although the Kyoto Protocol implemented emissions trading as a means to <b>reduce</b> <b>emissions</b> at national levels, the global nature of air transport means that all air travel is excluded from this mechanism. The government is seeking to redress this through the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which has been working on the environmental issue since 1998, but progress is slow. In the meantime efforts are being made to include aviation in the EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with an original target to implement this by 2008. In 2006 the government re-affirmed this policy as the best approach for addressing the climate change impacts of aviation, and current proposals aim at accomplishing this for all flights within the EU by 2011, with the scheme being extended to include all flights to and from the EU the following year.|$|E
