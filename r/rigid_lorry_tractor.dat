After a short recall to the problems concerning the sabotage, some transport supply models are illustrated for sea and road transport as alternative modes. As concerns the transport demand, an estimation procedure based on RP/SP surveys, is suggested. The proposed models are applied for a comparative analysis of the road, railway and maritime transport alternatives between two Italian regions, taking into consideration also two different charge units: <b>lorry</b> with <b>tractor</b> and <b>lorry</b> without <b>tractor.</b> The analysis is made both according to a MTO and a Maritime Operator.

The study used both quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques. Data were collected through in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, direct observations and document reviews. A structured household questionnaire {{was used as the}} basic tool to collect socio-economic and production data pertaining to A 1 farmers. Using a livelihoods conceptual framework and elicitation approach, the study revealed interesting points with regard to the assets extended to and acquired by A 1 households in Baines Hope and Ingwenya farm in Goromonzi District. The study found that while some households engaged in non-agricultural activities, for most households crop production was the main source of livelihoods. Although maize was the dominant crop, there was some diversification into soya beans, potatoes, tobacco, sorghum and groundnuts. In this respect, almost all households were able to utilise their landholdings to ensure household food security. Further, several households exchanged grain as payment for agricultural labour services while surplus grain was sold. The provision of land had also a positive impact of enabling some beneficiaries to acquire certain assets {{that they did not have}} before they were resettled, or that they would not have been able to accumulate if they had remained in the areas they previously lived. The acquired assets included livestock, ox-ploughs, scotch carts, <b>lorries,</b> <b>tractors,</b> passenger vehicles and bigger houses. Some of these assets were used t...|$|R

40|$|Retrofit {{introduction}} of contour marking for lorries. The Netherlands has an annual number of approximately 300 fatal or serious injury crashes involving <b>lorries</b> (<b>rigid</b> <b>lorries,</b> articulated lorries and trailers). European Commission CARE data indicates that in 2010 around 5000 people died on EU roads in crashes involving Heavy Goods Vehicles (HGVs), and 75 % of these fatalities were occupants of other vehicles. Road traffic crashes involving lorries {{tend to be}} more serious than other crashes because of the great size and mass of these vehicles. Part of these crashes are due to lateral and rear-end collisions at dusk or in the dark. Previous SWOV research has shown that contour marking on lorries can contribute to the prevention of these types of crashes. EU directive 2007 / 35 /EC states that from 10 July 2008, lorries with a minimum weight of 7. 5 tonnes and trailers from a maximum mass of 3. 5 tonnes must be fitted with contour marking that is approved and applied in the correct manner in order to pass the type approval test. From 10 July 2011, retroreflecting contour marking must not only be applied to new vehicle types, but also to older vehicle types that are licensed for the first time (European Union, 2007 a, 2007 b). The contour marking is not compulsory for existing vehicles that are already licensed. 3 M wants to know which substantive arguments can be put forward to plead for {{introduction of}} contour marking for the existing vehicle park in the Netherlands and the European Union, the so-called retrofit, and asked SWOV to investigate the issue. The 3 M request resulted in the following research questions: - What road safety effects can be expected as a result of retrofit application of contour marking on lorries in the Netherlands? - What are the social costs and benefits of this measure and is the measure socially cost-effective? - What are the costs and benefits for transport companies? - What is the effect of retrofit contour marking on the number of fatalities and seriously injured in the EU due to traffic crashes? Dutch and international literature were studied and a cost-benefit analysis was conducted to answer these questions. Based on Dutch and international research, it is estimated that in the present situation in the Netherlands, retrofit contour marking leads to an estimated maximum prevention of 3 fatalities, 16 serious road injuries and 481 crashes per year. This data is only valid for a situation in which none of the vehicles in the Dutch vehicle fleet would be fitted with contour marking and contour marking would be applied to all vehicles at the same time. This is not the actual situation and lorries are replaced when their service life has ended. In addition, due to previous European legislation, contour marking will already be applied to part of the vehicle fleet on 1 January 2015 (commencement date for the measure in our calculations). Statistics Netherlands (CBS) data indicates that the average lifespan of <b>rigid</b> <b>lorries</b> and of articulated lorries is 13 years, and of trailers the average lifespan is 22 years. Gradual implementation of contour marking would imply that the entire fleet of trailers would continue to drive without retrofit for approximately 11 years, and the entire fleet of <b>rigid</b> <b>lorries</b> and articulated lorries for approximately 6, 5 years. This data could be used to calculate the effect of implementing retrofit contour marking for all vehicles at once, if not for the fact that some lorries have already been fitted with contour marking. The fact that adaptations have already taken place, affects both the relevant fleet size (the share without retrofit) and the average lifespan of that share. There are various ways to include fleet changes in the calculation of the effect. The present calculations show that both factors (fleet size and lifespan) influence safety proportionally. Therefore, their effect on safety is the same, irrespective of, for example, fleet size or lifespan being half the size. If the above is taken into account, the total savings over the period during which the measure is being introduced (i. e. from 1 January 2015 until contour marking has been applied to all lorries) amounts to: • 8 fatalities; • 42 serious road injuries; • 1268 crashes. Chapter 2 discusses the reasons for possible over- or underestimates of these numbers. The costs of the retrofit introduction of contour marking for trucks in the Netherlands consist of the costs of the marking itself and the costs of applying the marking. The costs of applying the marking have been calculated for two different scenarios: a ‘maximum’ scenario in which full side contour markings are applied to the sides of all trucks, and a ‘minimum’ scenario in which only the bottom and the upper corners are marked, in accordance with the minimum requirements of the European Union...|$|R

40|$|The {{vibration}} isolation efficiency of seating has been evaluated in 100 work vehicles in 14 categories (cars, vans, lift trucks, <b>lorries,</b> <b>tractors,</b> buses, dumpers, excavators, helicopters, armoured vehicles, mobile cranes, grass rollers, mowers and milk floats). Seat isolation efficiency, {{expressed by the}} SEAT value, was determined for all seats (67 conventional seats and 33 suspension seats) from the vertical acceleration measured on the floors and on the seats of the vehicles. For most categories of vehicle, the average SEAT value was less than 100 %, indicating that the average seat provided some attenuation of vibration. However, there were large variations in SEAT values between vehicles within categories. Two alternative vibration frequency weightings (Wb from BS 6841, 1987; Wk from ISO 2631, 1997) yielded SEAT values that differed by less than 6 %. Overall, the SEAT values determined by two alternative methods (the ratio of r. m. s. values and the ratio of vibration dose values) differed by less than 4 · 5 % when using weighting Wb, although larger differences may be expected in some situations. The median SEAT value for the suspension seats was 84 · 6 %; the median SEAT value for the conventional seats was 86 · 9 % (based on weighting Wb and the ratio of r. m. s. values). Predicted SEAT values were obtained assuming that each seat could be interchanged between vehicles without altering its transmissibility. The calculations suggest that 94 % of the vehicles investigated might benefit from changing the current seat to a seat {{from one of the}} other vehicles investigated. Although the predictions are based on assumptions that will not always apply, it is concluded that the severity of whole-body vibration exposures in many work environments can be lessened by improvements to seating dynamics...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} {{the number of}} workers in Great Britain with significant occupational exposure to whole body vibration (WBV) and to identify the common sources of exposure and the occupations and industries where such exposures arise. METHODS: A postal questionnaire was posted to a random community sample of 22 194 men and women of working age. Among other things, the questionnaire asked about exposure to WBV in the past week, including occupational and common non-occupational sources. Responses were assessed by occupation and industry, and national prevalence estimates were derived from census information. Estimates were also made of the average estimated daily personal dose of vibration (eVDV). RESULTS: From the 12 907 responses it was estimated that 7. 2 million men and 1. 8 million women in Great Britain are exposed to WBV at work in a 1 week period if the occupational use of cars, vans, buses, trains, and motor cycles is included within the definition of exposure. The eVDV of > 374 000 men and 9000 women was estimated to exceed a proposed British Standard action level of 15 ms- 1. 75. Occupations in which the estimated exposures most often exceeded 15 ms- 1. 75 included forklift truck and mechanical truck drivers, farm owners and managers, farm workers, and drivers of road goods vehicles. These occupations also contributed the largest estimated numbers of workers in Great Britain with such levels of exposure. The highest estimated median occupational eVDVs were found in forklift truck drivers, drivers of road goods vehicles, bus and coach drivers, and technical and wholesale sales representatives, among whom a greater contribution to total dose was received from occupational exposures than from non-occupational ones; but in many other occupations the reverse applied. The most common sources of occupational exposure to WBV are cars, vans, forklift trucks, <b>lorries,</b> <b>tractors,</b> buses, and loaders. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to whole body vibration is common, but only a small proportion of exposures exceed the action level proposed in British standards, and in many occupations, non-occupational sources are more important than those at work.
