5|$|Belichick, {{who came}} to the Browns after 12 years mostly with the Giants under Bill Parcells, quickly made his mark by restricting media access to the team. He acted gruff or bored at press conferences, shrugging, <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and often giving short answers to long questions. This bred the {{perception}} that the new coach was not a good communicator and lacked a vision for the team. Behind the scenes, however, he was trying to remake the Browns. He reformed Cleveland's scouting methods and, in conjunction with player personnel director Mike Lombardi, tried to form a coherent identity: a big and strong cold-weather team. Belichick's new way forward, however, did not immediately translate to on-field success. Cleveland's record only improved slightly in 1991 to 6–10 as the offense struggled to produce scoring drives and the defense was plagued by injuries. Kosar was a rare bright spot, passing for almost 3,500yards and 18 touchdowns. Bridging the end of the 1990 season and the beginning of 1991, the quarterback threw a then-record 307 straight passes without an interception. Kosar broke his ankle twice and sat out for most of the 1992 season, leaving quarterback Mike Tomczak under center. The team finished with a 7–9 record and did not make the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|His father coached {{him until}} high school, and was {{especially}} tough. When Kinsler was 13 years old, {{and the best}} player on a PONY league team coached by his father that was playing for a championship, his dad caught Kinsler <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as he gave the team orders. [...] "I benched him, without hesitation", said his father. With Kinsler on the bench, the team lost the game.|$|E
500|$|According to women's {{swimming}} captain Lisa Forrest, Tonelli adopted populist {{tactics in}} championing the athletes' cause. He said that Fraser was sending [...] "wheat {{to feed the}} Russian army, wool to clothe the army and Australian metal to make Russian guns", claiming that this contradicted the proposed protest against the invasion and Russian military aggression. Tonelli's anti-authoritarian and individualistic style manifested itself during media appearances, including a news interview in which he debated with Reverend Lance Shilton, who had called the athletes traitors. Shilton expressed sympathy for the athletes, which Tonelli interpreted as condescension. He responded by <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and twirling his finger, a gaffe that was shown on national television; Tonelli mistakenly thought that only his voice was being broadcast {{at the time and}} that the images were showing something else. Forrest said that [...] "the damage was doneone of our most prominent anti-boycott lobbyists ... looked like a smart alec".|$|E

500|$|Tonelli graduated, {{returned}} to Australia, {{and won the}} 100m freestyle, butterfly and backstroke events at the 1979 Australian Championships. The following year, he repeated the freestyle and butterfly victories in times of 51.80s and 56.64s to gain selection for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow; he was also chosen for the 100m and 200m backstroke after finishing second to Kerry. However, another obstacle arose with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, {{which resulted in a}} boycott of the Games by {{a large part of the}} Western world, led by the United States. The Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was also the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee, and significant political pressure came to bear on the athletes to boycott the Games. Tonelli however, knew that only the sportspeople would suffer from a boycott and that trade relations would continue unabated. He took a leadership role among the Australian athletes to fight for their right to compete. According to women's captain Lisa Forrest, Tonelli adopted populist tactics in championing the athletes' cause. He said that Fraser was sending [...] "wheat to feed the Russian army, wool to clothe the army and Australian metal to make Russian guns", saying that this contradicted the proposed boycott in protest against Soviet military policy. Tonelli's anti-authoritarian and individualistic style manifested itself during media appearances, including a news interview in which he debated with Reverend Lance Shilton, who had referred to the athletes as traitors. Shilton expressed sympathy to the athletes, which Tonelli interpreted as condescension. Unaware that the camera was broadcasting images of him, Tonelli responded by <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and twirling his finger, a gaffe that was shown on national television. Forrest said that [...] "the damage was doneone of our most prominent anti-boycott lobbyists ... looked like a smart alec".|$|E
2500|$|The {{massacre}} {{was mentioned}} {{three times in}} the April 17 episode of hit show American Idol: First, show host Ryan Seacrest expressed [...] "thoughts and prayers" [...] on behalf of the producers of the show and the network; contestant Chris Richardson from Chesapeake, Virginia dedicated his performance to the victims and their families; judge Simon Cowell noted [...] "how difficult this week was for all of us." [...] Cowell was caught <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> on camera as a contestant was expressing sympathy for Tech victims. At first, this was misinterpreted as his showing his disrespect. Cowell later clarified that he was discussing the contestant's performance with another judge. This was confirmed by an uncut re-broadcast of the moment on the following night.|$|E
2500|$|On Tuesday, April 17, 2007, the {{day after}} the Virginia Tech massacre, in which a student named Seung-Hui Cho used guns to kill 32 {{students}} and professors before committing suicide, while contestant Chris Richardson and Ryan Seacrest were discussing the shooting after Chris's critique, Simon Cowell apparently appeared to be <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> at the incident, when he was actually speaking to Paula Abdul and did not hear what Chris had said. On the results show the next day, Cowell stated: [...] "I may not be the nicest person in the world, but I would never, ever, ever, disrespect those families or those victims, and I felt it was important to set the record straight." [...] To clear Cowell's name, a video was shown on the result show which showed Cowell and Abdul talking with an inset of Chris and Seacrest discussing the shooting. Also, Seacrest began the performance show by acknowledging what had happened the day before.|$|E
60|$|So {{we leave}} him, chuckling and <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> at the convent gate, and wind slowly down again through the cloud. At last {{emerging}} from it, {{we come in}} sight of the village far below, and the flat green country intersected by rivulets; which is pleasant and fresh to see after the obscurity and haze of the convent--no disrespect to the raven, or the holy friars.|$|R

2500|$|To Malone and ABC executives' surprise, Todd {{became an}} [...] "immensely popular" [...] {{character}} during the storyline. As his popularity grew, {{and as a}} solution {{not to have to}} kill off what had become a perceived monster, Malone and executive producer Susan Bedsow Horgan chose a controversial option [...] the decision to complicate Todd by ensuring that he was not a one-dimensional rapist. Malone and Horgan started Todd's transition into a more well-rounded character with their second transition of Powell. They had Powell attempt suicide and soon confess to raping Marty. He is publicly forgiven by Marty herself, which enrages Todd when he and fellow rapist Zach receive eight-year sentences behind prison compared to Powell's three months of jail time. Todd makes a vow that he will be out of prison in three months as well. To carry out this vow, Todd was written to escape by [...] "drugging himself, waking from a coma to leap from a speeding ambulance, and then reviving himself again by stabbing a knife through his hand while <b>rolling</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> heavenward" [...] and saying the pain felt good. The scary determination of the character had become characteristic of him by then, and he often seemed superhuman. Within the story, he wants revenge on the person he feels is most responsible for his prison time, Nora. With his escape from prison, he sets out to attack the currently blind Nora. Todd stalks and torments her, but she is spared from his attack by her then-husband Bo Buchanan (Robert S. Woods) showing up before Todd can finish the assault and rape her.|$|E
