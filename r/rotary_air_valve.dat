40|$|This paper {{explains}} the procedure {{used to determine}} the amount of air leakage being generated from the use of a drop-through rotary valve in a full-scale pneumatic conveying system. When producing a set ofpneumatic conveying characteristics for a test program, <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> <b>air</b> leakage is often not considered. In reality, the air mass flowrate in the conveying line will be less than the total supplied air mass flowrate due to air leakage through the rotary valve. By measuring the air leakage and adjusting the total supplied air mass flowrate to represent the actual air mass flowrate travelling through the conveying line, a more accurate representation of the conveying conditions can be obtained. Hence the design of pneumatic conveying systems can be determined more precisely. Tests have been performed and plots have been produced showing both the pneumatic conveying characteristics before and after <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> <b>air</b> leakage has been taken into account. These results show that <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> <b>air</b> leakage can have quite an effect, with some tests losing more than 50010 ofthe supplied air mass flowrate through the rotary valve...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explains}} the procedure {{used to determine}} the amount of air leakage expelled from two different sized drop-through rotary valves. When designing a pneumatic conveying system, <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> <b>air</b> leakage may be overlooked, believed to be only a minor factor. This is somewhat true when conveying in dilute-phase where low pressures are generated, however in dense-phase pneumatic conveying where higher pressures can be produced, <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> <b>air</b> leakage can be a high proportion of the supplied air. Knowing the air leakage present for any given situation, the total supplied air mass flowrate can be adjusted to represent the actual air mass flowrate travelling through the conveying line, thus giving a more accurate representation of the actual conveying conditions. A series of tests have been performed from which a series of graphs have been produced. Comparisons have been made for the air leakage through the different sized rotary valves and also these results have been compared to two existing models used in the prediction of <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> <b>air</b> leakage...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>valve</b> <b>air</b> leakage is an {{important}} parameter for the design and operation of many dilute- and dense-phase pneumatic conveying systems. Previous methods to estimate air leakage have been largely empirical and have been found inaccurate and/or limited in their use. This paper describes a new theoretical model that has been developed to estimate <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> (radial clearance) <b>air</b> leakage. Model predictions are compared with experimental data obtained on a rotating and stationary valve subjected {{to a wide range}} of operating pressures typical of dilute- and dense-phase systems. Knowing accurately the air leakage present for any given situation, the required total supplied air mass flow rate can be determined properly for the pneumatic conveying system, so that optimal transport velocities can be established...|$|R
40|$|Industry widely uses {{rotary valves}} and blow tanks for the {{pneumatic}} conveying of products, each having their {{pros and cons}} depending on the specific application. This article shows the differing results obtained when low-velocity conveying a product through a common pipeline using both a drop-through rotary valve and a bottom-discharge blow tank feeder. A number of issues arise in the rotary valve system, the main one being <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> <b>air</b> leakage. A blow tank system, on the other hand, does not leak, as it is an enclosed system. The experimental results show dramatic differences in product throughput. Further exploration leads to a novel modification being made to the rotary valve system {{in an attempt to}} increase its capacity. The result of this modification shows a slight increase in output tonnage, but still significantly less than that obtained from the blow tank...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experimental programme on the dynamic behaviour of <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> {{performed in a}} large-scale pipeline apparatus. Dynamic flow tests were performed at large (full) scale, since previous quasi-steady flow tests at small scale {{did not lead to}} realistic results. Investigations in a large-scale pipeline apparatus lead {{to a better understanding of}} the physical processes associated with the dynamic performance of <b>air</b> <b>valves.</b> Float type <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> of nominal diameter of 50 and 100 mm were tested in geometrically similar 200 and 500 mm test sections, to allow for the assessment of dynamic scale effects and the development of dimensionless parameter groups and dynamic scale laws. The approach in the determination of the dynamic performance of <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> was to measure their response to flow acceleration/ decelerations, which are imposed upon the valve. In this way, the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> behaviour following events like system start-up, pump trip and pipe rupture is simulated.

40|$|Abstractâˆ’Thermal stress {{deformation}} is {{a disadvantage}} of the <b>rotary</b> <b>air</b> preheater, {{which results in}} leakages of fluids and decrease of efficiency of the thermal system. To evaluate the results of deformation during its operation, the tem-perature distribution of storage materials is calculated by solving a simplified model. In this developed method, the effect of dimensionless parameters on the temperature distribution of <b>rotary</b> <b>air</b> preheater was investigated and compared {{with the results of}} modified heat transfer coefficient method. By solving coordination, structural and geometrical equa-tions, and boundary condition in thermal-elastic theory, the thermal stress distributions in <b>rotary</b> <b>air</b> preheater are ob-tained in an analytical method. Experimental results are obtained by employing factorial design values of <b>rotary</b> <b>air</b> preheater for the validation of the calculation data.

50|$|Quadrajet carburetors have {{mechanical}} secondary {{throttle plates}} {{operated by a}} progressive linkage; the primaries open before the secondaries, and use on-demand <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> plates above the secondary throttle plates. The <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> are connected by a cam and linkage to the secondary fuel metering rods. As the airflow increases through the secondary bores, the <b>air</b> <b>valves</b> are pushed down, rotating a cam that lifts the secondary metering rods. The secondary rods are tapered {{in a similar fashion}} to the primary metering rods, effectively increasing the size of the fuel metering holes as the rods are lifted and delivering more fuel. Therefore, the position of the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> will control both fuel and air flow through the secondary venturis, even if the secondary throttle plates are fully opened. Thus the Quadrajet acts like a vacuum-secondary carburetor and only delivers more fuel as it is needed.|$|R
5000|$|The spread-bore four-barrel carburetor, first {{released}} by Rochester in the 1965 model {{year as the}} [...] "Quadrajet" [...] has a much greater spread between the sizes of the primary and secondary throttle bores. The primaries in such a carburetor are quite small relative to conventional four-barrel practice, while the secondaries are quite large. The small primaries aid low-speed fuel economy and driveability, while the large secondaries permit maximum performance when it is called for. To tailor airflow through the secondary Venturis, each of the secondary throats has an <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> at the top. This is configured much like a choke plate, and is lightly spring-loaded into the closed position. The <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> opens progressively in response to engine speed and throttle opening, gradually allowing more air to flow through the secondary side of the carburetor. Typically, the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> is linked to metering rods which are raised as the <b>air</b> <b>valve</b> opens, thereby adjusting secondary fuel flow.|$|R
