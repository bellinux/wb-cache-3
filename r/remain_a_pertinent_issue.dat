The aim of this research was to engage with specific members of the British South Asian Muslim community, that of women and mothers. In undertaking this research aspects of identity, belonging and citizenship were explored, with particular emphasis placed on discourses around ‘identity’. Drawing on narratives expressed in focus groups and interviews this research analysed and explored the influences of higher education in shaping attitudes towards citizenship and belonging. Higher education was revealed to have a positive impact on Muslim women’s’ lives, whilst identities and the notions of ‘Britishness’ were increasingly areas of intense negotiation...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review the role and ability of commissioners to {{implement}} policy and be transformational leaders.

We assessed the degree of this non-linearity for the first time using a recently developed global-scale hydrological model driven by the ERA-Interim Land precipitation reanalysis (1980 – 2010). We introduced new indices to assess large-scale flood hazard, or floodiness, and quantified the link between monthly precipitation, river discharge and floodiness anomalies at the global and regional scales. The results show that monthly floodiness is not well correlated with precipitation, therefore demonstrating the value of hydrometeorological systems for providing floodiness forecasts for decision-makers. A method is described for forecasting floodiness using the Global Flood Awareness System, building a climatology of regional floodiness from which to forecast floodiness anomalies out to two weeks...|$|R

40|$|This article {{introduces}} the Music Therapy Community Clinic’s (MTCC) Music for Health Project based in a tuberculosis (TB) hospital in South Africa. The {{value of this}} community music therapy project is explored from various narrative frameworks pertaining to health and the TB disease. Initially viewed from a reductionist medical narrative with a primary focus on treatment of physical symptoms, music therapy offers patients a diversion from their illness, but is perhaps a luxury rather than an essential form of therapy. The project is then considered from a narrative framework of empowerment, placing TB as a disease that predominantly affects those who are disempowered through poverty, stigmatization and isolation. Three case studies explore how community music therapy serves to empower patients on individual and collective levels, and consider possibilities this may hold for influencing the health behaviour of patients. As TB is becoming <b>a</b> <b>pertinent</b> <b>issue</b> worldwide, the article may offer possibilities {{for the role of}} creative approaches in the care of TB patients. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of whether we are currently in a ‘New Cold War’ or not has been widely debated by the media, politicians, and within the academ-ic field, and as such remains <b>a</b> <b>pertinent</b> <b>issue</b> worthy of exploration. Interactions between the US and Russia over recent years have highlighted some clear tensions within the strained relationship, and the Ukrainian crisis has certainly not helped in dispelling the cold war narrative propa-gated by a new brigade of cold warriors. This perspective, held by authors such as Edward Lucas (2014), views the Russian state as embarking on a quest to regain the power and prestige that the Soviet Union formally held, and perceives Moscow’s foreign policy to be inherently aggressive and an explicit challenge to the current world order. This research however seeks to counter the dominant viewpoint which places the two states within yet another conflictual framework, further perpetuating the destabilisation of their current relations.

40|$|While {{there is}} an {{extensive}} and still growing body of literature on women in academia and the challenges they encounter in career progression, there is little research on their experience specifically within a business school setting. In this study, we attempt to address this gap and examine the experiences and career development of female academics in a business school and how these are impacted by downsizing programmes. To this end, an exploratory case study is conducted. The {{findings of this study}} show that female business school academics experience numerous challenges in terms of promotion and development, networking, and the multiple and conflicting demands placed upon them. As a result, the lack of visibility seems to be <b>a</b> <b>pertinent</b> <b>issue</b> in terms of their career progression. Our data also demonstrates that that, paradoxically, during periods of downsizing women become more visible and thus vulnerable to layoffs {{as a consequence of the}} challenges and pressures created in their environment during this process.

This study aimed {{to estimate the}} volume and main diagnoses of cross-border care in eight European countries, {{in order to provide}} policy makers with background information about the nature of patient mobility in Europe. Methods: This article reports the combined findings from three independent studies that compiled self-reported information on admissions data and main diagnoses from more than 200 hospitals in eight European countries. Results: The average volume of cross-border patients accounted for less than 1 % of total admissions in the hospitals studied here. Diseases of the circulatory system (mainly acute myocardial infarction) and fractures were the most common reasons for hospitalisation of European patients abroad. Deliveries and other diagnoses related to pregnancy, pneumonia, appendicitis and other diseases of the digestive system, aftercare procedures, and disorders of the eye and adnexa were also common diagnoses for this population. Conclusions: Hospitals should reinforce their efforts to adapt the care provided to the needs of foreign patients in treatment areas that cover the most frequent pathologies identified in this populatio...|$|R
