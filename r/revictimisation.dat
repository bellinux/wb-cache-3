50|$|Reasons {{as to why}} <b>revictimisation</b> occurs vary by event type, {{and some}} {{mechanisms}} are unknown. <b>Revictimisation</b> {{in the short term}} is often the result of risk factors that were already present, which were not changed or mitigated after the first victimisation; sometimes the victim cannot control these factors. Examples of these risk factors include living or working in dangerous areas, chaotic familial relations, having an aggressive temperament, drug or alcohol usage and unemployment.|$|E

5000|$|The term <b>revictimisation</b> {{refers to}} a pattern wherein the victim of abuse and/or crime has a {{statistically}} higher tendency to be victimised again, either shortly thereafter or much later in adulthood {{in the case of}} abuse as a child. This latter pattern is particularly notable in cases of sexual abuse. [...] While an exact percentage is almost impossible to obtain, samples from many studies suggest the rate of <b>revictimisation</b> for people with histories of sexual abuse is very high. The vulnerability to victimisation experienced as an adult is also not limited to sexual assault, and may include physical abuse as well.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Revictimisation</b> {{of adults}} who were {{previously}} sexually abused as children is more complex. Multiple theories exist {{as to how}} this functions. Some scientists propose a maladaptive form of learning; the initial abuse teaches inappropriate beliefs and behaviours that persist into adulthood. The victim believes that abusive behaviour is [...] "normal" [...] and comes to expect, or deserve, it from others {{in the context of}} relationships, and thus may unconsciously seek out abusive partners or cling to abusive relationships. Another theory draws on the principle of learned helplessness. As children, they are put in situations that they have little to no hope of escaping, especially when the abuse comes from a caregiver. [...] One theory goes that this state of being unable to fight back or flee the danger leaves the last primitive option: freeze, an offshoot of death-feigning.|$|E
40|$|M. A. The {{purpose of}} this study is to tell the story of sexual <b>revictimisation</b> of {{coloured}} women. The epistemological framework of this study is an integrated one including both modem and postmodern approaches to the study of <b>revictimisation.</b> The dominant postmodern approach is that of constructivism. Both quantitative and qualitative methods of research are used to collect and analyse the data. The story of <b>revictimisation</b> was recounted firstly through responses to a questionnaire by a sample of coloured women within the context of a coloured community. Secondly, the unique stories of sexual <b>revictimisation</b> were re-authored through the co-author's lens in the form of themes that emerged from the stories told by each of the three narrators. The effects of sexual <b>revictimisation,</b> as well as the specific ways each narrator survived their abuse experiences was discussed. Recurring themes evident in the stories of all three narrators were elucidated in a co-constructed story of stories. A comparison between the quantitative research results, the qualitative story constructions and the literature on sexual <b>revictimisation</b> concluded the re-constructed story where the numerous stories, within either a unique, cultural or universal context, were integrated into a conceptual whole. The information gained could serve as guidelines for those working with adult survivors of child sexual abuse within a coloured context. An understanding of sexual <b>revictimisation</b> and the risk factors involved in the effects of child sexual abuse may be useful in the prevention of sexual <b>revictimisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|People {{who have}} been sexually abused as {{children}} are {{two to three times}} more likely to be sexually revictimised in adolescence and/or adulthood. This paper explores the complex array of variables related to sexual <b>revictimisation.</b> Abstract There is a complex array of variables related to sexual <b>revictimisation.</b> Although prevalence is difficult to ascertain, several studies relate that people {{who have been}} sexually abused as children are two to {{three times more likely to}} be sexually revictimised in adolescence and/or adulthood. Much of the literature on sexual <b>revictimisation</b> focuses on the individual risk factors for the victim/survivor - their risk perception and emotional dysregulation resulting from initial sexual victimisation - and how these create vulnerability for sexual <b>revictimisation.</b> Broader contextual factors beyond the victim/survivor, however, are often ignored. These contextual factors are explored here with a particular emphasis on minority groups, such as people with a disability; gay, lesbian and bisexual people; and Indigenous people. This focus demonstrates that individual risk factors often do not account for how perpetrators may target vulnerable people who have previously been victimised, how community and organisational attitudes and norms may support sexual <b>revictimisation,</b> and how broader social norms create vulnerability for certain groups. A focus on these broader contextual factors helps to inform prevention strategies. Key messages 	People who are sexually abused in childhood are two to three times more likely to be sexually revictimised in adolescence and/or adulthood. 	Individual risk factors include a history of child sexual abuse, poor risk perception, emotional dysregulation, cumulative past abuse, family conflict and distress. 	Broader contextual factors, such as perpetrator tactics, community and organisational attitudes, and social norms, are also risk factors for sexual <b>revictimisation.</b> 	Those vulnerable to sexual <b>revictimisation,</b> including minority groups such as people with a disability; gay, lesbian and bisexual people; and Indigenous people may require greater support and advocacy in order to alleviate trauma and trauma symptoms, and increase their resilience. 	Similar strategies used in the sexual violence primary prevention space may be used to prevent sexual <b>revictimisation.</b> This includes respectful relationships education, gender equity principles and a focus on important sites of social norm reproduction, such as sporting sites and the media, to convey messages of respect and equality...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{explores the}} {{contribution}} that traumatic experiences and psychological post-traumatic stress symptoms make to predicting subsequent <b>revictimisation</b> {{in a sample}} of violent crime victims. In addition, the timing of first trauma exposure was also explored. Fifty-four adult victims (27 male and 27 female) of police recorded violent crime were interviewed and their traumatic exposure history, trauma symptomology, age at first trauma exposure as well as psychological and psychosocial functioning were assessed. These victims were followed longitudinally and subsequent <b>revictimisation</b> between six and twelve months post index victimisation measured.

40|$|Background Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) is {{recognised}} as {{a significant}} problem within today's society. The literature has established that individuals who have been sexually abused as children may be at an increased risk for <b>revictimisation</b> throughout their life. The primary {{aim of this study}} was to examine the relationship between CSA and subsequent <b>revictimisation.</b> This investigation included determining if the severity of the CSA affected the rate of <b>revictimisation,</b> if the age of the child during the initial sexual abusive experience affected the rate of <b>revictimisation,</b> and to determine if there is a mediating role between CSA and mental illness. Method The study utilised a prospective design. The forensic medical records of sexually abused children were obtained from the Office of Forensic Medicine (OFM), a state-wide forensic medical service, on children who had been medically confirmed to have experienced sexual abuse (n= 2, 759) between the years 1964 and 1995. These records were linked to the Victorian Police Law Enforcement Assistance Program (LEAP) and the public mental health database (RAPID) for a follow-up period of 44 years. The victims were compared to similarly aged peers obtained randomly from the Australian Electoral Commission (n= 2, 677). Results The individuals from the CSA cohort were more likely (OR = 1. 4, 95 % CI, 1. 26 - 1. 56) to have had contact with the Victorian Police, more likely (OR = 1. 14, 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 27) to be revictimised and more likely (OR = 5. 3, 95 % CI, 3. 79 - 7. 41) to be sexual revictimised than the individuals from the general population. The CSA victims were divided into pre-pubertal (12 yrs.) categories. The pre-pubertal group had significantly more contact (618, 39. 7 %) with the Victorian Police than did the post-pubertal group (382, 31. 8 %) and were significantly more likely to be revictimised in the form of sexual assault and violence. When examining by gender, the males were more likely to be revictimised if they were initially sexually abused post-pubertal (OR = 1. 45, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 2. 07) while the females were more likely (OR = 1. 6, 95 % CI 1. 35 - 1. 92) to be revictimised if they were sexually abused pre-pubertal. No significant difference was observed between the level of severity of the initial abuse and the rate of <b>revictimisation.</b> Almost one quarter (23 %) of the CSA victims had had contact with the public mental system during the course of their lifetime compared to 7. 7 percent from the general population, revealing that victims of CSA were over 3. 5 times more likely to have mental health issues. These mental health issues were observed to have an influence on increasing the level of vulnerability to <b>revictimisation.</b> Rates of alcohol and drug use and self-harm and suicide were all higher within the CSA victim population. Conclusions This study confirmed many of the established relationships already seen between CSA and <b>revictimisation.</b> Mental illness was revealed to be a moderating variable for sexual revictimisation; the victim’s age at the time of the initial sexual abuse played a significant role in the level of vulnerability of revictimisation; and, surprisingly, the level of the severity of the abuse did not have a significant association with the rate of <b>revictimisation.</b> Overall, CSA was shown to play a substantial role in an individual's vulnerability for being subsequently victimised; however, the question remains whether the relationship between CSA and <b>revictimisation</b> is necessarily causal...|$|E
40|$|Victims {{experiencing}} {{the sexual abuse}} are surviving not only physical injustice but above all deep traumas, which very often in different forms, are keeping them company through the entire life. Quite often at establishing different results a sex is underestimated for the perpetrator. Therefore knowing the problem of sexual abuses from a perspective of close as well as distant results {{is very important in}} the event that a woman was a perpetrator of these acts – mother, minder. In the present article based on analysis of literature, a problem of results of the sexual abuse was presented at victims which experienced these behaviours on the part of women. In order to draw up discussing the survived specificity by victims was both of sex of the trauma connected with the sexual application as well as close and distant consequences of these events in the form prime victimisation and <b>revictimisation</b> for figure being noticeable in the adult life of psychosexual disorders and social shortages. Amongst the consequence isolated traumatic factors are deserving the particular attention about dynamic character which are provoking the appearance of many symptoms characteristic of children which experienced the sexual violence. Recalled factors it: traumatic sexualisation of child, the betrayal, the stigmatization and the helplessness. The specificity of these factors results from the fact that they will leave distant “tracks” in the psyche and they can undergo the additional reinforcement if a woman is a perpetrator of the sexual violence. It results from frequent attitudes of “denying” towards the sexual violence applied by women. In the study they pointed also at one of possible consequences of the <b>revictimisation</b> process copying patterns of behaviour connected with the sexual exploitation of children in their more late life by victims is which.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} {{of domestic violence}} is described as pervasive with a majority of victims being females and perpetrators being males. Often females who experienced domestic violence had been previously exposed to family violence during childhood. The aim {{of the study was}} therefore to investigate the perceived childhood exposure to domestic violence as a predisposing factor for <b>revictimisation</b> in adulthood. The study used a quantitative approach with a cross-sectional correlation design. The sample consisted of 77 female participants from shelters across Cape Town, Western Cape. The study employed an adapted version of the Child Exposure to Domestic Violence (CEDV) Scale. The questionnaire was divided into three sections, namely demographic details, types of exposure to domestic violence the adult may have experienced as a child, and current adult experiences of domestic violence. The data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences V 21 (SPSS). Results suggest that there is a significant positive relationship between past perceived experiences of domestic violence and present perceived experiences of domestic violence.

40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests lack of dentist knowledge and uncertainty about how clinical practice {{can be improved}} when dealing with victims of sexual violence. This systematic review presents a synthesis of the available literature, which examined the association between dental fear {{and a history of}} sexual violence victimisation. All studies indicated, to various degrees, that dental fear is associated with a history of sexual violence victimisation. The analysis identified several common themes including a perception of lack of control, avoidance behaviours, experiences of flashbacks, feelings of embarrassment, difficulties with the physical proximity to the dentist, the sex of the dentist reminding patients of the perpetrator, being placed into a horizontal body position, the specific impact of fellatio, the smell of latex, experienced lack of knowledge of dental professionals leading to insensitive treatment as well as <b>revictimisation</b> experiences, and the occurrence of disproportionate dental problems among patients who had experienced event(s) of sexual violence. All these themes are discussed in detail. Specific strategies are offered to assist dental practitioners in providing sensitive treatment for patients with a history of sexual violence.

40|$|Drawing on the South Australia Juvenile Justice (SAJJ) project dataset, {{this article}} {{analyses}} youth peer violence ('punch-ups') {{with a focus on}} girl-on-girl assaults. My aim is to address and explain significant gaps in the empirical knowledge of gender and restorative justice, and in the aspirations and reality of restorative justice itself. Four points are made. First, of all the offence categories, the male and female punch-ups showed the least degree of offender remorse, positive movement between offender and victim, and victim satisfaction; and they showed the greatest degree of victim <b>revictimisation</b> and more negative outcomes of the conference process. This occurs because offenders may 'admit' to offending, but deny that their actions are wrong. Second, simple gender comparisons of offender and victim orientations in a restorative process are likely to produce misleading results, unless they are keyed to particular offence categories. Third, for girls' punch-ups, the status of 'victim' and 'offender' is contested, with both protagonists seeing themselves as 'victims' (or as 'nonoffenders'). Fourth, although some offending girls say their violence is justified, their female victims are hurt and traumatized, some with significant long-term effects. Implications are drawn for feminist analyses of girls' violence and for ethical practices of restorative justice.

40|$|This {{study was}} an {{investigation}} of the additional risk conferred by the experience of psychogenic amnesia for memories of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) on the likelihood of becoming a victim of sexual assault in later life. A total of 210 community respondents completed a retrospective web-based trauma survey. The majority of respondents were female (74. 3 %) and their ages ranged from 16 to 65 years, {{with a mean age of}} 33 years. Chi-squared analysis revealed that survivors of CSA demonstrated signiﬁcantly greater risk (58 %, x 2 ¼ 44. 461, p¼ 0. 0005) of experiencing sexual assault in adolescence in comparison with their non-abused counterparts (13 %). Furthermore, survivors who reported having been amnesic for their abuse-related memories demonstrated a higher rate of adolescent <b>revictimisation</b> (86 %) than survivors who had retained continuous memories of their victimisation (48 %, x 2 ¼ 8. 626, p¼ 0. 003). Overall, once-amnesic survivors of CSA demonstrated 6. 6 times the risk of sexual assault and an eight-fold risk for rape during adolescence in comparison with their non-abused counterparts. It is proposed that the elevated risk conferred by amnesia for CSA might be mediated by two distinct pathways, both of which are associated with the use of dissociation as a defence mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Research {{suggests}} that engagement with support services after criminal victimisation is low. With this in mind, {{this study investigated}} predictors of engagement with Victim Support, {{in a sample of}} victims of violent crime. All violent crimes recorded by Lancashire Constabulary for two postcode areas (PR 1 and PR 2), who were referred to Victim Support (Preston) between April 2013 and September 2013 (n= 869) were assessed, with a follow-up undertaken in 2014. Two percent of victims booked or attended a face-to-face meeting with Victim Support, and just over one fifth engaged over the telephone on at least one occasion across a range of support options at the initial data collection point. Engagement with Victim Support was not significantly related to future victimisation. When <b>revictimisation</b> since the first data collection period was inspected against demographic and crime-related variables, previous victimisation, regardless of the type of crime experienced, was the strongest predictor of being victimised again. This was despite the fact that such victims {{were more likely to be}} identified as high risk, and actively engaged with Victim Support at the initial time of victimisation. Suggestions for further research are made in light of the changes generally to victim services in the UK...|$|E
40|$|Victims {{of human}} {{trafficking}} {{should be protected}} to prevent their <b>revictimisation.</b> This article compares the way the United Kingdom (UK) and Italy protect victims of human trafficking. The reason for this comparison is because the UK {{does not have any}} specific law that grants a residence permit to victims of human trafficking. The only way victims could be protected in the UK is when they can demonstrate their rights under the Refugee Convention or the European Convention on Human Rights. In contrast, Italian law establishes the issue of a residence permit to victims of human trafficking. Unfortunately, rarely this law is applied and often victims are confused with other irregular migrants and criminals and expelled. In an Italian city called Rimini, Italian law has been adequately applied and the phenomenon of trafficking in human beings has been completely defeated. In the article, the Rimini Method is described. Moreover, the findings of interviews held in Rimini {{with the head of the}} Italian Police in Rimini and with the responsible of an anti-trafficking organization which supported the Police in Rimini are shown, with the aim to explain how trafficking in human beings in Rimini has been defeated. Finally, this article argues that the UK should follow this example and a first step to protect victims of human trafficking should be, as the British Joint Committee on Human Rights highlighted, to sign and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Actions against Trafficking in Human Beings...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Research {{has shown}} that sexual trauma {{represents}} a specific threat for psychosis, particularly among females. Sexual trauma among females, however, {{has also been shown}} to enhance the risk for further <b>revictimisation.</b> Females are likely to exhibit distinct lifetime trauma profiles, i. e. female sexual trauma victims are often more likely to experience particular forms of re-victimisation, such as intimate partner and domestic violence. Methods: This study used data from the Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (2007) to profile lifetime histories of sexual trauma and domestic violence among female participants (N = 4, 111). Results: The latent class analysis revealed four lifetime victimisation classes: (i) a multiple victimisation class; (ii) an intimate partner victimisation class; (iii) a sexual victimisation class; and (iv) a victimisation-free class. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that there was a strong association between class membership and a diagnosis of psychosis and that the victimisation classes were significantly associated with all psychotic-like experiences. Compared to the victimisation-free class, the multiple victimisation class displayed an increased likelihood of experiencing all psychotic experiences except mania. The intimate partner victimisation class was also associated with an increased likelihood of experiencing all psychotic experiences; however, the odds ratios for this class were lower than those recorded for the multiple victimisation class. Conclusions: These findings reflect female-specific variation in both victimisation history and psychosis-related vulnerability. Acknowledging such sex-specific variation may advance our understanding of the complex associations that continue to emerge between trauma and psychosis for both males and females...|$|E
40|$|Background: Prior {{research}} {{endorsed the}} establishment of sexual assault centres in the Netherlands {{because of the potential}} benefit for victims ’ mental recovery. In 2012, the first Dutch sexual assault centre was founded at the University Medical Center Utrecht. The aim of the centre is to provide 24 / 7 coordinated and integrated services (i. e., medical, forensic, and psychological) in one location. Objective: The {{purpose of the present study}} was to describe demographic, background, and assault characteristics of victims seen at the centre within one week post-assault, and their use of post-assault services in order to improve current services. Method: From January 2012 to September 2013, prospective data of 108 patients were collected. To describe the population included, frequency counts and proportions were generated for categorical variables. Results: The mean age was 21. 3 years (SD 9. 8). Most victims were female (91. 7 %). A large proportion of victims reported background characteristics known to increase the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and <b>revictimisation</b> such as prior sexual abuse (32. 4 %), pre-existing use of mental health services (45. 4 %), and not living with both biological parents (61. 7 %). Most patients (88. 9 %) consulted the centre within 72 hours post-assault.

40|$|This {{paper has}} been {{inspired}} by the processes of preparing for ethical scrutiny and seeking ethical approval {{for a series of}} studies examining causal mechanisms that might facilitate sexual <b>revictimisation.</b> The focus here is on just four of the issues that arose {{in the context of the}} first study: a web-based survey. One of the aims of the survey is to test whether victims of child sexual abuse who experienced a period of psychogenic or dissociative amnesia demonstrate an exaggerated risk for adolescent/adult sexual assault during this amnesic phase. That is, cases where survivors report ‘suddenly remembering’ in adulthood that they were abused as children, but state that prior to this ‘remembering’ they had no prior knowledge of their abuse. The study design is considered to be the first ethical issue. To enhance the methodological robustness a strategy has been employed to reduce the erroneous inclusion of currently amnesic participants in the non-abused comparison group. Secondly, consideration is given to the likely harms and benefits that might be incurred or bestowed upon the participants. Thirdly, problems of both re-traumatisation and vicarious traumatisation in relation to the researcher are contemplated and juxtaposed against the possibility of the facilitation of post-traumatic growth and a personal shift towards wisdom and generativity. Finally, the survey title was originally criticised as negating ‘fully’ informed consent and a defence is therefore offered that ultimately gained ethical approval. It is hoped that these deliberations and insights may prove useful to others in planning their own research and ethics proposals...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{indicated}} an association between childhood sexual abuse (CSA) and {{an increased risk of}} engaging in unsafe behaviours during adulthood, including risky sexual practices. This study examined the relationship between CSA and adult HIV sexual risk behaviour among a sample of South African {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM). Potential pathological long-term mental health outcomes of CSA, including dissociation, sex-related substance abuse, depression, sexual compulsivity, impaired interpersonal communication, and over-reliance on submissive sexual scripts, were treated as variables mediating the relationship between CSA and sexual risk behaviour. Men frequenting a gay internet dating site were randomly selected to complete an electronic version of the anonymous survey. Results indicate that one-fourth of participants reported a history of CSA. Men with a history of unwanted sexual activity during childhood were more likely to report recreational substance abuse, sex-related substance abuse, sexual compulsivity, and adult <b>revictimisation</b> experiences. Men who were abused were also more likely to engage in unprotected anal intercourse compared to those who were not abused. Mediation analyses revealed that MSM who are survivors of CSA are particularly susceptible to drug abuse, sex-related drug abuse, and sexual compulsivity, and these sequelae in turn predict higher reported numbers of male sexual partners. The current data suggest that CSA is widespread among men at high risk for HIV infection, and that it may have a devastating influence on the quality of life and health risk behaviour of these men. These results also highlight the importance of mental health services and new approaches in HIV prevention for MSM who have been sexually abused as children. Further research is needed into the contextual factors of the childhood abuse experience which account for the variability in longterm negative mental health outcomes of CSA survivor...|$|E
40|$|When the {{restorative}} justice idea is implemented, its goals and values {{might not be}} entirely pursued clue to {{various factors such as}} penal goals, relevant social theories, cultural difference, and the values and norms of people in society.

Moreover, empirical evidence relating to the effect of {{restorative justice}} practices on crime victims is not consistent and casts doubt on its reliability and validity. These limitations snake it uncertain that restorative justice practices can restore victims. Therefore, this research study aims to investigate the actual effect by systematically analysing quantitative and qualitative findings of the existing studies conducted in various countries, compare the effect between different restorative justice practices. i. e. conferencing and mediation and the conventional criminal justice system: and investigate factors relating, to the effect. i. e., case characteristics, scheme characteristics and study characteristics. The meta-analytical method is used to analyse research findings collected from 17 restorative justice schemes implemented in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, United States and United Kingdom. Results from the meta-analysis confirm that comer acing and mediation {{have a profound effect on}} the outcomes of victim satisfaction, perception of fairness, fear of <b>revictimisation,</b> attitude toward offenders, agreement completion, and receiving of an apology. The effect ranges from 2 to 12 times as opposed to the conventional justice system with the highest on the outcome of the receiving of an apology and the lowest on the outcome of the perception of fairness. Two outcomes are examined further and results show that restorative justice practices are likely to increase victim satisfaction and perception of fairness among victims of serious cases more so than among victims of less serious cases. In addition, they are likely to increase victim satisfaction and perception of fairness on victim's attitude toward the way their cases were handled than the case outcomes. These findings confirm the importance of the restorative process and suggest that restorative justice schemes should put more emphasis on serious cases.

40|$|Violence {{directed}} toward the self and others continues to manifest as a profound human problem, despite concerted amelioration efforts. Effective redress is hampered by taboos and underreporting, particularly in relation to sexual and familial violence and mental illness. Major objectives of the current research were to devise an inclusive, nonthreatening methodology to facilitate disclosure and circumvent previous research shortcomings, to achieve representation from underresearched and marginalised cohorts; derive comprehensive data to measure sexual abuse impact and sequelae; and examine victim offence-related perceptions and attributions, offending patterns, and relationships between sexual victimisation and suicidal ideation and behaviour. Quantitative and qualitative data were derived from 2503 Australian males and females, aged 16 - 83 years, using a nationwide online survey. Extensive {{analyses were conducted to}} differentiate victims and nonvictims of child and adult sexual abuse; and nonsuicidal individuals from those reporting past suicidality. Comparative examination encompassed domains such as gender, assault-related attributions and cognitions, psychosocial wellbeing, trauma symptomology, and police-reporting. Multivariate analyses were conducted to identify and examine perpetrator modus operandi; offence typology and impact; victim reactions, perceptions, and attributions; and suicidal ideation and behaviours. Current psychopathology was strongly associated with sexual abuse and suicidality histories. Heightened perturbation and suicidality were associated with childhood abuse and adult <b>revictimisation.</b> Males exhibited greater nondisclosure and help-seeking reticence than females, yet similar post-abuse psychopathology. Victims experienced multiple reporting barriers and frequent suboptimal reactions upon disclosure. Few perpetrators were reported. Suicidality history was significantly more present amongst victims of both childhood and adulthood sexual abuse. Sociopolitical, judicial, clinical, and social change implications are discussed emphasising needs for deconstructing silence, fostering help-seeking, nonthreatening methodologies, primary prevention initiatives, and strengthened client-centred responses toward mental illness and victims and perpetrators of violence. Importance of fostering greater discourse and disclosure through broader social acceptance, inclusive practices, and responsive, strengths-based initiatives to address mental illness, suicidality, and offence-precipitating factors are addressed. The need to better suicidality detection and intervention through targeted and strategic change processes is emphasised...|$|E
40|$|Background: Violence in {{childhood}} {{is associated with}} mental health problems and risk of <b>revictimisation.</b> Less {{is known about the}} relative importance of the various types of childhood and adult victimisation for adult mental health. Objective: To estimate the associations between various types of childhood and adult violence exposure, and their combined associations to adult mental health. Method: This study was a cross-sectional telephone survey of the Norwegian adult population; 2, 435 women and 2, 092 men aged 18 – 75 participated (19. 3 % of those we tried to call and 42. 9 % of those who answered the phone). The interview comprised a broad array of violence exposure in both childhood and adulthood. Anxiety/depression was measured by the Hopkins Symptom Check List (HSCL- 10). Results: Victimisation was commonly reported, for example, child sexual abuse (women: 10. 2 %, men: 3. 5 %), childhood–parental physical violence (women: 4. 9 %, men: 5. 1 %), and lifetime forcible rape (women: 9. 4 %, men: 1. 1 %). All categories of childhood violence were significantly associated with adult victimisation, with a 2. 2 – 5. 0 times higher occurrence in exposed children (p< 0. 05 for all associations). Anxiety/depression (HSCL- 10) associated with adult abuse increased with the number of childhood violence categories experienced (p< 0. 001). All combinations of childhood violence were significantly associated with anxiety/depression (p< 0. 001 for all associations). Individuals reporting psychological violence/neglect had the highest levels of anxiety/depression. Conclusions: Results should be interpreted in light of the low response rate. Childhood violence in all its forms was a risk factor for victimisation in adulthood. Adult anxiety/depression was associated with both the number of violence categories and the type of childhood violence experienced. A broad assessment of childhood and adult violence exposure is necessary both for research and prevention purposes. Psychological violence and neglect should receive more research attention, especially in combination with other types of violence...|$|E
40|$|To date {{there has}} been little Australian {{research}} on repeat victimisation. This is a study of repeat burglary in an area of Brisbane using police calls for service data. We demonstrate: (a) the prevalence of residential repeat victim addresses (‘hot dots’) is of a similar magnitude to that found in studies in the United Kingdom; (b) the time distributions of <b>revictimisation</b> are identical with those found in studies in the UK and elsewhere; (c) ‘hot spots ’ (small areas with high crime density) can be identified by statistical analyses of spatial concentrations of incidents; (d) unstable hot spots tend to be temporary aggregations of hot dots, whereas stable hot spots seem to reflect more the social and physical characteristics of certain localities; and (e) the overall incidence of burglary could be reduced by at least 25 per cent if all repeat victimisation could be eliminated. There are a number of areas where concepts and techniques for repeat victim research could potentially be strengthened: (a) clarifying the connections between hot dots and hot spots, particularly through exploration of the concept of a ‘near repeat address’; (b) applying survival analysis to the data on the time periods between victimisations; and (c) using moving average techniques to examine changes in the spatial distributions of burglary over time. Burglary has been a growing problem, both in Queensland and in Australia as a whole, for the past 20 years, although police statistics and crime victim surveys indicate that the Queensland rate is close to the national average (Criminal Justice Commission, 1996). However, there are indications that the rate may have peaked, with recent marked declines in the burglary rate in Queensland (Queensland Police Service, 1998). If Australia follows the US trends, this recent decline may presage a long term and substantial decline in the incidence of burglary (Decker, 1998; Langan & Farrington, 1998). Nevertheless, as Decker points out, even in the The {{authors would like to thank}} the Queensland Police Service (Chief Superintendent Doug Smith, South Eastern Region), the Beenleigh Police Division in particular for all their invaluable assistance in this study, the Criminal Justice Commission (particularly Dr Davi...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: This study {{concerns}} resilience {{related to}} juvenile delinquency among {{victims of sexual}} abuse: sexual abuse has been recognized as a powerful risk factor {{for the emergence of}} deviant and criminal behavior. Objective: Our study aims to explore and highlight the protective factors that prevent victims of sexual abuse from engaging in a delinquent trajectory. Method: The sample consists of teenage girls who have revealed at minimum last year, their intergenerational abuse. These girls, all between 12 and 18 years old, are divided into sub-groups: the non-offender victims and the victims who are also offenders. Each teenage victim is compared to a normative population on different psychological functioning dimensions : self-esteem (Harter's self-perception profile for adolescents), aggressiveness (the Buss-Perry Aggression questionnaire) and Post-Traumatic Stress, with the Impact of Event scale-Revised, (IES-R) -Horowitz. We analyze family characteristics such as familial attachment and family climate, social characteristics such as associations with peers, and environmental factors such as reactions to revelations of sexual abuse, the presence of family and extra-familial resources, psychological care. Results and conclusion: The results show that teenage victims of sexual assault present lower self-esteem and a negative self-perception in all fields, except for the perception of their attractiveness. Over-investment of this single dimension of self-perception can lead to a sexualization of their relationships with others and expose them to the risk of sexual <b>revictimisation.</b> The comparative analyses between the adolescent delinquent and non-delinquent victims highlight risk factors in connection with setting them off on a delinquent trajectory and protective factors supporting their resilience. The results highlight specific characteristics to the offender juvenile victims supporting a delinquent trajectory : aggressiveness, PTSD, defensive strategy of avoidance and characteristics of abuse (chronicity of abuse). The victim committed in delinquent trajectories presented more aggressiveness, consumeristic behaviour, post-traumatic stress and defensive strategy of avoidance than non-offender victims. Delinquent behaviour, just like substance abuse, could be a strategy of risk avoidance in connection with reliving sexual trauma, which hinders the process of resilience. Compared to the process of resilience, immediate and differed paternal support (during and after the revelations) seems the most important factor of protection. Being able to benefit from psychological councelling and having an extra-familial resource (a significant relationship with someone in the social environment) also constitute factors that support the resilience of these teenagers and prevent them from going down the path of delinquency. The interventions should aim at establishing a therapeutic alliance with these young girls during the early process of revealing the sexual abuse and mobilize and activate the support of the father (when he is not the abuser) or of a meaningful paternal figure as early as possible during the revealing phase and to accompany him in this restructuring function.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} beliefs and behaviour of individuals who have suffered a traumatic experience, specifically the violent crimes of assault, motor vehicle hijackings and armed robbery. The researcher focuses on the occurrence of residual, subclinical symptoms of PTSD that individuals experience subsequent to the specified violent crimes. By identifying and describing trends in commonalities that exist between research participants’ accounts of such residual, subclinical symptoms the research aims to explore and describe these trends, enabling a common understanding and awareness of the longstanding effects that these experiences have on individuals. The qualitative research design allowed for an exploration aimed at understanding the meaning that individuals ascribe to specific events. Three case studies were examined. The researcher ensured the exclusion of individuals who met the criteria for PTSD by making use of the PCL-S. From this approach a thematic analysis was done using the transcriptions of audiotaped interviews with the participants. The three participants chosen for the study were aged twenty-nine (29), thirty (30) and thirty-one (31) independently. Two of the participants experienced an armed robbery, which were, independently, followed by non-violent crime of housebreaking and theft. A third participant experienced an armed robbery during her early childhood, and an additional crime of aggravated robbery in adulthood. The studied violent crimes had taken place between one year eleven months and six years prior to this study. None of the participants have received therapy following their traumatic experience. Five important findings were identified and discussed. Firstly, some individuals still meet the requirements for a diagnosis of PTSD, even years following their experiences with traumatic events. Secondly, following {{the experience of a}} violent crime some individual’s core cognitive schemas regarding themselves, their world and their relationships undergo various changes. Thirdly, some individuals experience numerous posttraumatic symptoms, which are not extensive enough to validate the diagnosis of PTSD, but that affect the individual’s life on a regular basis. Nine symptoms were identified in this study. Fourthly, some individuals may experience additional effects following exposure to violent crimes, e. g. physical illness, that is not classified as posttraumatic symptoms. Fifthly, a few individuals who have been the victim of more than one crime may experience cumulative or diminished effects when one explores the overall effects of <b>revictimisation.</b> Results also indicated that individuals may experiences similar posttraumatic symptoms, but that the presentation of these symptoms are unique and are influenced by an individual’s history, cognitive schemas and the characteristics of the crimes that they have experienced. Finally, these findings explored and described the phenomenon of partial posttraumatic stress disorder in order to expand the understanding of this occurrence.

40|$|There {{is a high}} {{prevalence}} {{of child sexual abuse}} (CSA) in India and the UK (Laccino, 2014). However, {{there is a lack of}} research on culturally-specific aspects of psychotherapy offered to child and adolescent survivors of CSA in both these countries. Therapeutic interventions with sexually abused children raise complex concerns due to the heterogeneity based on the developmental stage of children; varied impact, presenting difficulties and needs; and characteristics of abuse, age, gender, ethnicity and cultural factors. Numerous therapeutic interventions for CSA have been documented, with varying theoretical constructs, structure, content and outcome (Reavey & Warner, 2001), ranging from cognitive behavioural, psychoanalytic, humanistic and feminist paradigm (Misurell, Springer, & Tryon, 2011). Most of these approaches do not provide sufficient guides to therapy (Reavey & Warner, 2001). Few of these are widely studied and clinically accepted, while most lack empirical evidence. Although existing studies conclude that therapy is better than no treatment, there is lack of consensus on treatment characteristics important in child and adolescent sexual abuse therapy (Hetzel-Riggin, Brausch, & Montgomery, 2007). Further, little is known about culturally-specific holistic and coherent responses to CSA. A Constructivist Grounded Theory (Charmaz, 2006) study was conducted to investigate therapeutic approaches practiced by professionals in India and the UK with child and adolescent survivors of CSA, and to understand the factors that govern the choice of an approach or model adopted. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 32 professionals (16 each in India and the UK) from different settings including statutory, voluntary and private sector. NVIVO 10 was used for data management and analysis of the digitally recorded and transcribed interviews. Although there is a growing emphasis on evidence-based therapies, with most empirical studies focussing on traditional forms of psychotherapy, the actual practice of the professionals interviewed reflected a more fluid, flexible, multi-modal, ecological and integrative approach to CSA-therapy. The findings indicate that the therapeutic interventions progress through four different phases, based on the goals identified by professionals. The goals in turn are influenced by the socio-cultural context, structural factors, and/or trauma understanding of the professionals. Four phases identified in the study are: 1. Social Action Framework, with the goal to identify silenced and invisible children, particularly in a culture of silence and suppression in India; 2. Stabilisation and Resilience Building Framework, found to be practiced in India and the UK, with the goal to ensure safety and build the foundation for ensuing phase of therapy; 3. CSA-Trauma Resolution Framework, where the goal is to uncover the sexual abuse details to facilitate recovery and reintegrate the traumatised child, more visible in therapeutic practice in the UK; and 4. Maintenance and Relapse Prevention Framework, with the goal to prevent relapse and protect from <b>revictimisation</b> and future developmental difficulties. These phases may be mutually exclusive, follow a linear trajectory, or there may be a back and forth movement from one phase to the other. These four phases were integrated to construct a culturally relevant, ecological-based theoretical model of CSA therapy with child and adolescent survivors...|$|E
