The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the intensity and correlation of the osteoporotic changes in the bone density of the skeleton and body mass index (BMI) with a reduction in edentulous mandibles, and to assess possibility of reparation of layers of mandibles with increase of mineral content in jaws of patients affected by osteoporosis. Material and Methods. In this study, 99 edentulous patients with decreased bone density comprised the experimental group, and 48 edentulous patients with normal bone densities formed the control. The age of the examined patients was 69. 02 ± 7, 9, range 53 – 74 of females and 69. 11 ± 7. 1, range 59 – 76 years. Radiographs of the hands and panoramic radiographs were done for all the patients. The values of BMI, metacarpal index, density of lumbar spine (L 2 –L 4), in the phalanx and in segments of the mandibles as well as the edentulous alveolar <b>ridges</b> <b>heights</b> were measured, assessed and calculated.

These experiments are used to develop a parameterization of the horizontal fluxes over tillage ridged surfaces based only on the geometric characteristics of the ridges. Indeed, the key parameters controlling the horizontal flux, namely the friction velocity, threshold friction velocity and the adjustment coefficient, are derived through specific expressions, from <b>ridge</b> <b>heights</b> (RH) and <b>ridge</b> spacing (RS).

Moreover, the effect of ridges in trapping particles contributes for more than 90 % in the flux reduction while the ridge roughness effect is weak and decreases when the wind velocity increases...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the strength of the marginal ridge of tunnel preparations with different marginal ridge heights, using different restorative materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 120 sound premolars were randomly divided into three groups of standardized tunnel preparations with a remaining marginal <b>ridge</b> <b>height</b> of 1. 5 mm, 2. 5 mm and 3. 5 mm, respectively. In each tunnel group, 10 teeth were filled with all four newly developed adhesive materials that had not previously been used in tunnel preparation: Ketac Aplicap, Fuji IX, Fuji II LC and Beautifil Flow F 02. The control group comprised 10 sound teeth. All teeth were subjected to incremental dynamic force testing. Remaining marginal <b>ridge</b> <b>height</b> and restoration material were the independent variables. The mean maximum energy (MEI) score was the dependent variable. Data were analyzed, using one- and two-way analysis of variance. Scheffe's test and Student's t-test were used for comparison between groups. RESULTS: Both restorative material (P< 0. 0001) and remaining marginal <b>ridge</b> <b>height</b> (P< 0. 0001) had a statistically significant effect on the mean MEI score of tunnel-prepared teeth. At the 2. 5 mm of remaining marginal <b>ridge</b> <b>height,</b> no statistically significant difference in mean MEI score existed between Beautifil Flow F 02 -filled tunnel-prepared teeth and sound teeth.

30|$|Finally, {{the design}} {{parameters}} (namely <b>ridge</b> <b>height,</b> ridge clearance, ridge nose radius, ridge shoulder radius, ridge-to-punch nose distance, {{and number of}} ridges) were specified for the microridge punch. An excessively high <b>ridge</b> <b>height</b> induces the ridges to be deeply pressed into the blank, whereas an extremely low <b>ridge</b> <b>height</b> causes the ridges to generate unsatisfactory drawing effects. Moreover, an extremely high ridge clearance results in the excessive distribution of the ridge drawing force to the blank. The minimum ridge clearance {{is limited to the}} thickness of the grinding blade. An extremely long ridge nose radius reduces the drawing force of the ridges; however, an excessively short ridge nose radius causes the ridge to be deeply pressed into the blank. In addition, an excessively long ridge shoulder radius induces the ridges to deliver limited drawing force. The minimum ridge shoulder radius is limited to the nasal fillet radius of the grinding blade. An extremely long ridge-to-punch nose distance results in increased thickness difference percentages, whereas an excessively short ridge-to-punch nose distance leads to changes in the appearance of components. In addition, an extremely high number of ridges increases the punch manufacturing costs, whereas an extremely low number of ridges reduces the drawing effect.|$|E
