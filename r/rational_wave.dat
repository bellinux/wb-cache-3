40|$|The {{construction}} of driven piles on rock has been practiced {{for years in}} Hong Kong.

The load transfer mechanism and the pile performance are studied based on comprehensive pile tests. Analyses show that the pile design is controlled by the structural capacity of the pile section but not the engineering properties of the bedrock. The pile toe resistance back-calculated from strain gauges is found to be considerably higher than the allowable values for bored pile design. The Hiley formula commonly used in Hong Kong is found to underestimate the ultimate pile capacity of the pile founded on rock.

The nonlocal symmetries of the reduced Maxwell-Bloch equations are {{obtained by the}} truncated Painleve expansion approach and the Mobious invariant property. The nonlocal symmetries are localized to a prolonged system by introducing suitable auxiliary dependent variables. The extended system can be closed and a novel Lie point symmetry system is constructed.

The mixed {{nonlinear}} Schrödinger (MNLS) {{equation is}} {{a model for the}} propagation of the Alfvén wave in plasmas and the ultrashort light pulse in optical fibers with two nonlinear effects of self-steepening and self phase-modulation(SPM), which is also the first non-trivial flow of the integrable Wadati-Konno-Ichikawa(WKI) system. The determinant representation Tn of a n-fold Darboux transformation(DT) for the MNLS equation is presented. The smoothness of the solution q[2 k] generated by T 2 k is proved for the two cases (non-degeneration and double-degeneration) through the iteration and determinant representation. Starting from a periodic seed(plane <b>wave),</b> <b>rational</b> solutions with two parameters a and b of the MNLS equation are constructed by the DT and the Taylor expansion.

40|$|In this work, {{we study}} the {{dynamics}} of rogue waves in the partially PT-symmetric nonlocal Davey-Stewartson(DS) systems. Using the Darboux transformation method, general rogue waves in the partially PT-symmetric nonlocal DS equations are derived. For the partially PT-symmetric nonlocal DS-I equation, the solutions are obtained and expressed in term of determinants. For the partially PT-symmetric DS-II equation, the solutions are represented as quasi-Gram determinants. It is shown that the fundamental rogue waves in these two systems are rational solutions which arises from a constant background at t→ -∞, and develops finite-time singularity on an entire hyperbola in the spatial plane at the critical time. It is also shown that the interaction of several fundamental rogue waves is described by the multi rogue waves.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose an {{extended}} Kundu-Eckhaus equation (KEE) for modeling the dynamics of skewed rogue waves emerging {{in the vicinity of}} a wave blocking point due to opposing current. The equation we propose is a KEE with an additional potential term therefore the results presented in this paper can easily be generalized to study the quantum tunneling properties of the rogue waves and ultrashort (femtosecond) pulses of the KEE. In the frame of the extended KEE, we numerically show that the chaotic perturbations of the ocean current trigger the occurrence of the rogue waves on the ocean surface. We propose and implement a split-step scheme and show that the extended KEE that we propose is unstable against random chaotic perturbations in the current profile. These perturbations transform the monochromatic wave field into a chaotic sea state with many peaks. We numerically show that the shapes of rogue waves due to perturbations in the current profile closely follow the form of <b>rational</b> rogue <b>wave</b> solutions, especially for the central peak.

40|$|In {{this study}} we discuss the shapes and {{statistics}} of the rogue (freak) waves emerging due to wave-current interactions. With this purpose, we use a simple governing equation which is a nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) extended by R. Smith (1976). This extended NLSE accounts {{for the effects of}} current gradient on the nonlinear dynamics of the ocean surface near blocking point. Using a split-step scheme we show that the extended NLSE of Smith is unstable against random chaotic perturbation in the current profile. Therefore the monochromatic wave field with unit amplitude turns into a chaotic sea state with many peaks. By comparing the numerical and analytical results, we show that rogue waves due to perturbations in the current profile are in the form of <b>rational</b> rogue <b>wave</b> solutions of the NLSE. We also discuss the effects of magnitude of the chaotic current profile perturbations on the statistics of the rogue wave generation at the ocean surface. The extension term in Smith's extended NLSE causes phase shifts and it does not change the total energy level of the wave field. Using the methodology adopted in this study, the dynamics of rogue wave occurrence on the ocean surface due to blocking effect of currents can be studied. This enhances the safety of the offshore operations and ocean travel. Publisher's Versio...|$|R

40|$|<b>Rational</b> {{assessment}} of <b>wave</b> loads for ultimate strength of ship structures requires appropriate numerical tools capable {{of dealing with}} physical phenomena related to severe environmental conditions. In addition to low frequency wave loads, vibration caused by wave action adds to the total wave loading of the primary hull structure. The thesis presents a numerical method for determining ship hull structural loads due to the action of waves, including the contributions from vibration of the fundamental vertical vibration modes of the hull. The proposed numerical method {{is based on a}} coupled numerical solution of the dynamics of fluid and structure. The fluid dynamics method is based on solution of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations combined with a multiphase fluid formulation, whereas the structural dynamics method relies on a simplified representation of the hull girder with a finite element beam. The fluid dynamics method is in principle well suited to capture nonlinear flow features relevant for time domain simulation of ships in severe or extreme environments due to the capability of capturing complex flows including highly disturbed free surfaces. Wave-wave interaction, wave breaking and wave impacts are implicitly accounted for. The coupled method presented here implicitly and consistently accounts for complex resonant excitation of hull girder vibrations in waves as well as impulsive vibratory excitation due to slamming. Fundamental tasks of the work documented herein are the improvement and validation of the coupled numerical method, including investigations of required computational accuracy and estimations of numerical uncertainties.
