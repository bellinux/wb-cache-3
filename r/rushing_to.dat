5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles. In most mammals, the walls of the veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear to actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action. Due to their relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of blood flow <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> their heads when roosting.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rushing</b> <b>to</b> assist Murakumo, Asagumo and Natsugumo were {{attacked}} by another group of 11 CAF SBDs and TBFs escorted by 12 fighters at 15:45. An SBD placed its bomb almost directly amidships on Natsugumo while two more near misses contributed to her severe damage. After Asagumo took off her survivors, Natsugumo sank at 16:27. The CAF aircraft also scored several more hits on the stationary Murakumo, setting her afire. After her crew abandoned ship, Shirayuki scuttled her with a torpedo, picked up her survivors, and joined {{the rest of the}} Japanese warships for the remainder of their return trip to the Shortland Islands.|$|E

5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies (10-3), led by redshirt {{freshman}} running back Ryan Williams and Junior Quarterback Tyrod Taylor, met in Atlanta with the Tennessee Volunteers (7-6) at the Georgia Dome {{to end their}} season right where it had begun against Alabama, who would win the National Championship a week later. Williams, who had only moved to number 1 on the depth charts when Darren Evans was injured in the offseason, was looking for 109 yards <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> pass Kevin Jones’ school-record of 1,647 set in 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{teams were}} as evenly matched {{in the third}} quarter as they had been in the first, with Vanderbilt gaining only two first downs. Soon after the start of the fourth quarter Neely intercepted a pass, weaving for a 25-yeard return to Georgia's 40-yard line. Two long pass {{attempts}} failed, and Thomas Ryan lined up to punt. Rupert Smith sneaked in behind Ryan, <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> recover the 25-yard onside kick from scrimmage. Smith jumped up to get the ball from a horde of Bulldogs after they let it bounce, and raced for a 15-yard touchdown. After he added an extra point, the game ended in a 7–7 tie.|$|E

He fired several more shots into the cellar before <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> {{the head of the}} cellar stairs. By thus cutting off any means of escape, a further thirty Germans were taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|George's mother, the Electress Sophia, died on 28 May 1714 {{at the age}} of 83. She had {{collapsed}} in the gardens at Herrenhausen after <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> shelter from a shower of rain. George was now Queen Anne's direct heir. He swiftly revised the membership of the Regency Council that would take power after Anne's death, as it was known that Anne's health was failing and politicians in Britain were jostling for power. She suffered a stroke, which left her unable to speak, and died on 1 August 1714. The list of regents was opened, the members sworn in, and George was proclaimed King of Great Britain and Ireland. Partly due to contrary winds, which kept him in The Hague awaiting passage, he did not arrive in Britain until 18 September. George was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 20 October. His coronation was accompanied by rioting in over twenty towns in England.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February 1934, Whittle {{was walking}} through University Park {{when he was}} accosted by a small boy who said that his younger brother {{had fallen into the}} lake. <b>Rushing</b> <b>to</b> the area, Whittle dived into the weed-choked lake and began searching for the boy. Finding him unconscious, Whittle brought the boy to the bank and applied {{artificial}} respiration for approximately half an hour; the child later came around and was taken to hospital. Whittle left the scene and proceeded home in a taxi without leaving his name, but his identity was subsequently discovered and he was presented with a Certificate of Merit by the Royal Life Saving Society. Whittle himself was ill for a fortnight due to swallowing some of the foul water in the ornamental lake.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rushing</b> <b>to</b> Fiore's house, Mulder and Scully find Michelle using telekinetic {{powers to}} try to kill Fiore. They prevent her from doing so, and Fiore confesses that he, Felder and Barbala had stolen a large sum of money, {{intending}} to keep it safe for ten years before claiming it. Morris learned of their plan and threatened to report on them, and was consequently killed to silence him. However, Fiore maintains that {{he never wanted to}} see Morris dead and only wanted to take care of Anita after his death. Michelle uses her powers to destroy the fish-tank, but spares Fiore after hearing pleas from Anita not to hurt him. Later, Fiore pleads guilty to charges of murder and grand larceny, whilst Michelle seemingly recovers and goes on to become a normal little girl.|$|E

5|$|After the bungled murder, Raskolnikov {{falls into}} a feverish state and begins to worry obsessively over the murder. He hides the stolen items and purse under a rock, and tries desperately to clean his {{clothing}} of any blood or evidence. He {{falls into a}} fever later that day, though not before calling briefly on his old friend Razumikhin. As the fever comes and goes in the following days, Raskolnikov behaves as though he wishes to betray himself. He shows strange reactions to whoever mentions {{the murder of the}} pawn-broker, which is now known about and talked of in the city. In his delirium, Raskolnikov wanders Saint Petersburg, drawing more and more attention to himself and his relation to the crime. In one of his walks through the city, he sees Marmeladov, who has been struck mortally by a carriage in the streets. <b>Rushing</b> <b>to</b> help him, Raskolnikov gives the remainder of his money to the man's family, which includes his teenage daughter, Sonya, who has been forced to become a prostitute to support her family.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{traveling}} without {{key players}} Marion Motley and Bill Willis because of Florida's segregation laws, Cleveland beat Miami in a shutout {{for the second}} time in the season, winning 34–0. Fueled by the ire the entire team felt because of leaving friends behind, Otto Graham opened the scoring with a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown and the Browns never looked back. Three other Browns players – Edgar Jones, Gaylon Smith and Gene Fekete – ran for touchdowns. Fekete's touchdown was the only one of his short professional career. Groza kicked two field goals, giving him 12 on the season and tying the all-time professional record set in 1926 by Paddy Driscoll. Cleveland led Miami in all phases of the game, amassing 159 yards <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> Miami's eight and 233 yards of total offense. Miami gained a total of 46 yards rushing and passing. As the Browns prepared to face the Dodgers in the last game of the regular season, they looked ahead to a matchup in the AAFC championship in Cleveland on December 22 with the New York Yankees, the winners the eastern division.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1876 Jenny Morris was {{diagnosed}} with epilepsy. Refusing {{to allow her to}} be societally marginalised or institutionalised, as was common in the period, Morris insisted that she be cared for by the family. When Janey took May and Jenny to Oneglia in Italy, the latter suffered a serious seizure, with Morris <b>rushing</b> <b>to</b> the country to see her. They then proceeded to visit a number of other cities, including Venice, Padua, and Verona, with Morris attaining a greater appreciation of the country than he had on his previous trip. In April 1879 Morris moved the family home again, this time renting an 18th-century mansion on Hammersmith's Upper Mall in West London. Owned by the novelist George MacDonald, Morris would name it Kelmscott House and re-decorate it according to his own taste. In the House's grounds he set up a workshop, focusing on the production of hand-knotted carpets. Excited that both of his homes were along the course of the River Thames, in August 1880 he and his family took a boat trip along the river from Kelmscott House to Kelmscott Manor.|$|E
