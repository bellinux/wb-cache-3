5|$|An {{innovative}} {{drilling and}} blasting technique called Penetrating Cone Fracture (PCF) {{was used in}} the remedial works process. PCF was chosen over conventional drilling and/or blasting techniques due to the reduced <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to the existing structure from vibration, as well as lower noxious fume and dust levels.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, pre-dreadnoughts {{continued}} in active service and saw significant combat use even when obsolete. Dreadnoughts and battlecruisers were believed vital for the decisive naval battles {{which at the}} time all nations expected, hence they were jealously guarded against the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> by mines or submarine attack, and kept close to home as much as possible. The obsolescence and consequent expendability of the pre-dreadnoughts meant that they could be deployed into more dangerous situations and more far-flung areas.|$|E
5|$|As the {{radiation}} sources can be precisely positioned at the tumour treatment site, brachytherapy enables a high {{dose of radiation}} {{to be applied to}} a small area. Furthermore, because {{the radiation}} sources are placed in or next to the target tumour, the sources maintain their position in relation to the tumour when the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body. Therefore, the radiation sources remain accurately targeted. This enables clinicians to achieve a high level of dose conformity – i.e. ensuring the whole of the tumour receives an optimal level of radiation. It also reduces the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to healthy tissue, organs or structures around the tumour, thus enhancing the chance of cure and preservation of organ function.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, Swiss {{publisher}} Faksimile-Verlag Luzern requested {{permission to}} produce a full-colour facsimile of the book. Permission was initially denied, because Trinity College officials felt that the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to the book was too high. By 1986, Faksimile-Verlag had developed a process that used gentle suction to straighten a page {{so that it could}} be photographed without touching it and so won permission to publish a new facsimile. After each page was photographed, a single-page facsimile was prepared so the colours could be carefully compared to the original and adjustments made where necessary. The completed work was published in 1990 in a two-volume set containing the full facsimile and scholarly commentary. One copy is held by the Anglican Church in Kells, {{on the site of the}} original monastery.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{management}} of hyperthyroidism may include drugs that suppress thyroid function such as propylthiouracil, carbimazole and methimazole. Radioactive iodine-131 {{can be used}} to destroy thyroid tissue. Radioactive iodine is selectively taken up by the thyroid, which over time destroys the cells involved in its uptake. The chosen first-line treatment will depend on the individual and on the country where being treated. Surgery to remove the thyroid can sometimes be performed as a transoral thyroidectomy, a minimally-invasive procedure. Surgery does however carry a <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to the parathyroid glands and the nerves controlling the vocal cords. If the entire thyroid gland is removed, hypothyroidism will naturally result, and thyroid hormone substitutes will be needed.|$|E
5|$|The Westland Apache {{experienced}} {{delays in}} entering service due to complications with the modifications made for British service. Prior to the Apache entering service in 2004, several development problems were noted, including {{a lack of}} the ability to securely communicate with other helicopters and a <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to the tail rotor and airframe from firing its Hellfire missiles. The problem with using the Hellfire was debris generated by the firing of missiles, both the Hellfire and CRV7 rockets, could strike the body of the aircraft and cause damage; resolving this issue created a delay to training programmes. These problems were corrected prior to entering service, a secure communications suite was installed and Hellfire missiles are routinely fired by Apaches. In 2002, government sources stated that full operational capability was set to be achieved by 2010.|$|E

5|$|Tracheotomy {{consists}} {{of making an}} incision {{on the front of}} the neck and opening a direct airway through an incision in the trachea. The resulting opening can serve independently as an airway or as a site for a tracheostomy tube to be inserted; this tube allows a person to breathe without the use of his nose or mouth. The opening may be made by a scalpel or a needle (referred to as surgical and percutaneous techniques respectively) and both techniques are widely used in current practice. In order to limit the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to the recurrent laryngeal nerves (the nerves that control the voicebox), the tracheotomy is performed as high in the trachea as possible. If only one of these nerves is damaged, the patient's voice may be impaired (dysphonia); if both of the nerves are damaged, the patient will be unable to speak (aphonia). In the acute setting, indications for tracheotomy are similar to those for cricothyrotomy. In the chronic setting, indications for tracheotomy include the need for long-term mechanical ventilation and removal of tracheal secretions (e.g., comatose patients, or extensive surgery involving the head and neck).|$|E

The public is the average consumer {{who does not have}} knowledge about electric vehicles, especially for problem charger. Charger technology in an Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) consists of three types, namely AC level 1, AC level 2 and DC fast charging. Each type has advantages and disadvantages. The disadvantage of AC level 1 type is take a long time for charging (about 20 hours) and the advantage is no <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>damaging</b> the battery. AC level 2 has shortcomings that are still relatively long time to process the charge but shorter process than the AC charge level 1 and there is no high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>damaging</b> to the battery. DC fast charging has excesscharge process is very short (express) at range 20 - 30 minutes, but the disatvantage is very high <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>damaging</b> the batteries in continuous USAge.

25|$|Early {{diagnosis}} {{in children}} is crucial as {{studies have shown}} that the children with VUR who present with a UTI and associated acute pyelonephritis are more likely to develop permanent renal cortical scarring than those children without VUR, with an odds ratio of 2.8.

25|$|Central IV lines carry {{risks of}} bleeding, infection, gangrene, {{thromboembolism}} and gas embolism (see Risks below).

Surrounding structures such as the pleura and carotid artery are also at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> {{with the potential for}} pneumothorax or even cannulation of the artery.|$|E

25|$|Aminoglycosides (STM, {{capreomycin}} and amikacin) {{should be}} avoided in patients with mild to severe kidney problems because of the increased <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>damage</b> to the kidneys.
