50|$|The <b>ringed</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Megaceryle torquata) is a large, {{conspicuous}} {{and noisy}} kingfisher commonly found along the lower Rio Grande valley in southeasternmost Texas in the United States through Central America to Tierra del Fuego in South America.|$|E
5000|$|The {{four large}} crested kingfishers, Megaceryle, {{have a wide}} {{distribution}} in Africa, Asia and America. The belted kingfisher, (M. alcyon), is the only kingfisher that is widespread in North America, though the <b>ringed</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (M. torquata) may be found {{as far north as}} Texas and Arizona.|$|E
5000|$|The {{previous}} {{view that}} the Megaceryle kingfishers arose in the New World from a specialist fish-eating Alcedinid ancestor which crossed the Bering Strait and gave rise to this genus and the American green kingfishers Chloroceryle, with a large crested species later, in the Pliocene, crossing the Atlantic Ocean to give rise to the giant and crested kingfishers [...] is probably wrong. Rather, it now seems that the genus probably originates in the Old World, possibly Africa, and the ancestor of the belted and <b>ringed</b> <b>kingfishers</b> made the ocean crossing ...|$|R
50|$|Not {{longer than}} 5 {{million years ago}} - {{possibly}} as recently as 2.9 million years ago - an Old World giant kingfisher became the ancestor of the belted and <b>ringed</b> <b>kingfishers,</b> and later, another species related to the pied kingfisher became the ancestor of the Chloroceryle green kingfishers after colonizing the Americas. While the evolutionary history of the water kingfishers in regard to their internal relationships is well resolved, it is not entirely clear whether they evolved from river kingfishers or tree kingfishers, and whether they immigrated across the Atlantic or the Pacific Ocean (though the former seems more likely).|$|R
50|$|The Towy and {{surrounding}} valley (Dyffryn Tywi) {{are home to}} a very large variety of water and wetland birds. Among the more distinctive species found along the river are sand martins, common sandpipers, little <b>ringed</b> plovers, dippers, <b>kingfishers</b> and grey wagtails. Red kites and buzzards are numerous. Goosanders and cormorants prey on sea trout and salmon.|$|R
50|$|The Megaceryle {{large green}} kingfishers were {{formerly}} placed in Ceryle with the pied kingfisher, but {{the latter is}} closer to the Chloroceryle American green kingfishers. The belted kingfisher's closest living relative is the <b>ringed</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (M. torquata), and these two in all probability originated from an African Megaceryle which colonized the Americas.|$|E
50|$|Threatened and {{vulnerable}} species include West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), pearly parakeet (Pyrrhura lepida), bearded bellbird (Procnias averano), wattled jacana (Jacana jacana) and American purple gallinule (Porphyrula martinica).Other bird species include striated heron (Butorides striata), black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), great egret (Ardea alba), <b>ringed</b> <b>kingfisher</b> (Megaceryle torquata), blue dacnis (Dacnis cayana), rufescent tiger heron (Tigrisoma lineatum), white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata), Neotropic cormorant (Phalacrocorax brasilianus) and white-winged swallow (Tachycineta albiventer).|$|E
50|$|All are {{specialist}} fish-eaters with prominent stiff crests {{on their}} heads. They have dark grey or bluish-grey upperparts, largely unmarked {{in the two}} American species, but heavily spotted with white in the Asian crested kingfisher and the African giant kingfisher. The underparts may be white or rufous, and all forms have a contrasting breast band except male <b>ringed</b> <b>kingfisher.</b> The underpart pattern is always different for the two sexes of each species.|$|E
50|$|In the {{southern}} {{portion of the}} park (Queulat mountain pass), wildlife includes mammals such as pudú, kodkod, {{and a variety of}} birds species including chucao tapaculo, Chilean pigeon, Magellanic woodpecker, black-throated huet-huet and thorn-tailed rayadito. The northern sections of the park are home to nearshore wildlife including semi-aquatic mammals as are southern river otter and coypu. Birds found in this area include Magellan goose, Chiloe wigeon, yellow-billed pintail, red shoveler, flying steamer duck, rosy-billed pochard, red-gartered coot, <b>ringed</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> great egret, cocoi heron, black-crowned night heron, torrent duck, sedge wren, Chilean flicker and black-necked swan.|$|E
50|$|These water kingfishers are {{descended from}} a common {{ancestor}} {{which seems to have}} been closely related to a progenitor of the pied kingfisher (which at that stage had not yet lost the metallic plumage tone), and are similar in plumage and habits (Moyle, 2006). All four have overlapping ranges, and may fish the same waters; however the weight ratio of aenea: americana: inda: amazona is almost exactly 1:2:4:8, which prevents direct competition for food. The <b>ringed</b> <b>kingfisher,</b> Megaceryle torquata, a more distant relative, also occurs on the same rivers, but is twice as heavy as the Amazon kingfisher.|$|E
50|$|The kingfishers have a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, occurring throughout the world's tropical and temperate regions. They are {{absent from the}} polar regions {{and some of the}} world's driest deserts. A number of species have reached islands groups, particularly those in the south and east Pacific Ocean. The Old World tropics and Australasia are the core areas for this group. Europe and North America north of Mexico are very poorly represented, with only one common kingfisher (common kingfisher and belted kingfisher, respectively), and a couple of uncommon or very local species each: (<b>ringed</b> <b>kingfisher</b> and green kingfisher in the southwestern United States, pied kingfisher and white-throated kingfisher in southeastern Europe). The six species occurring in the Americas are four closely related green kingfishers in the genus Chloroceryle and two large crested kingfishers in the genus Megaceryle. Even tropical South America has only five species plus the wintering belted kingfisher. In comparison, the African country of the Gambia has eight resident species in its 120 by 20 mi area.|$|E
40|$|The subantarctic {{forests of}} South America are the world’s southernmost forested ecosystems. The birds have sung in these austral forests for {{millions}} of years; the Yahgan and Mapuche peoples have handed down their bird stories {{from generation to generation}} for hundreds of years. In Multi-ethnic Bird Guide of the Subantarctic Forests of South America, Ricardo Rozzi and his collaborators present a unique combination of bird guide and cultural ethnography. The bird songs, names and stories recorded on the CDs of the guide book includes entries on fifty bird species of southern Chile and Argentina, among them the Magellanic Woodpecker, Rufous-Legged Owl, <b>Ringed</b> <b>Kingfisher,</b> Buff-Necked Ibis, Giant Hummingbird, and Andean Condor. Each bird is named in Yahgan, Mapudungun, Spanish, English, and scientific nomenclature. As a whole, the recordings of this guide book express the voices of multiple species and indigenous, rural and urban cultures, whose lives are interwoven in the temperate forest region of South America...|$|E

40|$|The Pantanal region (Brazil) {{is under}} {{increasing}} anthropic pressure {{partly due to}} an increase in tourism and {{there is a lack of}} information about the influence of human presence on avifauna. Here we study the relationships between human activity in the river (boats and fishermen) and 15 bird species along a 70 km stretch of the Paraguay River, also including other confounding factors such as distance to towns and spatial autocorrelation. Human density along the river was low and as expected decreased with distance from towns. Bird richness and density were negatively associated with human density and the distance to towns along the river, suggesting a permanent impact on avifauna. Riparian forests had higher bird density. Four species were apparently sensitive to human presence: the anhinga Anhinga anhinga, the great white egret Egretta alba, the <b>ringed</b> <b>kingfisher</b> Megaceryle torquata and the southern screamer Chauna torquata. Thus, these species could serve as indicators of human pressure. Any management plan for sustainable development of the study area should preserve the riparian forest, consider the control of numbers of tourists and people in the river, and monitor the bird community, especially the sensitive species...|$|E
