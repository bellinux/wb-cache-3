5|$|After Babs {{passed the}} hardest hit areas, workers were {{initially}} unable to distribute food and medicine due to ferry service being halted. Many provinces and islands were isolated after the storm, necessitating helicopter travel to be reached by national aid workers. The Department of Public Works and Highways worked quickly to clear the landslides and reopen closed roads. The country's National Food Authority provided about 73,000sacks of <b>rice</b> <b>to</b> storm victims, and the country planned to import 300,000tonnes of <b>rice</b> <b>to</b> overcome the lost crops. The Philippine Red Cross deployed search and rescue teams, as well as distributing food and coffee to 35,500people. The International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement launched a global request for assistance worth about $2.2million to help 240,000people.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after he}} signed the contract, several other {{shiploads}} of rice arrived from Peru, causing the price of <b>rice</b> <b>to</b> plummet to three cents a pound. Norton tried to void the contract, stating the dealer had misled him as {{to the quality of}} <b>rice</b> <b>to</b> expect. From 1853 to 1857, Norton and the rice dealers were involved in a protracted litigation. Although Norton prevailed in the lower courts, the case reached the Supreme Court of California, which ruled against Norton. Later, the Lucas Turner and Company Bank foreclosed on his real estate holdings in North Beach to pay Norton's debt. He filed for bankruptcy and by 1858 was living in reduced circumstances at a working class boarding house.|$|E
5|$|By {{about two}} weeks after the storm's landfall, water and power service were being {{restored}} in Toamasina, although by that time, 40% of the communications network remained offline. By February16, the road from Antananrivo and Toamasina had been reopened. The Malagasy government imported oil for several months while its refinery was out of order. Non-government organizations provided <b>rice</b> <b>to</b> stabilize prices. The damaged rail line between Antananarivo and the coast was rebuilt in 2003. Schools that were repaired following Geralda were later successfully used as shelters.|$|E

5|$|In Basse Casamance, {{the rice}} cycle {{structures}} {{the lives of}} the population and plays a central economic and religious role. The Jola, who constitute 80 to 90% of the population of Basse Casamance, practice a unique form of rice cultivation. Descriptions of the techniques used in the late 15th century, recorded by the first Portuguese explorers, show them to be similar to those still in use, particularly with respect to flooding and transplanting. Only the varieties of rice have changed, from African <b>rice</b> <b>to</b> Asian rice, a separate species.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the storm and associated flooding, the Department of Agriculture readied for the distribution of 3million bangus fry, 250,000tilapia fry, and 315bags of rice seeds to affected regions. Furthermore, the National Food Authority allocated 200sacks of <b>rice</b> <b>to</b> Pangasinan. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council assisted in relief operations by allocating ₱10million (US$200,000) and 800bags of rice for such efforts.

5|$|On Mayotte, Ernest {{produced}} peak wind {{gusts of}} 98km/h (61mph). The storm drew moisture away from Malawi, causing a nine-day period of dry conditions. A {{few days after}} Ernest struck Madagascar, 2004–05 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season#Moderate Tropical Storm FelapiTropical Storm Felapi affected the same region and produced further flooding. The combined effects of the storms killed 78people and left over 32,000 homeless. Widespread crop damage sparked food protests, although the World Food Programme provided an emergency supply of <b>rice</b> <b>to</b> affected residents.|$|E
5|$|Portions of {{the country}} faced {{shortages}} of rice due to crop damage from Ernest, {{as well as from}} Cyclone Gafilo in the previous year. This caused prices to increase, resulting in street protests. As a result, the World Food Programme provided 45tons of <b>rice</b> <b>to</b> affected residents, although persistent flooding disrupted relief work. In general, damage from Ernest and Felapi were less than that from Gafilo in the previous year. Madagascar's National Emergency Centre deployed workers to do search and rescue missions and provide water to storm victims.|$|E
5|$|The Antiquary {{was printed}} at Mazgaon, Bombay, by the Bombay Education Society {{and later the}} British India Press, but {{illustrations}} were produced in London by the firm of Griggs who were known for the accuracy of their work. A high standard of reproduction was essential so that scholars could work on the epigraphic material without needing to see the originals. Illustrations in the Antiquary were used by scholars such as Bhandarkar, Bhagvanlal Indraji, Georg Bühler, John Faithfull Fleet, Eggeling and B.

5|$|After the German {{invasion}} of the Netherlands in 1940, {{the government of the}} Indies began preparing for a possible Japanese invasion. In Langkat, a Home Guard, or Stadswacht, division was established to defend Tanjung Pura, in Langkat. Amir and his cousin Tengku Harun were in charge; the nobility, trusted by the general populace, was selected to ensure easier recruitment of commoners. When the invasion became a reality in early 1942, Amir was one of the soldiers sent to Medan to defend it. He and the other Dutch-allied forces were quickly captured by the Japanese. He was held as a prisoner of war until 1943, when influence from the Sultan allowed him to be released. Throughout the remainder of the occupation, which lasted until 1945, Amir was employed as a radio commentator and censor in Medan. In his position as prince, he was tasked with helping to collect <b>rice</b> <b>to</b> feed the Japanese occupation army.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan rarely {{consulted}} Breckinridge {{when making}} patronage appointments, and meetings {{between the two}} were infrequent. When Breckinridge and Buchanan endorsed the Lecompton Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a slave state instead of allowing the people to vote, they managed to alienate most Northern Democrats, including Douglas. This disagreement ended plans for Breckinridge, Douglas, and Minnesota's Henry Mower <b>Rice</b> <b>to</b> build {{a series of three}} elaborate, conjoined row houses in which to live during their time in Washington, D.C. In November 1857, after Breckinridge found alternative lodging in Washington, he sold a slave woman and her young infant which, according to historian James C. Klotter, probably ended his days as a slaveholder. When Breckinridge did not travel to Illinois to campaign for Douglas's re-election to the Senate and gave him only a lukewarm endorsement, relations between them worsened.|$|E
