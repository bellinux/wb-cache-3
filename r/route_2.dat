On weekends and public holidays, route 932 provides an hourly service along the same streets as <b>route</b> <b>2.</b>|$|E
5|$|U.S. Route 5 was {{designated}} in 1926 along the <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> alignment. Between 1926 and 1932, U.S. Route 5 and <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> were co-signed throughout {{the length of}} the route. In the 1932 state highway renumbering, the <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> designation was removed, leaving only the US 5 designation. Only a small number of changes have been made since then, the most prominent being in the cities of New Haven and Hartford.|$|E
5|$|In the 1927 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, Route 17N {{received}} the <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> designation, and was defined {{to run from}} Route 7 in North Arlington to the New York border near Suffern, New York. By 1937, the whole old road north of Rutherford was bypassed by a new four-lane divided highway {{with the exception of}} the 1927 bridge over the Saddle River in Ridgewood, north of the Paramus Road interchange. This old alignment joins at Paramus Road and leaves just north of the bridge at Franklin Turnpike, which only has access to the southbound lanes through a RIRO intersection. A short-lived spur of <b>Route</b> <b>2,</b> Route 2N, was defined in 1938 to run from <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> (Ridge Road) in Lyndhurst west along Kingsland Avenue and over the Passaic River on the Park Avenue Bridge into Nutley, where it would end at Union Avenue (west of Route 7). In 1930, New York had renumbered its state routes; the extension of <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> north and west into New York had remained New York State Route 17. New Jersey had not assigned a Route 17 in the 1927 renumbering, and so in March 1942, <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> was numbered Route 17 to match and provide a single number for military caravans during World War II.|$|E

5|$|When the New England {{road marking}} system was adopted in 1922, <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> was {{assigned}} to a route from New Haven north via Hartford and Springfield towards Sherbrooke, Quebec. This route followed the older blue-banded route from New Haven north to Hartford. At Hartford, <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> crossed the Connecticut River on the Bulkeley Bridge and ran north from East Hartford to Springfield {{on the east side}} of the river.|$|E
5|$|In 1989 Eastern Harbour Crossing was {{completed}}. Kwun Tong Bypass {{was completed}} in 1991. To construct an interchange for both roads, the intersection between Lei Yue Mun Road and Kai Tin Road was rebuilt into a flyover-roundabout.

5|$|Moncton {{was placed}} on the Trans-Canada Highway network in the early 1960s after <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> was built along the {{northern}} perimeter of the city. Later, the Route 15 was built between the city and Shediac. At the same time, the Petitcodiac River Causeway was constructed. The Universit√© de Moncton was founded in 1963. This institution became an important resource in the development of Acadian culture in the area.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1927, {{what is now}} US 206 in New Jersey was legislated as part {{of several}} routes. Between Bordentown and Trenton, the current {{alignment}} was designated {{as a part of}} pre-1927 <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> in 1916. Between Trenton and Princeton, present-day US 206 became the southernmost part of pre-1927 Route 13 in 1917. In 1921, the current route from Princeton north to Bedminster Township was legislated as part of pre-1927 Route 16.|$|E

5|$|The {{entire length}} of US 130 follows {{a part of the}} Ocean Highway, a coastal highway that ran from New Brunswick south to Jacksonville, Florida. The current route was {{designated}} as portions of three state routes prior to 1927. In 1916, the road between the Camden area and Bordentown was legislated as part of pre-1927 <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> while the current US 130 north of Robbinsville was {{to become a part of}} pre-1927 Route 1. In addition, pre-1927 Route 17S was legislated to run from Penns Grove northeast to Westville in 1923; the only portion of road built ran from Pennsville south to Salem. When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926, US 130 was designated to connect US 30 in Camden to US 1 in Trenton, following pre-1927 <b>Route</b> <b>2.</b> In the 1927 renumbering a year later, the US 130 alignment was designated Route 25 from Camden to Bordentown, Route 39 from Bordentown to White Horse, and Route 37 from White Horse to Trenton.|$|E
5|$|Two other limited-access {{highways}} serve Cleveland. The Cleveland Memorial Shoreway carries State <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> {{along its}} length, and at varying points also carries US 6, US 20 and I-90. The Jennings Freeway (State Route 176) connects I-71 {{just south of}} I-90 to I-480 near the suburbs of Parma and Brooklyn Heights. A third highway, the Berea Freeway (State Route 237 in part), connects I-71 to the airport, and forms part of the boundary between Cleveland and Brook Park.|$|E

5|$|US 5 roughly {{follows the}} route {{used by the}} Upper Boston Post Road, an early colonial highway for {{transporting}} mail between New York City and Boston. The route was first improved in 1798 as the Hartford and New Haven Turnpike, which ran in a nearly straight line between the court houses of New Haven and Hartford. In 1922, the Upper Boston Post Road corridor was designated as <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> of the New England road marking system, crossing {{to the east of}} the Connecticut River in Hartford before continuing north to the Massachusetts state line. In 1926, <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> was redesignated as U.S. Route 5. Several realignments {{have been made in the}} cities of New Haven and Hartford with the opening of several expressways in these areas. Because it is closely paralleled by Interstate 91 between New Haven and Hartford, US 5 serves mainly as a secondary route today.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of its}} {{construction}} of concrete roads, started by a 1913 bond issue, Orange County paved the county road through Laguna Canyon, connecting State Highway <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> (the forerunner of U.S. Hwy. 101 and I-5) at Irvine with Laguna Beach, by 1917. The road {{was added to the}} state highway system in 1933 as Route 185, an unsigned designation. The entire route was added to the new California Freeway and Expressway System in 1959; the planned upgrade had already been named the Laguna Freeway by the California Highway Commission on November 26, 1957. The highway received a sign route numberState Route 133in the 1964 renumbering.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the freeway}} began in 1975 {{in the two}} states. Due to a chronic lack of funding, {{construction}} in Ohio was stalled between 1976 and 1981. After a 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) fuel tax increase, Ohio was able to restart construction, and by 1983, both states had completed construction on the freeway. The three-level diamond interchange with concurrent highways U.S. Route 250 (US250) and West Virginia <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> (WV2) on the eastern banks of the Ohio River {{was thought to be}} the most complex interchange in West Virginia's Interstate Highway System at the time of construction. On average, between 25,500 and 37,840vehicles use the highway daily.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1927, {{the route}} between present-day Route 70 in Lakehurst and present-day County Route 527 in Toms River {{was a part}} of Pre-1927 Route 18, which was legislated in 1923 to run from Camden to Toms River. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, Route 37 was legislated to run from Route 27 and Route 30 (now U.S. Route 1 Business, U.S. Route 206, and Route 31) in Trenton to Route 35 (now Route 88) in Point Pleasant, passing through White Horse, Allentown, Lakehurst, Toms River, and Seaside Heights.

5|$|Prior to 1927, {{the route}} was {{designated}} as Route 17N, {{which was to}} run from Newark to the New York state line. This route had followed various local streets, including the Franklin Turnpike north of Hackensack. In 1927, Route 17N became <b>Route</b> <b>2,</b> which was designated along the portion of Route 17N between Route 7 in North Arlington to the New York border near Suffern, New York. This route was moved to a multilane divided highway alignment north of Rutherford by 1937. <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> became Route 17 in 1942 to match the designation of New York State Route 17 for defense purposes during World War II. The entire Route 17 corridor was once planned to be a freeway until the 1960s and later plans to extend the route south of Route 3 to Interstate 280 in 1972 and to the New Jersey Turnpike in 1987 both failed. Over the years, the portion of Route 17 north of Route 3 has seen many improvements, including the widening {{of much of the}} road to six lanes and the removal of most at-grade intersections in the 1950s as well as more recent improvements to the interchanges with Route 4 in Paramus in 1999 and Essex Street on the Lodi/Maywood border in 2008. The route is currently undergoing improvements between Route 3 and U.S. Route 46 and is expected to see improvements from Williams Avenue in Hasbrouck Heights to south of Route 4 in Paramus.|$|E
5|$|The current US 46 {{was marked}} in 1936 between Portland, Pennsylvania and the George Washington Bridge. At the time, the new Route 6 {{had not been}} {{completed}} from <b>Route</b> <b>2</b> (now Route 17) west to Route S6 (now Route 62), and so US 46 was marked through Paterson until this portion was completed by the 1940s. At {{the west end of}} Route 6, US 46 continued over the Delaware River on the Delaware Bridge into Pennsylvania, replacing Pennsylvania Route 987 north to Portland, where it ended at US 611. The Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge and its associated freeway to Columbia (now I-80) opened in December 1953, as did the new Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge.|$|E
