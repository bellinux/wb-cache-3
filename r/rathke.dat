40|$|Summary: We {{report a}} case of {{symptomatic}} <b>Rathke’s</b> cleft cyst with ossification. CT scans showed curvilinear calcifi-cation {{on the wall of}} the cyst. MR images revealed a cystic sellar lesion with a nodular solid mass extending to the floor of the third ventricle. This case shows that calcifica-tion of the suprasellar cyst does not always suggest cran-iopharyngioma. <b>Rathke’s</b> cysts should be histologically dif-ferentiated from craniopharyngiomas because their treatments are different. Symptomatic <b>Rathke’s</b> cleft cysts are rare epi-thelial cysts that have been recognized increasingly on MR images (1 – 3). Calcification is rare in Rath-ke’s cleft cysts, and its presence is used as a pre-surgical diagnostic clue in the diagnosis of cran-iopharyngioma. We present {{a case of}} <b>Rathke’s</b> clef...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn the pituitary, the {{transition}} from proliferating progenitor cell into differentiated hormone producing cell is carefully regulated in a time-dependent and spatially-restricted manner. We report that two targets of Notch signaling, Hes 1 and Prop 1, are needed to maintain progenitors within <b>Rathke's</b> pouch and for the restriction of differentiated cells to the ventral pituitary. We observed ACTH and αGSU producing cells that had prematurely differentiated within <b>Rathke's</b> pouch along with correlated ectopic expression of Mash 1 only when both Prop 1 and Hes 1 were lost. We also discovered that downregulation of N-cadherin expression in cells as they transition from <b>Rathke's</b> pouch to the anterior lobe appears to be essential for their movement. In the Prop 1 mutant, cells are trapped in <b>Rathke's</b> pouch and N-cadherin expression remains high. Also, Slug, a marker of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, is absent in the dorsal anterior lobe. When Hes 1 is lost in the Prop 1 mutant, N-cadherin is downregulated and cells are able to exit <b>Rathke's</b> pouch but have lost their migrational cues and form ectopic foci surrounding <b>Rathke's</b> pouch. Our data reveal important overlapping functions of Hes 1 and Prop 1 in cell differentiation and movement that are critical for pituitary organogenesis...|$|R

But Wolff had no immediate successors.

40|$|Reverse transcription-polymerase chain {{reaction}} (RT-PCR) with specific GnRH cDNA primers performed on RNA from <b>Rathke's</b> pouches removed from pregnant rats at day 12 of gestation (e 12) generated an amplified DNA fragment {{of the expected}} length (357 bp). The fragment hybridized with a labeled GnRH cDNA probe in Southern blotting. DNA sequencing demonstrated identity with the known nucleotide sequence of the corresponding segment of rat GnRH cDNA. To determine whether GnRH mRNA was located in the <b>Rathke's</b> pouch cells or in remnants of surrounding tissue not completely removed during preparation, the pouches were treated with collagenase. Based on light and electron microscopic examination, this treatment disconnected virtually all contaminating tissue, allowing the 'pure' <b>Rathke's</b> pouches to be picked-up separately. Again, RT-PCR generated a DNA fragment of the expected length, the fragment hybridized with the GnRH cDNA probe and showed the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding region of rat GnRH cDNA. In <b>Rathke's</b> pouches established in explant culture on e 12, lactotrophs were well developed when examined 9 days later by immunostaining of prolactin in paraffin-embedded sections of the tissue. Computerized image analysis showed prolactin immunoreactivity in 8. 0 +/- 1. 1 % of the section area. Addition of the potent and long-acting GnRH antagonist ORG 30276 to the crude preparation of <b>Rathke's</b> pouches caused {{a significant decrease in}} the relative area staining for prolactin. The latter effect was abolished by concomitant addition of GnRH. In preparations of pure <b>Rathke's</b> pouches (collagenase-treated), ORG 30276 failed to affect the relative area of prolactin immunoreactivity. GnRH mRNA remained expressed in explants of both crude and pure <b>Rathke's</b> pouches {{until the end of the}} culture period. It is concluded that the GnRH gene is expressed in <b>Rathke's</b> pouch as early as e 12 and that GnRH may be a physiological paracrine/autocrine peptide stimulating the development of lactotrophs.

60|$|The oak is a {{more complex}} thing than the little {{rudimentary}} plant contained in the acorn; the caterpillar {{is more complex than}} the egg; the butterfly than the caterpillar; and each of these beings, in passing from its rudimentary to its perfect condition, runs through a series of changes, the sum of which is called its Development. In the higher animals these changes are extremely complicated; but, within the last half century, the labours of such men as Von Baer, <b>Rathke,</b> Reichert, Bischof, and Remak, have almost completely unravelled them, so that the successive stages of development which are exhibited by a Dog, for example, are now as well known to the embryologist as are the steps of the metamorphosis of the silkworm moth to the school-boy. It will be useful to consider with attention the nature and the order of the stages of canine development, {{as an example of the}} process in the higher animals generally.|$|E
6000|$|That {{which we}} may {{distinguish}} as transverse integration, is well illustrated among the Annulosa {{in the development}} of the nervous system. Leaving out those simple forms which do not present distinct ganglia, it is to be observed that the lower annulose animals, in common with the larvæ of the higher, are severally characterized by a double chain of ganglia running from end to end of the body; while in the more advanced annulose animals this double chain becomes a single chain. Mr. Newport has described the course of this concentration in insects; and by <b>Rathke</b> it has been traced in crustaceans. In the early stages of the Astacus fluviatilis, or common cray-fish, there is a pair of separate ganglia to each ring. Of the fourteen pairs belonging to the head and thorax, the three pairs in advance of the mouth consolidate into one mass to form the brain, or cephalic ganglion. Meanwhile out of the remainder, the first six pairs severally unite in the median line, while the rest remain more or less separate. Of these six double ganglia thus formed, the anterior four coalesce into one mass; the remaining two coalesce into another mass; and then these two masses coalesce into one. Here we see longitudinal and transverse integration going on simultaneously; and in the highest crustaceans they are both carried still further. The Vertebrata exhibit this transverse integration {{in the development of}} the generative system. The lowest of the mammalia--the Monotremata--in common with birds, have oviducts which towards their lower extremities are dilated into cavities severally performing in an imperfect way the function of a uterus. [...] "In the Marsupialia, there is a closer approximation of the two lateral sets of organs on the median line; for the oviducts converge towards one another and meet (without coalescing) on the median line; so that their uterine dilatations are in contact with each other, forming a true 'double uterus.' ... As we ascend the series of 'placental' mammals, we find the lateral coalescence becoming gradually more and more complete.... In many of the Rodentia, the uterus still remains completely divided into two lateral halves; whilst in others, these coalesce at their lower portion, forming a rudiment of the true 'body' of the uterus in the Human subject. This part increases at the expense of the lateral 'cornua' in the higher Herbivora and Carnivora; but even in the lower Quadrumana, the uterus is somewhat cleft at its summit."[6] And this process of transverse integration, which is still more striking when observed in its details, is accompanied by parallel though less important changes in the opposite sex. Once more; in the increasing commissural connexion of the cerebral hemispheres, which, though separate in the lower vertebrata, become gradually more united in the higher, we have another instance. And further ones of a different order, but of like general implication, are supplied by the vascular system.|$|E

Therefore, transgenic mice expressing pituitary-directed LIF driven by the rat growth hormone (GH) promoter were generated to evaluate the impact of LIF on pituitary development. Three founders were established with diminished linear growth and body weight (57 - 65 % of wild type [WT]), and intense anterior pituitary LIF immunoreactivity. Cystic cavities observed in pituitary anterior lobes were lined by cuboidal, ciliated epithelial cells, focally immunopositive for cytokeratin and S- 100 protein and immunonegative for adenohypophyseal hormones. Transgenic pituitaries showed decreased GH (40 %) and prolactin (PRL) (26 %) cells, and decreased GH and PRL mRNAs by in situ hybridization. ACTH cells increased 2. 2 -fold, whereas gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs were unchanged. Serum GH was undetectable (< 0. 78 ng/ml), PRL levels were one third of WT (P < 0. 05), IGF-I levels were 30 % of WT (P < 0. 001), and T 4 was normal. 10 human pituitary <b>Rathke's</b> cysts studied all showed conclusive LIF immunoreactivity in cyst-lining cells.
