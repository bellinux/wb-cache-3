5|$|Pallas is {{farther from}} Earth {{and has a}} much lower albedo than Vesta, and hence is dimmer as seen from Earth. Indeed, the much smaller 7 Iris {{marginally}} exceeds Pallas in mean opposition magnitude. Pallas's mean opposition magnitude is +8.0, which is well {{within the range of}} 10×50 binoculars, but, unlike Ceres and Vesta, it will require more-powerful optical aid to view at small elongations, when its magnitude can drop as low as +10.6. During rare perihelic oppositions, Pallas can reach a magnitude of +6.4, <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of naked-eye visibility. During late February 2014 Pallas shone with magnitude 6.96.|$|E

Across Kilver Street (the A37) is Kilver Court, which {{over the course of}} the 20th century has been a factory, the headquarters of the Showerings brewing business, and then the headquarters of a leather-goods manufacturer, Mulberry.

5|$|SR57 {{begins at}} the Orange Crush {{interchange}} near downtown Orange, where it meets the northwest–southeast Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) and the east–west Garden Grove Freeway (SR22). The Orange Crush interchange, which had long been considered a major bottleneck, was rebuilt in the 1990s and 2000s. The freeway heads north from the junction and soon crosses to {{the west side of}} the Santa Ana River, continuing north through suburban portions of Anaheim and passing next to Anaheim Regional Transportation Intermodal Center, Angel Stadium and Honda Center. In northern Anaheim, SR57 meets the Riverside Freeway (SR 91). SR57 briefly passes through Placentia and Fullerton, providing access to California State University, Fullerton. As it crosses Imperial Highway (SR 90) near the Brea Mall and enters Brea, SR57 enters more rugged terrain before climbing through Brea Canyon, the gap between the Chino Hills and Puente Hills. Near the rim of the canyon, the highway curves north out of the Brea Canyon, and descends slightly to a junction with the Pomona Freeway (SR 60) in Diamond Bar, <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of the San Gabriel Valley.|$|E

2500|$|Leading {{up to the}} 24 November election, the Coalition {{had been}} behind Labor in the polls for almost two years, a margin that grew even larger after Rudd became {{opposition}} leader. In the election, Howard and his government were defeated, suffering a 23-seat swing to Labor, which was almost {{as large as the}} 29-seat swing that propelled him to power in 1996. Howard lost his seat of Bennelong to former journalist Maxine McKew by 44,685 votes (51.4 percent) to Howard's 42,251 (48.6 percent). [...] The latest redistribution placed Bennelong <b>right</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> of seats Labor needed to win in order to make Rudd Prime Minister. [...] The ABC actually listed Bennelong as a Labor gain on election night. However, the final result remained in doubt for {{a few days after the}} election. [...] The final tally indicated that McKew defeated Howard on the 14th count due to a large flow of Green preferences to her; 3,793 (78.84 percent) of Green voters listed McKew as their second preference. [...] Howard is the second Australian prime minister, after Stanley Bruce, to lose his seat in an election. He remained in office as caretaker prime minister until the formal swearing in of Rudd's government on 3 December.|$|E
