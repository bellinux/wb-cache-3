40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} case study demonstrating that using the REVAC {{parameter}} tuning method we can greatly improve the ‘world champion ’ EA (the winner of the CEC- 2005 competition) with little effort. For ‘normal ’ EAs the margins for possible improvements are likely much bigger. Thus, the main message {{of this paper is}} that using REVAC great performance improvements are possible for many EAs at moderate costs. Our experiments also disclose the existence of ‘specialized generalists’, that is, EAs that are generally good on a set of test problems, but only w. r. t. one performance measure and not along another one. This shows that the notion of robust parameters is questionable and the issue requires further research. Finally, the results <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>what</b> the outcome of the CEC- 2005 competition would have been, if all of EAs had been tuned by REVAC, but without furthe...|$|E

This is done using a comparative case study design with competence gap data from twenty-four SMEs in China and Austria.

Indeed, we found out that while internationalized SMEs perceive organizational competence gaps as higher as individual ones – exactly the opposite is found at the SMEs working exclusively in their home markets.

In this paper the authors <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>what</b> the causes of the sluggish catching-up process are, and which opportunities Estonian economic policy has in order to close the wealth gap. It turns out that Estonia faces a serious productivity problem, particularly in the manufacturing sector producing tradable goods which is normally the driving engine behind economic and technological catching-up.

40|$|A recent {{paper by}} Dowrick and Golley (2004) {{finds that the}} impact of trade on growth varies with income. In particular, during the period 1980 - 2000, trade is {{observed}} to yield larger benefits for the more advanced economies. This result is backed up by Dejong and Ripoll (2005) who show that the richer countries benefit more from tariff reduction than the poorer countries. These findings <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>question,</b> <b>what</b> is it about high levels of per capita income that enable richer economies to take better advantage of trade? It appears that the reason behind the success of the high income economies is the high quality institutions. These institutions not only boost growth directly but they impact economic performance indirectly by improving trade. We capture the complementarity between institutions and trade by estimating an empirical growth model which includes an interactive term involving these two variables. Better quality institutions are indicative of lower transaction costs which facilitates trade. It also ensures better distribution of the gains from trade paving the way for further trade and growth. ...|$|E

40|$|HLA-C {{mismatches}} {{are clearly}} associated to alloreactivity after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation; {{in a number}} of large cohorts, HLA-C mismatches are correlated to an increased risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or even impaired survival. While for HLA-A and -B both antigenic as well as allelic mismatches are associated with an increased risk of acute GVHD, such an increased risk is only observed for antigenic HLA-C mismatches and not for allelic mismatches. These observations <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>what</b> sets HLA-C apart from HLA-A and -B. The difference may well be related to the reduced levels of cell-surface expression of HLA-C as compared to HLA-A and -B, possibly due to, amongst other factors, a limited peptide-binding capacity. This limited peptide-binding capacity may retain HLA-C in the ER and enhance degradation of the HLA-C protein. Once degraded, HLA-C-derived peptides can be presented to the immune system via other HLA-alleles and are thus available for indirect recognition. Indeed, such HLA-C derived peptides have previously been eluted from other HLA alleles. We have recently developed an approach to predict indirect recognition of HLA molecules, by establishing the numbers of Predicted Indirectly ReCognizable HLA Epitopes (PIRCHES). The number of PIRCHES presented on HLA class I and II, PIRCHE-I and –II respectively, are highly correlated to clinical measures of alloreactivity, such as acute GVHD. In the present Hypothesis & Theory, we reviewed the current knowledge on HLA-C mismatches and alloreactivity. Moreover, we speculate about the role of direct and indirect recognition of HLA-C and the consequences for donor selection in HLA-C mismatched stem-cell transplantation...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Malignant {{melanoma}} is {{a disease}} which has a cutaneous origin in 90 % of the patients, but in rare cases, {{it could be discovered}} as secondary deposits with unknown primary site. Metastatic Malignant Melanoma occurs without a primary site in about 3 % of all melanoma patients, and it could be divided into two main groups: metastatic lymph nodes’ involvement or non-lymph nodes disease. The lack of unified classification and staging system, provided by AJCC (2009), as well as the lack for curtain diagnostic and therapeutic protocol, prompt us to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>what</b> is the right way to precede in cases of metastasis of the lymph nodes, without evidence of a primary tumour? CASE REPORT: We report a case of 67 -years- old woman who presented in the dermatology clinic after a surgical removal of an enlarged lymph node in her left femoral area, verified histologically as a metastasis of melanoma. After a diagnostic refinement in the clinic, the diagnosis of metastasis of malignant melanoma was confirmed by histology revision. We use the presented case to create {{for the first time in}} the world literature a novel stereotype of thinking, which is also followed by a stereotype of clinical behaviour – gentle to the patient, but providing a certain amount of security and satisfaction for the medical staff. CONCLUSION: The affection of a single lymph node in the absence of a primary tumour should not automatically lead to the conclusion that it is a single metastasis, but rather a primary melanoma of the lymph nodes, in cases of a negative PET scan, for example. In these cases, the measuring of the tumour thickness should guide the further therapeutic behaviour and determine the approach...|$|E
40|$|Discussion about CEO {{remuneration}} {{has seemed}} to stay current throughout decades. Recently the downturn in economy has again aroused discussions on the CEO's high remuneration levels while companies are in reality performing poorly and public has witnessed series of downsizings and lay-offs. As compensation has traditionally {{been seen as a}} reward for good performance, the witnessed events <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>what</b> are the CEO's actually being paid for. The determinants of CEO remuneration should be looked at a wider perspective as company performance doesn't seem to explain the remuneration levels exhaustively. Previous research has used companies' corporate governance characteristics to look for explanations. In this thesis 117 publically listed Finnish companies are studied to search the determinants of CEO remuneration. The data was hand-collected for the research during the spring 2014 and consists of data from 2013. The main interest {{of this study is to}} estimate the effects of publically listed companies' share ownership structure on CEO remuneration. The study looks into share ownership concentration as well as different ownership typologies to see whether there is a connection with the remuneration levels and use of share based incentives. The results of the study indicate that share ownership concentration is negatively associated with CEO remuneration levels. This suggests that concentrated share ownership results in closer monitoring on CEO performance and less use of monetary incentives. No statistically significant connection was found with shareowner typologies and CEO remuneration levels. Regarding the use of share based incentives, shareowner structure was not found to be statistically significant factor. The results are in some aspects in line with previous findings. Share ownership concentration has been found to lower the pay levels in previous studies. On the contrary we found no statistical significance with the share owner typology variable, which has been recorded before. The categorization into different typologies is quite subjective and with different categorization method the results might change. This could be interesting to study further in the future with Finnish data...|$|E
