5|$|Ancient writers {{believed}} that the worship of Terminus had been introduced to Rome {{during the reign of}} the first king Romulus (traditionally 753717 BC) or his successor Numa (717673 BC). Modern scholars have variously seen it as the survival of an early animistic <b>reverence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> power inherent in the boundary marker, or as the Roman development of proto-Indo-European belief in a god concerned with the division of property.|$|E
5|$|Islamic <b>reverence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> site {{is derived}} from the belief that the prophet Mohammed tied his miraculous steed Buraq nearby during his night journey to Jerusalem. Various places have been {{suggested}} for the exact spot where Buraq was tethered, but for several centuries the preferred location has been the al-Buraq mosque, which is just inside the wall {{at the south end of}} the present Western Wall plaza. The mosque is located above an ancient passageway, which once came out through the long-sealed Barclay's Gate whose huge lintel is still visible directly below the Maghrebi gate.|$|E
5|$|The Empire of Japan endeavored, through {{education}} initiatives and specific {{financial support for}} new shrines, to frame Shinto practice as a patriotic moral tradition. From the early Meiji era, the divine origin of the Emperor was the official position of the state, and taught in classrooms not as myth, but as historical fact. Shinto priests were hired to teach in public schools, and cultivated this teaching, alongside <b>reverence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Emperor and compulsory class trips to shrines. State Shinto practitioners also emphasized the ritual aspect as a traditional civic practice that did not explicitly call on faith to participate.|$|E

5|$|For {{over fifty}} years, the Holy Name Society of Mt. St. Peter Church {{has been working}} to inspire love, honor, and <b>reverence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> holy name of Jesus Christ. The society also works to promote respect for the Catholic Church, loyalty to Mt. St. Peter Parish, and a life filled with good spiritual values that can be carried {{throughout}} family, education, and work. The Holy Name Society is strictly for Catholic men and was begun by Monsignor Fusco, who started the group in hopes of uniting men of the parish through service to others. Members of the society host a Mass and breakfast on the Sunday prior to Palm Sunday every year and an annual Golf Outing during the summer. Money raised at this these two events is donated to the parish to help aid in the costs of parish projects.|$|E
5|$|In Half-Life 2, {{the player}} {{takes on the}} role of Dr. Gordon Freeman. Throughout the game, the player follows the story of a dark, dystopian future in which mankind has been enslaved by the Combine, a mysterious alien enemy. In contrast, Concerned follows the same general path through the story {{established}} by Half-Life 2, but instead follows the adventures of Gordon Frohman, a hapless, lethally clumsy oaf who arrives in City 17 a few weeks before Freeman. Frohman is incredibly naïve and, unlike the other citizens, seems to enjoy living under the rule of the totalitarian administrator, Dr. Breen, and the Combine. He holds an insane <b>reverence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> latter, even going to the point of having a plush doll of a Combine soldier.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{deficiencies}} attending a university education there was, however, {{one good thing}} about it, {{and that was the}} education which the undergraduates gave themselves. It was impossible to collect some thousand or twelve hundred of the best young man in England, to give them the opportunity of making acquaintance with one another, and full liberty to live their lives in their own way, without evolving in the best among them, some admirable qualities of loyalty, independence, and self-control. If the average undergraduate carried from University little or no learning, which was of any service to him, he carried from it a knowledge of men and respect for his fellows and himself, a <b>reverence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> past, a code of honour for the present, which could not but be serviceable. He had enjoyed opportunities... of intercourse with men, some of whom were certain to rise to the highest places in the Senate, in the Church, or at the Bar. He might have mixed with them in his sports, in his studies, and perhaps in his debating society; and any associations which he had this formed had been useful to him at the time, and might be a source of satisfaction to him in after life.|$|E

50|$|It {{would seem}} from the {{evidence}} {{that in spite of}} Philip Skelton’s commendation of Fowler's great regard for religion, his main interests were in family, gardens and with little <b>reverence</b> <b>for</b> antiquities. <b>The</b> garden of the Palace of Tallaght was brought to a high state of perfection.

25|$|There {{are persons}} in every community—often deeply devout—to whom any {{version of the}} Judaeo-Christian Bible is offensive.

25|$|Elijah is revered as {{the spiritual}} Father and {{traditional}} {{founder of the}} Catholic religious Order of Carmelites. In addition to taking their name from Mt. Carmel where the first hermits of the order established themselves, the Calced Carmelite and Discalced Carmelite traditions pertaining to Elijah focus upon the prophet’s withdrawal from public life.

25|$|Christian hymns {{are often}} written with special or {{seasonal}} themes {{and these are}} used on holy days such as Christmas, Easter and the Feast of All Saints, or during particular seasons such as Advent and Lent.

Some hymns praise or address individual saints, particularly the Blessed Virgin Mary; such hymns are particularly prevalent in Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy {{and to some extent}} High Church Anglicanism.|$|E
25|$|Pandit Nilakantha Das {{suggested}} that Jagannath was a deity of Jain origin {{because of the}} appending of Nath to many Jain Tirthankars. He felt Jagannath meant the 'World personified' in the Jain context and was derived from Jinanath. Evidence of the Jain terminology such as of Kaivalya, which means moksha or salvation, {{is found in the}} Jagannath tradition. Similarly, the twenty two steps leading to the temple, called the Baisi Pahacha, have been proposed as symbolic <b>reverence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first 22 of the 24 Tirthankaras of Jainism.|$|E

25|$|The {{swastika}} {{was adopted}} by several organizations in pre–World War I Europe and later, and most notably, by the Nazi Party and Nazi Germany prior to World War II.

In many Western countries, the swastika is viewed as a symbol of racial supremacy and intimidation because of its association with Nazism. The <b>reverence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> swastika symbol, in some cultures in contrast to the stigma in others, has led to misinterpretations, misunderstandings, and mutual accusations.|$|E
25|$|Symbolism was {{a device}} to {{distinguish}} the main features of the Revolution and ensure public identification and support. In order to effectively illustrate {{the differences between the}} new Republic and the old regime, the leaders needed to implement a new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbolism. To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instil in the public a new sense of tradition and <b>reverence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Enlightenment and the Republic.|$|E
25|$|Representative of the 1900–1930 era, was James M. Beck, {{a lawyer}} under Presidents Roosevelt, Harding and Coolidge, and a congressman from 1927–1933.

Conservatives like Beck saw the need to regulate bad behavior {{in the corporate world}} with the intention of protecting corporate capitalism from radical forces, but they were alarmed by the anti-business and pro-union proposals of Roosevelt after 1905. They began to question the notion of a national authority beneficial to big capital, and instead emphasized legalism, concern for the Constitution, and <b>reverence</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> American past.|$|E
