5|$|One of {{the biggest}} current {{challenges}} to wind power grid integration in the United States is the necessity of developing new transmission lines to carry power from wind farms, usually in remote lowly populated states {{in the middle of}} the country due to availability of wind, to high load locations, usually on the coasts where population density is higher. The current transmission lines in remote locations were not designed for the transport of large amounts of energy. As transmission lines become longer the losses associated with power transmission increase, as modes of losses at lower lengths are exacerbated and new modes of losses are no longer negligible as the length is increased, making it harder to transport large loads over large distances. However, resistance from state and local governments makes it difficult to construct new transmission lines. Multi state power transmission projects are discouraged by states with cheap electric power rates for fear that exporting their cheap power will lead to increased rates. A 2005 energy law gave the Energy Department authority to approve transmission projects states refused to act on, but after an attempt to use this authority, the Senate declared the department was being overly aggressive in doing so. Another problem is that wind companies find out after the fact that the transmission capacity of a new farm is below the generation capacity, largely because federal utility rules to encourage renewable energy installation allow feeder lines to meet only minimum standards. These are important issues that need to be solved, as when the transmission capacity does not meet the generation capacity, wind farms are forced to produce below their full potential or stop running all together, in a process known as curtailment. While this leads to potential <b>renewable</b> <b>generation</b> left untapped, it prevents possible grid overload or risk to reliable service.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} <b>renewable</b> distributed <b>generation</b> on the operational characteristics of meshed power distribution systems. Meshed power distribution systems are more reliable than radial and closed-loop ones; however, their structures and operating conditions are {{more complex than the}} latter. Hence, operating these types of systems is not easy for power engineers, {{especially in the case of}} combining <b>renewable</b> distributed <b>generation</b> sources. This paper first develops the constant power model of a <b>renewable</b> distributed <b>generation</b> source, then constructs the network model of a medium-voltage meshed distribution system in the professional simulation software, Matlab/Simulink. The effects of <b>renewable</b> distributed <b>generation</b> sources on the operational characteristics of meshed distribution systems are evaluated in detail. The evaluation takes into account the generation capacity, connecting location, and operating power factor of <b>renewable</b> distributed <b>generation</b> sources. The results shown in this paper can contribute well to electrical utilities with meshed power distribution systems.

25|$|Similar to {{many other}} countries, {{development}} of renewable electricity in Australia has been encouraged by government energy policy implemented in response to concerns about climate change, energy independence and economic stimulus. A key policy {{that has been in}} place since 2001 to encourage large-scale renewable energy development is a mandatory renewable energy target, which in 2010 was increased to 41,000gigawatt-hours of <b>renewable</b> <b>generation</b> from power stations. This was subsequently reduced to 33,000 gigawatt-hours by the Abbott Government with the agreement of the Labor opposition. Alongside this there is the Small-Scale Renewable Energy Scheme, an uncapped scheme to support rooftop solar power and solar hot water and several State schemes providing feed-in tariffs to encourage photovoltaics. In 2012, these policies were supplemented by a carbon price and a 10billion-dollar fund to finance renewable energy projects, although these initiatives were later withdrawn by the Federal Government.|$|E

40|$|The {{integration}} of <b>renewable</b> energy <b>generation</b> into distribution systems {{has a significant}} influence on network power losses, nodal voltage profile and security level due to the variability and uncertainty of <b>renewable</b> energy <b>generation.</b> This paper proposes a novel interval optimization based day-ahead scheduling model considering <b>renewable</b> energy <b>generation</b> uncertainties for distribution management systems. In this approach, the forecasting errors of wind speed, solar radiation intensity and loads are formulated as interval numbers {{so as to avoid}} any need for accurate probability distribution. In this model, the total nodal voltage deviation and network power losses are optimized for the economic operation of distribution systems with improved power quality. Consequently, the order relation of interval numbers is used to transform the proposed interval optimal scheduling model into a deterministic optimization problem which can then be solved using the harmony search algorithm. Simulation results on 33 -node and 119 -node systems with <b>renewable</b> energy <b>generation</b> showed that considerable improvements on system nodal voltage profile and power losses can be achieved with multiple interval sources of uncertain <b>renewable</b> energy <b>generation</b> and loads.

2500|$|A 2016 thesis {{finds that}} two broad {{coalition}} of actors {{faced each other}} off over {{the development of the}} EEG legislation: an 'economic coalition' that opposed support for renewables and sought to protect nuclear power and fossil fuel interests and an 'environmental coalition' that took the opposite stance. [...] The economic coalition wanted unassisted market competition to prevail and preferred large-scale facilities. [...] The environmental coalition comprised environmental organizations, the renewables industry, farmers, the metal workers unions (IGBCE and IG Metall), a German engineering association (VDMA), partly the [...] (ZDH), and some industrial corporations with renewables interests. [...] When the EEG was proposed in the late-1990s, the incumbent energy companies markedly underestimated the technological potential of renewables, believing them to be suitable only for niche roles. [...] They were not alone, almost all politicians and scientists of the time did so too. [...] The opposition to the EEG was therefore muted. [...] Concurrent lobbying over the nuclear phase-out (Atomausstieg) also diverted industry attention away from the EEG negotiations. [...] Notwithstanding, the success of the EEG can be traced a small dedicated group of parliamentarians who forged an alliance between various business groups, unions, environmental NGOs, and other idealistic interest groups. [...] Yet despite expectations, <b>renewable</b> <b>generation</b> came to account for 27.4% of gross electricity consumption in 2014 and seriously threatened the business model of the incumbents.

[...] Free-standing photovoltaic systems on nature conservation areas were excluded from remuneration. [...] The tariff structure for onshore wind was basically maintained, but the degression was tightened from 1% to 1.5% to incentivize efficiency improvements. [...] The system services bonus for onshore wind was extended and the repowering bonus was improved. [...] Offshore wind gained through improved early starter provisions. [...] The start of the degression was postponed until 2018, but increased from 5% to 7%. [...] Starter tariffs were increased but now last 8 rather than 12years. [...] Biomass tariffs were lowered by 10–15% on average, particularly for small systems. [...] The biomass tariff system itself was greatly simplified, with now four size categories and two fuel categories. [...] The degression for biomass was increased from 1% to 2%. [...] The tariffs for hydroelectricity were simplified, the funding period now uniformly 20years, and the degression rate set at 1%. [...] The tariffs for geothermal energy were raised and the start of the degression postponed until 2018, albeit at an increased rate.

The cooperative framework considers the self-interested behaviors of microgrids, and incorporates both their long-term investment costs and short-term operational costs over the planning horizon. Specifically, interconnected microgrids jointly decide where and how much to deploy <b>renewable</b> energy <b>generations,</b> and how to split the associated investment cost.
