5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a <b>religious</b> <b>belief,</b> a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against <b>religious</b> <b>belief.</b>|$|E

At the same time, he remarked on Ramanujan's strict vegetarianism.|$|E
5|$|In his {{biography}} of Hick, David Cheetham notes {{a criticism of}} Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> provisional, preventing total commitment to faith. Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued that religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} suggests that clients' <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> are commonly excluded from therapeutic practice. Often, this exclusion is attributed to practitioners' lack of knowledge or appropriate skills. Such analyses, however, have little regard for the interactional aspects of the therapist/client encounter. Drawing upon work within discursive social psychology, we argue that the exclusion of <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> does not reflect therapists' lack of knowledge or awareness but can more usefully {{be seen as the}} discursive accomplishment of marginalizing clients' beliefs. Six practising psychotherapists were interviewed about <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> within the therapeutic process. Participants construct <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> as important but relevant only to restricted categories of clients. They rework <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> as compatible with accepted practice, or construct particular groups of clients as incompatible with the process. Training and other requirements are reformulated in terms of spiritual <b>beliefs</b> rather than <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs.</b> These constructions display awareness of <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> while marginalizing their relevance in practice. Inclusion of clients' <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> to best effect will require more psychotherapy to engage more constructively with religion than it does at present...|$|R

5|$|Prosperity {{theology}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the prosperity gospel, the health and wealth gospel, or the gospel of success) is a <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> among some Christians, who hold that financial blessing and physical well-being are always the will of God for them, and that faith, positive speech, and donations to religious causes will increase one's material wealth. Prosperity theology views the Bible as a contract between God and humans: if humans have faith in God, he will deliver security and prosperity.|$|E

In 1965, a presidential decree required every Indonesian citizen {{to belong to}} one of five officially recognised religions: Islam, Christianity (Protestantism and Catholicism), Hinduism, or Buddhism. The Torajan <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> (aluk) was not legally recognised, and the Torajans raised their voices against the law. To make aluk accord with the law, {{it had to be}} accepted as part of one of the official religions. In 1969, Aluk To Dolo ("the way of ancestors") was legalised as a sect of Agama Hindu Dharma, the official name of Hinduism in Indonesia.|$|E

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how clinicians make sense of Muslim <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> when the client may have {{psychotic}} symptoms. Limited literature suggests that psychiatrists draw on a Western empiricist epistemology and implicit cultural norms in utilising the DSM’s diagnostic criteria. Concerns have been raised that practitioners can overlook <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> and pathologise <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> from non-Western cultures. No research has specifically explored psychiatrists’ understanding of <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs.</b> This research aimed to explore how psychiatrists understand Islamic <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> when assessing clients referred with possible psychotic symptoms. It also hoped to explore how they understand {{the impact of their}} views on subsequent assessment decisions. Interviews were conducted with five psychiatrists and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. In contrast to expectations, the participants did not view their understanding of <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> as central to their assessment decisions. Service pressures and psychiatrists’ sense of accountability for clients appeared to inform the emphasis of psychiatric assessments; risk assessments and case management decisions were prioritised above all else. This appeared to limit the participants’ opportunity to engage with clients’ <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs,</b> to fully understand their presentations or to make fluid assessment decisions they felt were often appropriate. Participants also demonstrated a more intricate, nuanced understanding of <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> than previous literature has suggested. In keeping with best practice guidelines participants viewed <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> as a normal manifestation of a person’s culture and existing on a continuum. The participants showed an awareness of the impact of their cultural position on their understanding of <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs.</b> However, their understanding remains embedded within a psychiatric framework informed by the secular, empirical, bio-medical paradigm of the DSM. This provides an important insight into some of the barriers between mental health services and Muslim clients who present with <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs...</b>|$|R
40|$|What is the {{relationship}} between subjective well-being (SWB) and the strength of <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs?</b> A full account of {{the relationship}} between SWB and religion must include a measure of the effects of <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Unfortunately, the empirical happiness literature focuses on the effects of the social aspects of religious life. I measured the effects of the strength of <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> by using data on the frequency of prayer. I found that stronger <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> are positively correlated with SWB. According to the happiness literature, religion influences SWB by providing meaning and purpose to people 2 ̆ 7 s lives; stronger <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> reflect a stronger influence of religion when interpreting life events. 1 Studying the social aspects of religion gives only a partial understanding of its relationship to SWB; it is important study the role of <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> to get a more complete understanding of religion‟s effects on well-being...|$|R

40|$|In {{contemporary}} {{debates in}} religious epistemology, theistic philosophers provide differing {{responses to the}} evidentialist argument against <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Plantinga’s strategy is to argue that evidence is not needed to justify <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> while Swinburne’s strategy is to argue that <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> can be justified by evidence. However, in Aquinas’ account of religious epistemology, he seems to employ both strategies. In his account of religious knowledge by faith, he argues that evidence is unnecessary for <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs.</b> But in his account of religious knowledge by science, he argues that there is evidence for <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs.</b> In this paper, I {{argue that there is}} no real dichotomy between Plantinga’s and Swinburne’s responses to the evidentialist argument.

However, several scholars who have researched Wallace's views in depth have emphasised that, for him, spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than <b>religious</b> <b>belief.</b> Among other prominent 19th-century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer Robert Owen, who was one of Wallace's early idols, the physicists William Crookes and Lord Rayleigh, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan, and the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers.|$|E

The French lodges took their lead from the Grand Orient de France in not requiring any <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> in their members. Besant, with the blessing of Paris, followed the lead of the United Grand Lodge of England in requiring initiates to believe in a supreme being.

5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued {{that he could not}} have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge based on the principle that, in so far as assertions of <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{knowledge}} of Egyptian {{beliefs about the}} gods is mostly drawn from religious writings produced by the nation's scribes and priests. These people were the elite of Egyptian society and were very distinct from the general populace, {{most of whom were}} illiterate. Little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed. Commoners' perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests. The populace may, for example, have mistaken the religion's symbolic statements about the gods and their actions for literal truth. But overall, what little is known about popular <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> is consistent with the elite tradition. The two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of the gods and their nature.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{language}} is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity. This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness is unique and cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises {{the problem of how}} (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all, which causes problems for <b>religious</b> <b>belief</b> since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life. The French philosopher Simone Weil expressed this problem in her work Waiting for God, in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} {{between religion and}} the self has long been discussed. The current project specifically examines the way <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> relate to the feeling that people know their true selves.

To test this idea, an experiment was conducted that manipulated people?s confidence in their <b>religious</b> <b>beliefs</b> and then assessed their perceived true self-knowledge.
