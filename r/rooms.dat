5|$|Montacute, {{like many}} Elizabethan mansions, is built in an 'E' shape, a much-used plan in this era. On {{the ground floor}} was the great hall, kitchens and pantries, on the upper floors, {{retiring}} <b>rooms</b> for the family and honoured guests. Over the centuries, the layout and use of <b>rooms</b> changed: drawing and dining <b>rooms</b> evolved on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Starting with {{an empty}} hospital, the player must build <b>rooms</b> and hire doctors, nurses, {{handymen}} and receptionists. Each staff member has statistics that affect their performance, and doctors can be trained so their statistics will increase. <b>Rooms</b> include GP's Offices, Psychiatric <b>rooms,</b> Operating Theatres and Pharmacies, and are built by placing down a blueprint, assigning the location of doors and windows, and then placing down required and optional pieces of furniture. The player may also set up items such as benches, fire extinguishers, and plants in the open corridor spaces provided. The player is given time to build the hospital {{at the start of}} each level before patients start coming. Patients see a GP in his office who either provides a diagnosis or sends them for further evaluation in a specialised diagnosis room. Once a diagnosis is made, the patient will be sent for treatment. While a few <b>rooms</b> are available {{at the start of the}} game, the rest must be researched. Some <b>rooms,</b> such as the Inflator room—where patients with Bloaty Head are treated—contain machines which require regular maintenance by a handyman: if neglected for too long, they will explode, killing all occupants of the room. Doctors must have acquired certain specialist skills to practise in certain <b>rooms,</b> such as the Research room (used to research new <b>rooms</b> and cures, and improve existing ones) and Operating Theatre. There are <b>rooms</b> that only staff use, such as the Staff Room and the Research room, while patients also require certain <b>rooms</b> such as toilet facilities.|$|E

5|$|The John Deere House {{was built}} in 1836 when Deere arrived in Grand Detour and the {{building}} was added onto as his family grew. It is furnished with period furniture and household objects {{that would have been}} common around the time the Deere family occupied the home. The house has two levels with four <b>rooms</b> on the main level and two <b>rooms</b> upstairs. Each of the upstairs <b>rooms</b> is accessible via a private staircase and it is believed one of the <b>rooms</b> was used by Deere's apprentices while the other was used as a children's bedroom.|$|E

This apartment was placed slightly lower than the level of Bankova Street, from the front entrance.|$|E
5|$|The {{basement}} {{consists of}} an arcade of cloisters on three sides, surrounding several vaulted <b>rooms</b> including the sacristy, chapter house and warming house. These <b>rooms</b> were situated under the original dormitory. At {{the other end of}} the building, below what was formerly the abbess' chambers and the great hall, are two <b>rooms</b> and the main passage. On the north side, underneath the original refectory, is the undercroft.|$|E

5|$|The {{east and}} west wings of the {{building}} once each contained a transit room. Each of the <b>rooms</b> had a mounted transit telescope on a brick pier; the piers are still visible in the basement below the transit <b>rooms.</b> The western transit <b>rooms</b> were converted into office space by the 1920s. The eastern transit <b>rooms</b> were converted to office space more recently.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the hall is opulently, but {{by the standards of}} the day, simply decorated and furnished. Ornament is used with such restraint that it was possible to decorate both private and state <b>rooms</b> in the same style, without oppressing the former. The principal entrance is through the Marble Hall, which is in fact made of pink Derbyshire alabaster; this leads to the piano nobile, or the first floor, and state <b>rooms.</b> The most impressive of these <b>rooms</b> is the Saloon, which has walls lined with red velvet. Each of the major state <b>rooms</b> is symmetrical in its layout and design; in some <b>rooms,</b> false doors are necessary to fully achieve this balanced effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} <b>rooms</b> on both {{ground and}} first floors feature oak panelling; {{that in one}} of the upper rear <b>rooms</b> is Elizabethan. This room also features a fine carved overmantel with a woven love knot and central heart; the ground floor room {{to the right of the}} hall contains a further good example of a carved overmantel.

The Chagall was established in the 1950s and has reproductions of Marc Chagall paintings in the <b>rooms.</b> Radisson Blu Limfjord Hotel, operated by the Radisson Hotels chain, contains 188 <b>rooms</b> and has the Italian restaurant Vero Gusto. The Park Hotel, opposite the railway station, was established in 1917. Other hotels include Cabinn Aalborg, Hotel Hvide Hus, Hotel Krogen and Prinsen Hotel. Several banks including Danske Bank, Forex, Jyske Bank, Spar Nord and Nordea have branches in Aalborg.|$|E
5|$|After its closure in 1917, the bay {{platform}} {{was converted}} into <b>rooms</b> for use, at various times, as offices, air-raid shelters, store <b>rooms,</b> an electrical sub-station and a war-time hostel.
