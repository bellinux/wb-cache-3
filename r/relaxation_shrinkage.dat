40|$|Fabric woven from wool/polyester (PES) Murata vortex spun (MVS) blend yarn is {{a commercially}} viable {{proposition}} {{particularly on the}} basis of advantageous wear-resistant properties, compared with fabric made from traditional worsted ring-spun yarn. However, in some early industrial trials with fabric made from 45 / 55 -blend wool/PES MVS yarn, significantly greater <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage</b> was found relative to comparable worsted ring-spun fabric. It was noted {{at the time that the}} amount of <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage</b> in MVS fabric could be reduced to a large extent by using steamed MVS yarn. In this study, the extent of variations in the dimensional and mechanical properties of fabric samples woven from a combination of steamed and unsteamed MVS yarn and equivalent worsted ring-spun yarn is examined. In general, greater hygral expansion and <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage</b> were found in loom-state fabrics made from unsteamed MVS yarns, whereas the fabric made from steamed MVS and ring-spun yarns gave relatively low levels of <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and hygral expansion. Permanent setting of fabrics, by pressure steaming, was found to be more effective than yarn pre-steaming in reducing <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage</b> levels of fabrics made from unsteamed MVS yarn. After pressure steaming, all fabrics showed similar levels of <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and hygral expansion. Permanent setting of the fabrics, by pressure steaming, resulted in similar levels of <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and hygral expansion, irrespective of the yarn production method; <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage</b> fell to around 1 % and hygral expansion increased by about 1 %, relative to the loom-state samples. MVS fabrics were relatively heavier and fuller and had a firmer handle than the worsted ring-spun fabrics, reflecting the greater fabric weight, thickness and shear rigidity measured on these fabrics. These attributes are associated with different structures of the worsted ring-spun and MVS yarns used to make the fabrics. <br /...|$|E

40|$|It {{is shown}} that tension applied to fabric {{which is then}} {{permanently}} set by steaming under pressure {{for a short time}} has a significant effect on fabric dimensional properties. Increasing levels of stretch applied to fabric before pressure steaming resulted in decreases in fabric hygral expansion and <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and also lowered fabric shrinkage that resulted from permanent setting. The setting conditions resembled those used in conventional pressure decatising, and it is suggested that in batch decatising, precise control of the length and width of fabric as it is batched up with the wrapper before steaming under pressure could enable predictable changes in fabric dimensions, <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage</b> and hygral expansion to be obtained. <br /...|$|E

According to these studies, wettability and capillarity of fabrics can be significantly improved depending on the process gas used. In the present study, the effects of low pressure O 2 - and NH 3 - plasma on the morphology and topometry of fabrics on four different length scales, as well as the influence of the topographical changes of textile structures on the resulting water spreading and absorption rates were investigated. The results of the topographic characterisation using two non-contact optical methods and wettability measurements indicate that the modification of filament nano-topography cannot satisfactorily explain the drastic changes observed in wettability. Dimensional changes (<b>relaxation</b> and <b>shrinkage)</b> as well as changes in warp morphology and inter-yarn spaces are more decisive for inducing hydrophilicity in polyester woven plain fabrics than an increase in the surface nano-roughness of their filaments...|$|R
40|$|Objectives. On {{the basis}} of the experimental, {{theoretical}} and field studies, an engineering calculation method was developed for assessing the cracking resistance of external enclosing constructions made of cellular concrete, with the maximum gradient development of moisture and carbonisation forced deformations along their thickness, taking into account the <b>relaxation</b> of the <b>shrinkage</b> stresses. In this regard, the aim of the work is to provide technological measures at the manufacturing stage in order to increase the operational cracking resistance of the construction's outer surface layers by reducing the moisture and carbonation shrinkage of cellular concrete by introducing a large or fine porous aggregate in calculated amounts. Methods. A number of analytical equations were applied to establish the dependence of the shrinkage of heavy concrete of conventional hardness on the amount of aggregate introduced and its elasticity modulus, water-cement ratio and cement consumption, as well as the concrete's moisture content. Results. Knowing the volumes of the structural aggregate and the cellular concrete mass, as well as their modulus of elasticity, the shrinkage reduction factor of the cellular concrete was calculated {{with the addition of a}} lightweight porous aggregate. Subsequently, the shrinkage deformations of concrete in the surface layer of the outer enclosing construction, maximising crack resistance due to moisture exchange and carbonation influences under operating conditions, were defined, taking into account the relaxation of tensile stresses due to creep of concrete. Conclusion. Theoretical calculations, based on the recommended method of assessing the cracking resistance of cellular concrete enclosing constructions under moisture exchange and carbonisation processes, taking into account the <b>relaxation</b> of <b>shrinkage</b> stresses, showed that in order to exclude the appearance of cracks in wall panels 280 mm thick made of 700 kg/m 3 gas ash concrete with elasticity modulus of 2500 MPa, it is necessary to have 70 - 80 % of keramzite or granulated slag, and 50 - 60 % of stone crumb (granite or marble crushed stone) of the volume of cellular concrete in the surface layer of 30 - 50 mm.  </p...|$|R

At around pH 4. 8, which is close to the isoelectric point of wool, the hygral expansion reaches its greatest value and drops at both lower and higher pHs. A similar relationship between pH and extensibility of wool fabric was observed. Values of <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage</b> were found to be dependant on pH.

30|$|It {{can also}} be seen from Table  1 that {{cellulase}} treatment by washing of the denim garments with cellulase at 0.5 % concentration caused increase in GSM (fabric weight) of the garments, whereas weight loss (GSM decreased) results have previously been obtained with direct and reactive dyed cotton fabric substrate. During weaving, cotton fabrics are subjected to considerable tensions, particularly in the warp direction. In subsequent finishing processes, such as calendaring this stretch is increased and temporarily set in the fabric. The fabric is then in a state of dimensional instability (Cookson 1992). Subsequently when the denim garment was thoroughly wetted in enzyme washing, it tended to revert its more stable dimensions which results in the contraction of the yarns. This effect is usually greater in the warp direction than in the weft direction. This is known as <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage.</b> Due to <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage,</b> PPI (picks per inch) is higher in treated, compared to untreated denim garments. As a result, fabric GSM is increased at different cellulase concentrations and 2 % cellulase concentration is optimum result (Table  1). Although hydrolysis occurred in cellulase washing, at the same time <b>relaxation</b> <b>shrinkage</b> occurred, and the GSM (fabric weight) of denim garments increased slightly. But the use of higher concentrations of cellulase (3.5 %) brought losses in fabric weight due to more hydrolysis of cellulose. It was observed that 2 % concentration of cellulase results in the maximum increase in fabric weight, compared to the other concentrations.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} years the media have {{highlighted}} the damage {{of the ozone layer}} and the resulting increase of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) reaching the earth’s surface. Prolonged and repeated, both occupational and recreational, sun exposure of the population causes some detrimental effects. Clothing is considered {{to be one of the}} most important tools for UV protection. It is generally accepted that synthetic fibres provide a high UV protection capability of textiles, while cellulose fibres (cotton, linen, hemp, viscose) have a low UV absorption capacity. However, natural pigments, pectin and waxes in natural cellulose fibers, and lignin in hemp fibers, act as UV absorbers having a favorable effect on UPF of grey-state fabrics. Bearing in mind the trend of reintroduction of hemp fibers as a source of eco-friendly textiles, there is a serious lack of study about the potential of hemp materials in terms of UV protection. Folded yarn is a complex yarn composed of two or more component yarns arranged parallel and twisted together to make a “new quality” yarn. Folding of yarns is an operation undertaken in order to modify single-yarn properties to an appreciable degree. There are very few investigations concerning the relationship between the yarn properties and UV protection effectiveness of the fabric made there from. In addition, there is no any result in the scientific literature about the influence of yarn folding on UV protection properties of textile materials. Having this in mind, for our research the idea was to evaluate the effect of yarn folding in this regard. The plain knitted fabrics composed of single or two-folded hemp yarn were compared in terms of UV protection properties. The Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF), as the quantitative measurement of the material effectiveness to protect the human skin against UVR, was determined for the textile materials by in vitro test method according to the European standard EN 13758. The knitted fabrics construction and physical properties were also determined. Bearing in mind that plain knitted fabrics are particularly susceptible to relaxation, they were subjected to <b>relaxation</b> and <b>shrinkage</b> by wetting process, and testing procedure was repeated on the water-treated samples. The results obtained indicated that the folding operation influences UV protection properties of knitted fabrics through an influence on a loop configuration, i. e. the fabric openness. <b>Relaxation</b> and <b>shrinkage</b> of the knitted fabrics due to wet relaxation caused the reduction of macro-porosity increasing the UPF of the knitted fabrics. Although the knitted fabric produced from single hemp yarn was characterized by higher UPF, the UVR transmittance of the folded hemp yarn knitted fabric after wet relaxation placed it in the “excellent UV protection category” (according to European Standard EN 13758 - 2). This fact together with the better thermal comfort manifested itself in higher air permeability, confirmed the potential of folding operation in terms of UV protection properties of textile materials...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} analyse 3 D growing {{concrete}} structures {{taking into account}} the phenomenon of body accretion, necessary for the simulation of the construction sequence, and carbon dioxide attack. Design/methodology/approach – A typical 3 D segmental bridge made of precast concrete is studied through a fully coupled thermo-hygro-mechanical F. E. model. The durability of the bridge is evaluated and carbonation effects are considered. Creep, <b>relaxation</b> and <b>shrinkage</b> effects are included according to the theory developed in the 1970 s by Bažant for concretes and geomaterials; the fluid phases are considered as a unique mixture which interacts with a solid phase. The porous material is modelled using n Maxwell elements in parallel (Maxwell-chain model). Findings – First, calibration analyses are developed to check the VISCO 3 D model capabilities for predicting carbonation phenomena within concrete and the full 3 D structure is modelled to further assess the durability of the bridge under severe conditions of CO 2 attack. Originality/value – The adopted numerical model accounts for the strong coupling mechanisms of CO 2 diffusion in the gas phase, moisture and heat transfer, CaCO 3 formation and the availability of Ca(OH) 2 in the pore solution due to its transport by water movement. Additionally, the phenomenon of a sequential construction is studied and numerically reproduced by a sequence of “births” for the 3 D finite elements discretizing the bridge. The fully coupled model is here extended to 3 D problems for accreting bodies (as segmental bridges) in order to gather the effects of multi-dimensional attacks of carbon dioxide for such structures...|$|R

The use of the introduced method for the purposes of service life estimation is also presented in case of a long-span, pre-cast, pre-stressed concrete beam. Initial stochastic parameters of material properties and structural geometry were derived from destructive material tests and geometry measurements on appropriate beams.

40|$|In {{order to}} manage the full {{lifecycle}} of bridges effectively, {{it is necessary to}} grasp reasons that may possible damage bridge members. Pre-stressed beams are broadly applied in the urban, railway and highway bridges. During the design process, prestress forces are decided through existing norms or theoretical formula. Within their serviceability life, after the construction, many factors such as <b>relaxation</b> of tendons, <b>shrinkage</b> and creep of concrete, friction between tendons and tendon ducts, anchorage slip and ambient temperature can lead to the change of the applied pre-stress forces. So, in order to control the status of pre-stressed bridges, the identification of prestress force is inevitable. This study conducted the prestress force identification by using displacements measured after applying a vertical load in the mid-span of the beam. The identification of prestress force can be made on pre-stressed steel box beam and pre-stressed concrete beam, respectively. Post-tensioning method is considered during the experimental tests. Axial force, which is prestress force, can be estimated by using displacements measured in certain sections and the formula of axial buckling load.

40|$|Concrete {{pavements}} {{and structures}} {{are especially vulnerable}} to cracking at early age. The volumetric instability of concrete at early age is a frequent cause of cracking. The primary components of volume change are external drying shrinkage, autogenous shrinkage, and thermal dilation. When concrete is restrained, tensile stress develops due to shrinkage and increases the probability of cracking. Early age properties, such as tensile creep, are not well understood {{and the availability of}} literature on the subject is limited. The goal of this research is to improve the understanding of early age behavior in emerging materials in order to improve long term durability. The early age volume changes of self-consolidating concrete (SCC), high-performance concrete (HPC), and concrete with shrinkage reducing admixture (SRA), or shrinkage-reduced concrete (SRC) were studied in order to understand mechanical behavior and develop guidelines for practice. A restrained uniaxial testing frame was previously developed for the purposes of understanding of early age mechanical properties and it was used to explore the role of tensile creep for <b>relaxation</b> of <b>shrinkage</b> stress in materials that are outside the scope of many current prediction models and design guidelines. Tensile creep was compared to compressive creep and up to a tenfold increase was observed, indicating an urgent need for updating models. Other observations, such as non-linearity of creep at early age and under restrained conditions, led to new insights regarding the use of superposition for long term deformations. Experimental characterization of early age behavior aided {{the development of a new}} modeling approach based on the utilization of relative humidity (RH) as the driving force for shrinkage. This approach was validated using new experiments developed to characterize tensile creep and autogenous shrinkage, and results demonstrate that RH is a powerful parameter for modeling shrinkage stress development and drying gradients. Based on the experimental work and modeling efforts, practical guidelines were developed for specifications, mixture proportioning, and acceptance testing, and mitigation strategies were suggested to minimize the potential for shrinkage cracking. Improvements were also suggested for existing prediction models to account for early age behavior.

40|$|Pre-stressed beams are broadly {{applied in}} the highway, urban and railway bridges. In design process of these beams, the {{pre-stress}} forces are determined according to the current standards and theoretical formulas but, during the serviceability service life of a bridge, many factors such as <b>relaxation</b> of steel, <b>shrinkage,</b> creep of concrete and ambient temperature {{can lead to the}} change of the applied pre-stress forces. Therefore, in order to effectively control the operating state and the bearing capacity of bridges, {{it is very important to}} identify the pre-stress losses. The proposed method is the extension of the Simplified Formula of Galef [Galef, 1968] to generic pre-stressed bridge beams for the identification of their pre-stress forces. The procedure is suitable for any slender simply-supported beam of any bridge. Making use of the first natural frequencies of the unloaded and loaded beam under investigation, the Simplified Formula is able to estimate the pre-stress force, knowing the respective buckling load. Most of the existing dynamic methods are particularly sensitive to experimental and model errors in which it is also difficult to select a-priori the best natural frequency that will estimate the pre-stress force. In fact, different natural frequencies values lead different precisions in the estimations. The proposed procedure does not require any selection of the best mode shape to be used in the identification process. Numerical tests on two post-tensioned concrete and steel beams confirm the robustness of the non-destructive method even in the presence of moderate parameter errors...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Prestress loss {{adversely}} {{affects the}} behavior of in-service post-tensioned struc-tures in terms of deflection/camber, cracking, and ultimate capacity. It is thus important to determine the level of prestressing force at various loading stages from the initial prestressing force transfer to the structure, through different in-service loads, to the ultimate load of the structure. Prestress loss is difficult to evaluate due to several intertwined factors such as creep, <b>shrinkage,</b> <b>relaxation,</b> geometric configuration, distributed friction, and slippage of post-tensioned strands. Till date, there is no cost-effective and reliable sensor and installation technique for the long-term monitoring and evaluation of prestress loss. In this study, a smart fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) rebar with an embedded novel optical fiber (OF) is developed for the distributed strain of post-tensioned strands. The new OF is an integrated global and local monitoring technology developed by combining the Brillouin optical time domain ana-lysis/refectory sensor and the optical fiber Bragg grating into one single fiber. The FRP rebar and six steel wires were bundled {{together to form a}} seven-wire steel strand for the post-tensioning and monitoring of concrete structures. The performances of the smart rebar and strand were validated with static tests of a prestressed steel frame structure and a post-tensioned concrete beam. The smart steel strand can accurately measure the prestress loss at each loading stage, which agrees well with that measured by a pressure loading cell and predicted by a design code.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. A new procedure is described for design of flat-slab post- tensioned highway bridges. The goal is to provide a rational, sophisticated, and yet relatively facile method of design for this complex class of structures. One-dimensional strip analysis provides an estimated slab thickness, amount of steel reinforcement, and required longitudinal post- tensioning force. After adequate transverse post-tensioning is provided for dead load, finite element analysis computes deflections, strains, and stresses for both short- and long- term dead loads of the plate structure. The slab thickness is decreased in an iterative manner until deflections and stress levels are determined to be within an acceptable range of their target level. Several critical live load cases are applied to the slab and salient quantities are again checked for exceedence of specified bounds. A recommended approach for design of flat slab bridges is presented as a result of extensive experimental and analytical research. An example of a threespan bridge illustrates the design procedure. Details of calculations and -input preparation for the finite element code are included for this bridge. Results are compared with an actual bridge that has been constructed and monitored in the field for more than two years.

40|$|With the aim {{to avoid}} {{possible}} damages of bridges, {{it is necessary}} to ensure the safety conditions of the bridge beams during their full lifecycle. Prestressed concrete members are mainly applied in the highway, urban and railway bridges. During their design process, prestress forces are calculated based on existing standard and theoretical formulas, but during their serviceability life, many factors such as <b>relaxation</b> of tendons, <b>shrinkage</b> and creep of concrete, friction between tendons and tendon ducts, anchorage slip and ambient temperature can lead to the prestress losses. In order to effectively control the status and the bearing capacity of bridges, the prediction of the prestress losses is unavoidable. This work has mostly conducted the prestress load identifications by using fiber Bragg grating-differential settlement measurement (FBG-DSM) technology. In detail, the FBG-DSM monitoring system was used for the short-term deflection measurements along the axis of the post-tensioned beams under examination, after the application of an additional vertical load at their midspan. The utilized static method is in fact able to determine the prestress force and, consequently, the prestress loss making use of one or more vertical displacements. Laboratory tests on a post-tensioned concrete specimen and field tests on No. 24 bridge in Tainan (Taiwan) show the high accuracy of the deflections measured with FBG-DSM sensors, confirming additionally the potential of this new technology. With regards to the static method, the prestress load estimations require an accurate assumption of the beam end restraints and, moreover, an accurate identification of the beam flexural rigidity. In general, good prestress force detections are obtained when significant second-order effects are induced in the tests.

40|$|The {{need for}} {{effective}} and comprehensive repair techniques is increasing {{throughout the world}} as existing concrete structures continue to age. The bonded concrete overlay method, where a new repair material layer is cast over an existing damaged substrate, is the most commonly utilized method of repair. However, this repair technique is prone to failure due to differential volume changes between the newly cast repair material and the existing substrate. These volume changes {{can be attributed to}} thermal and shrinkage differences, with drying shrinkage being identified as they key source of the volume change. When the resulting induced stress form the differential volume changes exceeds the intrinsic tensile strength of the repair material, cracking failure occurs. This can be detrimental to the effectiveness of the repair and its durability. Overlay crack resistance {{has been found to be}} dependent on specific material properties, namely: tensile strength, elastic modulus and shrinkage. The effect of tensile relaxation on overlay performance is also significant, with the resulting 'stress relief' cause by this relaxation prolonging the time to cracking failure. In this investigation, the influence of the inclusion of coarse aggregate in the repair material is investigated. The study focuses on the specific impact of coarse aggregate volume content and size on the performance of bonded overlay materials, and the material properties that influence this performance. Two laboratory concrete mixes, with a w:c = 0. 45 and 0. 6, and a commercial repair product were tested with varying coarse aggregate volume contents. Further testing was conducted with w:c = 0. 6 laboratory mixes with different nominal sized coarse aggregates.

In this study, the mechanics of bone at four different material levels namely: (1) the atomic level (mineral crystal phase); (2) the nano level (collagen fibrils); (3) the micro level (lamellar structure); and (4) the macroscopic level (cortical bone) and their inter-relationship are investigated. Combined wide-angle X-ray diffraction and small-angle X-ray scattering were used together with an in-situ mechanical test to investigate (1) the deformation and (2) relaxation processes of bone. Bone is stiff and tough structure. Partial failure in the nanostructures is found at 0. 2 % macroscopic strain and changes the macroscopic stiffness. Anisotropy and the microstructure of bone dominate the post-yield deformation process, either by sliding between the lamellar layers or by the growth of microcracks. The accumulation of microcracks, observed using microscopy, eventually leads to failure, and results in a rough fracture surface. Bone displays viscoelastic behaviour. During stress relaxation, strain relaxation was observed in both the mineral phase and collagen fibrils. This relaxation process involves a combination of mechanical events and drying, and has distinctive fast and slow relaxation stages. Strain relaxation is fastest at the plane of maximum shear stress at the early stage of <b>relaxation.</b> Drying introduces <b>shrinkage</b> in the bone structure and is found to speed up strain recovery in the lateral direction. Anisotropy in bone is evident in strain relaxation pattern and drying rates. Similarly, at the sub-micron material level, modulus and hardness of bone {{were found to be}} sensitive to loading rates upon nanoindentation. Different indenter sizes introduce different stress levels. At low and high stress levels, deformation is governed by elastic and plastic deformation, respectively. A viscous-elastic-plastic (VEP) mechanical model was developed to describe the deformation processes under spherical indentation. Subsurface cross-sectional imaging of the indents using transmission electron microscopy revealed extrinsic toughening of bone by non-symmetrical crack propagation along fibre boundaries and crack bridging.
