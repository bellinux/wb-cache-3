40|$|Markov Models are of {{outstanding}} {{importance in the}} performance and reliability evaluation of computer systems and communication networks. In this paper we aim at contributing {{to the field of}} Markovian Process Algebras (MPAs). An MPA model is (or may be) the composition of several concurrent sub-components (each of which describes an underlying Markov chain) which may interact with each other through synchronisation. On the one hand the existence of sub-components implies the possibility of the state space explosion problem, i. e. the size of the state space of the Markov chain underlying the composite component grows exponentially in the number of sub-components. On the other hand the interaction of sub-components in general negates the property of independence of their underlying Markov chains, and hence forbids a product-form solution for steady state probabilities. Our target quantities are single steady state probabilities of the Markov chain underlying the composite component. We consider composite components which possess only global synchronisations, i. e. every sub-component is involved in every synchronisation. For this class of MPA models the behaviour of the composite component between two successive synchronisations can be described by the joint process of several absorbing Markov chains. First, a new result on cumulative measures of absorbing <b>joint</b> Markov <b>chains</b> is presented. We compute the mean time to absorption and the mean time the <b>joint</b> Markov <b>chain</b> spends in a certain set before absorption. Our computations do not operate on the state space of the <b>joint</b> Markov <b>chain,</b> and hence the problem of state space explosion is avoided. The computational effort of our method rather depends on convergence properties of the <b>joint</b> Markov <b>chain.</b> Afterwards, this result is applied to compute steady state probabilities for a class of composite components specified as PEPA models which are popular ambassadors of MPAs.

Typically, ST involves introducing an auxiliary variable k taking values in a finite subset of [0, 1] and indexing {{a set of}} tempered distributions, say π_k(θ) ∝π(θ) ^k. In this case, small values of k encourage better mixing, but samples from π are only obtained when the <b>joint</b> <b>chain</b> for (θ,k) reaches k= 1.

In this study, an encapsulation process based on emulsification and requiring only food grade components was used to protect wild-type Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and three of its surface mutants into dairy matrices. The mechanism of microencapsulation was studied {{at the molecular level}} by comparing the encapsulation efficiency of LGG wild type and three of its surface mutants with Atomic Force Microscopy. A significant decrease in the encapsulation efficiency was observed when the bacteria were depleted for pili, while the pilus also appeared to be crucial for location of LGG inside the microparticle. Hereto, the spaCBA mutant lacking pili), the welE mutant lacking long exopolysaccharides) and the dltD mutant having modified lipoteichoic acids were used. Atomic Force Microscopy enabled the confirmation of specific interactions between bacteria and whey proteins, in contrast to the observed nonspecific interactions with rnicellar casein.

The extensible Freely <b>Jointed</b> <b>Chain</b> (FJC) model is frequently invoked to explain the observed behavior of single-stranded DNA. We demonstrate that this model does not satisfactorily describe recent high-force stretching data. We instead propose a model (the Discrete Persistent Chain, or ``DPC'') that borrows features from both the FJC and the Wormlike Chain, and show that it resembles the data more closely. We find that most of the high-force behavior previously attributed to stretch elasticity is really a feature of the corrected entropic elasticity; the true stretch compliance of single-stranded DNA is several times smaller than that found by previous authors. Next we elaborate our model to allow coexistence of two conformational states of DNA, each with its own stretch and bend elastic constants. Our model is computationally simple, and gives an excellent fit through the entire overstretching transition of nicked, double-stranded DNA. The fit gives the first values for the elastic constants of the stretched state.

Based on the classified atlas databases, the creative design of several kinds of mechanisms is also conducted to verify {{the usefulness of the}} method. The overall structure of the thesis is as follows. (1) In chapter 2, the representation models of planar kinematic <b>chains</b> with simple <b>joints,</b> multiple joints and geared joints are presented and the relationships between these models are revealed. (2) In chapter 3, the relationships of contracted graphs of planar non-fractionated kinematic chains and their link assortment arrays are revealed first. Then a fully-automatic method for the synthesis of the contracted graphs of planar non-fractionated kinematic chains is proposed. With the method, the complete families of non-fractionated contracted graphs and of valid contracted graphs with up to eight basic loops and all possible degrees of freedom are synthesized and obtained for the first time. (3) In chapter 4, a general method is proposed to synthesize planar non-fractionated kinematic chains and mechanisms based on the obtained contracted graphs. The method is fully-automatic and designer-friendly, and planar non-fractionated kinematic chains and mechanisms with up to 19 links are synthesized. Moreover, the classified atlas databases for these kinematic chains and mechanisms are also established. (4) In chapter 5, based on the structure characteristics of fractionated kinematic chains, a general synthesis equation of planar fractionated kinematic chains is proposed first. Then an automatic method is proposed to synthesize planar fractionated kinematic chains by the combination of planar non-fractionated kinematic chains, and the whole family of planar fractionated kinematic chains with up to seven basic loops is synthesized for the first time. (5) In chapter 6, based on the new bicolor topological graph and its inter-convertible characteristics with that of simple <b>joint</b> kinematic <b>chains,</b> an automatic method is proposed to synthesize multiple <b>joint</b> kinematic <b>chains</b> from simple <b>joint</b> kinematic <b>chains</b> and their classified atlas databases.

These methods include the Jacobian Tranpose, Jacobian Pseudoinverse, and Damped Least Squares.

A weight-based approach is used to handle priority of the constraints, those being the end effector's position, its rotation, and contact constraints.
