5000|$|Article 17 {{provides}} that [...] "the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>set-off</b> is not agreed by the parties, set-off shall {{be governed by}} the law applicable to the claim against which the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>set-off</b> is asserted." [...] This is potentially problematic, as by definition set-off deals with two separate claims. It seems that set-off is to be viewed defensively with respect to each claim, which creates the possibility of asymetric application (ie. set-off might operate to partly extinguish a German law claim, but not partly extinguish the Spanish claim which is relied upon to do so). The better view would presumably be that the set-off must be operative under each governing law to be effective under either.|$|E
5000|$|When {{a company}} goes into {{insolvent}} liquidation, any mutual debts between {{the company and}} a creditor intending to prove in the liquidation will be set-off. [...] The right of set-off is mandatory, and cannot be waived. Nor is the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>set-off</b> lost {{by virtue of the}} fact that the creditor had notice of the company’s insolvency at the time of extending credit to it.|$|E
2500|$|Where {{a company}} is deemed to be unable to pay its debts, this {{has a number of}} other affects in {{addition}} to the ability for a creditor to present a petition to wind it up. [...] It also means that the directors are expected to discharge their duties {{in the best interest of}} the company's creditors rather than its shareholders; that transactions may be potentially vulnerable as voidable transactions, and that the <b>right</b> of creditors <b>to</b> <b>set-off</b> mutual debts may become impaired in relation to debts which are incurred during the period of insolvency.|$|R

2500|$|Curiously the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance {{makes no}} express {{provision}} for insolvency set-off within the statute itself, and instead the relevant provisions are incorporated by reference from the Bankruptcy Ordinance. [...] Any sums which are owed by a creditor {{to the company}} are set-off against sums which are owed by the company to that creditor. [...] In order for insolvency <b>set-off</b> <b>to</b> operate there must be strict mutuality between the claims (in that the company and creditor must both be beneficially entitled to the relevant debts, not merely claimants as agents or trustees for another party). [...] The rules of insolvency set-off are mandatory, {{and it is not}} possible to contract out of them. [...] The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> insolvency <b>set-off</b> is not if the creditor was aware that a winding-up petition had been presented at the time credit was extended to the company.|$|R
50|$|Although {{slightly}} anachronistic, {{the rationale}} {{appears to be}} that the customer of the bank should not be at risk of the bank combining a short-term current account on which the customer writes cheques for daily expenses with a long-term loan account which is not due for repayment until some future time. In practice, most loan agreements will usually give the bank a contractual <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>set-off</b> in any event.|$|E
50|$|The High Court {{held that}} since the {{security}} agreements did not impose personal liability on the third parties for the loans, the companies had no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>set-off</b> under rule 4.90. In the Court of Appeal Millet LJ gave the leading judgment and said ‘a man cannot have a proprietary interest in a debt or other obligation which he owes another.’ The charges were conceptually impossible. Yet they were nevertheless good security by reason of the contractual provision limiting the right to repayment {{and that there were}} no grounds for holding that they were ineffective unless construed as imposing personal liability.|$|E
40|$|Non-payment has seriously {{plagued the}} {{construction}} industry and it severely distressed contractor's cash flow. Despite the fact that industry can only function {{on the basis of}} payment by the employers, over the years the employers had relied on the contention to set-off {{and use it as a}} basis for their refusal to pay the contractors as the amount due as shown in the payment certificates. In Malaysia, CIDB 2000, PAM 2006 and PWD Form 203 (A) Standard Form of Contract are widely used to govern construction projects and manage contractual relationship between contractors and the employers. By reviewing law cases, this paper has been done to explore the magnitude of the employers in using their right in set-off as the basis for non-payment in relation to Common Law, CIDB 2000, PAM 2006 and PWD Form 203 (A). The discussion and argument shows that contractors' right in payment can be deprived and challenged due to employer's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>set-off</b> in Common law, CIDB 2000, and notably expressed in PWD Form 203 (A) Standard Form of Contract. However, the employers' contention to set-off in PAM 2006 is governed under the "expressio unius est exclusio alterius" principle, whereby the set-off principle has been extinguished and only limited to what is dictated and laid out in the PAM 2006 Contract. This paper attempts to shed a light for the contractors, substantiating a platform for the contractors to understand to what extend their payment can be withheld when employers deprive their right for payment based on the allegation of set-off...|$|E

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the issue of {{admissibility}} of conditional declarations of intent made in order to exercise the rights to alter unilaterally the legal relationships. In regard to such declarations of intent it is commonly assumed that their nature bears no uncertainty and therefore it is not allowed to make these declarations on a condition (see Article 89 of the Civil Code). The party which executes such right is empowered to modify the legal relation unilaterally, without participation of the recipient of such declaration of intent; therefore the uncertainty caused by the condition is deemed to violate the interests of the recipient of this declaration. The author argues {{that it is not the}} uncertainty of legal relations of the recipient, but the unilateral interference in the recipient’s legal positon that may render the conditionality of such declaration of intent inadmissible. The author analyzes the most frequently used rights to alter unilaterally the legal relationships, such as i. a. : <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>set-off</b> the mutual claims, rescission right, right to terminate the obligation, right to evade the legal consequences of a defective declaration of intent, right of repurchase, right of pre-emption, as well as right to revoke the donation in case of a glaring ingratitude of the recipient, and attempts to indicate the cases, in which the conditional execution of these rights should be allowed, as it would cause no unbearable harm to the legal interest of the recipient. This is very often the case, if the occurrence or non-occurrence of a future uncertain event depends on the recipient himself. Furthermore, certain rights to modify the legal relation are time-limited, for they may be executed only within a specific period of time. In these cases the conditional execution of a right does not increase the uncertainty of the legal position of the recipient, if the fulfillment or non-fulfillment of the condition also occurs within this period of time. Moreover, in regard to each of the discussed rights to alter the legal relationship the paper analyzes the scope of admissibility of resolutive conditions as well as the stipulations of the retroactive effect of the fulfillment of the condition. At the end the author presents an analysis of the issue of admissibility of conditional declarations of intent altering unilaterally the legal relation in cases, in which these declarations are made by a participant to a civil proceedings in order to defend ones rights in these proceedings, and discusses the legal significance of the so-called precautionary declarations of intent that are very commonly used during the civil proceedings...|$|E

The production of Dido and Aeneas was a considerable success and highly influential in reviving interest in the music of Purcell, then so little known that three copies of The Times review were delivered to the theatre: one addressed to Mr Shaw, one to Mr Craig, and one to Mr Purcell.

40|$|Close-out netting {{is a risk}} {{mitigation}} tool used by financial institutions. It is comparable <b>to</b> <b>set-off</b> and its effects in insolvency are loosely comparable to a super-priority. Therefore, it might conflict with the pari passu principle. Many jurisdictions have solved that conflict and adapted their laws so that close-out netting is enforceable even {{in the event of}} insolvency. However, as the financial market is global, the parties, their branches and assets might be located in different jurisdictions. Nevertheless, countries failed to agree on a harmonised conflict-of-laws rule, despite the obvious need, when they decided not to include a conflict-of-laws principle in the 2013 Unidroit Principles on the operation of close-out netting provisions. The relevant EU law, though patchy, already addresses this concern. This article identifies the underlying conceptual difficulties and proposes a solution for an improved framework for both the EU and other financial marketplaces...|$|R
50|$|On 20 May 1968 {{the company}} gave the bank notice {{of a meeting}} of {{creditors}} to be held on 12 June under sections 294 and 295 of the Companies Act 1948. The bank did not rely on that notice as constituting a material change of circumstances within the terms of their agreement. On 12 June the company paid into the No. 2 account a cheque for £8,611. Later that day, a resolution was passed at the creditors' meeting for the voluntary winding up of the company. The cheque was credited to the No. 2 account on 13 June and cleared on 14 June. In the liquidation, the bank claimed {{to be entitled to}} set off the £8,611 against the company's indebtedness on the No. 1 account.
