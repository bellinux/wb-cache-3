40|$|AbstractHodgkin and <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> {{are derived}} from {{germinal}} center B cells. Amplification of identical rearranged and mutated immunoglobulin genes from different Hodgkin and <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> from the same patient also answered {{the question of the}} malignant nature because the clonality—the key criterion of malignancy—of Hodgkin and <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> was hereby shown.

Recent publications demonstrate that a probably small subset of Hodgkin disease exists with T-cell derivation of the respective Hodgkin and <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells.</b> The management of Hodgkin’s disease is undergoing a paradigm shift as a result of very effective drug regimens that are capable of inducing high remission rates, the use of combined chemoradiotherapy with involved-field irradiation in early stages, the introduction of effective salvage chemotherapy of relapsed Hodgkin’s disease with peripheral stem cell transplantation, a better understanding of prognostic factors, economic constraints, and a more sensitive realization of the magnitude of late treatment mortality...|$|R
40|$|The {{cellular}} {{origin of}} the <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> of Hodgkin's disease is controversial. The authors studied 14 cases of Hodgkin's disease (nodular sclerosis, 9; mixed cellularity, 3; lymphocyte predominant, 2), utilizing a panel of 16 monoclonal antibodies, including 5 new monoclonal antibodies defining differentiation antigens of the monocyte/macrophage system. <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> were found to react with antibodies to Ia-like (HLA-DR) determinants (14 of 14 cases), Leu M 1, an antigranulocyte antibody (11 of 14 cases), and rarely B- 1, an antibody defining an antigen expressed on human B lymphocytes (2 of 14 cases). <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> did not react with any of 5 antibodies to differentiation antigens of the monocyte/macrophage system (MoP 9, MoS 39, MoR 17, MoU 26, MoU 50).

40|$|AIMS: To {{evaluate}} {{the expression of}} c-myc and bcl- 2 oncogene products in <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> in Hodgkin's disease, especially in relation to Epstein-Barr virus infection and expression of EBV encoded latent membrane protein (LMP). METHODS: Tissues from 33 cases of Hodgkin's disease were studied {{for the presence of}} EBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA in situ hybridisation (DISH), for the presence of EBER- 1 and EBER- 2 EBV RNA by RNA in situ hybridisation (RISH); and for the presence of LMP, bcl- 2, and c-myc proteins by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: A substantial number of <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> expressed bcl- 2 in 20 of 29 (69 %) and c-myc in 30 of 32 (94 %) Hodgkin's disease samples. In 18 of the 25 (72 %) cases <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> expressed both oncogene products. Of these 18 cases, 10 (56 %) were EBV-PCR positive; eight (44 %) were EBV-PCR negative. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> in Hodgkin's disease frequently express both bcl- 2 and c-myc oncogene products, suggesting that these oncogenes may act in concert in the pathogenesis of the disease. Moreover, the expression of c-myc and bcl- 2 proteins in <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> is independent of EBV and LMP status...|$|R

To test this possibility we studied the expression of HLA class I and II determinants on <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> in tissue sections and cell suspensions of Hodgkin's disease. Frozen tissue sections of 40 cases and cytocentrifuge preparations from cell suspensions of 10 lymph nodes involved by Hodgkin's disease were studied with monoclonal antibodies reactive with HLA determinants.

Careful examination of the tissue sections and subsequently of cytospins of cell suspensions showed that the <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> frequently lacked HLA class I but showed strong staining for HLA class II.

40|$|The B 7 /BB 1 {{molecule}} {{has recently}} {{been found to be}} expressed on professional antigen-presenting cells and to be the natural ligand for CD 28 and CTLA- 4 on T cells.

In view of the data supporting an antigen-presenting function of <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells,</b> we evaluated the expression of B 7 /BB 1 in lymph nodes affected by Hodgkin's disease. B 7 /BB 1 was found to be strongly expressed by the <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> in all 47 cases of Hodgkin's disease studied. Moreover, <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> were frequently surrounded by CD 28 -expressing T cells. Evidence for a functional role of B 7 /BB 1 on <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> was obtained by our findings that T-cell proliferation and interleukin- 2 (IL- 2) production in the primary allogenic mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), using the B 7 /BB 1 -expressing Hodgkin's disease-derived cell lines L 428 and KM-H 2 as stimulators, could be partially blocked by adding anti-B 7 monoclonal antibody. B 7 /BB 1 expression was also evaluated in a group of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (n = 46). Whereas B 7 /BB 1 was not expressed by the neoplastic cells of most non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, including T-cell-rich B-cell lymphoma (n = 11), it was present on the neoplastic cells of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (Ki- 1 lymphoma) (n = 5) and follicular lymphoma (n = 4).

In other types of Hodgkin's disease, L 26 positive cells occurred in small or large aggregates and generally represented a minor proportion of the population of lymphoid cells.

50|$|When only 28 years old, Mendenhall {{discovered}} the cell for Hodgkin’s {{disease and the}} evolution of the cells. Previously Hodgkin’s disease was considered a form of tuberculosis but her contribution (1901) established that it was a form of cancer, not infection. She tested the concept on rabbits by showing that Hodgkin’s disease was not transmissible unlike tuberculosis. Dorothy used microscopic specimens to compare tissue samples from TB and Hodgkin’s patients. It was then that she observed the large giant cells (The Dorothy Reed Cell later termed the <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>Cell).</b> Since the giant cells were distinct in the characteristics it possessed, Hodgkin’s disease had a clear diagnostic marker. Having a way to clearly identify the condition allowed the development of effective treatment. Five-year survival of Hodgkin’s is about 80% vs about 40% for Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The Lewis x trisaccharide, also {{referred}} to as the CD 15 antigen, is a diagnostic marker used to distinguish Hodgkin's lymphoma from other lymphocytic cancers. However, the role of such fucosylated structures remains poorly understood, in part because carriers of Lewis x structures on Hodgkin's Reed-Sternberg cells have not been identified. Methods GalMBP, an engineered carbohydrate-recognition protein that binds selectively to oligosaccharides with paired terminal galactose and fucose residues, has been used in conjunction with proteomic and glycomic analysis to identify glycoprotein carriers of Lewis x and related glycan structures in multiple Hodgkin's <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cell</b> lines. Results Multiple glycoproteins that bind to GalMBP and carry CD 15 /Lewis x have been identified in a panel of six <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cell</b> lines. The most commonly identified Lewis x -bearing glycoproteins are CD 98 hc, which was found in all six cell lines tested, and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 and DEC- 205, which were detected in five and four of the lines, respectively. Thus, several of the most prominent cell adhesion molecules on the lymphomas carry this characteristic glycan epitope. In addition, the Hodgkin's <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cell</b> lines can be grouped into subsets based on {{the presence or absence of}} less common Lewis x -bearing glycoproteins. Conclusions CD 98 and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 are major carriers of CD 15 /Lewis x on Reed-Sternberg cells. Binding of DC-SIGN and other glycan-specific receptors to the Lewis x epitopes on CD 98 and intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 may facilitate interaction of the lymphoma cells with lymphocytes and myeloid cells in lymph nodes. </p...|$|E

In the four cases of lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin's disease the multinucleated <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells</b> did not stain with either antigranulocyte antibody but were strongly positive with anti-HLA-DR. Twenty five cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, in which there were multinucleated giant <b>cells</b> resembling <b>Reed-Sternberg</b> <b>cells,</b> were studied in a similar way.
