40|$|An in situ {{observation}} {{of the formation of}} a laser-irradiation-induced nanodot array on a Si surface performed using a pulsed-laser-equipped high-voltage electron microscope (laser-HVEM). Under multiple nanosecond (ns) pulsed laser irradiation shots, atomic clusters were firrst formed and distributed on the surface in order to grow them epitaxially into protruded dots with diameters of ten nanometers or less. This is followed by their diffusion induced by successive laser shots to cannibalize and merge them into a <b>ripple</b> <b>line</b> with aligned, larger dots. We conclude that the present subwavelength two-dimensionally-ordered nanodot array is formed by self-organization under pulsed laser irradiation...|$|E

In the proposed approach, by varying a constant (k 2) value from zero to one, various DPWM algorithms can be generated along with the SVPWM algorithm. As the proposed approach uses instantaneous phase voltages only for the calculation of gating times of the inverter, the complexity burden involved is very less {{when compared with the}} classical space vector approach. Then, the rms stator flux ripple, which is a measure of <b>ripple</b> in <b>line</b> current characteristics have been plotted for all the DPWM and SVPWM algorithms. From which, it is concluded that the SVPWM algorithm gives superior performance at low modulation indices, whereas the DPWM algorithm gives superior performance at higher modulation indices. Hence, to achieve the superior waveform quality at all modulation indices, a hybrid PWM (HPWM) algorithm has been presented in this paper. To validate the proposed algorithms, several numerical simulation studies have been carried out and results have been presented and compared...|$|R

This paper {{presents}} the electronic ballast, {{in which the}} coupling induc-tors are used to inject the current to the dc-bus capacitors, to boost the dc-bus volt-age and to filter out the <b>ripples</b> from input <b>line</b> current. The current injection cou-pling inductor injects its stored energy to the dc-bus capacitors in every switching half cycle. Whereas, the boost coupling inductor keeps the dc-bus voltage always above the peak of ac input voltage. Therefore, the proposed ballast maintains unity-power-factor and high efficiency with ripple-free input current over wide range of input line voltage in case of worst regulation. A symmetrical half-bridge inverter is used to drive the fluorescent lamps.

Theproposed ADPWM based IM drive uses a special category of sequences which not only reduces the switching losses but also reduces the line current distortion during high speed operations. However analysis in this paper is limited to harmonic <b>ripple</b> in <b>line</b> current and comparison of the proposed method is done with the conventional DTC (CDTC), conventional space vector pulse width modulation (CSVPWM) based DTC and clamping sequences based DTC. The proposed method uses a special category of DPWM sequences, 0121 and 7212. This category of DPWM sequences are referred as double switching clamping sequences as they not only clamp one of the phase to either of the buses but alsoswitches one of the remaining two phases twice in every sub cycle. In this paper it is shown that, utilizing DPWM sequences and by changing the zero state at any spatial angle    where  is between 00 and 600 {{an infinite number of}} ADPWM methods can be generated which are categorized as “continual clamping” and “split clamping” sequences.

40|$|Microinverter {{has become}} a new trend for {{photovoltaic}} (PV) grid-tie systems due to its advantages which include greater energy harvest, simplified system installation, enhanced safety, and flexible expansion. Since an individual microinverter system is typically attached {{to the back of}} a PV module, it is desirable that it has a long lifespan that can match PV modules, which routinely warrant 25 years of operation. In order to increase the life expectancy and improve the long-term reliability, electrolytic capacitors must be avoided in microinverters because they have been identified as an unreliable component. One solution to avoid electrolytic capacitors in microinverters is using a two-stage architecture, where the high voltage direct current (DC) bus can work as a double <b>line</b> <b>ripple</b> buffer.

40|$|Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray {{scattering}} (GISAXS) {{has been}} used to structurally characterize model hard and soft gratings of nanotechnological interest. The different gratings exhibit GISAXS patterns with characteristic features that can be associated with their level of order along the direction of periodicity and the length of the lines. Highly ordered gratings, made out of silicon by electron beam lithography, and those nanofabricated on spin-coated polymer films by nanoimprint lithography, exhibit characteristic semicircle-like GISAXS patterns with intensity spots periodically distributed on a semicircle whose radius is related to the incidence angle used. These gratings can be considered as one-dimensional crystalline lattices as provided by computer simulations. Less ordered polymer gratings prepared by the laser-induced periodic surface structuring method exhibit a GISAXS pattern characterized by periodic rod-like scattering maxima whose intensity decreases with increasing horizontal scattering angle. In this case the gratings can be considered as one-dimensional paracrystals.

40|$|ABSTRACT: X-ray radiographs of box cores {{of shelf}} sand {{off the coast}} of California and Oregon show linear {{concentrations}} of grains opaque to X-rays. A number of the lines cross one another, suggesting that they are of biogenic origin. Experimental studies how that infaunal polychaetes such as Nephtys produce similar concentrations of heavy minerals as they move through sand. A similar origin is postulated for the observed concentrations in the shelf-sand box cores. Howard and Reineck, in their analysis of the depositional facies off the Southern Cal-ifornia coast, found one sedimentary struc-ture particularly difficult to explain (1981, p. 818). Well expressed in X-ray radiographs of sandy cores taken in water depths between 15 and 33 m, the structure appears as linear concentrations of grains, presumably heavy minerals, that are opaque to X-rays. Howard and Reineck state that the most plausible x-planation of the structure, based on an ex-periment hat I conducted, is that it repre-sents the traces of a burrowing polychaete that concentrates heavy minerals along the bottom of its burrow. This note describes the experiment. The structure in question appears on pos-itive radiograph prints as primarily subhor-izontal, slightly sinuous lines a fraction of a millimeter thick and up to 8 cm long. The structure somewhat resembles <b>ripple</b> lami-nation; the <b>lines</b> intersect in places, however, and therefore cannot be bedding structures. Details of the structure suggest hat it is biogenic. Some lines occur in pairs, forming roughly parallel lines about a millimeter apart that locally converge to a single line. Above the lines are subtle, lighter-toned halos about 3 mm thick that indicate greater penetration of the X-rays. The radiographs also show dark, concave-up, aired arcuate lines about 3 mm long and about 2 mrn apart. Above the pair of arcs is an elliptical lighter-colored hal...|$|R
