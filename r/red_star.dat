The two major stadiums in Belgrade are the Marakana (<b>Red</b> <b>Star</b> Stadium) and the Partizan Stadium.

In May 1911, Kroonlands crew, acting on rumors of an impending British mariner's strike, refused to sign on for the ship's next voyage, forcing <b>Red</b> <b>Star</b> to hire a replacement crew.|$|E

5|$|For {{the second}} time in three years, Žigić was chosen as {{domestic}} player {{of the year in the}} captains' poll, and was also honoured by the <b>Red</b> <b>Star</b> Sport Association as best male athlete of 2005, an award open to athletes representing the club in any sport, not just in football. After Pantelić's departure for Hertha BSC, Red Star's goals were spread more evenly among the remaining forward players. In the league, Žigić and Boško Janković were joint-top scorers with 12, and Purović contributed one fewer, as the club won their 24th title. They completed the double with a defeat of city rivals OFK in the cup final, coming back from 2–0 down via Žigić's 67th-minute free kick under the defensive wall and Purović's equaliser to take the match into extra time, during which Žigić gave <b>Red</b> <b>Star</b> the lead with a header and Dušan Basta made the final score 4–2. After the match, Žigić refused to answer questions about his <b>Red</b> <b>Star</b> future.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the Kosovar Albanian {{population}} {{was able to}} use the Albanian flag as its national flag. However, the flag had to be charged with a <b>red</b> <b>star,</b> since this was a common symbol of the Yugoslav nation. Even without this requirement, the flag of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania at the time had a <b>red</b> <b>star,</b> outlined in gold, above the double headed eagle. Later on, different nationalities in Kosovo could use their own national flags in accordance with legislation.|$|E

5|$|Resuming the {{partnership}} with Marko Pantelić {{begun in the}} second half of 2003–04, Žigić continued to score freely in the new season. With <b>Red</b> <b>Star</b> two goals and a man down in the first leg of the Champions League qualifier against Young Boys, he netted twice in the last 12 minutes to give his team an away draw. Domestically, Pantelić top-scored with 21 league goals and Žigić contributed 15 as <b>Red</b> <b>Star</b> finished in second place, behind Partizan. Žigić scored against Partizan to help <b>Red</b> <b>Star</b> reach the cup final, but was one of five regular starters unavailable for that match through injury or suspension, and his team lost to a last-minute goal to ten-man Železnik.|$|E

5|$|Žigić {{was born}} in Bačka Topola, {{in what was then}} SFR Yugoslavia. He began playing {{football}} as a youngster with AIK Bačka Topola, and scored 68 goals from 76 first-team matches over a three-year period in the third tier of Yugoslav football.

A brief spell back in the third tier with Kolubara preceded his turning professional with First League side <b>Red</b> <b>Star</b> Belgrade in 2002. He spent time on loan at third-tier Spartak Subotica before making his <b>Red</b> <b>Star</b> debut in 2003. Despite suggestions that his height, of , made him better suited to sports other than football, Žigić ended the season as First League top scorer, domestic player of the year, league champion and scorer of the winning goal in the cup final. He won a second league–cup double in 2005–06, a second player of the year award, and finished his three-year <b>Red</b> <b>Star</b> career with 70 goals from 109 appearances in all competitions.|$|E
5|$|Diaby {{was born}} in the 10th {{arrondissement}} of Paris, but was raised in the Parisian commune of Aubervilliers. He began his football career playing for hometown club CM Aubervilliers. In 1998, he joined <b>Red</b> <b>Star</b> Paris. A year later, Diaby was selected to attend the Clairefontaine academy. He spent four years at the academy while simultaneously training with <b>Red</b> <b>Star.</b> A year before departing Clairefontaine, Diaby moved to professional club Paris Saint-Germain. Following an administrative error by club officials which made Diaby a free agent, he joined the academy of Auxerre. He spent two years in the club's youth academy before making his professional debut in the 2004–05 season. Diaby also played in the UEFA Cup with the club. After spending the Autumn portion of the 2005–06 season with Auxerre, in January 2006, Diaby signed with English club Arsenal on a long-term contract for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut with the club that same month and scored his first goal three months later against Aston Villa.|$|E

5|$|The flag {{does not}} differ {{significantly}} from {{the flag of the}} Byelorussian SSR, other than the removal of the hammer and sickle and the <b>red</b> <b>star,</b> and the reversal of red and white in the hoist pattern. While there is no official interpretation for the colors of the flag, an explanation given by President Alexander Lukashenko is that red represents freedom and the sacrifice of the nation's forefathers, while green represents life.|$|E
5|$|The {{flag of the}} Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic {{was adopted}} by decree on December 25, 1951. The flag was {{slightly}} modified in 1956 when construction details were added for the <b>red</b> <b>star,</b> and golden hammer and sickle. The final specifications of the flag was set in Article 120 of the Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR and {{are very similar to}} the current Belarusian flag. The flag had a length-to-width ratio of one to two (1:2), just like the flag of the Soviet Union (and the other fourteen union republics). The main portion of the flag was red (representing the Revolution), with the rest being green (representing the Belarusian forests). A pattern of white drawn on red decorated the hoist portion of the flag; this design is often used on Belarusian traditional costumes. In the upper corner of the flag, in the red portion, a gold hammer and sickle was added, with a <b>red</b> <b>star</b> outlined in gold above it. The hammer represented the worker, and the sickle the peasant; according to Soviet ideology, these two symbols crossed together symbolized co-operation between the two classes. The <b>red</b> <b>star,</b> a symbol commonly used by Communist parties, was said to stand either for the five social groups (workers, youth, peasants, military, and academics), the five known continents, or the five fingers of the worker's hand. The hammer, sickle and star were sometimes not displayed on the reverse of the flag. The purpose for this design was that the Byelorussian SSR, along with the Soviet Union and the Ukrainian SSR, were admitted to the United Nations in 1945 as founding members and needed distinct flags for each other. The designer of the flag was Milkahil Gusyev.|$|E
