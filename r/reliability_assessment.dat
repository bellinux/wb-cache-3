40|$|The {{stringent}} {{performance and}} reliability demands that will accompany {{the development of}} next-generation circuits and new metallization technologies will require new and more accurate means of assessing interconnect <b>reliability.</b> <b>Reliability</b> <b>assessments</b> based on conventional methodologies are flawed {{in a number of}} very important ways, including the disregard of the effects of complex interconnect geometries on reliability. New models, simulations and experimental methodologies are required for the development of tools for circuit-level and process-sensitive <b>reliability</b> <b>assessments.</b> Most modeling and experimental characterization of interconnect reliability has focused on simple straight lines terminating at pads or vias. However, laid-out integrated circuits usually have many interconnects with junctions and wide-to-narrow transitions. In carrying out circuit-level <b>reliability</b> <b>assessments</b> {{it is important to be}} able to assess the reliability of these more complex shapes, generally referred to as "trees". An interconnect tree consists of continuously connected high-conductivity metal within one layer of metallization. Trees terminate at diffusion barriers at vias and contacts, and, i...|$|R
