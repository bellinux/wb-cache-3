It was located by a longitudinal <b>reaction</b> <b>strut</b> on each side, linked to the axle at the front and to the aft leaf spring attachment point at the rear.|$|E
40|$|An {{actuator}} <b>reaction</b> <b>strut</b> {{from the}} VC IO aileron power control circuit, made from steel, has been redoslgned, made and tested in carbon {{fibre reinforced plastic}} (CFRP) with aluminium alloy ends, partly to demonstrate the weight saving potential of CFRP {{in this type of}} application and partly to investigate some of the problems of jointing and load diffusion which CFRP presents. The strut has overall axial strength and stiffness requirements in both tension and compression. All have been met with the redeslgned CFRP strut with the exception of tensile stiffness, the low value of which was shown to be fundamental to the form of end attachment adopted. This Report describes the design, fabrication and testing of the CFR...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the wing weight estimation of strut-braced wing aircraft in conceptual design. The method is simple to implement and captures important effects {{for the design of}} high aspect ratio braced wings. Conventional aluminum design or composites can be considered. Aeroelastic divergence, aileron reversal and elastic effects on the wing lift distribution are accounted for with simple strip theory and beam stiffness matrices. The stiffness matrices are extended to include the <b>strut</b> <b>reaction.</b> A direct method is used for the strut and wing internal loads calculation. Comparison with Nastran results shows good accuracy in the prediction of aeroelastic effects and <b>strut</b> <b>reaction.</b> Design studies show potential to reduce the wing mass between 11...|$|R
40|$|Tensile {{deformation}} {{and failure}} behavior {{at room temperature}} of the open cell nickel and copper foams with high porosity (96 %) fabricated with the slurry foaming process at Mitsubishi Materials Corporation, Japan, was studied. In-situ observation of the deformation and failure behavior was conducted with a digital microscope. Stress-strain curves were measured, in which a non-contact extensometer was employed to detect the strain of the samples accurately. Electric resistance was measured to monitor the damage evolution. Finite element stress analysis was conducted to calculate the morphological change of cells with applied strain and the stress distribution in cells. It was revealed that the deformation and failure progressed through the following four stages; stage I characterized by the elastic deformation, stage II by plastic deformation, stage III by the co-occurrence of plastic deformation and cumulative failure of struts and stage IV by the chain <b>reaction</b> of <b>strut</b> failure nearly in a limited cross-section, respectively. Also {{it was found that}} the distribution of failure strain of struts in stage III, measured from the serrations in the stress-strain curve, could be described by the Weibull distribution, with which the transition from stage II to III was identified. Also, the result of the statistical analysis suggested that the average failure strain of the struts in the foam is much higher than the strain at ultimate stress of the foam...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} the wing weight estimation of strut-braced wing aircraft in conceptual design. The method is simple to implement while still capturing important effects for early design estimates. Static aeroelastic loads, aeroelastic divergence and aileron reversal criteria are calculated directly with small matrices suitable for implementation in spreadsheet software. Maneuver, gust and ground cases are considered. A direct non-iterative method {{is used for the}} strut and wing internal loads calculation. The wing and strut load-carrying structures are sized with analytical box-beam equations for strength, buckling and fatigue criteria. Aluminum or composite laminates can be considered. Semi-empirical methods are presented for non-optimal mass components and the secondary structure. The aeroelastic effects and <b>strut</b> <b>reaction</b> estimations are compared {{for a wide range of}} design parameters with Nastran validating the proposed method. The weight estimations are verified with conventional aircraft data and strut-braced wing studies available in the literature, showing good accuracy. Design trade studies are presented illustrating typical applications of the method. A potential to reduce the wing mass in about 18 % or to increase the aspect ratio from 10 to 16 compared to a cantilever wing is identified...|$|R
40|$|Damping is an {{important}} consideration in state-of-the-art space missions, as it {{is often used to}} mitigate launch loads and low-amplitude spacecraft disturbances. Although damping treatments are very effective, their implementation may be limited due to mass, cost and schedule constraints, or due to added complexity to the system design and verification efforts. Damped joints are a simple and cost effective damping option which can be easily incorporated into a spacecraft design. This approach can be used at bus panels, equipment interfaces, isolator ball joints and flexures, and other structural joints. In addition to increased damping, the addition of viscoelastic material to structural joints results in improved joint performance due to removal of nonlinear effects of friction and gaps. A viscoelastic damped ball joint was developed and demonstrated on three applications: 1) tuned-mass damping, resulting in 30 - 50 % critical damping to fixed-base damper modes; 2) acoustic test panel supports, resulting in up to a factor of 4 reduction of acoustic loads; and 3) <b>reaction</b> wheel isolator <b>struts,</b> resulting in 5 - 10 % critical damping of isolator modes (and higher at strut modes). An overview of the damped joint design, analysis and testing will be presented in this paper. Nomenclature f = frequency T = temperature G*(f,T) = complex shear modulus as a function of frequency and temperature G (f,T) = shear storage modulus as a function of frequency and temperature (f,T) = loss factor as a function of frequency and temperature I...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} thesis is static {{analysis}} {{and design of}} a timber bridge, with a structure that is designed for road transport. In the thesis we set out the main actions on the bridge and we made static and modal analysis with the computer program Sofistik. We also designed load-bearing elements and their connections. The design {{has been done in}} accordance with the European standard Eurocode, where the National Annex has been taken into consideration. The bridge which we have designed does not exist and we have conceived the load-bearing structure on the basis of already existing similar timber bridges. Location of the bridge was selected on the main road in the village Luče, where it crosses the river Savinja. Span of the bridge is 32 m and its width is 7 m. The primary load-bearing structure of the bridge consists of two struts {{on both sides of the}} bridge which supports steel HEB beam through vertical hangers. On top of the steel beam, which is in the middle of the span, takes place eight longitudinal timber beams, bearing timber deck. Timber deck is made of a wooden, upright facing planks that are positioned perpendicular to the longitudinal beams and are connected with dowels. Both struts are linked with steel cables and therefore there are only vertical <b>reactions</b> in supports. <b>Struts</b> and longitudinal beams are rectangular and made of glued laminated timber GL- 36 H, the planks are of timber D 60...|$|R
