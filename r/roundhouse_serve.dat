40|$|Advocacy {{is central}} to the work of preservationists, yet the {{particular}} set of issues that must be addressed when advocating for the preservation of Modern municipal buildings is a topic that has not been previously explored. In addition to the challenges commonly confronted when advocating for the preservation of postwar resources, monumental Modern municipal buildings face substantive obstacles that emanate exclusively from their municipal ownership. Challenges encountered firsthand in advocating for the preservation of the Philadelphia Police Administration Building (the <b>Roundhouse)</b> <b>serve</b> as the primary motivation for this study which investigates the determining factors that lead to the successful preservation of Modern municipally owned buildings. Through case studies on the advocacy efforts for Boston City Hall, the Los Angeles Police Facilities Building (Parker Center), and the Philadelphia Police Administration Building, this thesis presents a series of best practices for both grassroots and organizational preservation advocates. The established recommendations are the result of empirical evidence obtained through interviews with individuals presently advocating for the preservation of Modern municipal buildings, those involved with local and national preservation organizations, municipal staff, and scholars in the field of Modern architectural preservation. While theoretical in nature, the presented strategies serve as sound maneuvers for shapin...|$|E

50|$|The Wassama Roundhouse is a {{reconstruction}} built in 1985 upon {{the location of}} four previous such houses. Originally dating prior to the 1860s, the <b>roundhouses</b> <b>served</b> as {{the focal point of}} spiritual and ceremonial life for many Native Californians. In 1903, the third roundhouse was built using portions of the center pole from the two earlier houses. It is California Historical Landmark #1001.|$|R

500|$|The {{museum was}} founded in 1977, when the Southern Railway deeded [...] of land to North Carolina for a {{transportation}} museum. Two years later, another [...] {{was added to the}} original donation; the entirety of the railway's largest former steam locomotive repair shops. The museum's first exhibit called People, Places and Time opened in 1983. The museum grew over the years, most notably in 1996, with the opening of Barber Junction, a relocated railroad depot from some 30 miles away, and the newly renovated Bob Julian <b>Roundhouse.</b> Barber Junction <b>serves</b> as the museum's Visitor's Center and departure point for the on-site train ride. The Bob Julian <b>Roundhouse</b> <b>serves</b> as the hub for most of the museum's railroad exhibits, but also includes aviation exhibits and site history.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, the new Edaville Railroad {{opened for}} operation. Owned and {{operated}} by construction company owner Jack Flagg, developer John Delli Priscoli and cranberry grower Douglas Beaton, the railroad acquired a 'new' steam locomotive, #21 [...] "Anne Elizabeth", built by the English firm of Hudswell Clarke and {{a veteran of the}} Fiji sugar industry. Several of the original Edaville buildings, including the station and the engine house, were demolished with new buildings taking their place. Plans called {{for the construction of a}} <b>roundhouse,</b> <b>served</b> by the original turntable, with an enlarged collection of locomotives and rolling stock.|$|R
5000|$|The GB&S {{started in}} Port McNicoll {{on the western}} side of Hogg's Bay outside Midland. CP built up {{extensive}} operations in the port area, including a [...] wharf, lines running along both the shore and wharf, a 2,000,000 bushel grain elevator, and [...] flour shed. A large rail operating area was built to the south of the wharf, including a six shed <b>roundhouse</b> <b>served</b> by a [...] turntable. The table was later replaced by a [...] model in April 1930. The elevator was upgraded several times, 4,000,000 bushels in 1911 and eventually reaching 6,500,000 bushels during 1922/23, still well short of the original plan for 12,000,000 bushels.|$|R
50|$|Kamela is {{the highest}} {{railroad}} pass in the Blue Mountains, with an elevation of 4206 ft. Kamela had a <b>roundhouse</b> and <b>served</b> as a wood and timber handling point for the railroad. In 1904, {{the population of the}} community was 220. In 1940 Kamela had a population of 27. At one time the community had a school. One of the last Oregon train robberies began in Kamela in 1914.|$|R
25|$|The Trestle is the {{substructure}} of a Post Mill, usually {{enclosed in}} a protective structure called a <b>roundhouse,</b> which also <b>serves</b> as a storage facility. Post mills without a roundhouse are called Open Trestle Post Mills.|$|R
50|$|In 1948 {{construction}} commenced on a 21 road <b>roundhouse</b> building <b>serving</b> No.2 turntable, all 21 undercover {{roads were}} fitted with 70 ft long service pits. This building is of similar construction to the East shed {{section of the}} roundhouse completed in 1947 at Junee Locomotive Depot and has brick side and end walls with intermediate concrete columns and wooden roof trusses clad with corrugated sheeting. At {{the same time the}} manually operated 75 ft turntable was replaced with a 100 ft diameter electrically operated turntable which was also similar to that provided at Junee. These works were for the proposed running of the D58 class locos from Broadmeadow. In 1948/49 a new office for the District Locomotive Engineer was constructed.|$|R
50|$|The Mount Savage rail yard had at {{its center}} a twelve stall <b>roundhouse,</b> which also <b>served</b> as a {{passenger}} depot. Close by was the fire clay brick refractory, and the Ramsey Glazed Brick Works. Several connecting switchtracks connected the different factories and furnaces to the Cumberland-bound mainline. Eventually the yard also connected to the Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad, which connected Mount Savage to Frostburg when the rail line was completed in the 1850s.|$|R
