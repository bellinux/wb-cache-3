50|$|The highly acidic {{environment}} in the stomach lumen causes proteins from food to lose their characteristic folded structure (or denature). This exposes the protein's peptide bonds. The gastric chief cells of the stomach secrete enzymes for protein breakdown (inactive pepsinogen, and in infancy <b>rennin).</b> Hydrochloric acid activates pepsinogen into the enzyme pepsin, which then helps digestion by breaking the bonds linking amino acids, {{a process known as}} proteolysis. In addition, many microorganisms have their growth inhibited by such an acidic environment, which is helpful to prevent infection.|$|E

50|$|Between the 1970s and 1980s, {{this view}} {{drastically}} changed. New experimental evidences showed that, under physiological conditions, non-lysosomal proteases {{were responsible for}} limited proteolysis of intra- and/or extracellular proteins, a concept originally conceived by Linderstᴓm-Lang in 1950. Endogenous or exogenous proteins are processed by non-lysosomal proteases into intermediate-sized polypeptides, which display gene and metabolic regulation, neurologic, endocrine, and immunological roles, whose dysfunction might explain a number of pathologies. Consequently, protein degradation did not represent anymore {{the end of the}} biological function of proteins, but rather the beginning of a yet unexplored side of the biology of the cells. A number of intra- or extracellular proteases release protein fragments endowed with essential biological activities. These hydrolytic processes could be carried out by proteases such as Proteasomes, Proprotein Convertases, Caspases, <b>Rennin</b> and Kallikreins. Among the products released by the non-lysosomal proteases are the bioactive oligopeptides such as hormones, neuropeptides and epitopes that, once released, could be modulated in their biological activities by specific peptidases, which promote the trimming, conversion and/or inactivation of the bioactive oligopeptides.|$|E
50|$|Similarly {{to other}} {{varieties}} of cheese, {{the process of}} making blue cheese consists of six standard steps, as well as further additions that give this blue-veined cheese its unique properties. The first step is acidification where a starter culture is added to milk in order to change lactose to lactic acid, thus changing the acidity of the milk and turning it from liquid to solid. The next step is coagulation, where rennet, a mixture of <b>rennin</b> and other material found in the stomach lining of a calf is added to solidify the milk further. Following this, thick curds are cut typically with a knife to encourage the release of liquid or whey. The smaller the curds are cut, the thicker and harder the resulting cheese will become. Salt is then added to provide flavor as well as to act as a preservative so the cheese does not spoil. Next, the cheese is given its form and further pressed with weights if necessary to expel any excess liquid. The final step is ripening the cheese by aging it. The temperature and the level of humidity in the room where the cheese is aging is monitored to ensure the cheese does not spoil or lose its optimal flavor and texture.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} {{about the origins of}} cheese. Cheesemaking may have originated from nomadic herdsmen who stored milk in vessels made from the sheep's and goats' stomachs. Because their stomach linings contains a mix of lactic acid, wild bacteria as milk contaminants and rennet, the milk would ferment and coagulate. Cheese, like other dairy products, “seems to bear the hallmark of pastoral nomads of Central Asia, who used animal stomach bags and untanned leather pouches as containers. Since the lining of the calf’s stomach contains the enzyme (<b>rennin)</b> that produces the curdling agent, rennet, milk kept in a calf’s stomach bag would turn to cheese more or less of its own accord.” [...] A product reminiscent of yogurt would have been produced, which, through gentle agitation and the separation of curds from whey would have resulted in the production of cheese; the cheese being essentially a concentration of the major milk protein, casein, and milk fat. The whey proteins, other minor milk proteins, and the lactose are all removed in the cheese whey. Another theory is offered by David Asher, who wrote that the origins actually lie within the “sloppy milk bucket in later European culture, it having gone unwashed and containing all of the necessary bacteria to facilitate the ecology of cheese.” ...|$|E
50|$|Since the {{discovery}} of the neuropeptides and peptide hormones from the central nervous system (ACTH, β-MSH, endorphin, oxytocin, vasopressin, LHRH, enkephalins, substance P), and of peripheral vasoactive peptides (angiotensin, bradykinin) around the middle of last century, the number of known biologically active peptides has exponentially increased. They are signaling molecules, participating in all essential aspects of life, from physiological homeostasis (as neuropeptides, peptide hormones, vasoactive peptides), to immunological defense (as MHC class I and II, cytokinins), and as regulatory peptides displaying more than a single action. These peptides result from partial proteolysis of intracellular or extracellular protein precursors performed by several processing enzymes or protease complexes (<b>rennin,</b> kallikreins, calpains, prohormone convertases, proteasomes, endosomes, lysosomes), which convert proteins into peptides, including those with biological activities. The resulting protein fragments of various sizes are either readily degraded into free amino acids, or captured by oligopeptidases, whose peculiar binding and/or catalytic properties allow them to fulfill their physiological roles by trimming inactive peptide precursors leading to their active form, converting bioactive peptides into novel ones., inactivating them, thus restraining the continuous activation of specific receptors, or protecting the newly generated bioactive peptide from further degradation, suggesting a peptide chaperon-like activity. TOP, a ubiquitous cytosolic oligopeptidase, is a remarkable example of how this enzyme could play an essential role in immune defense against cancer cells. It has also been successfully used as a hook to fish novel bioactive peptides from cytosol of cells.|$|E

Crystalline <b>rennin</b> was heterogeneous, and was resolved into six components when analyzed electrophoretically. When crystalline <b>rennin</b> was chromatographed on a column of Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose two distinguishable peaks were observed which corresponded to B- and C-rennin. Unlike crystalline <b>rennin,</b> <b>rennin</b> freshly activated at pH 2. 0 or 5. 0 was essentially homogeneous. <b>Rennin</b> resulting from activation at pH 2. 0 and 5. 0 {{appeared to}} be different. <b>Rennin</b> activated at pH 5. 0 was eluted faster from Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose column, and moved slightly faster in starch-urea-gel electrophoresis, than <b>rennin</b> activated at pH 2. 0. Amino acid analysis showed that <b>rennin</b> activated at pH 2. 0 had more arginine and less proline than that activated at pH 5. 0. This could be accounted for the differences in chromatographic and electrophoretic behavior of these rennins. Crystalline <b>rennin</b> exhibited more resistance to urea denaturation than prorennin. This suggested a fundamental difference in their secondary or (and) tertiary structures. It also showed the importance of intramolecular H-bonding for enzyme activity.

30|$|Milk {{is carried}} {{to the house and}} heated if required. Natural non-standardized <b>rennin</b> is added without measuring, and after the curds set, they are checked for cutting {{resilience}} with a spoon. If ready, they are cut with the spoon and stirred to promote whey separation. The curd is then pressed by hand in the pot. Women dip their hands carefully into the curd and with slow and gentle movements pack the solids together for 20 minutes They say the warmth of their hands helps separate the whey. Then they bring handfuls of solids out of the whey and start compacting it between their hands, above the pot so the whey drips back into it. As soon as they feel it is dry enough they place it into a mould, where they continue to press by hand to make it firmer and give it its final shape. Moulding takes seven to 10 minutes per cheese. Moulds are improvised, made of anything they can find that is round. Of the 10 women who produce cheese, only one had a simple mechanical press. Cheese pieces are approximately 600 [*]g each. They are put into a salt water solution (20 % salt in the summer and 16.6 % in the winter) where they are preserved and stored until sold. Preparing the <b>rennin</b> solution is a complex process that takes a week and requires a fresh suckling kid’s stomach, which they sometimes buy at a market in the city. Constraints as perceived by the producers, in order of importance, are pressing and whey removal, quality and uniformity of <b>rennin,</b> milk temperature at arrival, cheese curdling, and cleanliness.

40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Alge et al. recently reported that urinary renin {{may be a}} prognostic biomarker for AKI after cardiac surgery. However, their urinary renin levels far exceeded published plasma renin levels, whereas normally, urinary renin is, 10 %of plasma renin. This result {{raises questions about the}} specificity of the new Quantikine Renin ELISA Kit used in the work by Alge et al., which is claimed to detect total <b>rennin</b> (i. e., <b>rennin</b> and prorenin). Therefore, this study tested this assay. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Plasma and urine from 30 patients with hypertension, diabetes, or preeclampsia and 10 healthy pregnant women (randomly selected from sample sets obtained earlier to investigate urinary renin-angiotensin system components) were used to compare the ELISA with a validated <b>rennin</b> immunoradiometric assay and an in-house enzyme kinetic assay. Measurements were performed before and after in vitro prorenin activation, representing renin and total renin, respectively. Results Total renin measurements by ELISA, immunoradiometric assay, and enzyme kinetic assay were highly correlated. However, ELISA results were consistently $ 10 -fold higher. The ELISA standard yielded low to undetectable levels in the immunoradiometric assay and enzyme kinetic assay, except after prorenin activation, when the results were $ 10 -fold lower than the ELISA results. In plasma, prorenin activation increased ELISA results by 10 %– 15 %. Urine contained no detectable prorenin. Conclusions The ELISA renin kit standard is prorenin, and its immunoreactivity and enzymatic activity after conversion to renin do not match the International Reference Preparation of human renin that has been used to validate previous immunoradiometric assays and enzyme kinetic assays; in fact, they are at least 10 -fold lower, and thus, any measurements obtained with this ELISA kit yield levels that are at least 10 -fold too high. The ELISA antibodies detect both renin and prorenin, with a preference for the former. Given these inconsistencies, urinary <b>rennin</b> levels should be measured by established renin assays...|$|E

While B. subtilis (natto) produces many enzymes, including amylases and cellulases, the most important enzymes in the production of natto are proteases; many of them have been characterized (Yoshimoto et al. 1971). The proteases are responsible for the main flavor, through hydrolysis of soybean protein. It is conceivable that B. subtilis (natto) may produce MCE(s). Recently, we have shown that Bacillus subtilis (natto) Takahashi produced milk clotting enzyme (MCE). The Milk-clotting activity (MCA) and milk-clotting activity/proteolytic activity (MCA/PA) ratio of the crude enzyme obtained are comparable with those of Pfizer microbial <b>rennin</b> and Mucor <b>rennin</b> (Shieh et al. 2009).|$|E
40|$|In {{a review}} of {{literature}} on the subject, etiology, pathophysiology, methods of blood pressure measurement and clinical aspects of hypertension in children are discussed. The measurement of blood pressure in children over 2 years of age as a routine procedure in ambulatory examination is emphasized. Despite controversial views expressed {{on the value of}} "Report of the task force on blood pressure control in children "Indicating blood pressures over 90 th percentile for sex and age as actual hypertension, this standardization remains practicable. The incidence of hypertension in children compared with adults is lower. It is often caused by a primary curable disease. Renal parenchymal disease and renovascular lesions are the most frequently encountered causes. The measurement of arterial blood pressure with Doppler ultrasound technique is the most precise non-invasive method and the values approach those of intraarterial pressures. In evaluating hypertensive children, screening studies such as urinalysis, serum electrolytes, BUN, serum creatinine, Hb, Hct and eventually EKG as well as echocardiography have to be performed routinely.
