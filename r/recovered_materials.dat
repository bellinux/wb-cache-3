5|$|Of the <b>recovered</b> <b>materials,</b> a {{fraction}} {{has been given}} to the New Mexico Museum of Space History for display, and another 100 to the documentary producers Lightbox and Fuel Entertainment. Galea believes the remaining cartridges can be sold by the city of Alamogordo through the Museum of Space History. She hopes that the sale of these games can help fund recognition of the burial site as a tourist attraction in the future. The City of Alamogordo approved the auction of the games in September 2014, to be sold through eBay and the Alamogordo Council website. As of September 2015, over $107,000 has been raised through the sales of about 880 unearthed cartridges, with one E.T. copy selling for more than $1,500. About 300 cartridges remain to be sold at a later date given the historical value of the cartridges.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we combine a simple {{recovery}} mechanism for ellipsis with a general, discourse account of parallelism {{to account for}} a variety of phenomena concerning ellipsis, including Sag's wide scope puzzle and complex examples concerning sloppy identity. Our recovery mechanism requires an identity of logical structure between the <b>recovered</b> <b>material</b> and antecedent in the ellipsis. The <b>recovered</b> <b>material</b> and the antecedent are then interpreted independently in their respective contexts, subject only to the general discourse constraints on parallelism. These constraints give a uniform account of parallelism facts, {{whether or not there is}} ellipsis...|$|R
30|$|During the {{production}} process, the boards made from <b>recovered</b> non-metallic <b>materials</b> were more easily shaped and flattened than {{the boards of}} talc and silica. The mixing time was also significantly reduced and the mixture was more uniform and reliable than the mixture of silica and talc. These improvements {{can be attributed to}} the good affinity between the <b>recovered</b> <b>material</b> and the resin-based adhesive (Mou et al. 2007).|$|R
50|$|The United States Army re{{garrison}}ed {{the fort}} until March 19, 1869, when the garrison {{was transferred to}} Fort McKavett.

50|$|The Akogi to Takajaya {{section was}} double-tracked in 1909, with the Matsusaka to Tokuwa section double-tracked two years later.

50|$|These {{batteries}} include but are {{not limited}} to: car batteries, golf cart batteries, UPS batteries, industrial fork-lift batteries, motorcycle batteries, and commercial batteries. These can be regular lead-acid, sealed lead-acid, gel type, or absorbed glass mat batteries. These are recycled by grinding them, neutralizing the acid, and separating the polymers from the lead. The <b>recovered</b> <b>materials</b> are used in a variety of applications, including new batteries.|$|E

50|$|Over 50 {{years passed}} {{until the next}} series of excavations, when in 1961 and 1962 the Ethiopian Institute of Archeology {{sponsored}} an expedition led by Francis Anfray. This excavation not only <b>recovered</b> <b>materials</b> showing a strong affinities with the late Axumite kingdom, but a destruction layer. This in turn prompted Kobishchanov to later argue that Adulis had been destroyed by an Arab raid in the mid-7th century, a view that has since been partially rejected.|$|E
50|$|O'Rourke first joined Christchurch City Council in 1989 as a {{representative}} of the Labour Party and served for 15 years until 2004. For many years, he chaired the Sustainable Transport and Utilities Committee, and under his chairmanship, the Blenheim Road deviation and the four-laning of Fendalton Road were major council projects. He championed unpopular projects like the Kate Valley Landfill and set up the <b>Recovered</b> <b>Materials</b> Foundation, which represented the start of kerbside recycling in Christchurch.|$|E
50|$|This archaeological site, {{located on}} the left bank of the Litani was studied in 1965-66 by Lorraine Copeland and Peter Wescombe. Materials found {{included}} flints used for heavy chopping including trapezoidal, oval and rectangular shaped axes. A few sickle blades with fine denticulation along with some scrapers and an oval shaped arrowhead were found. Analysis of the <b>recovered</b> <b>materials</b> enabled Jacques Cauvin and Marie-Claire Cauvin {{to suggest that the}} site was contemporary with the earliest neolithic levels at Byblos.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{were able}} to {{identify}} the point of origin of the disintegration as an area immediately ahead of {{the leading edge of the}} aircraft's right wing. The <b>material</b> <b>recovered</b> from Kure Beach, including a portion of the wing fillet, was from this general area. Investigators were unable to <b>recover</b> <b>material</b> from an irregular, triangularly shaped area positioned above the leading edge and extending forward ahead of the wing.|$|R

50|$|In Australia, every urban {{domestic}} household {{is provided}} with three bins: one for recycling; another for general waste; and another for garden materials, this bin {{is provided by the}} municipality if requested. To encourage recycling, municipalities provide large recycle bins, which are larger than general waste bins. Many American localities have dual-stream recycling, with paper collected in bags or boxes and all other materials in a recycling bin. In either case, the <b>recovered</b> <b>materials</b> are trucked to a materials recovery facility for further processing.|$|E
50|$|Based on the <b>recovered</b> <b>materials,</b> it {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that the Stone Bowl peoples also practiced irrigation and cultivated grains such as millet, eleusine (savanna grass), and sorghum. Sonia Mary Cole (1954) indicates that certain pestles and grindstones that she excavated from ochreous levels were stained with ochre, while others from the carbonized layers were not. She consequently suggests that the latter were instead used for grinding grain. Other scholars have argued {{that there is no}} direct archaeological evidence that the Savanna Pastoral Neolithic peoples cultivated grains or other plant domesticates.|$|E
50|$|In 1995, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{implemented}} the Comprehensive Procurement Guideline (CPG) program to promote waste reduction and resource conservation {{through the use}} of materials recovered from solid waste, and to ensure that the materials collected in recycling programs will be used again in the manufacture of new products. The EPA is required to designate products that are or can be made with <b>recovered</b> <b>materials,</b> and to recommend practices for buying these products. Once a product is designated, state and federal procuring agencies are required to purchase it with the highest recovered material content level practicable.|$|E
