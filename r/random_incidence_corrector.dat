The model allows for anisotropic flow resistivity, tortuosity and elastic moduli. Implicit to the theory is a characteristic dispersion relation of sixth order that yields the allowed wave numbers for wave propagation in anisotropic elastic porous media. In addition, explicit expressions for field variables such as displacements and stresses appropriate for anisotropic foams are derived. Predictions of <b>random</b> <b>incidence</b> sound transmission loss for double panels with anisotropic linings have been performed.

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{possibility}} of using the two-microphone sound intensity technique to measure the normal <b>incidence</b> and the <b>random</b> <b>incidence</b> sound absorption coefficient was investigated. The normal incidence absorption coefficient was determined by measuring the intensity incidence on the sample and the intensity reflected by the sample placed in an anechoic chamber. The <b>random</b> <b>incidence</b> absorption coefficient was determined by measuring the intensity incident on the sample and the intensity reflected by the sample placed in a reverberation chamber. Absorption coefficient results obtained by the sound intensity technique were compared with standard techniques, namely the reverberation chamber and the standing wave tube. The major advantages of using the sound intensity technique are that it permits 'in situ' measurements and the absorption coefficient for a large range of frequencies can be obtained from a single measurement...|$|R

40|$|Sound {{transmission}} through double-shell {{composite structures}} sandwiched with poroelastic cores {{in the presence}} of an external mean flow is studied analytically with the focus on the effects of <b>random</b> <b>incidence</b> in a diffuse field. The shell motions are described by Love's theory, and the poroelastic core is modelled as an equivalent fluid by considering only the dominant wave based on Biot's theory. The transfer matrix method is employed to solve the vibroacoustic problem with appropriate boundary conditions. The total transmission loss in the diffuse field is calculated numerically for three sandwich configurations over a wide frequency range, and the limiting incidence angle due to total internal reflection is analysed. The numerical results suggest that the effects of the direction angles and external mean flow on the transmission loss and characteristic frequencies observed for a fixed incidence direction have been averaged after integrating over all <b>random</b> <b>incidence</b> directions. Both the poroelastic core and air gap significantly improve the sound insulation performance particularly in the mass-law region, and airborne waves are preferable to frame waves to be insulated by the double-shell sandwich structures...|$|R

Using the 1999 size distribution of health-care expenditures for the 45 ­ 64 year-old Manitoba population, we show that MSA allowances save the government $ 42 per capita under the most favourable assumptions, but that, under more realistic assumptions, they are consistently more costly than medicare. ...|$|R
