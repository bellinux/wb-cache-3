30|$|The {{literature}} in this topic provides numerous examples supporting {{the need for}} consideration of more variables when attempting to answer that question. Furthermore, many articles support the future opportunity aspect. For example, Caruso (2010) highlights that the future, with its higher controllability, gives the person the impression of being able and, most importantly, being <b>responsible</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the negative outcome. Following this logical reasoning, emotional reactions to future events must be more extreme than the reactions to past events, where the responsibility to change the outcome diminishes with the inability to change the past. This would contradict the argument that future opportunities would elicit feelings of hope, as stated by Beike et al. (2008). In several experiments, Caruso (2010) provides evidence for this theory. This author shows that people feel the urge to prevent future unfairness. In his experiments, the participants were more willing to make financial sacrifices {{in order to prevent}} future unfairness than past unfairness in scenarios such as judging transgressors in a lawsuit. In Caruso’s study, (2010) the intensity levels of emotions proved to be saliently higher for future events than the emotional reactions were for past events.|$|E

40|$|As European governments rapidly {{turn their}} {{attention}} to the implementation of the EU-Turkey agreement, this thesis raises significant questions regarding refugees’ access to international protection. At its core, the agreement aims to address the flow of irregular migrants and asylum seekers traveling across the Mediterranean from Turkey to Greece, by allowing returns of “all irregular migrants”. The aim of this thesis has been to examine if these actions limit two fundamental refugee rights; the right to seek asylum and the principle of non-refoulement. If so, are these restrictions legitimate according to Seyla Benhabib’s and Joseph Carens’ theory? These two theoreticians have been chosen because they problematize the conflicting view of state sovereignty in relation to refugees’ rights. This is significant when the state maintains border control and is <b>responsible</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> refugees from entering the state. This thesis shows that the EU-Turkey agreement is not compatible with the practical obligations of states under international law and the European Union asylum policy, simply because Turkey is not a safe third country for refugees to be sent back to. Thus, the actions within the agreement does restrict refugees’ right to seek asylum and the principle of non-refoulement. These restrictions cannot be considered legitimate, based on the thesis’ theoretical approach. To study the EU-Turkey agreement involves addressing one of the most urgent topics in international law and political theory, as well as providing normative grounds for future migration agreements between states. ...|$|E

In previous research {{it has been argued}} that one should separate cyberbullying and traditional bullying both in definitional and measurements issues. However, in Swedish school, there are no marked differences between the two forms of bullying, teachers are <b>responsible</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> them both. The research is based on 3925 students in years 3 - 9 (1950 girls and 1975 boys) in 19 schools in the Gothenburg region and two from the Stockholm region. The students have taken a digital survey at school, regarding both traditional and cyber bullying. The main method used in the study was factor analysis (PCA). Analyses were conducted in SPSS. The results show that items used to represent traditional and cyber bullying load on one and the same factor. The more in-depth questions about cyber bullying shows that the most common experience of cyber bullying is to receive messages that are difficult to interpret. According to those who experience this kind of bullying, the spread of cyber bullying is relatively small and only some people at school know that they are bullied online. Generally, the bullying greatly affects the students' everyday life and they report that they feel unsure and less likely to trust others. To be exposed to bullying can generally be seen as being in a situation where threats and unbalanced power structures occur. Cyber bullying for young people has become traditional and is one indicator of bullying in schools...|$|E
40|$|M Public Administration (Development and Management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 This {{study is}} an {{evaluation}} of the grant application process of the South African Social Security Agency in Gauteng, West Rand District. The aim of the study is to determine if there are inefficiencies and incompetence within the system that can make it susceptible to fraud. Another aim of the study is to propose mechanisms to minimise the inefficiencies in the grant application process so that clients can receive the correct grant at the right time and at the designated collection point. SASSA is <b>responsible</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> unauthorised and wasteful expenditure, and ensure that the state resources are managed and utilised in an effective and efficient manner in compliance with the Public Finance Management Act of 2000. There is also a responsibility to protect the poor and vulnerable. Curbing inefficiencies will gain the citizens confidence in the services offered by the Agency. A clear explanation of the concept administration as a mechanism for the implementation of policy, management (and its functions), monitoring, reporting and evaluation is provided. This is followed by a discussion on the legislative framework, policies, regulations and procedures which guide the management of the grant application process. Furthermore, the assumptions underlying the dominant schools of thought on the theories of public administration and alternative definitions of the phenomenon are expounded upon. The study outlines factors that lead officials to deviate from the grant application regulations and procedure which render the system inefficient and ineffective. It also reveals the extent of deviations and non-compliance during the completion of grant applications, the calculation and the capturing of the means test, and approval of grant applications which is a major challenge for SASSA. Several types of behaviour observed and activities performed by officials are identified, all of which have a bearing on how inefficiencies are perceived. There is also evidence that some of the activities are acts of fraud which may {{have a negative impact on}} the image of the Agency and service delivery. But the officials‟ attitude to the possibility of fraud increasing seems to be overly sanguine, partly as a result of a very narrow definition of fraud. The study further provides an analysis of the reasons the grant application strategies in place are not successfully implemented by the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA). The study concludes with the implementation of best practice in terms of management strategies and good governance, and an alternative framework that locates fraud at the systemic level is proposed. Vigilance could be enhanced by strengthening supervisory capacity, enhancing the social pension (SOCPEN) system and internal audit. Furthermore, officials who are found guilty of fraudulent activities must be prosecuted within the shortest time period and not be suspended with full pay. Master...|$|E

40|$|Allergic {{eye disease}} {{encompasses}} {{a group of}} hypersensitivity disorders which primarily affect the conjunctiva and its prevalence is increasing. It is estimated to affect 8 % of patients attending optometric practice but is poorly managed and rarely involves ophthalmic assessment. Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) {{is the most common}} form of allergic eye disease (90 %), followed by perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC; 5 %). Both are type 1 IgE mediated hypersensitivity reactions where mast cells play an important role in pathophysiology. The signs and symptoms are similar but SAC occurs periodically whereas PAC occurs year round. Despite being a relatively mild condition, the effects on the quality of life can be profound and therefore they demand attention. Primary management of SAC and PAC involves avoidance strategies depending on the <b>responsible</b> allergen(s) <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the hypersensitivity reaction. Cooled tear supplements and cold compresses may help bring relief. Pharmacological agents may become necessary as it is not possible to completely avoid the allergen(s). There are a wide range of anti-allergic medications available, such as mast cell stabilisers, antihistamines and dual-action agents. Severe cases refractory to conventional treatment require anti-inflammatories, immunomodulators or immunotherapy. Additional qualifications are required to gain access to these medications, but entry-level optometrists must offer advice and supportive therapy. Based on current evidence, the efficacy of anti-allergic medications appears equivocal so prescribing should relate to patient preference, dosing and cost. More studies with standardised methodologies are necessary elicit the most effective anti-allergic medications but those with dual-actions are likely to be first line agents. © 2011 British Contact Lens Association...|$|R

40|$|Background: The occumulation {{of heavy}} metals which are as {{the results of}} industrial, urban and {{agricultural}} sewages are usually resistant to chemical dissociation. They can easily contaminate aquatic animals especially shrimps which {{are one of the}} food chains of humans. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the concentration of heavy metals in the tissues of different types of shrimps (wild and farmed) in the sea waters of province of Bushehr (Persian Gulf). Material and Methods: Wild shrimps from different areas of the province and also three types of farmed shrimps including Ferropenaeus, penaeus semisulcatus and Litopenaeusvannamei were caught and collected. Then cleaned, washed, dried and made into powder and then made into ash in a furnace at 550 °C. Heavy metals including Pb, Cd, Hg, Cu, and Zn were measured by atomic absorption flame photometry. Results: The mean values of the concentration of the heavy metals including Pb, Cd, Zn, and Cu present in the wild shrimps were, 2. 86, 9. 53, 0. 45, 1. 36 ppm respectively. The amount of Hg found to be 2. 8 ppb. Also the mean values of the concentration of the heavy metals in the farmed shrimps were measured as 3, 9. 8, 0. 42 and 1. 37 ppm respectively and the amount of Hg was 2. 7 ppb. There was no difference between the amount of heavy metals estimated in the tissues from wild shrimps and the farmed one. Conclusion: The results of this investigation showed that the concentration of heavy metals including Zn,Cu and Hg in both types of the shrimps were less than the amounts reported by WHO and so not risky for health. However the concentration of Pb and Cd in both types were more than the recommended consumption limit for the humans, and they can be considered as risk factors for many diseases.

40|$|The Billings Complex and the Guarapiranga System are {{important}} strategic reservoirs {{for the city}} of Sao Paulo and surrounding areas because the water is used among other things, for the public water supply. They produce 19, 000 liters of water per second and Supply water to 5. 4 million people. Crude water is transferred from the Taquacetuba branch of the Billings Complex to the Guarapiranga Reservoir to regulate the water level of the reservoir. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the water quality in the Taquacetuba branch, focusing on cyanobacteria and cyanotoxins. Surface water samples were collected in February (summer) and July (winter) of 2007. Analyses were conducted of physical, chemical, and biological variables of he water, cyanobacteria richness and density, and the presence of cyanotoxins. The water was classified as eutrophic-hypereutrophic. Cyanobacteria blooms were observed in both collection periods. The cyanobacteria bloom was most significant in July, reflecting lower water transparency and higher levels of total solids, suspended organic matter, chlorophyll-a, and cyanobacteria density in the surface water. Low richness and elevated dominance of the cyanobacteria were found in both periods. Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii was dominant in February, with 352 661. 0 cel mL(- 1), and Microcystis panniformis was dominant in July, with 1 866 725. 0 cel mL(- 1). Three variants of microcystin were found in February (MC-RR, MC-LR, MC-YR), as well as saxitoxin. The same variants of microcystin were found in July, but no saxitoxin was detected. Anatoxin-a and cylindropermopsin were not detected in either period.
