Dutch beer brewer Heineken submitted the question of estimating the {{returnable packaging}} materials to the 2013 Studygroup Mathe-matics with Industry. In this report, we present both stochastic flow models and a queueing model to estimate the amount of <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>material</b> present in the market. Furthermore, we give recommendations on what data to collect, and how to sample this data in an unbiased way in order to increase accuracy of the estimation.

30|$|In recent years, {{researchers}} have developed models that assist decision makers in planning the purchase, distribution and return of reusable packaging material. However, {{as will be}} shown in the next section, publications in this area had a focus on conceptual models of RTI management, {{on the use of}} radio-frequency identification (RFID) in the management of RTIs and on container routing and repositioning models. Models that consider the different logistical costs {{associated with the use of}} RTIs as well as the interdependencies that arise between the management of RTIs and the distribution of finished products, in contrast, have not been proposed thus far. To close this gap, this paper studies a supplier who uses <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>material</b> for supplying a product to multiple customers. The objective is to develop a mathematical model that helps decision makers in coordinating the flow of finished products and RTIs along the supply chain and to minimize the total logistics cost of the chain.|$|E
40|$|Report no. E 2016 : 009, Volvo Cars {{handles and}} plans its own <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>material</b> {{and the purpose}} is to serve the suppliers, plants and {{terminals}} with packaging material like pallets, boxes and frames. Returnable packaging is made out of durable materials so it can be used several times. To be able to in time serve the production plants with packaging material the company needs to make calculations based on real factors and numbers. One of the tasks for the department Packaging Operations is to secure the packaging availability. If there is shortage of packaging it can cause a stop in the production line and this is caused because the suppliers are short of packaging to pack their products on, which can cause delays in the production. To prevent this problem, the department has developed a calculation model in Excel to calculate the required packaging in circulation for different time periods and the outcome is an investment sum. This model is based on three variables: production volume, loop time and packaging per car. The last variable defines the amount of packaging needed to manufacture one car model and loop time is the time it takes for one packaging to travel from the terminal to the supplier, from the supplier to the plants and finally back to the terminal before it is sent out again. However, the department saw an opportunity to develop this model with more accurate numbers and data, make it more user-friendly and general so the data and assumptions could be updated easily. The purpose of this thesis was to improve and verify the original model and the wanted outcome was to develop a new model and make it useful according to two perspectives. The short-term perspective that the model will achieve is to secure packaging availability and make investments in time to always be able to serve the suppliers with packaging. Moreover, the long-term perspective is to plan the cost for future car models and the time span for this is over three years from now. Today there is lack of reliable data at the department to get an understanding if there is enough packaging in circulation and to decide the cost for future car models, so the new model will fulfil both these perspectives. Using information from an analysis of the original model, requirements for the new model and by making a gap analysis between the original model and the requirements developed the new model. First, the new model consists of two documents, one to calculate packaging per car and the other to calculate the investment sum. Both of the documents are improved and are now more general than the original model, the raw data can be updated easily and the calculations will automatically using the updated data and present it. Another improvement is that the assumptions for example loop time can be regulated at any time and the calculations will adjust to the changes automatically. A user manual exists to facilitate the transfer of knowledge to the concerned department. However, it is a prerequisite that the user has prior knowledge about the organization and processes to also evaluate the outcome’s reliability. There are some improvement potentials and weaknesses to further consider for Volvo Cars. The purpose of this thesis was to develop a model and not to evaluate the numbers used in the model. However, the raw data changes frequently and thus the investment sum. A first step to increase the reliability of the investment sum is to verify the numbers and assumptions. In conclusion, a functioning model is delivered to Volvo Cars, but the numbers need to be evaluated and analysed to be able to trust the investment su...|$|E
40|$|Reverse {{logistics}} {{is considered}} to be the key for re-manufacturing and sustainable development. It has gained increasing attention in the last decade and has been a new frontier of strategic management. One of the driving forces for firms to adopt the reverse logistics practice is cost saving from reverse logistics activities. Another motivation to put reverse logistics forward is probably due to environmental impacts on non-returnable materials. Reverse logistics, however, may require cooperation of more than one company and hence it is generally poorly managed due to self-interest of different companies. Therefore, a pro-active and collaborative approach to reverse logistics is demanded. This paper reports a case study of using <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> between a manufacturer and an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supplier. A cross-company team was established to pursue the goal of the reverse logistics project. Tangible and intangible benefits of reverse logistics from this case study are presented in this paper...|$|R

Sources also propose that <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> is dealt with inefficiently within the automotive suppliers.    Purpose The purpose of the thesis is to explore and analyze how <b>packaging</b> and <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> are managed within suppliers in the ASC. It also aims to identify perceived important factors for efficient <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> management from the perspective of suppliers, sub-suppliers and OEMs. Method The research is based on a holistic single case study. Further, it adopts the inductive approach and exploratory purpose. Data collection is facilitated by qualitative methods, using ten semi-structured interviews and four on-site observations. Conclusion Packaging was found to be managed somewhat differently in the internal, outbound and inbound flows. Non-returnable and <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> was found used in all flows at different ratios. Further, several factors were regarded important for efficient <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> management. These were found specific for the internal, outbound and inbound flows and further divided into fundamental and efficiency factors...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{this paper}} The purpose {{of this paper}} is to develop an {{evaluation}} model comparing a one-way with a <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> system from a supply chain perspective. Design/methodology/approach A theoretical evaluation model for comparing cost efficiency and environmental impact of one-way and <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> systems in supply chains is developed from literature. The deducted model is subsequently tested in a case study of a supply chain involving Volvo Car Corporation and Volvo Logistics Corporation, comparing the use of a newly developed one-way packaging with the sustainability of a <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging.</b> Findings The developed theoretical model showed to be useful to compare the environmental and economic impact of two different packaging systems in a specific supply chain. The criteria used in the model are 1) packaging efficiency, 2) <b>packaging</b> <b>material,</b> 3) transport, 4) material handling, 5) waste, recycling and reuse, and 6) administration. In the case study, the one-way packaging resulted in less economic and environmental impact, indicating the importance for companies to question their packaging systems. Research limitations/implications The model only has been tested on one component in a case study. The model provides comparative, but not absolute, figures. Practical implications Managers can use the packaging evaluation model to compare different packaging systems for a component and determine the most sustainable packaging from an environmental and economic perspective. The case study indicated that the <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> system commonly used in the automotive industry is not always preferable in terms of sustainability.

40|$|Lack of {{appropriate}} {{policy is the}} main constraint to sustainable waste management in Malaysia. As a result, the Solid Waste and Public Cleansing Management Bill (SWPCM) was approved in 2007. Its aims are to provide an act and regulate the manag ement of solid waste and public cleansing {{in order to maintain}} proper sanitation in the country. The Bill provides for the administrative bodies authorized in MSW management and the tribunal for solid waste management services. The objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the perception of the public in regards to the current waste management system in the country and future waste management, particularly in relation to SWPCM Bill 2007. To accomplish this, questionnaires consisting of 45 questions were randomly distributed to 694 respondents to obtain 96 % confidence level. Data collected were analyzed using SPSS. Results indicated that 86 % of the public is satisfied with the current waste management system. The high satisfactory level probably is related to the fact that only reliable waste management contractors are appointed and renewed after an interim period. Contracts of waste managers with high number of complaints will not be renewed and they are directed to stop their collection services. Since the passing of the Bill, government had declared that unsatisfactory contractors will be terminated from their contract once the SWPCM Bill 2007 is enforced. However, 13 % is dissatisfied with the collection frequency. The public (67 - 78 %) has relatively high knowledge on the waste management issues such as final disposal option of the municipal solid waste and others. However, the majority of the public (69 %) are not aware of the existence of SWPCM Bill 2007 and its passing by the parliament in August 2007. This is mainly due to the absence of notification to the general public from the ministry level. Responses from public regarding the deposit refund system was mainly negative where majority (87 %) disagreed to pay deposit for <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> <b>materials</b> as allocated in Part X of the Bill. This is due to the fact that the system is currently absent in the country and its introduction will affect the consumers’ economy as they will lose the deposits if they did not return the materials to the manufacturer. The majority (64 %) of the respondents agreed with the regulation of segregation at source. This probably is due to the high awareness on waste disposal issues. Various campaigns were aired in mass-media indicating the deteriorating quality of the environment due to the indiscriminate disposal of MSW into landfill. Nevertheless, 97 % are confident that the Bill will improve the current waste management system and able to promote a more sustainable solid waste management system for the country...|$|R

40|$|Currently the {{performance}} of a traditional forward supply chain is broadly studied in literature. The less known reverse supply chain is an upcoming research theme, with more companies adapting this concept. In the beverages industry this reverse logistics are common and based on <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging,</b> so called empties. Beer brewers are {{under a lot of pressure}} and cost reductions are essential to remain competitive and to survive. This research aims at creating knowledge on redesigning a reverse supply chain driven by <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> from a transport logistic perspective. This research is performed based on a proposed method called DMADE. The research problem is identified as a lack of knowledge on redesigning of a reverse supply chain driven by <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging.</b> Literature is researched and a new process improvement method called VSM-I is introduced. This combines both physical values streams with information flow swimlanes. Performance measures are defined for the reverse flow. A case study is performed and the current state of the supply chain at Heineken is created. By analyzing this current state, waste that obstruct improved performance is identified. 4 New transport logistic strategies are introduced based on the analysis. The current state transport strategy, Strategy 1; the triple trip, Strategy 2; Direct trip from market to sorter and Strategy 3; a direct trip the market with sorted empties to the production warehouse(LCDB). A discrete event simulation model is constructed to evaluate {{the performance}} based on an experimental plan. The 4 transport strategies with each 10 input scenarios that capture potential growth, new processing times and other mix of sorted and unsorted empties returned. They are tested based on cycle time, throughput, CO 2 emission, inventory utilization, handling cost and storage cost. The transport strategies show that introducing Strategy 3; direct trip from the market to the LCDB is the most beneficial for cycle time reduction and increase in throughput. Depending on the input scenario up to 3. 36 weeks € 2. 359 k of cycle time can be reduced and an increase of 4, 3 % in throughput is realized. Strategy 1; the triple trip reduces 165 tons of CO 2 emission per year. Strategy 2; direct trip from the market to Leiter performs the best handling and storage cost reduction with respective € 231 k & € 373 k savings. Inventory utilization results show a shift of inventory to other locations in the supply chain since no changes to the initial inventory levels are made when changing transport strategies. A supply chain driven by <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> can be redesigned from a transport logistic perspective with a structured method called DMADE. When combining this method with a new introduced process improvement method called VSM-I a more detailed current state analysis can be performed.
