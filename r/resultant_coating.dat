In {{the case of the}} nodavirus Flock House virus (FHV), a bipartite positive-strand RNA genome consisting of RNA 1 and RNA 2 is copackaged into progeny virions. In this study, we investigated whether the specific packaging of FHV RNA is dependent on an arginine-rich motif (ARM) located in the N terminus of the coat protein. Our results demonstrate that the replacement of all arginine residues within this motif with alanines rendered the <b>resultant</b> <b>coat</b> protein unable to package RNA 1, suggesting that the ARM represents an important determinant for the encapsidation of this genome segment. In contrast, replacement of all arginines with lysines had no effect on RNA 1 packaging. Interestingly, confocal microscopic analysis demonstrated that the RNA 1 packaging-deficient mutant did not localize to mitochondrial sites of FHV RNA replication as efficiently as wild-type coat protein. In addition, gain-of-function analyses showed that the ARM by itself was sufficient to target green fluorescent protein to RNA replication sites. These data suggest that the packaging of RNA 1 is dependent on trafficking of coat protein to mitochondria, the presumed site of FHV assembly, and that this trafficking requires a high density of positive charge in the N terminus.

40|$|The work {{presented}} here provides greater {{insight into the}} occurrence of the main inorganic elements in algae and how this varies for different species of algae and production methods. It also provides valuable insights into the behavior of algal ashes during combustion, particularly in regard to their interaction with quartz bed material, which is of direct relevance to agglomeration in fluidized bed reactors. A diverse range of algal species was selected for this work using a species of marine microalgae (Tetraselmis sp.) and marine macroalgae (Derbesia tenuissima) and a species of freshwater macroalgae (Oedogonium sp.). Two samples of Oedogonium were tested. One sample was cultivated using a standard nutrient addition regime, {{and the other was}} starved of essential nutrients at the completion of the culture cycle. Samples of algae were subject to chemical fractionation and the mode of occurrence of the main inorganic elements was inferred from their leaching behavior. Both the relative proportions of the main inorganic elements in the algae and their mode of occurrence are largely dependent on the culturing environment and harvesting history. The leaching behavior of the inorganic elements indicates a high level of inorganic, water-soluble, alkali salts in all of the tested algae. In order to simulate ash interactions with bed particles during fluidized bed combustion, pellets consisting of algal ashes mixed with quartz particles were heated in a muffle furnace at 850 °C in air. Scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy analyses were performed on cross sections of the resultant samples. Melted ash coatings had formed on the surfaces of the quartz particles. In all cases {{there was no evidence of}} chemical reactions between the ashes and quartz particles. Melt-induced agglomeration appeared to be the principal agglomeration mechanism. The ashes from the two marine algae both formed salt-type melts. The ashes from the Oedogonium sample, which had been starved of essential nutrients during cultivation, formed a silicate-type melt. The <b>resultant</b> ash <b>coating</b> consisted of melted, Ca-rich, K–silicate. The Oedogonium sample grown under a standard nutrient addition regime had higher levels of P in its inorganic matter. The increased P content appeared to have a significant influence on the composition and adhesive behavior of the formed melt.

40|$|The prime design {{considerations}} for modern nickel based superalloys {{for use in}} aero gas-turbine engines, are those of mechanical performance, namely good resistance to creep and fatigue with good toughness and microstructural phase stability. Design of {{the current generation of}} superalloys has attained these properties at the expense of environmental resistance. This design philosophy has lead to the widespread use of surface coatings technology to protect hot-section componentry from the harsh operating environment. The ongoing drive towards higher operating temperatures has lead to an interest, over the last few years, in thermal barrier coatings (TBCs). TBCs are duplex coating systems consisting of a thin, insulating, ceramic layer over a metallic bondcoat. The bondcoat provides both environmental protection and the necessary adhesive interface to maintain the adherence of the ceramic during the rigours of operation. Central to the performance of a TBC system is the integrity and adherence of the alumina scale promoted by the bondcoat. This study aimed to design and optimise a novel bondcoat system that was capable of out-performing the current generation of bondcoats and progress the <b>resultant</b> <b>coating</b> into a production ready status.

In all cases the coating renders the surface of the glass more adhesive to the cold end coating. At the cold end a layer of typically, polyethylene wax, is applied via a water based emulsion. This makes the glass slippery, protecting it from scratching and stopping containers from sticking together when they are moved on a conveyor. The <b>resultant</b> invisible combined <b>coating</b> gives a virtually unscratchable surface to the glass. Due to reduction of in-service surface damage, the coatings often are described as strengtheners, however a more correct definition might be strength-retaining coatings.|$|R
40|$|Background: Bovine {{trypanosomosis}} is {{a serious}} constraint to agricultural production in extensive areas of Ethiopia. Methodology: A cross-sectional {{study was conducted to}} determine the prevalence of bovine infection with trypanosomes and to identify the prevailed trypanosome species in three districts of the East Gojjam zone bordering the Blue Nile River from March 2005 to February 2006. Cattle from 9 different localities were checked using microscopical examination of wet blood smears, thin and stained bloodsmears, and by blood centrifugation followed by the examination of the <b>resultant</b> buffy <b>coats.</b> Result: Of the total 3, 360 cattle investigated, 8. 2 % (3. 5 %, 11. 6 % and 9. 4 % from Dejen, Machakel and Baso-Liben districts respectively) were found to be infected with trypanosomes. Of the total 275 positive animals, 249 (90. 5 %) appeared to be infected with Trypanosoma vivax; 11 (4 %) were infected with T. congolense; and 15 (5. 5 %) were infected with mixed infection of T. vivax and T. congolense. The prevalence of infection with T. vivax was significantly higher than that of T. congolense (P < 0. 001). Taking 24 - 46 % as normal PCV value, the mean PCV for the trypanosome-infected cattle (22. 09 %) was lower than those for the trypanosome-negative animals (26. 03). Conclusion: Trypanosomosis is a disease of considerable importance to the major economic districts bordering the Blue Nile River of the East Gojjam zone, Ethiopia, given the disease’s potential to threaten the health and productivity of cattle in this region...|$|R
