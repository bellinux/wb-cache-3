In this paper, we expand {{the role of}} the <b>fill</b> <b>unit</b> to include four dynamic optimizations: (1) Register move instructions are explicitly marked, enabling them to be executed within the decode logic. (2) Immediate values of dependent instructions are combined, if possible, which removes a step in the dependency chain. (3) Dependent pairs of shift and add instructions are combined into scaled add instructions. (4) Instructions are arranged within the trace segment to minimize the impact of the latency through the operand bypass network.

40|$|This work {{examines}} dynamic cluster {{assignment for}} a clustered trace cache processor (CTCP). Previously pro-posed cluster assignment techniques run into unique prob-lems as issue width and cluster count increase. Realistic design conditions, such as variable data forwarding laten-cies between clusters and a heavily partitioned instruction window, increase {{the degree of}} difficulty for effective cluster assignment. In this work, the trace cache and <b>fill</b> <b>unit</b> are used to per-form dynamic cluster assignment. The retire-time <b>fill</b> <b>unit</b> analysis is aided by a dynamic profiling mechanism em-bedded within the trace cache. This mechanism provides information about inter-trace data dependencies, an ele-ment absent in previous retire-time CTCP cluster assign-ment work. The strategy proposed in this work leads to more intra-cluster data forwarding and shorter data forwarding distances. In addition, performing cluster assignment at re-tire time reduces issue-time complexity and eliminates early pipeline stages. This increases overall performance for in-teger programs by 11. 5 % over our base CTCP architecture. This speedup is significantly higher than a previously pro-posed retire-time CTCP assignment strategy. Dynamic clus-ter assignment is also evaluated for several alternate cluster designs {{as well as for}} media benchmarks. 1...|$|R

40|$|As superscalar {{processors}} {{become increasingly}} wide, {{it is inevitable}} that the large set of instructions to be fetched every cycle will span multiple noncontiguous basic blocks. The mechanism to fetch, align, and pass this set of instructions down the pipeline must do so as efficiently as possible. The concept of trace cache has emerged as the most promising technique to meet this high-bandwidth, low-latency fetch requirement. A new <b>fill</b> <b>unit</b> scheme, the Sliding Window Fill Mechanism, is proposed as a method to efficiently populate the trace cache. This method exploits trace continuity and identifies probable start regions to improve trace cache hit rate. Simulation yields a 7 % average hit rate increase over the Rotenberg fill mechanism.

40|$|Multiple-block {{prediction}} {{is emerging as}} a new and exciting research area. Highly accurate multiple-block predictors are essential for wide instruction fetch mechanisms, that will support future generations of microprocessors. The block-based trace cache is a recent proposal for wide instruction fetch. It aligns and stores instructions at the basic block level instead of at the trace level, thus significantly reducing instruction trace storage requirements. This paper investigates a new mechanism, the tree-based multiple-block predictor, that utilizes multiple-branch prediction techniques to improve trace construction in the <b>fill</b> <b>unit.</b> This new fill-time predictor, does not replace but augments the fetch time path-based next-trace predictor, by improving the trace construction heuristic.

40|$|Multiple {{issue of}} {{instructions}} occurs in superscalar and VLIW machines. This paper investigates a third type of machine design, which combines {{the advantages of}} code compatibility as in superscalars {{and the absence of}} complex dependency-checking logic from the decoder as in VLIW. In this design, a stream of scalar instructions is executed by the hardware and is simultaneously compacted into VLIW-type instructions, which are then stored in a structure called a shadow cache. When a shadow cache line contains the instructions requested by the fetch unit, the scalar instruction stream is preempted and all operations in the shadow cache line are simultaneously issued and executed. The mechanism that compacts instructions is called a <b>fill</b> <b>unit,</b> and was first proposed for dynamically compacting microoperations into large executable units by Melvin, Shebanow, and Patt in 1988.

An I-COP is highly versatile and can be used to implement different types of instruction transformations to enhance the IPC of the core processor. We study four potential applications of the I-COP to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept and investigate the design issues of such a coprocessor.
