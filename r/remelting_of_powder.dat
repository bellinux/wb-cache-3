40|$|The {{dismantling}} of cathode ray tubes (CRTs) represents a pressing environmental problem. CRTs consist of three distinguished glass parts. The front part is a barium-strontium glass, while the parts hidden inside the TV sets consist of lead silicate glasses. The high quality standards in manufacturing new CRTs impose {{a very limited}} amount of glasses to be recycled {{in the production of}} the original components. In addition, the presence of easily reducible oxides (like PbO) in the chemical composition of CRT glasses causes the risk of dispersing poisonous substances during <b>remelting.</b> Sintering <b>of</b> <b>powdered</b> glass could be a profitable way to produce new dense glass based materials without remelting. CRT glasses were found to be strongly susceptible to both the duration of the firing at the sintering temperature and the furnace atmosphere (oxygen, air, nitrogen). The evolution of the relatively large amount of dissolved oxygen, typical of CRT glasses, is found to contrast densification. Very short firing times (up to 15 min) are found to limit gas evolution. In addition, oxidative atmospheres lead to high quality sintered materials, capable of optical transparency comparable to that of pristine glasses...|$|R
40|$|Aim and Background: Scientific {{approach}} is the utilization of the new generative manufacturing process termed Selective Laser Melting (SLM) {{for the creation of}} biocompatible three-dimensional (3 -D) bone substitutes made of the titanium alloy TiAl 6 V 4. The SLM technique enables direct transfer of virtual 3 -D structures into solid metal materials with full serial characteristics and typically great freedom of geometric design. Material and Methods: Individual 3 -D CAD data which are derived from computed tomography models of anatomic structures are subdivided into layers of defined thickness. The actual part is generate by a repeating process of applying TiAl 6 V 4 <b>powder</b> in layers <b>of</b> 0. 003 - 0. 1 mm on the process chamber platform transferring the area and contour information of each layer into the material using a laser beam. The physical process is a complete <b>remelting</b> <b>of</b> the <b>powder</b> with a metallurgical bonding between the layers yielding densities of approximately 100 %. This operation is repeated step by step until the generation of the 3 -D part is completed. We cultured human primary osteoblast-like cells on different surfaces of SLM-manufactured TiAl 6 V 4 parts to prove osteoblast compatibility. Proliferation, vitality, and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity of osteoblast cultures are presented. Results: It has become possible to produce complex 3 -D geometries with different surface properties within few hours. Compatibility of the tested TiAl 6 V 4 material with human osteoblasts is demonstrated. The cultured cells attach and proliferate on SLM substrates and show AP activity. Conclusions: The presented results demonstrate the potential offered bythe SLM process. On the basis of scanned information, the generation of complex anatomic structures is realizable. The presented promising advantages make this procedure interesting for the production of individual implants or bone substitutes...|$|R

However, there are important differences. The density profile of the liquid in the Fe 3 S snow region is unstable. The sinking and <b>remelting</b> <b>of</b> Fe 3 S results in an increase in S with increasing depth, which results in turn in a decreasing density with depth. In the Fe 3 S snow region, therefore, the material continuously crystallizes and <b>remelts</b> because <b>of</b> this unstable situation. Below the snow zone, compositional convection is absent, since the <b>remelting</b> <b>of</b> Fe 3 S results in a local increase of S and leads to the formation of a lower density fluid layer on top of the denser liquid core below. This situation is stable. However, thermally driven convection in the bottom fluid layer may still be possible, since the heat flow from the lower core is adiabatic owing to the convective snow zone. Over time, the Fe 3 S snow region comprises the entire core and a solid inner Fe 3 S core forms. For this crystallization scenario, we can find two convection layers and, therefore, two dynamo regions if thermally driven convection is efficient in the liquid inner core. Alternatively, the dynamo region is located in the upper core, attains its maximum extent when the snow zone reaches the center, and then shrinks again owing to the growth of the solid inner core.|$|R

Despite constituting only 0. 5 % of the oceanic crust section drilled in IODP Site 735 B, they carry a significant budget of incompatible elements, which they redistribute within the crust. Such melts are saturated in accessory minerals, such as zircon, titanite and apatite, and often zircon is the only remaining phase that preserves magmatic composition and records processes of felsic melt formation and evolution.
