50|$|A screw {{conveyor}} is an Archimedes screw contained within a tube and turned by a motor {{so as to}} deliver material {{from one end of}} the conveyor to the other. It is particularly suitable for transport of granular materials such as plastic granules used in injection molding, and cereal grains. It may also be used to transport liquids. In industrial control applications the conveyor may be used as a <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> or variable rate feeder to deliver a measured rate or quantity of material into a process.|$|E
50|$|ARF is a {{variable}} speed <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> {{for bulk materials}} that works {{in harmony with the}} natural flow of the material being fed. The ARF, using a rotating member and articulable gate, controls the volume of material flow based on the material's inherent angle of repose. The speed of rotation and the positioning of the articulable gate provides a consistent feed of your material. Drum rotation allows the material to be gently fed without retarding material flow, while minimizing surge loading, product degradation, dust generation and maintaining uniformity of material flow.|$|E

50|$|Rotary feeders, {{also known}} as rotary {{airlocks}} or rotary valves, are commonly used in industrial and agricultural applications as a component in a bulk or specialty material handling system. Rotary feeders are primarily used for discharge of bulk solid material from hoppers/bins, receivers, and cyclones into a pressure or vacuum-driven pneumatic conveying system. Components of a <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> include a rotor shaft, housing, head plates, and packing seals and bearings.Rotors have large vanes cast or welded on and are typically driven by small internal combustion engines or electric motors.|$|E
50|$|Double dump valves, {{also known}} as double flap valves or double flap gates, are a type of airlock valve {{commonly}} used in industrial applications as a component in bulk material handling applications. Double dump valves are primarily used to discharge chunky or fibrous, bulk materials from hoppers, bins, and cyclones operating under positive or negative pressure. Double dump valves are used to discharge a flow of material {{while at the same}} time serving as an airlock transition point to preserve the pressure differential above and below the valve. This type of material handling valve is ideal for use with bulky or abrasive materials that would tend to jam or damage a <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder.</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} the effects of creep feeder design and feed accessibility on preweaning performance and the proportion of eaters of creep feed. Materials and methods: A total of 54 sows and their litters were assigned to three treatments: <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> with hopper, <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> without hopper, and pan feeder. A creep diet with 1. 0 % chromic oxide was offered ad libitum from Day 18 until weaning (Day 21). Fecal samples were collected from piglets with sterile swabs 3 to 12 hours before weaning. Piglets were categorized as “eaters” when either of the two fecal samples was colored green; otherwise, they were categorized as “non-eaters. ” Pigs were weighed Days 0 (birth), 18, and 21, and litter creep-feed disappearance was determined daily. Results: There were no differences (P >. 05) in preweaning gains and weaning weights of pigs and litters using the different types of creep feeder. Litters provided creep feed using the <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> with the hopper had 2. 7 times lower total creep-feed disappearance than litters using the <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> without the hopper and the pan feeder (P <. 001). However, the <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> with the hopper produced the highest proportion of pigs consuming creep feed within the litter (80 %; P <. 001). Implications: The proper choice of creep feeder is essential to manage creep feeding and to maximize the number of eaters in the litter. A creep feeder with a hopper may create more eaters with less feed wastage...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment {{was to determine the}} effects of different creep feeder designs and increased feed accessibility on creep feed consumption and pre-weaning performance. A total of 54 sows (PIC Line 1050) and their litters were used in this study. Two groups of sows were blocked according to parity and date of farrowing using a randomized complete block design and allotted to three experimental treatments: Treatment 1 – <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> with hopper (Control), Treatment 2 – <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> without hopper, and Treatment 3 – pan feeder. A creep diet (1, 585 kcal ME/lb, 1. 56 % TID Lys) with 1. 0 % chromium oxide was offered ad libitum at d 18 until weaning (d 21). A single lactation diet (1, 586 kcal ME/lb, 0. 97 % TID Lys) was used, where sows were allowed free access to feed throughout lactation. Piglets were weighed individually at d 0 (birth), 18, and 21 (weaning) to calculate total and daily gains. Litter creep feed intake as feed disappearance was also calculated. Fecal samples from all piglets were taken twice using sterile swabs between 3 and 12 h before weaning for all treatments. Piglets were categorized as ‘eaters’ when the fecal sample was colored green at least once on any of the two samplings. Results showed no differences in pig (P< 0. 18) and litter (P< 0. 51) weights at weaning among litters using the different types of creep feeder. Total and daily gains of pigs (P< 0. 20) and litters (P< 0. 31) were also similar across treatments. Litters using the <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> without the hopper or the pan feeder had 2. 7 times greater (P< 0. 0001) total creep disappearance than those using the <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> with the hopper. The average feeding frequency was 1, 2. 3, and 4. 2 times per 12 h for the <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> with and without the hopper, and the pan feeder, respectively. Creep feeder design influenced (P< 0. 0001) the proportion of eaters created among piglets provided with creep feed. There were 69, 47, and 42 % eaters in creep-fed litters using the <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> with a hopper, <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder</b> without hopper, and pan feeder, respectively.

40|$|In firing {{systems of}} cement {{production}} plants and coal-fired power plants, regular fossil fuels are increasingly substituted by alternative fuels. Rising energy prices and ambitious CO 2 -reduction goals promote {{the use of}} alternative fuels as {{a significant contribution to}} efficient energy recovery. One possibility to protect energy resources are refuse-derived fuels (RDF), which are produced during the treatment of municipal solid, commercial and industrial waste. The waste fractions suitable for RDF have a high calorific value and are often not suitable for material recycling. With current treatment processes, RDF still contains components which impede the utilization in firing systems or limit the degree of substitution. The content of these undesired components may amount to 4 wt%. These, in most cases incombustible particles which consist of mineral, ceramic and metallic materials can cause damages in the conveying systems (e. g. <b>rotary</b> <b>feeder)</b> or result in contaminations of the products (e. g. cement, chalk). Up-to-date separation processes (sieve machine, magnet separator or air classifier) have individual weaknesses that could hamper a secure separation of these particles. This article describes a new technology for the separation of impurities from refuse derived fuels based on a rotating fluidized bed. In this concept a rotating motion of the particle bed is obtained by the tangential injection of the fluidization gas in a static geometry. The RDF-particles experience a centrifugal force which fluidized the bed radially. The technical principle allows tearing up of particle clusters to single particles. Radially inwards the vertical velocity is much lower thus particles of every description can fall down there. For the subsequent separation of the particles by form and density an additionally cone shaped plate was installed in the centre. Impurities have a higher density and a compact form compared to combustible particles and can be separated with a high efficiency. The new technology was experimentally investigated and proven using model-RDF, actual-RDF and impurities of different densities. In addition, numerical simulations were also done. The fluidization chamber was operated in batch mode. The article describes experiences and difficulties in using rotating fluidized bed systems...|$|E

50|$|<b>Rotary</b> airlock <b>feeders</b> {{are very}} often {{installed}} to dose material in a pneumatic conveying line. As a consequence, {{a lot of}} gas coming from the conveying line is brought upstream by {{the rotation of the}} valve and the leakages in between the rotor and the stator.

40|$|The Morgantown Energy Technology Center (METC) is {{currently}} evaluating hot gas desulfurization (HGD) in its on-site transport reactor facility (TRF). This facility was originally {{constructed in the}} early 1980 s to explore advanced gasification processes with an entrained reactor, and has recently been modified to incorporate a transport riser reactor. The TRF supports Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power systems, one of METC`s advanced power generation systems. The HGD subsystem is a key developmental item in reducing the cost and increasing {{the efficiency of the}} IGCC concept. The TRF is a unique facility with high-temperature, high-pressure, and multiple reactant gas composition capability. The TRF can be configured for reacting a single flow pass of gas and solids using a variety of gases. The gas input system allows six different gas inputs to be mixed and heated before entering the reaction zones. Current configurations allow the use of air, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, methane, nitrogen, oxygen, steam, or any mixture of these gases. Construction plans include the addition of a coal gas input line. This line will bring hot coal gas from the existing Fluidized-Bed Gasifier (FBG) via the Modular Gas Cleanup Rig (MGCR) after filtering out particulates with ceramic candle filters. Solids can be fed either by a <b>rotary</b> pocket <b>feeder</b> or a screw feeder. Particle sizes may range from 70 to 150 micrometers. Both feeders have a hopper that can hold enough solid for fairly lengthy tests at the higher feed rates, thus eliminating the need for lockhopper transfers during operation...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryMichael D. TokachFive {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} {{determine the influence of}} creep feeding on individual consumption characteristics and growth performance of neonatal and weanling pigs. These evaluated the effects of lactation feed intake and creep feeding (n = 84 litters; Exp. 1), creep feeding duration (n = 54 litters; Exp. 2), creep feeder design and feed accessibility (n = 54 litters; Exp. 3), organoleptic properties of the creep feed (n = 50 litters; Exp. 4) and creep diet complexity (n = 96 litters; Exp. 5). In summary, creep feeding did not affect preweaning gains and weaning weights of pigs weaned at 3 weeks of age. Creep feeding for 18 d did not influence sow performance. However, creep feeding tended to improve litter weaning weights due to improved survivability. Creep feed consumption was related to piglet maturity rather than the induction of creep feeding. In both experimental and field conditions, pigs that consumed creep feed (eaters) had greater post-weaning feed intake and daily gains compared to non-eaters (pigs that did not consume creep feed) and non-creep fed pigs. This led to improvements in pig weight uniformity and reduction of the severity of post-weaning lag. These benefits were achieved regardless of weaning weight, the complexity of the creep diet, and the duration of creep feeding. The proportion of eaters of creep feed in whole litters can be manipulated. Longer duration of creep feeding increased the proportion of eaters. A <b>rotary</b> creep <b>feeder</b> with a hopper created the most eaters with the lowest creep feed disappearance. Creep diet complexity had the greatest effect in increasing the proportion of pigs consuming creep feed. On the other hand, low feed intake of lactating sows and adding feed flavors to the creep feed did not affect creep feed consumption and the proportion of pigs consuming creep feed. Therefore, creep feeding that focuses in encouraging more suckling piglets to eat is beneficial in producing weanling pigs that are better adapted to weaning, which improves post-weaning performance...|$|R
40|$|Powder flow {{appears in}} many {{industrial}} processes, including pharmaceuticals, food, detergents etc. Understanding the parameters affecting powder flow {{is necessary for}} rational product and process design. This research examines powder-air interactions for three powder handling systems: bin discharge, linear shoe-die system and <b>rotary</b> paddle <b>feeder.</b> As a starting point the flow behaviour of powders was characterised using established procedures to provide basic set of properties for assessing flowability. Powder permeability {{and the influence of}} small levels of compaction on permeability were determined. The influence of differential pressure on flow initiation from arching state was examined for powders discharging from bins. A dimensional model was developed to predict the differential pressure required to initiate powder flow as a function of orifice diameter and height of the powder above the exit. The mass flow rate of the powders were measured under a range of differential pressures. A dimensional model was developed to predict the mass flow rate as a function of differential pressure and exit diameter. The effect of processing parameters on the mass of the powder delivered into the die in linear shoe-die systems under the gravity and suction fill mechanism were investigated. The system was accommodated with differential pressure transducers and the evolution of the pressure inside during the process was monitored. Dimensional models were developed to predict the mass delivered into the die as a function of powder differential pressure developed during gravity and suction fill, shoe velocity and the velocity of the punch in the die. The influence of paddle rotational speed, exit diameter and differential pressure on the mass flow rate of powders in rotary feeding system was examined. This research identified the dimensionless groups relevant for the understanding of the flow of fine and cohesive powders under differential air pressure conditions. The dimensional models developed account for air pressure effects for 1) flow initiation and 2) flow rate during bin discharge, 3) gravity and 4) suction fill mechanisms in linear shoe-die filling systems. These models can be used to aid the design of powder flow processes where air pressure effects are influential...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 54 sows (PIC Line 1050) and their litters {{were used in}} this study to {{determine}} the effects of varying durations of creep feeding on the rate of pigs consuming creep feed (eaters) and pre-weaning performance. Two groups of sows were blocked according to parity and date of farrowing and allotted to three experimental treatments using a randomized complete block design. Creep feeding was initiated at d 7, 14, and 18 from birth for a duration of 13, 6, and 2 d of creep feeding. A creep diet (1, 585 kcal ME/lb, 1. 56 % TID Lys) with 1. 0 % chromium oxide was offered ad libitum until weaning (d 20) using a <b>rotary</b> creep <b>feeder</b> with hopper. A single lactation diet (1, 586 kcal ME/lb, 0. 97 % TID Lys) was used where sows were allowed free access to feed throughout lactation. Piglets were weighed individually at d 0 (birth), 7, 14, 18, and 20 to calculate total and daily gains. Daily creep feed intake per litter was recorded and calculated. Fecal samples from all piglets were taken twice per sampling day using sterile swabs at d 14, 18, and 20 for Treatment 1; at d 18 and 20 for Treatment 2; and d 20 for Treatment 3. Piglets were categorized as ‘eaters’ when fecal sample was colored green at least once on any of the sampling days. Overall, there were no differences in weaning weights (P< 0. 61), total gain (P< 0. 38), and daily gain (P< 0. 38) among pigs and litters fed creep for different durations. Total creep feed intake of litters fed creep for 13 and 6 d were greater (P< 0. 0001) than those litters provided creep feed for 2 d. There were no differences (P< 0. 69) in overall creep intake between litters fed for 13 and 6 d. Litters provided with creep feed for 13 d produced 10 % more (80 vs. 70 %; P< 0. 03) eaters than litters fed creep for both 6 and 2 d. There were no differences (P< 0. 98) in the percentage of eaters between litters fed creep for 6 and 2 d. In conclusion, longer durations of creep feeding did not affect pre-weaning gain and weaning weights but did increase the proportion of eaters in whole litters; however, a relatively high percentage of pigs (70 %) were classified as eaters by providing creep feed for only 2 d prior to weaning...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} program {{is concerned with}} {{the development of a new}} form of feeder, known as the Stamet Posimetric O High Pressure Solids Feeder, to feed dry granular solids continuously and controllably into gas pressure. The device is a <b>rotary</b> mechanical <b>feeder,</b> which utilizes the interlocking and internal friction of the granular solids to drive the solids through into the outlet pressure in a continuous and controllable way, using a continuous solids material seal on the feeder outlet to control gas leakage. Earlier work sponsored under previous SBIR grants has successfully demonstrated the potential benefits of the Stamet machine over pressurized lock hopper or paste feeder methods. The objective of this project was to demonstrate proof of principal to feed and meter specified granular coal into 450 psig gas pressure for use with next generation pressurized fluidized bed combustors. This report encompasses the development of material transport properties testers, methods to predict feeder performance by calculation, and the modification and testing of Stamet feeders to feed the material supplied into pressure. Testers were made to measure material compressibility, bulk density, both internal and wall friction coefficients, and permeability under typical conditions experienced inside a Stamet high pressure feeder. This data is then used in support of ongoing efforts to develop calculations to predict the performance of Stamet pressure feeders with different materials and conditions. Three Stamet pressure feeders were modified to handle the fine granular or pulverized coal, and were tested under various conditions using different outlet arrangements. The initial testing identified difficulties in handling the fine materials, but through a series of calculations and tests, the issues were overcome and the material was successfully fed into pressure. In all cases the performance calculated based on the measured material properties and feeder geometry agreed well with the test results, confirming the ability to predict performance and select geometry required to handle different conditions. However, the maximum pressure achieved was limited by an ineffective auger design, which was unable to effectively control the length of the outlet seal at higher pressures without imposing additional mechanical loads on the surface of the coal seal. This prevented steady state conditions being maintained long enough to reach the target pressure. Though the specified coal was successfully pumped into pressures over 200 psi, and the test results clearly indicate the changes required to provide a fixed outlet geometry that would achieve the 450 psi target, time and funding was not available to pursue this goal further under this project...|$|R
