[...] McConnell has received more money in donations from the [...] "Finance, Insurance and Real Estate" [...] sector than any other sector according to the Center for Responsive Politics. McConnell responded [...] "I'd say that that's inaccurate. You could talk to the community bankers in Kentucky." [...] The Democratic Party's plan for financial reform is actually a way to institute [...] "endless taxpayer funded bailouts for big Wall Street banks", said McConnell. He {{expressed concern that the}} proposed $50 billion, bank-funded fund that would be used to liquidate financial firms that could collapse [...] "would of course immediately signal to everyone that the government is ready to bail out large banks". In McConnell's home state of Kentucky, the Lexington Herald-Leader ran an editorial saying: [...] "We have read that the <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> plan for financial reform, but McConnell isn't talking up any solutions, just trashing the other side's ideas with no respect for the truth." [...] According to one tally, McConnell's largest donor from the period from January 1, 2009, to September 30, 2015, was Bob McNair, contributing $1,502,500.|$|E
