We also investigate how – if at all – explicit ranking of performance levels affects how employees respond to <b>relative</b> performance <b>information.</b> Our hypotheses are developed based on insights about social comparisons and status incentives from the psychology and behavioral economics literature. The results of the experiment show that the provision of <b>relative</b> performance <b>information</b> increases employee performance, yet we find no additional effects of rank ordering. Specifically, average performance levels are similar in conditions in which relative performance figures are presented in random order, in best-to-worst order and in worst-to-best order...|$|R
40|$|This paper proposes {{distributed}} discrete-time algorithms to cooperatively solve an additive cost {{optimization problem}} in multi-agent networks. The striking feature {{lies in the}} use of only the sign of <b>relative</b> state <b>information</b> between neighbors, which substantially differentiates our algorithms from others in the existing literature. We first interpret the proposed algorithms in terms of the penalty method in optimization theory and then perform non-asymptotic analysis to study convergence for static network graphs. Compared with the celebrated distributed subgradient algorithms, which however use the exact <b>relative</b> state <b>information,</b> the convergence speed is essentially not affected by the loss of information. We also study how introducing noise into the <b>relative</b> state <b>information</b> and randomly activated graphs affect the performance of our algorithms. Finally, we validate the theoretical results on a class of distributed quantile regression problems...|$|R

50|$|It is {{physically}} impossible to correctly simulate large scale ego-motion in the limited {{space of a}} laboratory. The standard approach to simulate motions (so called motion cueing) is to simulate the “relevant” cues as closely as possible, especially the acceleration of an observer. Visual and auditory cues enable humans to perceive their location in space on an absolute scale. On the other hand, the somatosensory cues, mainly proprioception and the signals from the vestibular system, code only <b>relative</b> <b>information.</b> But fortunately (for our purpose), humans cannot perceive accelerations and velocities perfectly and without systematic errors.

40|$|In this paper, {{formation}} {{tracking control}} problems for second-order multi-agent systems (MASs) with time-varying delays are studied, specifically those where {{the position and}} velocity of followers are designed to form a time-varying formation while tracking those of the leader. A neighboring <b>relative</b> state <b>information</b> based formation tracking protocol with an unknown gain matrix and time-varying delays is presented. The formation tracking problems are then transformed into asymptotically stable problems. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, conditions sufficient for second-order MASs with time-varying delays to realize formation tracking are examined. An approach to obtain the unknown gain matrix is given and, since neighboring <b>relative</b> velocity <b>information</b> is difficult to measure in practical applications, a formation tracking protocol with time-varying delays using only neighboring <b>relative</b> position <b>information</b> is introduced. The proposed results can be used on target enclosing problems for MASs with second-order dynamics and time-varying delays. An application for target enclosing by multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is given to demonstrate the feasibility of theoretical results...|$|R

Subjects in one study were asked whether [...] "Paul" [...] or [...] "Susan" [...] was more likely to be assertive, given no other information than their first names. They rated Paul as more assertive, apparently basing their judgment on a gender stereotype. Another group, told that Paul's and Susan's mothers each commute to work in a bank, did not show this stereotype effect; they rated Paul and Susan as equally assertive. The explanation is that the additional information about Paul and Susan made them less representative of men or women in general, and so the subjects' expectations about men and women had a weaker effect. This means unrelated and non-diagnostic information about certain issue can make <b>relative</b> <b>information</b> less powerful to the issue when people understand the phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} known {{term used}} for maps in Japan {{is believed to}} be kata (形, roughly form), which was probably in use until roughly the 8th century. During the Nara period, the term zu(図) came into use, but the term most widely used and associated with maps in pre-modern Japan is ezu (絵図, roughly “picture diagram”). As the term implies, ezu were not necessarily geographically accurate depictions of physical landscape, as is generally associated with maps in modern times, but pictorial images, often including spiritual landscape in addition to physical geography. Ezu often focused on the conveyance of <b>relative</b> <b>information</b> as opposed to adherence to visible contour. For example, an ezu of a temple may include surrounding scenery and clouds to give an impression of nature, human figures to give a sense of how the depicted space is used, and a scale in which more important buildings may appear bigger than less important ones, regardless of actual physical size.|$|E

40|$|<b>Relative</b> {{direction}} <b>information</b> is very commonly used. Observers typically {{describe their}} environment by specifying the relative directions {{in which they}} see other objects or other people {{from their point of}} view. Or they receive navigation instructions with respect to their point of view, for example, turn left at the next intersection. However, it is surprisingly hard to integrate <b>relative</b> direction <b>information</b> obtained from different observers, and to reconstruct a model of the environment or the locations of the observers based on this information. Despite intensive research, there is currently no algorithm that can effectively integrate this information: this problem is NP-hard, but not known to be in NP, even if we only use left and right relations. In this paper we present a novel qualitative representation, StarVars, that can solve these problems. It is an extension of the STAR calculus [Renz and Mitra, 2004]) by a VARiable interpretation of the orientation of observers. We show that reasoning in StarVars is in NP and present the first algorithm that allows us to effectively integrate <b>relative</b> direction <b>information</b> from different observers. ...|$|R

Accuracy “is a description of systematic errors” while precision “is a description of random errors”. In the classical model statistical accuracy is measured as the p-value or probability with which one would falsely reject the hypotheses that an expert’s probability assessments were statistically accurate. A low value (near zero) means it is very unlikely that the discrepancy between an expert’s probability statements and observed outcomes should arise by chance. Informativeness is measured as Shannon <b>relative</b> <b>information</b> (or Kullback Leibler divergence) with respect to an analyst-supplied background measure. Shannon <b>relative</b> <b>information</b> is used because it is scale invariant, tail insensitive, slow, and familiar. Parenthetically, measures with physical dimensions, such as the standard deviation, or the width of prediction intervals, raise serious problems, as a change of units (meters to kilometers) would affect some variables but not others. The product of statistical accuracy and informativeness for each expert is their combined score. With an optimal choice of a statistical accuracy threshold beneath which experts are unweighted, the combined score is a long run “strictly proper scoring rule”: an expert achieves his long run maximal expected score by and only by stating his true beliefs. The classical model derives Performance Weighted (PW) combinations. These are compared with Equally Weighted (EW) combinations, and recently with Harmonically Weighted (HW) combinations, as well as with individual expert assessments.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the design of}} distributed state and output feedback control algorithms for linear multi-agent systems with performance guarantees {{in the presence of}} delays. The multi-agent systems considered are assumed to exchange <b>relative</b> <b>information</b> over an information network. As a first contribution, a novel distributed state feedback control design method with a sub-optimal LQR performance is developed for a network of multiple agents. For the control design process, it is assumed that the exchange of <b>relative</b> <b>information</b> is instantaneous. A stability analysis of the proposed control law is performed by incorporating delays in <b>relative</b> <b>information</b> to ascertain the maximum possible delay that can be accommodated by the communication network. Subsequently, the assumption of the exchange of instantaneous <b>relative</b> <b>information</b> in the control design process is relaxed and the <b>relative</b> <b>information</b> is assumed to be delayed. The system is then represented as a time-delay system. Distributed state feedback control synthesis methods are then developed for the system with a certain level of LQR performance. In the above contributions, the time delay analysis and the development of delay based control methods, it is implicitly assumed that delays are detrimental to achieving cooperative tasks for a multi-agent system. Subsequently, positive effects of delays in communication of <b>relative</b> <b>information</b> are explored. For this a network of vehicles described by double integrator dynamics, which cannot be stabilized by static output feedback without delays, is considered. A novel control design method to achieve exponential stabilization of such a multi-agent system by static output feedback using delayed <b>relative</b> <b>information</b> is developed. Conclusions are drawn from the results of the research presented in this thesis and a few directions for future work are identified...|$|E
