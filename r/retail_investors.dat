40|$|Given {{restrictions}} {{placed on}} communication with prospective <b>investors,</b> <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> attention can help firms/underwriters {{with the task}} of initially valuing an IPO. Using Google search volume to proxy for <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> attention, we find that the presence of and an increase in retail attention following initial filing but prior to initial pricing are positively related to initial valuations. Our results are robust to alternative matching methods to identify our matched sample of non-IPO firms and to including several controls for institutional demand. We conclude that <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> attention plays a critical role {{in the early stages of}} IPO valuation...|$|R
40|$|We {{dispel the}} belief that the January effect, {{anomalous}} returns to small-capitalization stocks in the month of January, is a <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> trading phenomenon. We use a market with a July-June tax year, Australia, to separate potential tax loss selling from other anomalous returns. Our results indicate that a January effect does persist in the Australian market, {{but it is not a}} result of <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> trading. Furthermore, <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> trading does not have a convincingly significant effect independent of market capitalization. Our study is important as a direct test of the assumption that retail trading causes market anomalies...|$|R
25|$|Controversy also arose {{around the}} fact that <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> were {{excluded}} from the initial public offering (IPO) due to Qinetiq's complexity and that institutional investors would require less complicated marketing and financing. This led to contrasts with the 'Sid' campaign for British Gas plc in 1986, where <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> were encouraged to buy shares, with discounts and a large advertising campaign. The issue was partially resolved by allowing some brokerage firms to place orders in the IPO as part of a combined order, allowing the firm to purchase as though an institutional investor but on behalf of clients. While this did not result in a public campaign or retail investor discounts, it did allow many investors to purchase shares. The company floated on 10 February 2006, with an IPO of 200p per share, which gave a market value of £1.3bn. On 13 February 2006 (the Monday after the Friday IPO) shares closed at 219.5p, valuing the company at over £1.4bn.|$|E
25|$|In general, the NAV {{will stay}} close to $1, but is {{expected}} to fluctuate above and below, and will break the buck more often. Different managers place different emphases on risk versus return in enhanced cash – some consider preservation of principal as paramount, and thus take few risks, while others see these as more bond-like, {{and an opportunity to}} increase yield without necessarily preserving principal. These are typically available only to institutional investors, not <b>retail</b> <b>investors.</b>|$|E
25|$|Given {{the huge}} {{quantity}} of gold stored above ground {{compared to the}} annual production, {{the price of gold}} is mainly affected by changes in sentiment, which affects market supply and demand equally, rather than on changes in annual production. According to the World Gold Council, annual mine production of gold {{over the last few years}} has been close to 2,500 tonnes. About 2,000 tonnes goes into jewelry or industrial/dental production, and around 500 tonnes goes to <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> and exchange-traded gold funds.|$|E

25|$|Canada {{also has}} a fairly unusual form of venture capital {{generation}} in its Labour Sponsored Venture Capital Corporations (LSVCC). These funds, also known as Retail Venture Capital or Labour Sponsored Investment Funds (LSIF), are generally sponsored by labor unions and offer tax breaks from government to encourage <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> to purchase the funds. Generally, these Retail Venture Capital funds only invest in companies {{where the majority of}} employees are in Canada.

Taiwan, despite reporting few losses from the subprime mortgage crisis, was said to have Lehman-related exposure for its companies and <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> totaling $2.5 billion. To increase purchasing power, the ROC government has issued the ROC consumer voucher.|$|E
25|$|When Ricketts {{finished}} undergraduate studies (1988), {{he joined}} the Chicago Board Options Exchange as a market maker. Ricketts held this position until 1994, shortly after finishing his MBA. From 1995 to 1996, he served as vice president with Mesirow Financial until moving to ABN AMRO as vice president in their brokerage division. Ricketts is credited with pioneering {{the idea of using}} the Internet and other technologies to help companies sell their investment-grade bonds directly to <b>retail</b> <b>investors,</b> as opposed to limiting sales only to institutions. He helped launch the first successful version of this system while at ABN AMRO. In 1999 he left ABN AMRO to found Incapital.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{presumption}} is that {{a broker}} executing a stock trade for a <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> will get the investor the best possible price execution for the transaction. In fact, the broker often sells the <b>retail</b> <b>investor’s</b> trade to an intermediary for a cash payment. The broker’s motivation to generate dealer profits seems to overcome the broker’s fiduciary responsibility to obtain the best execution price for the customer, raising ethical questions. Purchasers and internalizers of order flow in the market may cause prices quoted on the NYSE to deteriorate, making all investors worse off...|$|R

25|$|To many <b>retail</b> <b>investors,</b> {{money market}} funds are confusingly similar to {{traditional}} bank demand deposits. Virtually all large {{money market funds}} offer check writing, ACH transfers, wiring of funds, associated debit and credit cards, detailed monthly statements of all cash transactions, copies of canceled checks, etc. This makes it appear that cash is actually in the individual’s account. With net asset values reported flat at $1.00, despite the market value variance of the actual underlying assets, an impression of rock solid stability is maintained. To help maintain this impression, money market fund managers frequently forgo being reimbursed legitimate fund expenses, or cut their management fee, on an ad hoc and informal basis, to maintain that solid appearance of stability.|$|E
25|$|Foreign {{exchange}} trading increased by 20% between April 2007 and April 2010, {{and has more}} than doubled since 2004. The increase in turnover is due to a number of factors: the growing importance of foreign exchange as an asset class, the increased trading activity of high-frequency traders, and the emergence of <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> as an important market segment. The growth of electronic execution and the diverse selection of execution venues has lowered transaction costs, increased market liquidity, and attracted greater participation from many customer types. In particular, electronic trading via online portals has made it easier for retail traders to trade in the foreign exchange market. By 2010, retail trading was estimated to account for up to 10% of spot turnover, or $150 billion per day (see below: Retail foreign exchange traders).|$|E
25|$|When a {{security}} is sold, the seller is contractually obliged {{to deliver it}} to the buyer. If a seller sells {{a security}} short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation. Otherwise, the seller fails to deliver, the transaction does not settle, and the seller {{may be subject to}} a claim from its counterparty. Certain large holders of securities, such as a custodian or investment management firm, often lend out these securities to gain extra income, a process known as securities lending. The lender receives a fee for this service. Similarly, <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> can sometimes make an extra fee when their broker wants to borrow their securities. This is only possible when the investor has full title of the security, so it cannot be used as collateral for margin buying.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, OCBC {{sold its}} 29.9% {{stake in the}} group to Indonesia's Lippo Group (under Auric Pacific Singapore) for S$203 million as they could not own more than 5% in {{non-core}} assets. In October 2006, there was a controversial board meeting, with new owner Lippo booting out long serving chairman Michael Wong Pakshong. Another board member, Chew Gek Khim, who narrowly retained her seat in the board, resigned on 30 October 2006, after serving the board for 18 years. Chew {{was the chairman of}} its remuneration and nominating committees of the corporation. She is the granddaughter of the late Tan Sri Dr. Tan Chin Tuan, the latter invested in the company when he was at OCBC. Days later, the two remaining independent directors resigned from the company's board. They are Cham Tao Soon and Winston Tan. Stephen Riady told the media that he was interviewing candidates for new independent directors back in September. Stephen has been a board director of the company since Auric Pacific acquired the company. The fallout at the AGM has questioned several <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> questioning the manner of how OCBC sold its stake in April 2006.|$|E
500|$|Although Morgan Stanley was {{the more}} {{prominent}} partner, Dean Witter's focus on <b>retail</b> <b>investors,</b> mutual funds and credit cards which were seen by the stock market as generating more stable cash flows than Morgan Stanley's investment banking business, had {{by the time of}} the merger made it the more valuable partner in terms of market capitalization. [...] Dean Witter's CEO, Philip Purcell, the main architect of the merger, became chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the merged group. [...] The merger marked the pairing of a storied investment banking firm with a retail brokerage (that had been owned by a retailer) that was often termed [...] "white shoes and white socks". [...] In order to avoid tension during the integration of the two firms, Purcell and Morgan Stanley's CEO John Mack decided not to choose between the two brand names. Instead, they combined the names of the two firms and put the Morgan Stanley Dean Witter brand on almost all of its operations.|$|E
2500|$|SEC is {{specifically}} authorized to issue [...] "point-of-sale disclosure" [...] rules when <b>retail</b> <b>investors</b> purchase investment products or services; these disclosures include concise information on costs, risks, and conflicts of interest. This authorization follows up the SEC's failure to implement proposed point-of-sale disclosure rules in 2004 and 2005; These proposed rules generated opposition {{because they were}} perceived as burdensome to broker-dealers. For example, they would require oral disclosures for telephone transactions, were not satisfied by cheap internet or email disclosures, and could allow the customer to request disclosures specific {{to the amount of}} their investment. In determining the disclosure rules, the Act authorizes the SEC to do [...] "investor testing" [...] and rely on experts to study financial literacy among <b>retail</b> <b>investors.</b>|$|E
40|$|This essay {{argues that}} the 2004 Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, the {{investment}} services cornerstone of the Financial Services Action Plan, represents a bold attempt to build a pan-EU <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> culture, relying on the transformative effects of law. While the institutional markets have attracted most attention under the FSAP, this strategy represents a sharp change in EU policy, is ambitious {{given the state of}} the retail markets and provokes important questions as to the role of law in generating retail activity {{and the role of the}} <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> in developing effective and strong EU capital markets. This essay examines how MIFID attempts to build a retail investment culture through law, the market reality behind this policy shift, what the role of law is in this process and what the emerging retail regime suggests as to the characteristics of the emerging ‘EU retail investor’ as a target of regulatory policy and engine of retail market integration. The newly adopted MIFID conduct of business regime lies at the heart of this ambitious retail agenda and is used as a case study in this analysis. The risks and costs of this approach are, however, high given the unproven relationship between law and investor activity, whether domestic or pan-EU. The essay therefore considers whether this new regulatory and policy strategy on the <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> is sufficiently nuanced and, in particular, whether, given the risks of imposing inappropriate rules on an immature marketplace, it is matched by appropriate <b>retail</b> <b>investor</b> governance...|$|R
