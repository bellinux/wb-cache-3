50|$|The RBL BDPT {{holds an}} annual retreat that {{consists}} of three components. The first is a keynote lecture by a distinguished member of the bone community. The second is a competition for three $45,000 one-year Lawrence Awards, made possibly by generous support from Rolanette and Berdon Lawrence. A short <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> submitted by applicants (junior faculty or individuals from outside the bone field who develop a research idea focused on bone). These applications are reviewed and scored by the Directors {{and members of the}} program advisory committee with the goal of narrowing the field to 6 applicants.

40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} of this <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> to see how components {{can be used to}} map information from one system to an other. To do this a number of different problems must be addressed, and three groups of problems can be found. The first is how components work and how the other problems can benefit from that. The second is mapping, both syntactically and semantically. What information is needed and how {{is it going to be}} used in the components? Lastly, processes need to be found and modelled, that is what activities are actually done in the system and how do they work together? All the problems need to be address iteratively since they depend on each other. The result of this <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> the preliminary problem statement “How can components be used and constructed to be able to map information from one system to another while retaining the semantic value of the information?”. This is going to be explored in two projects, the first one using an in-house produced reference database as a prototype. The second project will use the knowledge gathered from the first and apply it to a real-world system. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> <b>is</b> an {{optimality}} theory for multirate systems with regards to their capability of decomposing a class of stochastic signals into multirate components. Several notions of optimum decomposition are proposed and it is shown that they all call for an ideal system known as a Principal Component Filter Bank. Issues involving approximating this system using realizable structures that possess a nite number of parameters are investigated. Open problems and topics to be explored are then discussed...|$|E
40|$|PhD <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> <b>are</b> {{critical}} to the success of an application to a PhD programme of study.

There is no minimum or maximum word count for a <b>proposal</b> but it <b>is</b> expected that the <b>proposal</b> would <b>be</b> at least 2000 words. A proposal should include content around the following headings...|$|R
