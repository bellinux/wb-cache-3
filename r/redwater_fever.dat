5000|$|Babesia bovis is a {{single-celled}} parasite {{of cattle}} which occasionally infects humans. It {{is a member}} of the phylum Apicomplexa, which also includes the malaria parasite. The disease it and other members of the genus Babesia cause is a hemolytic anemia known as babesiosis and colloquially called Texas cattle <b>fever,</b> <b>redwater</b> or piroplasmosis. It is transmitted by bites from infected larval ticks of the order Ixodida. [...] It was eradicated from the United States by 1943, but is still present in Mexico and much of the world's tropics. The chief vector of Babesia species is the southern cattle fever tick Rhipicephalus microplus (formerly Boophilus microplus).|$|R
50|$|Babesiosis is a malaria-like {{parasitic}} disease caused by infection with Babesia, a genus of Apicomplexa. Human babesiosis is an uncommon but emerging {{disease in the}} Northeastern and Midwestern United States and parts of Europe, and sporadic {{throughout the rest of}} the world. It occurs in warm weather. Ticks transmit the human strain of babesiosis, so it often presents with other tick-borne illnesses such as Lyme disease. After trypanosomes, Babesia is thought to be the second-most common blood parasite of mammals, and they can have a major impact on health of domestic animals in areas without severe winters. In cattle, a major host, the disease is known as Texas cattle <b>fever,</b> <b>redwater,</b> or piroplasmosis.|$|R
5000|$|The {{means of}} combating tick-fever caused by cattle-tick {{resulted}} from research by Charles Joseph Pound who began investigating [...] "redwater disease of cattle" [...] in the gulf district in 1894. He established that <b>redwater</b> or tick <b>fever</b> was confined to bovines and that the disease was readily transmissible by ticks and identified the genus of tick vector Boophilus. In the mid-1890s, Pound, as Queensland Government Bacteriologist, undertook tick fever inoculation studies. These, the first such trials in Australia, established a methodology and dosage that is still used worldwide. A cattle dip was built at the former Indooroopilly Sheep Quarantine Grounds in 1898 and until 1905 {{was used by the}} Department of Agriculture to establish a suitable dipping preparation and procedure for the destruction of cattle ticks.|$|R
50|$|By {{the age of}} 22 Stanley was {{the largest}} native trader in Eastern Mashonaland. He was a great traveller, opening up trade routes right across Africa, notably in Mozambique and Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) where he used his ox carts to supply the trading posts of the Great White Hunters. He {{explored}} the centre part of Mozambique for the Portuguese, returning only to find his business ruined through the new cattle disease East Coast fever, then known as African Coast fever. An outbreak of Rinderpest in the 1890s had previously killed 80 to 90 percent of all cattle in Southern Africa. Cecil Rhodes had now imported 1000 new cattle from Australia, which were landed at Beira in Mozambique and were allowed to mix with the local cattle, exposing them to this new disease. East Coast Fever broke {{out as soon as}} Rhodes's herd reached Umtali and rapidly infected numbers of local cattle, ultimately spreading throughout the whole country. (It wasn't until 1902 that it was determined that this new disease was spread by ticks from the imported cattle). The Rhodesian Chartered Company's government was bombarded with requests and petitions to destroy any and every other beast that came into contact with the dead cattle, to stamp out the plague at the start, but the government claimed it was just a bad outbreak of <b>redwater</b> <b>fever</b> that would soon subside.|$|E
5000|$|Babesia bovis {{protozoa}} {{are transmitted}} by R. microplus and cause babesiosis or <b>redwater</b> <b>fever</b> in cattle throughout the tropics and subtropics wherever this boophilid species occurs. The less pathogenic Ba. bigemina is transmitted by R. microplus and R. decoloratorus. Development of Babesia in the tick {{is complex and}} includes sexual reproduction. These Babesia are transmitted from adult female boophilid ticks to the next generation, as larvae, by infection of the eggs. This is known as transovarian transmission; it provides the only opportunity for transmission through one-host ticks. Other species of Babesia are transmitted by three-host ticks in ways similar to Theileria protozoa, as described below. In cattle, infection of the red blood cells may grow rapidly to create a potentially fatal inflammatory crisis of the blood. The name redwater (coloured urine) derives from the hemoglobinuria caused by the destruction of red blood cells infected with the merozoite stage of Babesia; anemia results from the same destruction. Horses suffer babesiosis or biliary fever when infected by Ba. equi or B. caballi. This occurs in many countries where vector ticks are found, such as R. e. evertsi, Hy. truncatum, and D. nitens. Dogs are at risk from severe infection with Ba. canis and its subspecies, transmitted by the dog ticks R. sanguineus, D. reticulatus, and Ha. leachi. Domestic cats become infected with Ba. felis and Ba. cati from feeding ticks. Cytauxzoon felis is a protozoan related to Babesia and Theileria. It is transmitted by the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis. This microbe circulates between wild bobcats in southern USA, causing little apparent disease. If it infects domestic cats, it causes a cytauxzoonosis that is eventually fatal. 11Theileria annulata is a protozoan closely related to Babesia. In cattle, it causes the disease tropical theileriosis throughout a long arc of countries from Morocco across to China. [...] Theileria parva is the causative microbe of East Coast fever of cattle in Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa. Theileria species infect monocytic white blood cells of their hosts. The infected cells are induced to divide by the Theileria, which then proliferates within each daughter cell, in a rapidly expanding infection. This causes multiple inflammatory crises, of which pulmonary edema is a predominant cause of death. Theileria annulata is transmitted by Hy. a. anatolicum, Hy. detritum, and other hyalommas. Theileria parva is transmitted predominantly by Rhipicephalus appendiculatus. Because this is a three-host feeding tick, the opportunities for transmission are from infected cow to feeding larva then through the molt into the nymph which feeds and transmits. Similarly, also, transmission can be from feeding nymphs to infected adult. This is known as transstadial transmission, and no transovarian transmission occurs in this case. The development of Theileria in ticks includes sexual reproduction which enables generation of new variants that can evade the immune mechanisms of cattle.|$|E
40|$|Tick-borne {{diseases}} are every cattle owner s nightmare. With <b>redwater</b> <b>fever,</b> heartwater, anaplasmosis and East Coast fever rampant, {{there is no}} (sub) tropical area {{in the world that}} is spared from these deadly tick-borne diseases. Various control measures have been successful in fighting them. Dipping cattle at regular intervals in chemical acaricides (the insecticide for dealing with ticks) has eradicated East Coast fever in much of southern Africa. But this method is labour intensive and the acaricides are costly. In addition, only those ticks on the dipped cattle get killed. There are alternative hosts galore and any breakdown in the dipping control programmes can lead to a disease outbreak. Acaricides also pose a risk to human health and the environment. Their use is no longer encouraged, and when they are used, they should be changed at least every 2 years. Scientists have also argued against total eradication of ticks, in order to allow animals to develop some resistance. It was only in the 1990 s that science developed ethnopractices to control ticks in Africa. Researchers from the University of Nairobi collected a variety of control measures, such as: home-made acaricides consisting of a boiled mix of pepper, tobacco leaves and soap; hand removal of ticks during milking; keeping chickens (tick predators) with livestock; and applying zero-grazing or grazing only between 10 am and 3 pm, when tick activity is lowest. The Livestock Health Research Institute (LHRI) in Tororo, Uganda is working with Stylosanthes species (stylo grass) and Gynandropsis gynandra (spider flower); both have tick-repelling properties in pastures. The latter is also eaten as a vegetable in rural eastern Africa. The sticky hairs on its stems prevent ticks from climbing to the top and hitching a lift with grazing cattle. Other plants, including Commiphora erythraea, C. myrrh and C. holtziana, contain essential oils with tick-repelling properties. The LHRI stresses that these are just a random sample from a field that urgently needs exploring to find more viable and affordable tick control measures.
