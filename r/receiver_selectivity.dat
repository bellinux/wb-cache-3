5000|$|The {{bandwidth}} {{characteristics of}} a resonant antenna element can be characterized according to its Q, just as one uses to characterize the sharpness of an L-C resonant circuit. A common mistake is to assume {{that there is an}} advantage in an antenna having a high Q (the so-called [...] "quality factor"). In the context of electronic circuitry a low Q generally signifies greater loss (due to unwanted resistance) in a resonant L-C circuit, and poorer <b>receiver</b> <b>selectivity.</b> However this understanding does not apply to resonant antennas where the resistance involved is the radiation resistance, a desired quantity which removes energy from the resonant element in order to radiate it (the purpose of an antenna, after all!). The Q of an L-C-R circuit is defined as the ratio of the inductor's (or capacitor's) reactance to the resistance, so for a certain radiation resistance (the radiation resistance at resonance does not vary greatly with diameter) the greater reactance off-resonance causes the poorer bandwidth of an antenna employing a very thin conductor. The Q of such a narrowband antenna can be as high as 15. On the other hand, the reactance at the same off-resonant frequency of one using thick elements is much less, consequently resulting in a Q as low as 5. These two antennas may perform equivalently at the resonant frequency, but the second antenna will perform over a bandwidth 3 times as wide as the antenna consisting of a thin conductor.|$|E
30|$|The NTF zeros {{are usually}} {{placed on the}} desired signal band(s) to create the noise-shaping effect. At the same time, the STF zeros {{can be used to}} {{attenuate}} out-of-band frequencies and thus include some of the <b>receiver</b> <b>selectivity</b> in the QΣΔM. The transfer function design for CR is discussed in more detail in Section 4. In the following subsections, multi-band and multistage principles will be presented. These are important concepts, considering reconfigurability in the A/D interface and frequency agile conversion with high-enough resolution in CR devices.|$|E
50|$|The {{frequencies}} {{are very}} close to those of WWV, and WWVH. Because of this, RWM is very difficult to receive in North America with simple <b>receivers</b> of low <b>selectivity,</b> due to interference from these said stations.|$|R
50|$|Crystal-controlled {{superheterodyne}} <b>receivers</b> {{with better}} <b>selectivity</b> and stability made control equipment more capable and at lower cost. Multi-channel developments were of particular use to aircraft, which really needed {{a minimum of}} three control dimensions (yaw, pitch and motor speed), as opposed to boats, which required only two or one.|$|R
50|$|The {{superheterodyne}} receiver has several advantages over previous receiver designs. One advantage is easier tuning; only the RF and LO are tuned by the operator; the fixed-frequency IF is tuned ("aligned") {{at the factory}} and is not adjusted. In older designs such as the tuned radio frequency receiver (TRF), all of the receiver stages had to be simultaneously tuned. In addition, since the IF filters are fixed-tuned, the <b>receiver's</b> <b>selectivity</b> is the same across the receiver's entire frequency band. Another advantage is that the IF signal can be {{at a much lower}} frequency than the incoming radio signal, and that allows each stage of the IF amplifier to provide more gain. To first order, an amplifying device has a fixed gain-bandwidth product. If the device has a gain-bandwidth product of 60 MHz, then it can provide a voltage gain of 3 at an RF of 20 MHz or a voltage gain of 30 at an IF of 2 MHz. At a lower IF, it would take fewer gain devices to achieve the same gain. The regenerative radio receiver obtained more gain out of one gain device by using positive feedback, but it required careful adjustment by the operator; that adjustment also changed the selectivity of the regenerative receiver. The superheterodyne provides a large, stable, gain and constant selectivity without troublesome adjustment.|$|R

40|$|Background: Research {{indicates}} {{expert and}} novice teachers communicate differently during instruction. However, these differences {{have yet to be}} investigated in relation to student learning. <b>Receiver</b> <b>selectivity</b> theory offers an interpretive framework for understanding how expert-novice communication differences might function to discriminate student learning when it is defined as the student’s ability to recall the most important information the teacher intended to communicate. Purpose: This study examined {{expert and novice}} golf instructors’ communication and student learning using <b>receiver</b> <b>selectivity</b> as a theoretical framework. Specifically, student recall was investigated in relation to the teachers’ communication behaviors and the perceived outcomes of these behaviors. Participants and setting: Stage theory guided the selection of four expert and four novice female golf instructors (n ¼ 8). Eight students, who were male and female and varied in age (19 – 26) and skill level, were also recruited for participation. This study was conducted at two golf course driving ranges in Orlando, Florida and by telephone from the researcher’s university. Study design: This study employed a qualitative research design to provide a descriptive account of expert and novice golf instructors’ communication {{from the perspective of the}} teachers’ students, identify perceived outcomes of teacher communication, and examine student recall. <b>Receiver</b> <b>selectivity</b> theory guided data collection and interpretation of the results. Research techniques were drawn from seminal sourcebooks on semi-structured interviews and data management/reduction. Data collection: Students were assigned to take an individual lesson on the full swing with either an expert or a novice teacher. Following their lessons, the teachers were asked to identify the target information they had intended to communicate to their students. Two weeks later, students were asked by telephone to identify the most important information from their lessons, to describe their teachers’ communication behaviors, and to discuss the perceived outcomes of their teachers’ communication. Data analysis: Teacher and student perceptions of target information were compared to determine if students recalled what teachers had intended to communicate in their lessons. Inductive analysis was used to find patterns of expert and novice communication behaviors. Student interviews were searched for statements about perceived outcomes of teacher communication. Findings: Seven of the eight students recalled the target information their teachers had intended to communicate. Themes in the teachers’ communication behaviors revealed expert-novice differences but perceived outcomes of teacher communication were positive – and in some cases, the same – for both groups. Conclusions: Positioned against <b>receiver</b> <b>selectivity</b> theory, the findings indicate both expert and novice teachers successfully engaged students in the learning process. Teacher behaviors (both expert and novice) and their perceived outcomes support previous research highlighting strategies for increasing student learning. Distinctive elements of this study, including nonverbal behaviors that were featured and the one student to one teacher ratio, are important considerations for explaining divergent findings between this study and those of previous research comparing the expositive discourse of expert and novice classroom teachers...|$|E
30|$|Until now, simplistic CP-OFDM signal {{models have}} been used as the PU and CR signal models for {{spectrum}} allocation algorithms [23 – 26, 29 – 32]. Except for [27, 28], CP-OFDM has also been used for the CR. The primary knowledge we assume about the PU waveform is its transmitted power spectral density (PSD) and the <b>receiver</b> <b>selectivity</b> mask; otherwise, there are no limitations regarding the PU signal model. In our case study, we select the PU waveform either as CP-OFDM following the 802.11 -g standard or an FBMC waveform with similar parameterization. Furthermore, a nonlinear transmitter power amplifier model (the so-called Rapp model [33]) is used for the PU system in order to obtain a realistic model for the PU spectrum. To the best of our knowledge, this aspect has not been considered in earlier work. In this way, we are able to quantify the effects of the PU spectral characteristics on the SU capacity. It is seen that the nonlinear power amplifier-induced spectral leakage (regrowth) effect, which is present in any radio communication system, has {{a significant impact on the}} SU capacity. As for the SU waveform, we have chosen the FBMC scheme for the case study because it has the sharpest spectrum, reaching the maximum spectral containment among the alternatives. However, generic multicarrier model is included in the overall system model, and the analysis and optimization methods are readily applicable for any multicarrier waveform for the CR.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} we show the Channel coding plays a very {{important}} role in OFDM systems performance. The structure of OFDM systems makes channel coding more effective in confronting fading channels. Sometimes Coded OFDM is known as COFDM.

The signal at the unwanted frequency was called the compensation-wave. In arc transmitters up to 70 kW, the key typically shorted out a few turns in the antenna coil. For larger arcs, the arc output would be transformer coupled to the antenna inductor, and the key would short out a few bottom turns of the grounded secondary.

40|$|Sound {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the life history of mosquitoes. Male mosquitoes detect females by the sound generated by their wingbeat. Because female wings are weak acoustic radiators, males have been driven by sexual selection to evolve sensitive acoustic sensors. Mosquito antennae are very sensitive acoustic receivers, featuring up to 16, 000 sensory cells, a number comparable with that contained in the human cochlea. The antennal sound <b>receiver</b> exhibits frequency <b>selectivity,</b> input amplification, and self-generated oscillations, features that parallel the functional sophistication of the cochlear amplifier. Although arguably the male antenna is well suited to receiving weak female sounds, the role of active mechanisms in mosquito hearing is far from understood. Previous mechanical studies on mosquito hearing largely focused on the steady-state antennal response to harmonic sounds, mostly evaluating the data through conventional Fourier transforms. Here, we report on the time-resolved mechanical behavior of the male antenna in response to female sounds. Crucially, stimuli were designed to reflect the temporal acoustic profile of a female flying by. With these stimuli, several previously unreported nonlinear features were unveiled, involving amplification, compression, and hysteresis. The time-resolved analysis reveals that, through the active participation of the sensory neurons, the antenna mechanically responds to enlarge its own range of detection. This behavior augments the capacity of the antennal receiver to detect female sounds, enhancing the male's chance to successfully pursue a passing female...|$|R
40|$|Just say {{in public}} that {{oscillators}} {{are one of}} the most important, fundamental building blocks in radio technology and you will immediately be interrupted by someone pointing out that tuned-RF (TRF) receivers can be built without any form of oscillator at all. This is certainly true, but it shows how some things can be taken for granted. What use is any receiver without signals to receive? All intentionally transmitted signals trace back to some sort of signal generator—an oscillator or frequency synthesizer. In contrast with the TRF receivers just mentioned, a modern, all-mode, feature-laden MF/HF transceiver may contain in excess of a dozen RF oscillators and synthesizers, while a simple QRP CW transmitter may consist of nothing more than a single oscillator. (This chapter was written by David Stockton, GM 4 ZNX. Frederick J. Telewski, WA 7 TZY, also contributed to the Frequency Synthesizers section.) In the 1980 s, the main area of progress in the performance of radio equipment was the recognition of receiver intermodulation as a major limit to our ability to communicate, with the consequent development of receiver front ends with improved ability to handle large signals. So successful was this campaign that other areas of transceiver performance now require similar attention. One indication of this is any equipment review receiver dynamic range measurement qualified by a phrase like “limited by oscillator phase noise. ” A plot of a <b>receiver’s</b> effective <b>selectivity</b> can provide another indication of work to be done: An IF filter’s high-attenuation region may appear to be wider than the filter’s published specifications would suggest— almost as if the filter characteristic has grown sidebands! In fact, in a way, it has: This is the result of local-oscillator (LO) or synthesizer phase noise spoiling the receiver’s overall performance. Oscillator noise is the prime candidate for the next major assault on radio performance. The sheer number of different oscillator circuits can be intimidating, but their great diversity is an illusion that evaporates once their underlying pattern is seen. Almost all RF oscillators share one fundamental principle of operation: an amplifier and a filter operate in a loop (Fig 10. 1).

Thesis (Master's) [...] Bilkent University, 2011. Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 52 - 55. In {{this thesis}} we designed and implemented an underwater acoustic (UWA) communication system employing multicarrier modulation {{in the form}} of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). UWA communication became more popular as there has been a growing interest in transmitting real-time data, such as video and sonar images. There are many applications where these transmissions are used. These applications are underwater wireless sensor networks(UWSN) and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) for military and scientific purposes. Therefore, building an efficient UWA communication system which has a high data rate can improve these applications’ performance signifi- cantly. Currently, many underwater communication systems use single carrier modulation which have limited data rate due to complexity of their <b>receivers,</b> as frequency <b>selectivity</b> of the channel increases when the symbol rate increases, so we preferred to use multicarrier modulation in UWA communication in order to increase data rate of our system. In this thesis, we considered a system that uses zero-padded (ZP) OFDM modulation. Based on ZP-OFDM, we used a receiver model that performs pilot-tone based channel estimation, carrier frequency offset compensation based on least squares (LS) fitting error or null subcarriers if they occur and data demodulation for each OFDM block individually. We used MATLAB environment for implementing our system. The MATLAB scripts generate a data burst that contains OFDM blocks, and then it is transmitted to the hardware from a laptop by using a Data Acquisition (DAQ) Card. At {{the other side of the}} system, the receiver laptop gets the data by using a DAQ Card. As the data is received, MATLAB scripts are used for demodulating it. As we built our system, we performed underwater experiments at Bilkent Lake Facility to investigate its performance in a real UWA channel. In our test, a data rate of 13. 92 kbps has been achieved with quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation while the bit-error-rate (BER) was less then 9 x 10 − 2 without using any coding.

40|$|The {{receiver}} is {{the backbone}} of modern communication devices. The primary purpose of a reliable receiver is to recover the desired signal from {{a wide spectrum of}} transmitted sources. A general radio receiver usually consists of two parts, the radio frequency (RF) front-end and the demodulator. RF front-end receiver is roughly defined as the entire segment until the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) placed before digital demodulation. Theoretically, a radio receiver must be able to accommodate several tradeoffs such as spectral efficiency, low noise figure (NF), low power consumption, and high power gain. The superheterodyne receiver consisting of double downconversion can well balance the tradeoffs required for the receiver design. In this thesis, the RF front-end superheterodyne receiver design and implementation is presented. Instead of fixed radio frequency of system-on-chip (SOC) design which has been a popular research topic, a radio receiver operating in the wide frequency range of roughly 2. 53 GHz to 2. 83 GHz located in IEEE S-band is considered. The wide frequency range receiver is suitable for applications like Direct-to-Home satellite television systems, which allocates from 2. 5 GHz to 2. 7 GHz. This thesis is focusing on the off-chip receiver design for the objectives of processing a wider frequency band while providing high linearity and power gain. The important active devices in a receiver which are low noise amplifiers (LNA), power amplifiers (PA), and mixers are designed and implemented. In this work, the two-stage LNA designed provides low NF and good input standing wave ratio (VSWR). The class-A PA is designed utilizing the load-pull method for maximum power transfer and highest possible power added efficiency (PAE). The mixer design adopts the double balance fully differentially (Gilbert) topology which is ideal for low port feedthrough, intermodulation distortion, and moderate conversion gain. The self-built active devices (e. g. amplifiers and mixers) and band-pass filters (BPF) provided by Agilent EEsof Advance System Design (ADS) are combined into a double downconversion RF front-end receiver. The <b>receiver</b> sensitivity and <b>selectivity</b> is assessed and tabulated. Also, the operation in the wide frequency range of roughly 2. 53 GHz to 2. 83 GHz with the last intermediate frequency (IF) of 20 MHz is verified...|$|R
40|$|An optical {{wireless}} transmission technique represents an attractive choice for many indoor and outdoors applications within fixed and mobile networks. It {{has the advantage}} of providing a wide bandwidth that is unregulated worldwide, with availability to use it in a very dense fashion, and potentially very low cost. Due to the high attenuation suffered by Infrared radiation through the air, operating low power transmission sources, and generally adverse signal to the noise environment found by ambient background light, where the optical signal is typically at it is minimum power level when detected. A high sensitivity and high <b>selectivity</b> <b>receiver</b> will be imperative for such applications as subcarrier multiplex systems, millimetre-wave radio over fibre and other wireless optical system applications. The thesis details the research, design, and optimisation of a novel, low-noise frontend optical receiver concept using a photoparametric amplifier (PPA) technique, in which the detected optical baseband signal is electrically amplified and up-converted to upperside frequency, based on the nonlinear characteristic of the pin photodiode junction; the desired signal passes through a further signal processing stage, and the original baseband signal is recovered again, using the concept of the superheterodyne principle. The designed DCHPPA receiver acts in a parallel manner to a conventional double superheterodyne detector system, but without the noise penalty normally incurred in the first stage. The PPA is used instead of a resistive/transistor based mixer at the first stage. DCHPPAs have the properties to provide very high gain, with high selectivity, combined with a very low noise operation. The research is conducted from three aspects: theoretical analysis, modelling and simulation, and practical implementation and result analysis. The three approaches followed the same trend shown, and the results correspond closely with each other. Theoretically, a new non-degenerate PPA mode of operation is discussed, in which the applied dc bias to the pin photodetector is replaced by the applied ac pump signal. This is shown to be advantageous in terms of the desirable characteristics for PPA operation, leading to improved conversion efficiency and the potential for low noise operation. PPA was shown to behave more optimally with load resistance which was much lower than normally used in the common optical wireless receiver-amplifiers. A new PPA gain theory was derived and optimised accordance with the original gain theory, PPA input/output admittance power was analysed for optimum power transfer. More accurate DCHPPA circuit configurations were modelled and simulated using nonlinear simulator tools (AWR) which help to understand and optimise system performance, particularly device parameters and characteristics. The full DCHPPA system was implemented practically, and tested in VHF and UHF as a sequel to the simulation configuration, which subsequently exhibited a 34. 9 dB baseband signal over the modulated optical signal; by employing a chain gain DCHPPA cascaded configuration, 56. 3 dB baseband signal gain was achieved. The PPA noise was also measured and analysed, which satisfied the tough front-end optical system requirements...|$|R
40|$|The {{increase}} of the consumer electronics market {{the last couple of}} decades {{has been one of the}} main drivers of IC process technology development. The majority of the ICs are used in digital applications, and for these CMOS is the choice of technology. The urge to squeeze more transistors on to a given area has led to shrinking feature sizes. It has resulted in higher transition frequencies and reduced supply voltage. During the last decade the increasing transition frequency has enabled CMOS to be used in RF applications, as well. Unfortunately, the decreasing supply voltage that, until recently, has accompanied the reduced feature sizes makes it more difficult to build power amplifiers that can deliver the amount of power needed to transmit the radio signal over the desired distance. In the receiver, the reduced supply voltage has resulted in reduced signal swing, which compromises linearity and dynamic range. In this thesis new topologies for the power amplifier is investigated, and the approach to combine the power from multiple power amplifiers is taken. In this way, despite the low supply voltage, the transmitted power by the IC can still be high. The increased transition frequency of CMOS technology can be used to increase the operating frequency to tens of GHz. The possibility for small sized phased antenna arrays then reveals, giving high directivity of the antenna and the potential for electrical beam steering. This both reduces interference to nearby <b>receivers</b> through spatial <b>selectivity,</b> and increases the equivalent isotropic radiated power. Power amplifiers with digital 360 ◦ phase control and antenna arrays have been investigated. In recent years applications at high operating frequencies have attained much focus from both academia and industry, such as automotive radar at 77 GHz andWLAN at 60 GHz. Even though the shrinking feature sizes of CMOS transistors have resulted in transit frequencies above 150 GHz, the high frequency required by many applications is still a great challenge for the CMOS designer. Therefore, in Paper IV and Paper VI different approaches to keep the on chip frequency lower than the RF carrier frequency as long as possible have been taken. In Paper IV two different frequency doubling 60 GHz power amplifier topologies are presented, and in Paper VI a subharmonic mixer with 30 GHz radio frequency and 15 GHz differential local oscillator is presented. Many transceiver architectures rely on quadrature signals driving the down- or upconversion mixers. The power amplifiers in Paper I and II need quadrature signals to implement the digital phase control. Therefore, in Paper V a three-stage active polyphase filter with quadrature output signals, high operation frequency, and wide bandwidth is analyzed. Analytical equations for both voltage gain and phase transfer function of a loaded stage are derived. The filter shows robustness against process parameter spread and achieves high quadrature signal quality from 6 GHz to 14 GHz...|$|R
