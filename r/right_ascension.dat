25|$|However, all {{the early}} constellations were never universally adopted, whose popular usage {{was based on}} the culture or {{individual}} nations. Defining each constellation and their assigned stars also significantly differed in size and shape, whose arbitrary boundaries often lead to confusion to where celestial objects were to be placed. Before the constellation boundaries were defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1930, they appeared as simply encircled areas of sky. Today they now follow officially accepted designated lines of <b>Right</b> <b>Ascension</b> and Declination based on those defined by Benjamin Gould in Epoch 1875.0 in his star catalogue known as Uranometria Argentina.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, the {{boundaries}} between the 88 constellations were devised by Eugène Delporte along vertical and horizontal lines of <b>right</b> <b>ascension</b> and declination.

Gould first made his proposal to designate boundaries for the celestial sphere, a suggestion upon which Delporte would base his work.

This effect will increase over the years and centuries to come.|$|E

25|$|Hipparchus {{made his}} {{measurements}} with an armillary sphere, and obtained {{the positions of}} at least 850 stars. It is disputed which coordinate system(s) he used. Ptolemy's catalog in the Almagest, which is derived from Hipparchus's catalog, is given in ecliptic coordinates. However Delambre in his Histoire de l'Astronomie Ancienne (1817) concluded that Hipparchus knew and used the equatorial coordinate system, a conclusion challenged by Otto Neugebauer in his A History of Ancient Mathematical Astronomy (1975). Hipparchus seems to have used a mix of ecliptic coordinates and equatorial coordinates: in his commentary on Eudoxos he provides stars' polar distance (equivalent to the declination in the equatorial system), <b>right</b> <b>ascension</b> (equatorial), longitude (ecliptical), polar longitude (hybrid), but not celestial latitude.|$|E
25|$|Astronomers {{have been}} unable to observe Sgr A* in the optical {{spectrum}} because of the effect of 25 magnitudes of extinction by dust and gas between the source and Earth. Several teams of researchers have attempted to image Sagittarius A* in the radio spectrum using very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). The current highest-resolution measurement, made at a wavelength of 1.3 mm, indicated an angular diameter for the source of 37 μas. At a distance of 26,000 light-years, this yields a diameter of 44 million kilometers. For comparison, Earth is 150 million kilometers from the Sun, and Mercury is 46 million kilometers from the Sun at perihelion. The proper motion of Sgr A* is approximately −2.70mas per year for the <b>right</b> <b>ascension</b> and −5.6mas per year for the declination.|$|E
25|$|As {{the stars}} of Alpha Centauri {{approach}} the Solar System, the measured proper motion and trigonometric parallax slowly increase. Changes are also observed {{in the size of}} the semi-major axis of the orbital ellipse, increasing by 0.03arcsec per century. This small effect is gradually decreasing until the star system is at its closest to Earth, and is then reversed as the distance increases again. Consequently, the observed position angles of the stars are subject to changes in the orbital elements over time, as first determined by W. H. van den Bos in 1926.=μα×sinα×(t−to), where; α= <b>right</b> <b>ascension</b> (in degrees), μα is the common proper motion (cpm.) expressed in degrees, and θ and θo are the current position angle and calculated position angle at the different epochs.
