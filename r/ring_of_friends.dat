It had sought to build a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> that were {{supposed}} to become prosperous and more democratic, and to filter migrants coming to Europe.

40|$|The European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) – the EU’s {{initiative}} to launch deeper {{relations between the}} European Union and its neighbourhood both {{in the political and}} economic fields – was developed in the context of 2004 EU enlargement which aimed at materialising Brussels’ aspirations for deeper integration with the surrounding states, the immediate backyard of the EU. Through the ENP the EU has struggled to preserve the attractiveness of the European model for neighbouring states by using various mechanism of cooperation, however without offering them a full-fledged membership perspective. The ENP was intended to become a tool for shaping a stable environment for the European integration processes, guaranteeing security and stability, supporting democracy and the rule of law. In such way, the ENP was meant to establish a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> <b>friends</b> on the European Union borders...|$|E

2500|$|King David I {{is still}} widely {{regarded}} as one of the most significant rulers in Scotland's history. The reason is what Barrow and Lynch both call the [...] "Davidian Revolution". David's [...] "revolution" [...] is held to underpin the development of later medieval Scotland, whereby the changes that he inaugurated grew into most of the central non-native institutions of the later medieval kingdom. Barrow summarizes the many and varied goals of David I, all of which began and ended with his determination [...] "to surround his fortified royal residence and its mercantile and ecclesiastical satellites with a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> close <b>friends</b> and supporters, bound to him and his heirs by feudal obligation and capable of rendering him military service of the most up-to-date kind and filling administrative offices at the highest level".|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} these notes is to study <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> rank n: Definition 1 A <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> rank n is a commutative, {{associative}} ring with identity that is free of rank n as a Z-module. That is, a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> rank n is a ring (commutative, associative, with unit) whose underlying additive group is isomorphic to Z n. The prototypical examples <b>of</b> <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> rank n are, of course, orders in degree n number fields. The class of all such examples consists precisely <b>of</b> those <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> rank n that are integral domains. However, there are many interesting examples <b>of</b> <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> rank n that are not integral domains. For example, there are degenerate rings such as Z[x]/(x n) or Z[x 1, [...] .,xn− 1]/(x 1, [...] .,xn− 1) 2. One may also construct <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> rank n by taking (any rank n subring of) a direct sum <b>of</b> k <b>rings</b> having ranks n 1, [...] .,nk respectively, where n 1 + · · · + nk = n. For instance, Z ⊕n is a nice example <b>of</b> a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> rank n. More generally, we may consider <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> rank n over any base ring T: a <b>ring</b> <b>of</b> rank n over T is any ring that is locally free of rank n as a T-module. Concerning terminology, we refer to <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> rank 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 as quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic, or sextic rings respectively. In these notes, we wish to classify <b>rings</b> <b>of</b> small rank n, where by “small ” we mean “at most 5 ”. 1 We begin with the simplest possible case, namely n = 1. ...|$|R
