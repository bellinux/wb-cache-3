This work was done in the city of Puerto Carreño, with members of the educational institution Normal Superior School Federico Lleras Acosta, seventh grade. There observation of attitudinal changes presented in the participating students, compared to some categories of biodiversity values, before and after the application of the material was performed. Attempts were also significant to learning and awareness processes, in terms of ownership by the living and the natural, by the scope of the text. The text invites the adoption of a systemic view, through critical reflection, with context examples in the area. Analysis data were collected and triangulated using mixed methods research and design of research instruments. This information was used to <b>re</b> <b>adjust</b> the guide and finally validate, finding that in the region are welcomed and needed innovative ways in teaching biology. A different trend was then proposed in the teaching–learning phenomena of life, through thematic contextualized to the region, allowing subjects to recognize the complexity of life, appropriating their role in the conservation of the same and highlight the importance of wealth in bio-diverse and multicultural terms in Colombia...|$|E

A good short circuit current density was observed together with open circuit voltages up to 850 mV. However, the fill factor was close, but typically not exceeding, 70 [2]. The dark jV curve shows a distinct two diode behavior which was not previously observed in CuIn Ga S 2 based cells. It is conceivable that this contributes to the non optimum fill factor. Furthermore, {{results suggest that the}} photocurrent is voltage dependent, i. e. non optimum transport of the photocurrent. Process control of the buffer layer preparation suggests different absorber surface properties, compared to the Ga free reference, and the need to <b>re</b> <b>adjust</b> cell preparation parameters in order to fully exploit the efficiency potential of the absorber layers. This implies that the interface plays a significant role for photocurrent transport. In this contribution, in addition to the straightforward approach of quantifying the effects of CdS deposition parameters, the problem is addressed using device modeling and careful surface and interface analyses. Cu In,Ga S 2 surfaces are analyzed using near edge X ray absorption fine structure NEXAFS for the conduction band edge CBE and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy UPS for the valence band edge VBE. The correlation between absorber structure, buffer layer properties and cell performance is discussed. [1] S. Merdes, R. Kaigawa, J. Klaer, R. Klenk, R. Mainz, A. Meeder, N. Papathanasiou, D.

40|$|The dynamic {{nature and}} {{heterogeneity}} of modern execution environments such as mobile, ubiquitous, and grid computing, present major {{challenges for the}} development and efficient execution of the applications targeted for these environments. In particular, applications tailored to run in a specific environment will show different and most likely sub-optimal behaviour when executed on a different and/or dynamic environment. Consequently, there has been growing interests {{in the area of}} application adaptation which aims to enable applications to cope with the varying execution environments. Adaptive application partitioning, a specific form of non-functional adaptation involving distribution of mobile objects across multiple host machines, is of particular interest to this thesis due to the diversity of its uses. In this approach, certain runtime information (known as context) is used to allow an object-oriented application to adaptively (<b>re)</b> <b>adjust</b> the placement of its objects during its execution, for purposes such as improving application performance and reliability as well as balancing resource utilisation across machines. Promoting the adoption of such adaptation requires a process that requires minimal human involvement in both the execution and the development of the relevant application. These challenges establish the main goals and contributions of this work, which include: 1) Proposing an effective application partitioning solution via the adoption of a decentralised adaptation strategy known as local adaptation. 2) Enabling adaptive application partitioning which does not require human intervention, through automatic collection of required information/context. 3) Proposing a solution for transparently injecting the required adaptation functionality into regular object-oriented applications allowing significant reduction of the associated development cost/effort. The proposed solutions have been implemented in a Java-based adaptation framework called MobJeX. This implementation, which was used as a test bed for the empirical experiments undertaken in this study, can be used to facilitate future research relevant to this particular study...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the power of VO 2 max, peak {{treadmill}} running velocity (PTV), and running economy (RE), unadjusted or allometrically adjusted, in predicting 10 km running performance. Eighteen male endurance runners performed: 1) an incremental test to exhaustion to determine VO 2 max and PTV; 2) a constant submaximal run at 12 km·h− 1 on an outdoor track for RE determination; and 3) a 10 km running race. Unadjusted (VO 2 max, PTV and <b>RE)</b> and <b>adjusted</b> variables (VO 2 max 0. 72, PTV 0. 72 and RE 0. 60) were investigated through independent multiple regression models to predict 10 km running race time.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{examined}} {{the impact of a}} workplace-based stress management pro-gram on blood pressure (BP), emotional health, and workplace-related measures in hyperten-sive employees of a global information technology company. Design: Thirty-eight (38) employees with hypertension were randomly assigned to a treatment group that received the stress-reduction intervention or a waiting control group that received no intervention during the study period. The treatment group participated in a 16 -hour program, which included instruction in positive emotion refocusing and emotional restructuring techniques intended to reduce sympathetic nervous system arousal, stress, and negative affect, increase pos-itive affect, and improve performance. Learning and practice of the techniques was enhanced by heart rate variability feedback, which helped participants learn to self-generate physiological co-herence, a beneficial physiologic mode associated with increased heart rhythm coherence, physi-ologic entrainment, parasympathetic activity, and vascular resonance.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} the {{progress}} made in Cu In,Ga S 2 based solar cells prepared from sputtered metals subsequently sulfurized using {{rapid thermal processing}} in sulfur vapor. In a previous paper, we showed that Cu In,Ga S 2 solar cells with efficiencies of 12. 2 could be achieved. The current collection of the obtained cells as confirmed by the external quantum efficiency was excellent. However the used process resulted in absorbers with very expressed CuInS 2 CuGaS 2 top bottom segregation [1]. The electronic properties, including fill factor and open circuit voltage, were thus inferior to those obtained in our earlier work with multi source evaporated absorbers, where we could show that the best performance is obtained {{when there is a}} gallium content of about five percent in {{the upper part of the}} absorber layer [2]. In the current contribution, we show that the required degree of interdiffusion can be achieved by choosing appropriate sulfurization temperature profiles. Incomplete sulfurization is avoided and the process stability and reproducibility of cell properties is greatly enhanced. The corresponding material and cell properties are similar to multi source evaporation and a new record cell is obtained. The process leads to an effective band gap between those of the gallium free reference and the most efficient multi source evaporated cells. It was possible to increase the effective band gap resulting in open circuit voltages up to 842 mV. The structure and electronic properties of absorbers grown by different approaches and cells prepared from them has been analyzed. We will discuss the correlation between structure, gallium depth profile and cell performance. Voltage and quantum efficiency in relation to the effective band gap are compared to those of the multi source evaporated cells. Process control of the buffer layer preparation suggests different absorber surface properties and the need to <b>re</b> <b>adjust</b> heterojunction preparation in order to fully exploit the efficiency potential of our sequentially prepared Cu In,Ga S 2 absorber layer...|$|E

40|$|Although non-state armed {{groups are}} primary {{stakeholders}} in contemporary political conflicts, {{there has been}} little research into their members’ perspectives on internal factors shaping radicalisation and de-radicalisation. State and international actors often assume that bringing rebel leaders to the negotiating table or “converting” them to peaceful politicians means weakening, splitting, or dismantling militant structures. This paper re-evaluates those assumptions in the light of rebel leaders’ own accounts of internal organisational dynamics before, during, and after political conflicts and peace settlements. Participatory action research with “insider experts” from armed movements in Northern Ireland, Kosovo, Nepal, Aceh, El Salvador, Colombia, and South Africa reveals insiders’ analysis of leadership and organisational dynamics during armed conflict and political talks and highlights the rational decision-making process whereby proactive leaders constantly (<b>re)</b> assess and <b>adjust</b> their tactics (from unarmed to armed and vice versa) as the strategic environment evolves. Horizontal and vertical communication between members is critical for enabling collective ownership of transformation processes from violent insurgency to peaceful transition and preventing internal splits and disaffection during peace negotiations. The claim that rebel organisations should be dismantled as quickly as possible during peace processes is found to be dubious, highlighting instead the importance of retaining cohesive coordination and communication structures during volatile post-war transitions...|$|R

As some important patient profile differences may be unobserved, we use fixed effects (FE) regression to estimate the relationship between operative mortality and surgeon and hospital volumes, and compare this method with the more commonly used random effects (RE) regression approach. The 1998 and 1999 Medicare Inpatient and Denominator files for Medicare Fee for Service enrollees aged 65 – 99. Operative mortality rates are estimated for different surgeon and hospital volume tertiles (high, medium, low) using FE and <b>RE</b> regression methods, <b>adjusted</b> for patient demographics and morbidities.

FE regression estimates that lowest volume tertile hospitals have 1. 4 and lowest volume tertile surgeons have 1. 6 additional operative deaths (for every 100 CABG surgeries) compared to their highest volume tertile counterparts. The corresponding RE estimates are 0. 5 and 1. 4 respectively. The substantially higher FE hospital volume effect compared to RE indicates the presence of unobserved “protective” characteristics in lower volume providers, including a less complicated patient profile.

40|$|FLASH {{has been}} a user {{facility}} since 2005, delivering radiation in the wavelength range between 7 and 47 nm using the SASE principle. After the present upgrade, the wavelength range is extended to 4. 45 nm. With the third harmonic accelerating module in place to linearize the longitudinal phase space, the stability and reproducibility of the machine is substantially improved. The user requests for beam time by far exceeds the time available. In order to increase user beam time and to improve the radiation properties delivered to users, a major extension of the user facility called FLASH II has been proposed by DESY {{in collaboration with the}} HZB. FLASH II is a seeded FEL in the parameter range of FLASH. As logical continuation, the seeding with HHG which started with sFLASH will result in direct seeding. Because in the foreseeable future there will probably not be HHG seed lasers available at high repetition rates down to wavelengths of 4 nm, a cascaded HGHG scheme is proposed to produce short wavelengths.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{transnational}} family life of Polish migrants in Finland {{in the context}} of the changing political regime of the Polish nation?state after World War II. It looks at the fundamental practices through which kinfolks have strived to stay together despite separation, family connections and ruptures emerging across borders. The analysis is carried out with regard to three historical periods: the era of communist regime in Poland, the post- 1989 transformation and the period after Poland joined the European Union in 2004. The research results are based on an ethnographic study I conducted in 2006 - 2007 across Southern Finland among the Polish migrants who have in various family configurations moved to Finland since the 1960 s. The ethnography encompassed interviews and participant observation. The rituals of communication and visits were among the most important means of staying in contact. Their regular enactment ensured a sense of stability and security of family ties, but the development of new ICT technologies also facilitated their role as a means of control and surveillance. Being separated by national borders did not mean a stop to practical, emotional and material family support and care. They were (<b>re)</b> negotiated and <b>adjusted</b> to the transnational context, changing political circumstances and family dynamics. Both emotional labour and the provisioning of economic support were pursued by family members "here" and "there" with an awareness of the specificity of the transnational separation, and especially the time after 1989 necessitated a subtle navigation between a need for individualism and family collectivity. One of the crucial family relationships across the borders which the migrants in this research had was with their parents. The intergenerational transnational support was particularly salient at two stages of family life: the upbringing of the migrants? dependent children and the end of the elderly parents' life. How the final moments of the parents' life would unfold, and whether the migrants would be able to ensure the parents' "good death" was of great significance for the cumulative evaluation of their filial/parental relationship. The study showed that a transnational family is a dynamic and changeable formation, and that neither family duties nor family borders are clearly given and fixed. A family in a transnational space is rather a product of everyday and mundane efforts and of careful balancing of emotional and economic power.
