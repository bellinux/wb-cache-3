40|$|This {{investigation}} {{evaluated the}} effect of different surface treatment of the tooth <b>ridge</b> <b>lap</b> surface {{on the strength of}} the tooth/denture base interfacial bonding. The surface treatment regimens investigated were: microblasting, coating with a solventbased adhesive and a combined microblasting and adhesive coating of the <b>ridge</b> <b>lap</b> surface. All tests were conducted according to the ADA specification No. 15. The data were analyzed statistically using the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Scheffe test. A value of p < 0. 01 was considered significant. Roughening the tooth <b>ridge</b> <b>lap</b> surface by microblasting resulted in significantly stronger bonding to denture base than untreated <b>ridge</b> <b>lap</b> surface (p = 0. 001). Adhesive-coating the <b>ridge</b> <b>lap</b> surface did not promote bonding significantly compared with the untreated tooth surface (p = 0. 500). The combination treatment did improve bonding (p = 0. 007) but was significantly less compared with roughening the <b>ridge</b> <b>lap</b> only. Of the three evaluated surface treatment regimens, microblasting the tooth <b>ridge</b> <b>lap</b> surface seemed to have a major and significant contribution to establishing a satisfactory interfacial bonding...|$|E
40|$|A {{modified}} {{design for}} ovate pontics is proposed {{to achieve the}} esthetic, functional, and hygienic requirements for fixed partial dentures. This design should aid the clinician in preparing the edentulous area, thus resulting in less discomfort for the patient because little to no ridge augmentation is required. The same emergence profile can be developed as with the classic ovate pontic design. CLIhrICAL SIGNIFICANCE A modified ovate pontic has the following advantages: excellent esthetics because it produces a correct emergence profile;: fulfilled functional requirements; greater ease of cleaning {{as compared with the}} ovate pontic; an effective air seal, which eliminates air or saliva leakage; the appearance of a free gingiv~l margin and interdental papilla; elimination or minimization of the "black triangle " between the teeth; and little or no ridge augmentation required prior to the final restoration. (J Esthet Restor Dent 16 : 273 - 283, 2004) P ontic design is important to determine prior to fixed partial denture reconstruction; the type of pontic influences the surgical procedure if the edentulous area has a ridge defect. Four basic pontic designs have been used over the years: sanitary (hygienic), <b>ridge</b> <b>lap</b> (full <b>ridge</b> <b>lap,</b> total <b>ridge</b> <b>lap)</b> (Figure lA), modi-fied <b>ridge</b> <b>lap</b> (Figure lB), and ovate (Figure 1 C).

40|$|Introduction: With {{introducing}} composite teeth, their {{wear resistance}} {{has been well}} investigated, but there are few papers about their bonding to acrylic denture base resins. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the four pre-bonding preparation methods on the <b>ridge</b> <b>lap</b> surface of one multilithic denture tooth by determining its bond strength to denture base resin. Materials and Methods: In this experimental laboratory study, 84 maxillary anterior teeth were divided into four groups based on four different pre-bonding methods (untreated, grinding, 2 retention grooves and diatorics). The teeth were mounted on 2 sides of triangular shaped wax models. Then, the laboratory procedures (wax elimination and resin packing) were done. Each of the specimens was tested by universal testing machine with cross head speed of 5 mm/min. The data were analyzed by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann- Whitney tests. Results: The mean bond strength in untreated group was 287. 38 ± 51. 82 N, in grinding group was 301. 52 ± 113. 65 N, in retention grooves group was 374. 38 ± 88. 22 N and in diatorics group was 415. 19 ± 226. 37 N. The highest mean bond strength was seen in diatorics group (P= 0. 009). The percentage of cohesive fractures in this group(90. 5 %) was significantly more than that in other groups (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Purpose: To test {{in vitro}} the shear bond {{strength}} of resin teeth to an acrylic resin denture base given different ridge-lap surface treatments. Materials and Methods: Ninety rectangular dies {{were made with}} wax and traditionally invested in metallic or plastic flasks.

40|$|In today's busy world, most {{patients}} {{do not have}} time for long, drawn-out dental treatment. The time span between extraction and healing after loss of tooth in the anterior esthetic zone can be esthetically and psychologically devastating {{on the part of}} the patient. Especially, when a maxillary anterior tooth must be extracted and replaced, immediate tooth replacement with an ovate pontic on a provisional bridge is a good alternative. Ovate pontic helps in preservation of the interdental papilla, which in turn preserves the natural gingival contour that would have otherwise been lost after extraction. An immediate tooth replacement using ovate pontic not only eliminates the psychologically disturbing partially edentulous phase but also results in a much more esthetically pleasing replacement of tooth that is both hygienic and natural in appearance. Another added advantage of the use of ovate pontic is that it rules out the dissatisfaction resulting from an unesthetic <b>ridge</b> <b>lap</b> pontic placed directly over edentulous ridge. Just like the long-lived bird “Phoenix,” arising out of its own ashes, the ovate pontic creates an illusion that the pontic is emerging from the gingiva, even after tooth loss.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the bond {{strength}} between acrylic denture base and teeth subjected to 6 surface treatments. Ninety-six specimens were made with poly(methylmethacrylate) teeth bonded to a microwave-polymerized acrylic denture base material. The specimens were distributed into 6 groups (n= 16) according to surface treatments: CT - no treatment (control); MN - methylmethacrylate monomer etching; AO - 50 -µm-particle aluminum oxide air abrasion; BR - glaze removal with a round bur; ST - surface grinding with an aluminum oxide abrasive stone; group CV - cavity preparation (diatorics). The control and surface-treated groups were subjected to a compressive load at 45 º angle to the long axis of the teeth. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA, followed by Scheffé's test (p< 0. 05). Bond strength means and (SD) in kgf for groups were: CT: 18. 19 (7. 14), MN: 18. 34 (5. 28), AO: 23. 82 (5. 40), BR: 23. 30 (4. 79), ST: 25. 39 (7. 80) and CV: 17. 48 (7. 17).

40|$|Statement of Problem: The {{problem of}} acrylic resin denture teeth {{separating}} from their denture base remains {{a major problem}} in prosthodontic practice and is frustrating to the patients as well as the dentists. Purpose: This study investigated the influence of tin foil substitute contamination on bond strength between acrylic resin denture teeth and their denture base. Materials and Methods: A total of 80 modified acrylic resin maxillary left central incisors were processed to their denture base material. The 80 specimens were divided into two groups of 40 specimens each: the experimental group and the control group. The experimental group had the denture tooth <b>ridge</b> <b>lap</b> area contaminated with tin foil substitute. The 40 specimens in the control group were not contaminated. After 7 days of storage at room temperature, the bond strengths of the two groups were tested with a universal testing machine. The nature of failure was noted as adhesive (interface) or cohesive (in tooth or denture base material). The Welch test and z-test were performed to identify significant differences. Results: The uncontaminated specimens (group I) showed superior bond strength as compared to the contaminated specimens (group II); the difference in bond strength between the groups was highly significant (P< 0. 0001).

The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of surface treatments on shear bond strength of denture teeth to heat-polymerized and autopolymerized denture base resins. Materials and Methods: In this experimental in vitro study, 60 maxillary central incisor acrylic teeth were divided into two groups. Group M was polymerized with heat-polymerized acrylic resin (Meliodent) by compression molding technique and group F was processed by autopolymerized acrylic resin (Futura Gen) by injection molding technique. Within each group, specimens were divided into three subgroups according to the teeth surface treatments (n = 10) : (1) ground surface as the control group (M 1 and F 1), (2) ground surface combined with monomer application (M 2 and F 2), and (3) airborne particle abrasion by 50 μm Al 2 O 3 (M 3 and F 3). The shear bond strengths of the specimens were tested by universal testing machine with crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey′s honestly significant difference (HSD) tests (P < 0. 05). Results: The mean shear bond strengths of the studied groups were 96. 40 ± 14. 01, 124. 70 ± 15. 64, and 118 ± 16. 38 N for M 1, M 2, and M 3 and 87. 90 ± 13. 48, 117 ± 13. 88, and 109. 70 ± 13. 78 N for F 1, F 2, and F 3, respectively.
