Stabilised ferritic stainless steels are widely used in automotive and cosmetic appliances but are also concerned by sticking phenomenon. These grades, having high dry corrosion and creep resistance, are enriched in specific chemical elements such as Cr, Nb or Ti, limiting also slab oxidation during hot rolling. Nevertheless, the mastered oxidation of slab surface is a way to protect metal surface from direct contact with rolls. In order to better understand initiation of sticking, a first campaign was based on topography and rolls surface state wear analysis. This study revealed that sticking initiation is not due to the presence of <b>roll</b> <b>scratches</b> which depth is higher than oxide layer thickness. Indeed, the probability that <b>roll</b> <b>scratches</b> are deeper than oxide layer thickness is very low. In a second time, a pilot was designed, reproducing tribological conditions of a roll bite, to better understand mechanisms that initiate sticking. Keeping in mind the importance of rolls and slab surface state, this pilot is able to use specimen taking from industrial products, having the original oxide layer surface. This second study highlighted the major role of silicon oxides on scale adherence and the high heterogeneity of this scale layer in thickness and in chemical composition...|$|E

40|$|In hot rolling, the {{asperities}} of oxidised {{strip and}} wear debris slide over High Speed Steel (HSS) work roll. Hence, abrasive wear occurs, and wear particles {{will be removed}} from the work roll surface. This work introduces a Discrete Element Method (DEM) model which has been applied successfully to study abrasive roll wear of HSS work roll with MC carbides embedded within the oxide layers at 650 °C. From this research, it has been found that the carbide orientation, distribution in the HSS <b>roll,</b> different <b>scratching</b> tip size and scratching depth affect the wear significantly...|$|R

Ian Shone, of Horror News, said, [...] "As the credits <b>roll</b> you’re left <b>scratching</b> your head and wondering why anyone ever {{thought it was a}} good idea to take the story in such a feeble and nonsensical direction".|$|R
5000|$|Camp Coker had a {{reputation}} for having excellent food. Mrs. Flora Bull (1922-2007) of Darlington, SC, was first hired by Camp Director Walter S. [...] "Anky" [...] Carter (1925-1994) in 1954. She cooked for the schools in Darlington and at Camp Coker from 1954 to 1980 and 1982-88. Flora's fried chicken was one of the favorite meals. She made dinner <b>rolls</b> from <b>scratch</b> that campers and staff members called [...] "moon rocks". The [...] "moon rocks" [...] were served with a plate of butter. Ice water and iced tea were the usual drinks for meals along with Kool-Aid that was called [...] "bug juice". Orange juice, milk, and coffee for adults were served for breakfast.|$|R

Locomotives and rail cars of the Canandaigua Southern Railroad, all built from <b>scratch,</b> <b>rolled</b> alongside rivers, plains and hillsides — all to scale and covered with hand-made stone, grass and trees—and through complete small towns {{as they were in}} a time when the railroad was so exotic that it would fire any child's imagination.|$|R

Jolly, round, red Mr. Sun hid his face behind a cloud, {{so as not to}} see such a dreadful sight. The stranger had been in many fights and he was very crafty. For a while Johnny felt that he was getting the worst of it, and he began to wonder if he really would have to leave the Green Meadows. The very thought filled him with new rage and he fought harder than ever.|$|R
5000|$|Dumas {{attended}} the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa from 1972-1975 and relocated to Amsterdam in 1976, where she {{attended the}} University of Amsterdam {{as a student}} of painting and psychology from 1979-1980. At this time, Dumas was aspiring to be an abstract painter and was influenced by artists such as Willem de Kooning and Gerhard Richter. The works Dumas produced between 1975 and 1979 demonstrate the development in the artist's characteristic style, where the subject matter; the apartheid in South Africa, is presented in abstract style in painting. As Cornelia Butler, the curator of Dumas's retrospective exhibition [...] "Measuring Your Own Grave" [...] in Tate Modern asserts, [...] "Dumas's paintings are products of the contemporary image world - that is, they are drawn from directly from the events of our time, abstracted to resonate in content and form." [...] In 1984, Dumas started painting heads and figures. These head and figure drawings were usually ink-wash based. Between the years 1979 to 1984, Marlene Dumas took a break from painting, and she primarily produced works on paper. These works are often a collage of drawings in pencil, ink or crayon with a title or a quote, newspaper clippings and magazines and sometimes objects. The paper used would usually be cut from a large <b>roll,</b> <b>scratched,</b> stained and torn. A series of paintings she executed in the mid-1980s, titled [...] "The Eyes of the Night Creatures", explores recurring themes in the artist's oeuvre, including racial and ethical intolerance. Dumas also gained recognition on the European scene for her series of painting in [...] "The Eyes of the Night Creatures." [...] The White Disease (1985) is a painting of an ageing South African woman with pale blue eyes taken from a medical photograph. The painting projects the disease of apartheid and Dumas acknowledges {{it as one of}} her favourites. Christie's auction lot notes observes that the painting recalls the influence of predecessors such as Egon Schiele and Leon Golub. Translucent white paint creates a ghostly shade, alluding to the subject's illness, while water-saturated colors gives the portrait an unreal transparency, suggesting the fugitive nature of life. The shape of the nose is replaced by a simple blob of pink color, symbolising a loss of humanity and the subject's indifference to her state.|$|R
5000|$|Flora did {{not waste}} {{anything}} and her skills {{were one of}} the reasons why excellent food was served within a reasonable budget. This included making good soup out of leftovers. She made sweet <b>rolls</b> from <b>scratch</b> that were usually served on Saturday mornings before camp ended. She made delicious cookies from U.S. Department of Agriculture peanut butter. Her chili and rice, grilled cheese sandwiches, and macaroni and cheese were made from scratch. Leftover butter was melted and put into refrigerated molds to be used again. Her scrambled eggs were made from real eggs that were cracked out of the shell. Staff members would sit with troops when seats were available and this facilitated interaction between the staff and the campers. Scout songs were usually sung after meals led by a member of the staff. The interior light fixtures in the dining hall resemble wagon wheels. Flags from previous Pee Dee Area Council National Jamboree troops were hung from the rafters in the dining hall. Two [...] "awards" [...] that were sometimes presented in the dining hall were the loving cup and the pigs trough for the cleanest and messiest tables.|$|R
