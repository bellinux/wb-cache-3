50|$|In 2001 {{the first}} major upgrade to bearing {{capacity}} was introduced with the MORGOIL KLX® bearing. This bearing uses thin sleeve technology to increase the load bearing area of the <b>radial</b> <b>bearing,</b> allowing more force to be carried in the same space as compared to older designs. The entire axial assembly of this family of bearing was also upgraded to function properly at the increased loads allowed by use of the KLX.|$|E
50|$|If a {{sideways}} torque {{is applied to}} a deep groove <b>radial</b> <b>bearing,</b> an uneven force {{in the shape of}} an ellipse is applied on the outer ring by the rolling elements, concentrating in two regions {{on opposite sides of the}} outer ring. If the outer ring is not strong enough, or if it is not sufficiently braced by the supporting structure, the outer ring will deform into an oval shape from the sideways torque stress, until the gap is large enough for the rolling elements to escape. The inner ring then pops out and the bearing structurally collapses.|$|E
5000|$|In a slot-fill <b>radial</b> <b>bearing,</b> {{the inner}} and outer races are notched on one face so that when the notches are aligned, balls can be slipped in the {{resulting}} slot to assemble the bearing. A slot-fill bearing has the advantage that more balls can be assembled (even allowing a full complement design), resulting in a higher radial load capacity than a Conrad bearing of the same dimensions and material type. However, a slot-fill bearing cannot carry a significant axial load, and the slots cause a discontinuity in the races that can have a small but adverse effect on strength.|$|E

50|$|Early screw-propelled steamships used a {{thrust block}} or thrust box {{composed}} of perhaps a dozen lower-rated plain thrust journal bearings stacked {{on the same}} shaft. These were problematic in service: they were bulky, difficult to dismantle, wasted power through friction {{and they had a}} tendency to overheat. The thrust box was built of a box-like cast iron housing with a <b>radial</b> <b>bearing</b> at each end and a number of collars formed on the shaft between them. This shaft was often a short section of removable shaft called the thrust shaft, linking the engine ahead to the propeller shaft astern. A series of iron horseshoe-shaped collars fitted over the small diameter of the shaft and bore against the forward face of the shaft's collars. Each horseshoe was faced with a low-friction pad of babbitt metal. Lubrication was by an oil bath in the box and a plentiful volume was important for cooling purposes too.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} {{parts of}} a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy steel forging, heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking tapered bore, which fits on, and is keyed to, the tapered Roll Neck, thus becoming the bearing journal. Surrounding the Sleeve is the Bushing, fixed in the Chock, which carries the radial load. The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is the Thrust Bearing, which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications {{depending on the size}} of the <b>radial</b> <b>bearing).</b> The Thrust Bearing is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the thrust load and is not subject to any radial loading.|$|E

40|$|The unique {{features}} and {{applications of the}} presented electrical permanent magnetic bearing system essentially result from three facts: (1) the only bearing rotor components are nonlaminated ferromagnetic steel collars or cylinders; (2) all radial and axial forces are transmitted via radial gaps; and (3) large <b>radial</b> <b>bearing</b> gaps can be provided with minimum electric power consumption.

40|$|The Electron Energy Corporation (EEC) {{along with}} the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is researching {{magnetic}} bearings. The purpose {{of this research was}} to design and develop a high-temperature (1000 ?F) magnetic bearing system using High Temperature Permanent Magnets (HTPM), developed by the EEC. The entire system consisted of two radial bearings, one thrust bearing, one motor and 2 sets of catcher bearings. This high temperature magnetic bearing system will be used in high performance, high speed and high temperature applications like space vehicles, jet engines and deep sea equipment. The bearing system had a target design to carry a load equal to 500 lb-f (2225 N). Another objective was to design and build a test rig fixture to measure the load capacity of the designed high temperature radial magnetic bearing (HTRMB) called <b>Radial</b> <b>Bearing</b> Force Test Rig (RBFTR). A novel feature of this high temperature magnetic bearing is its homopolar construction which incorporates state of the art high temperature, 1000 ?F, permanent magnets. A second feature is its fault tolerance capability which provides the desired control forces even if half the coils have failed. The permanent magnet bias of the radial magnetic bearing reduces the amount of current required for magnetic bearing operation. This reduces the power loss due to the coil current resistance and also increases the system efficiency because magnetic field of the HTPM is used to take up the major portion of the static load on the bearing. The bias flux of the homopolar <b>radial</b> <b>bearing</b> is produced by the EEC HTPM to reduce the related ohmic losses of an electromagnetic circuit significantly. An experimental procedure was developed using the <b>Radial</b> <b>Bearing</b> Force Test Rig (RBTFR) to measure actual load capacity of the designed bearing at the test rig.
