5|$|Returning to {{differential}} equations, Hamming studied {{means of}} numerically integrating them. A popular approach {{at the time}} was Milne's Method, attributed to Arthur Milne. This had the drawback of being unstable, so that under certain conditions the <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> swamped by roundoff noise. Hamming developed an improved version, the Hamming predictor-corrector. This was in use for many years, but has since been superseded by the Adams method. He did extensive research into digital filters, devising a new filter, the Hamming window, and eventually writing an entire book on the subject, Digital Filters (1977).|$|E

25|$|Although it was {{originally}} developed in this very particular and physically unrealistic context in string theory, the entropy calculation of Strominger and Vafa {{has led to a}} qualitative understanding of how black hole entropy can be accounted for in any theory of quantum gravity. Indeed, in 1998, Strominger argued that the original <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> generalized to an arbitrary consistent theory of quantum gravity without relying on strings or supersymmetry. In collaboration with several other authors in 2010, he showed that some results on black hole entropy could be extended to non-extremal astrophysical black holes.|$|E
25|$|It had {{previously}} been proposed, by George FitzGerald in 1889 and by Lorentz in 1892, independently of each other, that the Michelson-Morley <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> accounted for if moving bodies were contracted {{in the direction of}} their motion. Some of the paper's core equations, the Lorentz transforms, had been published by Joseph Larmor (1897, 1900), Hendrik Lorentz (1895, 1899, 1904) and Henri Poincaré (1905), in a development of Lorentz's 1904 paper. Einstein's presentation differed from the explanations given by FitzGerald, Larmor, and Lorentz, but was similar in many respects to the formulation by Poincaré (1905).|$|E
25|$|A {{workshop}} on {{the limitations of}} size of microbes in 1999 found that though modern nanobacteria can't be smaller in volume than {{the interior of a}} sphere of diameter 250 ± 50nm, primitive microorganisms based on a single-polymer system could be. They cite the example of RNA based life, with ribozymes (catalytic RNA) taking the place of the much larger ribosomes as enzymes for cell replication. The cells also wouldn't have proteins and would have no need to translate DNA to mRNA. The <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> cells as small as a sphere 50nm in diameter. These RNA World cells are one of the suggestions made {{to bridge the gap between}} abiotic chemistry and modern cells.|$|E

25|$|These {{barriers}} {{have also}} led some computer scientists {{to suggest that}} the P versus NP problem may be independent of standard axiom systems like ZFC (cannot be proved or disproved within them). The interpretation of an independence <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> that either no polynomial-time algorithm exists for any NP-complete problem, and such a proof cannot be constructed in (e.g.) ZFC, or that polynomial-time algorithms for NP-complete problems may exist, but it is impossible to prove in ZFC that such algorithms are correct. However, if it can be shown, using techniques of the sort that are currently known to be applicable, that the problem cannot be decided even with much weaker assumptions extending the Peano axioms (PA) for integer arithmetic, then there would necessarily exist nearly-polynomial-time algorithms for every problem in NP. Therefore, if one believes (as most complexity theorists do) that not all problems in NP have efficient algorithms, it would follow that proofs of independence using those techniques cannot be possible. Additionally, this result implies that proving independence from PA or ZFC using currently known techniques is no easier than proving the existence of efficient algorithms for all problems in NP.|$|E
25|$|Both sides had {{realised}} that no decisive <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> achieved {{until the}} spring and reverted to a defensive posture involving aggressive patrolling and artillery duels whilst they worked to rebuild their fighting capabilities. In anticipation of the following spring, Kesselring ordered the preparation of a new defence line, the Caesar C line, behind the line of beachhead running {{from the mouth of}} the river Tiber just south of Rome through Albano, skirting south of the Alban Hills to Valmontone and across Italy to the Adriatic coast at Pescara, behind which 14th Army and, to their left, 10th Army might withdraw when the need arose. Meanwhile, Lucian Truscott, who had been promoted from the command of U.S. 3rdInfantry Division to replace Lucas as commander of VICorps on February22, worked with his staff on the plans for a decisive attack as part of a general offensive which Alexander was planning for May and which would include a major offensive on the Gustav Line, Operation Diadem. The objective of the plan was to fully engage Kesselring's armies with a major offensive and remove any prospect of the Germans withdrawing forces from Italy to redeploy elsewhere. It was also intended to trap the bulk of the German 10th Army between the Allied forces advancing through the Gustav Line and VICorps thrusting inland from Anzio.|$|E
25|$|Next (or in {{the opinion}} of some, first) in {{importance}} stand the memoirs on celestial mechanics, in which he proved himself a worthy successor to Pierre-Simon Laplace. The most important of these are his memoirs Sur les inégalités séculaires des moyens mouvements des planètes, Sur la variation des constantes arbitraires dans les questions de mécanique, both published in the Journal of the École Polytechnique (1809); Sur la libration de la lune, in Connaissance des temps (1821), etc.; and , in Mémoires de l'Académie (1827), etc. In the first of these memoirs, Poisson discusses the famous question of the stability of the planetary orbits, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation for the disturbing forces. Poisson showed that the <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> extended to a second approximation, and thus made an important advance in planetary theory. The memoir is remarkable inasmuch as it roused Lagrange, after an interval of inactivity, to compose in his old age one of the greatest of his memoirs, entitled Sur la théorie des variations des éléments des planètes, et en particulier des variations des grands axes de leurs orbites. So highly did he think of Poisson's memoir that he made a copy of it with his own hand, which was found among his papers after his death. Poisson made important contributions to the theory of attraction.|$|E

25|$|People of all {{languages}} rely to {{some extent}} on visual information in speech perception, but {{the intensity of the}} McGurk effect can change between languages. Dutch, English, Spanish, German and Italian language listeners experience a robust McGurk effect, while it is weaker for Japanese and Chinese listeners. Most research on the McGurk effect between languages has been conducted between English and Japanese. There is a smaller McGurk effect in Japanese listeners than in English listeners. The cultural practice of face avoidance in Japanese people may {{have an effect on the}} McGurk effect, as well as tone and syllabic structures of the language. This could also be why Chinese listeners are less susceptible to visual cues, and similar to Japanese, produce a smaller effect than English listeners. Studies have also shown that Japanese listeners do not show a developmental increase in visual influence after the age of six, as English children do. Japanese listeners are more able to identify an incompatibility between the visual and auditory stimulus than English listeners are. This <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> in relation to the fact that in Japanese, consonant clusters do not exist. In noisy environments where speech is unintelligible, however, people of all languages resort to using visual stimuli and are then equally subject to the McGurk effect. The McGurk effect works with speech perceivers of every language for which it has been tested.|$|E
500|$|He renewed {{correspondence}} with officials in Massachusetts {{in the hopes}} of winning appointment as an agent representing the province's interests, but was unsuccessful. [...] He regularly received visitors from the colonies, and Benjamin Franklin, his old friend from Pennsylvania, was a frequent guest. [...] He observed with alarm the rise in tension in the colonies and the missteps of Parliamentary leadership and colonial administration that exacerbated rather than reduced them. [...] He used his position in Parliament to highlight the colonial objections to the Quartering Act of 1765 and other unpopular legislation. [...] When troops were sent to Boston in 1768 after protests against the Townshend Acts turned violent, he took to the floor of Parliament, warning that the connections between Britain and the colonies were unraveling, and that the end <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> a permanent breach.|$|E
500|$|Another {{well-known}} {{story is}} that the actors did not know until {{the last day of}} shooting how the film was to end. The original play (set entirely in the cafe) ended with Rick sending Ilsa and Laszlo to the airport. During scriptwriting, the possibility was discussed of Laszlo being killed in Casablanca, allowing Rick and Ilsa to leave together, but as Casey Robinson wrote to Hal Wallis before filming began, the ending of the film [...] "set up for a swell twist when Rick sends her away on the plane with Laszlo. For now, in doing so, he is not just solving a love triangle. He is forcing the girl {{to live up to the}} idealism of her nature, forcing her to carry on with the work that in these days is far more important than the love of two little people." [...] It was certainly impossible for Ilsa to leave Laszlo for Rick, as the production code forbade showing a woman leaving her husband for another man. The concern was not whether Ilsa would leave with Laszlo, but how this <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> engineered. The problem was solved when the Epstein brothers, Julius and Philip, were driving down Sunset Boulevard and stopped for the light at Beverly Glen. At that instant the identical twins turned to each other and simultaneously cried out, [...] "Round up the usual suspects!" [...] By the time they had driven past Fairfax and the Cahuenga Pass and through the Warner Brothers studio's portals at Burbank, in the words of Julius Epstein, [...] "the idea for the farewell scene between a tearful Bergman and a suddenly noble Bogart" [...] had been formed and all the problems of the ending had been solved. The confusion was probably caused by Bergman's later statement that she did not know which man she was meant to be in love with. Rewrites did occur during the filming, but Aljean Harmetz's examination of the scripts has shown that many of the key scenes were shot after Bergman knew how the film would end; any confusion was, in critic Roger Ebert's words, [...] "emotional", not [...] "factual".|$|E

2500|$|Building off {{previous}} work done on an Aloha model, the coverage probability {{for the typical}} user was derived for a Poisson network. The Poisson model of a cellular network proves to be more tractable than a hexagonal model. Meanwhile, this observation could be argued {{by the fact that}} a detailed and precise derivation for the channel attenuation probability distribution function between a random node and a reference base-station for a hexagonal model was explicitly derived in; and this <b>result</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used to tractably derive the outage probability. Furthermore, in the presence of sufficiently large log-normal shadow fading (or shadowing) and a singular power-law attenuation function, it was [...] observed [...] by simulation [...] for hexagonal networks and then later mathematically proved [...] for general stationary (including hexagonal) networks that quantities like the SINR and SIR of the typical user behave stochastically as though the underlying network were Poisson. In other words, given a [...] power-law attention function, using a Poisson cellular network model with [...] constant shadowing is equivalent (in terms of SIR, SINR, etc.) to assuming large log-normal shadowing in the mathematical model with the base stations positioned according to either a deterministic or random configuration with a constant density.|$|E
2500|$|While {{continuing}} to choose her subjects from her immediate urban environment, Fish changed her approach roughly {{at the turn}} of the century. Closely observed objects such as sections of floor tile and asphalt siding gave way to abstractly rendered thresholds, stairs and stair landings, a light fixture, and floor plans of rooms in her home. Like her earlier work, these paintings, she said, were impressed on the surface of the canvas in a way that approximated the experience of seeing the same things over and over, day after day. She came to see transitions as the subject of her work, the sense of walking across a threshold, moving from room to room; or the sense of light moving through a room during the day and into it from a wall fixture at night. She understood such transitions to be both actual and metaphorical. The visual elements she put on her canvases were meant to convey physical objects but also her own motion through the spaces they represented and the light that came from fixtures in the rooms and through the windows.
