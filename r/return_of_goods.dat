2500|$|Unlike pre-Islamic Arabian society, the Qur'anic idea of {{economic}} circulation as a <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and obligations was for everyone, whether {{donors and recipients}} know each other or not, in which goods move, and society does what {{it is supposed to}} do. The Qur'an's distinctive set {{of economic}} and social arrangements, in which poverty and the poor have important roles, show signs of newness. The Qur'an told that the guidance comes to a community that regulates its flow of money and goods in the right direction (from top down) and practices generosity as reciprocation for God's bounty. In a broad sense, the narrative underlying the Qur'an is that of a tribal society becoming urbanized. Many scholars, such as Charles C. Torrey and Andrew Rippin, have characterized both the Qur'an and Islam as highly favorable to commerce and to the highly mobile type of society that emerged in the medieval Near East. Muslim tradition (both hadith and historiography) maintains that Muhammad did not permit the construction of any buildings in the market of Medina other than mere tents; nor did he permit any tax or rent to be taken there. This expression of a [...] "free market"—involving the circulation of goods within a single space without payment of fees, taxes, or rent, without the construction of permanent buildings, and without any profiting {{on the part of the}} caliphal authority (indeed, of the Caliph himself)—was rooted in the term sadaqa, [...] "voluntary alms". This coherent and highly appealing view of the economic universe had much to do with Islam's early and lasting success. Since the poor were at the heart of this economic universe, the teachings of the Qur'an on poverty had a considerable, even a transforming effect in Arabia, the Near East, and beyond.|$|E

Upon the theory, for which he {{deserved}} the credit, of giving to a country place the advantages of one of the great city establishments, he was gradually gathering, in their fashion, the small commerce into his hands. He had already opened his bazaar through into the adjoining store, which he had bought out, and he kept every sort of thing desired or needed in a country town, with a tempting stock of articles before unknown to the shopkeepers of Hatboro'. Everything was of the very quality represented; the prices were low, but inflexible, and cash payments, except in the case of some rich customers of unimpeachable credit, were invariably exacted; at the same time every reasonable facility for the exchange or <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> was afforded. Nothing could exceed the justice and fidelity of his dealing with the public.

Similarly for the negative side. When we respond to bad things, reciprocity presumably requires a return that the recipient regards as a bad thing.|$|R

The manufacturer sells his goods to retailer and offers a contract in which he can accept <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> unsold to consumers depending on states of demand.

We show that returnability and resale price maintenance are more beneficial to manufacturer and consumers than flexible price regime.
