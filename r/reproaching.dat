25|$|The novel {{begins with}} newborn Hephaestus (the titular god beneath the sea) cast from Mount Olympus {{by his mother}} Hera. He is raised in a grotto by Thetis and Eurynome and the two goddesses tell him various Greek {{creation}} myths. The novel continues with myths of the Olympians {{and the age of}} gods and mortals, and concludes with Hephaestus returning to Olympus, having been cast down for a second time after <b>reproaching</b> Zeus.|$|E
25|$|The {{ambivalent}} {{attitude to}} Messalina {{can be seen}} in the late mediaeval French prose work in the J. Paul Getty Museum illustrated by the Master of Boucicaut, Tiberius, Messalina, and Caligula reproach one another in the midst of flames. It recounts a dialogue that takes place in hell between the three characters from the same imperial line. Messalina wins the debate by demonstrating that their sins were far worse than hers and suggests that they repent of their own wickedness before <b>reproaching</b> her as they had done.|$|E

Seeing his daughter, Lorenzo decides to give his blessing to her union with the nobleman Gamache. Basilio becomes annoyed and, <b>reproaching</b> Kitri for her unfaithfulness, draws a sword and stabs himself. As he lies dying he begs Lorenzo to unite him with Kitri, but Lorenzo and Gamache refuse. Don Quixote approaches Gamache and challenges him to a duel for having refused a dying man's wish. Gamache declines to fight and the merrymakers drive him out of the inn. Taking pity, Lorenzo agrees to unite Basilio and Kitri. At this moment, Basilio pulls out the sword and tells everyone it was a joke.|$|E
25|$|The God Beneath the Sea {{is divided}} into three parts. Part one begins with the image of the infant Hephaestus plummeting from Olympus to the ocean. Thetis saves the baby and takes him to the grotto she shares with Eurynome. They raise the baby, telling him stories of Greek myths and giving him a hammer and anvil to play with. Part one concludes with Hermes {{inviting}} Hephaestus back to Olympus at Hera's bequest, and Hephaestus claiming Aphrodite for his wife. Part two tells the myths of Prometheus and Pandora, and part three tells various myths of gods interacting with mortals. The novel concludes with the Olympians unsuccessfully attempting to overthrow Zeus, and Hephaestus returning to Olympus from Lemnos, having been cast down from Olympus for a second time after <b>reproaching</b> Zeus.|$|E
25|$|The brief {{conflict}} between Malacca and Lê Dynasty of Annam, began {{shortly after the}} 1471 Vietnamese invasion of Champa, then already a Muslim kingdom. The Chinese government, without knowing about the event, sent a censor Ch'en Chun to Champa in 1474 to install the Champa King, but he discovered Vietnamese soldiers had taken over Champa and were blocking his entry. He proceeded to Malacca instead and its ruler sent back tribute to China. In 1469, Malaccan envoys on their return from China was attacked by the Vietnamese who castrated the young and enslaved them. In view of Lê Dynasty's position as a protectorate to China, Malacca abstained from any act of retaliation. Instead, Malacca sent envoys to China in 1481 {{to report on the}} Vietnamese aggression and their invasion plan against Malacca, as well as to confront the Vietnamese envoys who happened to be present in the Ming court. However, the Chinese informed that since the incident was years old, they could do nothing about it, and the Emperor {{sent a letter to the}} Vietnamese ruler <b>reproaching</b> him for the incident. The Chinese Emperor also granted permission for Malacca to retaliate with violent force should the Vietnamese attack, an event that never happened again after that.|$|E

25|$|In 882, the caliph al-Mu'tamid {{tried to}} escape the control of his brother al-Muwaffaq and made contact with Ahmad ibn Tulun, the {{powerful}} Turkish general who controlled Egypt, Syria {{and parts of the}} southeastern Jazira as well. Although nominally recognizing Abbasid suzerainty, Ibn Tulun was an autonomous ruler, and a rival to al-Muwaffaq. Trusting in Ibn Tulun's pledge of assistance, the Caliph, accompanied by a few trusted aides, left the capital Samarra and went to the Jazira, hoping from there to cross over into Tulunid territory. Ibn Kundaj, who had already received letters from al-Muwaffaq ordering the arrest of the Caliph and his followers, at first presented himself as sympathizing with the Caliph's plight and willing to aid them, but at an opportune moment seized the caliph and his attendants, throwing the latter in chains. After <b>reproaching</b> the Caliph for abandoning his brother who was struggling to save the dynasty and the empire, he sent the caliphal party back to Samarra. Ibn Kundaj was greatly rewarded for this: not only were the estates of the Caliph's companions confiscated and granted to him, but four days after delivering his prisoners to Samarra, on 22 January 883, he was given robes of honour and two ceremonial swords, receiving the title of Dhu al-Sayfayn ("He of the Two Swords"), followed later by more rich gifts and lunches with the grandees of the Abbasid court. At the insistence of al-Muwaffaq, the powerless Caliph was now forced to order the name of Ibn Tulun publicly cursed from the mosques, with all the offices of the latter conferred on Ibn Kundaj. This meant little in practice, as neither the Abbasid government nor Ibn Kundaj possessed the force to wrest Ibn Tulun's territories from him, but, along with his appointment to command the Caliph's private guard (shurtat al-khassa), it made Ibn Kundaj nominally {{one of the most powerful}} men of the Caliphate.|$|E
500|$|After John Johnson left on {{a voyage}} in May 1817 Jane decided to leave him for Edward Ellerker Williams, to whom {{she may have been}} {{introduced}} by John. Williams was an Eton College graduate who had served in the Navy before becoming a lieutenant in the 8th Dragoons. Edwards had inherited enough money from his father, a military historian and descendant of Oliver Cromwell, to allow them to live comfortably. Although they never legally married, she became his common-law wife and began referring to herself as Mrs. Jane Williams. Their relationship initially drew disapprobation from their families, with Jane's brother and Edward's stepmother <b>reproaching</b> them for their decisions. Jane's brother later apologised, and declared Johnson a [...] "vile fellow". Edward's stepmother, however, always resented Jane. Though long distance mail moved very slowly then, Jane and her husband exchanged angry letters shortly after she left him for Edward. When John returned to London in late 1818, he made no attempt to force Jane to return to him, although it was his legal right to do so.|$|E
500|$|Nurmi {{felt that}} he got too much credit as an athlete and too little as a businessman, but his {{interest}} in running never died. He even returned to the track himself a few times. In 1946, he faced his old rival Edvin Wide in Stockholm in {{a benefit for the}} victims of the Greek Civil War. Nurmi ran for the last time on 18 February 1966 at the Madison Square Garden, invited by the New York Athletic Club. In 1962, Nurmi predicted that welfare countries would start to struggle in the distance events: [...] "The higher the standard of living in a country, the weaker the results often are in the events which call for work and trouble. I would like to warn this new generation: 'Do not let this comfortable life make you lazy. Do not let the new means of transport kill your instinct for physical exercise. Too many young people get used to driving in a car even for small distances.'" [...] In 1966, he took the microphone in front of 300 sports club guests and criticised the state of distance running in Finland, <b>reproaching</b> the sports executives as publicity seekers and tourists, and demanding athletes sacrifice everything to accomplish something. Nurmi lived to see the renaissance of Finnish running in the 1970s, led by athletes such as the 1972 Olympic gold medalists Lasse Virén and Pekka Vasala. He had complimented the running style of Virén, and advised Vasala to concentrate on Kipchoge Keino.|$|E
5000|$|In the Anglican Church {{during the}} English Reformation, the <b>Reproaches</b> were {{suppressed}} by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury when he authored the first Book of Common Prayer {{in the sixteenth}} century. However, the liturgical movement {{and the desire to}} connect with ancient liturgical traditions has led to some Provinces in the Anglican Communion to reintroduce the <b>Reproaches.</b> For example, the revisers of the 1989 Anglican Prayer Book in the Anglican Church of Southern Africa to reintroduce the <b>Reproaches</b> as “The Solemn Adoration of Christ Crucified.” [...] The revisers of the Anglican Prayer Book have sought to downplay the historical anti-Semitism associated with the <b>Reproaches.</b> In the Anglican Church of Korea, the <b>Reproaches</b> (책망가) have been traditionally sung since the beginning during the Veneration of the Cross.|$|R

2500|$|Secondly, Rouen – {{the site}} of the trial – was also still held by the English. The {{documents}} relating to the original trial were kept in Rouen, and the town did not fall into Charles VII's hands until November 1449. Historian Régine Pernoud makes the point that [...] "So long as the English were masters of Rouen, the mere fact that they held the papers in the case, a case which they had managed themselves, maintained their version of what the trial had been". She adds: [...] "to reproach the King or the Church with having done nothing until that time is tantamount to <b>reproaching</b> the French government with having done nothing to bring the Oradour war criminals to justice before 1945".|$|E

2500|$|Both Faber and Bril knew Rubens, {{who was in}} Rome in 1601, and {{who became}} another friend, later <b>reproaching</b> Elsheimer for not {{producing}} more work.

In 1604 Karel van Mander, a Dutchman recently returned from Rome, published his Schilder-Boeck which praised Elsheimer's work, and described him as slow-working and making few drawings. He also spent much time in churches, studying the works of the masters. [...] Other writers mention his exceptional visual memory, his melancholy and his kind-heartedness.

2500|$|Carp {{made his}} leading {{contribution}} with speeches, and is traditionally {{regarded as one}} of the top orators in his generation. According to Ion Bulei, his voice was shrill, with an exotic Moldavian lilt, but Carp always imposed himself by being [...] "intelligent and concise", in sharp contrast with the [...] "Romantic phraseology" [...] of his contemporaries. As a public speaker, Carp sometimes resumed his earlier press debates with the PNL, notably by <b>reproaching</b> on his adversaries that they were enshrining Romania's own version of Whig history. He was especially upset by the accolades bestowed on PNL men for their supposed roles in obtaining Romanian independence. In 1886 Carp offered an alternative Junimist narrative of how [...] "national sovereignty" [...] came about, with only two actors: [...] "the king and the foot soldier".|$|E
