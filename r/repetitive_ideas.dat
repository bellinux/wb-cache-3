There have been many deliberate omissions for reasons which become clear in the text. Very briefly, omissions of certain sculptors and their work are largely due to my wish to avoid <b>repetitive</b> <b>ideas</b> and images. My view in this essay is to provide a cross-section of ideas and works, whereby the reader might gain some insight into the varied nature of this kind of sculpture. Thus, there seemed very little need for endless similarities of concept and expression. It was the diversity which I felt was important. The chapter which discusses concepts of beauty is also not a comprehensive study. This subject demands more than a humble essay to do it any justice. However, my reasons for touching the vague and controversial outline of these concepts were, primarily, to suggest that notions of beauty as the sole criterion in the judgement of art are too limiting, and, consequently, to introduce the concept of vitalism, which I believe is more valid. Finally, I wish to mention the personal motive behind this work. Over the years, I have witnessed the emergence of brutal elements in my own work, which I found disturbing at times. I {{have never been able to}} answer satisfactorily the criticism I've received. All I knew was that these things came from a very deep source. It is with this in mind that I embarked on this project, hoping to achieve two things. Firstly, to provide an objective survey of an important development in art, and, secondly, to answer some of my criticism. Foreword, p. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the axioms, of axiomatic design, are {{extended}} to the non-probabilistic and <b>repetitive</b> events. The <b>idea</b> of information, in the classic theories of Fisher andWiener–Shannon, is a measure only of probabilistic and <b>repetitive</b> events. The <b>idea</b> of information is broader than the probability. The Wiener–Shannon’s axioms are {{extended to the}} non-probabilistic and repetitiveness events. It is possible {{the introduction of a}} theory of information for events not connected to the probability therefore for non-repetitive events. On the basis of the so-called Laplace’s principle of insufficient knowledge, the MaxInf Principle is defined for choose solutions in absence of knowledge. In this paper the value of information, as a measure of equality of data among a set of values, is applied in axiomatic framework for data analysis in such cases in which the number of functional requirements (FRs) is greater than the design parameter’s (DPs) one. As example is studied an application in which the number of DPs is lower then the number of FRs, and the coupled design cannot be satisfied. A typical example in which that happens is in the evaluation of the potential failure mechanisms, failure stresses, failure sites, and failure modes, given a product architecture, the comprising products and materials, and the manufacturing processes. In design analysis it is possible to hypothesise several causes that can affect the normal functionalities of some products/processes’ parts and to individuate several possible effect that those causes can cause. In ideal analysis, each functional requirement (effect) must be linked to one design parameter (cause), and vice versa each design parameter can satisfy one (or more) functional parameter. From the system of equations it turns out that with the number of FR < DP it is possible to have only approximate solutions. In this situation the number of DPs is insufficient to achieve all the FR in exact mode. Respecting the following statements: • In absence of solution is not possible compare anything: is needed at least a solution. • Using mathematical transformations it is possible to obtain a marginal solution. Using the idea of information in metric space, in according with Maximum Entropy Principle of Jaynes it is possible to select as solution the distribution that maximise the Shannon entropy measure and simultaneously is consistent with the values of constraints. So this method allows to solve the Axiomatic framework and to reason for obtain the best design solution...|$|R
40|$|Potentials {{of virtual}} {{environment}} for enhancing creativity of architects have shaped this research. There is no singular definition of creativity. In fact, {{there are more}} than 100 different definitions for creativity according to different contexts and disciplines. Nevertheless, it is possible to confine the boundaries of definitions and address creativity within a confined framework.   The first practical step was thus to perform an in-depth literature survey to define a boundary condition for the widespread topic of “creativity” and identify vital research questions pertaining to creativity. In this regard, personality and behavior of creative people; mood, state, temper, intelligence vs. creativity, motivation and so forth were ignored. Instead, cognitive aspects of creativity such as thinking patterns, conceptual blending, idea expansion and tolerance of ambiguity have been focused upon. The second step was to test whether starting a design procedure with a 2 or a 3 -dimensional mode of thinking has any correlation with creativity. An experiment pertaining to this test was designed in which participants were asked to perform the same design task once with 2 D tools and environments (e. g. traditional pen and paper) and the next time by applying 3 D tools and environments (e. g. 3 D software). A jury of experts in the field of design subjectively compared the results and arrived at a conclusion that participates generated more creative ideas by implementing 3 D environments/tools.   The third step, involved the introduction of unconventional virtual environments (UVEs), which subsequently lead {{to the creation of a}} hypothesis. This hypothesis tries to connect navigation in UVEs with the enhancement of creativity.   Characteristics of UVEs and theoretical arguments around the hypothesis were also discussed.   The fourth step, involved a discussion on two effective parameters of creativity: 1 - Tolerance of ambiguity 2 - Conceptual blending Attempts to verify these parameters, lead to the formulation of two separate experiments. The conclusions of these experiments were as follows: 1 -  Tolerance of ambiguity has a direct relationship with creativity. Architects deal with multiple parameters during a typical design process. The ability to meaningfully process the relationships between such a multitude of parameters has also trained architects to possess a higher level of tolerance of ambiguity aiding them in postponing making hasty judgements. 2 -  By combining different ideas, one can formulate newer and much novel ideas. Ideas tend to become creative when more remote ideas are combined and synthesized. In order to prevent <b>repetitive</b> and self-similar <b>ideas,</b> the unconscious mind needs to be fed with more ideas, which the mind has not been exposed to. These new ideas/experiences can be generated by exposing one’s self to UVEs, since UVEs can expose one to situations and experiences which the brain cannot experience in the physical world. The fifth step, aims at understanding how the brain perceives different environments. Three different environments were chosen for an experimental study pertaining to the same: 1 - Abstract environment 2 - Semi-designed environment and 3 - Fully designed environment. Participants were asked to provide a feedback by answering a questionnaire after navigating each of these environments. Simultaneously, their brain activity patterns were recorded via a professional neuropsychology apparatus. After analyzing the brain activities, in conjunction with the questionnaire, it became clear that perception of an abstract environment is completely different from the perception of a Semi-designed or Fully designed environment.   This experiment consolidated the hypothesis that UVEs as abstract designed environments activate parts of the brain that are correlate with creativity. The sixth step, involved putting the hypothesis to a final test. A conclusive experiment was thus designed. The experiment won the Visionair fund of FP 7 and was conducted in Italy. A UVE was designed using the software 3 D max and was converted to 3 D stereoscopic mode using a specific software: GIOVE; developed in ITIA-CNR, Italy. Using a 3 D goggle and 6 axis mouse, a group of 20 participants were asked to navigate the UVE. They were asked to provide a written feedback pertaining to their feelings, expectations, strategy of navigation and in general, their experience. Their responses were collected and analyzed. The final step, involved answering the formulated research questions and discussing the final results...|$|R
