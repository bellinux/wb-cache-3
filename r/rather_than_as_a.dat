5|$|Although {{it appears}} that {{globular}} clusters contain {{some of the first}} stars to be produced in the galaxy, their origins and their role in galactic evolution are still unclear. It does appear clear that globular clusters are significantly different from dwarf elliptical galaxies and were formed as part of the star formation of the parent galaxy <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> separate galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Both {{versions}} of the game received mixed reviews according to the review aggregator site Metacritic. The main problems reviewers had with the game was its repetitiveness and the tediousness of some parts. Reviewers highly praised its narrative, and some reviewers {{thought that it would}} work better as a short film, or an audio drama, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> game.|$|E

5|$|There {{have also}} {{been a number of}} {{translations}} which aim to present the Gododdin as literature <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> subject of scholarly study. Examples are the translation by Joseph P. Clancy in The earliest Welsh poetry (1970) and Steve Short's 1994 translation.|$|E
5|$|After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, and {{the closure}} of Vale Royal Abbey in 1538, St Padarn's Church regained its independence, though now solely as a parish church <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{religious}} community. The church remained important {{in part because the}} parish was {{one of the largest in}} Wales (over 240 square miles). However, although the Abbot of Vale Royal was no longer rector, the church did not recover the tithes, nor the ownership of the lands that had once belonged to the church.|$|E

5|$|An Lushan was a Tang {{general of}} mixed Turkic and Soghdian ancestry whose revolt between 755 and 763, the An Shi Rebellion, devastated the Tang Dynasty. Unlike the {{majority}} of Turkic military officers, An Lushan served the Tang as an official closely involved with {{the politics of the}} imperial court, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> general in a garrison on the Tang frontier. The dynasty might have collapsed {{had it not been for}} their alliance with the Uyghur Turks. The rebellion diminished the Tang enthusiasm for cosmopolitanism that was a characteristic of the dynasty's earlier years.|$|E
5|$|Breuer {{attended}} the Paralympics in London, {{but as a}} wheelchair basketball player <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fencer. She {{was introduced to the}} sport by a friend, and spotted by a national trainer. Breuer played for Sabines Ulm, where she was the only woman on a mixed gender side. She is classified as a 1.5 point player, but women get a 1.5 point bonus when playing on a mixed team, making her in effect a zero-point player. Her classification, along with her high technical acumen, means that she is a valuable asset on any team.|$|E
5|$|Carucage was {{an attempt}} to secure new sources of revenue in order to {{supplement}} and increase royal income in a time when new demands were being made on royal finances. Although derived from the older danegeld, carucage was an experiment in revenue collection, but it was only levied for specific purposes, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> regularly assessed tax. Also new was the fact later collections were imposed with the consent of the barons. However, the main flow of royal income was from other sources, and carucage was not collected again after 1224.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{uses the}} unique molecular recognition properties of DNA and other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus {{used as a}} structural material <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> carrier of biological information. This {{has led to the}} creation of two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the DNA origami method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins.|$|E
5|$|In later {{editions of}} the book, Darwin traced {{evolutionary}} ideas {{as far back as}} Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church Fathers and Medieval European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life.|$|E

Roberts said that the nurses filed the complaint as a personal vendetta <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> good faith reporting of facts. He also noted that Mitchell and Galle sent the medical records of ten patients to the TMB without their consent; however, the reports {{did not include the}} names of patients and federal law exempts medical board reports from patient privacy laws.|$|E
5|$|Mycenaean {{domestic}} architecture originates {{mainly from}} earlier Middle Helladic traditions (c. 2000–1650 BC) both in shape, {{as well as}} in location of settlement. The observed uniformity in domestic architecture came probably {{as a result of a}} shared past among the communities of the Greek mainland <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> consequence of cultural expansion of the Mycenaean Koine. Moreover, varying sizes of mudbricks were used in the construction of buildings.|$|E

5|$|The Firebrand is an 1987 {{historical}} fantasy {{novel by}} American author Marion Zimmer Bradley. Set {{in the ancient}} city of Troy, the novel is a re-telling of Homer's epic poem, the Iliad. The Firebrand is written {{from the point of}} view of Kassandra, the prophet daughter of King Priam of Troy, and also features other prominent characters from Greek mythology. As in the Iliad, Kassandra foresees catastrophe for her city but few pay heed to her warnings. In Bradley's story, Kassandra is presented as a strong and insightful woman, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sufferer of insanity.|$|E

Work on the machine began in 1947, and on 21 June 1948 the computer successfully ran its first program, consisting of 17 instructions written to find the highest proper factor of 218 (262,144) by trying every integer from 218 − 1 downwards. The program ran for 52minutes before producing the correct answer of 131,072.|$|E

Other small birds {{may also be}} attacked. The male is inquisitive and fearless, attacking even dangerous predators like the stoat if they approach the nest, as well as egg-thieves like the Eurasian jay. His song, given from a favoured prominent vantage point, appears {{to be used to}} advertise an established territory and contact the female, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> paternity guard strategy.|$|E
