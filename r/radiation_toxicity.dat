Methods: Thirty-eight patients with stage III NSCLC were randomly divided into a control group and a combined treatment group. The control group only received chest three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, while the combined treatment group received low-dose splenic irradiation followed by chest three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy after 6  hours. T lymphocyte subsets of the blood cells were tested before, during, and after treatment once a week. The side effects induced by radiation were observed, and a follow-up was done to observe the survival statistics. Results: The ratio differences in CD 4 + cells, CD 8 + cells, and CD 4 +/CD 8 + before and after treatment were not statistically significant (P> 0. 05) in both the groups. The immune indexes were also not statistically significant (P> 0. 05) before and after radiotherapy in the combined treatment group. However, the numbers of CD 4 + cells and CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratios before radiotherapy were higher than after radiotherapy in the control group. There were no differences in the incidence of <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicities</b> between the two groups; however, the incidence of grade III or IV <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicities</b> was lower, and the dose at which the <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicities</b> appeared was higher in the combined treatment group. The total response rate was 63. 16 % (12 / 19) in the combined treatment group vs 42. 11 % (8 / 19) in the control group. The median 2 -year progression-free survival (15  months in the combined treatment group vs 10  months in the control group) was statistically significant (P 0. 05). Conclusion: Low-dose radiation can alleviate the <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicities,</b> improve the short-term efficacy of radiotherapy, and improve the survival of locally advanced NSCLC patients.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe EORTC/RTOG {{late effects}} {{classification}} {{has been used}} for many years and covers nearly all organs and tissues, which may develop late radiation injuries. Dische developed a scoring system for <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> in which each clinical sign or symptom, that is characteristic for disturbance of function in an irradiated organ, is given scores for severity individually. EORTC and RTOG formed working groups to up-date their systems, for the recording of late injury to normal tissues, to be used in future clinical trials. The resulting system is called LENT-SOMA (1993). AimIn preparation for the introduction of the LENT-SOMA scale into clinical practice at the Centre of Oncology-Institute in Gliwice, we followed a sizeable cohort of patients using two scoring systems for the assessment of delayed <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> at each follow-up examination which took place every 6 months for up to 5 years after curative radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Materials/MethodsThe analysed material comprised of 113 patients with oral cavity, pharyngeal or supraglottic cancer (T 2 - 4 N 0 - 1) irradiated by conventional methods (18 patients), continuous accelerated irradiation (CAIR) (52 patients) or concomitant boost (CB) (43 patients). Total dose was in the range of 66 – 74 Gy. Delayed <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> was evaluated by two classification systems, those of Dische and LENT-SOMA, in the mucosal membranes, skin, larynx, salivary glands and spinal cord every 6 months after completion of radiotherapy treatment. The values in every scale were normalised (as a proportion of the maximum intensity for all symptoms) which permitted statistical comparison of the scales by use of the Wilcoxon test. ResultsAnalysis of all materials indicated a difference in the intensity of late <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> as estimated by the Dische and LENT-SOMA scales. The intensity of delayed <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> in the normalised Dische scale, for mucosal membranes and for skin, had higher values than observed in the LENT-SOMA system for the majority of examined patients. In the case of the larynx and salivary glands, the opposite situation was noted. The extent of conformity between normalised scales was evaluated {{in the case of the}} spinal cord. ConclusionsThe scoring systems of Dische and LENT-SOMA can not be interchangeably used, in clinical practice, for the estimation of delayed <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> in tissues of the head and neck region. The sensitivity of the scoring systems is similar only for the evaluation of radiation reactions in spinal cord...|$|E
40|$|PurposeThe {{estimation}} of scoring system SOMA-LENT in classification the late <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> {{in patients with}} squamous cell cancer irradiated in H&N region. Material and methodsThe material includes 97 patients with oral cavity, pharyngeal and supraglottic cancer T 2 – 4 N 0 – 1 irradited by conventional method (18 patients), continous accelerated irradiation CAIR (42 patients) and concomitant boost CB (37 patients). Total dose was in range 66 – 74 Gy. The late <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> was evaluated by SOMA-LENT system for pharyngeal and oral cavity mucosal membrane, skin, larynx, salivary glands, spinal cord. The estimation was done every 6 months after completing of radiotherapy. In statistical analysis the values were normalisated to maximal intensity of all symptoms in the scale. ResultsThe intensity of late <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> for mucosal membrane was increasing between 12 th– 18 th month after radiotherapy and next decreased from 24 after irradiation. For skin the intensity of late radiation reaction increased to 24 months after treatment. For larynx we noticed two peaks of late radiation toxicity: between 18 th– 24 th month and about 54 month after irradiation. The intensity of late radiation effect for salivary glands increased to 18 month and next diminished to 60 months. For spinal cord there was observed significant progression of intensity late toxicity (mild functional) during second year after irradiation. Conclusions 1.

40|$|Purpose: Moderately hypofractionated {{intensity}} modulated {{radiation therapy}} (HIMRT) {{for prostate cancer}} shortens the treatment course while providing outcomes comparable with those of conventional intensity modulated radiation therapy (CIMRT). To determine the long-term economic value of HIMRT, including the costs of managing long-term <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicities,</b> a cost minimization analysis compared CIMRT with dose-escalated HIMRT using patient-level data from a randomized trial. Methods and materials: Men with localized prostate cancer were randomized to CIMRT (75. 6 [*]Gy in 42 fractions over 8. 4 weeks) or HIMRT (72 [*]Gy in 30 fractions over 6 weeks). A decision tree modeled trial probabilities of maximum late bowel and urinary toxicities using patient-level data with a median follow-up of 6 years. Costs were estimated from the healthcare perspective using the 2014 national reimbursement rates for services received. Patient-level institutional costs, adjusted to 2014 dollars, verified reimbursements. A sensitivity analysis assessed model uncertainty. Results: The cost for HIMRT and toxicity management was $ 22, 957, saving $ 7, 000 compared with CIMRT ($ 30, 241). CIMRT was the common factor among the 5 most influential scenarios that contributed to total costs. Toxicity represented a small part (< 10 %) of the average total cost for patients with either grade 2 - 3 bowel toxicity or grade 2 - 3 urinary toxicity. However, toxicity management reached up to 26 % of the total cost for patients with both high-grade bowel and urinary toxicities. There was no threshold at which CIMRT became the less costly regimen. Institutional costs confirmed the economic value of HIMRT ($ 6, 000 in savings). Conclusions: HIMRT is more cost-efficient than CIMRT for treating prostate cancer, even when {{taking into account the}} costs related to late <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicities.</b> HIMRT enhances the value of prostate radiation when compared with CIMRT...|$|R

Here, we report evidence of prognostic utility in prostate cancer for gamma-H 2 AX foci decay ratios and gene expression profiles derived from ex vivoirradiated patient lymphocytes. Patients were followed >= 2 years after radiotherapy. Clinical characteristics were assembled, and toxicity was recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria (CTCAE) v 4. 0. No clinical factor was correlated with late <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity.</b> The gamma-H 2 AX foci decay ratio correlated negatively with toxicity grade, with {{a significant difference between}} grade >= 3 and grade 0 patients (P = 0. 02). A threshold foci decay ratio, determined in our retrospective study, correctly classified 23 of 28 patients with grade >= 3 toxicity (sensitivity 82 %) and 9 of 14 patients with grade 0 toxicity (specificity 64 %). Induction of homologous recombination (HR) repair genes was reduced with increasing toxicity grade. The difference in fold induction of the HR gene set was most pronounced between grade 0 and grade >= 3 toxicity (P = 0. 008). Notably, reduced responsiveness of HR repair genes to irradiation and inefficient double-strand break repair correlated with severe late <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Using a decay ratio classifier, we correctly classified 82 % of patients with grade >= 3 toxicity, suggesting a prognostic biomarker for cancer patients with a genetically enhanced risk for late <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> to normal tissues after radiotherapy.

In addition, for a matched subset the DNA damage repair kinetics (γ-H 2 AX assay) and expression profiles of DNA repair genes were determined in ex vivo irradiated lymphocytes. Examination of clinical data indicated none of the considered clinical parameters to be correlated with the susceptibility of patients to develop late <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Although frequencies of γ-H 2 AX foci induced immediately after irradiation were similar (P=. 32), significantly higher numbers of γ-H 2 AX foci were found 24 hours after irradiation in OR compared with NR patients (P=. 03). Patient-specific γ-H 2 AX foci decay ratios were significantly higher in NR patients than in OR patients (P <. 0001). Consequently, NR patients seem to repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) more efficiently than OR patients. Moreover, gene expression analysis indicated several genes of the homologous recombination pathway to be stronger induced in NR compared with OR patients (P <. 05). A similar trend was observed in genes of the nonhomologous end-joining repair pathway (P=. 09).

40|$|Inflammatory {{changes are}} a major {{component}} of the normal tissue response to ionizing radiation, and increased nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activity is an important mediator of inflammatory responses. Here, we used zebrafish embryos to assess the capacity of two different classes of pharmacologic agents known to target NF-κB to modify <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> in the vertebrate organism. These were proteasome inhibitors, including lactacystin, MG 132, and PS- 341 (Bortezomib/VELCADE), and direct inhibitors of NF-κB activity, including ethyl pyruvate (EP) and the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO-TFEA (RTA 401), among others. The proteasome inhibitors either did not significantly affect radiation sensitivity of zebrafish embryos (MG 132, lactacystin) or rendered zebrafish embryos more sensitive to the lethal effects of ionizing radiation (PS- 341). Radiosensitization by PS- 341 was reduced in fish with impaired p 53 expression or function but not associated with enhanced expression of select p 53 target genes. In contrast, the direct NF-κB inhibitors EP and CDDO-TFEA significantly improved overall survival of lethally irradiated zebrafish embryos. In addition, direct NF-κB inhibition reduced radiation-induced apoptosis in the central nervous system, abrogated aberrations in body axis development, restored metabolization and secretion of a reporter lipid through the gastrointestinal system, and improved renal clearance compromised by radiation. In contrast to amifostine, EP and CDDO-TFEA not only protected against but also mitigated <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> when given 1 to 2 hours postexposure. Finally, four additional IκB kinase inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action similarly improved overall survival of lethally irradiated zebrafish embryos. In conclusion, inhibitors of canonical pathways to NF-κB activation may be useful in alleviating <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> in patients.

40|$|Abstract Background: The locally {{advanced}} {{head and}} neck cancer with fixed nodes are incurable and has a short survival. This study aims to evaluate the symptom relief, disease response and acute toxicity after palliative hypofractionated radiotherapy. Methods: Between December 2010 to June 2011, previously untreated 50 patients who had histopathologically proved of {{head and neck}} squamous cell carcinoma with fixed node of stage IV, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 2 - 3 were offered palliative radiotherapy (20 Gy/ 5 Fr/ 5 Days). Patients were evaluated at 15 th and 30 th day after completion of treatment for disease response (WHO), palliation of symptoms using symptomatic response grading and acute <b>toxicities</b> (<b>Radiation</b> Therapy Oncology Group, RTOG). Results: The most common presenting complaint was pain followed by dysphagia. Majority of patients (60 - 70 %) had appreciable relief in their presenting symptom. In our study, we observed Partial Response (PR) in majority of patients (92 %); no patient had progressive or stable disease. None of the patients experienced <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicities</b> that required hospital admission. Almost all patients showed grade one and two acute skin and mucosal toxicities one month after completion of treatment. Conclusion: Advanced head and neck cancer with fixed neck node should be identified for suitable palliative hypofractionated radiotherapy to achieve acceptable symptom relief in great proportion of patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} low-dose <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> IBERALL, A. S. The problem of low-dose <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Am. J. Physiol. 244 (Regulatory Integrative Comp. Physiol. 13) : R 7 -R 13, 1983. -This article {{deals with the}} problem of {{distinguishing}} the mortality effects in mammals of exposure to added low-level radiation exposure, from the effects of natural background radiation. In contrast to the recent 1980 conclusions of the Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radia-tions (BEIR III) (that there is no threshold), this article suggests an absolute threshold of about 500 rem (r), if the dose is distributed uniformly over the life span (e. g., at 5 - 10 r/yr for human beings). Although this conclusion had been implied in an earlier study (Ann. NY Acad. Sci. 147 : l- 81, 1964), its validity was strengthened by the work of Raabe et al. (Science 208 : 61 - 66, 1980). They demonstrated that a radiation exposure threshold in dogs was identifiable through the induction of cancers. From a policy point of view, the conclusions of the present article are intended t...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alterations, {{including}} mtDNA {{copy number}} and mtDNA 4977 bp common deletion (CD), are key indicators of irradiation-induced damage. The relationship between {{total body irradiation}} (TBI) treatment and mtDNA alterations in vivo, however, has not been postulated yet. The {{aim of this study}} is to analyze mtDNA alterations in irradiated human peripheral lymphocytes from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients as well as to take them as predictors for <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity.</b> Methods Peripheral blood lymphocytes were isolated from 26 ALL patients 24 hours after TBI preconditioning (4. 5 and 9 Gy, respectively). Extracted DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR method. Results Average 2. 31 times mtDNA and 0. 53 fold CD levels were observed after 4. 5 Gy exposure compared to their basal levels. 9 Gy TBI produced a greater response of both mtDNA and CD levels than 4. 5 Gy. Significant inverse correlation was found between mtDNA content and CD level at 4. 5 and 9 Gy (P = 0. 037 and 0. 048). Moreover, mtDNA content of lymphocytes without irradiation was found to be correlated to age. Conclusions mtDNA and CD content may be considered as predictive factors to <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Radiation is an {{effective}} anti-cancer therapy but leads to severe late <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity</b> in 5 %- 10 % of patients. Assuming that genetic susceptibility impacts this risk, we hypothesized that the cellular response of normal tissue to X-rays could discriminate patients with and without late <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity.</b> METHODS AND FINDINGS: Prostate carcinoma patients without evidence of cancer 2 y after curative radiotherapy were recruited in the study. Blood samples of 21 patients with severe late complications from radiation and 17 patients without symptoms were collected. Stimulated peripheral lymphocytes were mock-irradiated or irradiated with 2 -Gy X-rays. The 24 -h radiation response was analyzed by gene expression profiling and used for classification. Classification was performed either on the expression of separate genes or, to augment the classification power, on gene sets consisting of genes grouped together based on function or cellular colocalization. X-ray irradiation altered the expression of radio-responsive genes in both groups. This response was variable across individuals, and {{the expression of the}} most significant radio-responsive genes was unlinked to <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicity.</b> The classifier based on the radiation response of separate genes correctly classified 63 % of the patients. The classifier based on affected gene sets improved correct classification to 86 %, although on the individual level only 21 / 38 (55 %) patients were classified with high certainty. The majority of the discriminative genes and gene sets belonged to the ubiquitin, apoptosis, and stress signaling networks. The apoptotic response appeared more pronounced in patients that did not develop toxicity. In an independent set of 12 patients, the toxicity status of eight was predicted correctly by the gene set classifier. CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression profiling succeeded to some extent in discriminating groups of patients with and without severe late radiotherapy toxicity. Moreover, the discriminative power was enhanced by assessment of functionally or structurally related gene sets. While prediction of individual response requires improvement, this study is a step forward in predicting susceptibility to late radiation toxicit...|$|E

Much {{of the evidence that}} underlies our understanding of secondary cancer risks and our risk estimates are derived from large epidemiologic studies and predictive models of earlier decades with large uncertainties. The modern era is characterized by more conformal radiotherapy technologies, molecular and genetic marker approaches, genome-wide studies and risk stratifications, and sophisticated biologically based predictive models of the carcinogenesis process. Four key areas that have strong evidence toward affecting secondary cancer risks are 1) the patient age at time of radiation treatment, 2) genetic risk factors, 3) the organ and tissue site receiving radiation, and 4) the dose and volume of tissue being irradiated by a particular radiation technology. This review attempts to summarize our current understanding on the impact on secondary cancer risks for each of these known risk factors. We review the recent advances in genetic studies and carcinogenesis models that are providing insight into the biologic processes that occur from tissue irradiation {{to the development of a}} secondary malignancy. Finally, we discuss current approaches toward minimizing the risk of radiation-associated secondary malignancies, an important goal of clinical radiation oncology.

40|$|Skin changes {{caused by}} {{ionizing}} radiation have been scientifically documented since 1902. Ionizing radiation {{is a widely}} accepted form of treatment for various types of cancer. Despite the technological advances, radiation skin injury remains a significant problem. This injury, {{often referred to as}} radiation dermatitis, occurs in about 95 % of patients receiving radiation therapy for cancer, and ranges in severity from mild erythema to moist desquamation and ulceration. Ionizing radiation is not only a concern for cancer patients, but also a public health concern because of the potential for and reality of a nuclear and/or radiological event. Recently, the United States has increased efforts to develop medical countermeasures to protect against <b>radiation</b> <b>toxicities</b> from acts of bioterrorism, as well as cancer treatment. Management of radiation dermatitis would improve the therapeutic benefit of radiation therapy for cancer and potentially the mortality expected in any “dirty bomb” attack. Currently, there is no effective treatment to prevent or mitigate radiation skin injury. This review summarizes “the good, the bad, and the ugly” of current and evolving knowledge regarding mechanisms of and treatments for radiation skin injury...|$|R
