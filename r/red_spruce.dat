25|$|This {{results in}} the boreal forest at higher {{elevations}} on the mountain having a notably higher proportion of paper birch and <b>red</b> <b>spruce</b> to balsam fir compared to Slide and other major Catskill peaks. These pioneering species are often found in areas regenerating themselves (<b>red</b> <b>spruce</b> is also found as an associate to hemlocks at lower elevations near Stony Clove Notch, reflecting the extensive tanbarking there).|$|E
25|$|From {{the base}} to the summit, floral species {{diminish}} with increasingly shallow soil levels. The summit {{is home to}} many different specialized sub-alpine species which can retain moisture {{for long periods of}} time. Alpine and sub-alpine species include mountain ash, cotton grass, sheep laurel, mountain sandwort, and the mountain cranberry. Krummholz, trees stunted by harsh weather, are found on Mount Monadnock, as are several alpine bogs. Lower elevations on Mount Monadnock are clad in northern hardwood forest species; middle elevations support stands of <b>red</b> <b>spruce.</b> Before the fires, Mount Monadnock was totally covered in a <b>red</b> <b>spruce</b> forest. Since the summit has been barren of soil cover, <b>red</b> <b>spruce</b> have been slowly ascending back towards the top in a process known as ecological succession.|$|E

50|$|Sirococcus conigenus causes shoot blight and {{seedling}} {{mortality of}} conifers in North America, Europe, and North Africa. Under its former name, Ascochyta piniperda, twig blight damage to seedlings {{of white and}} <b>red</b> <b>spruces</b> in a nursery near Asheville, North Carolina, were reported by Graves (1914). Hosts include white, black, Engelmann, Norway, and <b>red</b> <b>spruces,</b> although {{they are not the}} plants most commonly damaged. Sirococcus blight of spruces in nurseries show up randomly in seedlings to which the fungus was transmitted in infested seed. First-year seedlings are often killed, and larger plants may become too deformed for planting. Outbreaks involving < 30% of spruce seedlings in seedbeds have been traced to seed lots in which only 0.1% to 3% of seeds were infested. Seed infestation has in turn been traced to the colonization of spruce cones by S. conigenus in forests of the western interior. Infection develops readily if conidia are deposited on succulent plant parts that remain wet for at least 24 hours at 10 °C to 25 °C. Longer periods of wetness favour increasingly severe disease. Twig tips killed during growth the previous year shows a characteristic crook.|$|R
25|$|<b>Red</b> <b>Spruce</b> Trail {{is about}} one mile (1.6km) long and goes from the camping area to the Forty Maples Picnic Area. It passes through a spruce {{plantation}} and a mixed hardwood forest. Hikers should be cautious of the venomous snakes {{that live in the}} area.|$|E
25|$|Air {{pollution}} is contributing to increased <b>Red</b> <b>Spruce</b> tree mortality at higher elevations and oak decline at lower elevations, while invasive hemlock woolly adelgids attack Hemlocks and balsam woolly adelgids attack Fraser Firs. Pseudoscymnus tsugae, {{a type of}} beetle in the ladybug family, Coccinellidae, has been introduced {{in an attempt to}} control the pests.|$|E
25|$|Nearly 60 {{percent of}} the park is covered with {{northern}} hardwood forest. Above 2600 feet (790 m) conditions are too poor for hardwoods to thrive, and these trees become mixed with or replaced by balsam fir and <b>red</b> <b>spruce.</b> Above 3500 feet (1000 m) black spruce replace red. Higher still only trees short enough to be covered in snow during the winter can survive.|$|E

30|$|Based {{on their}} {{frequency}} and occurrence, this analysis {{focused on the}} top eight hardwoods (American beech, ash, black cherry, quaking aspen, red maple, red oak, sugar maple, yellow birch) and top six softwoods (balsam fir, eastern hemlock, <b>red</b> pine, <b>spruce,</b> white cedar, white pine). The other species present were grouped into either “other hardwoods” (OH) or “other softwoods” (OS).|$|R
25|$|The {{tower is}} {{located near the}} center of the small {{clearing}} left by early 20th-century logging operations. It is surrounded on all sides by tall balsam fir and <b>red</b> <b>spruce,</b> the dominant tree species in the boreal forest found at high elevations in the Catskills. The observer's cabin, with a small protected porch, is just to the southeast. Its windows are covered in steel mesh to protect it from porcupines, abundant in the Catskill forests, which chew on the wood.|$|E
25|$|Other {{plants can}} also be damaged by acid rain, but the effect on food crops is {{minimized}} by the application of lime and fertilizers to replace lost nutrients. In cultivated areas, limestone may also be added to increase {{the ability of the}} soil to keep the pH stable, but this tactic is largely unusable in the case of wilderness lands. When calcium is leached from the needles of <b>red</b> <b>spruce,</b> these trees become less cold tolerant and exhibit winter injury and even death.|$|E
25|$|Canaan Valley and {{surrounding}} areas were strongly {{impacted by the}} southward advance of glaciers some 15,000 years ago. Although the glaciers themselves did not extend into the area, this climatic change resulted in a very cool, moist environment that was forest-unfriendly. Later, as the ice receded, many cold-adapted plant species remained behind and survived due to the high elevation. Soon, however, this tundra-like vegetation was largely crowded out by the growth of an extraordinarily dense climax <b>red</b> <b>spruce</b> forest, intermixed with balsam fir and hardwoods.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning at the California/Oregon border, and {{extending}} through {{the north end}} of Vancouver Island is the [...] "seasonal rain forest zone". The major tree species here are Douglas fir, western <b>red</b> cedar, Sitka <b>spruce,</b> and western hemlock.|$|R
5000|$|Beyond the {{northern}} end of Vancouver Island, is the [...] "perhumid rain forest zone". Douglas fir wanes as a dominant species, and the forest is primarily made up of western <b>red</b> cedar, Sitka <b>spruce,</b> and western hemlock.|$|R
50|$|The Olympic {{rainforest}} of Washington supports dense {{stands of}} western hemlock, western <b>red</b> cedar, Sitka <b>spruce,</b> and Pacific silver and grand firs.

25|$|White spruce is an {{associated}} {{species in the}} following Eastern Forest cover types, by the Society of American Foresters: In the Boreal Forest Region: (1) jack pine, (5) balsam fir, (12) black spruce, (16) aspen, (18) paper birch, and (38) tamarack. In the Northern Forest Region: (15) red pine, (21) eastern white pine, (24) hemlock-yellow birch, (25) sugar maple-beech-yellow birch, (27) sugar maple, (30) red spruce-yellow birch, (32) <b>red</b> <b>spruce,</b> (33) red spruce-balsam fir, (37) northern white-cedar, and (39) black ash-American elm-red maple (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990, Eyre 1980).|$|E
25|$|The High Alleghenies {{are noted}} for their forests of <b>red</b> <b>spruce,</b> balsam fir, and {{mountain}} ash, trees typically found much farther north. Hardwood forests also include yellow birch, sugar and red maple, eastern hemlock, and black cherry. American beech, pine and hickory {{can also be}} found. The forests of the entire region are now almost all second- or third-growth forests, the original trees having been removed in the late 19th and (in West Virginia) early 20th centuries. The wild onion known as the ramp (Allium tricoccum) is also present in the deeper forests.|$|E
25|$|Much {{pulpwood}} {{and timber}} has been harvested {{from the community}} especially since the Mersey Pulp Mill was built in 1929 in Liverpool, Nova Scotia (Bowater, 2007). <b>Red</b> <b>Spruce,</b> Black Spruce and Balsam Fir {{are the most common}} species harvested after it matures in approximately 30 to 40 years. In most cases, the shallow layers of topsoil and grey clay layers beneath the forest do not support a tree's long term growth or promote good drainage in the local area. The community is rich in shale which when blasted and crushed provides various grades of road and building materials.|$|E
50|$|The town {{started with}} 15 houses. The Canadian Northern Railway built a large sawmill, {{west of the}} station, {{equipped}} with a pulp barker, planing mill, and a powerhouse. This mill, although owned by the railway, operated under the name Eastern Lands Division. Lumber was sold wholesale to railway employees, for home construction. A lumber yard was also established at Capreol. The Eastern Lands Co. built their main office here. They cut white pine, <b>red</b> pine, <b>spruce</b> pulp logs, and jack pine axe ties.|$|R

50|$|Vegetation in {{the area}} is divided into several sections. Near the Lake Mendota Drive {{entrance}} there is a heavy population of <b>red</b> pine, <b>spruce,</b> white pine, <b>red</b> cedar and catalpa trees. Species in the southern portion of the point include silver maple, hackberry, green ash, box elder, and cottonwood trees. Several hardwood trees round out holes in the forest, including sugar maple, hackberry, basswood, and black cherry, along with red elderberry shrubs. The area has issues with invasive non-native vegetation, such as buckthorn, honeysuckle, and Norway maples.|$|R
25|$|The {{southern}} {{limit of}} distribution of white spruce is more complex. From {{east of the}} main range of coastal mountains in British Columbia, the southern continuous limit of white spruce is the forest/prairie interface through Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, the northern parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, central Michigan, northeastern New York, and Maine (Fowells 1965). Sargent (1922) and Harlow and Harrar (1950) also included Vermont and New Hampshire; and, while Dame and Brooks (1901) excluded New York and states further west, they included Massachusetts {{as far south as}} Amherst and Northampton, “probably the southern limit of the species” in that area. Nisbet (1905) gave the range of white spruce as extending to “Carolina”, but he did not recognize <b>red</b> <b>spruce</b> as a species and presumably included it with white spruce.|$|E
25|$|Fernow's {{plan called}} for clearcutting the tract {{at the rate of}} several {{thousand}} acres per year to prepare for planting conifers. With an annual state appropriation for the college of only $10,000, Cornell entered into a contract with the Brookyn Cooperage Company for the project to be viable. Under terms of the contract, the firm was to take the logs and cordwood from the forest land for a 15-year period. (In the 1890s, the more valuable <b>red</b> <b>spruce</b> trees had been logged, leaving primarily northern hardwoods.) Fernow had a -long railroad spur built from Axton to Tupper Lake in order to deliver logs to the company's facility. The firm turned the hardwood logs into barrels and the cordwood into methanol and charcoal, through a process called destructive distillation.|$|E
25|$|The {{trail is}} located in Hope, New York, 5 {{and a half miles}} South of Wells, NY. It is a 1.8 mile trail, {{including}} 3 waterfalls each ranging between 10 and 30 feet tall. The trail was originally a major logging road that ran to Devorse creek, but the road was abandoned and later the first 2 miles of it began seeing use as a hiking trail. Part of the old road runs along a steep gorge, where loggers had to build a flying trestle to allow horses to pull logs from nearby camps. Groff mountain has a large population of eastern hemlock and <b>red</b> <b>spruce.</b> Historically, these attracted tanners from nearby towns. Because of the dense forestation, the area is largely shaded, and so often maintains snow throughout the winter. The trail sees use from hikers during the spring and summer, and snowshoers in winter. There is a small parking area for the trail at the end of River road.|$|E
25|$|At {{the base}} and around the {{perimeter}} of the Chief are thick forests. Although not exactly old growth these stands of trees are representative of pacific coastal temperate rain forest common in the area.

60|$|Rambling {{about the}} woods at this camp, I noticed that they {{consisted}} chiefly of firs, <b>spruce,</b> <b>red</b> maple, birch, and, along the river, the hoary alder. I could trace {{the outlines of}} large birches that had fallen long ago, collapsed and rotted and turned to soil, by faint yellowish-green lines of featherlike moss, eighteen inches wide and twenty or thirty feet long, crossed by other similar lines.|$|R
25|$|On dry, deep, outwash {{deposits}} in northern Ontario, both white spruce and aspen grow slowly (MacLean 1960). But, broadly, white spruce {{is able to}} tolerate considerable droughtiness of sites that are fertile, and no fertile site is too moist unless soil moisture is stagnant (Sutton 1968). Soil fertility holds the key not just to white spruce growth but to {{the distribution of the}} species. At least moderate fertility is needed for good growth, but white spruce occurs on many sites where nutrient deficiencies depress its growth more than that of black spruce, <b>red</b> <b>spruce,</b> Norway spruce, and the pines generally (Heiberg and White 1951, Lafond 1954, McLeod 1956, MacArthur 1957, Paine 1960, Swan 1960). Minimum soil-fertility standards recommended for white spruce sufficient to produce 126 to 157nbsp&m3/ha of wood at 40 years are much higher than for pine species commonly planted in the Lake States (Wilde 1966): 3.5% organic matter, 12.0 meq/100 g exchange capacity, 0.12% total N, 44.8nbsp&kg/ha available P, 145.7nbsp&kg/ha available K, 3.00 meq/100 g exchangeable Ca, and 0.70 meq/100 g exchangeable Mg.|$|E
500|$|As {{elevation}} increases, {{the forest}} is subjected to colder temperatures, increased moisture, and acidic, infertile soils. As a result, conifers, or [...] "softwoods" [...] become the dominant species. Two trees, <b>red</b> <b>spruce</b> and balsam fir, are present throughout this zone, with paper birch, striped maple and mountain ash present in its lower levels. Like the hardwood forest below it, the spruce-fir forest also holds understory plants; commonly found are wood sorrel, Indian pipes, Canada mayflowers, and bluebead lilies. Fungi are also common in the moist environment.|$|E

50|$|The Pacific Crest Trail {{runs through}} the {{wilderness}} for 32 mi. The Marble Mountain Wilderness features an unparalleled diversity of plant life found nowhere else in the state. More species of conifers (17) live in proximity here than any place else in the world. These trees include the Brewer's spruce, incense cedar, Western Juniper; white, subalpine, and Shasta <b>red</b> fir; Engelmann <b>spruce,</b> mountain hemlock, Pacific yew; and whitebark, knobcone, foxtail, lodgepole, sugar, ponderosa, and Western white pine.|$|R
50|$|Vegetation in {{the park}} is typical for the region's forests with Douglas-fir most prominent. Common {{associates}} include Western hemlock, Sitka <b>spruce,</b> <b>red</b> alder and bigleaf maple. Salal is the most abundant shrub. Most of the park's soils were mapped as well-drained gravelly loamy sands or sandy loams and classified as brown podzolic in a soil survey published in 1959; however, the abundance of bleached sand grains on forest trails is evidence of an albic horizon characteristic of podzols.|$|R
