40|$|SYNOPSIS Radiotherapy has an {{established}} {{place in the}} treatment of some tumours in children, both for cure and palliation. An evaluation of this form of treatment is made, based on experience with the children admitted to the Christie Hospital and Holt Radium Institute during the past 30 years. To-day radiotherapy is accepted as one of the major weapons against malignant disease, but for most radiotherapists the experience which can be gained in treating tumours in children is limited by the fact that children form a very small part of normal <b>radiotherapeutic</b> <b>practice.</b> In addition the tumours which occur in children are quite different from those seen in adults, a fact illustrated in Table I, which gives the relative incidence of the tumours in children and adults in a year's practice in a radio-therapy centre. These two facts make it impossible and also undesirable for the radiotherapist to base the treatment of children purely on experience with adults...|$|E
40|$|A new thin-target method (patent pending) is {{described}} for portal imaging with low-energy (tens of keV) photons {{from a medical}} linear accelerator operating in a special mode. Low-energy photons are usually produced in the accelerator target, but are absorbed by the target and flattening filter, both made of medium- or high- Z materials such as Cu or W. Since the main contributor to absorption of the low-energy photons is self-absorption by the thick target through the photoelectric effect, it is proposed to lower {{the thickness of the}} portal imaging target to the minimum required to get the maximum low-energy photon fluence on the exit side of the target, and to lower the atomic number of the target so that predominantly photoelectric absorption is reduced. To determine the minimum thickness of the target, EGS 4 Monte Carlo calculations were performed. As a result of these calculations, it was concluded that the maximum photon fluence for a 4 MeV electron beam is obtained with a 1. 5 mm Cu target. This value is approximately five times less than the thickness of the Cu target routinely used for bremsstrahlung production in <b>radiotherapeutic</b> <b>practice.</b> Two sets of experiments were performed: the first with a 1. 5 mm Cu target and the second with a 5 mm Al target (Cu mass equivalent) installed in the linear accelerator. Portal films were taken with a Rando anthropomorphic phantom. To emphasize the low-energy response of the new thin target we used a Kodak Min-R mammographic film and cassette combination, with a strong low-energy response. Because of its high sensitivity, only 1 cGy is required. The new portal images show a remarkable improvement in sharpness and contrast in anatomical detail compared with existing ones. It is also shown that further lowering of the target's atomic number (for example to C or Be) produces no significant improvement...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To detect volume {{effects and}} {{possible}} regional differences in radiosensitivity {{of the rat}} parotid gland. Methods and Materials: Parotid glands of male albino Wistar rats were locally X-irradiated, with collimators with conformal radiation portals used to supply 100 % volume and 50 % cranial/caudal partial volumes. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging was used to provide {{the outlines of the}} parotid glands. Single doses of up to 40 Gy were applied, and the effects on saliva secretion, measured with the aid of miniaturized Lashley cups, were followed up to 365 days after the irradiation. Results: Under conditions of equal mean absorbed doses and small variations in dose distribution, a pertinent volume effect was observed for late but not for early radiation damage. The late effects were different for the cranial part as compared with the caudal part of the parotid gland. The reduction in flow rate was much more severe after irradiation in the cranial part. After a single dose of 30 Gy, the reductions in flow rates were approximately 65 % and 25 % for the cranial and caudal parts, respectively. At that dose, no saliva flow was observed after irradiation of 100 % of the gland. Conclusion: From the rat model studies presented, it is concluded that late radiation damage after partial irradiation of parotid glands shows region-dependent volume effects. This finding is expected to be relevant to the radiosensitivity of human salivary glands, and it implies that the predictive power of the mean dose concept in <b>radiotherapeutic</b> <b>practice</b> is limited. The finding of region-dependent late radiation damage also challenges the basic assumptions of most current normal tissue complication probability models for parotid gland function.

40|$|In a {{large number}} of {{epidemiological}} studies investigating relationship between diet and cancer, a protective effect of the consumption of vegetables and fruits on various types of cancer has been found. This protective effect has been generally attributed to the antioxidative capacities of the constituents present in these foods. The search for natural agents that protect against tumorigenesis is important to those at risk by virtue of environmental pollution or health-related treatment as well as for scientific study of the mechanism of the potential therapeutic application of these agents. The present research is a trial to evaluate the chemopreventive effect of oral administration of oil extracted from the leaves of Coriandrum sativum (1 mg/kg) in mice inoculated with Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma with or without exposure to fractionated doses of gamma irradiation (up to 6 Gy). Significant increase in malondialdehye (MDA) level accompanied with significant decrease in catalase activity in both liver and tumor tissue in the group of mice, bearing tumor while total protein content was increased in tumor tissue. Serum iron was inversely proportional to the level of transferrin and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) levels. Application of coriander oil to mice bearing tumor caused partial amelioration in the assayed parameters. Such amelioration was pronounced in restoring the level of MDA in liver to the control level while, tumor tissue still suffered from sharp increase in MDA content. Combined treatment of coriander oil followed by irradiation exerted a protective effect on the elevation of MDA content induced by tumor growth in both liver and tumor tissue. Successful application of coriander oil in <b>radiotherapeutic</b> <b>practices</b> still awaits further investigation on the optimal to be used in clinical trial and whether or not it will be with value when used with fractionated radiotherapy...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} ten years, {{radiosurgery}} has moved from an obscure radiation treatment modality practiced {{in only a few}} specialized centers in the world, to a mainstream <b>radiotherapeutic</b> technique <b>practiced</b> in most major radiotherapy centers. Currently, the main thrust of development in radiosurgery is aimed at conformal dose delivery to irregular intracranial targets. This thesis deals with theoretical and practical aspects of the use of static, non-coplanar, conformal fields in radiosurgery. For a typical radiosurgical case involving an irregular target, a comparison was made between treatment plans using the dynamic technique with one and two isocenters and a treatment plan using 7 fixed, non-coplanar, irregularly shaped beams. The static conformal fields plan achieved a target-dose conformation similar to the 2 -isocenter dynamic plan, treating 2 to 3 times less healthy tissue to intermediate and high doses that did the 1 -isocenter dynamic plan, while delivering a much more uniform dose to the target volume. A comparison was also made between treatment plans using a varying number of static conformal fields. While the degree of tissue sparing and target-dose homogeneity were both shown to increase with the number of static fields, this increase was found to become smaller and smaller as the number of fields was successively raised from 5 to 7, from 7 to 9 and, ultimately, from 9 to 11. A conclusion is reached that a number of fields between 7 and 9 represents a reasonable compromise between the degree of tissue sparing and target-dose homogeneity achieved, and the ease with which the radiosurgical procedure is planned and delivered...|$|R
40|$|Silicon diodes {{compared}} to other types of dosimeters have several attractive properties, such as an excellent spatial resolution, a high sensitivity, and clinically practical to use. These properties make silicon diodes a preferred dosimeter for relative dosimetry for several types of measurements in small field dosimetry, e. g., stereotactic treatments and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Silicon diodes are, however, limited by an energy dependent response variation in photon beams, resulting in that the diode readout per dose to the phantom medium varies with photon spectral changes, thereby introducing a significant uncertainty in the measured data. The traditional solution for the energy dependent over-response caused by low-energy photons is to use diodes with a shielding filter of high atomic number. These shielded diodes, however, show an incorrect readout for small fields due to electrons scattered from the shielding (Griessbach et al. 2005). In regions with degraded lateral electron equilibrium (LEE) shielded diodes over-respond due to an increased degree of LEE, {{as a consequence of}} the high density shielding (Lee et al. 2002). In this work a prototype software that corrects for the energy dependent response of a silicon diode is developed and validated for small field sizes. The developed software is based on the novel concept of Monte Carlo (MC) simulated fluence pencil beam kernels to calculate spectra (Eklund and Ahnesjö 2008), and the spectra based silicon diode response model proposed by Eklund and Ahnesjö (2009). The software was also extended to include correction of ionization chambers, for the energy dependent Spencer-Attix water/air stopping power ratio (sw,air). The calculated sw,air are shown to be in excellent agreement with published values to better than 0. 1 % for most values, the maximum deviation being 0. 3 %. Measured relative depth doses, relative profiles, and output factors in water, for small square field sizes, for 6 MV and 15 MV clinical photon beams are presented in this work. The results show that the unshielded Scanditronix-Wellhöfer EFD 3 G silicon diode response, corrected by the developed software, is in excellent agreement with reference ionization chamber measurements (corrected for change in sw,air), the maximum deviation being 0. 4 %. Measurements with two types of shielded diodes, namely Scanditronix-Wellhöfer PFD silicon diodes (FP 1990 and FP 2730), are also included in this work. The shielded diodes are shown to have an over-response as large as 2 - 3. 5 % for field sizes smaller than  5 cm x 5 cm. The presented results also suggest a difference in accuracy as large as 0. 5 - 1 % between the two types of shielded diodes, where the spectral composition at the measurement position dictates which type of diode is more accurate. The fast correction of silicon diodes provided by the developed software is more accurate than shielded diodes for small field sizes, and can in <b>radiotherapeutic</b> clinical <b>practice</b> increase the dosimetric accuracy of silicon diodes...|$|R
