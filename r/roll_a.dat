5|$|Most of the {{vehicles}} used in the film were rented, and therefore {{were not allowed to}} be damaged. Only two cars were damaged; one was driven off a bridge, although it was only intended to <b>roll</b> <b>a</b> short distance, and the Jeep filled with webbing needed $3,000 of repairs after solvent in the webbing damaged the interior.|$|E

Swords and daggers were personal possessions and not listed in the inventories, but the remains of both {{have been found in}} great quantities, including the earliest dated example of a British basket-hilted sword.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{turbulent}} political, social and musical {{changes of the}} 1960s and early 1970s, rock music diversified. What was formerly known as rock and <b>roll,</b> <b>a</b> reasonably discrete style of music, had evolved into a catchall category called simply rock music, an umbrella term which would eventually include diverse styles like heavy metal music, punk rock and, sometimes even hip hop music. During the 1970s, however, most of these styles {{were not part of}} mainstream music, and were evolving in the underground music scene.|$|E

5000|$|Here is {{a sample}} game of dice chess. White rolls doubles, {{allowing}} her to play any move, and selects 1.e4.

Black <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> four and a five; since no queen move is possible, he must play the only legal rook move, 2...Rb8. White <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> three and a six, and plays 3.Bxf7+. Black <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> two and a four; since no knight or rook move is a legal response to the check, he must pass. (Only a six, or doubles, would have allowed him to move.) White <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> two and a four, and chooses 4.Nh3. (A three or five would have enabled an immediate win with 4.Bxe8, 4.Qf3# or 4.Qh5#).

5|$|However, it {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that single-story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile homes are less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or <b>roll</b> <b>a</b> mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E
5|$|Hubert Walter (– 13 July 1205) was an {{influential}} royal adviser {{in the late}} twelfth and early thirteenth centuries in the positions of Chief Justiciar of England, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Lord Chancellor. As chancellor, Walter began the keeping of the Charter <b>Roll,</b> <b>a</b> record of all charters issued by the chancery. Walter was not noted for his holiness in life or learning, but historians have judged {{him one of the}} most outstanding government ministers in English history.|$|E
5|$|Kraken Unleashed (named for {{the fictional}} sea monster {{of the same}} name) is a steel floorless roller coaster located at SeaWorld Orlando in the United States. Manufactured by Bolliger & Mabillard, the ride {{features}} a total of seven inversions including two vertical loops, a dive loop, a spiraling camelback (zero-g <b>roll),</b> <b>a</b> cobra roll and a flat spin Kraken opened on June 1, 2000. It is also the world's second longest floorless coaster elongating up to 4,177 feet (1,273 m). The coaster was refurbished and renamed to Kraken Unleashed. The refurbishment included Virtual Reality.|$|E
50|$|The {{counter to}} a break is often <b>a</b> {{displacement}} <b>roll</b> called <b>a</b> barrel <b>roll</b> attack. <b>A</b> barrel <b>roll</b> consists of performing <b>a</b> <b>roll</b> and <b>a</b> loop, completing {{both at the same}} time. The result is <b>a</b> helical <b>roll</b> around <b>a</b> straight flight path. The barrel <b>roll</b> attack uses <b>a</b> much tighter loop than the <b>roll,</b> completing <b>a</b> full loop while only executing 3/4 of <b>a</b> <b>roll.</b> The result is a virtual 90 degree turn, using all three dimensions, in the direction opposite of the roll. Rolling away from the defender's break, the attacker completes the roll with the aircraft's nose pointed {{in the direction of the}} defender's travel.|$|R

In fact, it has the even stronger property that, for each die in the set, there is another die that <b>rolls</b> <b>a</b> higher number than it {{more than half the}} time.|$|R

5|$|Raptor is a steel {{inverted}} {{roller coaster}} designed by Bolliger & Mabillard at Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, United States. When built in 1994, it broke many records and held many firsts when it opened. Instead {{of having a}} short layout designed {{to fit into a}} compact area like , Raptor was designed with a larger, 3,790-foot (1,160m) layout, making it the tallest, fastest and longest inverted roller coaster in the world when it opened. It features six inversions, including a cobra <b>roll,</b> <b>a</b> first for inverted roller coasters. At its opening, it was the largest investment in Cedar Point history. The ride is themed as a bird of prey.|$|E

The boy returns {{to each of the}} worlds to collect Ruffleberg's companions, taking them back to the real world. In doing so, Evermore's {{destruction}} is averted and it continues to exist without them. After the credits <b>roll,</b> <b>a</b> final scene shows Professor Ruffleberg returning Carltron to his old task of cleaning the lab. Carltron grins and rubs his hands together, implying that he is not as docile as the professor believes.|$|E
5|$|The Prague Spring is {{featured}} in several works of literature. Milan Kundera set his novel The Unbearable Lightness of Being during the Prague Spring. It follows {{the repercussions of}} increased Soviet presence and the dictatorial police control of the population. A film version was released in 1988. The Liberators, by Viktor Suvorov, is an eyewitness description of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, {{from the point of}} view of a Soviet tank commander. Rock 'n' <b>Roll,</b> <b>a</b> play by award-winning Czech-born English playwright Tom Stoppard, references the Prague Spring, as well as the 1989 Velvet Revolution. Heda Margolius Kovály also ends her memoir Under a Cruel Star with a first hand account of the Prague Spring and the subsequent invasion, and her reflections upon these events.|$|E

5|$|The film {{begins with}} a baby taking his first steps on a beach {{supported}} by his father. The narrator (Murali Mohan) states that, it is right for a father to support his child in his infancy, but questions whether the father should continue to hold the child's hand even after he is 24 years old. As the credits <b>roll,</b> <b>a</b> visibly angry Siddharth 'Siddhu' Addala (Siddharth) begins verbally abusing all the fathers in the world. When queried about his disgust, he says that his father, Aravind (Prakash Raj), gives him more than what he asks for. He cites instances where his choices of dressing, hairstyle, and many others are overruled by his father's. However, he vows that his career and the woman he marries will be his own choice.|$|E

25|$|Still Life {{springs from}} a {{meditation}} upon {{the myth of}} Sisyphus, who was sentenced to a weird kind of immortality: he would <b>roll</b> <b>a</b> huge rock {{up to the top}} of a mountain, only for the rock to roll back down. He would then walk down in order to roll the rock up again. Over and over, eternally. Sisyphus is like a working class hero.|$|E

25|$|However, chance plays a {{large role}} in Button Men; it is always {{possible}} for a 20-sided die to <b>roll</b> <b>a</b> 1 at an inopportune time. Among tournament legal buttons, at least, no match-up is impossible for either side to win. Inevitably it happens that a weaker Button Man or a less skilled player will claim some improbable victories due to lucky die rolls. This effect is offset somewhat, however, by the rule that a player must win three rounds to win a game.|$|E

Parker, not one to forget harsh criticism, stated that the fee would be $125,000 for two songs, a total of eight minutes on screen; Sinatra himself was receiving a lower sum for the whole show, but he agreed. The show, entitled “Welcome Home, Elvis”, was Presley's first national television appearance since The Ed Sullivan Show in January 1957.|$|E

This led to the airing of the popular rock and roll dance show American Bandstand, from Philadelphia, hosted by twenty-something Dick Clark from the Channel 6 studios at 46th and Market Streets at the time, where teenagers would descend in droves after school to be televised dancing to the latest hits on the pop charts in front of a national audience.|$|E
