5|$|As Naiad, Triton and Alcmene {{streamed}} past {{in pursuit}} of Santa Brigida, Young focused his attention on Thetis, coming within range at 11:30. Mendoza, seeing that battle was inevitable, bore up across Ethalions bows {{in an effort to}} rake Young's ship. Young turned in order to thwart the manoeuvre and fired two rapid broadsides into Thetis, which <b>responded</b> <b>in</b> kind. For an hour the frigates exchanged running fire until Mendoza, realising escape was impossible, surrendered. Thetis had lost one man killed and nine wounded in the exchange while Ethalion had suffered no casualties.|$|E

On the night of 17–18 September, Bulgarian positions were targeted by nine salvos of gas shells, however the attack failed to produce any considerable effect due to the preceding arrival of new gas masks and the adequate training of the defenders.|$|E

This action nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines dispatched a squadron of warships to the Santa Cruz River.

40|$|Although {{problems}} with emotional functioning are considered central to borderline personality disorder (BPD), {{it is only}} recently that studies have begun utilizing laboratory biobehavioral measures (including neuroimaging and psychophysiological measures) to examine emotional <b>responding</b> <b>in</b> BPD.

5|$|After a short halt {{to leave}} their baggage train behind and form a battle line the Persian army quickly {{advanced}} on the Byzantines, shooting arrows as they approached. The Byzantines <b>responded</b> <b>in</b> kind and then sallied forth to meet the oncoming enemy. On the Byzantine right Vitalius was quickly victorious, his heavy cavalry breaking through the Persian flank and pushing his opponents to the left behind their own main line. At this point, however, disaster threatened as many of Vitalius' troopers broke formation and headed towards the enemy camp, intending to loot it. Philippicus, however, saw {{what had happened and}} reacted quickly. He gave his distinctive helmet to one of his bodyguards, Theodore Ilibinus, and sent him to rally the cavalry on pain of punishment by the army commander himself. The ruse worked: the men recognized the helmet and returned to order just in time to stop the Persians, who had regrouped in the centre and were pushing the numerically inferior Byzantines back.|$|E

It was the same flag Ellsworth had seen for weeks from the White House during his visits with Lincoln. Ellsworth's group entered the inn and quickly cut down the flag, but they encountered the proprietor, James Jackson, as they descended the stairs. Jackson killed Ellsworth with a shotgun blast to the chest, and Cpl. Francis Brownell <b>responded</b> <b>in</b> kind by fatally shooting the innkeeper.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick {{transfer}} of power. The Social Credit victory had provoked a bank run, {{and he wanted}} to re-establish stability as quickly as possible. Moreover, the province needed to borrow a large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a lame duck government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, confronted with a dire financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement. Reid <b>responded</b> <b>in</b> January 1936 that there had been no such mismanagement, that the province's financial problems were due to Social Credit's policies, both real and promised, and that had the UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it had been too restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.|$|E

5|$|After {{the second}} study {{resulted}} in no further movement toward divided highway construction, locals formed the County Residents Action for Safer Highways (CRASH) in response to the significantly higher collision rates along the two-lane sections of US113 compared to the state average. The high collision rate, which included 42 fatal crashes between 1980 and 1997, led CRASH to rally community support and intensely lobby MDSHA to expand US113 to four lanes. MDSHA <b>responded</b> <b>in</b> 1995 by initiating the US113 Planning Study, which recommended expanding US113 to a divided highway from Berlin to the Delaware state line and from Snow Hill to Berlin. The agency needed to persuade other involved agencies to make the proposed expansion their top priority, because at the time traffic volumes on the highway did not meet the thresholds beyond which the highway would need to be expanded to a four-lane divided highway.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1991 Croatia had no regular army, and {{in an effort to}} bolster its defence the country doubled its police force to about 20,000. The force's most effective component was its 3,000-strong special police, deployed in 12 battalions with a military structure. There were also a 9,000–10,000-strong regionally-organized reserve police, grouped into 16 battalions and 10 companies. The reserve police carried only small arms, and a portion of the force was unarmed. Although the Croatian government <b>responded</b> <b>in</b> May by forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde – ZNG), its development was hampered by a United Nations arms embargo introduced in September. On 12 September the ZNG was ordered to blockade all JNA facilities it could reach, beginning the Battle of the Barracks.|$|E
5|$|Behind Royal Sovereign was Marlborough, {{inextricably}} {{tangled with}} Impétueux. Badly damaged {{and on the}} verge of surrender, Impétueux was briefly reprieved when Mucius appeared through the smoke and collided with both ships. The three entangled ships continued exchanging fire for some time, all suffering heavy casualties with Marlborough and Impétueux losing all three of their masts. This combat continued for several hours. Captain Berkeley of Marlborough had to retire below with serious wounds, and command fell to Lieutenant John Monkton, who signalled for help from the frigates in reserve. Robert Stopford <b>responded</b> <b>in</b> HMS Aquilon, which had the assignment of repeating signals, and towed Marlborough out of the line as Mucius freed herself and made for the regrouped French fleet to the north. Impétueux was in too damaged a state to move at all, and was soon seized by sailors from HMS Russell.|$|E

5|$|In 1150, {{it looked}} like Caithness and the whole earldom of Orkney {{were going to come}} under {{permanent}} Scottish control. However, David's plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King Eystein II of Norway put a spanner in the works by sailing through the waterways of Orkney with a large fleet and catching the young Harald unaware in his residence at Thurso. Eystein forced Harald to pay fealty as a condition of his release. Later in the year David hastily responded by supporting the claims to the Orkney earldom of Harald's rival Erlend Haraldsson, granting him half of Caithness in opposition to Harald. King Eystein <b>responded</b> <b>in</b> turn by making a similar grant to this same Erlend, cancelling the effect of David's grant. David's weakness in Orkney was that the Norwegian kings were not prepared to stand back and let him reduce their power.|$|E

This campaign was the only offensive action by the Ionians, who subsequently went on the defensive. The Persians <b>responded</b> <b>in</b> 497 BC with a three pronged attack aimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellion, but {{the spread of the}} revolt to Caria meant that the largest army, under Daurises, relocated there. While initially campaigning successfully in Caria, this army was annihilated in an ambush at the Battle of Pedasus. This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of 496 BC and 495 BC.|$|E
