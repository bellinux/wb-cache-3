Markey's letter, based on an analysis conducted by the Energy and Environment Subcommittee staff, further showed that by comparing the amounts BP reported using to Congress to the amounts contained in the company's <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>exemptions</b> from the ban on surface dispersants it submitted to the USCG, that BP often exceeded its own requests, with little indication that it informed the USCG, or that the USCG attempted to verify whether BP was exceeding approved volumes.

5000|$|The {{predecessor}} of IRC 501(c)(6) {{was enacted}} {{as part of}} the Revenue Act of 1913 likely due to a U.S. Chamber of Commerce <b>request</b> <b>for</b> an <b>exemption</b> <b>for</b> nonprofit [...] "civic" [...] and [...] "commercial" [...] organizations, which resulted in IRC 501(c)(4) for nonprofit [...] "civic" [...] organizations and IRC 501(c)(6) for nonprofit [...] "commercially-oriented" [...] organizations.

5000|$|In 2008, Quebec's Ministry of Education, Sport and Leisure {{introduced}} a mandatory [...] "Ethics and Religious Culture" [...] (ERC) course to all Quebec schools.

Loyola's equivalency course had similar goals as the government's ERC but was structured on a methodology that was more in keeping with its Catholic, Jesuit identity. The government denied the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>exemption</b> and, as a result, Loyola took the matter to the Superior Court of Quebec where in 2010 the Superior court ruled in Loyola's favour. The Ministry appealed and in 2012 the appellate court overturned the Superior court's decision. Loyola then took {{the case to the}} Supreme Court of Canada where, on March 19, 2015, it was ruled that the Quebec Ministry was in violation of Loyola's religious freedom and ordered the Ministry to reconsider the exemption.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2013 Judge Bonadio {{began to}} try Jaime {{on charges of}} fraud {{involving}} contracts for railway improvements. On July 12, Bonadio declared Jaime to be in contempt of court, and ordered that Jaime be arrested and placed in preventive detention. He justified the order by noting that Jaime was the defendant {{in at least a}} dozen criminal cases. At the time Jaime was officially living at Villa Carlos Paz, Omahuacas 91, Barrio Costa Azul. Jaime did not submit himself for arrest, and instead went into hiding. Attempts to locate him, including raids on several of his residences in Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and elsewhere, were unsuccessful. Jaime’s lawyer, Andrés Marturián, stated that Jaime was not cooperating with the arrest warrant issued by Bonadio because it was “arbitrary and not firm.” Describing the warrant as “a clear sign of perversity” and “mendacity” and a “violation of constitutional principles,” Marturián said that he would appeal the warrant and appeal the judge’s refusal to exempt Jaime from prison. He also declined to say where Jaime was. Marturian assured the court that Jaime had not left the country and that he would appear in court after a decision was made in his <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>exemption</b> from prison. As of July 15, 2013, he was considered a “fugitive from justice.” ...|$|E
5000|$|On May 19, 2010 the EPA gave BP 24 {{hours to}} choose less toxic {{alternatives}} to Corexit, {{selected from the}} list of EPA-approved dispersants on the National Contingency Plan Product Schedule, and begin applying them within 72 hours of EPA approval of their choices; or, if BP could not find an alternative, to provide a report on the alternative dispersants investigated and reasons for their rejection. BP took the latter option, sending its report the next day. BP's response to dispersant alternatives was judged to be deficient by both the EPA and the US Coast Guard, requiring EPA to perform its own analysis on the relative toxicity of dispersants. Their peer-reviewed conclusions on August 2, 2010 found that Corexit 9500A was generally neither more nor less toxic than the other available dispersants, and that dispersant-oil mixtures were not generally more nor less toxic to test species than oil alone. [...] On May 26, the EPA told BP to reduce the use of Corexit by 75%; surface use was prohibited unless a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>exemption</b> in specific circumstances was granted, while subsurface use was capped at 15,000 gallons per day. After May 26 daily average use decreased 9%, an average of slightly more than 23,000 gallons per day.|$|E
40|$|This study {{takes a look}} at {{the change}} in <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>exemption</b> from co-payments (<b>for</b> a disease {{included}} in the list of the 30 exonerated disorders- ALD 30) for breast cancer among women affiliated with the general regimen (régime général) of French health insurance in the four departments of the Auvergne region (Allier, Cantal, Haute-Loire, Puy-de-Dôme). The populations compared were constituted by all patients diagnosed as having breast cancer requesting exemption from making co-payments (ALD 30 entitlement) in 1994 or in 1998. The results showed an increase in the declared number of breast cancers in 1998. This progression could be explained, in part, by a the relative aging of the population. At the same time, part of this increase appears unrelated to age. An analysis of the stages at which this disease was diagnosed demonstrates that in the department of the Puy-de-Dôme, there was a statistically significant increase in the number of breast cancers diagnosed at earlier stages...|$|R

50|$|HBCD's {{toxicity}} and its harm to {{the environment}} are currently discussed. HBCD can be found in environmental samples such as birds, mammals, fish and other aquatic organisms as well as soil and sediment.On this basis, on 28 October 2008 the European Chemicals Agency decided to include HBCD in the SVHC list, Substances of Very High Concern, within the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals framework. On 18 February 2011, HBCD was listed in the Annex XIV of REACH and hence is subject to Authorisation. HBCD can be used until the so-called “sunset date” (21 August 2015). After that date, only authorised applications will be allowed in the EU. HBCD has been found widely present in biological samples from remote areas and supporting evidences for its classification as Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic (PBT) and undergoes long-range environmental transportation.In July 2012, an EU harmonised classification and labelling for HBCD entered into force. HBCD has been classified as a category 2 for reproductive toxicity. Since August 2010 hexabromocyclododecanes are included in the EPA's List of Chemicals of Concern.On May 2013 the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) decided to include HBCD in the Convention’s Annex A for elimination, with specific exemptions for expanded and extruded polystyrene in buildings needed to give countries time to phase-in safer substitutes. HBCD is listed for elimination, but with a specific exemption for expanded polystyrene (EPS) and extruded polystyrene (XPS) in buildings. Countries may choose to use this exemption for up to five years after the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>exemption</b> is submitted.
