5|$|Midazolam {{is known}} to cause <b>respiratory</b> <b>depression.</b> In healthy humans, 0.15mg/kg of {{midazolam}} may cause <b>respiratory</b> <b>depression,</b> which is postulated to be a central nervous system (CNS) effect. When midazolam is administered in combination with fentanyl, the incidence of hypoxemia or apnea becomes more likely.|$|E

50|$|Between December 2003 and February 2004, 7 {{patients}} suffered respiratory {{arrests and}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>depressions</b> while Ben Geen was on duty. While 5 patients recovered soon after, two patients died in January 2004: Anthony Bateman and David Onley.

5|$|Because {{of their}} muscle relaxant action, benzodiazepines may cause <b>respiratory</b> <b>depression</b> in {{susceptible}} individuals. For that reason, they are contraindicated {{in people with}} myasthenia gravis, sleep apnea, bronchitis, and COPD. Caution is required when benzodiazepines are used in people with personality disorders or intellectual disability because of frequent paradoxical reactions. In major depression, they may precipitate suicidal tendencies and are sometimes used for suicidal overdoses. Individuals {{with a history of}} alcohol, opioid and barbiturate abuse should avoid benzodiazepines, as there is a risk of life-threatening interactions with these drugs.|$|E
5|$|Some authors {{challenge}} {{the validity of}} the second step (mild opioids) and, pointing to their higher toxicity and low efficacy, argue that mild opioids could be replaced by small doses of strong opioids (with the possible exception of tramadol due to its demonstrated efficacy in cancer pain, its specificity for neuropathic pain, and its low sedative properties and reduced potential for <b>respiratory</b> <b>depression</b> in comparison to conventional opioids).|$|E
5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause severe complications in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, <b>respiratory</b> <b>depression,</b> and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Amitraz is an insecticide/acaricide. Accidental amitraz {{poisoning}} {{in children}} is an emerging problem worldwide. Poisoning may occur by ingestion, inhalation or transdermally. As {{there is no}} specific antidote for amitraz poisoning, management is supportive and symptomatic. The toxic effect of amitraz is manifested by central nervous system <b>depression,</b> <b>respiratory</b> system <b>depression,</b> bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, hyperglycemia, nausea and vomiting. The vital functions should be closely monitored. We present {{a case of a}} 3 -year-old boy who accidentally ingested amitraz and was admitted to our Pediatric department. He presented with deep depression of both central nervous system and respiratory system. Our intention is to inform the medical community about this rare but emerging problem...|$|R

25|$|The {{symptoms}} of acute non-medical exposure {{are similar to}} those of alcohol intoxication, beginning with headache, dizziness, and confusion and progressing with increasing exposure to unconsciousness. <b>Respiratory</b> and circulatory <b>depression</b> can result in death.|$|R
5|$|Although the {{incidence}} of respiratory depression/arrest is low (0.1–0.5%) when midazolam is administered alone at normal doses, the concomitant use with CNS acting drugs, mainly analgesic opiates, may increase the possibility of hypotension, <b>respiratory</b> <b>depression,</b> respiratory arrest, and death, even at therapeutic doses. Potential drug interactions involving at least one CNS depressant were observed for 84% of midazolam users who were subsequently required to receive the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. Therefore, efforts directed toward monitoring drug interactions and preventing injuries from midazolam administration {{are expected to have}} a substantial impact on the safe use of this drug.|$|E
5|$|Beer {{contains}} ethyl alcohol, {{the same}} chemical that {{is present in}} wine and distilled spirits and as such, beer consumption has short-term psychological and physiological effects on the user. Different concentrations of alcohol {{in the human body}} have different effects on a person. The effects of alcohol depend on the amount an individual has drunk, the percentage of alcohol in the beer and the timespan over which the consumption took place, the amount of food eaten and whether an individual has taken other prescription, over-the-counter or street drugs, among other factors. Drinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03%-0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria, increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC from 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g., slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit (pulmonary aspiration) while unconscious) and <b>respiratory</b> <b>depression</b> (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening <b>respiratory</b> <b>depression</b> and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. As with all alcoholic drinks, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have severe criminal penalties against drunk driving.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{require special}} {{precaution}} if used {{in children and}} in alcohol- or drug-dependent individuals. Particular care should be taken in pregnant or elderly people, people with substance abuse history (particularly alcohol dependence), and people with comorbid psychiatric disorders. The use of alprazolam should be avoided or carefully monitored by medical professionals in individuals with: myasthenia gravis, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, severe liver deficiencies (e.g., cirrhosis), severe sleep apnea, pre-existing <b>respiratory</b> <b>depression,</b> marked neuromuscular respiratory, acute pulmonary insufficiency, chronic psychosis, hypersensitivity or allergy to alprazolam or other benzodiazepines, and borderline personality disorder (where it may induce suicidality and dyscontrol).|$|E

25|$|With {{increasing}} pressure and {{progression of the}} hernia there will be distortion of the brainstem leading to Duret hemorrhages (tearing of small vessels in the parenchyma) in the median and paramedian zones of the mesencephalon and pons. The rupture of these vessels leads to linear or flamed shaped hemorrhages. The disrupted brainstem can lead to decorticate posture, <b>respiratory</b> center <b>depression</b> and death. Other possibilities resulting from brain stem distortion include lethargy, slow heart rate, and pupil dilation.|$|R
5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, {{methoxyflurane}} is {{a significant}} respiratory depressant. In dogs, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in respiratory rate and a marked decrease in respiratory minute volume, with a relatively mild decrease in tidal volume. In humans, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant. The net effect of these changes is profound <b>respiratory</b> <b>depression,</b> as evidenced by CO2 retention with a concomitant decrease in arterial pH (this {{is referred to as}} a respiratory acidosis) when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for any length of time.|$|E
5|$|When the {{pressure}} within the skull (intracranial pressure, abbreviated ICP) rises too high, {{it can be}} deadly. Signs of increased ICP include decreasing level of consciousness, paralysis or weakness {{on one side of}} the body, and a blown pupil, one that fails to constrict in response to light or is slow to do so. Cushing's triad, a slow heart rate with high blood pressure and <b>respiratory</b> <b>depression</b> is a classic manifestation of significantly raised ICP. Anisocoria, unequal pupil size, is another sign of serious TBI. Abnormal posturing, a characteristic positioning of the limbs caused by severe diffuse injury or high ICP, is an ominous sign.|$|E
5|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of benzodiazepines that tolerance to therapeutic effects develops relatively quickly while many adverse effects persist. Tolerance develops to hypnotic and myorelexant effects within days to weeks, and to anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects within weeks to months. Therefore, benzodiazepines {{are unlikely to}} be effective long-term treatments for sleep and anxiety. While BZD therapeutic effects disappear with tolerance, depression and impulsivity with high suicidal risk commonly persist. Several studies have confirmed that long-term benzodiazepines are not significantly different from placebo for sleep or anxiety. This may explain why patients commonly increase doses over time and many eventually take more than one type of benzodiazepine after the first loses effectiveness. Additionally, because tolerance to benzodiazepine sedating effects develops more quickly than does tolerance to brainstem depressant effects, those taking more benzodiazepines to achieve desired effects may suffer sudden <b>respiratory</b> <b>depression,</b> hypotension or death. Most patients with anxiety disorders and PTSD have symptoms that persist for at least several months, making tolerance to therapeutic effects a distinct problem for them and necessitating the need for more effective long-term treatment (e.g., psychotherapy, serotonergic antidepressants).|$|E

40|$|Fourteen {{patients}} with obstructive emphysema showed less rise in ventilation while breathing 3, 5, and 7 % carbon dioxide than did 19 normal subjects.

30|$|Additionally, {{pulmonary}} artery catheter permits hemoglobin oxygen saturation of mixed venous blood (SvO 2) measurement or continuous recording. In fact, patients detected {{with an increase}} in PAOP during SBTs, usually experience a substantial decline in SvO 2 during SBTs [44, 45] that reflects inadequate oxygen delivery for the increased oxygen consumption, indicating, thus, the contribution of cardiovascular dysfunction. These patients have a high likelihood of failure to wean. In contrast, SvO 2 usually remains unchanged in patients who are successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation [44]. However, a subset of failed-to-wean patients whose SvO 2 does not decrease has been described [45]. These patients do not have increased oxygen consumption during weaning failure, possibly due to <b>respiratory</b> center <b>depression</b> in some of the cases.|$|R
5000|$|Premature {{infants with}} {{immature}} brains and reflex systems {{are at high}} risk for central sleep apnea syndrome, even if these babies are otherwise healthy. Premature babies who have the syndrome will generally outgrow it as they mature, provided that they receive careful enough monitoring and supportive care during infancy to survive. Because of premature infants' propensity toward central apnea, medications that can cause <b>respiratory</b> drive <b>depression</b> are either not given to them or administered to them only under careful monitoring, with equipment for resuscitation immediately available. Such precautions are routinely taken for premature infants after general anesthesia; administration of caffeine has been found not only to aid in maintenance of respiratory function after general anaesthesia but to reduce apnea for preterm infants regardless of context.|$|R
