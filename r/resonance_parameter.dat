The use of the <b>resonance</b> <b>parameters</b> issued from such analysis for further reconstruction of the cross section with codes like NJOY can result in non negligible errors in the cross-sections {{as well as in the}} reaction rates. To analyze the bias introduced on <b>resonance</b> <b>parameters</b> by the use of the free gas model and its consequences on reaction rates we set up a numerical experiment that closely follows the actual scheme of the nuclear data evaluation First, we use <b>resonance</b> <b>parameters</b> from JEF 2. 2 nuclear library to calculate our reference cross section with Lamb’s harmonic crystal model. This cross section is then used to simulate a transmission coefficients, and a new set of <b>resonance</b> <b>parameters</b> are obtained using the code REFIT to fit the shape of the transmission with the help of the free gas model. These <b>resonance</b> <b>parameters</b> are used to estimate the errors on the reaction rates. We conclude that the free gas model does not ensure reaction rate conservation. A comparison of the capture rates showed that the discrepancy between this model (with the bias on the <b>resonance</b> <b>parameters</b> described above) and the harmonic crystal model (with initial JEF 2. 2 parameters) is important for reactor physics. For the first resonance of uranium, which represents 30 % of the absorption in a thermal nuclear reactor, the error in the capture reaction rates reaches 3 % for the biased <b>resonance</b> <b>parameters</b> issued from UO 2 analysis, and up to 1 % for the biased <b>resonance</b> <b>parameters</b> issued from metallic uranium analysis.

The ENDF format now permits use of <b>resonance</b> <b>parameter</b> CMs from File 32, MT= 151, that correspond to resonances in File 2, MT= 151.

The fashion in which the S-matrix is thus constructed, allows the location of multi-channel and single channel resonances, their partial widths, {{as well as to}} obtain the scattering cross sections, even for channels for which no data is available.
