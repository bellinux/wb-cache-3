Along this coast, the cliffs are layered with {{compressed}} strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown Lias embedded with fossils. The Shaline Company was founded in 1924 to exploit these strata but was unable to raise sufficient capital. The company's <b>retort</b> <b>house</b> is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil and is all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E
5|$|At Kilve are {{the remains}} of a red brick retort, built in 1924, when it was {{discovered}} that the shale found in the cliffs was rich in oil. The beach is part of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Along this coast the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown lias embedded with fossils.

These gasification plants synthesised town gas from oil refinery material and natural gas, until the eventual 1996 conversion of the older suburbs to natural gas.|$|R
5000|$|The {{engine was}} built to work at Provan Gasworks, Glasgow in 1946. At the time Provan Gasworks had an {{extensive}} [...] gauge railway running through the gas works and Dougal {{was one of the}} many engines built to run on it. Gas works lines like this usually meant working in the very restricted confines of <b>retort</b> <b>houses,</b> explaining Dougal's small and especially low shape. In 1958 the gas works were closed and Dougal was no longer required. In 1961 Dougal was saved from scrap and later sold to the Welshpool and Llanfair Light Railway.|$|R
50|$|At the {{original}} plant {{it had made}} gas by coking coal in a horizontal retort and then capturing and storing the gas that was released. The new plant encased a brick <b>retort,</b> purifying <b>house</b> and two gas holders within the cylindrical buildings. The thick walls helped prevent the gas from condensing in the cold winters, and the conical roof accommodated the gasholder, a telescoping series of cylinders that rose within guides as the volume of gas increased. Water {{in the bottom of}} the pit made the seal impermeable.|$|R

Although she believes in the importance of hope, Thirteen says in [...] "Changes" [...] that she believes that people are intrinsically happy or miserable, and that this cannot be changed. House states that this is her defense mechanism, because if she can convince herself that she would have been miserable either way, she does not need to resent the fact that her life is full of misfortune rather than fortune. Thirteen <b>retorts</b> that <b>House's</b> life is similarly miserable and that [...] "lotteries are stupid".|$|R

2500|$|Historically, Launceston was {{powered by}} {{gas from the}} Launceston Gas Company (later Gas Corporation of Tasmania). The first gas plant was built in 1860 as a {{horizontal}} <b>retort</b> Gas Works <b>house</b> made from brick and sandstone on the site's SW corner. This was followed by keepers cottages, labs, the Headquarters Building and the iconic 1930s vertical retort recognised by the wording [...] "COOK WITH GAS" [...] written in its brickwork. The Duck Reach Power Station replaced gas for street lighting when it was completed in 1895 (the first municipally owned power station in the Southern Hemisphere). Until the 1950s when Trevallyn Power Station was built, Duck Reach supplied Launceston with most of its power needs â€“ it is now an interpretive historic site. The former Gas Works houses a Cafe.|$|R

Even your mother knew nothing of it till years afterwards--so that no man should be a penny the poorer for having trusted his good name. Do you think the crew of chandlers and brokers, dock hustlers and freight wreckers would have found him a useful man of business, even had they come to settle here?" ...|$|R

50|$|In June 2012 a {{proposal}} by developer Ross Harrison was put {{forward to the}} Launceston City Council to incorporate the Vertical <b>Retort</b> <b>House</b> and Carburetted Water Gas Building into a restaurant and bar with additional commercial space. In late July 2012, the site changed zoning from industrial to commercial and work commenced on cleaning {{the building of the}} accumulated pigeon droppings and polystyrene blocks that were dumped inside it. In mid-September removal of the Corrugated Asbestos Roofing started. On the 10 October 2012, the original 1932 machinery was blow-torched out of the building to be taken away followed by disassembly of the fire-brick retorts except for the coke extractors which were partially retained for aesthetic value. The completed works now link the two buildings with a glass atrium as the earlier proposal had intended. A bar and reception area are currently located on the 1st floor (ground level) of the Vertical <b>Retort</b> <b>House</b> under the former retort blocks with restaurant space occupying the area between the two buildings and into the Carburetted Water Gas Building. The upper levels of both buildings have been remodeled to support retail and office spaces. The machinery within the Vertical <b>Retort</b> <b>House</b> underwent a heritage survey to assess the historic value of the surviving equipment and from that, local architectural firm, ARTAS, was left to incorporate this into the final design. Removed machinery was intended to be kept as museum exhibits but has yet to be utilized for such purposes. At present all the machinery in the Vertical Retort has been removed except for a few components on the ground level and the waste heat boiler on the floors above, with salvaged components stored in the Horizontal <b>Retort</b> <b>House.</b>|$|E
