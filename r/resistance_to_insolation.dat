30|$|Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) used {{a simple}} ice model based on 21 June {{insolation}} at 65 ° N {{with a set}} lag <b>to</b> <b>insolation</b> allowing for ice sheet response time. This phase lag is adjusted during the late Pliocence to early Pleistocene from 5 to 15 kyr from 3.0 to 1.5, to represent the increasing ice mass during this interval. In contrast, the aridity record of the Maldives is directly tuned <b>to</b> <b>insolation</b> <b>to</b> represent the highly sensitive response of Indian-Asian hydroclimate <b>to</b> <b>insolation</b> changes. As {{a result of the}} different tuning approaches, our records of the Maldives lead the LR 04 benthic stacked record (Fig.  12). The consistency of this phase lead should serve as a test of the robustness of the tuning approaches of either the LR 04 stack or our record.

The Fe/K[*]cycles at Site U 1467 track northern hemisphere summer insolation, reflecting on moisture supply from the Arabian Sea. Sensitivity experiments support the assumption that positive summer rainfall shows a strong relationship with orbital precession (Clemens and Prell 1991). Visual inspection of the Fe/K record revealed the glacial-interglacial cycles and precession-driven cycles. On {{the basis of the}} presence of distinct precession cycles (particularly during interglacials) and initial age modelling, we tuned the Fe/K record to precession. Our approach was to correlate maximum Fe/K ratios <b>to</b> <b>insolation</b> peaks (precession minima) and minimum Fe/K ratios <b>to</b> <b>insolation</b> lows (precession maxima).|$|R

In order to confidently link stratigraphic signals <b>to</b> <b>insolation</b> periodicities, {{a description of the}} stratigraphy is required based on quantities that directly relate to intrinsic properties of the layers. We use stereo digital terrain models (DTMs) from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment to derive a characteristic of north polar layered deposit (NPLD) strata that can be correlated over large distances: the topographic protrusion of layers exposed in troughs, which is a proxy for the layers' <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> erosion. Using a combination of image analysis and a signal-matching algorithm to correlate continuous depth-protrusion signals taken from DTMs at different locations, we construct a stratigraphic column that describes the upper similar to 500 m of at least 7 % of the area of the NPLD and find accumulation rates that vary byfactors of up to 2. We find that, when coupled with observations of exposed layers in images, the topographic expression of the strata is consistently continuous across large distances in the top 300 - 500 m of the NPLD, suggesting that it is better related to intrinsic layer properties than the brightness of exposed layers alone...|$|R

40|$|Little {{has been}} done {{to address the issue of}} how <b>to</b> {{overcome}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change in a change effort in the church world. “How <b>to</b> overcome <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change?” is a question that requires serious consideration among church leaders. Church leaders continue to act in ways that produce <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and ultimately failed change efforts. These actions on the part of church leaders often strengthen and reinforce the sources of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, making it very difficult for change to be accepted by church members. A literature study design was used to conduct this research. The purpose of this research was to: • Understand the phenomenon of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change • To determine the actions of leaders that generate <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change • To determine how church leaders can overcome <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change The research indicates that church leaders make too many errors in a change process that generates <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. The research has found eight actions of leaders that generates <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change by followers. Apart from the eight actions of leaders that produce <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, many change agents continue to function as managers and not leaders in a change process. This results in further <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. The research clearly shows that for church leaders <b>to</b> effectively overcome <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, they need to follow a multi-stage change process, which is comprehensive, sequential and one that develops naturally and addresses all the sources of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. The research shows that church leaders should not skip or race through the steps or fail to reinforce earlier steps in the process of overcoming <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change.

40|$|LOVECLIM {{was used}} to {{simulate}} the climate response <b>to</b> <b>insolation</b> and CO 2 forcings during the nine interglacials of the last 800, 000 years. The relative impacts of insolation and CO 2 on different climatic variables and on different regions are quantified through simulations with LOVECLIM and using the factor separation technique. The {{results show that the}} relative contribution of insolation and CO 2 on the warmth intensity varies from one interglacial to another. They also show that CO 2 plays a dominant role on the variations of the global annual mean temperature and the southern high latitude temperature and sea ice, whereas, insolation plays a dominant role on the variations of monsoon precipitation, vegetation and of the northern high latitude temperature and sea ice. Our simulations also help to understand the origin of the Mid- Brunhes Transition (MBE) which is characterized by change in the interglacial amplitude about 430, 000 years ago. As far as the surface climate is concerned, MBE appears mainly in the variables dominated by CO 2 and it is not clear in the variables dominated by insolation. This explains the absence of MBE in some regional records. However, the oceanic response <b>to</b> <b>insolation</b> is more complex depending significantly on the interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. Insolation alone can induce a MBE in some oceanic processes which are critical for the carbon cycle.

Relative to the responses of a susceptible strain of diamondback moth, the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Cry 1 C of the selected strain increased to 62 -fold after six generations of selection.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2000. The {{management}} of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change by school principals of secondary {{schools in the}} North-West Province was investigated in this study. Changes are continually occurring on all levels of a rapidly developing society, and resistance is an inseparable part of this process. Since the school stands {{in the center of}} the developing community, the school principal, as education manager, should have a firm knowledge of skills which will enable him to efficiently implement the {{management of}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. Examples of large-scale changes that occurred in education during the past five years are the implementation of Curriculum 2005 and the transformation of Model C schools. The aim of this research centered on the following problems: What is the nature of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change? What does the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change encompass? To what extent and in which way do school principals manage <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change? Firstly a literature study was undertaken to ascertain the nature of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, as well as methods and models according <b>to</b> which <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change can be managed. Findings from the literature study points to a number of aspects of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change which plays a decisive role in the management of change. These include factors giving rise <b>to</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, types of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, manifestations of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and reaction phases of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. The way in which <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change is managed is influenced by, among others, factors indicating whether or not the school is ready for change, techniques which can be employed in the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, and also existing models which can be used successfully to facilitate the management process of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. Secondly an empirical investigation was undertaken to investigate the degree and way in which school principals manage <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. For this purpose a structured questionnaire as well as a semi-structured interview schedule was used. Findings from the empirical interview revealed that in general school principals handled the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change better than what was initially surmised, although few of them had enough relevant knowledge to be considered specialists in this field. Recommendations ensuing from this study comprise the inclusion of a module in educational management courses specifically aimed at change, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and especially the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change with the view to better equip education managers, the development of a refined model for the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change in schools, and also further research into such management model(s) to ascertain the practical application or its relevance in practice.

Expression of field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Striga appears to be quantitative suggesting the involvement of quantitative trait loci (QTL). However, many of these loci including the one responsible {{for the production of}} low germination stimulant (lgs) have not been mapped. The objectives of this study were to (i) construct a molecular map of the sorghum genome and to map the (lgs) gene, (ii) estimate heritability and response <b>to</b> selection of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> these two Striga species (iii) estimate genetic correlation between field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> these two Striga species (iv) identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> two species of Striga in sorghum (v) compare the efficiency of predicted response to marker-based selection (MBS) and marker-assisted (MAS) selection relative to phenotypic selection for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Striga. A sorghum linkage map based on one 168 RI lines and 236 molecular marker loci was constructed. The population was mapped using RAPDs, RFLPs, I-SSR and SSR markers. The estimated map size was 1628 cM, with an average interval of 9. 5 cM between adjacent loci. The lgs gene mapped 11. 8 cM from RFLP marker PI 0200725. Narrow sense heritability (h 2) of field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. asiatica was estimated at 0. 35 and that of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. hermonthica at 0. 24. Predicted response <b>to</b> selection for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the two Striga species was the same. Significant genetic correlation (0. 52) was found between <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. hermonthica and S. asiatica. Single marker analysis linking field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> marker data detected six QTL for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. hermonthica and five QTLs for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. asiatica.
