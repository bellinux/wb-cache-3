2500|$|BBC {{reported}} that Khem Lata Wukhloo, {{who was a}} leader of the Congress party at the time, admitted the widespread rigging in Kashmir. He stated: [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a massive rigging in 1987 elections. The losing candidates were declared winners. It shook the ordinary people's faith in the elections and the democratic process." ...|$|E

[...] "I respect your stand and wish you well. My duty lies elsewhere." [...] We shook hands and I never saw him again.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2016, Savchenko wrote: [...] "It is {{an absurd}} {{situation}} when those who abduct people and subject them to torture then {{act as if}} {{they have a right to}} judge them! How can one talk about a fair trial? In Russia, there are no trials or investigations—only a farce played out by Kremlin puppets. [...] those in the world with democratic values ought to learn their history lessons before it's too late and <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a time when Europe was tolerant toward Hitler, and America wasn't decisive enough, and this led to World War II." ...|$|E
2500|$|Niche {{differentiation}} {{can arise}} from current competition. [...] For instance, species X has a fundamental niche {{of the entire}} slope of a hillside, but its realized niche is only the top portion of the slope because species Y, which is a better competitor but cannot survive on the top portion of the slope, has excluded it from the lower portion of the slope. [...] With this scenario, competition will continue indefinitely {{in the middle of}} the slope between these two species. [...] Because of this, detection of the presence of niche differentiation (through competition) will be relatively easy. [...] It is also important to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no evolutionary change of the individual species in this case; rather this is an ecological effect of species Y out-competing species X within the bounds of species Y's fundamental niche.|$|E

2500|$|The {{cause of}} Ruskin's [...] "disgust" [...] {{has led to}} much speculation. Ruskin's biographer, Mary Lutyens, {{suggested}} that he rejected Effie because he was horrified {{by the sight of}} her pubic hair. Lutyens argued that Ruskin must have known the female form only through Greek statues and paintings of the nude lacking pubic hair and found the reality shocking. However, Peter Fuller in his book Theoria: Art and the Absence of Grace writes, [...] "It has been said that he was frightened on the wedding night by the sight of his wife's pubic hair; more probably, he was perturbed by her menstrual blood." [...] Ruskin's biographers Tim Hilton and John Batchelor also take the view that menstruation is the more likely explanation, though Batchelor also suggests that body-odour may have been the problem. Debate cannot currently resolve this issue; William Ewart Gladstone said to his daughter, Mary, [...] "should you ever hear anyone blame Millais or his wife, or Mr. Ruskin, <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no fault; there was misfortune, even tragedy. All three were perfectly blameless.".|$|E
