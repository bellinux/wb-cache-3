He pushed a proposal to automatically enroll employees in Individual <b>Retirement</b> <b>Accounts</b> (IRAs), and successfully lobbied President Barack Obama to include it in a proposed 2009 budget outline.|$|E

In the {{aftermath}} of Enron, he co-sponsored (with Barbara Boxer) legislation, which was later propounded by Ted Kennedy, that reforms the 401(k) plan {{to minimize the risk}} of investment portfolios. The plan was opposed by President George W. Bush and faced strong opposition in Congress.

25|$|Critics of Social Security {{claim that}} it gives a low rate of return, {{compared}} to what is obtained through private <b>retirement</b> <b>accounts.</b> For example, critics point out that under the Social Security laws as they existed at that time, several thousand employees of Galveston County, Texas were allowed {{to opt out of}} the Social Security program in the early 1980s, and have their money placed in a private retirement plan instead. While employees who earned $50,000 per year would have collected $1,302 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $6,843 per month. While employees who earned $20,000 per year would have collected $775 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $2,740 per month, at interest rates prevailing in 1996. While some advocates of privatization of Social Security point to the Galveston pension plan as a model for Social Security reform, critics point to a GAO report to the House Ways and Means Committee, which indicates that, for low and middle income employees, particularly those with shorter work histories, the outcome may be less favorable.|$|E
25|$|Many factors affect people's {{retirement}} decisions. Retirement funding {{education is}} a big factor that affects the success of an individual’s retirement experience. Social Security clearly {{plays an important role}} because most individuals solely rely on Social Security as their only retirement option, when Social Security’s both trust funds are expected to be depleted by 2034. Knowledge affects an individual’s retirement decisions by simply finding more reliable retirement options such as, Individual <b>Retirement</b> <b>Accounts</b> or Employer-Sponsored Plans. In countries around the world, people {{are much more likely to}} retire at the early and normal retirement ages of the public pension system (e.g., ages 62 and 65 in the U.S.). This pattern cannot be explained by different financial incentives to retire at these ages since typically retirement benefits at these ages are approximately actuarially fair; that is, the present value of lifetime pension benefits (pension wealth) conditional on retiring at age a is approximately the same as pension wealth conditional on retiring one year later at age a+1. Nevertheless, a large literature has found that individuals respond significantly to financial incentives relating to retirement (e.g., to discontinuities stemming from the Social Security earnings test or the tax system).|$|E
500|$|Credit {{issues were}} {{becoming}} more critical, however. Around {{the time the}} buyout was made public, Moody's and S both reduced Enron's rating to just one notch above junk status. Were the company's rating to fall below investment-grade, its ability to trade would be severely limited {{if there was a}} reduction or elimination of its credit lines with competitors. In a conference call, S affirmed that, were Enron not to be bought, S would reduce its rating to low BB or high B, ratings noted as being within junk status. Additionally, many traders had limited their involvement with Enron, or stopped doing business altogether, fearing more bad news. Watson again attempted to re-assure, attesting at a presentation to investors that there was [...] "nothing wrong with Enron's business". He also acknowledged that remunerative steps (in the form of more stock options) would have to be taken to redress the animosity of many Enron employees towards management after it was revealed that Lay and other officials had sold hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of stock during the months prior to the crisis. The situation was not helped by the disclosure that Lay, his [...] "reputation in tatters", stood to receive a payment of $60 million as a change-of-control fee subsequent to the Dynegy acquisition, while many Enron employees had seen their <b>retirement</b> <b>accounts,</b> which were based largely on Enron stock, ravaged as the price decreased 90% in a year. An official at a company owned by Enron stated [...] "We had some married couples who both worked who lost as much as $800,000 or $900,000.
