25|$|Goodbye to Language {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{acclaimed}} films of 2014 and appeared on several critics' year-end best film lists. Critics who listed the film as the best film of the year include Carlo Chatrian, Scott Foundas, J. Hoberman, John Powers, James Quandt, Jean-François Rauger, Jonathan Rosenbaum, Dan Sullivan, Amy Taubin, Armond White, and Blake Williams. The staffs of Cahiers du cinéma, Film Comment and the British Film Institute's Sight & Sound all listed it as 2nd place. Other critics who listed it as one of the year's best films include Kong Rithdee, Michael Atkinson, Richard Brody, David Ehrenstein, Dennis Lim, Richard Corliss, Glenn Kenny, Mathieu Macheret, Jonathan Romney, Molly Haskell, Miriam Bale, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky, Manohla Dargis and Michael Phillips, and the staffs of <b>Reverse</b> <b>Shot,</b> The Village Voice, Indiewire, CineVue and The A.V. Club.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} shot in bright, primary colors rather than the {{black-and-white}} of the director's previous features, but it retained his usual languid pacing. Jarmusch characterized the color choice as [...] "intuitive". He deliberately chose a cool color palette, eschewing yellows and oranges and using only sporadic dashes of red (as in the Japanese couple's ubiquitous suitcase). This motif of flashes of red was later described by Suzanne Scott of <b>Reverse</b> <b>Shot</b> as [...] "giving {{the impression of a}} failed attempt to grab a bit of Elvis’s glamor and try it on for size, only to inevitably discover that it looks cartoonish out of context". Stills from the film as well as on-location shots of the actors and the film crew by photographer Masayoshi Sukita were published to accompany the film as the photo collection Mystery Train: A Film by Jim Jarmusch.|$|E
500|$|The New York Times {{reviewer}} Nathan Lee described The Man from London as [...] "bloated, formalist art", and an [...] "outrageously stylized, conceptually demanding film" [...] that dehumanizes and alienates its audience. Conversely, Jeff Reichert of <b>Reverse</b> <b>Shot,</b> {{a long-time}} Tarr enthusiast, commended the film for its technical dexterity and authoritative camera movement, comparing Tarr to Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-Hsien for his cinematic rigor. He did, however, consider the source material sub-par, and the musical score by Mihály Víg to be [...] "whirring [...] grat". In The Hollywood Reporter, Kirk Honeycutt complimented the intricacy of the cinematography and the monochrome photography, but judged {{the film to}} be [...] "tedious", [...] "repetitive" [...] and [...] "nearly unwatchable". In a review of Cannes' offerings for Time Out, Dave Calhoun too {{drew attention to the}} meticulous cinematography and signature shot length's of Tarr's [...] "austere and mesmeric" [...] film, and declared Swinton's dubbing into Hungarian one of the festival's strangest instances of cultural displacement.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} match against Rajasthan Royals, he hit 89 off 45 balls with eight fours and six sixes, which {{included}} frequent <b>reverse</b> <b>shots,</b> helping his team win against a high target.|$|R
5000|$|All of Burr's {{scenes were}} filmed {{in one day}} to suit his schedule. He was paid US $50,000. The <b>reverse</b> <b>shots,</b> of the actors he was {{speaking}} to, were filmed the next day, and the American filming was completed in three days. The filming was done at the Raleigh Studios in Los Angeles. The [...] "war room" [...] was a large montage of the war room from The Philadelphia Experiment, another film from the same studio.|$|R
50|$|Blair Campbell {{credited}} {{him with}} inventing the <b>reverse</b> punt <b>shot</b> at goal (he was most certainly the first VFL player to do so).|$|R
500|$|When Bowden gives Dussander an SS uniform to {{wear and}} in which to march under Bowden's orders, the student's demands are more {{heightened}} in the film as [...] "more dominant and voyeuristic", according to Picart and Frank. Bowden tells Dussander, [...] "I tried to do this the nice way, but you don't want it. So fine, we'll do this the hard way. You will put this on, because I {{want to see you}} in it. Now move!" [...] The editing style of the Nazi march scene juxtaposes Dussander marching in the uniform and Bowden reacting to the march. Shots of Bowden's reaction are from a low angle, which reflects [...] "the sexual difference between the characters"; Bowden is masculinized as [...] "the bearer of the [...] gaze", and Dussander is feminized as [...] "the object of the gaze". The cutting between Bowden and Dussander [...] "corroborates a homoerotic arrangement of images" [...] which visualizes the latent homoeroticism of the scene from the novella. When Dussander speeds up his march and Bowden tells him to stop, the sped-up shot <b>reverse</b> <b>shot</b> [...] "radically [...] the structure of power", where Bowden loses [...] "control of his sadistic power over Dussander".|$|E
500|$|Later, Mulholland Drive {{was named}} the best film of the decade by the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, Cahiers du cinéma, IndieWire, Slant Magazine, <b>Reverse</b> <b>Shot,</b> The Village Voice and Time Out New York, who asked rhetorically in a {{reference}} to the September 11 attacks, [...] "Can there be another movie that speaks as resonantly— if unwittingly— to the awful moment that marked our decade?... Mulholland Drive is the monster behind the diner; it's the self-delusional dream turned into nightmare." [...] It was also voted best of the decade in a Film Comment poll of international [...] "critics, programmers, academics, filmmakers and others", and by the magazine's readers. It appeared on lists among the ten best films of the decade, coming in third according to The Guardian, Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers, the Canadian Press, Access Hollywood critic Scott Mantz, and eighth on critic Michael Phillips' list. In 2010 it {{was named the}} second best arthouse film ever by The Guardian. The film was voted as the 11th best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of Los Angeles Times writers and editors with the primary criterion of communicating an inherent truth about the L.A. experience. Empire magazine placed Mulholland Drive at number 391 on their list of the five hundred greatest films ever. It has also been ranked number 38 on the Channel 4 program 50 Films to See Before You Die. In 2011, online magazine Slate named Mulholland Drive in its piece on [...] "New Classics" [...] as the most enduring film since 2000.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{reviewing}} the film at AboutFilm.com, Carlo Cavagna regards {{this as a}} misleading classification, as does Leo Goldsmith, writing at notcoming.com, and the review on Blu-ray.com. Writing in TV Guide, Maitland McDonagh writes [...] "No one familiar with the cold precision of Kubrick's work will be surprised that this isn't the steamy erotic thriller a synopsis (or the ads) might suggest." [...] Writing in general about the genre of 'erotic thriller' for CineAction in 2001, Douglas Keesey states that [...] "whatever [...] actual type, [...] was at least marketed as an erotic thriller". Michael Koresky, writing in the 2006 issue of film journal <b>Reverse</b> <b>Shot,</b> writes [...] "this director, who defies expectations at every turn and brings genre to his feet, was... setting out to make neither the 'erotic thriller' that the press maintained nor an easily identifiable 'Kubrick film'". DVD Talk similarly dissociates the film from this genre.|$|E
5|$|Renoir used few close-ups or <b>reverse</b> <b>shots</b> {{and most}} of the shots are two shots. The hunt scene differs {{from the rest of the}} film; it uses rapid editing whereas most of the film uses long takes of {{dialogue}} or action. Renoir wanted to shoot the film in color to take advantage of the beauty of Sologne in the winter but he was unable to secure funding from Jean Jay. One week before filming began Renoir tried to persuade Technicolor to fund the color cinematography but the company refused.|$|R
50|$|A <b>reverse</b> angle <b>shot,</b> in cinematography, is a shot {{taken from}} an angle 180˚ (opposite) to the {{previous}} one. It is used {{to show how the}} character reacts {{to the previous}} shot.|$|R
5000|$|The {{front cover}} (detail) of Tex Avery by Patrick Brion, {{published}} in France in 1986 while King Lear {{was still in}} production. It shows a <b>reversed</b> still <b>shot</b> of the wolf from Tex Averys 1949 cartoon Little Rural Riding Hood.|$|R
2500|$|He {{continued}} {{to experiment with}} his in-camera special effects, such as a <b>reverse</b> <b>shot</b> in A Dinner Under Difficulties, where he hand cranked a strip of film backwards through his camera to achieve the effect. He also experimented with superimposition, where he would film actors in a black background, then rewind the film through the camera and expose the footage again to create a double exposure. These films included The Cave of the Demons, in which transparent ghosts haunt a cave, and The Four Troublesome Heads, in which Méliès removes his own head three times and creates a musical chorus. Achieving these effects was extremely difficult and required skill. In a 1907 article, Méliès noted: [...] "Every second the actor playing different scenes ten times has to remember, while the film is rolling, exactly what he did {{at the same point}} in the preceding scenes and the exact place where he was on the stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Film {{theory is}} often {{dominated}} by feminism being {{played a major}} antagonist side of the film or made fun of. Feminists have taken many different approaches {{to the analysis of}} cinema. These include discussions of the function of women characters in particular film narratives or in particular genres, such as film noir, where a female character can often be seen to embody a subversive sexuality that is dangerous to males and is ultimately punished with death. In considering the way that films are put together many feminist film critics, such as Laura Mulvey, have pointed to the [...] "male gaze" [...] that predominates in classical Hollywood film making. Through the use of various film techniques, such as shot <b>reverse</b> <b>shot,</b> the viewers are led to align themselves with {{the point of view of}} a male protagonist. Notably, women function as objects of this gaze far more often than as proxies for the spectator. Feminist film theory of the last twenty years is heavily influenced by the general transformation in the field of aesthetics, including the new options of articulating the gaze, offered by psychoanalytical French feminism, like the matrixial gaze.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: ... however, in the <b>reverse</b> <b>shot,</b> Noriko is {{also seen}} from below, {{rather than from}} Aya's point of view, {{retaining}} the [...] "low" [...] camera angle.|$|E
50|$|Internal ejaculations, {{followed}} by images of semen dripping from the anus, are sometimes depicted in bareback gay pornography, {{where they are}} referred to by the term breeding or the <b>reverse</b> money <b>shot.</b> Breeding is sometimes {{followed by}} felching, which involves sucking the semen from the partner's anus.|$|R
50|$|Locations {{used for}} scenes beyond Capitol Pictures {{included}} the Appian Way scenes, which were {{shot at the}} Big Sky Movie Ranch in Simi Valley, and the western sequence, which was filmed at Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park. The well of Jehoshaphat sequence was shot at Bronson Canyon, formerly a quarry, in Griffith Park. The nightclub interiors, the scene of Carlotta and Hobie's date, was shot at the Hollywood Palladium, with the exterior at the Fonda Theatre and some <b>reverse</b> <b>shots</b> at the Chapman Plaza in Korea Town. Carlotta's house exterior was filmed at a 1927 home in the Los Feliz section of Los Angeles; {{this was also the}} locale for The Good Luck Bar, which stood in for the Imperial Gardens Chinese restaurant. The movie premiere was shot in the Los Angeles Theatre, selected for its spacious lobby.|$|R
5000|$|Kent {{described}} the filming process as [...] "stressful" [...] because of Wiseman's age. Kent explained [...] "So I {{really had to}} be focused. We needed double the time we had." [...] Wiseman's mother was on set and a [...] "very protective, loving environment" [...] was created. Kent explained {{after the release of}} the film that Wiseman was protected throughout the entire project: [...] "During the <b>reverse</b> <b>shots</b> where Amelia was abusing Sam verbally, we had Essie Davis yell at an adult stand-in on his knees. I didn't want to destroy a childhood to make this film—that wouldn't be fair." [...] Kent's friendship with Davis was a boon during filming and Kent praised her former classmate in the media: [...] "To her credit, she's Davis very receptive, likes to be directed and is a joy to work with." ...|$|R
5000|$|... the <b>reverse</b> <b>shot</b> {{is defined}} as a 180-degree camera turn to the {{preceding}} image, common in point of view and over the shoulder (in the latter, care must be applied to avoid a continuity error by violating the 180 degree rule), ...|$|E
5000|$|Shot <b>reverse</b> <b>shot</b> is {{a feature}} of the [...] "classical" [...] Hollywood style of {{continuity}} editing, which deemphasizes transitions between shots such that the spectator perceives one continuous action that develops linearly, chronologically, and logically. It is an example of an eyeline match.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} cinematography, the shot <b>reverse</b> <b>shot</b> {{scenes in the}} film were {{simultaneously}} shot with two different cameras. For Kechiche this technique not only facilitates editing but also adds beauty to the scene which feels more truthful. Another characteristic aspect of Blues cinematography is the predominance of close-ups.|$|E
50|$|The {{first was}} {{directed}} by Mariah Garnett. Sparro appears dressed in black, white, and gold clothing, singing alone, cut between city views, shots of urban streets filmed from moving cars, and <b>reverse</b> action <b>shots</b> of gold colored drinking glasses shattering against a black back drop. The video had a significantly low budget, and was later scrapped after Sparro's deal with Island Records.|$|R
2500|$|Vertov says in {{his essay}} [...] "The Man with a Movie Camera" [...] that he was {{fighting}} [...] "for a decisive cleaning up of film-language, for its complete separation from the language of theater and literature." [...] By the later segments of Kino-Pravda, Vertov was experimenting heavily, looking to abandon what he considered film clichés (and receiving criticism for it); his experimentation was even more pronounced and dramatic {{by the time of}} Man with a Movie Camera, which was filmed in Ukraine. Some have criticized the obvious stagings in this film as being at odds with Vertov's credos of [...] "life as it is" [...] and [...] "life caught unawares": the scene of the woman getting out of bed and getting dressed is obviously staged, as is the <b>reversed</b> <b>shot</b> of the chess pieces being pushed off a chess board and the tracking shot which films Mikhail Kaufman riding in a car filming a third car.|$|R
50|$|Although Associated-Rediffusion {{retained}} {{a number of}} rights, including approval of episode synopses, script approval, music approval, and viewing rights for the rushes and final cut, film scholars Jean-Pierre Berthomé and Francois Thomas argue that Welles remained in control much of the time, due to the fragmentary, piecemeal way in which much of the footage was shot, with the writer/director/presenter being {{the only person who}} could piece it all together. For instance, Welles shot most of his interviews with only one camera, focussed on the interviewee, and all of the <b>reverse</b> <b>shots</b> of him asking questions had to be shot later in a studio. Frequently, Welles's entire episodes would be heavily studio-dependent; his entire participation in an episode on bullfighting consisted of filming himself entering and sitting down at a bullfight, then filming the bullfight; and the reconstructing part of the audience seats in a studio, so he could record his bullfight commentary months after having watched it.|$|R
50|$|Shot <b>reverse</b> <b>shot</b> (or shot/countershot) {{is a film}} {{technique}} {{where one}} character is shown looking at another character (often off-screen), {{and then the other}} character is shown looking back at the first character. Since the characters are shown facing in opposite directions, the viewer assumes that they are looking at each other.|$|E
5000|$|Some films, like Alain Resnais's surreal [...] (1963), {{play with}} this technique. Cutting on action is used, instead of accentuating the {{continuity}} {{elements of the}} action, to trick and confuse the viewer. The director also plays with other aspects of continuity editing, such as subverting the 180 degree rule and shot <b>reverse</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E
50|$|All {{the movies}} {{containing}} LGBTQ themes, stories, plots, or characters, presented {{in any of}} the sections of the Venice Film Festival are considered eligible for the award. Specifically, these sections are: Concorso (Competition), Fuori Concorso (Out of Competition), Orizzonti (Horizons), Controcampo italiano (Italian <b>Reverse</b> <b>Shot),</b> Giornate degli Autori (Venice Days), and Settimana Internazionale della Critica (International Critics' Week).|$|E

50|$|Dreams {{of working}} in the film {{industry}} started forming during visits to Pinewood Studios, Shepperton Studios, and Elstree Studios in various counties in England. Elsey frequently ran into Jim Henson (Sesame Street, The Muppets Show) while on the lot. He eventually met Lyle Conway who was Henson's creature shop designer on The Dark Crystal. After repeated requests for a job, Conway gave Elsey his first break in the industry, putting him to work creating animatronics for the movie Little Shop of Horrors. In {{the course of his}} work, Elsey made many of the special Vine effects as well as the tongue of alien plant Audrey II. The experience taught Elsey the art of using mechanical effects to create the illusion of life in puppetry. They did a lot of <b>reverse</b> <b>shots,</b> turned the camera upside down, changed camera speeds, and other things that most engineers wouldn't have considered as solutions. That movie went on to be nominated for an Oscar for the plant, and won the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects in 1986.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{a system that}} generates cinematic replays for dialogue-based 3 D video games. The system exploits the narrative and geometric information present in these games and automatically computes camera framings and edits to build a coherent cinematic replay of the gaming session. We propose a novel importance-driven approach to cinematic replay. Rather than relying on actions performed by characters to drive the cinematography (as in idiom-based approaches), we rely {{on the importance of}} characters in the narrative. We first devise a mechanism to compute the varying importance of the characters. We then map importances of characters with different camera specifications, and propose a novel technique that (i) automatically computes camera positions satisfying given specifications, and (ii) provides smooth camera motions when transitioning between different specifications. We demonstrate the features of our system by implementing three camera behaviors (one for master shots, one for shots on the player character, and one for <b>reverse</b> <b>shots).</b> We present results obtained by interfacing our system with a full-fledged serious game (Nothing for Dinner) containing several hours of 3 D animated content...|$|R
50|$|The {{technique}} of continuity editing, {{part of the}} classical Hollywood style, was developed by early European and American directors, in particular, D.W. Griffith in his films such as The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance. The classical style embraces temporal and spatial continuity {{as a way of}} advancing narrative, using such techniques as the 180 degree rule, Establishing shot, and Shot <b>reverse</b> <b>shot.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{point of}} view shot (also known as POV shot, First-person shot or a {{subjective}} camera) is a short film scene that shows what a character (the subject) is looking at (represented through the camera). It is usually established by being positioned between a shot of a character looking at something, and a shot showing the character's reaction (see shot <b>reverse</b> <b>shot).</b> The technique of POV {{is one of the}} foundations of film editing.|$|E

The weapons include the Striker weapon which adds additional firepower through vertically aligned Options, the <b>Reverse</b> <b>shot</b> which fires two diagonal shots {{from the rear of the}} ship, the Six Way Shot which fires semi-automatic shots in six directions and the Homing Shot which tracks enemies all around the screen.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Silent Despair" [...] was {{directed}} by Misko Iho and takes place in {{what appears to be}} Abreu's apartment. The video features shots of Abreu lying on the couch and in the bathtub singing.

In his team's opening match against Chennai Super Kings, he scored 95 runs from 43 balls (with 15 fours and two sixes) to chase down a target of 206 in 18.5 overs. In the second match against Rajasthan Royals, he hit 89 off 45 balls with eight fours and six sixes, which {{included}} frequent <b>reverse</b> <b>shots,</b> helping his team win against a high target. In the third match, Maxwell scored 95 runs from 43 balls with 9 sixes and 5 fours against Sunrisers Hyderabad and was awarded Man of the Match {{for the third time}} in a row. In the 29th match of the IPL on 7 May 2014 against Chennai Super Kings, Maxwell scored 90 runs off just 38 balls with 6 fours and 8 sixes and picked up the wicket of Suresh Raina while bowling, winning the Man of the Match award for the fourth time in the season. Punjab went on to post a massive score of 231, the highest innings score of season. In 16 games he had the season's 3rd highest aggregate of 552 runs at an average of 34.50.|$|R
