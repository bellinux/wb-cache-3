50|$|Many {{mechanics}} are {{specialized in}} a particular field, such as auto mechanics, truck mechanic, bicycle mechanics, motorcycle mechanics, boiler mechanics, general mechanics, industrial maintenance mechanics (millwrights), air conditioning and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>mechanics,</b> bus mechanics, aircraft mechanics, diesel mechanics, and tank mechanics in the armed services. Auto mechanics, for example, have many trades within. Some may specialize in the electrical aspects, while others may specialize in the mechanical aspects. Other areas include: brakes and steering, suspension, automatic or standard transmission, engine repairs, or diagnosing customer complaints. An automotive technician, on the other hand, has {{a wide variety of}} topics to learn. A mechanic is typically certified by a trade association or regional government power. Mechanics may be separated into two classes based on the type of machines that they work on: heavyweight and lightweight. Heavyweight work is on bigger machines, such as tractors and trailers; lightweight work on smaller items, like car engines.|$|R

50|$|In Australia, a {{journeyman}} registration {{allows the}} permit holder {{to work under}} {{the general direction of}} an advanced tradesman. A journeyman may oversee the work of apprentices and trades assistants buf may nor contract for work using that particular registration. A journeyman level qualification is obtained by completing a formal apprenticeship. An apprenticeship is learning a skilled trade under the supervision of an advanced tradesperson. An apprenticeis a trainee who is becoming formally trained and qualified in a particular type of trade. The duration of an apprenticeship is usually three to four years, depending on the individual trade. On completion of the training the apprentice will receive a nationally-recognised qualification, a Trade Certificate. Practical on-the-job learning makes up the majority of an apprenticeship, but it also incorporates some classroom learning. Apprenticeships offer real-life experience in the workplace, a regular income and new skills. Examples of licensed trades are plumbers and gas-fitters, electricians, air-conditioning and <b>refrigeration</b> <b>mechanics</b> and carpenters and joiners.|$|R
40|$|Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) have {{replaced}} the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in refrigeration installations and air-conditioning applications. As substitution progressed, some <b>refrigeration</b> <b>mechanics</b> experienced symptoms of inflammation. The new refrigerants were well studied in animals, but data on toxicology and toxicokinetics in humans were scarce. The aim of this thesis was to study human toxicokinetics and effects of HFC- 134 a and HFC- 143 a. Moreover, autoimmune responses due to exposure to halogenated hydrocarbons used as refrigerants were investigated and a case of myocardial infarction was discussed. Toxicokinetics and Effects (Study I and II) : Ten male volunteers were exposed to 500 ppm HFC- 134 a and/or HFC- 143 a in an exposure chamber (2 h, workload of 50 W). Blood, exhaled air, and urine were collected up to 19 h post-exposure and analysed for HFC with gas chromatography. The experimental data was described by a physiologically-based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model. Markers of inflammation (C‑reactive protein, serum amyloid A protein, D-dimer, fibrinogen) and uric acid were analysed in plasma collected before and 21 h post-exposure. The volunteers rated symptoms related to irritation and CNS-symptoms on a visual analogue scale before, during and after exposure. The increase in blood upon exposure to HFC was fast, and apparent steady-states (9. 4 µM for HFC- 134 a, 4. 8 µM for HFC 143 a) were reached within minutes. The post-exposure decrease in blood was fast as well and parallel to that of exhaled air. The urinary excretion of HFC‑ 134 a and HFC‑ 143 a was less than 0. 002 % of the inhaled amount with half-times of 58 and 53 min. The experimental data fitted well within a PBTK framework, and the relative respiratory uptake was estimated to 3. 7 % for HFC‑ 134 a and 1. 6 % for HFC- 143 a. No effect due to exposure was seen on symptom ratings or in the electrocardiographic recordings. Fibrinogen plasma concentration had increased after exposure to both HFCs, whereas {{none of the other}} inflammatory markers or uric acid had increased significantly. Further studies are needed to confirm or reject this finding. Autoimmune Response (Study III) : Serum samples from 44 Swedish men, occupationally exposed to refrigerants, were screened for antibodies against CYP 2 E 1 with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The men participating in the study were selected from a cohort of 280 <b>refrigeration</b> <b>mechanics.</b> One group comprised 30 men with asthma, joint or influenza-like symptoms and another exposed group comprised 14 men with no such symptoms. Unexposed, healthy subjects from Sweden (n= 35) and Italy (n= 26) constituted control groups. No increase in CYP 2 E 1 antibody titer was seen among occupationally exposed persons compared to unexposed controls. Neither were there any differences between exposed, symptomatic subjects and healthy exposed or unexposed ones. Further, no relation between antibody titer and severity of symptoms, smoking, inhaled anesthetics, age, or year in occupation was detected. Case Report (Study IV) : A case of myocardial infarction was reported. Possible associations between welding, exposure to decomposed HCFC- 22, respiratory symptoms and the myocardial infarction were discussed. In conclusion, the respiratory uptake of HFC- 134 a and HFC- 143 a is low and the post-exposure decrease in blood and exhaled air is fast. There may be an inflammatory response at 500 ppm exposure level (i. e. at the Swedish occupational exposure limit, 8 ‑h time-weighted average), but further studies are needed to confirm this response. Exposure to halogenated hydrocarbons could not be associated to CYP 2 E 1 -related autoimmunity...|$|R
