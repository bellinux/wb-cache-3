40|$|International audienceThe {{atmospheric}} oxidation of benzyl alcohol {{has been investigated}} using smog chambers at ICARE, FORD, and EUPHORE. The rate coefficient for reaction with OH radicals was measured and an upper limit for the reaction with ozone was established; kOH = (2. 8 ± 0. 4) × 10 - 11 at 297 ± 3 K (averaged value including results from Harrison and Wells) and kO 3 < 2 × 10 - 19 cm 3 molecule- 1 s- 1 at 299 K. The products of the OH radical initiated oxidation of benzyl alcohol {{in the presence of}} NOX were studied. Benzaldehyde, originating from H-abstraction from the −CH 2 OH group, was identified using in situ FTIR spectroscopy, HPLC-UV/FID, and GC-PID and quantified in a yield of (24 ± 5) %. <b>Ring</b> <b>retaining</b> products originating from OH-addition to the aromatic ring such as o-hydroxybenzylalcohol and o-dihydroxybenzene as well as ring-cleavage products such as glyoxal were also identified and quantified with molar yields of (22 ± 2) %, (10 ± 3) %, and (2. 7 ± 0. 7) %, respectively. Formaldehyde was observed with a molar yield of (27 ± 10) %. The results are discussed with respect to previous studies and the {{atmospheric oxidation}} mechanism of benzyl alcohol...|$|E
40|$|The Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) {{requested}} the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) to develop tooling {{and equipment to}} remotely replace gaskets in mechanical Hanford connectors to reduce personnel radiation exposure {{as compared to the}} current hands-on method. It is also expected that radiation levels will continually increase with future waste streams. The equipment is operated in the Remote Equipment Decontamination Cell (REDC), which is equipped with compressed air, two master-slave manipulators (MSM's) and an electro-mechanical manipulator (EMM) arm for operation of the remote tools. The REDC does not provide access to electrical power, so the equipment must be manually or pneumatically operated. The MSM's have a load limit at full extension of ten pounds, which limited the weight of the installation tool. In order to remotely replace Hanford connector gaskets several operations must be performed remotely, these include: removal of the spent gasket and retaining <b>ring</b> (<b>retaining</b> ring is also called snap ring), loading the new snap ring and gasket into the installation tool and installation of the new gasket into the Hanford connector. SRNL developed and tested tools that successfully perform all of the necessary tasks. Removal of snap rings from horizontal and vertical connectors is performed by separate air actuated retaining ring removal tools and is manipulated in the cell by the MSM. In order install a new gasket, the snap ring loader is used to load a new snap ring into a groove in the gasket installation tool. A new gasket is placed on the installation tool and retained by custom springs. An MSM lifts the installation tool and presses the mounted gasket against the connector block. Once the installation tool is in position, the gasket and snap ring are installed onto the connector by pneumatic actuation. All of the tools are located on a custom work table with a pneumatic valve station that directs compressed air to the desired tool and vents the tools as needed. Extensive testing of tooling operation was performed in the DWPF manipulator repair shop. This testing allowed the operators to gain confidence before the equipment was exposed to radioactive contamination. The testing also led to multiple design improvements. On July 17 and 29, 2008 the Remote Gasket Replacement Tooling was successfully demonstrated in the REDC at the DWPF of The Savannah River Site...|$|E

The experimental analysis, including the asymmetry in the zenithal distributions of the µ − type events in Super-Kamiokande gives a strong support to the neutrino oscillation hypothesis to solve the anomaly. In this work we are interested by the role of nuclear physics in the neutrino-oxygen reactions used to detect the atmospheric neutrinos.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{several studies}} relating to fundamental characterization of CMP consumables in planarization processes. These are also evaluated with {{the purposes of}} minimizing environmental impact and reducing cost of ownership (COO). The first study is conducted to obtain the <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> wear rate in a typical ILD CMP process and is specifically intended to investigate the effect of <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> materials and slot designs during the CMP process. The results show that <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> materials have effect on the COF, pad temperature and <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> wear rate, while <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> slot designs affect the pad surface abruptness. The second study is performed to compare the effect of different <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> slot designs on the slurry film thickness within the pad-wafer interface. A novel non-intrusive optical technique, dual emission UV-enhanced fluorescence (DEUVEF), was applied to accurately measure the film thickness of the slurry underneath the wafer during polishing. It is indicated that the optimized <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> slot design can significantly reduce the COO of CMP processes by increasing slurry utilization. A COF method is applied to measure the slurry mean residence time (MRT) during CMP. This technique uses transient COF data induced by a shift in slurry concentration to determine MRT. Variations in consumables as well as sliding velocity, pressure and slurry flow rate can affect the slurry MRT. One study in this dissertation focus {{on the effect of}} <b>retaining</b> <b>ring</b> slot designs on the slurry MRT. Another study compares the slurry MRT under same polishing conditions using pads with different groove width. Both studies are conducted on multiple sliding velocity, pressure and slurry flow rate variations to understand the characteristics of consumable designs. The method of measuring MRT during polishing presented in this dissertation can be easily applied in general CMP processes. The subsequent studies focus in the diamond conditioner discs characterization techniques. A newly developed method for determining active diamonds and aggressive diamonds on a diamond conditioner disc under a certain vertical load is elaborated in this dissertation. Later, this technique together with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging is implemented to analyze diamond pullout and fracture in CMP. Five different types of diamond conditioner discs are subjected to a novel accelerated wear test respectively to compare the extent of diamond pullout and fracture under the same conditioning conditio...|$|R

40|$|SummaryCytokinesis is {{accomplished}} by constriction of a cortical contractile ring. We show that during the early embryonic divisions in C. elegans, ring constriction occurs in two phases—an initial phase at a constant rate followed by a second phase during which the constriction rate decreases in proportion to ring perimeter. Cytokinesis completes in {{the same amount of}} time, despite the reduction in cell size during successive divisions, due to a strict proportionality between initial ring size and the constant constriction rate. During closure, the myosin motor in the ring decreases in proportion to perimeter without turning over. We propose a “contractile unit” model to explain how the <b>ring</b> <b>retains</b> a structural memory of its initial size as it disassembles. The scalability of constriction may facilitate coordination of mitotic events and cytokinesis when cell size, and hence the distance traversed by the ring, varies during embryogenesis and in other contexts...|$|R
40|$|Ring-shaped sliding clamps and {{clamp loader}} ATPases are {{essential}} factors for rapid and accurate DNA replication. The clamp ring is opened and resealed at the primer–template junctions by the ATP-fueled clamp loader function. The processivity of the DNA polymerase is conferred by its attachment to the clamp loaded onto the DNA. In eukarya and archaea, the replication factor C (RFC) and the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) play crucial roles as the clamp loader and the clamp, respectively. Here, we report the electron microscopic structure of an archaeal RFC–PCNA–DNA complex at 12 -Å resolution. This complex exhibits excellent fitting of each atomic structure of RFC, PCNA, and the primed DNA. The PCNA <b>ring</b> <b>retains</b> an open conformation by extensive interactions with RFC, with a distorted spring washer-like conformation.
