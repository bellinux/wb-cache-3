5|$|I think we’re {{going to}} have {{problems}} politically until we {{get some sort of}} third party movement or some voice out there that can put forth new ideas. Someone’s going to step up at some point and say we’ve had enough of this. The <b>real</b> <b>issues</b> are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.|$|E

25|$|Considering Kroupa and Fancher's {{backgrounds}} {{and the fact}} that MindVox employed a motley collection of convicted felons like security expert Len Rose and the infamous Phiber Optik (Mark Abene) who was awaiting a Manhattan grand jury indictment, these were very <b>real</b> <b>issues</b> at the time.|$|E
25|$|Taking a (what was {{becoming}} the traditional liberal) {{stance on the}} social issues of the day, Mondale advocated for gun control, {{the right to choose}} regarding abortion, and strongly opposed the repeal of laws regarding institutionalized prayer in public schools.

25|$|After {{his death}} his son-in-law, P. van Limburg Brouwer, a {{physician}} and writer, wrote a dull biography, but with some crucial details. The statesman J.R. Thorbecke in his Historische Schetsen ("Historical Sketches"), published in 1860, criticised the biographer, his subject and his florid jargon. Some authors regard Wiselius as forceful, sharp-witted, animated or even overstrung. Simon Schama hardly ever has a positive opinion of Wiselius and the Patriot brotherhood, describing them as only quasi-intellectual, and Wiselius himself as a minor figure, a Jacobin, a renegade and an over-loud, pessimistic drawing-room liberal who shirked <b>real</b> <b>issues,</b> and ended up leaving politics an embittered man.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} {{declaring that the}} fight was off, Arum {{had a change of}} heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it {{deadline}} to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to 3 tests—one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and one immediately after the fight: Let's be very clear on the <b>real</b> <b>issues</b> we differ on. It's not about being tested....It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures....The major issue related to the testing rests with which independent agency will administer these tests. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous.|$|E

500|$|Goldhagen, who {{acknowledged}} that the photo wrongly identified the figure and location, described the lawsuit as a crude diversionary tactic to displace focus from the <b>real</b> <b>issues.</b> Goldhagen stated that the photograph was misidentified by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, from which the picture was obtained. Religious commentator and former priest Paul Collins characterized the mislabeling of the photograph as inexcusable, while The New York Times reported that most historians agreed that [...] "a single mislabeled photo in a 346-page book is a minor error." ...|$|E

50|$|Much {{controversy}} rages {{about the}} benefits produced by entrepreneurship. But the <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> is about how well institutions they operate in (markets, planning, bureaucracies, government) serve the public.

500|$|Similarly, Clara Bow's {{speaking}} {{voice was}} sometimes {{blamed for the}} demise of her Hollywood career, though the <b>real</b> <b>issues</b> involved her clashes with studio executives and what film historian David Thomson describes as the [...] "backlash of bourgeois hypocrisy" [...] against a lifestyle {{that would have been}} unremarkable for a male star. Buster Keaton was eager to explore the new medium, but when his studio, MGM, made the changeover to sound, he was quickly stripped of creative control. Though a number of Keaton's early talkies made impressive profits, they were artistically dismal.|$|E
500|$|The U.S. population's {{perception}} of Black Lives Matter varies considerably by race. According to a September 2015 poll on race relations, {{nearly two-thirds of}} African Americans mostly agree with Black Lives Matter, while 42% of white Americans are unsure or {{do not have an}} opinion about Black Lives Matter. Of white people surveyed, 41% thought that Black Lives Matter advocated violence, and 59% of whites thought that Black Lives Matter distracted attention from the <b>real</b> <b>issues</b> of racial discrimination. By comparison, 82% of black people polled thought that Black Lives Matter was a nonviolent movement, and 26% of blacks thought that Black Lives Matter distracted attention from the <b>real</b> <b>issues</b> of racial discrimination. On the question of whether [...] "Black Lives Matter" [...] was mostly a movement or mostly a slogan, 46% of whites and 67% of blacks thought that it is mostly a movement. A similar poll in June 2016 found that 65% of black American adults supported Black Lives Matter and 40% of white American adults support it. Fifty-nine percent of black Americans thought that Black Lives Matter would [...] "be effective, in the long run, in helping blacks achieve equality" [...] and 34% of white Americans thought so. A 2017 Harvard-Harris survey found that 35% of whites and 83% of blacks have a favorable view of the movement.|$|E

[...] He informs us of <b>real</b> <b>issues</b> we otherwise wouldn't hear or think deeply about, which in and of itself is brilliant, but what really sets him apart is his way of calling his audience to action about these issues.
