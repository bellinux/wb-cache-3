50|$|Caldillo de congrio (Spanish for Cusk-eel stock) is a Chilean fish dish. The dish {{is made of}} congrio Dorado (pink cusk-eel) or Colorado (<b>red</b> <b>cusk-eel),</b> a cusk-eel species {{common in}} the Chilean Sea. The dish is made by boiling {{together}} fish heads, onion, garlic, coriander, carrots and pepper. Once these are boiled, only the stock is used. Onion and garlic are fried together with chopped tomatoes. The vegetables are mixed then with the stock, cream, boiled potatoes and marinated and boiled conger.|$|E

Teleosts {{exhibit a}} broad {{divergence}} in their adaptive response to stress, {{depending on the}} magnitude, duration, and frequency of stressors and the species receiving the stimulus. We have previously reported that the <b>red</b> <b>cusk-eel</b> (Genypterus chilensis), an important marine farmed fish, shows a physiological response to stress that results in increased skeletal muscle atrophy mediated by over-expression of components of the ubiquitin proteasome and autophagy-lysosomal systems. To better understand the systemic effects of stress on the <b>red</b> <b>cusk-eel</b> metabolism, the present study assessed the transcriptomic hepatic response to repetitive handling-stress. Using high-Throughput RNA-seq, 259 up-regulated transcripts were found, mostly associated with angiogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and triacylglyceride catabolism. Conversely, 293 transcripts were down-regulated, associated to cholesterol biosynthesis, PPARα signaling, fatty acid biosynthesis, and glycolysis. This gene signature was concordant with hepatic metabolite levels and hepatic oxidative damage. Moreover, the increased plasmatic levels of AST (aspartate aminotransferase), ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and AP (alkaline phosphatase), as well as liver histology suggest stress-induced liver steatosis. This study offers an integrative molecular and biochemical analysis of the hepatic response to handling-stress, and reveals unknown aspects of lipid metabolism in a non-model teleost. [URL]...|$|E

Although most fish follow a conserved pattern of stress response, with increased concentrations of cortisol, each species presents specificities {{in the cell}} response and stress tolerance. Therefore, culturing new species requires a detailed knowledge of these specific responses. The <b>red</b> <b>cusk-eel</b> (Genypterus chilensis) is a new economically important marine species for the Chilean aquaculture industry. However, there is no information on the stress-and cortisol-induced mechanisms that decrease skeletal muscle growth in this teleost. Results: Using Illumina RNA-seq technology, skeletal muscle sequence reads for G. chilensis were generated under control and handling stress conditions. Reads were mapped onto a reference transcriptome, resulting in the in silico identification of 785 up-regulated and 167 down-regulated transcripts. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed a significant upregulation of catabolic genes associated with skeletal muscle atrophy. These results were validated by RT-qPCR analysis for ten candidates genes involved in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, autophagy and skeletal muscle growth. Additionally, using a primary culture of fish skeletal muscle cells, the effect of cortisol was evaluated in relation to <b>red</b> <b>cusk-eel</b> skeletal muscle atrophy. Conclusions: The present data demonstrated that handling stress promotes skeletal muscle atrophy in the marine teleost G. chilensis through the expression of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome systems. Furthermore, cortisol was a powerful inductor of skeletal muscle atrophy in fish myotubes. This study {{is an important step}} towards understanding the atrophy system in non-model teleost species and provides novel insights on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control skeletal muscle growth in early vertebrates.
