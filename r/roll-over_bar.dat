50|$|There was {{no longer}} any sign of the coach built {{cabriolet}} conversion that had been offered for earlier Rekords. Karl Deutsch who had provided cabriolet conversions of the Opel Rekord C ceased operations in 1971 as cabriolet conversions fell out of favour in anticipation of safety legislation in North America requiring stout, costly and inelegant <b>roll-over</b> <b>bars</b> on cabriolets.|$|R

5000|$|Chapter 3 {{documents}} {{the history of}} crash science focusing on {{the effect on the}} human body (the second collision) as it collides with the interior of the car as the car hits another object (the first collision). Nader says that much knowledge was available to designers by the early 1960s but it was largely ignored within the American automotive industry. There are in-depth discussions about the steering assembly, instrument panel, windshield, passenger restraint, and the passenger compartment (which included everything from door strength to <b>roll-over</b> <b>bars).</b> Due to this, the [...] "Nader bolt" [...] was installed to reinforce the door and suicide doors were discontinued {{because of a lack of}} door strength.|$|R
5000|$|The Peugeot Hoggar was {{a concept}} car {{produced}} by Peugeot. It was a two-seater off-road vehicle, powered by two diesel engines {{that drove the}} front and rear wheels in a four wheel drive configuration. The car principally consisted of a one-piece carbon honeycomb body reinforced by two upper longitudinal <b>roll-over</b> <b>bars</b> completed from stainless steel, each with a diameter of 76 mm. These tubes also served as an air intake and air conduit to the front engine (left-hand tube) and rear engine (right-hand tube). Both engines displaced 2168 cc and produced power of around [...] The two engines consequently supplied a collective power of nearly [...] and a maximum torque of 800 Nm.|$|R
50|$|The Eagle's {{wedge-shaped}} {{body was}} designed by Aldo Brovarone, who drew inspiration from the sports prototype cars {{of the time and}} the Alfa Romeo 33/TT/12 in particular. The body was characterized by a prominent rearward-inclined or swept-back <b>roll-over</b> <b>bar.</b> The interior diverged strongly from the contemporary Alfa style, with soft matte plastic dashboard finishes, a mono-spoke steering wheel and fully digital instrumentation.|$|E
50|$|Designed in 1984, the R129 {{was based}} on the {{shortened}} floorpan of the Mercedes-Benz W124 and featured many innovative details for the time, for instance electronically controlled damping (Adaptive Damping System ADS, optional) and a hidden, automatically extending <b>roll-over</b> <b>bar.</b> The R107's somewhat dated rear suspension with semi-trailing arms gave way to a modern multi-link axle. The number of standard features was high, with electric action for the windows, mirrors, seats and hydraulic convertible top.|$|E
5000|$|A {{police car}} was created {{based on the}} ABT R8 GTR vehicle, which is itself a {{modified}} version of Audi R8 Coupé 5.2 FSI quattro.

50|$|A {{cabriolet}} version was also available. Based on the Rekord C coupé, {{this was a}} coach-built conversion produced by the body builders Karl Deutsch. The approach made them very much more expensive than other cars in the range: the cabriolet cost DM 4,000 more than the coupé on which it was based. Not many Rekord C cabriolets were sold, amid increasing concerns, during the later 1960s, that open topped cars (without <b>roll-over</b> <b>bars)</b> might be more dangerous {{in the event of}} a crash than cars with fixed roofs. An alternative cabriolet conversion, based on the Rekord C 2-door sedan, was developed by Karmann of Osnabrück. This never went into anything approaching volume production, although four pre-production examples are believed still to survive.|$|R
5000|$|Although it was rumoured by the {{automotive}} press since {{the announcement of}} the production R8 in 2006, it was only in August 2008 that spy shots of a convertible R8 [...] "Spider" [...] from filming scenes of the movie Iron Man 2 were published online. The photos showed a clearly visible [...] "soft-top" [...] roof, and the distinctive [...] "sideblade" [...] had been removed. The vehicle was formally unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show. Compared with the coupé model, the convertible had extra chassis support, a pair of <b>roll-over</b> safety <b>bars,</b> as well as minor changes such as the location of the fuel filler. It was powered by the uneven firing 5.2 FSI V10 engine.|$|R
5000|$|The SLS AMG Roadster is a {{convertible}} version of SLS AMG Coupé, with conventional doors, three-layered fabric soft top (in magnesium/steel/aluminium construction) that opens and closes in 11 seconds, {{and can be}} operated on the move at up to 50 kph mph.

50|$|The new VW Golf Cabriolet's styling {{follows that}} of its {{hard-top}} three-door counterpart, but it differs somewhat with a new rear section, lower profile roof line and more swept-back angle of its front windscreen frame. Bi-xenon headlights are an option. Unlike the regular Golf, the Cabriolet has LED rear lights, which are only available for the R and GTI versions of the hardtop. Safety features include the automatically deploying <b>roll-over</b> <b>bar,</b> front airbags, side head/thorax airbags, knee airbag for the driver and ESP.|$|E

5000|$|The next version to be {{launched}} was a two-door convertible called the Spyder (or Zagato in America), also with 2+2 seating. In brochures Lancia spelt the name with a [...] "y" [...] rather than an [...] "i" [...] possibly to differentiate the car from the Alfa Romeo Spider. The Spyder used the coupé's shorter wheelbase and featured a targa top roof panel, a <b>roll-over</b> <b>bar</b> and folding rear roof. Early models {{did not have a}} cross-member supporting the roof between the tops of the A to B Pillars. Later models had fixed cross-members. It was initially powered by either the 1600 or 1800 twin-cam engine, later being replaced by the new 1.6 and 2.0. It never received the IE or VX engines. There were fuel injected engines for the US market. The Spyder was designed by Pininfarina but actually built by Zagato. The construction process was complex, with coupé bodies-in-white being delivered to Zagato for the roofless conversion, then back to Lancia for rust-proofing, then back to Zagato for paint, interior and trim, and then back to Lancia for a third time for engine installation and final assembly. Lancia probably lost money on every car built. Number built: 9390.|$|E

40|$|Conventional {{methods for}} {{light-weight}} design {{in mechanical engineering}} come to a limit and new approaches have to be investigated to achieve higher weight savings in components and products. In this thesis two load-carrying body sections of a bus are being developed with a biomimicry lightweight approach in cooperation with two industrial partners. Premium AEROTEC, {{as one of the}} industrial part- ners, determined the production technologies and material. The production meth- ods are an automated fibre placement machine and resin transfer molding with the determined material carbon fibre reinforced plastic. The given manufacturing pro- cesses and material delimit the design structure. To solve this problem the ELiSE process from imare GmbH is being used. It starts with an analysis of the Neoplan Cityliner C which was provided by the second industrial partner MAN Truck & Bus AG as a reference model. Then paragons like diatoms, radiolara, origami and others are searched for to create design concepts for a load-carrying bus structure. Two concepts, which shall replace the bus section where the front <b>roll-over</b> <b>bar</b> is located, are chosen for a topology optimization and a parametric evolutionary al- gorithm with the finite element method. Two modelled body sections are present- ed, one ending up having a higher structural weight than the reference model and one having a weight saving potential up to 50...|$|E
