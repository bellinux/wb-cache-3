40|$|The authors {{make two}} distinct, but related, arguments. First, their {{empirical}} studies - conducted in three antenatal clinics in inner-city Johannesburg - demonstrate {{a strong correlation}} between (1) the government's failure to provide adequate remuneration to and secure employment of lay counsellors for the provision of HIV counseling and treatment and (2) the failure of many women and children to receive timely medical interventions. The data show that late payment of HIV lay counsellors has a devastating impact on HIV testing in these three clinics. The evidence also demonstrates that such timely HIV prevention and treatment is required for the survival of pregnant women and their neonates. Lay counsellors - through no fault of their own - are often unable to make these timely interventions. Second, the authors contend that the government's conscious deployment of inadequately remunerated and institutionally marginalized lay counsellors instead of health care professionals (who had previously undertaken counselling and testing) constitutes a <b>retrogressive</b> <b>measure</b> in terms of s 27 of the Constitution. In short, despite the government's commitment to an expanded, more efficacious ART rollout, it is currently delivering less health care - not more - and less access to adequate health care - not more or better - to this cohort of patients with HIV. Such retrogressive measures offend the Court's own understanding of the delivery of this constitutionally-mandated public good to pregnant women with HIV and their infants. The failure of the government to provide adequate and timely remuneration and secure employment to lay counsellors rises to the level required for finding an unjustifiable limitation of s 27 's right of access to health care services. As the authors show, the violation flows from the improperly remunerated, insufficiently trained and generally marginalized manner in which lay counsellors are (mis) managed by a public health system that has chosen to supplant well-trained professionals with well-intentioned non-professionals in the delivery of essential components of now constitutionally-mandated ART and PMTCT programme...|$|E

40|$|Social {{rights are}} {{guaranteed}} in Hong Kong under the constitutional document, the Basic Law, {{as well as}} the ICESCR as applied to Hong Kong. The adjudication of social rights in the domestic court attracts very different dynamics when compared to civil and political rights. While the court is vigilant in safeguarding civil and political rights of residents, judicial attitude has been more cautious in relation to social rights. Social rights have been classified as aspirational, promotional and are regarded as competing rights. Their delicate balance and advancement is best to be dealt with by the government, as the court positions herself as a secondary agent, overseeing at a distant level and granting high degree of deference and discretion to the administration. The idea of social right as a right enforceable by the court is weak. Recent adjudication in Hong Kong often evolves around the <b>retrogressive</b> <b>measures</b> by the government to limit social benefits which citizens used to enjoy, and the failure by the government to realize social rights on the ground of insufficient resources. This paper will study the concepts of <b>retrogressive</b> <b>measures</b> and the limitation of social rights, in search for a principled approach to tackle the controversies. It will look at the realm of legitimate measures by the government in light of its constitutional duty to advance social rights, and the appropriate level of review by the judiciary on these matters. Reference will be drawn from comparative jurisprudence and the international standards on the protection of social rights...|$|R
40|$|This {{negative}} image of lawyers as a dishonest profession which feeds on the innocent's miseries {{is almost as}} old as the legal profession and has sometimes resulted in shortsighted, emotional and <b>retrogressive</b> <b>measures</b> against the legal profession such as its abolition in France soon after the 1789 Revolution and in Russia {{in the aftermath of the}} 1917 Socialist Revolution. In contrast to the above perceptions, lawyers often see themselves and their profession as custodians of every society's civilisation. For example, Justice Maugham has argued that "lawyers are the custodians of civilisations than which there can be no higher aim and nobler duty".

25|$|Thus his raid upon Dobrzyń, {{the latest}} {{acquisition}} of the knights on Polish soil, speedily gave them a ready weapon against him. The Prussian bishops, who were devoted to the knights, questioned the authority of Gediminas letters and denounced him as {{an enemy of the}} faith at a synod in Elbing; his Orthodox subjects reproached him with leaning towards the Latin heresy, while the pagan Lithuanians accused him of abandoning the ancient gods. Gediminas disentangled himself from his difficulties by repudiating his former promises; by refusing to receive the papal legates who arrived at Riga in September 1323, and by dismissing the Franciscans from his territories. These apparently <b>retrogressive</b> <b>measures</b> simply amounted to a statesmanlike recognition {{of the fact that the}} pagan element was still the strongest force in Lithuania, and could not yet be dispensed with in the coming struggle for nationality.|$|R
30|$|In addition, the Committee has {{suggested}} that the notion of progressive realisation makes it extremely cumbersome for states to justify any <b>retrogressive</b> <b>measures.</b> 17 The extent to which this would also hold true during armed conflicts, during which time resources may need to be redistributed, is unclear. However, it may be deduced that at least the minimum core of subsistence rights may not be derogated from, even during situations of public emergency threatening the life of the nation. This conclusion is particularly significant when viewed in light of the below discussion on the absence of human rights obligations for NSAGs. If subsistence rights were derogable, it would mean that the obligations on the state and NSAGs would be more equal and would provide some level of justification for the fact that individuals’ rights were not being realised.|$|R

40|$|Is it true that, {{before the}} recent {{cases that are}} said to have redefined its path, Canadian {{copyright}} law was missing a purpose? This article presents an alternative view, based on domestic and international human rights law. It argues that the recent “upbringing” of users’ rights in Canada in reality reflects the implicit entrenchment of the so-called human right of access to knowledge in the domestic legal system. The article starts with a critical analysis of Canadian copyright case law, presenting some unsuspected problems in what the scholarly literature calls “the trilogy” – the group of cases that is believed to have unveiled the principle of balance in Canadian copyright law. It calls for an integral approach to users’ rights, which does not ignore the complex fabric of decisions that provides for the internalization of international human rights in Canadian law. Arguing that the Supreme Court of Canada should explicitly acknowledge this relation, the article sketches a framework for understanding how a human right of access to knowledge, if present in the international human rights system, would also be found within Canadian law itself. Finally, the article denies the supposed human rights nature of copyright, and, conversely, argues that several different instruments within the United Nations system provide solid grounds for grasping the existence of a human right of access to knowledge. Understanding, that users’ rights are human rights has important implications for copyright policy. The most important of all is the presumption against <b>retrogressive</b> <b>measures,</b> which would oblige those who push the ongoing process of copyright reform in this country to prove that any additional layer of protection would be legitimate within a human rights context. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|The {{right to}} enjoy the {{benefits}} of scientific progress and its applications (REBSP) is still, despite increased attention from United Nations (UN) human rights bodies and academics, very much unknown. Several studies and reports have been elaborated on the normative content and State obligations of this right, {{but one of the}} legal aspects that has not yet been fully explored is possible limitations. The REBSP is, just as most other human rights in international law, not absolute. States may, under certain circumstances, limit this right. This article analyses the legal framework of limitations of the REBSP, based on the different regimes in international human rights law. The possibility of and criteria for limitations are laid down in treaty provisions, so-called limitation clauses. Relevant to limitations clauses is the more general doctrine of State obligations, which {{in the case of the}} REBSP is characterized by the regime of progressive realization of this right and the prohibition of <b>retrogressive</b> <b>measures.</b> Another legal regime that is very relevant to the limitation of the right {{to enjoy the}} benefits of scientific progress is that of intellectual property (IP). While author’s rights and IP rights in general are possible means to limit the right to enjoy the benefits of science, a detailed discussion of the intellectual property regime, which is mostly developed outside the international human rights law framework, falls outside the scope of this contribution and is dealt with by other authors in this journal. This article focuses on the general legal human rights framework of limitations of the right to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress, including the criteria to take such measures...|$|R
