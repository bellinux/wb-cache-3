40|$|The {{ability of}} a {{regional}} system to generate human capital is crucial, {{but it is not}} a sufficient condition leading to economic success. In this work we emphasise the importance of maintaining and attracting highly skilled and educated individuals and the challenges that migration flows pose on policymaking aimed at fostering human capital accumulation in peripheral regions. We employ a unique data set generated through a postal survey designed and conducted by the authors. The focus of our analysis is on the micro-level location decisions of a sample of highly educated and skilled individuals residing in a small peripheral Italian Mezzogiorno <b>region</b> (<b>Basilicata)</b> who have benefited from a locally funded human capital investment policy. In particular we shed light on the following questions: (1) Who are the migrants?; (2) Which are the main factors influencing migration of talented individuals?; (3) Which are the factors which make a region attractive for those individuals? The sample under analysis is a natural experiment for assessing both the effectiveness of locally financed human capital investment policy and the factors affecting the location decision of highly educated individuals in an economy presenting all the features of a core-periphery structure...|$|E
40|$|In {{some paper}} whose {{aim is to}} detect the model of {{sustainable}} development, it is simple {{to note that the}} actual models present in the System of national Accounts (SEC, SNA), are not able to give the ecessary information about the relation between economy and environment. The main approaches in this field such as SEEA, NAMEA, SERIEE, SIP, still present problems as the difficulties to make a good classification, and to attribute the different types of pollution to the economic factor of pressure. This paper shows a statistical approach finalized to a partial solution of these problems. In particular, it is analysed an Italian <b>region</b> (<b>Basilicata)</b> with sufficient environmental statistical information about one kind of pollution. The aim is to make some statistic multivariate analyses of territorial typizations, of the variability of the observed phenomenon of different kinds of the pollution existing in the territory and finally, of the procedure to identify the economic variables of pressure. The results are encouraging in giving new possibilities to analyse pollution problem with a new approach (whereas in past, the dates were analysed only with the threshold value of the single monitored variables). This is useful both for the building up of integrate model of "economic and environmental National Accounts" and for the individualization of relations between economic and antropic activity and the respective environmental output...|$|E

40|$|Autism is a neurodevelopmental {{disorder}} with onset in {{the first}} three years of life. It occurs with an alteration of social interaction, communication and behavior. Autism can be considered a disease of emerging social interest, particularly for economic and social issues of affected children and their families, and for an increasing incidence. For this study, we have submitted an anamnestic questionnaire to 29 autistic children and their families in a South Italy <b>region</b> (<b>Basilicata),</b> collecting data about children and their parents. The aim of this work is to study the association between autism and risk factors for specific familiar diseases and developmental disease in the early years of life, through a medical social investigation. The results show that many children have a family history of autoimmune diseases (psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease, Takayasu's arteritis), allergies and food intolerances, suggesting a putative involvement of the immune system in autism etiopathogenesis. Analyzing residence’s areas of patients, Potenza and Matera, with their environmental factors (radioactive waste repositories, incinerators, intensive farming), we demonstrate that the particular territorial characteristics don’t affect autism. Autistic disorder is a spectrum of neurologic disorders complex both in etiopathogenesis and healthcare. So we aim to continue the study already undertaken on cytokines of autistic subjects serum and to extend it through biomolecular approaches assessing the presence of specific genetic polymorphisms in order to identify the physiopathogenetic mechanisms underlying the disease and to evaluate the predictive risk with the aim to improve care interventions...|$|E
40|$|Initial {{measurements}} of black carbon (BC) content at both 880 and 370 nm, obtained in two sites in southern Italy by an aethalometer, have been analyzed. The sites {{are located in}} the same <b>region</b> (<b>Basilicata),</b> but are affected by different emission sources. In one case the main source of BC is related to vehicular traffic from a nearby freeway. Data were collected, although not continuously, during 2008, 2009 and 2010. In the second case, a fresh crude-oil pre-treatment plant continuously burns petroleum-derived products, thus contributing to emissions of both carbonaceous matter and its organic component. The corresponding data-set was collected in the period January–April 2011. At the first site, two daily peaks were found for the BC content, typical of vehicles emissions, with maximum values ranging from 2000 ng/m 3 to 4700 ng/m 3 found during weekdays. This behavior disappears at the weekend or when polluted air-masses from north-east Europe are transported over the measurement site. At the second site, two daily peaks were never found, suggesting that crude oil chemical processes were the main source of the emissions. In this case, the maximum BC values ranged between 1000 – 8000 ng/m 3, depending on the processes occurring at the fresh crude-oil pre-treatment plant. Moreover, the estimated level of BC at 370 nm was higher than that of BC at 880 nm in all months, expect for April, indicating a clear organic component in atmospheric aerosols. Finally, based on a best-fit procedure applied to the seven wavelengths’ absorption coefficients, aerosols with different spectroscopic properties have been detected at these two sites...|$|E

40|$|Climate {{changes such as}} the increase, in {{intensity}} and frequency, of extreme phenomena - hurricanes, thunder storms, flooding, drought -, of temperature and of biodiversity loss can influence land morphogenetic processes and prime a severe decreasing of natural resources such as the desertification. Desertification, that is the progressive loss of large areas of globe removed from human activities, {{is one of the}} most urgent problems in the last decades and is a phenomenon occurring on the most part of Mediterranean countries, such as Italy and in particular its Southern area. The most interested areas and regions are: Sicily, Sardinia, Pelage island, Pantelleria, Egadi island, Ustica, Calabria and Basilicata. The National Action Plane against Desertification (in Italian PAN) calls for synergy between resources and expertises of Basilicata Regional Office, APAT, ARPAB and research organizations for monitoring the Desertification Status Indicators. ARPAB monitoring Section developed a project to monitor indices and indicators. In this project, we focused on climatology, that is the study of climate and its variability; in particular we characterized rainfalls regimes, homogeneous rainfall areas and extreme rainfall events. Until now, this study produced historical trends of temperature and rainfall, and maps of indicators of desertification, in particular annual maps of aridity, and monthly and quarterly maps of drought. The analysis of the thematic maps of precipitation, drought and aridity gave us the possibility of evaluating the <b>Region</b> <b>Basilicata</b> tendency to the desertification phenomenon and, in particular, by considering the climatic and morphological variability. Concerning the observation periods (80 years of precipitations, 10 years of aridity, last 3 years of drought data) the region susceptibility to drought and aridity is higher in the NW and SE areas as compared to the Apennine areas on the NE-SW direction...|$|E
40|$|The Garden Care {{research}} project {{was meant to}} promote the innovation of environmental practices in primary school, within the theoretical framework of an “ecological pedagogy” (Mortari, 2011), phenomenologically oriented to environmental protection. 6 out of the 12 classes of first and second year of primary school {{involved in the project}} were from <b>region</b> <b>Basilicata.</b> The primary purpose of the project was to allow children to rediscover, in the formal places of education, the informal practices of work connected to the sustainable culture of gardening, which have long been experimented in the UK and the USA. The secondary purpose was to experiment the autobiographic approach (Demetrio, 1996, 1998, 2003 ¸ Cambi, 2002) in teaching environmental subjects, focusing on the connection between taking care of the plants/taking care of the others and the writing of the cure. Within this theoretical reference framework, the cooperative research consisted of two phases: environmental “live” teaching in gardens and environmental reflexive teaching. In the live teaching phase the gardening setting was set for educational activities to be carried on throughout a whole term. In the second phase of reflexive teaching the dialectic connection between gardening culture and autobiographic narration was brought out, with the intervention of the research group and using autobiographic writing as a mediator. Several analogies between the language of nature, the language of body and the language of self-care were pointed out throughout this phase. Several texts focusing on the relationship between care of the body and care of the plants were produced. Autobiographic writing “gave word” to experience crating that Self-Other-Earth circle that produced relevant effects during the process of environmental learning. Partial results of the project, still presently in progress, will be presented at the Congress...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of human capital {{as a key}} source of value added, innovation and economic growth is widely acknowledged by both economists and policy-makers. Local governments can directly affect individuals 2 ̆ 019 decision making by subsidising human capital formation. The ability of a regional system to generate human capital is crucial {{but it is not}} a sufficient condition leading to economic success. In this work we emphasise the {{importance of}} maintaining and attracting high-skilled individuals, and the challenge that migration flows pose on policymaking aimed at fostering human capital accumulation. Human capital does not always benefits the region where it was funded and the scope for the policy might vanish if the human capital formed locally is lost through migration, as emphasised by the 2 ̆ 01 cbrain drain 2 ̆ 01 d literature. When agglomeration forces are at work, human capital migrates from where it is scarce to where it is abundant, rather than vice versa (Lucas 1988). This can result in migration widening the regional wage and income gap and lowering the standard of living in the peripheral location. Poor regions lose through migration their most valuable residents, the main source of innovation and productivity in a modern economy. This phenomenon contributes in explaining the persistent nature of regional economic imbalances. These consideration are highlighted through the analysis of a case study, the migration decision of a sample of highly educated and skilled individuals residing in a small peripheral Mezzogiorno <b>region</b> (<b>Basilicata)</b> which have benefited from a locally funded human capital investment policy. The regional policymakers, in recognition of the importance of human capital as a key ingredient for regional growth, have given generous subsidies since the beginning of the 90 s to young graduates who wanted to attend a post-graduate course outside or inside the region. More than a thousand individuals have benefited from the policy in the last decade, and the target for the period 2000 - 2006 is to subsidise an additional two thousand individuals. A dataset was generated through a survey questionnaire which aims at directly asking people about their decision whether or not to move and the main factors influencing their decision. For each individual, we have collected data on background, experience and outcome of higher education, opinion on the quality of the course attended, job-search strategy after the course, and space-time career details from the first employment to the current employment status. The policy intervention under scrutiny and in particular the biased nature of the sample (highly skilled and educated individuals) makes the analysis a natural experiment for assessing the ability of the regional system in a peripheral EU region not only to generate human capital but also to maintain it. The focus of the paper is on the micro level migratory behaviour. In particular, we want to shed light on the following questions: (1) Who are the migrants; (2) What are the main factors influencing migration; (3) What is the resulting 2 ̆ 01 cgeography 2 ̆ 01 d of the human capital generated? Is the human capital attracted toward core regions...|$|E
