25|$|Because Indian casinos pose {{a threat}} to the Non-Indian casinos, a {{gambling}} competition has developed between the two kinds of casinos. Such high-stakes gambling in tribal areas and tax-exempt policy give Indian casinos great advantages in this competition. Consequently, Non-Indian casinos have lobbied the government to strengthen the <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> of the states toward Indian gaming.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the Quarter's cheap rents and air of decay {{attracted}} a bohemian artistic community, a trend which became {{pronounced in the}} 1920s. Many of these new inhabitants were active in the first preservation efforts in the Quarter, which began around that time. As a result, the Vieux Carré Commission (VCC) was established in 1925. Although initially only an advisory body, a 1936 referendum to amend the Louisiana constitution afforded it a measure of <b>regulatory</b> <b>power.</b> It began to exercise more power in the 1940s to preserve and protect the district.|$|E

25|$|The SWANCC {{decision}} {{continues the}} efforts of the five Supreme Court justices generally regarded as conservative to limit federal <b>regulatory</b> <b>power.</b> In 1995 and 2000, the same five justices found that Congress had exceeded Commerce Clause limits in enacting legislation dealing with possession of guns in school zones and violence against women. To be sure, the Supreme Court in SWANCC did not reach the constitutional question, but rather disposed of the case on purely statutory grounds. Nonetheless, its analysis of the CWA has, as noted, a strong undercurrent of the same Commerce Clause and federalism concerns. In not addressing the constitutional issue, SWANCC resembles another recent Commerce Clause decision in which, as in SWANCC, the Court used the possibility of Commerce Clause issues being raised by a broad interpretation of a federal statute to support its adoption of a narrow reading. The Court did not grant a petition for certiorari in a similar Commerce Clause challenge to the Endangered Species Act.|$|E
25|$|Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942), was a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} that dramatically increased the <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> {{of the federal}} government. It remains {{as one of the}} most important and far-reaching cases concerning the New Deal, and set a precedent for an expansive reading of the United States Constitution's Commerce Clause for decades to come. The goal of the business interests that financed the legal challenge all the way to the Supreme Court was to convince the court to declare the entire federal crop support program unconstitutional and thereby end it. Unfortunately for Filburn and his backers, by the time the case reached the high court, eight out of the nine justices had been appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the architect of the New Deal legislation. In addition, the case was heard during wartime, shortly after the United States had entered World War II. Not surprisingly, the Filburn decision supported the president's policy, holding that the Constitution allowed the federal government to regulate economic activity that was only indirectly related to interstate commerce.|$|E
25|$|Although {{individual}} U.S. {{states have}} the primary <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> {{with regard to}} marriage, the United States Congress has occasionally regulated marriage. The 1862 Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act, which made bigamy a punishable federal offense in U.S. territories, {{was followed by a}} series of federal laws designed to end the practice of polygamy. In 1996 as a reaction to a state level judicial ruling prohibiting same-sex couples from marrying that may violate Hawaii's constitutional equal protection clause (Baehr v. Miike, 80 Hawai`i 341), Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), section 3 of which defined marriage as a legal union of one man and one woman for the purpose of interpreting federal law. Under DOMA section 3, the federal government did not recognize same-sex marriages, even if those unions were recognized by state law. For example, members of a same-sex couple legally married in Massachusetts could not file joint federal income tax returns even if they filed joint state income tax returns. DOMA section 3 was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in United States v. Windsor on June 26, 2013.|$|E

500|$|The {{problems}} of industrial unrest continued to flare up, and the waterfront remained a flashpoint. In {{a review of}} the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1928, Bruce required industrial courts to consider the economic effects of its awards in addition to the welfare of worker. Immediate problems followed when a new award for waterside workers in 1928 worsened conditions for workers on economic grounds. New industrial action led by the Waterside Workers Federation broke out. In Melbourne these turned to riots, claiming casualties and at least one fatality. Reviving the [...] "red scare" [...] pitch for the 1928 election campaign, Bruce pushed the Transport Workers Act through parliament in response, which gave the executive unprecedented <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> in industrial relations. All waterfront workers now required federal licenses, or [...] "dog collars" [...] as they were derisively known, to work. The act allowed the Commonwealth government to effectively control who worked on the docks and nearly destroyed the Waterside Workers Federation, earning the government deep unpopularity among organised labour.|$|E
500|$|In April 1938, {{the network}} picked up The Green Hornet from former member WXYZ. Mutual gave the twice-a-week series its first {{national}} exposure until November 1939, when it switched to NBC Blue. (The series would return very briefly to Mutual {{in the fall}} of 1940). Mutual also provided the national launching pad for Kay Kyser and his Kollege of Musical Knowledge. Kyser's enormous success at Mutual soon allowed his show to move to NBC and its much larger audience. By May 1939, Mutual was broadcasting the Indianapolis 500. That autumn, Mutual won exclusive broadcast rights to the World Series. As described in a 1943 Supreme Court ruling upholding the <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> of the Federal Communications Commission, Mutual [...] "offered this program of outstanding national interest to stations throughout the country, including NBC and CBS affiliates in communities having no other stations. CBS and NBC immediately invoked the 'exclusive affiliation' clauses of their agreements with these stations, and as a result thousands of persons in many sections of the country were unable to hear the broadcasts of the games."

40|$|The {{principle}} of mutual recognition is almost universally acclaimed for removing barriers to trade, for enabling regulatory competition, and for preserving scope for regulatory autonomy instead of {{embarking on a}} path to harmonisation and centralisation. By using economic theories of legal federalism and regulatory competition, this paper shows that mutual recognition leads {{to a number of}} inconsistencies, which question its suitability as a conflict of law rule that guarantees a stable allocation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> within a two-level system of regulations. Mutual recognition should be understood more as a dynamic principle, which triggers a reallocation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> between different jurisdictional levels. It leads either back to the country of destination principle, to a free market for regulations, or to harmonisation. The European experience suggests that a regime of mutual recognition is primarily another path to convergence and harmonisation, instead of being an instrument that preserves decentralised <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> or even <b>regulatory</b> competition. The welfare gains from achieving market integration should be balanced against the welfare losses of an inefficient allocation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers.</b> Copyright 2008 The Authors.

2500|$|The Supreme Court, by an 8-1 margin, {{agreed with}} the oil companies, finding that Congress had inappropriately {{delegated}} its <b>regulatory</b> <b>power</b> without both a clear statement of policy {{and the establishment of}} a specific set of standards by which the President was empowered to act. Although a loss for the Roosevelt administration and New Deal supporters, it was mitigated by the narrowness of the court's opinion, which did not deny Congress's authority to regulate interstate oil commerce. [...] Chief Justice Hughes, who wrote the majority opinion, indicated that the policy which Section 9(c) enacted was not unconstitutional and that it was only ruled unconstitutional because it was poorly worded and did not convey specific powers. [...] The Court's opinion indicated that Congress could resolve the unconstitutional provisions of the Act by simply adding procedural safeguards, hence the Connally Hot Oil Act of 1935 was passed into law.|$|E

40|$|The {{investment}} of a regulated firm affects the service/good provided on many dimensions. Should an integrated regulator {{take care of}} them all? Or is it better to have separate regulators responsible for them? We analyze the effect of the separation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> on the regulated firm's ex ante incentive to invest in a "cooperative" innovation. The effects of the innovation are not verifiable and the cost of investing is sunk, hence, there is a problem of hold-up. We find that when the innovation produces opposite effects the ex ante firm's incentive to invest is larger in the case of separation than in the case of integrated regulation. We also stress the risk of over-investment that the separation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> may induce. We maintain that along with classical incentive regulation-which mainly provides incentives for the firm to be efficient-the separation of <b>regulatory</b> <b>powers</b> {{may play a role in}} providing an incentive for cooperative innovations.
