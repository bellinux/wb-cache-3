50|$|LPG is {{composed}} mainly of propane and butane, while natural gas {{is composed}} of the lighter methane and ethane. LPG, vaporised and at atmospheric pressure, has a higher calorific value (94 MJ/m3 equivalent to 26.1kWh/m3) than natural gas (methane) (38 MJ/m3 equivalent to 10.6 kWh/m3), which means that LPG cannot simply be substituted for natural gas. In order to allow {{the use of the}} same burner controls and to provide for similar combustion characteristics, LPG can be mixed with air to produce a synthetic natural gas (SNG) that can be easily substituted. LPG/air mixing ratios average 60/40, though this is widely variable based on the gases making up the LPG. The method for determining the mixing ratios is by calculating the <b>Wobbe</b> <b>index</b> of the mix. Gases having the same <b>Wobbe</b> <b>index</b> are held to be interchangeable.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{liquefied}} natural gas (LNG) on pollutant emission inventories and air quality in the South Coast Air Basin of California were evaluated using recent LNG emission measurements by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas), and with a state-of-the-art air quality model. Pollutant emissions can be affected by LNG owing to differences in composition and physical properties, including the <b>Wobbe</b> <b>index,</b> a measure of energy delivery rate. This analysis uses LNG distribution scenarios developed by modeling Southern California gas flows, including supplies from the LNG receiving terminal in Baja California, Mexico. Based on these scenarios, the projected penetratino of LNG in the South Coast Air Basin {{is expected to be}} limited. In addition, the increased <b>Wobbe</b> <b>index</b> of delivered gas (resulting from mixtures of LNG and conventional gas supplies) is expected to cause increases smaller than 0. 05 percent in overall (area-wide) emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx). BAsed on the photochemical state of the South Coast Air Basin, any increase in NOx is expected to cause an increase in the highest local ozone concentrations, and this is reflected in model results. However, the magnitude of the increase is well below the generally accepted accuracy of the model and would not be discernible with the existing monitoring network. Modeling of hypothetical scenarios indicates that discernible changes to ambient ozone and particulate matter concentrations would occur only at LNG distribution rates that are not achievable with current or planned infrastructure and with <b>Wobbe</b> <b>index</b> vlaues that exceed current gas quality tariffs.

In addition to the full burner, the central body (the RPL – Rich/Pilot/Lean) is investigated. Methane is used to characterize standard gas turbine operation, and a non-standard fuel is explored using a generic syngas (67. 5 % Hydrogen, 22. 5 % Carbon monoxide and 10 % Methane). Both these gases are also investigated after dilution with nitrogen to a <b>Wobbe</b> <b>index</b> of 15 MJ/m 3. The experiments are performed in a high-pressure facility.

40|$|Introduction The gas {{transmission}} {{network in the}} Netherlands transports two different qualities of gas, low-calorific gas known as G-gas or L-gas and, high calorific gas (H-gas). These two gas qualities are transported in separate networks, and are connected by means of five blending and conversion stations where high-calorific gas can either be blended with low-calorific gas or ballasted with nitrogen to produce gas that can be introduced into the low-calorific, G-gas, network. The network was originally developed following {{the discovery of the}} large Groningen gas field. The Groningen field is low calorific gas. The low-calorific gas from the Groningen field became the standard for the consumers in the Netherlands. Later on, H-gas gas was produced from the so-called small fields in the Netherlands. High-calorific gas is also imported from Norway, Russia and through the LNG terminal in Rotterdam. The H-gas is supplied to industrial end users via approximately 80 connections to the high-calorific network and is also exported to other countries. The standard <b>Wobbe</b> <b>Index</b> bandwidth currently specified for exit points in the gas {{transmission network}} for H-gas is 47 - 55. 7 MJ/m 3 (25 / 0), with a number of regional variations as described in the Ministerial Ruling (MR) for gas quality. The supply of low-calorific gas from the Groningen field is in decline, and ultimately the future supply to end users will be high-calorific gas. In March 2012, the Minister of Economic affairs declared that all appliances falling under the Gas Appliance Directive (the GAD) should be able to switch to high-calorific gas to prepare for a smooth transition {{at the end of the}} lifetime of the Groningen field. For this purpose, a formal notification has been given to the European Commission. However, at the moment it is unclear what the future range of high-calorific gas quality should be; that is, the range of gas quality that appliances falling under the GAD can accept is at present uncertain. The question posed by the Dutch government is whether or not the government should change the existing notification of the requirements that GAD gas appliances should be able to meet to cope with high-calorific gas, and if so, how and when. Analysis The study comprised three major areas of investigation. In the first step, the limitations in appliance performance with varying gas quality were assessed. This assessment is based on a critical analysis of existing data from laboratory experiments on appliances from well-defined field tests and also from a critical analysis of non-experimental information (theoretical studies and evidence-based experience). In the second step, the future ranges of gas quality expected to be supplied in the Netherlands was inventoried, and the possibilities for, and costs of, treating the gases to limit the range of gas quality was assessed. In the third step, the potential of innovation for widening the range of gases acceptable for appliances was assessed. The recommendations summarized below are based on the synthesis of these three elements. Limitations in appliances We assessed the existing experimental, theoretical and practical/experiential evidence regarding which bands of <b>Wobbe</b> <b>Index</b> maintain the safety and reliability of the population of H-/E-band appliances installed in the field. In our opinion, the distribution practices in the UK, France, Denmark and Belgium give the best reflection of a practical range for Wobbe Index: the years-long practice in these countries shows that H-/E-band appliance performance with distribution limits in the range 4 - 5 MJ/m 3 satisfies the national requirements and/or customs for safety and reliability in these countries. We also note that DNV GL – Report No. 74106553. 01 b – www. dnvgl. com Page 2 these countries have some form of active maintenance regime. Provided adjustable appliances are properly adjusted, the laboratory experiments assessed support a range of 4 - 5 MJ/m 3, although these experiments require extra interpretation before being applied to the situation in practice. The theoretical analyses show that the approval regime does not safeguard the intended appliance performance in a number of situations. However, these analyses say nothing about the actual safe and reliable performance of appliances in the field. Therefore, we conclude that a bandwidth of in the range of 4 - 5 MJ/m 3 can be realized for appliances approved under the GAD. Future supply Ultimately, when Dutch indigenous gas production becomes small, gas is expected to be supplied by pipeline imports from Norway and Russia, and as LNG from the worldwide market. The Netherlands is expected to become a net importer from 2025 onwards. The expectation is further that the imported gas will have a <b>Wobbe</b> <b>Index</b> between 51 and 55. 7 MJ/m 3 (25 / 0). The upper limit of 55. 7 MJ/m 3 is set by the Dutch government. This gas quality bandwidth is significantly smaller than the current standard bandwidth permitted in the H-network, from 47 to 55. 7 MJ/m 3. The ‘small fields’ contribute predominantly to the lower half of this range. At the moment an annual volume of 25 bcm is produced from the small fields. By 2032 the total capacity including so-called futures is expected to be almost three times lower than the 2014 capacities. These futures are however uncertain. When the futures are not taken into account, the total capacity will be 15 times lower compared to 2014. In 2032 supply from the small fields will then only be 3 % of demand (20 % if the futures fully materialize). Excluding futures, the production volume of the small fields decreases to 1 bcm in 2030. Three cases with different <b>Wobbe</b> <b>Index</b> bandwidths were evaluated: a band of 2 MJ/m 3, significantly narrower than the expected range of import qualities, a wide band of 8 MJ/m 3 and a band coincident with the expected future import band of 4. 7 MJ/m 3. The results show that the narrow band option requires the most gas treatment, particularly nitrogen ballasting, which given the expected import will be required indefinitely. The costs for gas treatment (especially nitrogen ballasting) will thus recur every year. The widest band allows the widest accommodation of both import gases and residual small-field gases. Referring to the appliance limitations analysis above, not all appliances can handle a band of 8 MJ/m 3 without further gas treatment measures. We note that the potential measures that support the intake of ‘off-spec’ gas with a <b>Wobbe</b> <b>Index</b> lower than the minimum <b>Wobbe</b> <b>Index</b> of H-gas imports are expected to be temporary. The volume of gas from the small fields is expected to become very small after 2030 as mentioned above. The use of the gas quality management options described here is seen more as a transition measure and not as permanent. In light of the expected gas supply, the widest band gives therefore only a temporary advantage. For the intermediate band of 4. 7 MJ/m 3, the import gases can be easily accepted, but relatively more small-field gases become ‘off spec’, requiring blending with the H-gas import. The forecast of H-gas imports volumes indicate that sufficient H-gas is available for blending the ‘off spec’ gas in this case. Ballasting with nitrogen will not be required if the upper Wobbe limit is set at 55. 7 MJ/m 3. Concluding, choosing the intermediate band of 4. 7 MJ/m 3 corresponds to the bandwidth of the expected import of future H-gases of 51 - 55. 7 MJ/m 3, and is also within the range of 4 - 5 MJ/m 3 to which the GAD appliances have been exposed in practice. In this option there are no extra costs for nitrogen ballasting. This range may provide an optimum between appliance performance and expected gas supplies. Innovation An inventory has been made to determine the status of the development of innovative products aimed at extending the fuel flexibility of GAD end-use equipment, e. g. by means of active control systems. The inventory is based on interviews with different stakeholders and collecting existing information available, including progress made in existing innovation programs such as SBIR. It became clear that commercially available (premixed) appliances having active control systems are suited to operate across the entire E-band and for handling abrupt Wobbe fluctuations. We also observed promising developments for (inexpensive) control systems for premixed appliances to extend the fuel flexibility for both new domestic appliances and suitable appliances already installed in the field. Also, a sensor-based hob burner (cooker) is under development to guarantee high performance and capacity while using variable gas quality (L+H band). DNV GL is not aware of any existing developments or innovations to make other type of partially premixed domestic appliances, such as flow-through hot water heaters, suitable for a wide range of gas compositions. To our knowledge, no innovation regarding the development of fuel-adaptive control systems for non-domestic burners is currently being undertaken. However, several control strategies are possible and economically feasible. Recommendation Based on the analysis, DNV GL recommends setting the long term quality bandwidth for H-gas at 51 – 55. 7 MJ/m 3 (25 / 0). In this choice, the bandwidth (4. 7 MJ/m 3) is within the 4 - 5 MJ/m 3 with which millions of H-/E-band appliances function in other EU countries, aligning the distribution practice with those in other countries, and complex and costly gas quality management measures are limited. A consistent policy for appliance adjustment using known gas quality is essential for maintaining this band. We recommend updating the existing notification and suggest modifications to the notification as formulated in Appendix A. We further note that in terms of <b>Wobbe</b> <b>Index</b> this band allows room for the accommodation of a reasonable bandwidth for renewable gases...|$|R
40|$|An {{outwardly}} propagating spherical flame configuration {{has been}} used to characterise the combustion of different blended steelworks gas compositions, under atmospheric ambient conditions. A nonlinear extrapolative technique was used to obtain values of laminar burning speed and Markstein length for combustion with air and change in equivalence ratio. Peak burning speed was shown to reach almost 1 m s− 1 for the combustion of coke oven gas under marginally rich conditions, and the influence of flame stretch on burning speed also shown to increase with equivalence ratio. The molar fraction of coke oven gas (COG) was then blended in the range 0 – 15 % with four blast furnace gas mixtures (BFG) containing 1 – 7 % H 2 fractions, representative of the inherent compositional fluctuation experienced in production. Profiles for change in burning speed resulting from this addition of COG are presented, and the dampening extent of fluctuation resulting from the H 2 variation has been quantified. Results are also presented for the relative change in gross calorific value and corresponding <b>Wobbe</b> <b>index</b> of the variable blended gases across the tested limits. Modelled results were generated using the PREMIX coded CHEMKIN-PRO, and the performance of specified chemical reaction mechanisms evaluated relative to the experimental data...|$|R
40|$|Considering the {{transition}} towards the hydrogen economy, dependent on hydrogen penetration scenario, {{the cost of}} a new hydrogen pipeline infrastructure in Europe may amount to several thousands of billions of EURO’s. Therefore, the examination of the potential contribution of the existing natural gas assets is a practical and logical first step. As the physical and chemical properties of hydrogen differ significantly from those of natural gas, {{it is not at all}} possible to simply exchange natural gas by hydrogen in the existing infrastructure. In this paper first a brief overview will be given of the NATURALHY-project. Further the focus will be on the impact of added hydrogen on the performance of existing natural gas domestic end user appliances, which is related to the operation of the natural gas grid connecting the different types of appliance. The application of the fundamental insights and carefully designed experiments, comparing the behaviour of gases using justified reference conditions, have been shown to offer essential progress. The <b>Wobbe</b> <b>index</b> limits of the natural gas distributed pose a first limiting factor upon the maximum allowable hydrogen concentration. Constant-Wobbe index and decreasing-Wobbe index options of H 2 admixture have been studied. Considering the appliance light back H 2 limiting factor for domestic appliances, fuel...|$|R
40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on the central body rich-pilotlean (RPL) burner of a Siemens Industrial Turbomachinary 4 th generation DLE combustor to observe the combustion changes that may occur when using fuels other than natural gas. Measurements were taken of temperatures at multiple points along the RPL body while hydroxyl (OH) radical distribution extending from the dump plane of the burner was imaged by planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF). The RPL burner was run using four fuels; methane, a generic syngas (67. 5 % H 2, 22. 5 % CO and 10 % CH 4) and dilutions of these with nitrogen to a <b>Wobbe</b> <b>index</b> of 15 MJ/m 3. Each of the fuels was operated at several equivalence ratios ranging from f = 0. 80 to f = 1. 80, for combustion pressures of 3, 6 and 9 bar. It {{was found that the}} flame position in the RPL, determined from temperature measurement at the thermocouple positions, was dependent on the fuel, equivalence ratio {{and to a lesser extent}} pressure. A link was established between the OH distribution in the post burner region and RPL temperature profiles based on the expected flame behavior inside the RPL. For all measurement points some combustion occurred within the burner volume, indicated by thermocouples at the burner exit...|$|R
