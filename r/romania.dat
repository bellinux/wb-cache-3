5|$|As {{an effect}} of Waddington's intervention, <b>Romania</b> also agreed {{to resolve the issue}} of Jewish Emancipation. The {{government}} pledged itself to naturalize all of its non-Christian residents (see History of the Jews in <b>Romania).</b> Kogălniceanu himself made efforts to overturn this decision, and was bitter when the Germans refused to compromise. The resolution was debated inside <b>Romania</b> over the following year, and such a measure in respect to Jews was not introduced until 1922–1923.|$|E
5|$|During April–May 1944 the Romanian forces led by General Mihai Racoviţǎ, {{together}} with {{elements of the}} German Eighth Army were responsible for defending Northern <b>Romania</b> during the Soviet First Jassy-Kishinev Offensive, and {{took part in the}} Battles of Târgu Frumos. In late August 1944, the Red Army entered eastern <b>Romania.</b> On August 23, 1944, a coup led by King Michael I of <b>Romania</b> deposed Marshal Antonescu and set up a pro-Soviet government. It has been estimated that the royal coup shortened the war by six months. <b>Romania</b> soon declared war on Nazi Germany, and the First and Fourth Armies were pressed into action. After the expelling of the last Wehrmacht remnants from <b>Romania,</b> the Romanian Armies took part in the Siege of Budapest and the Prague Offensive of May 1945.|$|E

40|$|Present {{condition}} of Romanian economy is (still!) bad enough, given the yet existent (aftereffects of) world {{economic and financial}} crisis, so that this economy badly needs bolstering up in any manner whatsoever; considering this perspective, and <b>Romania’s</b> tourism potential, <b>Romania’s</b> tourism sector can become a hub of/for economic recovery. But, {{in order to do}} this, <b>Romania’s</b> policymakers need not lose from sight <b>Romania’s</b> long term objectives, whilst trying to attain (just) the short term ones. For the latter’ achievement fiscal policy is a main tool, but if this tool is used in extremis tourism sector will definitely suffer. On the other hand, it is also true fiscal policy, if used wisely, is more than able to be an essential tool with which one can enhance competitiveness of <b>Romania’s</b> tourism sector...|$|R

5|$|During 1916, <b>Romania</b> entered World War I as an Entente country, in {{alliance}} with the Russian Empire against Austria-Hungary and the other Central Powers. After a while, <b>Romania</b> began investigating the fate and loyalties of Austria-Hungarian Romanians who were held in Russian POW camps. Estimates for that period place {{the total population of}} Bukovinan and Transylvanian Romanians in such facilities, throughout Russia, at 120,000 or 130,000. Meanwhile, in <b>Romania</b> itself there were several thousand Romanian refugees from Austria-Hungary who immediately signed up for service in the Romanian Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} he had {{achieved}} in <b>Romania</b> in 1940 {{with the help of}} his son-in-law, Berger had proposed to Himmler that the next recruiting sphere be the Volksdeutsche communities of <b>Romania,</b> Hungary and Yugoslavia, which together contained about 1.5 million ethnic Germans. Little could be done to further this proposal until mid-1941, by which time Yugoslavia had been overrun by the Axis, and <b>Romania</b> and Hungary had joined the pact. Immediately after the lightning-quick defeat of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Hausser was being pressed to accept Yugoslav Volksdeutsche into his renamed SS-Division-Reich, even before it was withdrawn to prepare for Operation Barbarossa. On his way back to Germany from Yugoslavia, Hausser had transited through <b>Romania</b> and gathered another 600 ethnic German volunteers who he smuggled out of the country.|$|E

50|$|<b>Romania's</b> Communist {{government}} achieved {{an incredible}} {{degree of control}} (relative to the other Eastern Bloc nations) of the nation's largest religious community: the Romanian Orthodox Church.

50|$|Throughout 1941, {{especially}} after the Invasion of the Soviet Union, Ion Antonescu primarily focused on <b>Romania’s</b> military affairs, leaving Mihai Antonescu in almost full control of the country’s domestic matters. Although initially uncomfortable with <b>Romania’s</b> close alliance with Germany, Antonescu strengthened the nation’s ties with Adolf Hitler's regime after a string of early Axis victories against the Soviets. Antonescu primarily attempted to gain Germany’s favor by persecuting <b>Romania’s</b> Jews. Essentially running the interior ministry, he drafted a series of laws that resulted in thousands of <b>Romania’s</b> Jews being forced out of their jobs and positions, {{while at the same}} time they were denied access to countless other careers. More such laws resulted in the country’s Jews having their property seized.|$|R

The new state, officially named <b>Romania</b> since 1866, gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1877. At the end of World War I, Transylvania, Bukovina and Bessarabia united with the sovereign Kingdom of <b>Romania.</b> During World War II, <b>Romania</b> was an ally of Nazi Germany against the Soviet Union, fighting {{side by side with}} the Wehrmacht until 1944, when it joined the Allied powers and faced occupation by the Red Army forces. <b>Romania</b> lost several territories, of which Northern Transylvania was regained after the war.
