50|$|Until the {{announcement}} of NIST's AES contest, the majority of block ciphers followed {{the example of the}} DES in using a block size of 64 bits (8 bytes). However the birthday paradox tells us that after accumulating a number of blocks equal to the square root of the total number possible, there will be an approximately 50% chance of two or more being the same, which would start to leak information about the message contents. Thus even when used with a proper encryption mode (e.g. CBC or OFB), only 232 × 8 B = 32 GB of data can be safely sent under one key. In practice a greater margin of security is desired, restricting a single key to the encryption of much less data say a few hundred megabytes. Once that seemed like a fair amount of data, but today it is easily exceeded. If the cipher mode does not properly <b>randomise</b> the input, the limit is even lower.|$|E

50|$|Initially {{released}} on March 19, 2001, Rival Ball {{was presented as}} a sequel to DX-Ball 2, adding a new branch to the DX-Ball series as a spiritual successor by Longbow Digital Arts. Based upon the same engine as DX-Ball 2, the game recycles many of the original elements and programming by Seumas McNally (1979-2000). While the gameplay and design essentially remained the same, Rival Ball featured a cursor-based layout with buttons for navigation; new graphics for the power-ups; board designs with square shaped bricks; new sound effects; a new soundtrack; four difficulty settings and options to set timers, <b>randomise</b> board order and repeat board-sets; and most significantly: split-screen network play. The game was also ported to the Mac (requires CarbonLib 1.4 or later on Mac OS 8.6 or later), with the Mac version announced on April 3, 2002. Notably, while the Mac version is known as Rival Ball version 2.0, the port {{is identical to the}} outdated version 1.3 for the PC, and does not feature the online lobby.|$|E

While the court ruled against Gladys Ryan, the case remains a landmark as it established the right to privacy under the Irish Constitution (or perhaps more correctly, the right to bodily integrity under Article 40.3.1. The case also raised a legal controversy due to the introduction by Justice Kenny of the concept of unenumerated rights.

5000|$|... • The flow of {{membrane}} {{from the}} front rearward is not a flow of average plasma membrane proteins: The membrane internalised is a subset of plasma membrane proteins, such as LDL or transferrin receptors and the lipid bilayer in which they sit. These recycling molecules appear at the front surface of the cell and diffuse about, drifting rearwards until they are recaptured by a coated pit and transported back, through the cell, to the front. Other proteins {{do not participate in}} this cycle: Therefore, they experience a slow rearward flow of the lipid bilayer in which they reside. Thus, they are subject to two different influences: (a) they tend to get swept backward in this lipid flow and (b) they tend to <b>randomise</b> their distribution on the cell surface by Brownian motion. Calculation shows that, for non-cycling proteins, diffusion is the more important influence, so these molecules would be expected to have a near-random distribution on the cell’s surface. However, if a large object were attached to the cell surface that were unable to diffuse against the flow, it would be expected to be swept backward by the flow toward the trailing end of the cell. Indeed, it would act as a marker for that flow. This is the reason why carbon particles attached to the dorsal surface of a moving cell, or why aggregates of surface proteins, are seen to move to the back of a cell. This process is known as cap formation.|$|E

50|$|Standard Game {{offers the}} classic brick busting experience. The player may select a desired set of boards to play, whereas the game {{initially}} comes with two freeware board-sets of 4 boards each. As an added bonus, Rival Ball {{also includes the}} six demo board-sets from DX-Ball 2, with support for the five respective board packs from the game. Before a game starts, the player may set additional game options, including difficulty, time limits, randomised board order, and board-set repeat. The difficulty levels range from Easy to Medium, Hard and Impossible, and will determine several factors for the game. As the game's default setting, Medium implies a standard game with no specific alterations. On the other hand, Easy lets the player start with a big ball and expanded paddle, with the paddle size being fixed to not contract beyond the initial width. Easy also excludes three of the game's Power-Ups, including Death, Tiny Ball and Mega Shrink. If the chosen difficulty is Hard, the game starts with the regular paddle size, but a small ball. While the paddle cannot be expanded beyond its initial width in this mode, the ball can only grow to its regular size. Hard is also the only difficulty setting to introduce timed power-ups, where the effects from Blitz Ball, Laser, Fire Ball, Ice Ball and Catch are only temporary. The last difficulty setting is Impossible. While all power-ups are absent in this mode, the game starts with the most narrow paddle size and a tiny ball fixed at the highest speed. The additional game options are optional {{and can be used}} in conjunction with one another. By enabling Time Limit, the player may compete against the clock with settings of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes to complete a board-set. Random Boards will <b>randomise</b> the order of the boards in the chosen board-set. Lastly, Repeat Board-Set will repeat the total set of boards up to ten times in a row. When the player has completed a board, a Board Bonus will be added to the total score. Constituted by three elements, the player may earn a 'Balls Left' bonus rewarding 50 points for each additional ball left on the screen; a 'Perfect Ball' bonus rewarding 500 points if no balls were lost during the board; and a 'Perfect Brick' bonus of 250 points if all bricks were cleared. In addition to the Board Bonus, the completion of a board-set will also be summarised by a Set Bonus, consisting of a 'Paddles' bonus rewarding 250 points for each remaining paddle left; a 'Perfect Bricks' bonus rewarding 3000 points if all bricks were cleared across the entire set; and a secondary 'Perfect Ball' bonus rewarding 4,000 points if the board-set was completed without losing a single ball. Aside from single player, Standard Game also features a Hot-Seat multiplayer mode. In this mode, players take turns to clear a board-set, playing through the same boards successively, while competing to achieve the highest score. Turns are changed either when one player completes a board or loses a life, and the game goes on until all players have either finished the board-set or lost all spare paddles.|$|E

The main theoretical result of this paper is informed by the need to show that flips <b>randomise</b> the network quickly enough. Formally, we show that performing random flip operations on a regular graph of size n will rapidly sample from all such graphs almost uniformly at random (i. e. with error ε). Here, “rapidly” means in time polynomial in n and log ε − 1. This is done by extending a similar result for random switches, obtained in [3], using a two-stage direct canonical path construction.

40|$|Background It is {{important}} that planned <b>randomised</b> trials are justified {{and placed in the}} context of the available evidence. The SPIRIT guidelines for reporting clinical trial protocols recommend that a recent and relevant systematic review should be included. The aim of this study was to assess the use of the existing evidence in order to justify trial conduct. Methods Protocols of <b>randomised</b> trials published over a 1 -month period (December 2015) indexed in PubMed were obtained. Data on trial characteristics relating to location, design, funding, conflict of interest and type of evidence included for trial justification was extracted in duplicate and independently by two investigators. The frequency of citation of previous research including relevant systematic reviews and <b>randomised</b> trials was assessed. Results Overall, 101 protocols for RCTs were identified. Most proposed trials were parallel-group (n[*]=[*] 74; 73. 3 %). Reference to an earlier systematic review with additional <b>randomised</b> trials was found in 9. 9 % (n[*]=[*] 10) of protocols and without additional trials in 30. 7 % (n[*]=[*] 31), while reference was made to <b>randomised</b> trials in isolation in 21. 8 % (n[*]=[*] 22). Explicit justification for the proposed <b>randomised</b> trial on the basis of being the first to address the research question was made in 17. 8 % (n[*]=[*] 18) of protocols. A <b>randomised</b> controlled trial was not cited in 10. 9 % (95 % CI: 5. 6, 18. 7) (n[*]=[*] 11), while in 8. 9 % (95 % CI: 4. 2, 16. 2) (n[*]=[*] 9) of the protocols a systematic review was cited but did not inform trial design. Conclusions A relatively high percentage of protocols of <b>randomised</b> trials involves prior citation of <b>randomised</b> trials, systematic reviews or both. However, improvements are required to ensure that it is explicit that clinical trials are justified and shaped by contemporary best evidence...|$|R
