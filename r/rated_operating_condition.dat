Design metrics requirements like low cost, small size, high power factor, low {{percentage of total}} harmonic distortion etc. requires the power electronic systems to operate at high frequencies and at high power density. Failures of power converters are attributed largely by aging of power MOSFETs at high switching frequencies. Therefore, real time in-circuit prognostic of MOSFET {{needs to be done}} before their selection for power system design. Accelerated aging tests are performed in different circuits to determine the wear out failure of critical components based on their parametric degradation. In this paper, the simple and low-cost test beds are designed for real time in-circuit prognostics of power MOSFETs. The proposed condition monitoring scheme helps in estimating the condition of MOSFETs at their maximum <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> and will aid the system designers to test their reliability and benchmark them before selecting in power converters. ...|$|E

Overestimation of temperature results in spurious alerts {{that lead to}} unnecessary triggering of thermal control mechanisms, e.g., DVFS (Long et al. 2008; Memik et al. 2008). On the other hand, underestimation of temperature greatly reduces the reliability since the processor will continue to operate at a higher temperature than its <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> (Long et al. 2008; Memik et al. 2008).

In addition, allocating arbitrarily large number of sensors employed by the monitoring infrastructure, constructing the sensor networks will also pose a challenge (Long et al. 2008). An ideal goal is to monitor the highest temperatures on a microprocessor with allocating a minimum number of thermal sensors.

40|$|Typical Direct Torque Control (DTC) Induction Motor (IM) drive {{has good}} {{efficiencies}} while operating at its rated condition. Nevertheless, a motor drive operates far from its <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition,</b> which impairs the efficiency. Therefore, a conventional DTC IM drive {{system should be}} associated with a loss minimization strategy to maximize the drive efficiency for a wider range of operation. For a given operating condition, the losses in an IM can be minimized by adjusting to the appropriate flux level instead of conventionally keeping constant at its rated flux value. Consequently, this research proposed an online learning Artificial Neural Network Efficiency Optimization (ANNEO) controller with the aim to generate an adaptive flux level to optimize the efficiency of any different operating points, especially at low speed and low torque condition. ANNEO is implemented with an online learning second order Levernberg-Marquardt algorithm. The proposed controller uses the input power of the drive system as the objective function and minimizes it. In order to further improve the system dynamic response, an Artificial Neural Network speed controller (ANNSC) of DTC is included. In ANNSC, the back propagation algorithm is employed. The goal of this research is to achieve the efficiency optimization of DTC induction motor drives system while preserve the superior speed performance of IM application over a wide speed range.

40|$|A Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Electrical Engineering for the MScThe need for energy conservation is increasing the requirements for increased levels of electric motor & pump efficiencies. Controlling motor speed with load change has proven very successful in many applications such as water pumping.

The performance of the modified supercharger was investigated in a variable-component supercharger test rig and compared with that of the standard supercharger with an 8 -vaned diffuser.

40|$|A motor {{is said to}} be {{reliable}} if it can run at its <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> for a specified period of time. With the widespread use of electric motors in newer applications, reliability is a major concern in terms of safety as well as revenue. About 30 - 40 % of reported failures in induction motors are due to stator faults. It is well known that a stator fault starts as an inter-turn fault within a phase and then propagates into phase-to-phase and phase-to-ground faults that can then lead to complete shutdown of the motor. Two approaches have been taken in this dissertation to make an induction motor drive system more tolerant to stator faults; integration of an inter-turn fault detection method into a five-phase induction motor drive and design of fault-tolerant induction motors. The phase redundancy of five-phase motors makes it possible to achieve continued operation of the motor with an open phase. However, for true fault tolerance the drive must be able to detect an incipient fault and then transition to post fault operation. A low-cost diagnostic method based on DC voltage injection has been developed for detection of inter-turn faults in five-phase induction motor drive systems. It has been shown that difference in DC current response to an injected voltage before and after an inter-turn fault serves as a reliable fault indicator. The diagnostic is non-intrusive, requires no additional hardware and effectively integrates both fault detection and fault-tolerant control into the motor controller. The method has been successfully implemented and tested on low-cost microcontroller. The propagation of a stator inter-turn fault into a phase-to-phase fault is worsened in distributed winding induction motors where the different phase windings overlap each other at the end connections. Tooth wound or fractional slot concentrated winding (FSCW) stators have non-overlapping end connections and hence more physical and thermal isolation between the phases as compared to distributed winding stators. While FSCW configurations have been widely used for permanent magnet motors, their adoption for induction motors is a challenge. An FSCW configuration has been designed for outer rotor induction motors by using a dual slot layer stator structure and multilayer windings. Comparison with a conventional induction motor shows an 11 % reduction in the copper usage in addition to having non-overlapping phase windings...|$|E

40|$|Horizontal axis wind {{turbines}} have {{to withstand a}} wide range of atmospheric operating conditions from turbulent inflow to stand still. This can lead to airfoil incidence angles from any direction including reverse flow. Blade element methods require aerodynamic airfoil coefficients for the computation of the aerodynamic loads on the rotor blade. The state of the art method to acquire these aerodynamic coefficients is to take the polars from - 30 ° to + 30 ° from either wind tunnel experiments or CFD calculations and to extend it by the analogy of the flat plate (e. g. the post stall model from Montgomery 1). One problem of this approach is the discontinuity at the junction between the measured and the extended data due to different levels of physical modelling. Furthermore the flat plate analogy {{does not take into account}} effects like surface curvature or camber. For the data taken from wind tunnel experiments large test models and test sections are needed in order to meet the demanding requirements of the high Reynolds numbers typically encountered on modern wind turbine rotor blades. In contrast to that, CFD methods are less time consuming, especially when a lot of different airfoil geometries have to be investigated. At high angles of attack (AoAs) the flow separation from the airfoil leads to unsteady aerodynamical effects. Higher-order CFD methods such as Large Eddy Simulation and Direct Numerical Simulation would disclose a precise aerodynamic but exceed an appropriate effort for the whole range of AoAs and airfoil types. Due to the time efficiency aspect the steady RANS computation was chosen as simulation method for the DLR TAU code. The goal was to find one robust CFD setup with one mesh topology that allows the computation for the whole range of AoAs and of all airfoils in order to get smooth slopes in the aerodynamic coefficients. For the present paper five airfoils of the FFA-W 3 -xxx series 2 used on the DTU 10 MW wind turbine 3 were chosen. The airfoils have a relative thickness from t/c= 24. 1 % up to t/c= 60 % whereby some airfoils are equipped with a gurney flap. The flow conditions vary from Re= 6 x 106 to Re= 12 x 106 and M= 0. 058 to M= 0. 265 and, therefore, are in accordance with the <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition</b> of the rotor. Two different turbulence models (one-equation SA-neg and two-equation Menter-SST) were tested, whereas the SA-neg model was favored for the final simulations. The SA-neg model was originally developed for under-resolved grids and unphysical transient states resulting in a more stable solution in difficult flow conditions. It has been found out that the laminar-turbulent transition may not be neglected as it has an important impact on the suction peak even at high AoAs. The transition prediction has been performed by the eN method using the linear stability theory. Particularly for thick airfoils with large nose radius the consideration of transition affects the lift coefficient up to 0. 4 and the drag coefficient up to 0. 2. In few cases the flow solution did not converge. The respective points were excluded and interpolated by a higher order polynomial. This methodology was compared to the classical approach by which the aerodynamic coefficients in the range from - 30 ° to + 30 ° were computed by CFD and extended by the analogy of the flat plate. It can be shown that the presented methodology resolves physical effects in the coefficient shape in a more sophisticated manner. Furthermore the data are more consistent than the classical approach...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} work {{reported in this}} thesis stems from {{the development of an}} accurate and computationally efficient Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) research code, with a particular emphasis on the steady and unsteady aerodynamics analysis of complex low speed turbulent flows. Such turbulent flow problems include horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) and vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT) operating at design and off-design conditions. On the algorithmic side, the main contribution of this research is the successful development of a rigorous novel approach to low-speed preconditioning (LSP) for the multigrid fully coupled integration of the steady, time-domain and harmonic balance RANS equations coupled to the two-equation shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model. The design of the LSP implementation is such that each part of the code affected by LSP can be validated individually against the baseline solver by suitably specifying one numerical input parameter of the LSP-enhanced code. The thesis has investigated several important issues on modelling and numerical aspects which are seldom thoroughly analysed in the computational fluid dynamics problems of the type presented herein. The first and most important modelling issue is the necessity of applying the low speed preconditioning to both RANS and SST equations and maintaining the turbulent kinetic energy in the definition of the total energy, which, to the best knowledge of author, has never been seen in any published literature so far. Based on the results obtained in the analysis of the vertical axis wind turbine application, we have demonstrated that by preconditioning the SST turbulence equations, one can significantly improve the convergence rate; and keeping the turbulence kinetic energy in the total energy has a great positive effect on the solution accuracy. The other modelling issue to be analysed is the sensitivity of the flow solution to the farfield boundary conditions, particularly for low speed problems. The analyses reported in the thesis highlight that with a small size of the computational domain, the preconditioned farfield boundary conditions are crucial to improve the solution accuracy. As for the numerical aspects, we analyse the impact of using the relative velocity to build the preconditioning parameter on the flow solutions of an unsteady moving-grid problem. The presented results demonstrate that taking into account the grid motion in building the preconditioning parameter can achieve a noticeable enhancement of the solution accuracy. On the other hand, the nonlinear frequency-domain harmonic balance approach is a fairly new technology to solve the unsteady RANS equations, which yields significant reduction of the run-time required to achieve periodic flows with respect to the conventional time-domain approach. And the implementation of the LSP approach into the turbulent harmonic balance RANS and SST formulations is another main novelty presented herein, which is also the first published {{research work}} on this aspect. The newly developed low speed turbulent flow predictive capabilities are comprehensively validated {{in a wide range of}} tests varying from subsonic flow with slight compressibility to user-defined extremely low speed incompressible flows. The solutions of our research code with LSP technology are compared with experiment data, theoretical solutions and numerical solutions of the state-of-the-art CFD research code and commercial package. The main computational results of this research consist of the analyses of HAWT and VAWT applications. The first one is a comparative analysis of 30 % and 93. 5 % blade sections of a VESTAS multi-megawatt HAWT working in various regimes. The steady, time-domain and frequency-domain results obtained with the LSP solver are used to analyse in great detail the steady and unsteady aerodynamic characteristics in those regimes. The main motivation is to highlight the predictive capabilities and the numerical robustness of the LSP-enhanced turbulent steady, time-domain and frequency domain flow solvers for realistic complex and even more challenging problems, to quantify the effects of flow compressibility on the steady and yawed wind-induced unsteady aerodynamics in the tip region of a 82 -m HAWT blade in <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition,</b> and to assess the computational benefits achieved by using the harmonic balance method rather than the conventional time-domain method. The second application is the comparative aerodynamic analyses of the NREL 5 MW HAWT working in the inviscid steady flow condition. The main motivation of this analysis is to further demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the LSP solver to simulate the threedimensional wind turbine flows. The last application is the time-domain turbulent flow analysis of the VAWT to the aim of demonstrating the accuracy enhancement of the LSP solver for this particular problem, the necessity of applying the full preconditioning strategy, the important effect of the turbulent kinetic energy on the solution accuracy and the proper implementation of the preconditioning parameter required for an accurate numerical solution to an unsteady moving grid low-speed problem...|$|E
40|$|Recently, the Gas Engine-Driven Heat Pump (GHP) System {{has become}} an {{economic}} choice and more attractive climate control system than the conventional air conditioner due to its advantage in reducing fossil fuel consumption and environmental pollution. The GHP is {{a new type of}} heat pump in which the compressor (the core part) is driven by a gas engine. The GHP typically uses the work produced by the engine to drive a vapor-compression heat pump. At the same time, the waste heat rejected by the engine is used for heating purposes. To improve the system performance of the GHP, a numerical and experimental study has been made by using suction-liquid line heat exchangers in cooling operation (particularly in high ambient operations) and suction line waste heat recovery to augment heating capacity. Detail experimental and modeling of a GHP in high ambient operating conditions using R 410 A as a refrigerant is firstly included in this study. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques have been used to study the design of the heat exchangers to improve system performance during heating and cooling operations with refrigerant R- 410 a and ethylene glycol as the working fluids. Seven cases were investigated to obtain the optimal operating mode. For the first four cases, the operating fluids in the tube side (vapor refrigerant R 410 A) and the shell side (aqueous ethylene glycol) were kept the same while the inlet temperature and mass flow rate for the tube and shell sides are changed in different cases. For the last three cases, the operating fluids on the shell side are changed to liquid refrigerant R 410 A. The numerical results show that although the effectiveness of the shell tube exchanger is small due to the small thermal conductivity of vapor refrigerant R 410 A, the goal of this numerical study still has been reached and over 30, 000 Btu/hr heat exchange has been obtained with the current heat exchanger configuration. The output from the CFD analysis, total heat transferred and pressure drop, are used as an input to the overall GHP modeling. The performance of overall GHP system has been simulated by using ORNL Modulating Heat Pump Design Software, MODCON, which is used to predict steady-state heating and cooling performance of variable-speed vapor compression air-to-air heat pumps {{for a wide range of}} system configuration and operational variables. The modeling includes: (1) GHP cycle without any performance improvements (suction liquid heat exchange and heat recovery) as a baseline (both in cooling and heating mode), (2) the GHP cycle in cooling mode with the suction to the liquid heat exchanger incorporated, (3) GHP cycle in heating mode with heat recovery (recovered heat from engine). According to the system simulation results, a performance gain by using suction liquid line heat exchanger is obtained especially at higher ambient conditions. The waste heat of the gas engine can take about 20 - 25 %, of the total heating capacity in <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>condition.</b> The ambient temperature affects the performance of the heat pump but has little influence on the engine efficiency in the constant engine speed model. Because of the limitation of speed, the GHP still needs extra equipment to back up the heating in extremely low ambient temperatures. The modulating heat pump model was compared to experimental trends with respect to compressor speed and the basis of coefficient of performances (COPs) and capacities. The experiment was conducted with use of a psychrometric test facility at Oak Ridge National Heat pump Laboratory. The trends in COP and capacity were generally well predicted. The results of the absolute comparisons over a range of speeds and ambient conditions indicated that best model agreement was obtained at lower speeds in both the heating and cooling modes, with increasing performance over predictions (to maximums of about 10 % in both COP and capacity) occurring at higher speeds. Finally, a comparison of applications of GHP with its most common counterparts, an electrical DX heat pump, in a 5000 ft 2 office building was made in two typical locations (Las Vegas and Chicago) with using thermal simulation software. According to the comparisons, a primary energy saving (10. 6 % for the Las Vegas simulation and 22. 6 % for the Chicago simulation less than its nearest alternative) as well as much less CO 2 emissions (26 % for the Las Vegas simulation, and 59. 9 % for the Chicago simulation less than its nearest alternative) for a GHP system were found...|$|E

The useful energy consumed by the pumps is less than what they demand due to inefficiency caused by a number of reasons including the mismatch between the <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and their actual <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> Some studies including those done by the US Department of Energy, show that as much as 30 - 50 % of energy consumed by pumping systems could be saved through equipment and control changes in the pumping systems.   Zambia, like many countries, faces an electricity shortage. Improving energy efficiency in pumping related operations can help save electricity costs and thus promote sustainable development and ultimately reduce global warming. This document discusses various methods of reducing pumping related electricity costs which can be categorised under either mechanical or electrical methods.   Preliminary energy audits on some pumping infrastructure for three water utility companies in Zambia were carried out and results showed various opportunities for saving electricity costs. Detailed study on selected pumping infrastructure revealed that as much as fifty four (54 %) electricity cost savings could result at one pump station by correcting the operating points of pumps such that the Best Efficiency Points (BEP) on the pump characteristic curves matched the pumping system head requirements.   Interactive presentation was done via Skype</p...|$|R
40|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{operate in}} unsteady wind {{conditions that are}} caused by the terrain and the atmospheric boundary layer which results in statistical fluctuating inflow conditions. Both effects are studied in CFD studies throughout literature, as lately by Castellani et al. Conversely, the specific investigations of single unsteady events as (large) longitudinal transient gusts are rare. Thus, the performed work presents a procedure, implemented in the CFD-solver THETA, to propagate longitudinal transient gusts through a flow field. In a first attempt, the gust is modelled in a cosines shape that strikes the generic NREL 5 MW wind turbine at <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and lasts about 6 seconds. Thereafter, the capability to simulate the aforementioned wind turbine under an extreme operating gust, following the international standard IEC 61400 - 13 definition, is presented. The smooth cosines curve is interrupted by the 3 /rev characteristic which is caused by respecting the tower during modelling. Moreover, the moderate gust speeds of ± 0. 5 m/s lead to noticeable changes in rotor torque. The flow states on the rotor blade before the gust strike and at maximal gust velocity are compared. An increased blade loading is detectable in the pressure coefficients which are displayed as contour plots. Moreover, the separation region on the blade root increases when the gust strikes the wind turbine...|$|R

40|$|Nanoelectronic {{devices are}} {{considered}} to be the computational fabrics for the emerging nanocomputing systems due to their ultra-high speed and integration density. However, the imperfect bottom-up self-assembly fabrication leads to excessive defects that have become a barrier for achieving reliable computing. In addition, transient errors continue to be a problem. The massive parallelism rendered by nanoscale integration opens up new opportunities but also poses challenges on how to manage such massive resources for reliable and high-performance computing. In this paper, we propose a nanoarchitecture solution to address these emerging challenges. By using dynamic redundancy allocation, the massive parallelism is exploited to jointly achieve fault (defect/error) tolerance and high performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique under a range of fault <b>rates</b> and <b>operating</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011. Reluctance {{synchronous}} Machines (RSM's) {{have become}} a viable alternative for alternating current (ac) drives since electronic drives have improved. These electronic drives make use of static switching devices to control the speed and torque of ac machines. The output waveforms of these devices contain numerous harmonics which can have harmful effects {{on some of the}} machine's performance parameters. Performance parameters of the RSM include torque, torque ripple, power, power factor and efficiency which are essential for the machine designer as well as the user. Poor efficiency of the RSM is mainly due to the copper losses of the stator windings and core losses in the stator iron. The core losses primarily consist of hysteresis- and eddy-current losses as well as additional losses which are due to domain wall rotation and pinning. Unlike the Induction Machine (JM), the RSM has no copper losses in the rotor, which reduces the operating temperature of the machine considerably. This thesis will focus on the influence non sinusoidal currents have on the performance parameters of a RSM. The machine will be subjected to ideal harmonics created by a six pulse drive which are theoretically predicted based on the operation of a six pulse drive. The machine will also be subjected to published data which are measured data for a more practical approach. These two cases will be compared to <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, in average, {{one third}} of the fuel energy {{consumed}} by an engine is wasted throughout the exhaust gases. The recovery of this amount of energy would enable a reduction of the fuel consumption. One solution is to integrate an exhaust heat recovery system based on a Rankine cycle. The first and most crucial step in the design is the definition of its architecture, the definition of the <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and the sizing of the different components whilst considering the heat recovery over customer driving cycles. This paper presents a steady-state model of a steam Rankine cycle built by interconnecting sub-models of the heat exchangers, the pump and the expander. All the models were developed under EES (Engineering Equation Solver) environment. The models of heat exchanger are developed using the ε-NTU method. A heat exchanger is subdivided into three zones, each of them being characterized by both the exhaust gases and water side pressure drop as well as heat transfer coefficient. The evaluation of the two-phase zone pressure drop and heat transfer with respect to the vapour quality was carried out. The model of rotary piston expander describes the evolution of the fluid through the device and was split into three global steps: pressure drop across the supply port, isentropic and expansion at constant volume, internal and external heat transfers. The overall simulation model is finally used to predict the performance of the heat recovery system as the <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and geometrical characteristics of each component are modified. An optimal sizing of the system is proposed and the underlying methodology is discussed. The analysis of the results pointed out that the levels of high/low pressure and the amount of superheat are the main parameters that impact the performance of the cycle and the sizing of the components.

40|$|A modular {{multilevel}} converter (MMC) configuration {{is presented}} as a medium-voltage high-power drive for variablespeed applications incorporating symmetrical six-phase machines. The topology employs six standard MMC phase-legs feeding two isolated groups of three-phase machine windings, each with 60 ° spatial phase-displacement. A novel concept of ripple-power decoupling between adjacent sub-modules (SMs) of MMC phaselegs, while feeding machine windings in a spatial phase-opposition fashion, is realized through isolated dc-dc converter modules. This concept offers a significant reduction in SM capacitance, while eliminating the problem of SM capacitor wide voltage fluctuations, especially at low operating frequencies. Furthermore, the proposed configuration can efficiently operate at near zero frequency, therefore a machine speed-range from zero speed up to the rated speed is possible under <b>rated</b> torque <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> The proposed MMC configuration is analyzed in detail, and its performance is validated using both simulation and experimentation...|$|R
40|$|Electromigration as a {{possible}} thin-film module failure mechanism was investigated using several specially made, fully aluminized thin-film photovoltaic (TF-PV) modules. The effect of electromigration, as determined experimentally by measuring increases in electrical resistance across scribe lines, can be expressed {{as the product of}} a damage function, which correlates degradation <b>rate</b> with <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> such as current density and temperature, and a susceptibility function, which is defined by module design parameters, particularly aluminum purity and the configuration of the intercell region. Experimental measurements and derived acceleration factors suggest that open-circuit failure resulting from electromigration should not be a serious problem in present state-of-the-art TF-PV modules. Nevertheless, significant intercell resistance increases can result from long-term electromigration exposure, especially in future high-efficiency modules. The problem can be alleviated, however, by appropriate metallization applications and/or proper design of the intercell region...|$|R
40|$|Purpose– To {{provide a}} new and simple inverse rotor time {{constant}} identification method {{which can be used}} to update an indirect rotor field oriented controlled (IRFOC) induction motor algorithm. Design/methodology/approach– Two different equations are used to estimate the rotor flux in the stator reference frame. One of the equations {{is a function of the}} rotor time constant, rotor angular velocity and the stator currents. The other equation is a function of measured stator currents and voltages. The equation that uses the voltage and the current signals of the stator serves as reference model, however, the other equation works as an adjustable model with respect to the variation of the rotor time constant. Voltage signals used in the reference model equation are obtained from the measured DC bus voltage and the inverter gating signals. The proposed scheme is verified using a MATLAB/SIMULINK model for two different motors and experimentally using a DSP development tool (MCK 243) supplied by Technosoft S. A. Findings– The proposed estimator was able to successfully track the actual value of the inverse rotor time constant for different load torque and speed <b>operating</b> <b>conditions.</b> Increased oscillations in the estimated inverse rotor time constant appeared at lower speeds (below 10 per cent of rated speed) due to drift in a PI regulator (used at the estimator side), which was tuned under <b>rated</b> <b>operating</b> <b>conditions</b> and using parameters nominal values. Research limitations/implications– This estimation scheme is limited when near zero speed operation is demanded; otherwise it gives a simple and practical solution. A suggested way out of this, is to provide a self‐tuning controller that can automatically adjust even for zero speed operation, or to automatically disconnect the estimator and take the most updated value as long as the operating speed is below a predetermined value. Originality/value– This paper presented a new inverse rotor time constant estimator for an IRFOC induction motor application and in conjunction rotor flux was estimated without voltage phase sensors...|$|R
