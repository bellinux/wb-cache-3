5|$|While {{cyberpunk}} {{remained a}} core {{part of the}} game, the team were faced with the trouble that no-one <b>really</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> cyberpunk was any more: the most recent game and film references they had were from the early 2000s, as many works {{that might have been}} classed as cyberpunk were now being treated as science fiction. While they could easily have replicated the atmosphere of films like Blade Runner, the team wanted to create something original within the genre. Something that concerned the team was about portraying the world of Human Revolution in relation to the original Deus Ex, which chronologically took place 25 years later: while the original Deus Ex used technological elements common {{at the time it was}} made such as 4:3 aspect ratio monitors and landline telephones, Human Revolution used mobiles and wide-screen televisions. According to Jacques-Belletête, this separation was ultimately put down to the differing portrayals of the world between the two games: while Deus Ex was set in poor communities and focused on the social impact of new technology, Human Revolution focused on the high end of society and technology's physical impact.|$|E
25|$|The di Marcos are now deemed as {{something}} of a failure for EastEnders. Since their departure, the family has even been mocked in an EastEnders official book, entitled EastEnders 20 Years In Albert Square. In the book, the author, Rupert Smith, writes :"Nobody <b>really</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> to do with the di Marco family, who had been languishing in the pizza restaurant without a decent storyline between them. Finally, there was nothing else for it: the di Marcos would have to go. All of them…it was as if they'd never been".|$|E
25|$|The OECD {{reported}} on Irish schools {{and levels of}} education in 1962-68, as {{an essential part of}} the process of Ireland's 1973 accession into the EEC, providing the vital external stimulus for reform. Finally the 1970 Kennedy Report, prepared in 1967-70, though flawed in parts, led to the abolition of the schools over the next decade, starting with Artane in 1969. In the interim, tens of thousands of children had been inmates, some from infancy. Despite frequent complaints and enquiries that called for reforms, the official line until the 1990s was that nobody in government, the church or the civil service <b>really</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> was taking place. Notably, Micheal Martin stated on 13 May 1999 that: The concept of the child as a separate individual with rights came late to this country.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{produced}} by American record producer Jude Cole, Lifehouse, and John Fields. Lifehouse started recording Who We Are without any demos, and only had lyrics from Jason Wade when they entered the studio. When asked about creating a song for the album, Lifehouse lead percussionist Rick Woolstenhulme, Jr. said, [...] "Nobody <b>really</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they would be playing. We just cut it, listened to it and realized it was pretty electric… the kind of song where you just turn up the radio." [...] The album focused on the different emotions of love, bliss, struggles, and pain. Musically, the album {{was a combination of}} rock, alternative, and adult alternative. After being asked about the title of the album, Wade stated, [...] "We established camaraderie on the road and gelled as a unit. This record defines 'Who We Are,' which is why that’s the title. The sound fits where we’re at right now." ...|$|E

500|$|Adams {{began her}} {{professional}} {{career as a}} dancer in a 1994 dinner theater production of A Chorus Line in Boulder, Colorado. The gig required her to wait on tables before getting up on stage to perform. Although she enjoyed singing and dancing, she disliked waitressing and ran into trouble when a fellow dancer, whom she considered a friend, made false accusations about her to the director. Adams said, [...] "I never <b>really</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> the lies were. I only knew I kept getting called in and lectured about my lack of professionalism." [...] She lost the job but went on to perform in dinner theater at Denver's Heritage Square Music Hall and Country Dinner Playhouse. During a performance of Anything Goes at the Country Dinner Playhouse in 1995, she was spotted by Michael Brindisi, the president and {{artistic director of the}} Minneapolis-based Chanhassen Dinner Theater, who offered her a job there. Adams relocated to Chanhassen, Minnesota, where she performed in the theater for the next three years. She loved the [...] "security and schedule" [...] of the job, and has said that she learned tremendously from it. Nonetheless, the grueling work took its toll on her: [...] "I had a lot of recurring injuriesbursitis in my knees, pulled muscles in my groin, my adductor and abductor. My body was wearing out." ...|$|E
500|$|It {{would be}} January 1997 until the band {{would be able}} to wrap up {{sessions}} for Dude Ranch, eventually amounting to five weeks of recording. For the final touches, Unwritten Law frontman Scott Russo donated a few vocal tracks to [...] "Josie", and Trombino let Blink-182 record a couple of jokes between songs using his sound-effects machine. The group contacted Fletcher Dragge of Pennywise to find someone to remix a few tracks from the album, and he suggested Donnell Cameron of Track Recording Studios. The band went in to Track and re-recorded Raynor's drum tracks for several songs. Hoppus recalled [...] "I remember when we finished Dude Ranch I was so proud. That {{was the first time we}} could take the time and whatever to make a good record." [...] Representatives from MCA dropped by on occasion and were excited by the material they heard. [...] "When we were in there mixing, the A person would come by," [...] remembered Cameron. [...] "I don't think the band <b>really</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> they had but certainly the label knew they had so many good songs on the record." [...] DeLonge remembered it differently: [...] " [...] fucking hated pop-punk. They wanted nothing to do with it. They were into Pavement or whatever." [...] After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood.|$|E

The discovery is generally credited to Australian gastroenterologists Dr. Barry Marshall and Dr. J Robin Warren, who published their findings in 1983. The pair received the Nobel Prize in 2005 for their work. Before this, nobody <b>really</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> caused stomach ulcers, though a popular belief was that the [...] "stress" [...] played a role.

The priests consequently enjoyed a position of considerable power over the laity, which they strove to maintain and increase.

2500|$|Night of the Living Dead premiered on October 1, 1968 at the Fulton Theater in Pittsburgh. Nationally, it {{was shown}} as a Saturday {{afternoon}} matinée – as was typical for horror films at the time – and attracted an audience consisting of pre-teens and adolescents. The MPAA film rating system was not in place until November 1968, so even young children were able to purchase tickets. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times chided theater owners and parents who allowed children access to the film with such potent content for a horror film they were entirely unprepared for: [...] "I don't think the younger kids <b>really</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> hit them," [...] he said. [...] "They were used to going to movies, sure, and they'd seen some horror movies before, sure, but this was something else."

2500|$|In November 1962, Olivia died of measles {{encephalitis}} at age seven. Her death left Dahl [...] "limp with despair", {{and gave}} him a feeling of guilt that he could not do anything for her. Dahl subsequently became a proponent of immunisation and dedicated his 1982 book The BFG to his daughter. After Olivia's death, Dahl lost faith in God and viewed religion as a sham. While mourning her loss he had sought spiritual guidance from the former Archbishop of Canterbury Geoffrey Fisher, but became dismayed when Fisher told him that although Olivia was in Paradise, her beloved dog Rowley would never join her there, with Dahl recalling: [...] "I wanted to ask him how he could be so absolutely sure that other creatures did not get the same special treatment as us.
