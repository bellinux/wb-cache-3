5|$|The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess is an action-adventure game {{focused on}} combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. It uses the basic control scheme {{introduced}} in , including context-sensitive action buttons and L-targeting (Z-targeting on the Wii), {{a system that}} allows the player to keep Link's view focused on an enemy or important object while moving and attacking. Link can walk, run, and attack, and will automatically jump when running off of or <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ledge.

5|$|Both monthly {{and daily}} Yotsuba&! {{calendars}} {{have been released}} every year since 2005, although a monthly calendar for 2009 was not released due to constraints on Azuma's schedule. The 2005 edition of the monthly calendar featured pictures of Yotsuba playing with animals such as lions, zebras, and kangaroos. The 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2010 editions feature photographs altered to include Yotsuba doing such things as playing with other children or <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> balloon. The photographs were by Miho Kakuta, with drawings by Kiyohiko Azuma. The daily calendars have a mix of original and manga artwork, with occasional captions, {{as well as other}} fun items – for example, the 2006 calendar had a game of shiritori ongoing through the year. The daily calendars run from April to March, following the Japanese school year instead of the calendar year.|$|E

5|$|Clemmons {{was accused}} {{multiple}} times of displaying violent behavior during court appearances. In one incident, he dismantled a metal door stop and hid {{it in his}} sock {{to use as a}} weapon. It was discovered and confiscated by a court bailiff. In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a bailiff, but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead. Clemmons was once accused of <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him. At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.|$|E

Unfortunately, {{there is a real}} Black Widow spider in the box and when Homer grabs what he thinks is a plastic spider, he is bitten by it. The bite leaves Homer paralyzed and unable to speak. When Lisa reads for him, she discovers that he can communicate through farting. The Simpson family is amazed at the result and Lisa helps Homer tell Marge how he feels about her. When he is again bitten by another spider (a radioactive one this time), he gains the ability to shoot spider webs out of his rear end and have the same abilities as Spider-Man, though he is still unable to move or talk.|$|E

During the making of the film, Corbucci and Trintignant were interviewed; Corbucci discussed the nature of violence in his films and Spaghetti Westerns in general (comparing the use of violence in such films to the James Bond franchise), while Trintignant spoke of the unusual nature of his role and how he would practice drawing his gun – by pulling a sock (substituting for the gloves Silence wears in the film) off his hand and <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long-steamed artichoke in his pocket.|$|E

500|$|At {{the same}} time as the police handed control over to the SAS, they began making {{arrangements}} for the IRA operatives once they were in custody, including finding a police vehicle in which to transport the prisoners. A patrol car containing Inspector Luis Revagliatte and three other uniformed officers, apparently on routine patrol and with no knowledge of Operation Flavius, was ordered to return to police headquarters as a matter of urgency. The police car was stuck in heavy traffic travelling north on Smith Dorrien Avenue, close to the roundabout where it meets Winston Churchill Avenue. The official account states that at this point, Revagliatte's driver activated the siren on the police car in order to expedite the journey back to headquarters, intending to approach the roundabout from the wrong side of the road and turn the vehicle around. The siren apparently startled McCann and Farrell, just as Soldiers [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] were about to challenge them, outside the Shell petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue. [...] "Soldier A" [...] stated at the inquest that Farrell looked back at him and appeared to realise who [...] "A" [...] was; [...] "A" [...] testified that he was drawing his pistol and intended to shout a challenge to her, but [...] "events overtook the warning": that McCann's right arm [...] "moved aggressively across the front of his body", leading [...] "A" [...] to believe that McCann was <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> remote detonator. [...] "A" [...] shot McCann once in the back; [...] "A" [...] went on to tell the inquest that he believed Farrell then reached for her handbag, and that he believed Farrell may also have been <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> remote detonator. [...] "A" [...] also shot Farrell once in the back, before returning to McCann—he shot McCann a further three times (once in the body and twice in the head). [...] "Soldier B" [...] testified that he reached similar conclusions to [...] "A", and shot Farrell twice, then McCann once or twice, then returned to Farrell, shooting her a further three times. Soldiers [...] "C" [...] and [...] "D" [...] testified at the inquest that they were moving to apprehend Savage, who was by now [...] south of the petrol station, as gunfire began behind them. [...] "Soldier C" [...] testified that Savage turned around while simultaneously reaching towards his jacket pocket at {{the same time}} as [...] "C" [...] shouted [...] "Stop!"; [...] "C" [...] stated that he believed Savage was <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> remote detonator, at which point he opened fire. [...] "Soldier C" [...] shot Savage six times, while [...] "Soldier D" [...] fired nine times. All three IRA members died. One of the soldiers' bullets, believed to have passed through Farrell, grazed a passer-by.|$|E

The slinky leaves the train, and passes Middleton busking in the train station. The slinky ventures to find the boy, facing a range of challenges along the way; these include avoiding fruit falling on it and riding a skateboard. In {{the middle of the}} music clip, the slinky is shown making its way through a music room in which Powderfinger are performing [...] "My Happiness". It rests on the bar and the band finishes playing, while the background music continues. As Powderfinger leaves, the slinky is picked up by Haug. He gets into a car and places the slinky on the car's dashboard, but it falls out the window as the car turns a tight corner. It lands outside the gate of a house and is picked up and brought inside to the boy.|$|E
