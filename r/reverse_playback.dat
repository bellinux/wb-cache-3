In the 1950s, the development of the experimental music genre known as musique concrète and a simultaneous spread of the use of tape recorders in recording studios led to tape music compositions, in which music was composed on tape using techniques including reverse tape effects.|$|R

40|$|Modern video coding {{standards}} are basically designed for forward playback only. Recently, {{we have developed}} a number of macroblock(MB) -based techniques to support <b>reverse</b> <b>playback</b> for compressed videos by exploiting the motion relationship between adjacent frames. Nevertheless, the MB-based techniques give no effect on traversing GOP boundaries reversely since no inter-frame prediction takes place between the last frame of one GOP and the first frame of its succeeded GOP. In this paper, we borrow ideas from the SP-picture concept in H. 264 to establish linkages across GOP boundaries by encoding the last frame of each GOP as a primary SP-frame {{as well as its}} corresponding secondary SP-frame. During <b>reverse</b> <b>playback</b> across GOP boundaries, the secondary SP-frame is decoded by using the I-frame in its succeeded GOP as the motion-compensated frame. We believe that we are the first to consider SP-frames to build the linkage between two GOPs for <b>reverse</b> <b>playback.</b> Our scheme can also be used in any future coding standards that offer the similar coding mechanism of SP-frames. This approach can remarkably mitigate the required decoder complexity over 90 % during <b>reverse</b> <b>playback</b> across GOP boundaries, but the straightforward implementation introduces serious drift errors. Therefore, as a further contribution of this paper, a novel scheme is designed to avoid the drift problem. Instead of arranging the primary SP-frame before the I-frame, the proposed scheme allocates various MBs within the GOP to be encoded as the SP-picture type. This completely new and unique arrangement for SP coding in which a primary SP MB and its corresponding secondary SP MB are no longer at the same time instant is specially designed for our MB-based techniques, and can be proved to eliminate the possible drift effect for <b>reverse</b> <b>playback.</b> With this allocation strategy, results from our experimental work show that the inherent GOP discontinuity problem can be avoided without introducing additional drift between forward and <b>reverse</b> <b>playback.</b> Department of Electronic and Information Engineerin...|$|E

However, it was capable of producing extremely high-quality images containing about 400 horizontal lines of video resolution, and remained the de facto industry standard for television broadcasting from its inception in 1956 to the mid-1980s, when newer, smaller, and lower-maintenance videotape formats superseded it.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel Wyner-Ziv-based video {{compression}} scheme which supports encoding {{a new type}} of inter frame called `M-frame'. Different from traditional multi-hypothesis inter frames, the M-frame is specially compressed with its two neighbor frames as reference at the encoder, but can be identically reconstructed by using any one of them as prediction at the decoder. Based on this, the proposed Wyner-Ziv-based bidirectionally decodable video compression scheme supports decoding the frames in a video stream in both temporal order and reverse order. Unlike the other schemes which support <b>reverse</b> <b>playback,</b> our scheme achieves the reversibility with low extra cost of storage and bandwidth.

40|$|Abstract With the {{proliferation}} of digital video and the popularity of video streaming applications, it is highly desirable to find and access video segments of interest by searching through the content of video at a speed that is faster than a normal playback. The key functions that enable quick browsing of video are fast-forward and fast-reverse playbacks. However, motion-compensated predic-tion adopted in the current video coding standards drastically complicates these operations. One approach to implement the fast-forward/reverse playback is to store an additional reverse-encoded bitstream in the server. Once the client requests a fast-forward/reverse operation, the server can select an appropriate frame for the client from either the forward-encoded bitstream or the reverse-encoded bitstream by considering the cost of network bandwidth and decoder complexity. Unfortunately, these two bitstreams are encoded separately. The frame in one bitstream may not be exactly identical to the frame in another bitstream. If one of these frames is then used as the reference for the requested frame, which is in another bitstream, it induces mismatch errors. In this paper, a novel H. 264 dual-bitstream system aiming at providing the fast-forward/ <b>reverse</b> <b>playback</b> based on SP/SI-frames is proposed. The proposed system can completely eliminate mismatch errors when the frame in the reverse-encoded bitstream replaces the frame in the forward-encoded bitstream and vice versa. Experimental results confirm that the proposed system is effective in eliminating mismatch errors so as to enhance {{the performance of the}} dual-bitstream system.

40|$|Video {{communication}} {{has received}} tremendous attention from both academia and industry. The conventional hybrid video coding scheme has demonstrated state-of-the-art coding performance. However, its application in video communication still faces several challenges, {{such as the}} transmission error of the wireless networks and the power limitation of the hand-held devices. The purpose {{of this research is}} to investigate novel algorithms to address the aforementioned issues in conventional hybrid video coding schemes. This work consists of two major parts as follows. The first part investigates the novel applications and further advances of the newly emerged Wyner-Ziv video coding (WZVC) algorithm. Central to the WZVC is the correlation estimation problem. The accuracy of this correlation estimation has big impact on the coding efficiency of WZVC. In this thesis we investigate this problem and propose a universal solution to a general WZVC scheme. Based on progressive learning and convex optimization, the proposed method achieves considerable gain over the existing methods; One promising application of WZVC is low complexity encoding. In this thesis we investigate using Wyner-Ziv successive refinement (WZSR) in such application to improve the coding efficiency. We also conduct rate-distortion analysis and prove that the loss due to decoder motion estimation is limited to less than 2. 17 dB using the proposed WZSR based scheme. This result, comparing with the existing analysis result, yields that the proposed scheme can gain 4 dB in some cases over the original WZVC scheme; WZVC is fiexible in that the decoder can reconstruct the video almost identically even if using different prediction frames. Based on this feature, we propose a novel Wyner-Ziv based bidirectionally decodable (WZ-BID) video coding scheme and the corresponding video streaming system. This system achieves three major functionalities: <b>reverse</b> <b>playback,</b> stream switching and error resilience simultaneously. We also propose an optimal hybrid WZ-BID/H. 264 scheme which outperforms the H. 264 scheme in all the tested bit rate and packet loss rate. The second part addresses the error resilience and error concealment problems of video communication. Error resilient transcoding (ERT) is a technique to improve the error robustness of offline compressed video. However, ERT introduces mismatch error and transcoding distortion. In this work we propose a new video slice type called 'L-slice'. Transcoding the traditional P-slices into L-slices improves the error robustness without introducing mismatch error and trancoding distortion. Based on this, we propose a novel offline-transcoding-online-composing scheme which achieves adaptive error robustness to time-varying channel conditions; Error concealment at the video decoder is to recover erroneous picture region based on correctly decoded region in the same frame or the neighboring frames. However, the existing error concealment techniques cannot give satisfactory result when a whole frame is lost. In this thesis, we propose a novel joint forward-backward error concealment method based on optimal linear minimum square error (LMMSE) estimation. Experiments suggest that the proposed method can achieve considerable gain over the state-of-the-art temporal error concealment method in both objective and subjective quality...|$|E
