60|$|But {{he would}} have gone; {{he would have}} left the house, {{although}} {{he had begun to}} comprehend that in leaving it he must probably lose much of his authority over the money taken in the shop; he would, however, have done so, had not Mrs. Jones come down upon him with the whole force of her tongue, and the full violence of her malice. When Robinson should have become one with Maryanne Brown, and should also have become the <b>resident</b> <b>partner,</b> then would the influence of Mrs. Jones in that establishment have been brought to a speedy close.|$|E
60|$|Clarence's voice trembled, and Emily {{had tears}} in her eyes as she asked if {{absolutely}} nothing could be done for him. Clarence meant to write to Mr. Castleford, who would no doubt beg the chaplain at the station to show the young man some kindness; also, perhaps, to the <b>resident</b> <b>partner,</b> whom Clarence had looked at once over his desk, but in his rawest and most depressed days. The only clerk out there, whom he knew, would, he thought, be no element of safety, and would not like the youth the better either for bringing his recommendation or bearing old Frith's name.|$|E

6000|$|It {{was a great}} {{augmentation}} of my uneasiness to be bereaved, at this eventful crisis, of the inestimable {{services of}} Miss Mills. But Mr. Mills, who was always doing something or other to annoy me--or I {{felt as if he}} were, which was the same thing--had brought his conduct to a climax, by taking it into his head that he would go to India. Why should he go to India, except to harass me? To be sure {{he had nothing to do}} with any other part of the world, and had a good deal to do with that part; being entirely in the India trade, whatever that was (I had floating dreams myself concerning golden shawls and elephants' teeth); having been at Calcutta in his youth; and designing now to go out there again, in the capacity of <b>resident</b> <b>partner.</b> But this was nothing to me. However, it was so much to him that for India he was bound, and Julia with him; and Julia went into the country to take leave of her relations; and the house was put into a perfect suit of bills, announcing that it was to be let or sold, and that the furniture (Mangle and all) was to be taken at a valuation. So, here was another earthquake of which I became the sport, before I had recovered from the shock of its predecessor! ...|$|E

30|$|In 2008, a law {{change was}} {{introduced}} to require self-support of all <b>resident</b> <b>partners</b> requesting entry for existing or new spouses, including Norwegian citizens above 23  years (who had previously been exempted). The requirement was justified {{as a way to}} reduce welfare dependency and to fight forced marriages, reasoning that it would promote economic integration by incentivizing young immigrants to become self-supporting, and further that a self-supporting person would be better equipped to resist family pressure about whom to marry (Eggebø, 2010, p. 302 – 3; Jordheim, 2008). As Helga Eggebø notes, it is ironic that while the new income requirement was intended to incentivize more resident spouses to be independent of their families’ support, the same rule - by not including incoming spouses’ income in the tally of the required amount – assumed the latter to be dependent on their already <b>resident</b> <b>partners</b> (Eggebø, 2010, p. 304). At the same time, she notes, the new rules further amplified this potential dependence by raising from three to five years the time an imported spouse must remain in a marriage to retain the residence permit (Eggebø, 2013).|$|R

5000|$|The {{judge in}} the case upheld the appeal {{on the basis that}} for the {{purposes}} of the arrangement under the double taxation agreement, a partnership was clearly a [...] "body of persons" [...] in the ordinary sense of the words. This partnership was resident in Jersey, since it was managed and controlled there, and its profits were the industrial or commercial profits of a Jersey enterprise exempt from UK tax. Thus the shares of those profits attributable to UK <b>resident</b> <b>partners</b> were also exempt.|$|R

60|$|While these {{arrangements}} were in {{progress in the}} camp of Captain Bonneville, {{there was a sudden}} bustle and stir in the camp of Fontenelle. One of the partners of the American Fur Company had arrived, in all haste, from the rendezvous at Pierre's Hole, in quest of the supplies. The competition between the two rival companies was just now at its height, and prosecuted with unusual zeal. The tramontane concerns of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company were managed by two <b>resident</b> <b>partners,</b> Fitzpatrick and Bridger; those of the American Fur Company, by Vanderburgh and Dripps. The latter were ignorant of the mountain regions, but trusted to make up by vigilance and activity for their want of knowledge of the country.|$|R
6000|$|The American fur {{companies}} keep no established posts {{beyond the}} mountains. Everything there is regulated by resident partners; {{that is to}} say, partners who reside in the tramontane country, but who move about from place to place, either with Indian tribes, whose traffic they wish to monopolize, or with main bodies of their own men, whom they employ in trading and trapping. In the meantime, they detach bands, or [...] "brigades" [...] as they are termed, of trappers in various directions, assigning to each a portion of country as a hunting or trapping ground. In the months of June and July, {{when there is an}} interval between the hunting seasons, a general rendezvous is held, at some designated place in the mountains, where the affairs of the past year are settled by the <b>resident</b> <b>partners,</b> and the plans for the following year arranged.|$|R
