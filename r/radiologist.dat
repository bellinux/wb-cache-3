5|$|The {{damaging}} {{effects of}} ionising radiation were not {{known at the}} time of her work, which had been carried out without the safety measures later developed. She had carried test tubes containing radioactive isotopes in her pocket, and she stored them in her desk drawer, remarking on the faint light that the substances gave off in the dark. Curie was also exposed to X-rays from unshielded equipment while serving as a <b>radiologist</b> in field hospitals during the war. Although her many decades of exposure to radiation caused chronic illnesses (including near-blindness due to cataracts) and ultimately her death, she never really acknowledged the health risks of radiation exposure.|$|E
5|$|The {{dangers of}} {{radiation}} poisoning had become well-known {{due to the}} experience of the radium dial painters. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve radioactive materials on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about the health and safety aspects. Robert S. Stone, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, was recruited to head the Metallurgical Project's health and safety program. Simeon Cutler, a <b>radiologist,</b> assumed responsibility for radiation safety in Chicago, before moving on to head the program at the Hanford Site. Groves appointed Stafford L. Warren from the University of Rochester as head of the Manhattan Project's Medical Section. Over time, the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous.|$|E

5|$|On August 10, 2001, on remand {{from the}} Florida Second District Court of Appeal, Judge Greer heard a motion from the Schindlers {{claiming}} that new medical treatment could restore sufficient cognitive ability such that Terri Schiavo herself {{would be able}} to decide to continue life-prolonging measures. The court also heard motions from the Schindlers to remove the guardian (Michael Schiavo) and to require Judge Greer to recuse himself. Judge Greer denied the motions and the Schindlers appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. On October 17, 2001 the Court of Appeal affirmed the denials of the motions to remove and recuse. The Court of Appeals acknowledged that their opinion misled the trial court, and they remanded the question of Terri Schiavo's wishes back to the trial court and required an evidentiary hearing to be held. The court specified that five board certified neurologists were to testify. The Schindlers were allowed to choose two doctors to present findings at an evidentiary hearing while Michael Schiavo could introduce two rebuttal experts. Finally, the trial court itself would appoint a new independent physician to examine and evaluate Terri Schiavo's condition. (These decisions, all published in a single order by the Florida Second District Court of Appeal, came to be known by the court as Schiavo III in its later rulings.) In October 2002, on remand by the Second District Court of Appeal, an evidentiary hearing was held in Judge Greer's court to determine whether new therapy treatments could help Terri Schiavo restore any cognitive function. In preparation for the trial, a new computed axial tomography scan (CAT scan) was performed, which showed severe cerebral atrophy. An EEG showed no measurable brain activity. The five physicians chosen were Dr. William Maxfield, a <b>radiologist,</b> and four neurologists: Dr. William Hammesfahr, Dr. Ronald Cranford, Dr. Melvin Greer and Dr. Peter Bambakidis.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The ACR Commission on Human Resources {{continues}} to conduct its annual electronic survey {{to better understand}} the present workforce scenario for <b>radiologists.</b> Methods The Practice of Radiology Environment Database was used to identify group leads, who were asked to complete an electronic survey developed by the Commission on Human Resources. The survey asked group leaders to report the number of <b>radiologists</b> they currently employ or supervise, the number hired in 2014, and the numbers they plan to hire in 2015 and 2018. The leaders were asked to report the subspecialty area used as the main reason for hiring each physician, as well as the ages and genders of their current workforce. Results Thirty-two percent of group leaders responded to the survey, corresponding to 12, 079 <b>radiologists</b> or 39 % of all practicing <b>radiologists.</b> Twenty-one percent of the workforce is female and 79 % is male. Ten percent of <b>radiologists</b> older than 65 years are women, while 32 % younger than 35 are women. Twelve percent of <b>radiologists</b> work part-time, corresponding to a breakdown of 10 % of men and 24 % of women working part-time. The current workforce is 13 % general <b>radiologists</b> and 87 % subspecialists. In 2015, a projected 1, 131 to 1, 484 jobs will be available for <b>radiologists.</b> Conclusions Job opportunities for <b>radiologists</b> seem to be increasing compared with 2013 and are relatively similar to 2014. <b>Radiologists</b> continue to subspecialize in greater numbers, but only 39 % of <b>radiologists</b> practice more than 50 % of the time in their subspecialties...|$|R
40|$|STUDY DESIGN: A {{cross-sectional}} {{diagnostic study}} was conducted in two sessions. OBJECTIVE: To determine and compare {{the reliability and validity of}} contraindications to chiropractic treatment (infections, malignancies, inflammatory spondylitis, and spondylolysis-listhesis) detected by chiropractors, chiropractic <b>radiologists,</b> and medical <b>radiologists</b> on plain lumbosacral radiographs. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Plain radiography of the spine is an established part of chiropractic practice. Few studies have assessed the ability of chiropractors to read plain radiographs. METHODS: Five chiropractors, three chiropractic <b>radiologists</b> and five medical <b>radiologists</b> read a set of 300 blinded lumbosacral radiographs, 50 of which showed an abnormality (prevalence, 16. 7 %), in two sessions. The results were expressed in terms of reliability (percentage and kappa) and validity (sensitivity and specificity). RESULTS: The interobserver agreement in the first session showed generalized kappas of 0. 44 for the chiropractors, 0. 55 for the chiropractic <b>radiologists,</b> and 0. 60 for the medical <b>radiologists.</b> The intraobserver agreement showed mean kappas of 0. 58, 0. 68, and 0. 72, respectively. The difference between the chiropractic <b>radiologists</b> and medical <b>radiologists</b> was not significant. However, there was a difference between the chiropractors and the other professional groups. The mean sensitivity and specificity of the first round, respectively was 0. 86 and 0. 88 for the chiropractors, 0. 90 and 0. 84 for the chiropractic <b>radiologists,</b> and 0. 84 and 0. 92 for the medical <b>radiologists.</b> No differences in the sensitivities were found between the professional groups. The medical <b>radiologists</b> were more specific than the others. CONCLUSIONS: Small differences with little clinical relevance were found. All the professional groups could adequately detect contraindications to chiropractic treatment on radiographs. For this indication, there is no reason to restrict interpretation of radiographs to medical <b>radiologists.</b> Good professional relationships between the professions are recommended to facilitate interprofessional consultation in case of doubt by the chiropractors. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|However, {{the results}} imply that {{deployment}} of radiographers as reviewers in CTC is acceptable but <b>radiologists</b> {{would still be}} necessary {{for the evaluation of}} extracolonic findings.

25|$|Barium sulfate is swallowed, which {{because it}} is a radio opaque {{substance}} does not allow the passage of X-rays.

30|$|It {{seems to}} be {{important}} {{for the future of}} the specialty for <b>radiologists</b> to have more contact with patients in the setting of high-cost, high-impact imaging procedures.

However, results of a survey by Margulis and Sostman [2] show that more than a half of the injections of contrast medium in radiological practices are performed by non-physicians. <b>Radiologists</b> are often but by no means always present in the facility during performance of the study and <b>radiologists</b> rarely introduce themselves to the patient. <b>Radiologists</b> should always introduce themselves to patients before any interventional procedure.
