50|$|Telemedicine for {{intensive}} care unit (ICU) rounds: Telemedicine is also being used in some trauma ICUs to reduce the spread of infections. Rounds are usually conducted at hospitals across the country {{by a team of}} approximately ten or more people to include attending physicians, fellows, residents and other clinicians. This group usually moves from bed to bed in a unit discussing each patient. This aids in the transition of care for patients from the night shift to the morning shift, but also serves as an educational experience for new residents to the team. A new approach features the team conducting rounds from a conference room using a video-conferencing system. The trauma attending, residents, fellows, nurses, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists are able to watch a live video stream from the patient's bedside. They can see the vital signs on the monitor, view the settings on the <b>respiratory</b> <b>ventilator,</b> and/or view the patient's wounds. Video-conferencing allows the remote viewers two-way communication with clinicians at the bedside.|$|E
40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} {{a single case}} of Systemic Capillary Leak Syndrome (SCLS) with a rare complication of compartment syndrome. Patient. Our patient is a 57 -year-old male, referred to our hospital due to polycythemia (hemoglobin (Hgb) of 220 [*]g/L), hypotension, acute renal failure, and bilateral calf pain. Measurements and Main Results. The patient required bilateral forearm, thigh, and calf fasciotomies during his ICU stay and continuous renal replacement therapy was instituted following onset of acute renal failure and oliguria. Ongoing hemodynamic (Norepinephrine and Milrinone infusion) and <b>respiratory</b> (<b>ventilator)</b> support in the ICU was provided until resolution of intravascular fluid extravasation. Conclusions. SCLS is an extremely rare disorder characterized by unexplained episodic capillary hyperpermeability, which causes shift of volume and protein from the intravascular space to the interstitial space. Patients present with significant hypotension, hemoconcentration, hypovolemia, and oliguria. Severe edema results from leakage of fluid and proteins into tissue. The {{most important part of}} treatment is maintaining stable hemodynamics, ruling out other causes of shock and diligent monitoring for complications.

40|$|Patients in the {{intensive}} care unit (ICU) and in the peri-operative phase are dependent on physicians and nurses for their fluid intake. Volume status optimization is required to maximize oxygen delivery to vital organs. Unnecessary fluid administration can, however, lead to general and pulmonary oedema, cardiac failure, infections, prolonged hospitalization and death. Besides signs like skin turgor, diuresis and skin colour, hemodynamic measurements like central venous pressure (CVP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) are most often used for hemodynamic management. These parameters, however, often fail to accurately predict the response of a patient to fluid loading. Cardiac output (CO) is the amount of blood pumped through the circulation by the heart per minute. The general conception is that an increase in cardiac output will improve perfusion of vital organs. Increased flow might also imply improved oxygen delivery to the tissues. This is the basis of the fluid loading responsiveness strategy (FLR). This strategy aims to prevent fluid overloading by an accurate prediction of the response in cardiac output to fluid loading. Arthur Guyton’s work provided an important step forward to the determination of volume status directly. Together with the shape of cardiac output function curve, dimensions of the vascular system, blood viscosity and mean systemic filling pressure (MSFP) can be considered as a primary determinant of venous return and thus cardiac output. Ultimately, MSFP can be used to calculate stressed volume and, hence, quantify effective volume status in a specific patient. In this thesis, we review literature on fluid loading responsiveness research, we try to assess the impact of literature on hemodynamic management in Dutch ICU’s, we discuss a novel method to assess mean systemic filling pressure and last we discuss studies performed to assess the reliability of several challenges to predict FLR; + 10 cmH 2 O PEEP, the fluid challenge, passive leg raising, the <b>respiratory</b> <b>ventilator</b> manoeuvre and the measurement of baseline MSFP. The manoeuvres are aimed at determining the working point of the circulation on the Frank- Starling curve. It is assumed that when the patient is on the ascending portion of the Frank- Starling curve an (auto) transfusion will increase cardiac output. Promotor: L. P. H. J. Aarts, Co-promotor: J. R. C.

40|$|OBJECTIVE:: Selected optimal {{respiratory}} cycles {{should allow}} calculation of respiratory mechanic parameters focusing on patient-ventilator interaction. New computer software automatically selecting optimal breaths and respiratory mechanic derived from those cycles are evaluated. DESIGN:: Retrospective study. SETTING:: University level III {{neonatal intensive care}} unit. SUBJECTS:: Ten mins synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation and assist/control ventilation recordings from ten newborns. INTERVENTION:: The <b>ventilator</b> provided <b>respiratory</b> mechanic data (<b>ventilator</b> <b>respiratory</b> cycles) every 10 secs. Pressure, flow, and volume waves and pressure volume, pressure flow, and ventilator volume flow loops were reconstructed from continuous pressure/volume recordings. Visual assessment determined assisted leak-free optimal respiratory cycles (selected respiratory cycles). New software graded the quality of cycles (automated respiratory cycles). Respiratory mechanic values were derived from both sets of optimal cycles. We evaluated quality selection and compared mean values and their variability according to ventilatory mode and respiratory mechanic provenance. To assess discriminating power, all 45 "t" values obtained from interpatient comparisons were compared for each respiratory mechanic parameter. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:: A total of 11, 724 breaths are evaluated. automated respiratory cycle/selected respiratory cycle selections agreement is high: 88 % of maximal kappa with linear weighting. Specificity and positive predictive values are 0. 98 and 0. 96, respectively. Averaged values are similar between automated <b>respiratory</b> cycle and <b>ventilator</b> <b>respiratory</b> cycle. C 20 /C alone is markedly decreased in automated respiratory cycle (1. 27 +/- 0. 37 vs. 1. 81 +/- 0. 67). Tidal volume apparent similarity disappears in assist/control: automated respiratory cycle tidal volume (4. 8 +/- 1. 0 mL/kg) is significantly lower than for <b>ventilator</b> <b>respiratory</b> cycle (5. 6 +/- 1. 8 mL/kg). Coefficients of variation decrease for all automated respiratory cycle parameters in all infants. "t" values from <b>ventilator</b> <b>respiratory</b> cycle data are {{two to three times}} higher than <b>ventilator</b> <b>respiratory</b> cycles. CONCLUSIONS:: Automated selection is highly specific. Automated respiratory cycle reflects most the interaction of both ventilator and patient. Improving discriminating power of ventilator monitoring will likely help in assessing disease status and following trends.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} neurodevelopmental outcome until 2 {{years of}} age in children who participated in a multicenter antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) trial to improve respiratory outcome and to lower mortality. METHODS: Neurodevelopmental outcome was studied in infants whose mothers were admitted to the Academic Medical Center and enrolled in the European Antenatal TRH trial. Mothers were treated for imminent preterm delivery (before 30 weeks) with corticosteroids plus either placebo (placebo-group) or TRH (TRH-group). TRH treatment consisted of 400 micro g every 8 hours up to 4 doses. Assessments included neurologic development at 12 months and psychomotor development at 12 and 24 months using the Bayley developmental scales. RESULTS: Sixty-two infants were included, 10 of whom died. Of the surviving infants, 24 received TRH and 28 received placebo. Ten infants were lost to follow-up. Each group consisted of 21 infants.

The rapid deterioration of muscular strength and the subsequent worsening <b>respiratory</b> failure necessitated <b>ventilator</b> support within the local Medical Intensive Care Unit. There, the patient showed a prompt normalization of respiratory parameters and a steady improvement of renal function. An inadequate compliance to lifestyle and dietary restriction in VLCAD may trigger severe and potentially lethal crisis. The in-hospital management of these patients calls for early intensive care admission as their conditions may deteriorate without warning...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out in Medicine and Pediatrics Department of Rajshahi Medical College Hospital, and Natore Sadar Hospital, both are located in the {{northern}} territory of Bangladesh. Period of study ranged from admission of patients till discharge. On 8 th June 2008, 83 patients of Singra Upazilla Natore were admitted in Rajshahi Medical College Hospital and Natore Sadar Hospital with the history of consumption of Puffer fish. A presumptive diagnosis of Puffer fish poisoning was {{made on the basis of}} classical clinical presentations followed by Puffer fish ingestion. Blood and urine samples from 38 patients were sent to Frankfurt, Germany for toxicological analysis. The cases were clinically reviewed periodically and routine investigations were done. Report of the toxicological study confirmed the diagnosis of tetrodotoxin poisoning. Important neurological symptoms observed were peri-oral paresthesia (71), tingling over entire body (50), dizziness (35), headache (20). Muscular paralysis of the limbs was noted in 13 patients, of which 7 patients developed respiratory involvement. All the patients who developed respiratory involvement died. Early diagnosis and supportive management could ensure a safe and favorable outcome. Management of <b>respiratory</b> failure by <b>ventilator</b> support can be life saving...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Effects of {{preoperative}} steroids on {{morbidity and}} mortality after transsternal thymectomy are analyzed. Methods: There were 620 transsternal thymectomies for myasthenia gravis performed in the period 1973 – 2002. There were 547 patients with nonthymomatous myasthenia, including 17 patients submitted to repeated thymectomy (rethymectomy) and 46 patients with thymoma. There were 522 upper median sternotomies performed in the period 1973 – 1997 and 98 complete median sternotomies performed in the period 1998 – 2002 (74 patients without thymoma, 7 thymomas and 17 rethymectomies). One hundred and seventeen of these 620 patients were taking steroids preoperatively. The impact of steroids use on postoperative <b>respiratory</b> insufficiency (<b>ventilator),</b> need for tracheostomy, superficial wound dehiscence, superficial wound suppuration, sternal dehiscence and mortality was analyzed. Results: The rate of {{morbidity and mortality}} in the steroids and the no-steroids groups included respiratory insufficiency necessitating the use of a ventilator in 46 / 503 patients from the no-steroids group (9. 1 %) and 8 / 117 patients from the steroids group (6. 8 %; P 0 : 4260), need for tracheostomy in 14 / 503 patients from the no-steroids group (2. 8 %) and 3 / 117 patients from the steroids group (2. 6 %; P 0 : 9054). Complications with wound healing (including sternal dehiscence, superficial wound dehiscence and superficial wound suppuration) occurred in 47 / 503 (9. 3 %) patients from the no-steroids group and in 1 / 117 (0. 9 %) patient from the steroids group ðP 0 : 0023 Þ: The overall complications rate was 30. 6 % (154 / 503) in the no-steroids group and 11. 1 % (13 / 117) in the steroids group ðP 0 : 0001 Þ: Mortality rate in the no-steroids group was 0. 4 % (2 / 503 patients) and none in the steroids group. Morbidity in patients with complete sternotomy was low, respiratory insufficiency in three patients (3. 1 %), and superficia...|$|R
40|$|A {{consecutive}} {{cohort of}} 73 very low birthweight infants was studied {{to determine the}} presence or absence of beat to beat variability in the velocity of blood flow in the cerebral circulation and its relation with respiration. One minute epochs of information included recordings of cerebral blood flow velocity estimated with Doppler ultrasound, blood pressure, spontaneous <b>respiratory</b> activity, and <b>ventilator</b> cycling. Fourier transformation was used to resolve the frequencies present within the one minute epochs and to classify the cerebral blood flow velocity as showing {{the presence or absence}} of any respiratory associated variability. A total of 249 recordings was made on days 1, 2, 3, and 7. Forty seven infants showed respiratory variability in cerebral blood flow velocity on 97 occasions, usually during the first day of life. The infants with respiratory associated variability were of lower gestational age and when the respiratory associated variability was present they were more likely to be ventilated and receiving higher inspired oxygen; these associations were shown to be independent of gestational age. There was no significant independent association with brain injury, cerebral blood flow velocity (cm/s), or blood pressure (mm Hg). The findings suggest that artificial ventilation may entrain normal respiratory associated variability in the cerebral circulation but do not provide evidence that it is harmful...|$|R
