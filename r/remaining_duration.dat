25|$|A {{risk score}} of four points or higher means {{prophylaxis}} in the ante partum period is needed, {{as well as}} at least six weeks post partum. A previous distal DVT indicates a minimum of 12 weeks (three months) of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. A previous proximal DVT or pulmonary embolism requires a minimum of 26 weeks (6.5 months) of therapy If the therapy duration reaches delivery time, the <b>remaining</b> <b>duration</b> may be given after delivery, possibly extending the minimum of six weeks of post partum therapy. In a very high risk, high-dose ante partum prophylaxis should be continued at least 12 weeks after delivery.|$|E
25|$|Augustus {{installed}} Tigranes V as king of Armenia in AD 6, but ruled with Erato of Armenia. The Romans then installed Mithridates of Armenia as client king. Mithridates {{was arrested}} by Caligula, but later restored by Claudius. Subsequently, Armenia was often a focus of contention between Rome and Parthia, with both major powers supporting opposing sovereigns and usurpers. The Parthians forced Armenia into submission in AD 37, but in AD 47 the Romans retook control of the kingdom. In AD 51 Armenia fell to an Iberian invasion sponsored by Parthia, led by Rhadamistus. Tigranes VI of Armenia ruled from AD 58, again installed by Roman support. The period of turmoil ends in AD 66, when Tiridates I of Armenia was crowned king of Armenia by Nero. For the <b>remaining</b> <b>duration</b> of the Armenian kingdom, Rome still considered it a client kingdom de jure, but the ruling dynasty was of Parthian extraction, and contemporary Roman writers thought that Nero had de facto yielded Armenia to the Parthians.|$|E
30|$|When an MMP {{wants to}} {{establish}} MDAOP, it may find according to NMST {{that all of}} the <b>remaining</b> <b>durations</b> on each channel cannot meet the MDAOP size. However, after checking NMST, we will find that some channels’ total remaining time slots can meet the MDAOP, which is caused by serious fragmentation on every channel. To avoid the waste of channel space, we use MDAOP relocation mechanism to deal with. However, to avoid too complex relocation action, resulting in too many MDAOPs to be moved, we hope to move only one MDAOP to solve this problem instead.|$|R

Each machine operates within an indefinite service time. There is much data available on modeling {{and analysis of the}} transfer lines.

According to the method, we chart the system operation process; calculate of distribution formula for the <b>remaining</b> <b>durations</b> of time period of the system being in the states marked at the chart.

25|$|However, {{after the}} second half began, the game took on a {{different}} complexion as Dublin seized the lead by scoring three consecutive points. However, Mayo reclaimed the lead early into the half as Lee Keegan scored a goal to put his team one point ahead. The talking point of the match occurred in the 48th minute, as Dublin's John Small, who had previously received a yellow card in the first half, was sent off for a foul on Colm Boyle. However, Donal Vaughan of Mayo was also sent off after striking Small in the face {{in retaliation for the}} foul. This left both teams reduced to fourteen men for the <b>remaining</b> <b>duration</b> of the game. After seventy minutes of the game had elapsed, the teams were tied at 1-16 apiece, and it appeared that the game was destined for a draw and replay. In the seventy-first minute, Mayo were awarded a kickable free and an opportunity to go ahead. Cillian O'Connor, who had missed a free under a similar scenario in the previous final, took the kick, and missed, having it strike the post and rebound away from goal. Ciarán Kilkenny was given a black card by the referee for cynical play. Then, with a mere minute of the six additional minutes remaining, Diarmuid Connolly was fouled approximately forty-five metres from the Mayo goal, leaving Dublin with a kick to win the game. Dean Rock, the son of Barney Rock, {{one of the most famous}} Gaelic footballers from the capital, took the free. Lee Keegan controversially threw a GPS device at Rock as he took the free, yet the Dubliner was undeterred and converted. This left the defending champions one point ahead, and after reclaiming the ball from the Mayo kick-out, Dublin maintained possession until the final whistle was blown. Stephen Cluxton, the Dublin captain, then lifted the Sam Maguire Cup for the fifth time in seven years.|$|E

40|$|Operating Room (OR) {{scheduling}} {{is crucial}} to allow efficient use of ORs. Currently, the predicted durations of surgical procedures are unreliable and the OR schedulers have to follow {{the progress of the}} procedures in order to update the daily planning accordingly. The OR schedulers often acquire the needed information through verbal communication with the OR staff, which causes undesired interruptions of the surgical process. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a system that predicts in real-time the <b>remaining</b> procedure <b>duration</b> and to test this prediction system for reliability and usability in an OR. The prediction system was based on the activation pattern of one single piece of equipment, the electrosurgical device. The prediction system was tested during 21 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, in which the activation of the electrosurgical device was recorded and processed in real-time using pattern recognition methods. The <b>remaining</b> surgical procedure <b>duration</b> was estimated and the optimal timing to prepare the next patient for surgery was communicated to the OR staff. The mean absolute error was smaller for the prediction system (14  min) than for the OR staff (19  min). The OR staff doubted whether the prediction system could take all relevant factors into account but were positive about its potential to shorten waiting times for patients. The prediction system is a promising tool to automatically and objectively predict the <b>remaining</b> procedure <b>duration,</b> and thereby achieve optimal OR scheduling and streamline the patient flow from the nursing department to the OR. </p...|$|R
40|$|Online {{prediction}} of incident <b>duration</b> (i. e., <b>remaining</b> incident <b>duration)</b> {{is becoming more}} important as more intelligent transportation system deployments in the United States focus on improving the operations of transportation management centers. This study proposed a time sequential procedure where an incident management process is divided into stages according to the specific information available. For each stage, a hazard-based duration regression model with different variables representing the available information was developed. By calibrating these models, the parameters of probability distributions assumed for incident duration and the coefficients of the variables were jointly estimated. Based on the estimated parameters and coefficients, <b>remaining</b> incident <b>duration</b> can be predicted online using the truncated median of incident duration. This study concluded that {{the accuracy of the}} {{prediction of}} incident duration increases as more information is incorporated into the developed models. The prediction based on the truncated median is more accurate than that based on the truncated mean because the probability distribution of incident duration has a long tail. The proposed procedure provides flexibility for implementation in the real world...|$|R
