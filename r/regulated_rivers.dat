40|$|Most of the worldâs large river flows are {{regulated}} by dams, altering {{the processes that}} sustain riparian ecosystem biodiversity and function. Numerous studies have documented declines in riparian vegetation extent and diversity along <b>regulated</b> <b>rivers.</b> Many reservoirs in large river systems, now decades old, are beginning to show their ages {{by the appearance of}} expanding delta formations at river/reservoir and tributary/ reservoir junctions. These deltas are novel habitats that were not present in the former river system, and are governed by both river flow and sediment regimes and managed reservoir level fluctuations. Although largely unstudied, available evidence suggests that these delta habitats may support native riparian vegetation that is in decline elsewhere along <b>regulated</b> <b>rivers.</b> The delta formed at the confluence of the White River and Fort Randall Reservoir on the Missouri River in South Dakota represents a novel habitat where riparian forest has expanded during the post-dam era; however, expansion may be curtailed at times by high stages of Fort Randall Reservoir that cause forest mortality. Time-series analysis of riverine cross-sections indicated {{that there has been a}} trend of channel and floodplain aggradation within the post-dam delta, facilitating expansion of delta surfaces into and above the reservoir pool. Likewise, GIS analysis of historic aerial photography showed that forest area on the delta increased by about 50 percent during the post-dam era. Field inventories determined that a heterogeneous mixture of riparian forest exists within the White River delta, and that these forests are similar in structure and composition to those along natural river reaches.

Moreover, the decreasing trends of runoff for most months were significant in Shaying River, although the trend of monthly precipitation decreased significantly only in April in the whole research area {{and the number of}} months in the dry season having significantly decreasing trends in runoff was more than that in the wet season. (2) The rainfall-runoff relationship was significant in both highly <b>regulated</b> <b>river</b> and less-regulated <b>river.</b> In <b>regulated</b> <b>river,</b> the reservoirs have larger regulation capacity than the floodgates and thus have the smaller correlation coefficient and t-value.

Within Great Britain, two sudden releases of water to the in removing within-channel accumulations of out of every five major reservoirs cause regulated river. Reservoir releases also provide, with their fixed and constant discharges, a unique opportunity to undertake field experiments investigating the importance of channel suspended solids sources, suspended solids supply limitation, the nature of the suspended solids load on turbidity and flow routing within upland boulder bed channels. The reservoir release suspended solids loads relate to sediment source depletion and changing sources along the channel. Close to theÂ· dam, suspended loads are usually small with fine organic matter dominating the seston, which. scanning electron microscopy revealed to be predominantly autochthonous organic matter, with algal fragments derived from extensive and Â·rapid periphyton growth within the <b>regulated</b> <b>rivers.</b> Downstream, minerogenic particles dominate the seston. This represents the flushing of channel bed accumulations derived fromÂ· unregulated tributaries. Seasonal variation {{in the nature of the}} suspended solids loads is also revealed.

Marked hysteresis between suspended solids transport and discharge was characteristic on all the <b>regulated</b> <b>rivers.</b> In addition, hysteresis in the relationship between turbidity and suspended solids concentrations was also apparent, this relating to spatial and temporal changes in seston composition.

Multi-criteria model evaluation demonstrated that the model performed well in capturing the dominant catchment processes and regulation effects, especially at the timescales at which operation rules apply. The main change {{as a result of}} regulation in the river Lyon is a decrease in inter-annual and intra-annual variability of all elements of the flow regime, in terms of magnitude, frequency, and duration. Although these impacts are most pronounced directly downstream of the impoundments, the regulation effects propagate throughout the river system. The modelling approach is flexible and widely applicable and only limited amounts of data are required. Moreover, results are easily communicated to stakeholders.

40|$|Tidal {{currents}} and rivers are promising sources {{of renewable energy}} given that suitable turbines for kinetic energy conversion are developed. To be economically and technically feasible, a velocity distribution that can give {{a high degree of}} utilization (or capacity factor), while the ratio of maximum to rated velocity is low would be preferable. The rated velocity is defined as the velocity at which rated power is achieved. Despite many attempts to estimate the resource, however, reports on the possible degree of utilisation from tidal {{currents and}} rivers are scarce. In this paper the velocity distribution from a number of <b>regulated</b> <b>rivers,</b> unregulated rivers and tidal currents have been analysed regarding the degree of utilisation, the fraction of converted energy and the ratio of maximum to rated velocity. Two methods have been used for choosing the rated velocity; one aiming at a high fraction of converted energy and one aiming at a high degree of utilisation. Using the first method, with a rated velocity close to the maximum velocity, {{it is unlikely that the}} turbine will reach the cut-out velocity. This results in, on average, a degree of utilisation of 23 % for <b>regulated</b> <b>rivers,</b> 19 % for unregulated rivers and 17 % for tidal currents while converting roughly 30 - 40 % of the kinetic energy. Choosing a rated velocity closer to the mean velocity resulted in, on average, a degree of utilisation of 57 % for <b>regulated</b> <b>rivers,</b> 52 % for unregulated rivers and 45 % for tidal currents. The ratio of maximum to rated velocity would still be no higher than 2. 0 for <b>regulated</b> <b>rivers,</b> 1. 2 for unregulated rivers and 1. 6 for tidal currents. This implies that the velocity distribution of both rivers and tidal currents is promising for kinetic energy conversion.

Furthermore, comparisons in space use between day and night time and between rivers and seasons between the <b>regulated</b> <b>river</b> were investigated. A total of 90 smÃ¥blank were tagged in three separate periods (SnÃ¥samoen: autumn 2014 n = 33 and spring 2015 n = 20, Mellingselva: autumn 2015 n = 36). Of the total number of radio tagged smÃ¥blank were 35 individuals randomly selected for radio tracking over a period of 4 to 5 months. The selected individuals were then used for home range analysis (SnÃ¥samoen: autumn n = 15, SnÃ¥samoen: spring n = 6, Mellingselva: autumn n = 16). Home ranges were significantly larger in the <b>regulated</b> <b>river</b> in both seasons, compared to the non-regulated tributary (SnÃ¥samoen: autumn mean = 21 715 m 2 and spring mean = 29 688 m 2, Mellingselva: autumn mean = 2 362 m 2). The condition factor of fish tagged at SnÃ¥samoen was significantly lower than of those tagged in Mellingselva, despite similar body length. The fish with same body length did in addition have significantly larger home range at SnÃ¥samoen than Mellingselva, which can result in smÃ¥blank having to utilise larger areas to obtain their body condition. The body conditions in spring were significantly lower than in autumn at SnÃ¥samoen, which may be caused by a reduction in body mass during winter. The length of river stretch used was longer when considering only day time locations (SnÃ¥samoen: autumn mean = 301 m and spring mean = 191 m, Mellingselva: autumn mean = 116 m) than when considering only night time locations between rivers and between seasons (SnÃ¥samoen: autumn mean = 104 m and spring mean = 136 m, Mellingselva: autumn mean = 91 m). The fish utilised areas with larger particle sizes in Mellingselva than at SnÃ¥samoen, resulting in more shelter availability. Mellingselva had in general faster flowing water velocities which is often more preferred to Atlantic salmon than slower velocities found at SnÃ¥samoen. In conclusion, the area investigated in the non-regulated tributary seemed better suited for 3 and 4 years old smÃ¥blank, than the <b>regulated</b> <b>River</b> Namsen at SnÃ¥samoen.
