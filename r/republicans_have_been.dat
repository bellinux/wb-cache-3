5|$|From {{the close}} of the Civil War until 1895, Kentuckians elected a series of Bourbon Democrats with Confederate sympathies as governor, {{including}} two men—James B. McCreary and Simon Bolivar Buckner—who had served in the Confederate States Army. The Democratic dominance was broken by William O'Connell Bradley, who was elected the state's first Republican governor in 1895. Bradley's election marked the beginning of thirty years of true, two-party competition for the governorship in the state. Between 1895 and 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor. Since 1931, however, the <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> unable to preserve this level of parity, and in that period only four of the twenty elected governors have been from the Republican party, including incumbent Matt Bevin.|$|E

25|$|As {{with most}} urban districts, Colorado's 1st Congressional District is racially diverse and {{has proven to}} be {{friendly}} territory for Democrats. Only two <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> elected to the district's Congressional seat since the Great Depression. Dean M. Gillespie was the district's representative from 1944 to 1947, and Mike McKevitt served one term from 1970 to 1972, winning thanks to an ideological split among Denver Democrats.|$|E
25|$|Most Republican {{strength}} traditionally lied {{mainly in}} the northwestern part of the state, particularly Fort Smith and Bentonville, as well as North Central Arkansas around the Mountain Home area. In the latter area, <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> known to get 90 {{percent or more of}} the vote, while the rest of the state was more Democratic. After 2010, Republican strength expanded further to the Northeast and Southwest and into the Little Rock suburbs. The Democrats are mostly concentrated to central Little Rock, the Mississippi Delta, the Pine Bluff area, and the areas around the southern border with Louisiana.|$|E

25|$|The city is {{overwhelmingly}} Democratic. In 2015, of the town's 68,555 voters, 70% were registered as Democrats, and 3% were registered as Republicans; 26% were unaffiliated. The board of alders {{is dominated by}} Democrats; no <b>Republican</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a New Haven alder since 2011.|$|R
25|$|In recent decades, <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{moderately}} {{successful in}} gaining support from Hispanic and Asian American voters. George W. Bush, who campaigned energetically for Hispanic votes, received 35% of their vote in 2000 and 44% in 2004. The party's strong anti-communist stance {{has made it}} popular among some minority groups from current and former Communist states, in particular Cuban Americans, Korean Americans, Chinese Americans, and Vietnamese Americans. The election of Bobby Jindal as Governor of Louisiana has been hailed as pathbreaking. He is the first elected minority governor in Louisiana and the first state governor of Indian descent. According to John Avlon in 2013, the Republican party is more diverse at the statewide elected official level than the Democratic Party, including Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval and South Carolina Senator Tim Scott.|$|E
25|$|<b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> winning under 15% of {{the black}} vote in recent {{national}} elections (1980 to 2016). While historically the party had been supporters of rights for African Americans starting in the 1860s, it lost its leadership position in the 1960s. The party abolished slavery under Abraham Lincoln, defeated the Slave Power, and gave blacks the legal right to vote during Reconstruction in the late 1860s. Until the New Deal of the 1930s, blacks supported the Republican Party by large margins. Black voters shifted to the Democratic Party beginning in the 1930s, when major Democratic figures such as Eleanor Roosevelt began to support civil rights, and the New Deal offered them employment opportunities. They became one of the core components of the New Deal Coalition. In the South, after the Voting Rights Act to prohibit racial discrimination in elections was passed by a bipartisan coalition in 1965, blacks were able to vote again and ever since have formed a significant portion (20–50%) of the Democratic vote in that region.|$|E
25|$|While {{only five}} Democratic presidential nominees have carried Indiana since 1900, 11 Democrats were elected {{governor}} during that time. Before Mitch Daniels became governor in 2005, Democrats {{had held the}} office for 16consecutive years. Indiana elects two senators and nine representatives to Congress. The state has 11electoral votes in presidential elections. Seven of the districts favor the Republican Party according to the CPVI rankings; there are currently seven Republicans serving as representatives and two Democrats. Historically, <b>Republicans</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> strongest in the eastern and central portions of the state, while Democrats have been strongest in the northwestern part of the state. Occasionally, certain counties {{in the southern part}} of the state will vote Democratic. Marion County, Indiana's most populous county, supported the Republican candidates from 1968 to 2000, before backing the Democrats in the 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016 elections. Indiana's second most populous county, Lake County, strongly supports the Democratic party and has not voted for a Republican since 1972. In 2005, the Bay Area Center for Voting Research rated the most liberal and conservative cities in the United States on voting statistics in the 2004presidential election, based on 237cities with populations of more than 100,000. Five Indiana cities were mentioned in the study. On the liberal side, Gary was ranked second and South Bend came in at 83. Among conservative cities, Fort Wayne was 44th, Evansville was 60th and Indianapolis was 82nd on the list.|$|E

He switched parties early in the 1990s to express his opposition to U.S. President Bill Clinton. He was thereafter groomed for state leadership by the GOP hierarchy.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} during this era, that the Republican Party's {{domination}} of the district was broken. Democrat John Abner Race, represented the district from 1965 to 1967. Other than this brief interruption, a <b>Republican</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> sent to Washington, D.C. in every election since 1938.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Historical graph {{of party}} {{control of the}} Senate, House, and Presidency.
