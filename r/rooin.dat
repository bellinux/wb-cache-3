The cliannel impulse response ancl the facliiig cliaracteristics {{in the frequency}} domain and the spatial domain are measured. Fiutlierniore, a 11 iiidication is given {{of the effect of}} building attenuation. From Iiieasureiiieiits in tlie urban area of Eiiidlioveii, it appears that no significant cliffereiice can be observed in the echo profiles witli indoor or outdoor reception witlioiit line-of-sight. hi both cases, strong echoes (up to 30 dB weaker than tlie main sipal) are observed with delays up to 5 - 10 p. Tliis corresponds very well with the oiitcoiiie of COST- 207. Building penetration loss is due to atteiiuatioii or shielding of the radio signals by walls, floors aid ceilings. Using over 300 ineasureiiieiit ruis iii different <b>rooins</b> at differerit floors in 40 residential houses, apartment biiildiiigs and office buildings iii Eiiicilioveii, the l~iulcling penetration loss at 762 MHz can be determined.

30|$|Recently, Dehghan and <b>Rooin</b> [7] {{introduced}} the duality mapping in CAT(0) spaces and studied its relation with subdifferential {{by using the}} concept of quasilinearization. Then they presented a characterization of a metric projection in CAT(0) spaces as follows.|$|E
40|$|The {{strengths}} of metallic multilayers, composed of alternating layers o f soft metals such as Cu and Nb, approach the theoretical limit of material strengih when the bilayer periods {{are on the}} order of a few nanometers. We have investigated the damage mechanisms in these ultra-high strength nanolayered composite inaterials subjected to monotonic deformation. Large strain plastic deformation such as <b>rooin</b> temperature rolling does not lead to any dislocation cell structure formation within the layers indicating that the deformation and dislocation storage mechanisms in nanostructured materials are completely different from the bulk. In bulk metals, dislocation pile-ups lead to heterogeneous slip, but in nano-materials, deformation by single disloqations on closely spaced glide planes results in more homogeneously distributed slip. The implications of the high tensile strengths and hoinogencous slip on the fatigue properties of nanolayered materials are also discussed...|$|E
