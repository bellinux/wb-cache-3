5|$|However, OZ users {{worldwide}} enter their own accounts into the wager on Natsuki's side, which also prompts the guardian programs of OZ—the {{blue and red}} whales known as John and Yoko—to upgrade Natsuki's account. Natsuki wagers the 150 million avatars given {{to her in a}} single hand and critically damages Love Machine, prompting the artificial intelligence to <b>redirect</b> the Arawashi towards Sakae's estate. Kenji attempts to break into the probe's GPS, while Wabisuke disables Love Machine's defenses. After being revived and assisted by several of the Jinnouchi family's avatars, King Kazma destroys Love Machine. Kenji activates the GPS code to <b>redirect</b> the Arawashi away from the estate, destroying the estate's entrance and causing a geyser to erupt. In the aftermath, the Jinnouchi family, celebrating their victory as well as Sakae's birthday, has Natsuki kiss Kenji after they confess their love to each other.|$|E

Although <b>redirects</b> {{make up a}} ma-jority of all article pages in English Wikipedia, they have attracted very little attention and are rarely taken into ac-count by researchers. This note describes <b>redirects</b> and illus-trates why they {{play an important role}} in shaping activity in Wikipedia.

40|$|Background: Tumors can be {{targeted}} by the adoptive transfer of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) <b>redirected</b> T-cells. Antigen-specific expansion protocols are needed to generate large quantities of <b>redirected</b> T-cells. We aimed to establish a protocol to expand functional active NY-ESO- 1 -specific <b>redirected</b> human CD 8 + T-cells. Materials and Methods: The anti-idiotypic Fab antibody A 4 with specificity for HLA-A* 0201 /NY-ESO- 1157 - 165 was tested by competition assays using a HLA-A* 0201 /NY-ESO- 1157 - 165 tetramer. HLA-A* 0201 /NY-ESO- 1157 - 165 <b>redirected</b> T-cells were generated, expanded and tested for CAR expression, cytokine release, in vitro cytolysis and protection against xenografted HLA-A* 0201 /NY-ESO- 1157 - 165 –positive multiple myeloma cells. Results: A 4 demonstrated antigen-specific binding to HLA-A* 0201 /NY-ESO- 1157 - 165 <b>redirected</b> T-cells. Expansion with A 4 resulted in 98 % of HLA-A* 0201 /NY-ESO- 1157 - 165 <b>redirected</b> T-cells. A 4 induced strong proliferation, resulting in a 300 -fold increase of <b>redirected</b> T-cells. After expansion protocols, <b>redirected</b> T-cells secreted Interleukin- 2, (IL- 2), interferon gamma (IFNγ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and lysed target cells in vitro and were protective in vivo. Conclusion: A 4 expanded HLA-A* 0201 /NY-ESO- 1157 - 165 <b>redirected</b> T-cells with preservation of antigen-specific function...|$|R

5|$|The {{conversion}} to meat was unfavorable for the Auxois, however. The Percheron was preferred {{for the quality}} of the meat and the Ardennais and closely related Auxois were considered to have some of the lowest quality meat. In addition, the promised market for horse meat did not materialize, and French slaughterhouses were overwhelmed by imports of cheap horses from the Americas and Eastern Europe. Because of this lack of profitability, the population of most French breeds, including the Auxois, continued to decline until 1994. The collapse in prices then forced the National Stud to <b>redirect</b> its draft horse-related activities.|$|E
5|$|The {{periscopes}} had two problems, {{the first}} of which was shared with the other masts. They were not streamlined; raising a periscope while moving would create enough drag and turbulence to shake the entire submarine. As with many elements of the submarine, there were disagreements as to who was responsible for the problem. It was solved by modifying the masts to <b>redirect</b> the water flow around them (for example, a spiral wrap was fixed around the head of each periscope).|$|E
5|$|After Ueshiba left Hokkaidō in 1919, he met and {{was profoundly}} {{influenced}} by Onisaburo Deguchi, the {{spiritual leader of}} the Ōmoto-kyō religion (a neo-Shinto movement) in Ayabe.

This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to {{those who seek to}} harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly <b>redirect</b> it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.|$|E

Having been in collaboration with Soviet Intelligence all along, Drax and his henchman attempt to escape by Russian submarine—only to be killed as the vessel flees through the waters onto which the Moonraker has been re-targeted. After their debriefing at headquarters, Bond meets up with Brand, expecting her company—but they part ways after she reveals that she is engaged to a fellow Special Branch officer.|$|E

Initially offering the garrison at Dagnum the opportunity to surrender, he promptly besieged the fortress upon rejection. In order to pressure the Venetians, Skanderbeg also turned towards Durazzo, then another possession of Venetian Albania, and cut the city off from their local resources and trade.

Her 1987 paper, written to support the campaign, argued that the well-recognized right to refuse military service on grounds of conscience should be extended to include the right to refuse to pay taxes for war preparations. Franklin asserted that the freedom of conscience provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaranteed this form of conscientious objection. Her paper was {{to be part of}} an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The lower courts had convicted those withholding part of their taxes of violating the Income Tax Act. In 1990 however, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.|$|E

5|$|Issues {{specific}} to his South Coast and Cape Cod–based district, such as maritime policy, {{have been a}} major target of Keating's work. In June 2012, he organized the Federal Fishing Advisory Board, a body to research and address fisheries management concerns between lawmakers and industry stakeholders. In 2012 he and his Massachusetts peers successfully pushed the Commerce Department to issue a federal disaster declaration for fisheries in the northeastern U.S., which would open up the opportunity for financial aid. In the wake of Hurricane Sandy, he proposed to <b>redirect</b> $111 million of relief funding to fisheries throughout the country, although the proposal was not adopted by the House Rules Committee.|$|E
5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the project was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected to the plan {{on the basis that}} it would interfere with the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to <b>redirect</b> the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase in cost. Residents in inner-city suburbs such as St Peters were concerned about the noise of the light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister.|$|E
5|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} in English law {{is an element}} of trusts law dealing with charitable trusts. The doctrine provides that when such a trust has failed because its purposes are either impossible or cannot be fulfilled, the High Court of Justice or Charity Commission can make an order redirecting the trust's funds to the nearest possible purpose. For charities with a worth under £5,000 and no land, the trustees (by a two-thirds majority) may make the decision to <b>redirect</b> the trust's funds. The doctrine was initially an element of ecclesiastical law, coming from the Norman French cy près comme possible (as close as possible), but similar and possibly ancestral provisions have been found in Roman law, both in the Corpus Juris Civilis and later Byzantine law.|$|E
