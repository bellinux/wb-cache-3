The CMERI-CoEFM was {{established}} as Mechanical Engineering Research & Development Organization (MERADO) at Ludhiana {{as an extension}} center of CMERI {{to concentrate on the}} technology development and expertise needs of around 65,000 small & medium scale industries, concentrated in and around Ludhiana, Punjab. In the past, a major component of R&D carried out at this center has gone in towards the development of appropriate machinery for productivity enhancement in the agricultural and the post-harvest processing sectors. A series of oil expellers of different capacity (from 1TPD to 50TPD) are developed with a patented technology to produce pungent oil from mustard seed, which was released to a number of industries. In the Industrial front, the center developed many products ranging from single needle flat bed & post bed leather sewing machine and high speed safety stitching industrial sewing machine for the textile industry, brick moulding machine for the construction industry, radial drilling machine, friction welding machine, and <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> forklift <b>truck</b> for the manufacturing industry.|$|R

In 1951 M.D. Moody moved to 4652 Philips Highway and became incorporated as M. D. Moody & Sons, Inc. The company {{was one of}} the world’s largest crane dealers, both in units sold and in its rental fleet that included crawler cranes, <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> cranes, hydraulic <b>truck</b> cranes, derricks, and lattice boom cranes. The fleet ranged in sizes up to 450 ST. The firm has provided cranes for some of Florida’s biggest lifts and road and bridge construction across the southeast. M.D. Moody & Sons, Inc. was a Terex dealer for the southeast region of distribution as well as American Hoist & Derrick. Along with distributing heavy equipment there was also a parts department for a variety of cranes and heavy construction equipment. The parts department of M. D. Moody is currently owned by MOBRO Marine, Inc..|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{traversing}} a <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> by wheeled vehicles. Here <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> implies terrain which is geometrically not ideal. The criterion for mobility of a wheeled vehicle in any terrain is formally developed, providing insights into the mechanical structure requirements of the vehicle. A vehicle structure with an actively articulated suspension is found {{as a solution to}} improved <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> mobility. The contact forces of the vehicle with the surface being traversed are identified as the critical factor in determining the traversability of the surface. Hence a control strategy involving the control of the contact forces (normal and traction) is proposed. The key feature of the locomotion strategy, thus developed, is that it provides a solution involving dynamics of the main body for improving mobility in <b>rough</b> <b>terrain...</b>|$|R

40|$|Future {{planetary}} exploration missions {{will use}} rovers to perform tasks in <b>rough</b> <b>terrain.</b> Working in such conditions, a rover could become trapped due to loss of wheel traction, or even tip over. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory {{has developed a}} new rover {{with the ability to}} reconfigure its structure to improve tipover stability and ground traction. This paper presents a method to control this reconfigurability to enhance system tipover stability. A stability metric is defined and optimized online using a quasi-static model.

40|$|Abstract — <b>Rough</b> <b>terrain,</b> such as {{the rubble}} that {{we would expect to}} find in urban {{disaster}} areas, will likely impede robot mobility. The goal of this paper 1 is to find methods for quantifying the difficulty a robot should encounter traversing a region of <b>rough</b> <b>terrain.</b> We construct three metrics describing <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> robot mobility. In order to simplify the problem we assume that the <b>rough</b> <b>terrain</b> in question can be discretized in a certain manner and then we develop the metrics for this discretized version of the terrain. Two of these metrics reflect the difficulty a robot would have trying to move over the entire region of terrain, which is what we refer to as the coverability. The other metric describes the difficulty a robot would encounter attempting to move from some fixed point on the terrain to some other fixed point, which we call the crossability. We compute some coverability numbers for NIST step fields and briefly analyze the numerical data that are obtained...|$|R
