5|$|Mount Washington is {{a common}} objective, and is often climbed from Pinkham Notch. There are {{numerous}} trail approaches from the Appalachian Mountain Club's visitor's center. Although trail distances seem short, {{the trip to the}} summit should not be underestimated; most trail approaches involve at least 4,000 vertical feet (1,200m) of climbing, including an ascent of the rocky summit cone and the boulder-strewn upper slopes. Weather changes very quickly, and one must be prepared for extreme conditions. The Tuckerman <b>Ravine</b> Trail is the most popular trail in the notch, ascending to the summit via the headwall of Tuckerman <b>Ravine.</b> The Huntington <b>Ravine</b> Trail is widely considered the most difficult trail in New Hampshire, making its way up the precipitous headwall of neighboring Huntington <b>Ravine,</b> where there are several rock climbing opportunities.|$|E
5|$|The road forks to the {{northeast}} between large buildings and passes beneath Bloor Street, then crosses the Rosedale <b>Ravine.</b> It passes through residential South Rosedale, entering a trench and passing beneath Crescent Road. The road descends into the Yellow Creek <b>ravine</b> (crossing David A. Balfour Park) along the former route of Roxborough Drive, then climbs to pass beneath the Canadian Pacific Railway tracks. It continues to climb along the eastern bank of the <b>ravine,</b> entering Moore Park and turning north at St. Clair Avenue East. The road passes through the centre of Mount Pleasant Cemetery, after which it takes its name. It crosses the old Belt Line Railway trail, and winds northeast into Davisville Village.|$|E

50|$|Toby Run {{flows through}} {{a group of}} <b>ravines</b> for {{at least part of}} its distance. The <b>ravines</b> are known as the Toby Run <b>Ravines</b> and are located in Mahoning Township and Cooper Township. The <b>ravines</b> are {{relatively}} narrow. There is also a plateau in the watershed of the stream.|$|R
50|$|This {{region is}} {{identified}} by rest of India by its extensive <b>ravines.</b> The <b>ravines</b> created by gully erosion, are heavily under soil loss. The Government of Madhya Pradesh {{has tried to}} check this soil erosion and expansion of <b>ravines</b> by the means of watershed development and by aerial-seeding for plants like Prosopis, Acacia, and Jatropha in the <b>ravines.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{habitat of}} Novisuccinea chittenangoensis lies within the <b>ravine</b> {{at the base}} of the 167-foot-tall {{waterfall}} formed by Chittenango Creek as it flows north from its origin toward Oneida Lake. This north-south oriented <b>ravine</b> forms a deep gorge that is shaded or partially shaded throughout most of the growing season, resulting in a microclimate that stays relatively cool during the summer, and because of the creek flow and ice formations, is relatively warm in the winter compared to the surrounding area. Spring thaws and periodic major rainfall events tend to remove vegetation from significant portions of the primary Novisuccinea chittenangoensis habitat.|$|E
5|$|This {{bird with}} its somehow crow-like aspect gave {{foot to the}} naming of the Quebrada de los Cuervos (Crows <b>Ravine)</b> in Uruguay, where they dwell {{together}} with the black vulture and the turkey vulture.|$|E

50|$|Flatruet is a fell {{in north}} western Härjedalen, Sweden, between Mittådalen in Härjedalens kommun and Ljungdalen. Flatruet {{comprises}} many <b>ravines</b> {{dating back to}} the end of the ice age. The <b>ravines</b> were formed when the ice lake in the Messlingen valley area burst and rushed down into the valley below. The majority of the <b>ravines</b> reside on the south side of Flatruet.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} obstacle to construction is Toronto's network of <b>ravines.</b> Historically, city planners filled {{in many of}} the <b>ravines,</b> and when this was not possible, planners mostly ignored them, though today the remaining ones are embraced for their natural beauty. <b>Ravines</b> have helped isolate some central neighbourhoods {{from the rest of the}} city, and have contributed to the exclusivity of certain neighbourhoods such as Rosedale.|$|R
5|$|When {{widening}} in Scarborough {{reached the}} Highland Creek <b>ravine</b> in 1936, the Department of Highways began construction {{on a new}} bridge over the large valley, bypassing the former alignment around West Hill.|$|E
5|$|At daybreak on 8 August, six Japanese infiltrators {{hiding under}} {{the porch of}} the former British colonial {{headquarters}} shot and killed three Marines. Within five minutes, other Marines killed the six Japanese with grenades. Later that morning, the Marines, after landing reinforcements {{in the form of the}} 2nd Battalion, 2nd Marines (2/2), surrounded Hill 281 and the <b>ravine,</b> pounded both locations with mortar fire throughout the morning, and then assaulted the two positions, utilizing improvised explosive charges to kill the Japanese defenders taking cover in the many caves and fighting positions spread throughout the hill and <b>ravine.</b> Employing the improvised explosives, the individual Japanese fighting positions were destroyed. Significant Japanese resistance ended by the afternoon, although a few stragglers were found and killed over the next several days. In the battle for Tulagi, 307 Japanese and 45 U.S. troops died. Three Japanese soldiers were taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of town, the 55th Regiment {{received}} orders from Mawhood to fall back and join the 40th Regiment in town. The 40th had taken up a position just outside town, {{on the north side}} of a <b>ravine.</b> The 55th formed up to the left of the 40th. The 55th sent a platoon to flank the oncoming Americans, but it was cut to pieces. When Sullivan sent several regiments to scale the <b>ravine,</b> they fell back to a breastwork. After making a brief stand, the British fell back again, some leaving Princeton, and others taking up refuge in Nassau Hall. Alexander Hamilton brought three cannons up and had them blast away at the building. Then some Americans rushed the front door, broke it down, and the British put a white flag outside one of the windows. Exactly 194 British soldiers walked out of the building and laid down their arms.|$|E
50|$|Most of the <b>ravines</b> {{were long}} closed {{off from the}} city. The road network either {{bypassed}} the <b>ravines,</b> or crossed bridges running above them. Many people travelling through the city by private motor vehicle can thus be entirely unaware of the sharp variations in topography. It is only {{in recent years that}} a concerted effort has been made to integrate the <b>ravines</b> into a system of paths useful for pedestrians and cyclists. A number of the <b>ravines</b> now have paved paths, well maintained bridges, and stairs. Many others do not have such amenities, and the city intends to leave most of these areas unspoilt. The <b>ravines</b> are today popular with hikers and bicyclists, to the extent that erosion and wildlife disruption are becoming a problem in certain areas. While suitable for hiking and cycling, the rivers and creeks running through the <b>ravines</b> are still quite polluted and swimming and wading is inadvisable. There are many dangers for those exploring the <b>ravines.</b> Many areas are very rugged with poor paths and steep cliffs. There are few guardrails or stairs. Waterways are often fast moving and very cold, and can be deadly if one falls in. Poison ivy and nettles are also abundant.|$|R
50|$|The park lies on a glacial moraine, scribed {{with deep}} <b>ravines</b> running {{down to the}} St. Croix River. Sandstone {{outcrops}} have been exposed {{in some of the}} <b>ravines.</b> The vertical drop from the blufftop to the water is 300 ft.|$|R
5000|$|Certain {{parts of}} the <b>ravines</b> are also known as gay {{cruising}} areas. The <b>ravines</b> are also home to {{a considerable number of}} homeless people, some of them living in fairly elaborate temporary structures. In 2001, The Globe and Mail ran a three part series titled [...] "The Outsiders" [...] tracing the life of the homeless residents of the <b>ravines</b> over the course of nearly a year. It won a National Newspaper Award for best feature writing.|$|R
5|$|Between 1934 and 1936, after gaining {{approval}} from Lawrence Park developers, a bridge was constructed over the <b>ravine</b> and Mount Pleasant extended north to Lawrence Avenue. In 1935, Hilda Avenue was renamed, extending Mount Pleasant Road north to Forest Glen Crescent.|$|E
5|$|Colonel John Gibbon, whose men {{arrived at}} the battle on Tuesday, June 27, and also helped bury the dead, said he found Kellogg's body in a <b>ravine</b> where a number of men from Company E died. Kellogg's body was scalped and missing an ear; he was {{identified}} by the boots he wore.|$|E
5|$|Denbigh Park allows access {{into the}} Warwick River, a {{tributary}} of the James River. Denbigh Park also offers a small fishing pier.

5|$|Lee's army now dug {{in around}} Petersburg, Virginia {{and the long}} Siege of Petersburg {{commenced}} with several frontal assaults on the Confederate position. The 22nd {{took part in the}} assault on June 18, 1864. Again the regiment was deployed as skirmishers in front of their brigade. They were ordered to take a <b>ravine</b> alongside the Norfolk Railroad. Advancing at a run in the face of heavy canister fire, the 22nd reached the <b>ravine.</b> However, in that position they were subjected to severe musket and artillery fire from the Confederates, and so they pushed forward to the Norfolk Railroad cut, forcing the Confederates back to their entrenchments. In the assault on Petersburg, the 22nd lost seven killed and 14 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, {{laden with}} detail. Boars were (and are) much more {{difficult}} to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a <b>ravine.</b> He turns to face Bertilak {{with his back to the}} <b>ravine,</b> prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.|$|E
5|$|The {{mountain}} {{is part of}} a popular hiking area, with the Appalachian Trail crossing the summit and one of the Appalachian Mountain Club's eight mountain huts, the Lakes of the Clouds Hut, located on one of the mountain's shoulders. Winter recreation includes Tuckerman <b>Ravine,</b> famous for its Memorial Day skiing and its 45-degree slopes. The <b>ravine</b> is notorious for its avalanches, of which about 100 are recorded every year, and which have killed six people since 1849. Scores of hikers have died on the mountain in all seasons, due to harsh and rapidly changing conditions, inadequate equipment, and failure to plan for the wide variety of conditions which can occur above tree line.|$|E

5|$|Across {{the top of}} the <b>ravine</b> from Cave 1 on {{the other}} Stupa hill is a large hall known as Sitabai's temple cave. The portico has four pillars and two pilasters. The hall has 3 {{chambers}} at the back, the central one a shrine and the rest for monks or priests. The door of the central shrine has pilasters and a frieze, with the threshold decorated with lion figures. The sanctum has no image now, but is similar to Linga shrine on the island.|$|E
