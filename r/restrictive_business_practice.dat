40|$|Antitrust {{issues have}} {{become one of}} the main concern of the world economy {{community}} and the United Nations. For many years, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has multiplied the meetings to discuss the relationship between transnational enterprises and international investment and has engaged in reflections on methods to avoid a decline in international investment. However, these meetings failed to resolve the fundamental issue of the impact of international antitrust principles on restrictive arrangements between a foreign parent corporation and its local subsidiary, particularly where that subsidiary is in a developing country. If applied, multinational enterprises would be significantly deterred from creating and improving foreign subsidiaries because of rules denying them control of the buying and selling policies of such subsidiaries. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the market power of a multinational corporation in the relevant markets, the degree of independence of the subsidiary, the purpose of the restraint and the relationship between the scope and duration of the restraint and any legitimate purposes for it. This article explores two essential antitrust liability decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States aimed at enforcing the policy of American antitrust agencies in refraining them from challenging arrangements between closely affiliated firms, except in special circumstance. In addition, the author analyzed the basis of the Antitrust Guide for International Operations issued in 1977 by the Justice Department and its impact on the activities of a multinational corporation. The proposed approach set out in this paper calls for rules against restrictions on subsidiaries to deal only with basically commercial decisions, such as what the subsidiary should manufacture, where it should be located, and how it should be managed. Nevertheless, this article found that intra-corporate restrictions should be treated at the international level, not as never being a <b>restrictive</b> <b>business</b> <b>practice</b> or always being a <b>restrictive</b> <b>business</b> <b>practice,</b> but in terms of the rule-of-reason analysis developed in United States cases which analysis is closely approximated by the Common Market treatment of similar practices...|$|E

In 1964, Trelleborgs Gummifabriks AB was floated at the Stockholm Stock Exchange. The current name was adopted in 1977. Between 1983 and 1991, the strategy was to act as a wide-ranging industrial conglomerate, with a particular focus on mining and metals. Later, the company's focus returned to rubber products. In 1999, the scope was further narrowed by specializing in industrial applications. In 2003, polymer-based precision seals were added to the product offerings.

40|$|Policy {{regarding}} {{trade and}} {{foreign investment in}} oligopolistic industries is a difficult subject both in theory and in practice. Developed and developing countries often perceive that they have differing interests, but controversies and conflicts among the developed countries themselves often arise as governments create some sort of preference for national firms over foreign rivals (“strategic trade policy”). Multinational firms and their home-countries governments want “National Treatment ” for their firms abroad. Foreign firms should be treated the same as domestic firms, host-country governments should honor all pre-investment agreements, and should enforce contracts and property rights. Host countries and their national firms want “Competition Policy”, which protects them from <b>restrictive</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> of foreign multinationals and/or protects their market shares. In this project, I will draw on a familiar model {{to shed light on}} the question of whether or not restrictive policies or liberalizing policies (national treatment) benefit producers and consumers. Results indicate that there is the usual unilateral motive for protecting the domestic market from both imports and inward investment, and a strong motive to force open foreign markets for domestic firms [...] In general, a mutual exchange of market access improves the welfare of both countries, and in many cases improves firm profits along with consumer surplus...|$|R
40|$|Regulation 1 / 2003, {{applicable}} since 1 May 2004, {{has been}} one of the most far-reaching EU competition policy reforms in the history of European integration. The long-standing centralised administrative ex ante notification regime for commercial intercompany agreements was replaced by a decentralised ex post private enforcement regime. This essentially altered the way in which anticompetitive conduct, such as cartels and other <b>restrictive</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices,</b> are prosecuted. Companies can no longer rely on the official Commission decision prior to concluding contractual agreements with other companies, but are increasingly exposed to the risk of being litigated by other market actors in civil disputes, a jeopardy that, so far, has constituted a relatively alien feature in the EU. The 2004 reform reflects a major step of legal convergence towards the US antitrust regime, which has private enforcement as one of its most characteristic features. Regulation 1 / 2003, however, formed only the prelude of further reform proposals. Further reform steps appear on the horizon. The Green and White Paper of 2005 and 2008 aim at further institutionalising, and thus, consolidating a pan-European system of private enforcement.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the relationship of}} intellectual property rights and competition policies and rules addressing the conduct of private enterprise. Intellectual property rights {{are considered to be}} essential, but not sufficient, conditions for competition. Potentially excessive scope and use need to be balanced by way of competition rules. Such balance is partly inherent to the scope of IPRs and thus within the TRIPs Agreement. Partly, it will be achieved by applying competition rules. The proper balance, it is argued, does not necessarily require the establishment of comprehensive global disciplines on private party conduct and competition in the WTO. A number of reasons and conflicting interests are discussed. The paper argues that the balance can be adequately achieved by way of national or regional anti-trust rules, and efforts to bring about adequate legal regimes in particular in developing and transitional countries should be supported by national and international fora, including the WTO. There is no need at this stage, nor would the World be ready, for global anti-trust regimes and authorities. The paper, however, argues in favour of harmonisation of rules in two major areas: International legal assistance in the prosecution of <b>restrictive</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> and restrictions in WTO law on export cartels. Both areas would considerably enhance the prospects for a balance between IPRs and competition rules, and thus for market access in world trade law...|$|R
40|$|Résumé The {{presented}} work {{addresses the}} issue of the double-tracking nature of a dominant position in European competition law. The aim of the integration efforts during the establishment of the EU was the creation of an internal market, especially the customs union. In order to achieve this state, it was necessary to take a number of integration measures and create a legal framework, i. e. conditions, under which economic competition in the internal market could operate effectively. In this context a variety of legislation valid for the whole EU territory has been accepted. However, {{in the context of the}} economic competition this work analyzes the legislation on market dominance carried out first in Article 102 of TFEU (Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union) prohibiting <b>restrictive</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices</b> in the form of abuse of a dominant position and also in Council Regulation (EEC) No 4064 / 89 and later in Council Regulation (EC) No 139 / 2004 regulating the control of concentrations between undertakings. In case of both the legislations the crucial question is the "dominant position" of an enterprise in the market, while Article 102 of TFEU represents the ex post control, i. e. applies only to the possible abuse of the dominant position, and in this sense the dominant position itself is not the [...] ...|$|R

It has come {{as a result of the}} trade liberalization and regulatory reforms developed in each country since the early 1990 s. It has also been part of the “open regionalism ” approach adopted by the Andean Countries. Effective competition is expected to develop by exposing the highly concentrated and protected markets of the region to international competition. Competition policy plays three important roles in this process. First, it enhances market access for new competitors.

Second, although the existing laws and institutions have been built on the same foundation, each country has set different policy priorities that have notably influenced the enforcement outcomes.

40|$|There is the {{increasing}} importance of understanding the link between competition and trade policy and of exploring the gaps and problems that at present exist {{in the application of}} these policies. Trade and competition policies are closely related. Competition policy is aimed at ensuring the efficient functioning of markets by the removal or control of <b>restrictive</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices.</b> Trade liberalisation serves to sharpen competition in the domestic markets while barriers to trade which shelter particular domestic industries may have anti-competitive effects on national markets. It has become apparent how closely trade problems are linked with domestic industrial, regional or even macro-economic policies with which competition policy is also concerned. The {{purpose of this article is}} to examine both conditions of conflict and conditions of synergy between competition policy and the various instruments of trade policy. The article is organised in three parts. The first one discusses a range of trade policy measures, in particular non-tariff barriers from the perspective of competition policy. The second part is concerned with trade-related competition issues, i. e. those practices by enterprises or, as appropriate, by governments in their commercial activities which fall within the scope of competition policy and which have implications for international trade. The last part deals with the development of international competition policy and the pressure for and against it. It briefly examines the past efforts to reach international understandings on this issue and summarises some of the main existing laws and procedures.

The new world {{had just been}} opened up, overseas trade and plunder was pouring wealth through the international economy and attitudes among businessmen were shifting. In 1561 a system of Industrial Monopoly Licenses, similar to modern patents had been introduced into England. But by the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, the system was reputedly much abused and used merely to preserve privileges, encouraging nothing new {{in the way of}} innovation or manufacture. In response English courts developed case law on <b>restrictive</b> <b>business</b> <b>practices.</b> The statute followed the unanimous decision in Darcy v. Allein 1602, also known as the Case of Monopolies, of the King's bench to declare void the sole right that Queen Elizabeth I had granted to Darcy to import playing cards into England. [...] Darcy, an officer of the Queen's household, claimed damages for the defendant's infringement of this right. The court found the grant void and that three characteristics of monopoly were (1) price increases (2) quality decrease (3) the tendency to reduce artificers to idleness and beggary. This put an end to granted monopolies until King James I began to grant them again. In 1623 Parliament passed the Statute of Monopolies, which for the most part excluded patent rights from its prohibitions, as well as guilds. From King Charles I, through the civil war and to King Charles II, monopolies continued, especially useful for raising revenue. Then in 1684, in East India Company v. Sandys it was decided that exclusive rights to trade only outside the realm were legitimate, on the grounds that only large and powerful concerns could trade in the conditions prevailing overseas.|$|R
