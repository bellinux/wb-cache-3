50|$|Recent {{conservation}} efforts {{have seen an}} increase in the number of adult boas to around 1000. This has been achieved by eradicating goats and rabbits from the island and restoring natural habitat which has led to an increase of the boas’ natural prey, and it specializes in lizard hunting. In recent breeding efforts, <b>Round</b> <b>Island</b> <b>boas</b> in captivity have been fed by scenting small mice with chicken thigh meat.|$|E
50|$|The Boa and Python Specialist Group (BPSG) {{was founded}} in 2011 and {{comprises}} a global network of herpetologists, conservationists, government and non-government representatives, and researchers working to understand and conserve almost 190 species of boas, pythons, dwarf boas, shieldtails, Asian pipesnakes, American pipesnakes, dwarf pipesnakes, <b>Round</b> <b>Island</b> <b>boas,</b> Calabar burrowing python, Mexican burrowing python, sunbeam snakes, and spine-jawed snakes. The group produced a / Boa and Python Specialist Group brochure highlighting the species these families, their distribution, and the threats they face.|$|E

50|$|It reached about abbr=on 1 m in length, but {{preserved}} specimens {{have reported}} total lengths of 54-140 cm. Its colour {{was described as}} light brown with blackish spots dorsally and pink marbled with blackish ventrally. It had a pointed snout with a cylindrical body and head. Its general body form suggests that the <b>Round</b> <b>Island</b> burrowing <b>boa</b> had fossorial tendencies. This species' closest living relative is the <b>Round</b> <b>Island</b> <b>boa</b> (Casarea dussumieri).|$|R

50|$|The Trust {{began working}} in Mauritius during the 1970s. In 1998 it {{announced}} that the Mauritius kestrel - a species once reduced to only four birds - had been saved from extinction. Durrell is also working to save critically endangered species such as the pink pigeon, echo parakeet, <b>Round</b> <b>Island</b> <b>boa</b> (Casarea dussumieri) and Mauritius fody. It has also helped in the restoration of <b>Round</b> <b>Island</b> - a small island about 12 miles north east of Mauritius.|$|R

50|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{has been}} successful in the past. The Pere David's deer was successfully saved through captive breeding programs after almost being hunted to extinction in China. Captive-breeding is employed by modern conservationists, and has saved a wide variety of species from extinction, ranging from birds (e.g., the pink pigeon), mammals (e.g., the pygmy hog), reptiles (e.g., the <b>Round</b> <b>Island</b> <b>boa)</b> and amphibians (e.g., poison arrow frogs). Their efforts were successful in reintroducing the Arabian oryx (under the auspices of the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society), in 1963. The Przewalski's horse was also successfully reintroduced in the wild after being bred in captivity.|$|R
50|$|Captive {{breeding}} {{of other species}} has been successful. The Pere David's deer was successfully saved through captive breeding programs. After almost being hunted to extinction in China.

Their efforts were successful in reintroducing the Arabian oryx (under the auspices of the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society), in 1963. The Przewalski's horse has recently been re-introduced to the wild in Mongolia.In 2010, the Oregon Zoo found that Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit pairings based on familiarity and preferences resulted in a significant increase in breeding success.|$|R
50|$|The Trust’s {{headquarters}} {{is also a}} ‘window’ {{to the work of}} Durrell Wildlife around the world - where visitors can enjoy the opportunity {{to see some of the}} planet’s most endangered species and learn how the Trust is working to save them. What keeper-conservationists learn about a species while it is living in Jersey can help to save its cousins struggling for survival in the wild. Some species, such as gorillas and orangutans, are well known while other species, such as the Livingstone's fruit bat, the pied tamarin, the giant jumping rat, the Madagascar teal (Bernier's teal), the echo parakeet (Mauritius parakeet), the mountain chicken (actually a giant frog), and <b>Round</b> <b>Island</b> <b>boa,</b> are more obscure.|$|R
50|$|Many other {{endemic species}} of Mauritius became extinct after {{the arrival of}} man, so the {{ecosystem}} of the island is severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, forests covered Mauritius entirely, but very little remains today because of deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The Mauritius blue pigeon lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the broad-billed parrot, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck and the Mauritius night heron. Extinct Mauritian reptiles include the saddle-backed Mauritius giant tortoise, the domed Mauritius giant tortoise, the Mauritian giant skink and the <b>Round</b> <b>Island</b> burrowing <b>boa.</b> The small Mauritian flying fox and the snail Tropidophora carinata lived on Mauritius and Réunion but became extinct in both islands. Some plants, such as Casearia tinifolia and the palm orchid, have also become extinct.|$|R
50|$|The English {{traveller}} Sir Thomas Herbert described its behaviour towards red {{cloth in}} 1634: The hens in eating taste like parched pigs, {{if you see}} a flocke of twelve or twenties, shew them a red cloth, and with their utmost silly fury they will altogether flie upon it, and if you strike downe one, the rest are as good as caught, not budging an iot till they be all destroyed. Many other endemic species of Mauritius became extinct after the arrival of man heavily damaged the ecosystem, making it hard to reconstruct.

50|$|In 1953, the Japanese ornithologist Masauji Hachisuka {{suggested}} the broad-billed parrot was nocturnal, like the kakapo {{and the night}} parrot, two extant ground-dwelling parrots. Contemporary accounts do not corroborate this, and the orbits are of similar size {{to those of other}} large diurnal parrots. The broad-billed parrot was recorded on the dry leeward side of Mauritius, which was the most accessible for people, and it was noted that birds were more abundant near the coast, which may indicate that the fauna of such areas was more diverse. It may have nested in tree cavities or rocks, like the Cuban amazon. The terms raven or crow may have been suggested by the bird's harsh call, its behavioural traits, or just its dark plumage. The following description by Jacob Granaet from 1666 mentions some of the broad-billed parrot's co-inhabitants of the forests, and might indicate its demeanour: Within the forest dwell parrots, turtle and other wild doves, mischievous and unusually large ravens parrots, falcons, bats and other birds whose name I do not know, never having seen before. Many other endemic species of Mauritius were lost after the arrival of man, so the ecosystem of the island is severely damaged and hard to reconstruct. Before humans arrived, Mauritius was entirely covered in forests, almost all of which have since been lost to deforestation. The surviving endemic fauna is still seriously threatened. The broad-billed parrot lived alongside other recently extinct Mauritian birds such as the dodo, the red rail, the Mascarene grey parakeet, the Mauritius blue pigeon, the Mauritius owl, the Mascarene coot, the Mauritian shelduck, the Mauritian duck, and the Mauritius night heron.
