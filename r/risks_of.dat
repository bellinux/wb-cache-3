Risk measurement is performed using fuzzy FMEA method then the risk priority level is obtained. The supply chain structure of organic rice product consist of farmers as suppliers, MUTOS as manufacturer, PT Herbal Estate, PPLH Surabaya, Kaliandra, and CV Mandalabimasakti SM as distributors, and Ranch Market Galaxy Mall as retailer and consumer. The distribution network of organic rice product is retail storage with customer pickup network. The priority risk order in this supply chain based on research from the highest risk to the lowest <b>risk</b> are <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> product return, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> damage or loss quality, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> product contamination during process, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> lack <b>of</b> stock, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> competitor existence, quality incompability <b>risk,</b> <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> contain chemical contaminants, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> supply delays, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> processing delays, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> damage during process, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> machine damage during process, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> demand changing, <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> damaged during storage, and <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> production decreased...|$|R

40|$|Target of {{the work}} is to study the Latvian trade sector {{external}} and internal risks, perform risk identification, classification and assessment. In the work are used scientific research methods – analysis and synthesis methods, economic analysis method of enterprises, the special coefficient method and the risk ranking method. The authors had studied the Latvian trade sector in the period from 2004 to 2010. In Latvian trade sector from 2004 to 2006 was observed increment of turnover, but from 2007 was observed decline of turnover. In Latvian trade sector is monopolistic competition. Many enterprises offer a market differentiated trade services. Small and medium companies are merging into trade cooperation and chain stores. The authors had studied average financial indexes of the Latvian trade sector enterprises. Average financial <b>risk</b> coefficient <b>of</b> Latvian trade sector enterprises had increased during the period from 2006 to 2009. The authors have created classification of Latvian trade sector economic and financial <b>risks</b> and classification <b>of</b> the trade technological process risks. The authors have created the algorithms of classification and assessment of the trade sector enterprises’ risks. The economic risks are the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> the country’s economic slowdown, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> increment <b>of</b> taxes, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> reduction in consumer’s solvency, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> demand’s instability and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> insufficiency of credit resources. The financial risks are the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> unpaid credit, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> financial instability, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> insufficiency of own capital, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> liquidity and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> debtors. The trade technological process risks are the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> organization of selling goods, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> accounting, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> ordering goods, the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> acceptance of goods and the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> transportation of goods. In order to develop their business strategies, enterprises need to identify, classify and assess the Latvian trade sector risks. Enterprises can use the authors created algorithms of classification and assessment <b>of</b> the <b>risks</b> to produce their own risk management systems...|$|R

40|$|In general, poverty {{measures}} are estimated by applying income information. However, only using income data for calculating relative poverty {{might lead to}} an incomplete view. For example, a household can be under a poverty threshold even if a household member owns real estate or equity. In this thesis, at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income poverty in Germany is estimated. In {{order to get a}} more complete picture <b>of</b> at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> poverty, a multidimensional approach is applied. Not only at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income poverty, also at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> wealth poverty is measured. Moreover, households that are both at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income and wealth poor are analyzed. Furthermore, several poverty groups are identified: twice-poor which are households that are, at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income and wealth poverty; protected-poor, households that are at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income poverty but not at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> wealth poverty; vulnerable-poor, households which are at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> wealth poverty but not at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income poverty; non-poor, households which are either at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> income poverty nor at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> wealth poverty. Poverty profiles in Germany and their changes over time are analyzed for the years 2002, 2007 and 2012. In fact, it is investigated to which degree at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> poverty rates differ in socio-economic characteristics. A logit regression is applied for each dimension and each wave for estimation. For robustness checks, 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals are calculated for all results. Findings suggest that young age, region East Germany, single, lone parent, unemployment and low education are factors that condition the at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> poverty rates. The definition of a certain rate influences the percentage of households that are affected by at <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> poverty, however, has a limited effect on poverty profiles. Poverty profiles have not changed over time but some factors such as unemployment and low education have significantly increased...|$|R

5|$|The {{ability to}} {{determine}} if and when to become pregnant, is vital to a woman's autonomy and well being, and contraception can protect girls and young women from the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> early pregnancy and older women from the increased <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> unintended pregnancy. Adequate access to contraception can limit multiple pregnancies, {{reduce the need for}} potentially unsafe abortion and reduce maternal and infant mortality and morbidity. Some barrier forms of contraception such as condoms, also reduce the risk of STIs and HIV infection. Access to contraception allows women to make informed choices about their reproductive and sexual health, increases empowerment, and enhances choices in education, careers and participation in public life. At the societal level, access to contraception is a key factor in controlling population growth, with resultant impact on the economy, the environment and regional development. Consequently, the United Nations considers access to contraception a human right that is central to gender equality and women's empowerment that saves lives and reduces poverty, and birth control has been considered amongst the 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century.|$|E
