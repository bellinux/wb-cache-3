30|$|The {{transport}} {{rules of}} CIM and SMGS help to better organise transport processes in international {{rail freight transport}} and they harmonise conditions for quick, quality and safe international rail freight transport. Establishing {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of the transport rules of CIM and SMGS is a complicated process which is affected by several factors. For example, Belarus, the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan have common customs areas and for these countries and their railway companies SMGS transport rules are preferable. In the Slovak Republic it is more convenient to use CIM transport rules based on the membership in the EU. One of great advantages of CIM rules is that the <b>consignment</b> <b>note</b> can be used as a customs paper in rail transport. When a carrier uses CIM <b>consignment</b> <b>note</b> for import or export to/from the EU there is no need to make an additional customs document. With the SMGS <b>consignment</b> <b>note</b> this option does not exist and the carrier (or shipper) must create a transit declaration based on the Union Customs Code ([URL] [22].|$|R

30|$|The International Committee of the Railway and the Organisation for Cooperation of Railways {{is working}} on the {{implementation}} of legal frameworks to enable simpler, more acceptable and faster transport of goods by rail. A unique CIM/SMGS <b>consignment</b> <b>note</b> is to be created. For example, transport through the Slovak Railways is to be regulated by the rules of the CIM until the border station, where the rules concerning SMGS for the further transport path in Ukraine will be applied, and vice versa. Benefits of a CIM/SMGS <b>consignment</b> <b>note</b> include the following: both the contracts of carriage can be displayed on a single sheet of paper that can be issued in an electronic form, with greater legal certainty for all participants in the process of transportation, reduced transportation costs, reduced transport time, improved quality of transport, and greater competitiveness of railways in international freight.|$|R
30|$|Organisation of {{the rail}} {{transport}} of goods between Slovakia and Ukraine is a demanding and time-consuming process requiring the cooperation and coordination of all services to observe legal, technological, organisational and technical regulations. Establishing a common CIM/SMGS <b>consignment</b> <b>note</b> is a key goal {{in the implementation of}} fast, efficient and safe transportation of goods between the European Union and Ukraine. The introduction of a common CIM/SMGS <b>consignment</b> <b>note</b> will contribute to a greater legal certainty for all participants in the process of transportation of cargo in international traffic. Moreover the time of freight transport will be reduced, thus contributing to a reduction in transport costs and an improved quality of transport. Failings in electronic data processing of CIM and SMGS <b>consignment</b> <b>notes</b> greatly extend the processing time of transport documentation, leading to increased transportation costs. In the interests of offering customers a simpler method for organising transport between member states signatories to the CIM and SMGS, contract work to improve existing rules and introduction of new technical and technological innovations are needed. It is necessary to introduce an electronic information system that will enable the electronic processing of transport documents or electronic CIM/SMGS <b>consignment</b> <b>notes.</b> The system must be compatible with the system of the countries participating in the implementation of rail freight transport between Slovakia and Ukraine so as to accelerate the process of checking and issuing the documentation required when goods move from Ukraine to Slovakia, and vice versa. Electronic processing of transport documentation offers a flexible and efficient service with the information available in real time among all participants involved in the process of transporting goods by rail. The introduction of electronic processing of transport documents reduces the technological processing time for handling the wagons, speeds up the transport process and increases the efficiency of employees. According to the case study, if electronic waybills were to be applied, this would equate to a saving of 170  min or 66.7  % of the total time spent at border stations.|$|R

The services should be executed on a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), related to the work done by the drivers when they are outside of the truck. A lot of theories have been used as a base for our study. All work has been carried out in correspondence with methods for the following areas; literature studies, field studies, analysis of problem areas, and design, implementation, and test of a software prototype on a PDA. When all literature studies, own conducted field studies, and some part of the analysis phase were completed, we had come up with a large number of ideas. All ideas were further analysed and of them were five services selected. These services are named: Load Indicator, <b>Consignment</b> <b>Note,</b> Drivers Manual, Friend Finder, Keyless entry and Alarm. Load Indicator is a service that helps the driver to keep track that the maximum cargo weight for the truck is not exceeded.

30|$|In {{this part}} we {{concentrate}} on research {{that focuses on}} organisational and technological procedures in international railway transport. Evtimov [9] suggested {{that there should be}} interoperability between CIM and SMGS procedures, and identified three phases: (1) a common CIM/SMGS <b>consignment</b> <b>note,</b> (2) a unique claim handling mechanism, and (3) a single Eurasian rail transport law. Zitrický [23] investigated the rationalisation of technological processes in international railway freight transport using network optimising methods such as the program evaluation and review technique (PERT) and the critical path method (CPM). His main focus was on how to reduce the time spent by technological processes. Abramović [1] examined the use of demand forecasting models in international freight transport. Through these models he established not only the influence of the traffic sector but also the key drivers of the economy. Zitrický and Blaho [24] suggested technical and technological parameters for use with the common <b>consignment</b> <b>note</b> CIM/SMGS. In research Drożdziel et al. [7] make a proposal of solving the problems within the East – West transport by building a new broad gauge infrastructure, but they did not make any analyses for organisational optimisation in transport between the East and West. In our research we have used following resources about network techniques modelling: Pašagić [16] and Tulsian and Pandey [21]. Both resources take a strict mathematical approach for explaining network techniques. But Pašagić [16] has also introduced some possible uses of network techniques in transport.|$|R

CMR Konvencije iz 1956. g., koja bi omogućila funkcionalnu jednakost transportnog dokumenta neovisno o načinu njegova izdavanja (papirnati ili elektronički). Upravo to je postignuto donošenjem EDI-CMR Protokola 2008. godine, koji je stupio na snagu 2011. godine i danas obvezuje 9 država. U radu se daje geneza nastanka teksta EDI-CMR Protokola 2008., te se diskutira o njegovim rješenjima i potrebi da Hrvatska ratifi cira ovaj novi i moderni {{instrument}} međunarodnog cestovnog prava.

Compared to 55 states {{parties to the}} original document, the CMR Convention of 1956, this is certainly a modest number. The reason for such reluctance in accepting this new and modern international instrument is certainly {{not to be found}} in its content. The EDI-CMR Protocol of 2008 relies on two major principles: technological neutrality that ascertains that legal rules apply equally, notwithstanding the technology used; and functional equality, whereby transport documents issued on paper and in the electronic mode have the same legal treatment. The EDI-CMR Protocol of 2008 does not impose any obligation with respect to the use of electronic <b>consignment</b> <b>note.</b> Quite to the contrary, it only gives the basic legal framework for the use of such a document, in case parties to the contract of carriage wish to use such technology, avoiding therefore the possibilities of divergent legal regimes and solutions in diff erent countries. The basic practical prerequisite {{for the use of the}} electronic <b>consignment</b> <b>note</b> is the same technological platform used by the parties to the contract of carriage of goods, which is basically reserved for large companies with steady business relationship. Countries ratifying the EDI-CMR Protocol of 2008 will, therefore, not impose any new obligation on their road freight carriers; they will only give a new incentive and legal certainty to the best among them that are able to compete more safely on a new level of e-commerce and e-transport either within the single market, or internationally. It is hence largely advisable for Croatia to ratify this new and modern instrument in the fi eld of international road transport law...|$|R

Through the 1950s Avondale had monitored its sheep flocks as part of the research into Dwalganup strain of clover as a livestock feed and its effect on ewe fertility. On into the 1960s and 1970s Avondale was involved with the breeding and trial of various cereal crops for use within Western Australia. Since the early 1980s Avondale has focused on environmental and sustainable farming along with farm income supplemental alternatives like marron farming.Avondale like most Western Australian farms utilised horses and Clydesdales in particular for pulling farming equipment. Farm economics of the 1930s meant that the Clydesdales weren't retired to enjoy the governments grassy paddocks.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 23 rd Annual Southern African Transport Conference 12 - 15 July 2004 "Getting recognition {{for the importance of}} transport", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Road transportation is, in most European countries, governed by the "CMR" Convention. The acronym CMR is short for the French title of the Convention: Convention relative au transport de Marchandises par Route (Convention relating to the carriage of Goods by Road). This Convention, which was opened for signature on May 19, 1956, has been adopted by more than 40 countries. This broad success of the Convention, coupled with the practical experience of almost 50 years of case law, applying the provisions of the Convention to actual transport problems, makes the CMR-Convention into an example well worth looking into for any State wishing to develop a legal regime for carriage of goods by road. Moreover, the CMR is generally considered a good Convention. It provides the parties involved in road carriage with a uniform set of rules, determining their rights, duties and liabilities. It is also a balanced Convention, taking into account and seeking a compromise between the interests of both the cargo and the carriers. The CMR-Convention describes the rights and duties of the parties, among others with regard to making out the <b>consignment</b> <b>note,</b> packing the goods for transport, checking the goods {{at the beginning of the}} carriage, changing the instructions of the carrier and disposing of the goods, performing the carriage within a reasonable time, and sending dangerous goods. Furthermore, the Convention sets up a liability regime, with on the one hand a presumption of liability against the carrier, but on the other hand a number of specific, transport-related defenses and a limitation of liability, that can only be broken in exceptional circumstances. The CMR-Convention also deals with certain aspects of claims and procedures between the parties; it provides an exhaustive list of courts that have jurisdiction over road carriage claims, and determines the applicable time bar. By making the carrier's liability predictable, the Convention has also made this liability readily insurable. This paper was transferred from the original CD ROM created for this conference.
