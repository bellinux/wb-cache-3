40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to design a music therapy physiological measures test (MTPMT) and to implement ini tial standardization procedures by administering the MTPMT to a sample of vocational rehabilitation clients. This evalua tion, developed with the assistance of a physical therapy consultant, involves measurement of motions required for performance on four musical instruments: piano, organ, classical guitar, and trap drum set. The MTPMT was admin istered individually to 30 subjects, with two separate admin istrations conducted at i-week intervals. The physical ther apy consultant administered a comparable physical therapy evaluation containing the same items of motion as the MTPMT. When data from the MTPMT were compared to data from the physical therapy evaluation. a significant va lidity coefficient was obtained (r =. 95, df =. 28, p <. 01). When test-retest data from the MTPMT were compared, a significant reliability coefficient was obtained (r =. 96, df = 28, p <. 01). These results indicate that the MTPMT is a reliable, valid, easily administered method for <b>recording</b> <b>gross</b> and fine movements used in instrumental performance. This test may be helpful to music therapists who use musical instruments to facilitate physical rehabilitation within a vari ety of settings...|$|E
40|$|Lombard (1) in 1911 {{showed that}} bv {{illuminating}} the skin the capillaries {{could be seen}} under the microscope. Since then many observations {{have been carried out}} on the changes which take place in these vessels in health and disease. The early observations which were made recorded the impressions of the author but had no quantitative basis. In recent years photographic records have been made by some investigators in order to study the changes which take pJace in human capillaries. This method is suitable for <b>recording</b> <b>gross</b> changes which last for a considerable length of time, such as comparing the form of the capillaries in different diseased conditions. Many changes which take place in the capillary circulation are however rapid and so fleeting that it seemed desirable, if they were to be placed on a quantitative basis, to obtain records at a more rapid rate than one could do by ordinary photography. It seemed possible that cinematographic records would enable one to follow these changes and subsequently analyse them in detail by measurement. The possibility of studying alterations in the capillaries by means of cinematography first suggested itself to Krogh and Rehberg (2). They developed a method of taking photographs of the circulation in the capillaries in the tissues of Rana temporaria. It is naturally simpler to obtain records from the tissues of frogs than from human tissues since for this purpose a technique resembling that used in histological photomicrography suffices. In the human case, however, transmitted light cannot be used, so Lombard's method of illumination from above has been universally adopted. This method is difficult because by it contrast and intensity of light are much reduced com...|$|E
40|$|Electrocardiographic (ECG) {{changes have}} never been {{reported}} in canine babesiosis. Based on the metabolic, electrolyte, and myocardial alterations described for the disease, such changes are to be expected. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe ECG changes in canine babesiosis, and to correlate those changes to clinical severity, outcome and cardiac histopathological changes. Four groups of dogs with babesiosis were studied: mild to moderate anaemia (n= 40), severe anaemia (n= 35), concurrent immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (n= 18) and complicated (n= 28). Lead II ECG was recorded at admission for 1 minute in all dogs, and repeated after 24 hours in admitted dogs (groups II – IV). Six lead ECG was recorded in 88 dogs. Full necropsy was performed between 30 - 60 minutes after death on 16 dogs (5 died on arrival, 11 had ECG <b>recording).</b> <b>Gross</b> cardiac pathology was recorded and histopathology of myocardial sections from ventricles, atria, apex and interventricular septa was evaluated, using a scoring system for haemorrhages, necrosis, inflammatory infiltrate and fibrin microthrombi. The following ECG changes were recorded: sinoatrial (7 %) and atrioventricular blocks (4 %), ventricular premature complexes (7 %), low R-amplitude (23 %), prominent Q (33 %), axis deviations (40 %), prolonged QRS (32 %), ST depression and coving (28 %), large T (42 %), and notched R (28 %). Differences between groups were minor and inconsistent. Gross pathological changes were pericardial effusion (25 %) and subepicardial (56 %) and subendocardial haemorrhages (63 %). Histological changes were haemorrhages (69 %), necrosis (50 %), inflammation (63 %) and fibrin microthrombi (75 %). The only correlation between pathology and ECG was low R-amplitude and pericardial effusion. There was a significantly higher prevalence of sinus bradycardia and irregular sinus rhythm in the non-survivors. Both ECG and pathological changes were non-specific, but there were similarities to the pattern of changes that have been described for myocarditis and myocardial ischaemia. Antiarrhythmic treatment was only required in 1 dog. Thus, the clinical application of the ECG changes found in this study was limited. It was concluded that the heart suffers from the same pathological processes described in other organs in canine babesiosis, namely inflammation and hypoxia. Cardiovascular management, if necessary, should be based on functional monitoring rather than ECG. Dissertation (MMedVet (Med)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.
