50|$|<b>Remogliflozin</b> <b>etabonate</b> (RE) {{was shown}} to enhance urinary glucose {{excretion}} in rodents and humans. Early studies in diabetics improved plasma glucose levels. <b>Remogliflozin</b> <b>etabonate</b> has been studied at doses up to 1000 mg. A pair of 12-week phase 2b randomized clinical trials of diabetics published in 2015, found reductions in glycated hemoglobin {{and that it was}} generally well tolerated.|$|E

50|$|<b>Remogliflozin</b> <b>etabonate</b> is a pro-drug of remogliflozin. Remogliflozin {{inhibits}} the sodium-glucose transport proteins (SGLT), {{which are}} responsible for glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Blocking this transporter causes blood glucose to be eliminated through the urine. Remogliflozin is selective for SGLT2.|$|E
40|$|The low-affinity sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT 2) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in renal glucose reabsorption and is a remark-able transporter as a molecular target for the treatment of diabetes. We have discovered <b>remogliflozin</b> <b>etabonate,</b> which is a novel category of selective SGLT 2 inhibitors. <b>Remogliflozin</b> <b>etabonate</b> is a prodrug based on benzylpyrazole glucoside and is metabolized to its active form, remogliflozin, in the body. We identified remogliflozin to be a potent and highly selective SGLT 2 inhibitor by examining COS- 7 cells transiently express-ing either high-affinity sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT 1) or SGLT 2. Orally administered <b>remogliflozin</b> <b>etabonate</b> increased urinary glucose excretion in a dose-dependent manner in both mice and rats. By increasing urinary glucose excretion, remo-gliflozin etabonate inhibited the increase in plasma glucos...|$|E
40|$|Inhibitors of sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT 2) {{increase}} glucose excretion in {{the urine}} and improve blood glucose in Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Glycosuria provides an energy and osmotic drain that could alter body composition. We therefore conducted a pilot study comparing the effects on body composition of two SGLT 2 inhibitors, <b>remogliflozin</b> <b>etabonate</b> (RE) 250  mg TID (n =  9) and sergliflozin etabonate (SE) (1000  mg TID) (n =  9), with placebo (n =  12) in obese non-diabetic subjects. Both drugs were well tolerated during 8 weeks of dosing, and the most common adverse event was headache. No urinary tract infections were observed, {{but there was one}} case of vaginal candidiasis in the RE group. As expected, RE and SE increased urine glucose excretion, with no change in the placebo group. All the subjects lost weight over 8 weeks, irrespective of treatment assignment. There was a reduction in TBW measured by D 2 O dilution in the RE group that was significantly greater than placebo (1. 4  kg, p =  0. 029). This was corroborated by calculation of fat-free mass using a quantitative magnetic resonance technique. All but one subject had a measurable decrease in fat mass. There was significant between-subject variability of weight and fat loss, and no statistically significant differences were observed between groups. Despite a lack of a difference in weight and fat mass loss, the leptin/adiponectin ratio, a measure of insulin resistance, was significantly decreased in the RE group when compared to placebo and SE, suggesting that this SGTL- 2 inhibitor may improve metabolic health independent of a change in fat mass...|$|E
