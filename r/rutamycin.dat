50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, ATP10 protein (mitochondrial ATPase complex subunit ATP10) is an ATP synthase assembly factor. It {{is essential}} for the assembly of the mitochondrial F1-F0 complex. A yeast nuclear gene (ATP10) encodes a product that {{is essential for}} the assembly of a functional mitochondrial ATPase complex. Mutations in ATP10 induce a loss of <b>rutamycin</b> sensitivity in the mitochondrial ATPase, but do not affect the respiratory enzymes. ATP10 has a molecular weight of 30,293 Da and its primary structure is not related to any known subunit of the yeast or mammalian mitochondrial ATPase complexes. ATP10 is associated with the mitochondrial membrane. It is suggested that the ATP10 product is not a subunit of the ATPase complex but rather a protein required for the assembly of the F0 sector of the complex.|$|E
40|$|Mouse {{fibroblasts}} {{resistant to}} the drug <b>rutamycin</b> were isolated by selectively introducing BrdUrd into the mitochondrial genome {{of a line of}} mouse fibroblasts (clone 1 D) lacking a cytoplasmic thymidine kinase enzyme. The ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase; EC 3. 6. 1. 3) activity of mitochondria isolated from these cells was resistant to <b>rutamycin.</b> The rutamycin-resistant mutants were enucleated with cytochalasin B and fused with mouse A 9 cells resistant to 8 -azaguanine and sensitive to <b>rutamycin.</b> Cytoplasmic hybrids, or cybrids, were selected as cells resistant to <b>rutamycin</b> and 8 -azaguanine, and appeared at a high frequency. Other fusions between rutamycin-resistant nucleated cells and A 9 produced colonies at a much lower frequency. Finally, fusions between enucleated clone 1 D cells and A 9 cells produced no rutamycin-resistant colonies. These results indicate that <b>rutamycin</b> resistance is a cytoplasmically inherited characteristic in this cell line...|$|E
40|$|Resistance to {{the drug}} <b>rutamycin,</b> an {{inhibitor}} of mitochondrial ATPase, {{has been shown to}} be cytoplasmically inherited in a mouse fibroblast line (TL) on fusion of the cytoplast (enTL) with a nucleated recipient A 9 [Lichtor & Getz (1978) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 75, 324 - 328]. The cytoplasmic hybrid (cybrid) so formed may be readily grown in the presence [CY(+) ] or absence [CY(-) ] of <b>rutamycin.</b> The ATPase of TL mitochondria is similarly resistant to <b>rutamycin</b> whether grown in the presence or absence of antibiotic. The ATPase of CY(+) mitochondria is resistant to <b>rutamycin,</b> but CY(-) mitochondrial ATPase is sensitive to <b>rutamycin.</b> Nevertheless, CY(-) can be readily grown in <b>rutamycin</b> after a brief lag. The pH optima of mitochondrial ATPase are 8. 0 for A 9 and CY(-) cells and 7. 5 for TL cells, whereas the pH optimum for CY(+) spans the optima of A 9 and TL. The TL mitochondrial NADH-cytochrome c reductase is resistant to rotenone, whereas that of A 9 mitochondria is sensitive to this agent. CY(-) and CY(+) mitochondria are sensitive and resistant respectively to rotenone. Growth of cybrids in <b>rutamycin</b> for 2 weeks results in a 2 - 3 -fold increase in mitochondrial mass, measured on the basis of electron microscopic morphometry, mitochondrial membrane enzyme assays, mass of cardiolipin, and quantification of mitochondrial DNA. These data suggest that the cybrid harbours two populations of mitochondria and that the proportions of the two populations dramatically influence morphology, growth and mitochondrial phenotype in the cybrid. Selective pressure appears to induce these changes through the differential amplification of mitochondria...|$|E
40|$|A low-molecular-weight protein {{synthesized}} in yeast mitochondria was purified. The protein {{was identified}} as a component of the rutamycin-sensitive ATPase. The amino-acid composition of the purified protein shows an extremely large preponderance of nonpolar residues, which may account for its solubility in chloroform-methanol. Indirect evidence suggests that this component is involved in the conferral of <b>rutamycin</b> sensitivity and may also have a function in the assembly of the ATPase complex...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} oligomycin {{resistant}} mutants has been isolated following u. v. irradiation. The phenotypic and genotypic properties of these mutants, which show {{high levels of}} resistance to oligomycin and <b>rutamycin,</b> have been investigated and, {{on the basis of}} these results, it has been possible to divide the mutants into two main classes, class I and class II. Class I Mutants of this class show low levels of cross resistance (increases of two-to-four-fold) to various uncouplers such as TTFB, 1799 and chloro CCP, to inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation like aurovertin and triethyltin, to the inhibitor of electron transport, antimycin A, and protein synthesis inhibitors such as cycloheximide, mikamycin, chloramphenicol and erythromycin. The mutants are apparently, however, resistant to neither DNP nor octylDNP. In a high percentage of the mutants, exposure to low temperatures (20 ºC) resulted in the loss of the primary resistance to oligomycin and <b>rutamycin,</b> though the secondary cross resistances were apparently unaffected. No effect of either high or low temperatures on either the fermentable or non-fermentable growth of these mutants were apparent. No alteration in the growth rate of the majority of the strains or in their appearance on electron microscopic examination was detected, though their growth yield is 15 – 20...|$|E
40|$|Promitochondria of anaerobically grown Saccharomyces cerevisiae lack cytochromes aa 3, b, c 1, and c, {{as well as}} ubiquinone, yet {{catalyze}} a Pi-ATP exchange {{reaction that}} is sensitive to uncouplers, <b>rutamycin,</b> and atractyloside. The promitochondrial Pi-ATP exchange reaction is abolished by the cytoplasmic “petite” mutation, {{as well as by}} growth of the cells in the presence of erythromycin, which indicates a role of mitochondrial protein synthesis in the assembly of the energy transfer system. These observations demonstrate that mitochondrial energy transfer can occur {{in the absence of a}} respiratory chain...|$|E
40|$|When {{an enzyme}} {{exhibits}} a high affinity for an inhibitor, the steady-state {{analysis of the}} mechanism {{is complicated by the}} non-linearity of normal dose–response plots or of reciprocal replots. It is shown here that dose–response measurements generate a linear plot of inhibitor concentration divided by degree of inhibition against velocity without inhibitor divided by velocity with inhibitor; the concentration of enzyme may be derived from the extrapolated intercept of such plots, and the mechanism of inhibition from replots of the variation of the slope with substrate concentration. The limiting cases where virtually all inhibitor molecules are bound or virtually all are free are described, together with the situation when a significant proportion of the substrate becomes bound. This type of analysis indicates that the inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation, <b>rutamycin</b> and bongkrekic acid, are tightly bound to rat liver mitochondria...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{accumulation}} of Ca ++ by microsomal (sarcotubular) preparations of rabbit skeletal muscle {{in the presence}} of oxalate, and the concurrent splitting of nucleoside triphosphate, displayed moderate nucleotide specificity in the sequence ATP> GTP, CTP, ITP> UTP> (ADP) > ATetraP for the former, ATP> (ADP) > ITP> GTP> CTP> UTP> ATetraP for the latter process. The "calcium pump " was weakly inhibited by caffeine, and was inhibited together with the ATPase by pyridoxalphosphate. Carnosine had no effect as such nor {{in the presence of}} pyridoxalphosphate except at high concentration; thiourea and p-chloromercuribenzoate were inhibiting while iodoacetate was inactive. Ca + accumulation and ATPase were inhibited by atabrine (not tested on ATPase), dinitrophenol, and amytal. High concentrations of oligomycin and <b>rutamycin</b> inhibited Ca++ uptake while slightly stimulating ATPase. Antimycin A stimulated the Ca++ uptake. These results are discussed in the light of their possible relation to partial reactions in oxidative phosphorylation. The Ca++ uptake and relaxing factor activities did not behave identically throughout. This is in part ascribed to changes in reactivity of actomyosin in the relaxation test, in part to the participation of relaxing substances other than the calcium pump...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{respiratory}} deficient nuclear mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, N 9 - 168, {{assigned to}} complementation group G 95 was previously shown to lack subunit 9, {{one of the}} three mitochondrially encoded subunits of the F 0 component of the mitochondrial ATPase. As a consequence of the structural defect in F 0, the ATPase activity of G 95 mutants is not inhibited by <b>rutamycin.</b> The absence of subunit 9 in N 9 - 168 has been correlated with a lower steady-state level of its mRNA and an increase in higher molecular weight precursor transcripts. These results suggest that the mutation is most likely to affect either translation of the ??? mRNA or processing or the primary transcript. We have isolated a nuclear gene, designated ATP 13, which complements the respiratory defect and restores rutamycin-sensitive ATPase in G 95 mutants. Disruption of ATP 13 induces a respiratory deficiency which is not complemented by G 95 mutants. The nucleotide sequence of ATP 13 indicates a primary translation product with an M??? of 42 897. The protein has a basic amino terminal signal sequence that is cleaved upon import into mitochondria. No significant primary structure homology is detected with any protein in the most recent libraries...|$|E
40|$|A meiotic {{segregant}} (oliPR 1) {{was isolated}} with a phenotype of multiple cross resistance and collateral sensitivity. Strain oliPR 1 has increased sensitivity to ethidium bromide, dequalinium chloride, acriflavin, paromomycin and neomycin, and increased resistance to oligomycin, <b>rutamycin,</b> venturicidin, triethyltin bromide, antimycin, carbonylcynamide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, tetra-N-butylammonium bromide, dibenzyldimethylammonium chloride, triphenylmethylphosphonium bromide, chloramphenicol, carbomycin, tetracycline, triton-X- 165 and cycloheximide. Single gene inheritance {{of the cross}} resistance and collateral sensitivity was shown by 2 : 2 parental ditype segregation and reversion of the complete phenotype by a spontaneous revertant. The locus conferring the oliPR 1 phenotype was mapped 11. 7 units from an unspecified centromere. Antibiotic resistance showed incomplete dominance, {{with the level of}} hybrid resistance dependent upon the inhibitor tested. Resistant diploids that produced four resistant ascospores were the result of mitotic recombination prior to meiosis. A partial revertant phenotype (sensitive to all inhibitors except oligomycin, antimycin and carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone) was shown to be due to a single nuclear gene causing partial suppression of oliPR 1. Anaerobic pretreatment, 37 ° and 0. 5 M KCl were observed to reduce the growth of oliPR 1 when challenged with seven diverse inhibitors (antimycin, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone,-chloramphenicol, cycloheximide, oligomycin, triethyltin bromide, and triphenylmethylphosphonium bromide). Resistance to cycloheximide was not altered by the [rho—] state. A revertant of oliPR 1 (sensitive to the above inhibitors but resistant to ethidium bromide, paromycin and neomycin) showed anaerobic and temperature sensitization to ethidium bromide, paromomycin and neomycin. Continuous monitoring of oxygen uptake by the revertant after anaerobic pretreatment revealed that anaerobiosis sensitized respiratory adaptation of the revertant to neomycin. It is proposed that oliPR 1 is a mutation resulting in the alteration of plasma membrane premeability to many diverse inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} {{of a new}} type of oligomycin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line (Olir 2. 2) are described in this paper. Olir 2. 2 cells were approximately 50, 000 -fold more resistant to oligomycin than were wild-type CHO cells when tested in glucose-containing medium, but only 10 - to 100 -fold more resistant when tested in galactose-containing medium. Olir 2. 2 cells grew with a doubling time similar to that of wild-type cells both in {{the presence or absence of}} oligomycin. Oligomycin resistance in Olir 2. 2 cells was stable in the absence of drug. In vitro assays indicated that there was approximately a 25 -fold increase in the resistance of the mitochondrial ATPase to inhibition by oligomycin in Olir 2. 2 cells, with little change in the total ATPase activity. The electron transport chain was shown to be functional in Olir 2. 2 cells. Olir 2. 2 cells were cross-resistant to other inhibitors of the mitochondrial ATPase (such as <b>rutamycin,</b> ossamycin, peliomycin, venturicidin, leucinostatin, and efrapeptin) and to other inhibitors of mitochondrial functions (such as chloramphenicol, rotenone, and antimycin). Oligomycin resistance was expressed codominantly in hybrids between Olir 2. 2 cells and wild-type cells. Cross-resistance to ossamycin, peliomycin, chloramphenicol, antimycin, venturicidin, leucinostatin, and efrapeptin was also expressed codominantly in hybrids. Fusions of enucleated Olir 2. 2 cells with wild-type cells and characterization of the resulting cybrid clones indicated that resistance to oligomycin and ossamycin results from a mutation in both a nuclear gene and a cytoplasmic gene. Cross-resistance to efrapeptin, leucinostatin, venturicidin, and antimycin results from a mutation in only a nuclear gene...|$|E
