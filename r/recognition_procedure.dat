40|$|This paper {{examines}} the theoretical {{basis for the}} use of loss <b>recognition</b> <b>procedures</b> in the margin on services valuation method. The loss <b>recognition</b> <b>procedures</b> are compared to relevant sections of the Accounting Conceptual Framework and are found to be inconsistent with that framework. The loss <b>recognition</b> <b>procedures</b> are found to exhibit consistency with some existing accounting standards, but it is suggested that the justification for conservatism in those standards may not be relevant in the life insurance context. 2. Introduction In June 1995 The Institute of Actuaries of Australia issued Professional Standard 201 (PS 201) "Determination of Life Insurance Policy Liabilities". This standard sets out the principles for determining Policy Liabilities under the margin on services valuation method. Section 6 of PS 201 describes the procedures to be followed if the actuary deems it appropriate to change the valuation basis. Changes to the assumed earning rate due to a change in market y [...] ...|$|R

Tulving discovered that some items which participants had failed to recognize during the item recognition trials were recalled successfully during the subsequent recall test.|$|E
50|$|Identifying pitches {{that differ}} by an octave, chroma {{features}} show {{a high degree}} of robustness to variations in timbre and closely correlate to the musical aspect of harmony. This is the reason why chroma features are a well-established tool for processing and analyzing music data. For example, basically every chord <b>recognition</b> <b>procedure</b> relies on some kind of chroma representation. Also, chroma features have become the de facto standard for tasks such as music alignment and synchronization as well as audio structure analysis.

40|$|The {{computer-based}} {{harmonic analysis}} of music recordings {{with the goal}} to automatically extract chord labels directly from the given audio data constitutes a major task in music information retrieval.

In this paper, we analyze {{the role of the}} feature extraction step within the recognition pipeline of various chord <b>recognition</b> <b>procedures</b> based on template matching strategies and hidden Markov models. In particular, we report on numerous experiments which show how the various procedures depend on the type of the underlying chroma feature as well as on parameters that control temporal and spectral aspects. 1...|$|R
40|$|In her article, {{the author}} deals with {{recognition}} of knowledge before the adults’ entry into formal education. Its aim is optimization of education {{with regard to}} time­ and financial input. Recognition of the knowledge that has been acquired through experience and non­formal or informal learning helps adults to develop a more positive self­image and fosters their motivation for learning. In her presentation of the knowledge <b>recognition</b> <b>procedures,</b> the author relies on constructivist theories on knowledge and {{highlights the importance of}} the achieved levels of knowledge, paying equal attention to the low levels (skills), higher levels and the highest levels (problem­solving), none of which should be omitted in the assessment and <b>recognition</b> <b>procedures.</b> The author then presents the experience in knowledge recognition gained {{in the last five years}} by several colleges providing part­time studies, starting with a course in accounting and proceeding with other programmes. It is essential that knowledge recognition should not be pushed into the domain of experts or become an administrative procedure; it must remain part of the regular teaching procedure and under control of the teacher. This requires implementation of appropriate teacher training. Despite the fact that the <b>recognition</b> <b>procedures</b> developed so far have proved to be valid and have gained on credibility, numerous new research issues are being raised in this field...|$|R

Anyone wishing to establish {{themselves as a}} chartered accountant in Luxembourg must hold a degree from the University of Luxembourg and get an authorisation to set up their business. The degree (OEC) consists of 5 exams (Tax Law, Accounting, Ethics, Labour Law, and Corporate Law) {{as well as a}} three-year traineeship in a related position, including at least one year with a qualified employer. Recognition of other national or international qualifications is possible under the mutual <b>recognition</b> <b>procedure</b> allowed by the European Union under the Bologna Process. Professional qualifications leading to recognition as a qualified auditor (Réviseur d'Entreprises Agréé) are different, although they have exams in common with the OEC degree.

OEC is under the direct stewardship of the Ministry of the Economy.|$|E

At Leipzig, he studied neuropathology under Paul Flechsig and experimental psychology with Wilhelm Wundt. Kraepelin would be a disciple of Wundt and had a lifelong interest in experimental psychology based on his theories. While there, Kraepelin wrote a prize-winning essay, [...] "The Influence of Acute Illness in the Causation of Mental Disorders". At Würzburg he completed his Rigorosum (roughly equivalent to an MBBS viva-voce examination) in March 1878, his Staatsexamen (licensing examination) in July 1878, and his Approbation (his license to practice medicine; roughly equivalent to an MBBS) on 9 August 1878. From August 1878 to 1882, he worked with Bernhard von Gudden at the University of Munich. Returning to the University of Leipzig in February 1882, he worked in Wilhelm Heinrich Erb's neurology clinic and in Wundt's psychopharmacology laboratory. He completed his Habilitation thesis at Leipzig; it was entitled [...] "The Place of Psychology in Psychiatry". On 3 December 1883 he completed his [...] (habilitation <b>recognition</b> <b>procedure)</b> at Munich.|$|E

50|$|Smith {{found that}} if {{categories}} with corresponding items were successfully recalled, a systematic decline would occur when recalling the items in a category across the output sequence. He conducted multiple experiments to determine the input conditioned necessary to produce Output Interference. In his first experiment word recall per category was greater at 60 sec than 30 sec when taking the last input category out to prevent recency effect. In his second experiment he changed the instructions, words used, {{and nature of the}} test for retention, and showed with <b>recognition</b> <b>procedure,</b> there was Output Interference but the effect was limited to the first three output positions. Even if retrieving items is necessary for recall, it is not crucial to performance in a recognition tack. Recall of the organized information from long-term memory had a negative effect on the following item recalled. In long-term memory, Smith suggests that Output Interference has effects on extra-core material, which is represented as contextual information, rather than core material, which is highly available as a result of organization. Both short and long term memories are centralized to the hippocampus and the amygdala.|$|E

Cross-section time-series analysis of nine Canadian jurisdictions over nineteen years is used to identify the effect of mandatory votes/ automatic certification on certification success.

This result is robust and significant at the 99 per cent level. ...|$|E
