500|$|Many dog writers {{after the}} early 19th century {{seem to agree}} {{that there were two}} {{varieties}} of terrier existing in Britain at the time—a <b>rough-haired</b> so-called Scotch Terrier and a smooth-haired English Terrier. Thomas Brown, in his Biological Sketches and Authentic Anecdotes of Dogs (1829), states that [...] "the Scotch terrier is certainly the purest in point of breed and the (smooth) English seems to have been produced by a cross from him". [...] Brown went on to describe the Scotch Terrier as [...] "low in stature, with a strong muscular body, short stout legs, a head large in proportion to the body" [...] and was [...] "generally of a sandy colour or black" [...] with a [...] "long, matted and hard" [...] coat. [...] Although the Scotch Terrier described here is more generic than specific to a breed, it asserts the existence of a small, hard, rough-coated terrier developed for hunting small game in the Scottish Highlands in the early 19th century; a description that shares characteristics with what was once known as the Aberdeen Terrier and is today known as the Scottish Terrier. In addition, the paintings of Sir Edwin Landseer and an 1835 lithograph entitled [...] "Scottish Terriers at Work on a Cairn in the West Highlands" [...] both depict Scottie type terriers very similar to those described in the first Scottish Terrier Standard.|$|E

60|$|There {{were two}} <b>rough-haired,</b> unkempt {{horses in the}} tumble-down stable. Holmes raised the hind leg {{of one of them}} and laughed aloud.|$|E
6000|$|There {{suddenly}} appeared {{through the doorway}} a white <b>rough-haired</b> terrier dog, black-marked about the face, with shaggy tan eyebrows. He sniffed at Harz, showed the whites round his eyes, and uttered a sharp bark. A young voice called: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{door was}} opened by a shirt-sleeved young man. He {{was by no}} means an {{unsightly}} young man. Indeed, of his type--the <b>rough-haired,</b> clean-shaven, square-jawed type--he was a distinctly good-looking young man. Even though she was regarding him at the moment purely in the light of a machine for returning strayed cats, Elizabeth noticed that.|$|E
60|$|The little, pale, <b>rough-haired</b> Tom, in his {{perpetual}} {{coating of}} dust, softly {{crept into the}} room, as if he only wanted to elude observation; but Mary and Blanche were at once vociferating their news in his ears, though with little encouragement--he only shook them off abruptly, and would not answer when they required him to be glad.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{thunder and}} a {{whizzing}} {{in the air}} and a sharp rattling noise besides; a strange, damp unwholesome smell too, mixed with that of gunpowder; and when Lucy looked up, she found herself down some steps in a dark, dull, vaulted-looking place, lined with stone, however, and open to the street above. A little lamp was burning in a corner, piles of straw and bits of furniture were lying about, and upon one of the bundles of straw sat a little <b>rough-haired</b> girl.|$|E
60|$|Among Carl's {{class was}} Hank Odell, the senior student, tall, thin, hopelessly plain of face; a drawling, <b>rough-haired,</b> eagle-nosed Yankee, who grinned shyly and whose Adam's apple worked slowly {{up and down}} when you spoke to him; an unimaginative lover of dogs and machinery; the {{descendant}} of Lexington and Gettysburg and a flinty Vermont farm; an ex-fireman, ex-sergeant of the army, and ex-teamster. He always wore a khaki shirt--the wrinkles of which caught the grease in black lines, like veins--with black trousers, blunt-toed shoes, and a pipe, {{the most important part}} of his costume.|$|E
60|$|The path rose a little; {{a narrow}} stream crept {{alongside}} the meadow, and the hedge was spangled with wild roses. Christian kept glancing shyly at the painter. Since their {{meeting on the}} river wall her thoughts had never been at rest. This stranger, with his keen face, insistent eyes, and ceaseless energy, had roused a strange feeling in her; his words had put shape to something in her not yet expressed. She stood aside at a stile {{to make way for}} some peasant boys, dusty and <b>rough-haired,</b> who sang and whistled as they went by.|$|E
60|$|On the {{pavement}} alongside this strange, acquiescing assembly of revolt, about {{to march in}} protest against the conditions of their lives, stood a young woman without a hat and in poor clothes, but {{with a sort of}} beauty in her <b>rough-haired,</b> high cheek-boned, dark-eyed face. She was not one of them; yet, by a stroke of Nature's irony, there was graven on her face alone of all those faces, the true look of rebellion; a haughty, almost fierce, uneasy look--an untamed look. On all the other thousand faces one could see no bitterness, no fierceness, not even enthusiasm; only a half-stolid, half-vivacious patience and eagerness as of children going to a party.|$|E
6000|$|I was stooping in {{the wayside}} ditch in one more attempt to ease my foot, when once again I heard hoofs approaching. With head pushed between the dusty tussocks, I stared along the flat, white road. A small and {{seemingly}} empty cart was bowling {{along in the}} dust. As it drew near, my ears began to sing, my heart stood still. I knew that battered cart, that <b>rough-haired,</b> thick-legged pony. Suddenly I craned up in horror, for {{it seemed that the}} face peering low over the splashboard in my direction was that of a death's-head, grinning at me out of its gloom. Then with a cry of joy I was up and out into the road. [...] "Hi, hi!" [...] I screamed up at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "My lord," [...] said a <b>rough-haired,</b> dark-faced man, {{who walked}} by the knight's other stirrup, {{with his head}} sloped to catch all that he was saying. [...] "By your leave, I {{have no doubt that}} you are skilled in land {{fighting}} and the marshalling of lances, but, by my soul! you will find it another thing upon the sea. I am the master-shipman of this yellow cog, and my name is Goodwin Hawtayne. I have sailed since I was as high as this staff, and I have fought against these Normans and against the Genoese, as well as the Scotch, the Bretons, the Spanish, and the Moors. I tell you, sir, that my ship is over light and over frail for such work, and it will but end in our having our throats cut, or being sold as slaves to the Barbary heathen." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{the next}} evening they set out for Cool-a-vin, Costello riding a {{tolerable}} horse and carrying a sword, the others upon <b>rough-haired</b> garrons, and with their stout cudgels under their arms. As they rode over the bogs and in the boreens among the hills they could see fire answering fire from hill to hill, from horizon to horizon, and everywhere groups who danced in the red light on the turf, celebrating the bridal of life and fire. When they came to Dermott's house they saw before the door an unusually large group of the very poor, dancing about a fire, {{in the midst of}} which was a blazing cartwheel, that circular dance which is so ancient that the gods, long dwindled to be but fairies, dance no other in their secret places. From the door and through the long loop-holes on either side came the pale light of candles and the sound of many feet dancing a dance of Elizabeth and James.|$|E
60|$|The {{one thing}} in Germany that never fails to charm and fascinate me is the German dog. In England one grows tired of the old breeds, one knows them all so well: the mastiff, the plum-pudding dog, the terrier (black, white or <b>rough-haired,</b> {{as the case may}} be, but always quarrelsome), the collie, the bulldog; never {{anything}} new. Now in Germany you get variety. You come across dogs the like of which you have never seen before: that until you hear them bark you do not know are dogs. It is all so fresh, so interesting. George stopped a dog in Sigmaringen and drew our attention to it. It suggested a cross between a codfish and a poodle. I would not like to be positive it was not a cross between a codfish and a poodle. Harris tried to photograph it, but it ran up a fence and disappeared through some bushes.|$|E
6000|$|Costello {{had come}} up from the fields and lay upon the ground before {{the door of his}} square tower, resting his head upon his hands and looking at the sunset, and {{considering}} the chances of the weather. Though the customs of Elizabeth and James, now going out of fashion in England, had begun to prevail among the gentry, he still wore the great cloak of the native Irish; and the sensitive outlines of his face and the greatness of his indolent body had a commingling of pride and strength which belonged to a simpler age. His eyes wandered from the sunset to where the long white road lost itself over the south-western horizon and to a horseman who toiled slowly up the hill. A few more minutes and the horseman was near enough for his little and shapeless body, his long Irish cloak, and the dilapidated bagpipes hanging from his shoulders, and the <b>rough-haired</b> garron under him, to be seen distinctly in the grey dusk. So soon as he had come within earshot, he began crying: 'Is it sleeping you are, Tumaus Costello, when better men break their hearts on the great white roads? Get up out of that, proud Tumaus, for I have news! Get up out of that, you great omadhaun! Shake yourself out of the earth, you great weed of a man!' ...|$|E
60|$|Now it {{happened}} that {{a few months before}} some travellers who had guested at our house gave Suzanne a little <b>rough-haired</b> dog bred of parents which had been brought from England. Of this dog Suzanne grew very fond, and when it fell sick of the distemper she was in much distress. So it came about that one afternoon Suzanne put the dog in a basket, and taking with her an old Hottentot to carry it, set out upon her grey mare for the valley where Sihamba lived. Now Sihamba had her hut and the huts of the few people in her service in a recess {{at the end of the}} valley, so placed that until you were quite on to them you would never have guessed that they were there. Down this valley Suzanne rode, the Hottentot with the basket on his head trotting by her side, till turning the corner she came upon a scene which she had very little expected. In one part of the open space beyond her, herded by some Kaffirs, were a number of cattle, sheep and goats. Opposite to them in the shadow under the hillside stood the huts of Sihamba, and in front of these grew a large tree. Beneath this tree was Sihamba herself with scarcely any clothing on her, for she had been stripped, her tiny wrists bound together behind her back and a rope about her neck, of which one end was thrown over a bough of the tree. In front of her, laughing brutally, stood none other than Swart Piet and with him a small crowd of men, mostly half-breed wanderers of the sort that trek from place to place claiming hospitality on the grounds of cousinship or poverty, until they are turned off as a nuisance. Also there were present a few Kaffirs, either headmen in Swart Piet's pay or some of his dark associates in witchcraft.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thus, at the {{beginning}} of our journey to the far south, where we go to look first on those bright lands, which have hotter suns and a greater variety than ours, we come to the wilderness of Coradine, which seems barren and desolate to our sight, accustomed to the deep verdure of woods and valleys, and the blue mists of an abundant moisture. There a stony soil brings forth only thorns, and thistles, and sere tufts of grass; and blustering winds rush over the unsheltered reaches, where the <b>rough-haired</b> goats huddle for warmth; and there is no melody save the many-toned voices of the wind and the plover's wild cry. There dwell the children of Coradine, on the threshold of the wind-vexed wilderness, where the stupendous columns of green glass uphold the roof of the House of Coradine; the ocean's voice is in their rooms, and the inland-blowing wind brings to them the salt spray and yellow sand swept at low tide from the desolate floors of the sea, and the white-winged bird flying from the black tempest screams aloud in their shadowy halls. There, from the high terraces, when the moon is at its full, we see the children of Coradine gathered together, arrayed like no others, in shining garments of gossamer threads, when, like thistle-down chased by eddying winds, now whirling in a cloud, now scattering far apart, they dance their moonlight dances on the wide alabaster floors; and coming and going they pass away, and seem to melt into the moonlight, yet ever to return again with changeful melody and new measures. And, seeing this, all those things in which we ourselves excel seem poor in comparison, becoming pale in our memories. For the winds and waves, and the whiteness and grace, has been ever with them; and the winged seed of the thistle, and the flight of the gull, and the storm-vexed sea, flowering in foam, and the light of the moon on sea and barren land, have taught them this art, and a swiftness and grace which they alone possess.|$|E
