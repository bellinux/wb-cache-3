25|$|A {{series of}} {{cultural}} investments {{were carried out}} in 1958: the newspaper Det nye Kingsbay was published, a public library was established and the school {{moved to a new}} building. By 1959 Ester I was depleted and the railway was closed—transport having been taken over by trucks. That year only 8,000 tonnes were exported. A new shaft was opened the following year, allowing mining to start in Vestre Senterfelt. Production in 1960 hit a record 79,000 tonnes of <b>raw</b> <b>coal,</b> which after being processed through the new coal preparation plant resulted in 51,000 tonnes. Start of a coke plant in Mo i Rana helped stimulate the domestic coal demand. Washed coal production hit 54,000 tonnes in 1961. By then NOK21 million had been invested in the past years, although the coal prices had continued to fall, and especially in Norway the demand had diminished. Norway was retiring its last steam locomotives, but unlike in most of Europe it was not replicating the coal demand through construction of coal-fueled thermal power plants. By 1962 Ny-Ålesund had 25 family apartments and barracks for 210 male employees. Production hit 75,000 tonnes of washed coal in 1962.|$|E
2500|$|Most thermal {{stations}} use coal as {{the main}} fuel. <b>Raw</b> <b>coal</b> is transported from coal mines to a power station site by trucks, barges, bulk cargo ships or railway cars. Generally, when shipped by railways, the coal cars are sent as a full train of cars. The coal received at site may be of different sizes. The railway cars are unloaded at site by rotary dumpers or side tilt dumpers to tip over onto conveyor belts below. The coal is generally conveyed to crushers which crush the coal to about [...] size. The crushed coal is then sent by belt conveyors to a storage pile. Normally, the crushed coal is compacted by bulldozers, as compacting of highly volatile coal avoids spontaneous ignition.|$|E

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) {{was used to determine}} functional forms of the <b>raw</b> <b>coals,</b> acid-treated coals, respective chars prepared at 740 and 980 °C in a bench-scale fluidised-bed (FB), and at 1000 and 1400 °C in a drop-tube furnace (DTF), as well as their corresponding de-ashed remnants. The XPS N 1 s spectra for the <b>raw</b> <b>coals</b> were typically similar to previous widely reported bituminous coals, of which pyrrolic nitrogen was the predominant form of organically bound nitrogen, followed by pyridinic and quaternary nitrogen. In pyrolysed chars, quaternary nitrogen was the dominant form followed by pyridinic, pyrrolic and protonated-/oxidised heterocyclic nitrogen forms respectively. Nonetheless, XPS N 1 s analysis for DTF severely pyrolysed chars (1000 and 1400 °C) prepared from high ash and vitrinite-rich coal, and also a char (1400 °C) from a relatively low ash and inertinite-rich coal, gave a spectra with only two sub-peaks corresponding to quaternary and pyridinic nitrogen. It seems that the HCl/HF/HCl sequential demineralising/de-ashing process had no effect on the nitrogen functional forms of <b>raw</b> <b>coals</b> and the entire chars prepared from the FB. De-ashing of DTF severely pyrolysed chars emanating from high ash and inertinite-rich coal exhibited no marked change to the nitrogen functional forms. However, acid treatment of DTF chars derived from a high ash and vitrinite-rich coal, a char from relatively low ash and inertinite-rich coal, which initially contained pyridinic and quaternary nitrogen resulted in additional nitrogen moieties of pyrrolic and protonated/oxidised nitrogen...|$|R

50|$|The {{tube mill}} output (responding to boiler load demand) is {{controlled}} by regulating the primary air-flow.

40|$|Coal {{contains}} many potentially harmful trace elements. Coal combustion in unvented stoves, which {{is common in}} most parts of rural China, can release harmful emissions into the air that when inhaled cause health issues. However, few studies have dealt specifically with the toxicological mechanisms of the particulate matter (PM) released by coal and other solid fuel combustion. In this paper, PM 10 particles that were generated during laboratory stove combustion of <b>raw</b> powdered <b>coal,</b> clay-mixed honeycomb briquettes, and wood charcoal were analysed for morphology, trace element compositions, and toxicity as represented by oxidative DNA damage. The analyses included Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM), Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Plasmid Scission Assay (PSA). Gravimetric analysis indicated that the equivalent mass concentration of PM 10 emitted by burning <b>raw</b> powdered <b>coal</b> was higher than that derived by burning honeycomb briquette. FESEM observation revealed that the coal burning-derived PM 10 particles were mainly soot aggregates. The PSA results showed that the PM 10 emitted by burning honeycomb briquettes had a higher oxidative capacity than that from burning <b>raw</b> powdered <b>coal</b> and wood charcoal. It is also demonstrated that the oxidative capacity of the whole particle suspensions were {{similar to those of the}} water soluble fractions; indicating that the DNA damage induced by coal burning-derived PM 10 were mainly a result of the water-soluble fraction. An ICP-MS analysis revealed that the amount of total analysed water-soluble elements in the PM 10 emitted by burning honeycomb briquettes was higher than that in PM produced by burning <b>raw</b> powdered <b>coal,</b> and both were higher than PM from burning wood charcoal. The total analysed water-soluble elements in these coal burning-derived PM 10 samples had a significantly positive correlation with the level of DNA damage; indicating that the oxidative capacity of the coal burning-derived PM 10 was mainly sourced from the water soluble elements. The water-soluble As, Cd, Ge, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, Tl, and Zn showed the highest correlation with the oxidative potential, implying that these elements in their water soluble states were the primary responsible factor for the plasmid DNA damage. The exposure risk was further assessed using the particle mass concentrations multiplied by the percent of DNA damage under the dose of 500 μg ml− 1. The results revealed that the exposure risk of burning <b>raw</b> powdered <b>coal</b> was much higher than that of burning honeycomb briquette...|$|R
