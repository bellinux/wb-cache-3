60|$|Another {{important}} <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation,</b> attained in {{the seventeenth}} century, was the proof and quantitative estimation of physical inertia. In the old philosophy, a curious conjunction of ethical and physical prejudices had led {{to the notion that}} there was something ethically bad and physically obstructive about matter. Aristotle attributes all irregularities and apparent dysteleologies in nature to the disobedience, or sluggish yielding, of matter to the shaping and guiding influence of those reasons and causes which were hypostatised in his ideal 'Forms.' In modern science, the conception of the inertia, or resistance to change, of matter is complex. In part, it contains a corollary from the law of causation: A body cannot change its state in respect of rest or motion without a sufficient cause. But, in part, it contains generalisations from experience. One of these {{is that there is no}} such sufficient cause resident in any body, and that therefore it will rest, or continue in motion, so long as no external cause of change acts upon it. The other is that the effect which the impact of a body in motion produces upon the body on which it impinges depends, other things being alike, on the relation of a certain quality of each which is called 'mass.' Given a cause of motion of a certain value, the amount of motion, measured by distance travelled in a certain time, which it will produce in a given quantity of matter, say a cubic inch, is not always the same, but depends on what that matter is--a cubic inch of iron will go faster than a cubic inch of gold. Hence, it appears, that since equal amounts of motion have, ex hypothesi, been produced, the amount of motion in a body does not depend on its speed alone, but on some property of the body. To this the name of 'mass' has been given. And since it seems reasonable to suppose that a large quantity of matter, moving slowly, possesses as much motion as a small quantity moving faster, 'mass' has been held to express 'quantity of matter.' It is further demonstrable that, at any given time and place, the relative mass of any two bodies is expressed by the ratio of their weights.|$|E

Both the viruses are transmitted by the same mosquitoes, but PaRV is not transmitted to humans, unlike RRV.

[...] The reason, explained by Jody Hobson-Peters of the University of Queensland, is that if mosquitoes (vectors for human diseases) are infected with the PaRV, then they will {{no longer be able to}} carry other human-infectious viruses.|$|E
5000|$|The system {{safety concept}} {{calls for a}} risk {{management}} strategy based on identification, analysis of hazards and application of remedial controls using a systems-based approach. [...] This is different from traditional safety strategies which rely on control of conditions and causes of an accident based either on the Epidemiological analysis or as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>investigation</b> of individual past accidents. The concept of system safety is useful in demonstrating adequacy of technologies when difficulties are faced with probabilistic risk analysis. The underlying principle is one of synergy: a whole is more than sum of its parts. Systems-based approach to safety requires the application of scientific, technical and managerial skills to hazard identification, hazard analysis, and elimination, control, or management of hazards throughout the life-cycle of a system, program, project or an activity or a product.
