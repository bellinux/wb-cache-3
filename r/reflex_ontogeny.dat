40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} lipids from goat milk containing conjugated linoleic acids on body weight and <b>reflex</b> <b>ontogeny</b> of neonatal rats treated during the prenatal and suckling periods. Methods: Three groups were studied: soybean oil (S), coconut oil (C), and goat milk lipids (GM). Reflex maturation (palm grasp, righting reflex, cliff avoidance, vibrissae placing, negative geotaxis, auditory startle, and free-fall righting) as well as body weight evolution were recorded during lactation. Results: Data demonstrated that the lipids from goat milk accelerated body weight evolution {{as well as all}} the reflex maturation investigated (P < 0. 05). Discussion: The supply of goat?s milk offered to Wistar rats during pregnancy and lactation provided a variety of fatty acids necessary to accelerate the development of offspring. 201...|$|E
40|$|The {{maternal}} {{exposure to}} high fat diet (HFD) during pregnancy and breastfeeding {{have been considered}} an important inducer of alterations in offspring normal programming, both in animals and humans, and may disturb brain development. In the present study we investigated the somatic and sensory-motor development of the offspring from rat dams fed a HFD, compared with dams fed a control diet, during pregnancy or lactation. Indicators of the body growth, physical maturation, and <b>reflex</b> <b>ontogeny</b> were evaluated. Offspring of dams fed a HFD showed reduced weight and body growth, delayed physical maturation, and delayed maturation of the physiological reflexes, such as vibrissa placing, auditory startle response, and free-fall righting. Our findings suggest that maternal HFD during pregnancy or lactation modifies somatic and neurological development of the offspring, possibly increasing the risk of neuroendocrine and neuropsychiatric disorders later in life...|$|E

The possibility exists that increased brain serotonin availability in young animals modulates their neuro-behavioral responses. This study investigated the body weight gain and <b>reflex</b> <b>ontogeny</b> of neonatal rats treated during the suckling period with two doses of citalopram (5 mg, or 10 mg/kg, sc, daily). The time of the appearance of reflexes (palm grasp righting, free-fall righting, vibrissa placing, auditory startle response, negative geotaxis and cliff avoidance) as well as the body weight evolution were recorded. In general, a delay in the time of reflex development and a reduced weight gain were observed in drug-treated animals. These findings suggest that serotoninergic mechanisms play a role in modulating body weight gain and the maturation of most reflex responses during the perinatal period in rats...|$|E
40|$|Occupational {{exposure}} and sniffing of volatile organic solvents {{continue to be}} a worldwide health problem, raising the risk for teratogenic sequelae of maternal inhalant abuse. Real life exposures usually involve simultaneous exposures to multiple solvents, and almost all the abused solvents contain a mixture of two or more different volatile compounds. However, several studies examined the teratogenicity due to industrial exposure to a single volatile solvent but investigating the teratogenic potential of complex chemical mixture such as thinner remains unexplored. This study was undertaken to evaluate developmental neurotoxicity of paint thinner using a mouse model. Mated female mice (N = 21) were, therefore, exposed to repeated and brief inhalation episodes of 0, 300 or 600 ppm of thinner during the entire period of pregnancy. Females weigh was recorded and their standard fertility and reproductive parameters were assessed. After birth postnatal day 1 (PND 1), offspring (N = 88) length and body weight were measured in a daily basis. At PND 5, the pups were assessed for their postnatal growth, physical maturation, reflex development, neuromotor abilities, sensory function, activity level, anxiety, depression, learning and memory functions. At adulthood, structural changes of the hippocampus were examined by estimating the total volume of the dentate gyrus. Except one case of thinner induced abortion at the higher dose, our results showed that the prenatal exposure to the solvent did not cause any maternal toxicity or decrease in the viability of the offspring. Therefore, a lower birth weight, decrease in the litter size and delayed <b>reflexes</b> <b>ontogeny</b> were registered in prenatally exposed offspring to both 300 ppm and 600 ppm of thinner. In addition, prenatally exposure to thinner resulted in increased anxiolytic- and depression-like behaviors. In contrast, impaired learning and memory functions and decreased hippocampal dentate gyrus volume were revealed only in the prenatally treated offspring by 600 ppm of thinner. Based on these results, we can conclude that prenatally exposure to paint thinner causes a long-lasting developmental neurotoxicity and alters a wide range of behavioral functions in mice. This shows the risk that mothers who abuse thinner paint expose their offspring...|$|R

40|$|Mirtazapine is {{an often}} used {{antidepressant}} drug; however insufficient {{information is available}} regarding its safety during pregnancy. Therefore, this work was initiated to study the effect of prenatal exposure of mirtazapine on postnatal developments of rats. The study was conducted on pregnant rats to observe the safety profile of mirtazapine in comparison to control. The percentage weight gain, gestation period and litter size of the rats treated with double therapeutic dose (DTD) was {{significantly lower than the}} rats treated with therapeutic dose (TD) and rats of control group. However the litter size of the TD treated rats was also found smaller than the control. The offspring were examined through battery of test in order to evaluate their developmental neurotoxicity. The test includes the assessment of postnatal growth, <b>reflex</b> <b>ontogeny,</b> neuromotor abilities, activity level, emotional reactivity and learning ability. The DTD exposure negatively affected on overall growth of pups in comparison to TD exposed pups and control group. Further, the amine concentration in brain was also found significantly lower in DTD exposed pups. Therefore, this study reveals that the treatment of pregnant rats with TD and DTD decreases their litter size. In addition the prenatal exposure of DTD of mirtazapine negatively affects on neurodevelopment of rats...|$|E

A serotonina influencia o crescimento e o desenvolvimento do sistema nervoso e sua expressão comportamental. O aumento da disponibilidade de serotonina no cérebro de ratos jovens parece modular as respostas neurocomportamentais. Neste estudo, foram investigados o ganho de peso corporal e a ontogênese dos reflexos em ratos neonatos, tratados diariamente, durante o período de aleitamento, com duas doses de citalopram (5 ou 10 mg/Kg de peso corporal, via subcutânea). Foram avaliados, o tempo de aparecimento dos reflexos (preensão palmar, endireitamento, colocação pelas vibrissas, resposta ao susto, geotáxico negativo e aversão ao precipício), e a evolução do peso corporal. Foi observado atraso no tempo de desenvolvimento de alguns reflexos e redução no ganho de peso corporal. Os achados em ratos sugerem que as alterações no ganho de peso corporal e na maturação dos reflexos são programadas, durante o período perinatal, com participação de mecanismos serotoninérgicos de modulação...|$|E
