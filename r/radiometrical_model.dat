40|$|POLDER (POLarization and Directionality of the Earth Reflectances) is a French Instrument {{that will}} be flown {{on-board}} ADEOS (ADvanced Earth Observing Satellite) polar orbiting satellite, scheduled to be launched in august 1996. POLDER is a multispectral imaging radiometer/polarimeter designed to collect global and repetitive observations of the solar radiation reflected by the Earth/Atmosphere System, with a wide field of view (2400 km) and a moderate geometric resolution (6 km). The instrument concept is based on telecentric optics, on a rotating wheel carrying 15 spectral filters and polarisers, and on a bidimensionnal CCD detector array. In addition to the classical measurement and mapping characteristics of a narrow-band imaging radiometer, POLDER has a unique ability to measure polarized reflectances at three different polarization angles (for three of its eight visible and near-infrared spectral bands), and to observe target reflectances from 14 different viewing directions during a single satellite pass. All the data transmitted by POLDER are processed in the POLDER Processing Centre. Level 1 products include geometrically and radiometrically corrected data, level 2 products are elementary geophysical products created from a single satellite pass, and level 3 products are geophysical synthesis from several passes of the satellite. This paper presents the radiometrical and geometrical algorithms of the level 1 processing: new algorithms developed {{for the removal of}} sensor artefacts (smearing, stray light), for the <b>radiometrical</b> <b>model</b> inversion (normalized radiance and polarizatio...|$|E
