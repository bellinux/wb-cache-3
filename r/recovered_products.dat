40|$|Returned {{products}} take {{a considerable}} part in logistics. Recovering the returned products {{is one of}} the management issues of manufacturing companies. As an element of reverse logistics, product recovery encompasses several options, i. e., remanufacturing, repair, refurbishing, cannibalization and recycling, which are classified based on the degree of disassembly and the quality level of the recovered product. Difference in quality levels of <b>recovered</b> <b>products</b> draw different prices in the secondary markets. This situation gives rise to revenue management, i. e., to set the prices of <b>recovered</b> <b>products</b> of different quality levels such that the total revenue is maximized. One of the decision problems is the location of collection and inspection points in order to minimize the cost of reverse distribution. In our framework, we include preliminary inspection, that requires physical checking etc. and needs no substantial investment, at the collection points, and detailed inspection at the remanufacturing facility.

40|$|A {{stochastic}} programming model for designing logistics networks integrating reverse logistics into current supply chains is proposed in this paper. It aims at evaluating impacts of randomness related to recovery, processing and demand volumes {{on the design}} decisions. These decisions deal with the location of service and processing centres and warehouses, regarding processed products with reuse potential, the definition of mission of sites and, consequently, the product accessibility. Flows of <b>recovered</b> <b>products</b> may be directed toward one or a number of processing alternatives, according to the different states of the <b>recovered</b> <b>products</b> {{as well as to}} the network conditions, which relate to recovery and demand volumes with respect to capacity constraints and operating costs. Notably, <b>recovered</b> <b>products</b> may be repaired, disassembled for part refurbishing or disposed. Such products are indicated here as valorized products and represent an economical supply alternative, which meets lower quality standards in comparison with new products. Portions of needs fulfilled by valorized products are defined according to the requirements of end-users, as well as management policies and strategies. The model aims at improving valorized product accessibility, while reducing the total operating costs of such a network. A heuristics based on the sample average approximation, involving the Monte Carlo sampling methods, is proposed to solve the problem. ...|$|E

40|$|A {{sample of}} {{pinewood}} sawdust was rapidly pre-processed in a torrefaction-type procedure, separately in subcritical water (neutral) and with added Na 2 CO 3 (alkaline compound) and Nb 2 O 5 (solid acid) in a batch reactor. The original sawdust {{and the three}} friable solid <b>recovered</b> <b>products</b> from the hydrothermal procedure were characterized in detail. The solid <b>recovered</b> <b>products</b> (SRPs) gave higher C/O and C/H ratios, higher calorific values and reduced moisture contents compared to the original sawdust.

With increasing pyrolysis temperature, the pre-processed samples produced more CO and H 2, far more char and less tar than the original sawdust. The trends in the composition of gases and the yields of char suggested a combination of Boudouard reaction and CO 2 dry reforming as the predominant reactions during pyrolysis. For all samples, increased temperature led to reduced tar production with an increase in the aromatic oxygenates and aromatic hydrocarbon contents of the tar. At 800 °C, the ratio of aromatic hydrocarbons increased dramatically particularly from the sample pre-processed with Nb 2 O 5 indicating possible deoxygenation catalysis...|$|E

Effective product recovery can help to reduce the demand for raw materials, energy consumption, and landfill space.

The profitability of product recovery operations depends on the quality and volume of product returns as well as the demand for <b>recovered</b> <b>products</b> however these factors are not directly controllable. Aims to investigate to what extent the benefit of product recovery can be captured seven scenarios are developed and discussed with an analytical approach. The costs of possible recovery options are analyzed for determining the optimal recovery policy in different scenarios.

By conducting a number of experiments the factors that impact the choice of optimal recovery policy are identified, which including the timing, volume and quality of returned product, the price fluctuation of <b>recovered</b> <b>products</b> in the market, and the resell potential of secondary market.
