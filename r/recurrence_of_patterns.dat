50|$|It {{has been}} argued that, in regard to {{multiple}} discovery, science and art are similar.

In the card sorting technique, {{a variety of methods}} are used to analyse the resulting data. The analysis of card sorting data helps user experience (UX) designers to discover the patterns in how users make classifications and thus to develop an optimal, user-centred website structure. During analysis, the <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>patterns</b> of classification between users influences the resulting website structure. However, the algorithm used in the analysis influences the recurrent patterns found and thus has consequences for the resulting website design.

The research focuses on how the same data for card sorting can lead to different website structures by generating different set of classifications.

40|$|Fractal {{geometry}} {{has experienced}} spectacular success in quantifying the complex structure exhibited by many natural patterns, including coastlines, trees and clouds (1). In {{contrast to the}} simplicity of Euclidean shapes, the complexity of fractal patterns results from the <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>patterns</b> at finer and finer scales. Here we show that humans display a consistent aesthetic preference across fractal images, regardless of whether these images are generated by nature s processes, by mathematics, or by humans. The study of human aesthetic judgement in general, and of fractal patterns in particular, constitutes a relatively new research field within perceptual psychology. Previous studies of fractal objects have focussed predominantly on how fractal character influences perceived visual qualities such as roughness and complexity. Only recently has research started to quantify people's visual preferences for (or against) fractal content. To determine {{if there is any}} universal aesthetic quality of fractals, we have carried out a comprehensive study incorporating three categories of fractal pattern: 1. natural fractals- scenery such as trees, mountains, waves, etc; 2. mathematical fractals- computer simulations of coastlines; 3. human fractals- cropped sections of paintings by the artist Jackson Pollock that have recently been shown to be fractal (2) ...|$|E

30|$|The goal of {{catalytic}} authenticity {{also can}} be pursued {{at the level of}} individuals. That is, individuals should take what is learned from research to transform their practices and benefit accordingly. However, some individuals are not well placed to access and appropriate what is learned from research. Accordingly, those involved in the research, who are well positioned to improve equity, should act to help those who are not appropriately placed to take advantage of what is being learned from the research. There are many scenarios that might apply, but most importantly, those with the power to transform should do so, using what is learned from research to improve the social lives of those who would potentially benefit from the changes. This goal avoids a situation in which researchers are learning but do not make efforts to improve social justice, based on what they have learned from the research. Authentic inquiry embraces an ethical responsibility to act to benefit others, especially those who are not ideally placed to benefit from what has been learned from research. At the heart of tactical authenticity is reflexivity, becoming aware of the unaware, watching out for <b>recurrences</b> <b>of</b> <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> disadvantage, and acting with conviction to the benefit of those who are disadvantaged (Bourdieu 1992). In a context of wellness we carefully monitored blood oxygenation levels and pulse rate of coteachers and, as they approached thresholds of concern, we intervened so that teachers would not risk initiating health crises. Most commonly, this involved surprisingly low levels of blood oxygenation (i.e., less that 90 % and in some cases less than 70 %).|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> and their association with clinical outcome in locally advanced cervical cancer (LACC) patients submitted to primary chemoradiation (CTRT) followed by radical surgery (RS). Methods This study was conducted on 364 LACC patients treated with CTRT plus RS since January 1996 to July 2012. For each relapse, information on date <b>of</b> clinical/pathological <b>recurrence,</b> and <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> disease presentation were retrieved. Post-relapse survival (PRS) was recorded from the date <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> to the date of death for disease or last seen. Survival probabilities were compared by the log rank test. Cox's regression model with stepwise variable selection was used for multivariate prognostic analysis for PRS. Results Within a median follow-up of 42 months, 75 recurrences (20. 6 %) and 54 disease-associated deaths (14. 8 %) were recorded. By analysing the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> relapse, most <b>of</b> the <b>recurrences</b> were outside the irradiated field (n = 43, 57. 3 %) and the most frequently observed site was visceral (n = 16, 21. 3 %).

Evidence from several laboratories indicates that functioning, relations, and processing of a stress-related molecule, proopiomelanocortin (POMC) may be perturbed among certain subgroups of individuals exhibiting SIB. The current investigation employed a unique time-pattern analysis program (THEME) to examine whether recurrent temporal <b>patterns</b> (T-patterns) <b>of</b> SIB were related to morning levels of two POMC-derived hormones: beta-endorphin (beta E) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). THEME was used to quantify highly significant (non-random) T-patterns that included SIB within a dataset of in situ observational recordings spanning 8 days (similar to 40 h) in 25 subjects with DD. Pearson's product-moment analyses revealed highly significant correlations between the percentage of T-patterns containing SIB and basal levels of both beta E and ACTH, which were not found with any other "control" T-patterns.

The findings indicate that the constraints of the currency board in Bulgaria shifted economic activity towards the private sector, while the discretionary policies in Romania turned public finances into both a contributor and a response mechanism to economic imbalances. While the prospects of EU accession initially enhanced the performance of the monetary anchors, the implicit insurance of EU membership increased moral hazard and led to a rapid rise in private (more pronounced in Bulgaria) and public debt (more pronounced in Romania). We propose also some historical parallels between our sample period 1997 - 2009 and the years 1925 - 1940 and identify similar differences between the monetary regimes of Bulgaria and Romania.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{growth in}} connection speed allows {{huge amounts of}} data to be transferred through a network. An important issue {{in this context is}} network traffic analysis to profile communications and detect security threats. Association rule extraction is a widely used exploratory technique which has been exploited in different contexts (e. g., network traffic characterization). However, to discover (potentially relevant) knowledge a very low support threshold needs to be enforced hence generating a large number of unmanageable rules. To address this issue in network traffic analysis, an efficient technique to reduce traffic volume is needed. This paper presents a NEtwork Digest framework, which performs network traffic analysis by means of data mining techniques to characterize traffic data and detect anomalies. NED exploits continuous queries to efficiently perform realtime aggregation of captured network data and supports filtering operations to further reduce traffic volume focusing on relevant data. Furthermore, NED provides an efficient algorithm to perform refinement analysis by means of association rules to discover traffic features.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{update the}} {{analysis}} of technical and biologic factors related to hepatic resection for colorectal metastasis in a large single-institution series to identify important prognostic indicators and <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> failure. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Surgical therapy for colorectal carcinoma metastatic to the liver is the only potentially curable treatment. Careful patient selection of those with resectable liver-only metastatic disease {{is crucial to the}} success of surgical therapy. METHODS: Two hundred forty-four consecutive patients undergoing curative hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal carcinoma were analyzed retrospectively. Variables examined included sex, stage of primary lesion, size of liver lesion(s), number of lesions, disease-free interval, ploidy, differentiation, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen level, and operative factors such as resection margin, use of cryotherapy, intraoperative ultrasound, and blood loss. RESULTS: Surgical margin, number of lesions, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels significantly control prognosis. Patients with only one or two liver lesions, a 1 -cm surgical margin, and low CEA levels have a 5 -year disease-free survival rate of more than 30 %. Disease-free interval, original stage, bilobar involvement, size of metastasis, differentiation, and ploidy were not significant predictors <b>of</b> <b>recurrence.</b> The <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> failure correlates with surgical margin. Routine use of intraoperative ultrasound resulted in an increased incidence of negative surgical margin during the period examined. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection or cryotherapy of hepatic metastasis from colorectal cancer is safe and curable in appropriately selected patients. Biologic factors, such as number of lesions and carcinoembryonic antigen levels, determine potential curability, and surgical margin governs the <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> failure and outcome in potentially curable patients.

40|$|OBJECTIVE(S) : To {{investigate}} {{rates and}} <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> in patients following curative intent surgery for colorectal liver metastasis. BACKGROUND: Outcomes following surgical management of colorectal liver metastasis have largely focused on overall survival. Contemporary data on rates and <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> following surgery for colorectal liver metastasis are limited. METHODS: One thousand six hundred sixty-nine patients treated with surgery (resection +/- radiofrequency ablation [RFA]) for colorectal liver metastasis between 1982 and 2008 were identified from an international multi-institutional database. Clinicopathologic data, recurrence patterns, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were analyzed. RESULTS: At {{the time of}} the initial liver-directed surgery, surgical treatment was resection only (90. 2 %), resection plus RFA (8. 0 %), or RFA alone (1. 8 %). While 5 -year overall survival was 47. 3 %, 947 (56. 7 %) patients recurred with a median RFS time of 16. 3 months. First recurrence site was intrahepatic only (43. 2 %), extrahepatic only (35. 8 %), intra- and extrahepatic (21. 0 %). There was no difference in RFS based on site <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> (intrahepatic: 16. 9 months; extrahepatic: 16. 6 months; intra- and extrahepatic: 16. 2 month; P > 0. 05). Receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with overall recurrence risk (hazard ratio [HR] = 0. 56), while history of RFA (HR = 2. 39, P = 0. 001) and R 1 margin status (HR = 1. 36) were predictive <b>of</b> intrahepatic <b>recurrence.</b> <b>Pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> and RFS remained similar following repeat surgery for recurrent disease. CONCLUSIONS: While 5 -year survival following surgery for colorectal liver metastasis approaches 50 %, over one-half <b>of</b> patients develop <b>recurrence</b> within 2 years. The <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> failure is distributed relatively equally among intrahepatic, extrahepatic, and intra- plus extrahepatic sites. Patients undergoing repeat surgery for recurrent metastasis have similar <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>recurrence</b> and RFS time...|$|R
