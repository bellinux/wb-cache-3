Before departure U-853 was fitted with a Schnorchel, a retractable air intake and exhaust that allowed the ship to remain submerged while <b>running</b> <b>her</b> diesel engines. The Schnorchel reduced the need to spend dangerous periods on the surface recharging batteries.|$|E

5|$|The wreck is {{generally}} intact although draped with snagged fishing nets. The aft turret, however, has fallen out off the ship. The vertical {{position of the}} wreck has inspired a new theory of her loss by nautical archaeologist Vello Mäss. He believes that Rusalka was taking on water forward, perhaps from a leak or through ventilation hatches and was bow-heavy when her captain {{decided to make a}} turn, possibly to return to Reval, and the ship capsized during the turn with her engines still <b>running.</b> <b>Her</b> forward speed and flooded forward hull meant that she descended vertically and drove her hull into the muddy sea bottom.|$|E

Maggie, however, resents Betty's interference and persuades landlord Jack Walker (Arthur Leslie) to give Betty {{a job as a}} barmaid at The Rovers Return Inn public house. Betty clashes with the landlady Annie (Doris Speed), who fears that Jack may find her attractive, and fires Betty as a result. Betty takes a job in a rival pub, and returns only when Annie apologises.

5|$|In 1917, in {{response}} to the wave of anti-German feeling that surrounded the war, George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. He also disposed of his family's German titles and styles, so Christian, Helena and their daughters simply became Prince and Princess Christian; Princess Helena Victoria and Marie Louise with no territorial designation. Helena's surviving son, Albert, fought {{on the side of the}} Prussians, though he made it clear that he would not fight against his mother's country. In the same year, on 8 October, Prince Christian died at Schomberg House. Her last years were spent arguing with Commissioners, who tried to turn her out of Schomberg and Cumberland Lodge because of the expense of <b>running</b> <b>her</b> households. They failed, as clear evidence of her right to live in those residences for life was shown.|$|E
5|$|She {{moved to}} the Busch Series (now called Xfinity Series) in 1991 where she {{struggled}} to perform well but achieved one pole position in 1994.

In 1999, she returned to active competition in the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series where she ran strongly, and finished sixth in the series championship standings the following year. Robinson returned to NASCAR in 2001, and made her debut in the Winston Cup Series (now the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) but was unable to compete successfully. She retired from racing four years later to focus on her family and concentrate on <b>running</b> <b>her</b> interior design and furniture business.|$|E
5|$|Jamaica-born former Clemson University athlete Cydonie Mothersill {{qualified}} for the women's 200meter dash and participated {{on behalf of the}} Cayman Islands. 30 {{years old at the time}} of the Beijing Olympics, Mothersill had been participating in the Olympics since she was 18 at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. She also attended the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, but only started <b>running</b> <b>her</b> present event in Sydney. In Beijing, Mothersill participated in the first round of her event on 18 August, where she was placed in Heat 1 versus the United States' Muna Lee and France's Muriel Hurtis-Houari. Mothersill ranked third in the heat with a time of 22.76seconds, placing behind Hurtis-Houari by 0.04seconds. Overall, Mothersill ranked third in the event out of 48 athletes, behind Lee and Hurtis-Houari. She progressed to the 19 August second round and was placed in Heat 1, which included Jamaica's Veronica Campbell and the Bahamas' Debbie Ferguson. Mothersill ranked fourth of eight, earning a time of 22.83seconds. She fell behind Ferguson by 0.06seconds, and placed ahead of fifth place heat finalist Ionela Tirlea of Romania by 0.29seconds. Cydonie Mothersill tied Muna Lee in Round 2 for ninth place out of 32 athletes. Mothersill {{qualified for}} semifinals on 20 August, and was placed in Heat 2.

5|$|Roughly a {{thousand}} {{years prior to the}} events of the series, Marceline was born to a demon lord named Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson) and a human woman (voiced by Rebecca Sugar). Abadeer is the ruler of the Nightosphere—a Hell-like demon dimension—and subsists on the souls of sentient beings. For some reason, Marceline was left abandoned on Earth in events immediately following the Mushroom War, a mysterious war that ravaged the earth one thousand years prior to events of the series. During this time, Simon Petrikov—the name of the Ice King before he was overcome by the evil power of his crown—found Marceline in the ruins of a city and gave her a stuffed animal named Hambo to cheer her up. The two developed a caring relationship, although the crown took a toll on Simon's mental health, forcing him to leave Marceline alone. During this period in her life, she was reunited with her father, only to be disgusted by his cold and heartless ways. Although she attempted to tolerate his evil and selfish antics, she eventually severed all ties with Abadeer after she discovered him eating fries that she had made for herself. In the following years, Marceline roamed the land of Ooo and eventually befriended a tribe of humans. She became their guardian and ally, and she helped them kill vampires, who had taken over much of the land. Marceline soon discovered that, upon killing a vampire, she was able to acquire their unique abilities thanks to her demonic power to absorb souls. However, when she tried to fight the Vampire King himself, she was bitten. Although she eventually managed to slay him, she was turned in the process. At some point, she began a romantic relationship with a magician named Ash. The two would move into the Tree Fort, but their relationship would come to an end. Presumably, around this time, Marceline befriended Princess Bubblegum, the sovereign of the Candy Kingdom; the two would often avoid official royal meetings and explore the Candy Kingdom's elaborate rock candy mining complex. Eventually, due largely to the mounting stress of <b>running</b> <b>her</b> kingdom, Bubblegum pushed Marceline away, leaving an animosity between the two that lasted for a while.|$|E
25|$|After {{moving to}} Boston in 1959, {{she worked as}} a {{secretary}} for the Christian Science church and the Christian Science Monitor.

25|$|After {{her plan}} {{to blow up}} police {{headquarters}} narrowly failed, her stronghold was raided; Cutolo escaped under a rug in a car driven boldly past checkpoints by the neighbourhood priest.

In 1993 she gave herself up and only was charged with mafia association: prosecutors alleged she had been <b>running</b> <b>her</b> brother's organisation. She was acquitted 9 times of murder. Rosetta had persuaded the authorities she was harmless, and her frumpy image definitely helped.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the {{literary}} salon in the Arab world, of which little is known, dates back far longer than one would expect.

25|$|In 1519, Holbein {{moved back}} to Basel. His brother fades from the record at about this time, and it is usually presumed that he died. Holbein re-established himself rapidly in the city, running a busy workshop. He joined the painters' guild and took out Basel citizenship. He married Elsbeth Schmid, a widow {{a few years older}} than he was, who had an infant son, Franz, and was <b>running</b> <b>her</b> late husband's tanning business.

25|$|In series six, 1925, {{changes are}} once again afoot at Downton Abbey as the middle class rises and more bankrupted aristocrats are forced to sell off their large estates.

Lady Mary defies a blackmailer, who is thwarted by Lord Grantham. Lady Mary becomes the estate agent. Edith is more hands-on in <b>running</b> <b>her</b> magazine and hires a female editor. Lady Violet and Isobel once again draw battle lines as a government take-over of the local hospital is considered.|$|E
25|$|In Fleming's novels, many Bond {{girls have}} some sort of {{independent}} job or even career, often one that was considered inappropriate for women in the 1950s. Vesper Lynd, Gala Brand, Tatiana Romanova, Mary Ann Russell, and Mary Goodnight are in intelligence or law-enforcement work. Those who are criminals, such as Tiffany Case and Pussy Galore, tend to be similarly independent-minded in how they approach their work—the latter even <b>running</b> <b>her</b> own syndicate. Even those Bond girls who have more conventional or glamorous jobs show themselves to be invested in having an independent outlook on life. While the Bond girls are clearly intended as sex objects, they are nevertheless portrayed in the novels as having a high degree of independence; this is also frequently (but not always) the case in the films, especially from 1981 onward.|$|E
