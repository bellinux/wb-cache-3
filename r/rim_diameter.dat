40|$|Thousands of old mostly-circular {{structures}} with impact-compatible morphology, and <b>rim</b> <b>diameters</b> from 3 to 2500 km, saturate {{large tracts}} of both uplands and lowlands of Venus. Most of these old structures are ignored in conventional work, including that by Jurdy and Stoddard (this volume), and the small fraction that are considered at all are deemed endogenic and young. The well-preserved structures typically are circular-rimmed shallow basins with gentle debris aprons, often with gentle circular moats, and often with internal central peaks or peak rings. Basins are superimposed with the cookie-cutter bites required by impacts but incompatible with endogenic origins. Doublets and composite shapes attest to disruption of many bolides by gravity and dense atmosphere. Superpositions and analogy with the dated youngest large lunar impact basin indicate most of these structures to be older than 3. 85 Ga if they record impacts: the venusian landscape is relict from late-stage planetary accretion. See Hamilton (2005, this volume) for evidence, illustrations, and discussions.

40|$|The {{morphology}} {{of fresh}} lunar and Mercurian craters provides insight into processes of crater formation and modification. Measurements determined for Mercurian craters and compared to previously presented lunar data are depth/diameter, central peak and wall-related mass movement frequencies as functions of <b>diameter,</b> crater <b>rim</b> wall width/rim <b>diameter,</b> <b>rim</b> diameter/floor <b>diameter,</b> and central peak height/rim diameter. Two important results are as follows: (1) {{there is no}} evidence for direct gravity scaling of crater morphology, although some slight scaling relationship may be indicated, and (2) mass movements are responsible for the change in depth/diameter relationship observed near 2 -km depth and 10 -km diameter.

A simple, perfect plasticity model for terrace formation was proposed, but the preliminary terrace width measurements used to support the model were insufficient to provide a rigorous test. Lunar crater terraces were studied morphometrically. Roughly 1, 000 terraces in 53 fresh lunar craters were measured using Apollo and Lunar Orbiter vertical stereo photography.

2500|$|There are {{at least}} four {{different}} methods for measuring gear ratios: gear inches, metres of development (roll-out), gain ratio, and quoting the number of teeth {{on the front and}} rear sprockets respectively.

The fourth method uses two numbers and is only useful in comparing bicycles with the same drive wheel diameter. [...] In the case of road bikes, this is usually around 670mm.

The kiln sites are described and an outline of the typology that was developed to catalogue the ceramic assemblage is presented. A seriation of the assemblage demonstrates a relative chronology of the four sites that can be linked to an absolute chronology using external data. Using the range of types at each kiln site as a proxy for the intensity of production suggests a peak of production in the fifteenth to sixteenth century contemporary with the main phase of occupation at historic Julfar, and contemporary with the widest distribution of Julfar ware around the western Indian Ocean.
