25|$|To make hollandaise sauce, {{the eggs}} yolks are {{separated}} {{and added to}} a butter base with small amounts of water, vinegar or lemon juice with pepper, heated together slowly over a double boiler. A stainless steel bowl over a sauce pan {{with a small amount}} of water may also be used. The water should not touch the bowl or boil, just simmer. The key to the recipe is to heat the ingredients without curdling the egg. Add the egg and liquid ingredients first and whisk together with a wire whisk until frothy. Add the egg and liquid froth to the double boiler of the simmering water and whisk quickly and continuously. The mixture will expand a few times. <b>Remove</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source and begin adding warm, melted, clarified butter to the mixture. If the sauce cools too much the butter will begin to thicken. If this or separation begins to occur, a few drops of hot water can solve this issue.|$|E

40|$|Transportation Is Responsible For Approximately 20 Per Cent Of Global Greenhouse Gas Emissions Such As CO 2, Nox And HC Which Have Not Been Burned Completely In The Engine. In Particular, 55 Per Cent Of Globally Emitted Nox Which Is More Harmful To The Environment Than CO 2 Is Produced By The Automotive Industry Alone. Strict Emission Standards Are Now In Place That Set Specific Limits To The Amount Of Pollutants That Can Be Released Into The Environment. The Widely Used Measure To Reduce Nox Emissions In Diesel Engines Is To Return Part Of The Exhaust Gas To The Intake Of The Engine. This Is Usually Done Through Via A Heat Exchanger Known As Exhaust Gas Recirculation Cooler.

50|$|A common {{occurrence}} of water vapour bubbles is {{observed in a}} pan of boiling water. In that case the water pressure is not reduced, but rather, the vapour pressure of the water is increased by means of <b>heating.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source is sufficient, the bubbles will detach <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of the pan}} and rise to the surface as steam.

5000|$|Plastisol is {{used for}} slush molding or slush casting, a form of spin casting that {{is more complex than}} {{relatively}} simple resin casting, but less expensive and less sophisticated than the injection molding used for most plastic products. It involves metal molds that are filled with liquid plastisol. When the open mold cavities are filled, the mold is spun on a heavy duty, high speed centrifuge to force the liquid vinyl into all of the fine detail on the interior of the mold. Then the metal mold is placed into a heating solution, usually an industrial salt heated to about [...] The liquid vinyl cooks for a few seconds. The mold is then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> solution and <b>the</b> remaining liquid is poured out. This leaves a thin skin of vinyl on the interior of the metal mold. The mold is then placed back into <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> solution for three to four minutes to cure. After curing, the mold is again <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> solution, cooled with water, and placed on a rack. While the vinyl part is still warm in the mold, it is very flexible and can be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mold with pliers. When the parts cool, they become rigid and are ready for assembly.|$|R
50|$|After cooking paella, {{there is}} usually a layer of toasted rice {{at the bottom of}} the pan, called socarrat in Spain. This is {{considered}} a delicacy among Spaniards and is essential to a good paella. The toasted rice develops on its own if the paella is cooked over a burner or open fire. If cooked in an oven, however, it will not. To correct this, place the paellera over a high flame while listening to the rice toast {{at the bottom of the}} pan. Once the aroma of toasted rice wafts upwards, it is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat.</b> <b>The</b> paella must then sit for about five minutes (most recipes recommend the paella be covered with a tea-towel at this point) to absorb the remaining broth.|$|R

50|$|Placing {{the food}} in a water bath, with the {{temperature}} having been set at the desired final cooking temperature of the food, avoids overcooking, because the food cannot get hotter than the bath it is in, as in bain-marie. In conventional high-heat cooking, such as oven roasting or grilling, the food is exposed to heat levels that are {{much higher than the}} desired internal cooking temperature; the food must be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> high <b>heat</b> prior to its reaching the desired cooking temperature. If <b>the</b> food is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> too late, it becomes overcooked, and if it is removed too early, it is under-cooked. As a result of precise temperature control of the bath {{and the fact that the}} bath temperature is the same as the target cooking temperature, very precise control of cooking can be achieved. Additionally, temperature, and thus cooking, can be very even throughout {{the food in}} sous-vide cooking, even with irregularly shaped or very thick items, given enough time.|$|R
50|$|The {{juice is}} placed in a large bronze {{cauldron}} (called chartzin or kazani) and heated slowly. A small amount of a special white earth called asproi {{is added to the}} boiling must and causes impurities to rise to the surface, where they are collected and removed. It is possible to substitute asproi, when not available, with lager beer, which has a similar result. Once the cleansing process is complete, the liquid is left to cool. Next, flour is added while stirring and <b>heating</b> <b>the</b> mixture. When it reaches the right consistency, based on the rate of steam bubbles and the viscosity of the mixture, it is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat.</b> <b>The</b> mix, called palouzes, is now ready for use in {{the next step in the}} process of making soutzoukos, which consists of preparing the nuts for dipping.|$|R

30|$|The extract {{was made}} using 20  g of fresh leaves. Prior to extract preparation, the plant leaves were cleaned {{thoroughly}} using deionized {{water and then}} cut into small pieces. The plant extract sample was then added into 125  ml of boiling deionized water, and left to boil for 3  min. The solution was then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source and left to cool to ambient temperature (approximately 25  °C). The extract was then filtered through a coarse sieve to remove any leaf matter and the resultant filtrate was then refrigerated. The Plant extract was collected and stored at 4  °C. Finally, the extract {{was used for the}} synthesis of AgNPs [11].|$|R
50|$|Miso {{typically}} {{comes as}} a paste in a sealed container requiring refrigeration after opening. Natural miso is a living food containing many beneficial microorganisms such as Tetragenococcus halophilus which can be killed by overcooking. For this reason, the miso should be added to soups or other foods being prepared just before they are <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat.</b> Using miso without any cooking may be even better. Outside Japan, a popular practice is to only add miso to foods that have cooled to preserve kōjikin cultures in miso. Nonetheless, miso and soy foods play {{a large role in}} the Japanese diet, and many cooked miso dishes are popular.|$|R
50|$|Turkish coffee (aka Arabic coffee, etc.), a {{very early}} method of making coffee, {{is used in the}} Middle East, North Africa, East Africa, Turkey, Greece, the Balkans, and Russia. Very finely ground coffee, {{optionally}} sugar, and water are placed in a narrow-topped pot, called an cezve (Turkish), kanaka (Egyptian), briki (Greek), džezva (Štokavian) or turka (Russian) and brought to the boil then immediately <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat.</b> It may be very briefly brought to the boil two or three times. Turkish coffee is sometimes flavored with cardamom, particularly in Arab countries. The resulting strong coffee, with foam on the top and a thick layer of grounds at the bottom, is drunk from small cups.|$|R
50|$|The most popular, but {{probably}} the least accurate, method {{of determining the}} degree of roast is to judge the bean's color by eye (the exception to this is using a spectrophotometer to measure the ground coffee reflectance under infrared light and comparing it to standards such as the Agtron scale). As <b>the</b> coffee absorbs <b>heat,</b> <b>the</b> color shifts to yellow and then to increasingly darker shades of brown. During the later stages of roasting, oils appear {{on the surface of}} the bean. The roast will continue to darken until it is <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> source. Coffee also darkens as it ages, making color alone a poor roast determinant. Most roasters use a combination of temperature, smell, color, and sound to monitor the roasting process.|$|R
40|$|A {{temperature}} compensation element for a high-temperature strain gage and {{the method of}} fabricating the same. Preferably, the element is a "dummy" strain gage not mechanically attached to the substrate. The element is encapsulated in an insulative material and used to compensate an active high-temperature strain gage and wired in a half-bridge configuration. The {{temperature compensation}} element and high-temperature strain gage are fabricated using the method of the present invention. This method includes temporarily adhering the element to a heat sink, encapsulated in an insulative material and then <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> sink. Next, <b>the</b> element is either stacked or placed near the active gage. Ideally, the element and the active gage have substantially similar heat transfer and electrical properties...|$|R
50|$|Pork chops are {{suitable}} for roasting, grilling, or frying, {{but there are also}} stuffed pork chop recipes. They can be used boneless or bone-in. Pork chops are usually cut between 1/2 inch and 2 inches thick. Improved breeding techniques for hogs have made it possible to cook pork to a lower temperature, helping the meat to remain juicy, while still being safe to eat. Guidelines have recently been refined to recommend the safe internal pork cooking temperature for pork chops to 145° F. In order to ensure the chop is properly cooked, a digital thermometer should be used to measure the chop at its thickest part avoiding the bone. Once the chop reaches the recommended internal temperature, it can be <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> to rest for approximately three minutes.|$|R
