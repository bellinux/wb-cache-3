5000|$|... "White trash" [...] is a {{derogatory}} American English <b>racial</b> <b>slur</b> {{referring to}} poor white people, {{especially in the}} rural southern United States. The label signifies lower social class inside the white population and especially a degraded standard of living.

At court martial, 32 {{were found guilty}} of various crimes including mutiny, seizing arms, rioting, and firing upon officers and MPs.

Eaker, commander of the Eighth Air Force, placed {{the majority of the}} blame on the white officers and MPs and to prevent such an incident happening again, he combined the black trucking units into a single special command. The ranks of this command were purged of inexperienced and racist officers, and the MP patrols were racially integrated. Morale among black troops stationed in England improved, and the rates of courts-martial and venereal disease both fell, although there were several more minor conflicts between black and white American troops in Britain during the war.|$|E
25|$|Building {{on their}} late-season pennant run in 1963, the 1964 Cardinals {{developed}} a strong camaraderie that was noted for being {{free of the}} racial tension that predominated in the United States at that time. Part of this atmosphere stemmed from {{the integration of the}} team's spring training hotel in 1960, and Gibson and teammate Bill White worked to confront and stop use of <b>racial</b> <b>slurs</b> within the team. On August 23, the Cardinals were 11 games behind the Philadelphia Phillies and remained six-and-a-half games behind on September 21. The combination of a nine-game Cardinals winning streak and a ten-game Phillies losing streak then brought the season down to the final game. The Cardinals faced the New York Mets, and Gibson entered the game as a relief pitcher in the fifth inning. Aware that the Phillies were ahead of the Cincinnati Reds 4–0 at the time he entered the game, Gibson proceeded to pitch four innings of two-hit relief, while his teammates scored 11 runs of support to earn the victory.|$|E

The event startled the Israel Football Association which never had racism between players {{on the field and}} had no punishment system in place for it.

Zohar rejoined Beitar, where he was a central part of the club and helped steer the club away from the relegation zone of the table.
