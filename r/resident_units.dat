5|$|Excavation {{evidence}} {{from all the}} imperial borders which suggests that late forts were designed to accommodate much smaller garrisons than their predecessors from the Principate. Where such sites can be identified with forts listed in the Notitia, {{the implication is that}} the <b>resident</b> <b>units</b> were also smaller. Examples include the Legio II Herculia, created by Diocletian, which occupied a fort just one-seventh the size of a typical Principate legionary base, implying a strength of c. 750 men. At Abusina on the Danube, the Cohors III Brittonum was housed in a fort only 10% the size of its old Trajanic fort, suggesting that it numbered only around 50 men. The evidence must be treated with caution as identification of archaeological sites with placenames in the Notitia is often tentative and again, the units in question may be detachments (the Notitia frequently shows the same unit in two or three different locations simultaneously). Nevertheless, the weight of the archaeological evidence favours small sizes for frontier units. Archaeological evidence suggests that the army in Britain in ca. 400 just one-third its size in 200 (17,500 effectives versus 55,000).|$|E

5000|$|GNI {{is defined}} in {{accordance}} with the European system of national and regional accounts. GNI represents total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (interest, dividends and reinvested earnings from foreign direct investment receivable less payable), gross operating surplus and gross mixed income. It corresponds to the better known gross domestic product (GDP) minus primary income payable by <b>resident</b> <b>units</b> to non-resident units, plus primary income receivable by <b>resident</b> <b>units</b> {{from the rest of the}} world. Technically speaking, the GNI is a balancing item of the allocation of primary income account in the sequence of accounts for the total economy. Loosely speaking, it is the sum of domestic and foreign income earned by the resident population of a country. It is worth noting that GNI is income from productive activities excluding any capital gains and losses (also known as [...] "holding gains and losses") resulting from price changes of fixed or financial assets (for example: price changes on the stock market have no direct impact on GNI).|$|E

40|$|Residence in a {{currency}} union and residence {{in a single}} economy 1. Being a resident of a country member of {{a currency}} union necessarily implies being a resident of this currency union. The question is asked {{as to whether the}} reverse is true, i. e. does being a <b>resident</b> <b>unit</b> of a currency union imply being a <b>resident</b> <b>unit</b> of at least one member country of the union? In other words, can the existence of a currency union create a residence status additional to the residence status of the component economies of the currency union? 2. In the first place, this paper discusses the issue of the residence status of a currency union central bank (CUCB) in a currency union. This paper also discusses the case of multiterritory enterprise, 1 for which the centre of economic interest is not clearly established and, in some cases, more closely related to the union as a whole than to any individual country.

50|$|The extra-regio {{territory}} {{is made up}} of parts of the economic territory of a country which cannot be assigned to a single region. It consists of the national air-space, territorial waters and the continental shelf lying in international waters over which the country enjoys exclusive rights, territorial exclaves, deposits of oil, natural gas etc. worked by <b>resident</b> <b>units.</b> Until 2011, the gross value added (GVA) produced in the extra-regio was allocated pro-rata to the inhabited regions of the country concerned. The order of magnitude of the extra-regio GVA depends in particular on the resource endowment in terms of natural gas and oil. In 2011, Member States and the European Commission agreed to give countries the possibility to calculate regional GDP also for the extra-regio. The resulting GDP is available only in absolute values, because the extra-regio territory by definition does not have a resident population.|$|E
5000|$|... 2. Allocation {{of primary}} income account -This account shows the <b>resident</b> <b>units</b> and {{institutional}} sectors as recipients rather than producers of primary income.

Also recorded in this account is the property income received by an owner of a financial asset in return for providing funds to, or putting a tangible non-produced asset at the disposal of, another unit. The receipt by government of taxes on production less subsidies is shown in resources.The resources side of this account includes the components of the income approach to measuring gross domestic product and is the starting point for the quarterly sector accounts. The accounts also include property income recorded as both resources for receipts and uses for payments.The balance of this account is the gross balance of primary income for each sector. If the gross balance of primary income is aggregated across all sectors of the UK economy, the result is gross national income.|$|E

Examples include the Legio II Herculia, created by Diocletian, which occupied a fortress only 1/7 of the size of a typical legionary fort of the Principate, suggesting a unit of around 750 soldiers. At Abusina on the Rhine, the Cohors III Brittonum resided in a fort only a tenth the size of its old fort in the time of Trajan, suggesting that the cohort contained a mere 50 soldiers. This evidence must be used with caution insofar as the identifications of archaeological sites with the locations in the Notitia Dignatorum is often uncertain and also because the units in question could be detachments (The Notitia frequently mentions the same units in two or three different locations at the same time). Even so, the results of the excavations seem to suggest tiny dimensions for the units of the frontiers.|$|E

40|$|The new {{residential}} property price in Hong Kong has rocketed {{in the last}} decade and has ranked within the top three metropolitan cities in the world. Housing is a necessity for most people, high {{residential property}} price has its social ramification. The rocketing price seems not solely the result of the market. As such, this raised the issue of competition in this market. This study employs Concentration Ratio and Hirfindahl-Hirschman index to evaluate the market concentration of the New Private <b>Resident</b> <b>Units</b> Market in Hong Kong. Using the best information available in the public domains and applying universal thresholds, the New Private <b>Resident</b> <b>Units</b> Market in Hong Kong is considered moderately concentrated. It is noted that the big five listed developers in Hong Kong are collectively holding a dominant position of the potential supply. Moreover, the top three have comparable market shares thus suggesting no monopoly exists. It is also found that the substantial land banks held by the five big listed developers, amount to 60 % of that owned by the Government. These developers will therefore retain their dominant market power in the future. Further study is recommended to examine whether the big developers have abused their market power...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: This {{discussion}} paper {{responds to the}} growing demand for environmental expenditure information identified within environmental domains. The ABS has previously produced Environmental Protection Expenditure statistics, Environment Protection, Mining and Manufacturing Industries, Australia, 2000 - 01 (cat. no. 4603. 0) and Environment Expenditure, Local Government, Australia, 2002 - 03 (cat. no. 4611. 0). However, a scarcity of available information and data priorities which focussed on other areas, such as water and energy environmental-economic accounts, has meant that regular environmental expenditure accounts have not been produced. The tables contained in this {{discussion paper}} {{are based on the}} United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) Central Framework for expenditure on environmental protection and natural resource management. The SEEA is an international statistical standard that the ABS uses to produce a range of environmental-economic accounts including the ABS Water Account, Australia (cat. no. 4610. 0) and the ABS Energy Account, Australia (cat. no. 4604. 0). More information about the ABS environmental-economic accounts programme and its relationship to the SEEA {{can be found in the}} ABS Information Paper: Towards the Australian Environmental-Economic Accounts, 2013 (cat. no. 4655. 0. 55. 002). Establishing accounts for environmental expenditure would identify and measure society’s response to environmental concerns through the supply and demand for environmental protection services and through the adoption of production and consumption behaviour aimed at preventing environmental degradation. An Environmental Expenditure Account (EEA) would provide information on the value of environmental protection specific services produced across the economy and on the expenditure of <b>resident</b> <b>units</b> on all services for environmental protection and natural resource management purposes. As a first step, the ABS is seeking feedback on this discussion paper from stakeholders on how an EEA might be used by policy and research agencies and on any technical issues where readers have expertise. Feedback is also sought on the identification and accessibility of appropriate information and data sources for the account...|$|E
