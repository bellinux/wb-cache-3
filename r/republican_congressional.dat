5|$|In February 2017, Keating {{was named}} by the National <b>Republican</b> <b>Congressional</b> Committee as one of 36 top Democratic targets for the 2018 {{election}}s. The hope of Republicans is to gain seats in the mid-term election by challenging in blue-collar parts of the country.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 {{version of}} the Roadmap found only 14 cosponsors. On August 31, 2010, the National <b>Republican</b> <b>Congressional</b> Committee {{requested}} members not to defend the Roadmap, noting its proposal to privatize social security.|$|E
5|$|By May 1997, <b>Republican</b> <b>congressional</b> leaders {{reached a}} {{compromise}} with Democrats and President Clinton {{on the federal}} budget. The agreement called for a federal spending plan designed to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget by 2002. The plan included a total of $152billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years. Other major parts of the spending plan called for $115billion to be saved through a restructuring of Medicare, $24billion set aside to extend health insurance to children of the working poor, tax credits for college tuition, and a $2billion welfare-to-work jobs initiative.|$|E

2500|$|Romney {{opposed the}} Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, the {{compromise}} tax package between President Obama and the <b>Republicans</b> <b>Congressional</b> leadership that centered around a two-year {{extension of the}} Bush tax cuts. He said, [...] "because the extension is only temporary, {{a large portion of}} the investment and job growth that characteristically accompanies low taxes will be lost. [...] It will also add to the deficit." ...|$|R

5|$|Prior to {{the presidential}} {{election}} of 1868, Wilson toured the South giving political speeches. Many in the press believed Wilson was promoting himself to be the Republican presidential candidate. Wilson, however, supported the Civil War hero General Ulysses S. Grant. During Reconstruction Grant supported <b>Republican</b> <b>Congressional</b> initiatives rather than President Johnson's, and during the dispute over the Tenure of Office Act which led to Johnson's impeachment, Grant served as temporary Secretary of War, but then returned the Department to Radical ally Edwin M. Stanton's control over Johnson's strong objection, making Grant a favorite to many Radicals.|$|E
5|$|Each {{candidate}} {{aimed to}} discredit the other by pointing out his opponent's flaws or mistakes. Republicans called attention to Murphy's failure {{to pay taxes on}} a start-up computer software company he had founded in the 1990s, drawing comparison to three high-profile Obama administration nominees who failed to pay all of their taxes. Tedisco also called attention to Murphy's failure to regularly vote in elections after the National <b>Republican</b> <b>Congressional</b> Committee (NRCC) announced that Murphy had failed to vote in the 2000 presidential election, along with seven other primaries and general elections between 2000 and 2003. Believing the negative ads run by the NRCC were responsible for his drop in the polls, Tedisco announced that he would take control of campaign advertising from the NRCC.|$|E
5|$|Mathias' {{candidacy}} consideration did not endear him to {{the conservative}} wing of the Maryland Republican Party organization. In June 1976, he lost a vote by state Republicans to determine who would represent Maryland on the platform committee at the 1976 Republican National Convention. Instead, the group chose George Price, a conservative member of the Maryland House of Delegates from Baltimore County. At one point, Mathias was close to being denied attendance to the convention altogether as an at-large delegate, but a last minute compromise ensured all <b>Republican</b> <b>congressional</b> representatives seats as at-large delegates. Mathias maintained a low profile during the convention, and received harsh criticism {{from some of the}} conservative delegates from Maryland who attended.|$|E

25|$|New York <b>Republican</b> <b>Congressional</b> {{candidate}} George Demos also objected.

25|$|The Republican House and Senate caucuses have {{separate}} fundraising and strategy committees. The National <b>Republican</b> <b>Congressional</b> Committee (NRCC) assists in House races, while the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) {{does so in}} Senate races.
