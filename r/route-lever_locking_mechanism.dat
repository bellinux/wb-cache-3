40|$|Abstract. Concurrency control {{mechanisms}} such as turn-taking, locking, serialization, transactional <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism,</b> {{and operational}} transformation {{try to provide}} data consistency when concurrent activities are permitted in a reactive system. Locks are typically used in transactional models for assurance of data consistency and integrity in a concurrent environment. In addition, recovery management is used to preserve atomicity and durability in transaction models. Unfortunately, conventional <b>lock</b> <b>mechanisms</b> severely (and intentionally) limit concurrency in a transactional environment. Such <b>lock</b> <b>mechanisms</b> also limit recovery capabilities. Finally, existing recovery mechanisms themselves afford a considerable overhead to concurrency. This paper describes a new transaction model that supports release of early results {{inside and outside of}} a transaction, decreasing the severe limitations of conventional <b>lock</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> yet still warranties consistency and recoverability of released resources (results). This is achieved through use of a more flexible <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> and by using two types of consistency graph. This provides an integrated solution for transaction management, recovery management and concurrency control. We argue that these are necessary features for management of long-term transactions within “digital ecosystems ” of small to medium enterprise...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} a <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> designed by ProTeqt Technologies. More specifically, the analysis considers the mechanism after {{the implementation of a}} resonantly coupled circuit used to receive and transmit wireless energy. Ultimately, the wireless energy is used to generate heat, which in turn causes a polymeric material to expand, thereby creating a mechanical force to disengage the <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The analysis considers the force generated through wireless transmission, as well as the forces required to disengage the <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The general physics of wireless energy transmission through resonant coupling is presented, as well as design specifications and manufacturing techniques used to produce the secondary circuit. Force requirements and design specifications that drive the success of the <b>locking</b> <b>mechanism</b> are then discussed before the presentation of coinciding results. by Mitchell S. Krogman.
