40|$|Organisational {{justice has}} been of great {{interest}} to researchers as it has been linked to employee attitudes and behaviours (Dailey & Kirk, 1992; Greenberg, 1990; Moorman, 1991). However in the context of South African organisations, <b>restorative</b> organisational <b>justice,</b> Ramsay (2009) argues, should occupy a similar place of interest. This is because South African organisations are governed by social correction policies such as employment equity which aims at correcting past injustices in the work place. This has resulted in the preferential selection of previously disadvantaged groups. The current research study attempted to understand the relationship between organisational justice and organisational attractiveness as well as the relationship between <b>restorative</b> organisational <b>justice</b> and organisational attractiveness. Furthermore the research attempted to explore {{whether or not there was}} a difference in degree of association between these two organisational justice frameworks and their relationship with organisational attractiveness. The research was conducted on a sample of 342 employees from a debt collection organisation. Only the call centre department within the organisation participated. The results further confirmed the strong relationship between organisational justice and organisational attractiveness. Surprisingly <b>restorative</b> organisational <b>justice</b> overall, did not prove to have as strong a relationship with organisational attractiveness as compared to the traditional organisational justice framework. Research should not end here and future research should attempt to explore restorative organisational perceptions using different samples with a more diverse representation of race...|$|R

25|$|The September 23 {{agreement}} on transitional justice {{was considered the}} most important moment {{in the peace process}} to date, because it resolved one of the most complicated issues through a formula satisfactory to both the guerrilla and the government, combining <b>restorative</b> <b>justice</b> with alternative sentences for guerrillas and agents of the State who have committeed crimes against humanity with amnesty for those responsible of political crimes.

Much of this discourse focuses on questions of the functional choices: <b>restorative</b> or retributive <b>justice.</b> A “restorative” approach to justice focuses on the idea of reconciliation while the “retributive” approach focuses on the punishment of perpetrators. The idea of truth telling, which encompasses truth commissions and historical memory, is most closely connected to a <b>restorative</b> approach to <b>justice,</b> although seeking the truth is also an implicit and explicit goal of criminal courts which serve a primarily retributive function...|$|R

25|$|The {{item was}} one of the most {{complicated}} for the two parties to find an agreement on. The FARC, which claimed that it's insurgency was justified and that they it was not militarily defeated, initially refused to submit to the laws and institutions of a political system which it opposed. On the other hand, the government had the obligation to design a transitional justice system which would be satisfactory to the FARC (who sought <b>restorative</b> <b>justice)</b> but also in keeping with Colombia's international treaty obligations, notably the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. Complicating issues further, both the FARC and the government have historically refused to admit responsibility for crimes they have committed, with the guerrilla considering itself a victim of State oppression and the Colombian government considering itself to be the leader and defender of a democratic society.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{ineffectiveness}} of prisons at preventing crime, the high costs of maintaining them, and the detrimental socio-economic effects of mass incarceration, many nations (e.g. Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands) have been working towards policies of large-scale decarceration, addressing crime and violence with alternative strategies such as fines, community service, and <b>restorative</b> <b>justice</b> processes. In addition to moving towards a more wholistic style of punishment, Nordic Countries in particular are focusing their efforts on prevention. In Sweden local police now work with county government to target at-risk youths. Swedish children from dysfunctional homes are provided more education and after-school activities to try and keep them out of trouble. In addition, police in Nordic countries are less likely to arrest youth for minor violations of the law. If a teenager steals food from a grocery store, they are often given community service time.|$|E

In their article, Karp and Drakulich have added a further important layer to our comprehension of the possibilities and pitfalls in implementing particular models of <b>justice</b> informed by <b>restorative</b> ideals. In what follows, I want to reflect on a fundamental, but often unasked, public policy question raised by the Vermont Reparative Boards and the thoughtful evaluation of them provided by Karp and Drakulich; namely; why involve lay people in criminal/restorative justice interventions?

Scholar Marek Oziewicz identified the story as critiquing the notion of retributive justice, considered the norm in Western societies, and instead supporting the idea of <b>restorative</b> <b>justice.</b> The protagonists of Voices succeed in [...] "making things right" [...] without punitive action. According to Oziewicz, the central question of the story is one that Memer asks the Oracle: [...] "How can we be free of the Alds?" [...] The answer is not a bloody revolution, but a compromise, possible because both parties are willing to recognize and end the conflict. Desac symbolizes the idea of retributive action, which is more emotionally satisfying but ultimately unsuccessful, while Orrec offers the more difficult, but successful method.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} feminist restorative model of environmental justice {{that addresses the}} injustices found within UNICOR’s e-waste recycling operations. A feminist <b>restorative</b> environmental <b>justice</b> challenges the presupposition that grassroots efforts, law and policy, medical and scientific research, and theoretical pursuits (alone or in conjunction) are sufficient to address the emotional and relational harm of environmental injustices. To eliminate environmental harms, this model uses collaborative dialogue for interested parties to prevent environmental harm. To encourage participation, a feminist restorative model accepts many forms of knowledge and truth as ‘legitimate’ and offers an opportunity for women to share how their personal experiences of love, violence, and caring differ from men and other women and connect to larger social practices. This method of environmental justice offers opportunities for repair, reparation and reintegration that can transform perspectives on criminality, dangerous practices and structures in the PIC, and all persons who share in a restorative encounter...|$|R
