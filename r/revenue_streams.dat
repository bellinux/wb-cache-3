5|$|To {{service clients}} without {{ready access to}} {{low-cost}} financing, the IFC relies on structured or securitized financial products such as partial credit guarantees, portfolio risk transfers, and Islamic finance. The IFC committed $797 million {{in the form of}} structured and securitized financing in 2010. For companies that face difficulty in obtaining financing due to a perception of high credit risk, the IFC securitizes assets with predictable cash flows, such as mortgages, credit cards, loans, corporate debt instruments, and <b>revenue</b> <b>streams,</b> in an effort to enhance those companies' credit.|$|E
5|$|Films {{generate}} {{income from}} several <b>revenue</b> <b>streams,</b> including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising. However, theatrical box office earnings {{are the primary}} metric for trade publications in assessing {{the success of a}} film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.|$|E
5|$|The top 10% paid 51.8% {{of total}} federal taxes in 2009, {{and the top}} 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax {{national}} income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes. In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile. The incidence of corporate income tax has {{been a matter of}} considerable ongoing controversy for decades. State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne regressive sales and property taxes that yield less volatile <b>revenue</b> <b>streams,</b> though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.|$|E

5|$|Undismayed by {{the loss}} of his papers, Bottomley {{embarked}} on an ambitious expansion scheme. On the basis of a lucrative contract to print the Hansard reports of debates in the Westminster parliament, at the beginning of 1889 he founded the Hansard Publishing Union Limited, floated on the London Stock Exchange with a capital of £500,000. Bottomley boosted the company's credentials by persuading several notable City figures to join the company's board of directors. These included Sir Henry Isaacs, the Lord Mayor-elect of London, Coleridge Kennard, co-founder (with Harry Marks) of the London Evening News, and Sir Roper Lethbridge, the Conservative MP for Kensington North. This board approved the purchase by Bottomley of several printing businesses—he used intermediaries to disguise his considerable personal profits from these transactions. He also persuaded the board to give him £75,000 as a down payment for some publishing firms in Austria for which he was negotiating, although the firms were not acquired. These outgoings and other expenses absorbed the Union's capital, and with few significant <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> it quickly ran out of money. Nonetheless, without any statement of accounts, in July 1890 Bottomley announced a profit for the year of £40,877, and declared a dividend of eight per cent.|$|E

25|$|Venture {{capital is}} a broad {{subcategory}} of private equity that refers to equity investments made, typically in less mature companies, for the launch of a seed or start-up company, early stage development, or expansion of a business.

25|$|Good yield {{management}} maximizes (or at least significantly increases) revenue production {{for the same}} number of units, by taking advantage of the forecast of high demand/low demand periods, effectively shifting demand from high demand periods to low demand periods and by charging a premium for late bookings.

25|$|In January 2006, Sheffield United {{became the}} first foreign club {{to take over a}} Chinese team when they {{purchased}} the football club Chengdu Wuniu, based in the city of Chengdu, China. The club was renamed the Chengdu Blades, after their new owners. Sheffield United shirts were sold in China, and Chengdu shirts were sold in Sheffield, increasing <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> for both clubs. United sold on their share of the Chinese side in 2010, following Chengdu's implication in a match-fixing scandal and increasing financial pressures on the English club.|$|E
25|$|In {{industries}} where assets can be securitized effectively {{because they}} reliably generate future <b>revenue</b> <b>streams</b> {{or have a}} good potential for resale in case of foreclosure, businesses may more cheaply {{be able to raise}} debt to finance their growth. Good examples would include asset-intensive extractive industries such as mining, or manufacturing industries. Offshore funding is provided via specialist venture capital trusts, which seek to use securitization in structuring hybrid multi-market transactions via an SPV (special purpose vehicle): a corporate entity that is designed solely for the purpose of the financing.|$|E
