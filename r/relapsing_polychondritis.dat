25|$|Genetic {{influence}}s: The {{influence of}} genetic factors is high. AAA is {{four to six}} times more common in male siblings of known patients, with a risk of 20-30%. The high familial prevalence rate is most notable in male individuals. There are many hypotheses about the exact genetic disorder that could cause higher incidence of AAA among male members of the affected families. Some presumed that the influence of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency could be crucial, while other experimental works favored the hypothesis of X-linked mutation, which would explain the lower incidence in heterozygous females. Other hypotheses of genetic causes have also been formulated. Connective tissue disorders, such as Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, have also been strongly associated with AAA. Both <b>relapsing</b> <b>polychondritis</b> and pseudoxanthoma elasticum may cause abdominal aortic aneurysm.|$|E

500|$|Behçet's {{disease is}} a triad of mouth ulcers, genital ulcers and {{anterior}} uveitis. The main feature of Behçet's {{disease is a}}phthous-like ulceration, but this is usually more severe than seen in aphthous stomatitis without a systemic cause, and typically resembles major or herpetiforme ulceration or both. Aphthous-like ulceration is {{the first sign of}} the disease in 25–75% of cases. [...] Behçet's is more common in individuals whose ethnic origin is from regions along the Silk Road (between the Mediterranean and the Far East). It tends to be rare in other countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. MAGIC syndrome is a possible variant of Behçet disease, and is associated with aphthous-like ulceration. The name stands for [...] "mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage" [...] (<b>relapsing</b> <b>polychondritis).</b>|$|E
