25|$|Air Ambulance {{operates}} both a 24-hour {{emergency service}} and a <b>routine</b> <b>service.</b> The clinical condition of a patient determines if the transfer is on an urgent or routine basis. An urgent response is provided for patients who require immediate transport, for the clinical management of, for example, multiple trauma, labour complications, acute cardiac cases. A routine response is provided for those patients who are stable and are scheduled for the next routine or elective flight to the area or receiving hospital.|$|E
25|$|Apart from <b>routine</b> <b>service</b> in Australian and {{regional}} waters, {{a number of}} vessels were deployed to the Solomon Islands {{as part of the}} Australian-led RAMSI peacekeeping mission there. Operating as part of Operation Anode from 2003, vessels deployed have included Hawkesbury, Diamantina, Yarra and Gascoyne. As of 2008, Huon and Hawkesbury were taking turns supporting border security operations. However, by October 2011 Hawkesbury and Norman were placed into reserve; the Department of Defence predicted that it would take five years to bring both back to operational status and train enough personnel to run all six vessels.|$|E
40|$|A {{national}} household coverage {{survey of}} 3697 Ecuadorean children, {{carried out in}} July 1986, provided {{an opportunity for a}} cost-effectiveness analysis of (1) <b>routine</b> vaccination <b>services</b> based in fixed facilities and (2) mass immunization campaigns. A major purpose of the campaigns was to complement the <b>routine</b> <b>services</b> and to accelerate immunization activities. Based on the coverage survey, the Program for Reduction of Maternal and Childhood Illness (PREMI) and earlier campaigns increased the proportion of children under 5 years who were fully vaccinated from 43 % to 64 %. In one year, the PREMI campaign was responsible for fully vaccinating 11 % of children under one year, 21 % of 1 - 2 -year-old children, and 13 % of all children under 5 years. The campaign also helped ensure that vaccinations were completed when children were still very young and at greatest risk. The average cost per vaccination dose (in 1985 US$ prices) was approximately $ 0. 29 for fixed facilities and $ 0. 83 for the PREMI campaign. Total national costs were $ 675, 000 and $ 1, 665, 000 for <b>routine</b> and campaign <b>services</b> respectively. The cost per fully vaccinated child (FVC) was $ 4. 39 for <b>routine</b> vaccination <b>services</b> and $ 8. 60 for the campaign. The cost per death averted was about $ 1900 for <b>routine</b> vaccination <b>services,</b> $ 4200 for the PREMI campaign, and $ 3200 for the combined programme. Because of Ecuador's lower mortality rates, the costs per death averted in Ecuador from both vaccination strategies are not as low as those from studies of vaccinations in Africa. The campaigns, though less cost-effective than <b>routine</b> <b>services,</b> significantly improved the vaccination coverage of younger children who had been missed by the <b>routine</b> <b>services.</b> The costs per FVC of both the campaign and the <b>routine</b> <b>services</b> compare favourably with such programmes in other countries...|$|R

500|$|The NTSB {{determined}} that {{the damage to the}} left wing engine pylon had occurred during an earlier engine change at the American Airlines aircraft maintenance facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on March 29 and 30, 1979. On that date the aircraft had undergone <b>routine</b> <b>service,</b> during which the engine and pylon had been removed from the wing for inspection and maintenance. [...] The removal procedure recommended by McDonnell-Douglas called for the engine to be detached from the pylon before detaching the pylon itself from the wing. [...] However, American Airlines, as well as Continental Airlines and United Airlines, had developed a different procedure that saved approximately 200 man-hours per aircraft and [...] "more importantly from a safety standpoint, it would reduce the number of disconnects (of systems such as hydraulic and fuel lines, electrical cables, and wiring) from 72 to 27." [...] This new procedure involved removal of the engine and pylon assembly as a single unit, rather than as individual components. United Airline's implementation involved use of an overhead hoist to support the engine/pylon assembly during removal and installation. [...] The method chosen by American and Continental procedure supported the engine/pylon assembly with a large forklift.|$|E
