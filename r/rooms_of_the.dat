5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, over 100 western {{movies were}} filmed in nearby Sedona and Oak Creek Canyon. The Hotel Monte Vista in Flagstaff hosted many film stars during this era, {{including}} Jane Russell, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, John Wayne, and Bing Crosby. A {{scene from the}} movie Casablanca was filmed {{in one of the}} <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotel.|$|E
5|$|The Palace of Frets {{is located}} on the fourth terrace of the Acropolis. The south facade of the palace is {{decorated}} with four large stepped frets. On {{the east side of the}} palace a stairway leads to a decorated throne of stone and stucco.

5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} {{has also}} been used in other styles of architecture. For instance, Leonardo da Vinci sketched this shape as the plan for a fortification. A modern high-rise building, the Kölntriangle in Cologne, Germany, was built with a Reuleaux triangle cross-section. Together with the circular shape of its core, this gives varied depths to the <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building.|$|E
5|$|All five {{floors are}} {{connected}} by a central scale-and-platt staircase, added in the early 17th century to replace a turnpike stair in the south-west. The <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper floors have impressive panelling and decorated ceilings. The main hall, in the south part of the block, has been divided, but retains a large fireplace with the carved initials WS and JE, for William Sinclair and his wife Jean Edmonstone, and the date 1597.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012 {{the ground}} and top floors of the main house, {{together}} with the adjacent wings, are used as accommodation for the elderly. The reception <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first floor {{are open to the}} public at advertised times, and are entered by the original stairway on the south front; they contain paintings and furniture collected by the Leicester family. Some items in the collection had formerly been displayed on this floor, whilst others were moved from elsewhere in the house. The first floor may also be hired for weddings, meetings, and conferences. It is managed by a trust, which is supported by a group of Friends and by volunteers.|$|E

5|$|Crash noted how Knight Lore masking {{technique}} addressed issues of flicker and attribute clash, and Sinclair User appreciated how Sabreman disappeared from view when passing behind blocks. In criticism, reviewers considered Knight Lore sound {{to be its}} weakest component, though Your Spectrum and Clash also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle require pixel-perfect precision, compounded by the anxiety of the running timer, and the game's animations would slow down proportional {{to the degree of}} onscreen action.|$|E
5|$|During {{the liberation}} of Manila {{buildings}} of the University in Intramuros, {{as well as in}} Sampaloc were damaged or destroyed. The facility in Intramuros was burned on February 8, 1944. As for those in Sampaloc, though they were not destroyed, some portions were slightly damaged during the shellings, including the rooms on the West of the Main Building, some <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Education building, and the University gymnasium.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the female}} {{claim to the}} {{principal}} <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corps de logis, the library and dining room were relocated to a secondary wing not built until much later. This secondary wing {{is linked to the}} west of corps de logis by a large arcaded loggia; originally open, it is now glazed and known as the Winter Garden. A later secondary wing, known as the Shuvalov wing (named after Vorontsov's son-in-law, Count Shuvalov) was not part of Blore's original plan and designed by his assistant, William Hunt.|$|E

5|$|The 200 guest <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} hotel {{were divided}} into four two-story motel wings, each with fifty rooms, and named after famous race tracks. They were set out in a hacienda style, and surrounded by a half-moon shaped pool. The suites were luxuriously designed. Plush blue carpets and ivory colored chairs with white ceilings were the norm in the early days. An electric tram service, often attended by pretty showgirls, took the guests to their rooms. A 14-story tower commenced construction in late 1965, and was opened in 1967. It existed until November 1996 when it was demolished.|$|E
5|$|The Sala das Mangas (the only room in {{the state}} apartments to fully survive the 1934 fire) is a long gallery lined with tiled wall panels (illustrated below). The gallery leads to the enfilade of state rooms, {{all of which have}} been fully restored. The formal <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> palace consist of three large halls: The Hall of Ambassadors, The Music Room and the Ball Room. Other smaller rooms include the Gun Room (where hunting parties would assemble), which is a frescoed salon painted with trees and foliage by Pillement.|$|E
5|$|The Scarborough School {{was founded}} in 1913 by Frank and Narcissa Vanderlip for their six {{children}} {{and the children of}} friends and neighbors. Having met educator Maria Montessori during their European travels, the Vanderlips pioneered the Montessori method at the Edward Harden Mansion in nearby Sleepy Hollow by creating the first Montessori school in the United States, in 1912. Frank Vanderlip's sister Ruth was married to Harden; the families maintained close ties. After a year existing in two <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Harden residence, the school moved to the River Gate House {{at the north end of}} River Road and the Beechwood estate.|$|E

5|$|The {{entrance}} to the keep was located in an avant-corps on the northern side, with a vaulted passageway between two gates leading from the outer courtyard to the inner <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keep. The keep itself features just two round towers of 5m diameter with square bases, both located {{on the western side}} and within the outer ward. The more southern of the two is almost totally ruined, probably as a result of Ibrahim Pasha's destruction. The more exposed eastern and southern sides featured no towers. According to the historian Kevin Andrews, this is perhaps because they were judged to be adequately protected by the steep terrain.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of seals of Shepseskare in the oldest part of Neferefre's mortuary temple could {{indicate that the}} former also undertook construction works there. The evidence for such works is uncertain: these seals could have been placed on boxes which were later moved into the magazine <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple. For example, seals of Userkaf, Sahure and Neferirkare Kakai were {{also found in the}} temple, while these three pharaohs died before Neferefre's reign.|$|E

The {{gameplay}} takes place in boxing arenas, {{some of which are}} based on locations in Japan and include Korakuen Hall, Ryogoku Sports Arena, and the Osaka Prefectural Gymnasium. Other locations include the mountainous area around Niigata, and an outdoor boxing ring set in post-World War II Tokyo, Japan.|$|E

5|$|After the service, some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a healer {{in one of}} the small <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple—although the desservant who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for a few minutes the request that he wishes to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably to convey the fluid. The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} by the Board of Works in 1751 concluded that the parliamentary clerk's house was in a poor condition and unsuitable for habitation. In particular, it lacked a kitchen and scullery, and the cooking was still being {{carried out in the}} ground floor <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jewel Tower. Two three-storey brick houses– later titled 6–7 Old Palace Yard– were built in its place between 1754 and 1755, possibly by the architect Kenton Couse, at a cost of £2,432. The Jewel Tower was accessed from the Old Palace Yard through a central passageway that ran between the houses, and a range of subsidiary buildings were built behind the houses, joining them and the tower, while the tower continued to be used for preparing food.|$|E
5|$|Back at Berkeley from Johns Hopkins, Stratton {{stayed in}} the {{philosophy}} department as its second faculty member and first psychology specialist until the psychology department broke off in 1922. The new department started with four people: Stratton as chair; Edward Chace Tolman, with a Harvard degree, and an initiator of rodent experiments soiling the <b>rooms</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> philosophy department and hastening the split of the psychology division; Brown, Stratton's earlier student and Berkeley faculty member from 1908 onward; and Olga Bridgman, the first Berkeley psychology PhD awardee, albeit from the philosophy department. Before the split Stratton had set up Berkeley's first psychology lab in the philosophy department and taught psychology courses with Brown. The courses included sensation, perception, emotion, memory, and applications of psychology to professions such as law, medicine, schooling and clerical work by priests.|$|E
