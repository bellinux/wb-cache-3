5|$|Ida is {{classified}} as an S-type asteroid based on ground-based spectroscopic measurements. The composition of S-types was uncertain before the Galileo flybys, but was interpreted to be either of two minerals found in meteorites that had fallen to the Earth: ordinary chondrite (OC) and stony-iron. Estimates of Ida's density are constrained to less than 3.2g/cm3 by the long-term stability of Dactyl's orbit. This all but <b>rules</b> <b>out</b> a stony-iron composition; were Ida made of 5g/cm3 iron- and nickel-rich material, {{it would have to}} contain more than 40% empty space.|$|E
5|$|Pteranodon was {{notable for}} its skull crest, though the {{function}} of this crest has been a subject of debate. Most explanations {{have focused on the}} blade-like, backward pointed crest of male P. longiceps, however, and ignored the wide range of variation across age and sex. The fact that the crests vary so much <b>rules</b> <b>out</b> most practical functions other than for use in mating displays. Therefore, display was probably the main function of the crest, and any other functions were secondary.|$|E
5|$|Events with a {{duration}} of less than about two seconds are classified as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins. Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters. This <b>rules</b> <b>out</b> a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae.|$|E

5|$|Repeating nines also {{turn up in}} {{yet another}} of Georg Cantor's works. They {{must be taken into}} account to {{construct}} a valid proof, applying his 1891 diagonal argument to decimal expansions, of the uncountability of the unit interval. Such a proof needs to be able to declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal expansions, so one needs to avoid pairs like 0.2 and 0.1999... A simple method represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions; the opposite method <b>rules</b> <b>out</b> repeating nines. A variant that may be closer to Cantor's original argument actually uses base 2, and by turning base-3 expansions into base-2 expansions, one can prove the uncountability of the Cantor set as well.|$|E
5|$|The early texts do {{not contain}} just-war {{ideology}} as such. Some argue that a sutta in the Gamani Samyuttam <b>rules</b> <b>out</b> all military service. In this passage, a soldier asks the Buddha {{if it is true}} that, as he has been told, soldiers slain in battle are reborn in a heavenly realm. The Buddha reluctantly replies that if he is killed in battle while his mind is seized with the intention to kill, he will undergo an unpleasant rebirth. In the early texts, a person's mental state at the time of death is generally viewed as having a great impact on the next birth.|$|E
5|$|The {{poisonous}} pitohuis, {{including the}} hooded pitohui, are not thought {{to create the}} toxic compound themselves but instead sequester them from their diet. Phyllobates frogs kept in captivity do not develop the toxins, {{and the extent of}} the toxicity varies both in the pitohuis across their range and also across the range of the unrelated blue-capped ifrit, another New Guinean bird found with toxic skin and feathers. Both of these facts suggest that the toxins are obtained from the diet. The presence of the toxins in the internal organs as well as the skins and feathers <b>rules</b> <b>out</b> the possibility that the toxins are applied topically from an unknown source by the birds.|$|E

5|$|An {{extensive}} {{review of}} these theories (excepting that of Preston) {{is given in}} Jurens's 1987 article. Its main conclusion is that the loss was almost certainly precipitated by the explosion of a 4-inch magazine, but that {{there are several ways}} this could have been initiated, although he <b>rules</b> <b>out</b> the boat deck fire or the detonation of her torpedoes as probable causes. In Jurens's opinion, the popular image of plunging shells penetrating Hoods deck armour is inaccurate, as by his estimation the angle of fall of Bismarcks 15-inch shells at the moment of the loss would not have exceeded about 14°, an angle so unfavourable to penetration of horizontal armour that it is actually off the scale of contemporaneous German penetration charts. Moreover, computer-generated profiles of Hood show that a shell falling at this angle could not have reached an aft magazine without first passing through some part of the belt armour. On the other hand, the 12-inch belt could have been penetrated, if Hood had progressed sufficiently far into her final turn.|$|E
5|$|If morning {{cortisol}} {{levels are}} over 500nmol/l, ACTH deficiency is unlikely, whereas a level less than 100 is indicative. Levels between 100-500 require a stimulation test. This, too, {{is done with}} the insulin tolerance test. A cortisol level above 500 after achieving a low blood sugar <b>rules</b> <b>out</b> ACTH deficiency, while lower levels confirm the diagnosis. A similar stimulation test using corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is not sensitive enough {{for the purposes of}} the investigation. If the insulin tolerance test yields an abnormal result, a further test measuring the response of the adrenal glands to synthetic ACTH (the ACTH stimulation test) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Stimulation testing with metyrapone is an alternative. Some suggest that an ACTH stimulation test is sufficient as first-line investigation, and that an insulin tolerance test is only needed if the ACTH test is equivocal. The insulin tolerance test is discouraged in children. None of the tests for ACTH deficiency are perfect, and further tests after a period of time may be needed if initial results are not conclusive.|$|E

25|$|There are two {{equivalent}} ways of {{asserting that}} the universe is partially ordered: Assume either M1–M3, or that Proper Parthood is transitive and asymmetric, hence a strict partial order.

25|$|Interestingly, the Philippine creepers, {{a single}} genus of three species of treecreeper-like birds {{appear to be}} highly apomorphic members of the more initial {{radiation}} of the Sturnidae.

In addition, biogeography virtually <b>rules</b> <b>out</b> a close relationship of Philippine creepers and treecreepers, as neither the latter nor their close relatives seem have ever reached the Wallacea, let alone the Philippines. Nonetheless, their inclusion in the Sturnidae is not entirely final and eventually they may remain a separate family.|$|E
25|$|Preempted diagnoses. Although the DSM-IV <b>rules</b> <b>out</b> {{concurrent}} {{diagnosis of}} many other conditions along with autism, the full criteria for ADHD, Tourette syndrome, and other of these conditions are often present and these comorbid diagnoses are increasingly accepted. A 2008 study found that nearly 70% of children with ASD {{had at least one}} psychiatric disorder, including nearly 30% with social anxiety disorder and similar proportions with ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder. Childhood-onset schizophrenia, a rare and severe form, is another preempted diagnosis whose symptoms are often present along with the symptoms of autism.|$|E
25|$|While {{it is not}} {{impossible}} that some binaries might be created through gravitational capture between two single stars, given the very low likelihood of such an event (three objects are actually required, as conservation of energy <b>rules</b> <b>out</b> a single gravitating body capturing another) and {{the high number of}} binaries, this cannot be the primary formation process. Also, the observation of binaries consisting of pre main-sequence stars, supports the theory that binaries are already formed during star formation. Fragmentation of the molecular cloud during the formation of protostars is an acceptable explanation for the formation of a binary or multiple star system.|$|E
