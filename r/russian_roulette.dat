Despite Scully's pleading, Mulder pulls the trigger first at Modell and then himself, the hammer falling on an empty chamber both times. Modell then makes him aim the gun at Scully. At the last instant, Scully sees a fire alarm in a mirror and pulls it in desperation, {{breaking}} Modell's concentration. Mulder instantly switches his aim to Modell and pulls the trigger; the bullet is fired and Modell is severely wounded.|$|E

Although {{she does not want}} to marry him, Tarafdar persuades her with a promise that she will be the sole heir of his property. Actually bankrupt, he tries to poison Susanna with mushroom soup several years later for her inheritance. Her butler drinks it by accident and dies instead; in a state of shock, she shoots Tarafdar during a game of <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette.</b> That night, Susanna sets her house ablaze in another suicide attempt. Seeing the house on fire, her maid (who has six toes) tries to rescue her but dies in the attempt.|$|E
5|$|Purebred Arabians have {{excelled in}} open events against other breeds. One {{of the most}} famous {{examples}} in the field of western riding competition was the Arabian mare Ronteza, who defeated 50 horses of all breeds to win the 1961 Reined Cow Horse championship at the Cow Palace in San Francisco, California. Another Arabian competitive against all breeds was the stallion Aaraf who won an all-breed cutting horse competition at the Quarter Horse Congress in the 1950s. In show jumping and show hunter competition, a number of Arabians have competed successfully against other breeds in open competition, including the purebred gelding <b>Russian</b> <b>Roulette,</b> who has won multiple jumping classes against horses of all breeds on the open circuit, and in eventing, a purebred Arabian competed on the Brazilian team at the 2004 Athens Olympics.|$|E
5|$|In Rio de Janeiro, Mr. A and Sunehri {{plan their}} next heist. As Dixit's {{analysis}} has named Rio {{the location of}} Mr. A's next heist, Jai and Ali travel to the city. There they meet Monali (Bipasha Basu), Shonali's twin sister, and Ali immediately falls for her. Meanwhile, the relationship between Mr. A and Sunehri evolves into romance and he unveils his real identity, Aryan, to her. However, he sees Sunehri and Jai together and realizes that Sunehri has been working undercover for Jai. Aryan forces Sunehri {{to play a game}} of <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette.</b> Sunehri cries and refuses to shoot Aryan because she loves him, but Aryan forces her to play. After six attempted shots from the gun, neither is injured, because Aryan has not loaded the gun. Sunehri admits she betrayed Aryan and confesses her love for him. In their final heist, Aryan and Sunehri successfully steal some early Lydian coins while disguised as performing dwarfs. Sunehri indicates that she does not wish to remain allied with Jai, forcing Jai and Ali to go after them. After the chase, all of them end up {{on the top of a}} waterfall, where Ali catches Sunehri. Sunehri, despite conveying her feelings for Aryan, shoots him. Aryan falls from the waterfall, after which Jai allows Sunehri to go free.|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of {{modelling}} {{it is easier to}} find academic papers, guidelines tailored to specific disciplines and handbooks of numerical simulation rather than plain textbooks of broad appeal. The various academic communities go about modelling largely independently of each other. Is this an indication that modelling is not a science but a craft, as argued by epistemologists? In other words, is it because it is impossible to define a single set of rules to encode natural or man-made systems into sets of mathematical rules called models? If modelling is in fact characterized by such heterogeneity and lack of systematization, it might seem overly ambitious to offer a set of good practices of universal application in sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, if one looks at the available literature, in most instances "snsitivities"are understood as derivatives of a particular output versus a particular input (such as elasticities in economics). This is not surprising, as contemporary researchers ¿ like the authors of the present volume ¿ are likely to have received more training in calculus than in Monte Carlo methods and to have seen more Jacobians and Hessians than <b>Russian</b> <b>roulettes.</b> A minority of senitivity analysis practitioners (mostly in statistics, risk analysis and reliability) actively use importance measures such as those described in this book, whereby the influence of factors on outputs is assessed by looking at the entire input space rather than at a point in that space. Slowly these methods are finding their way into more recent modelling guidelines in other disciplines (see, for example, those of the Environmental Protection Agency in the USA, EPA, 2001). The purpose of this book is to offer to students an easy-to-read manual for sensitivity analysis covering importance measures and to show how these global methods may help to produce more robust or parsimonious models as well as to make models more defensible in the face of scientific or technical controversy.

25|$|The {{film was}} {{based in part on}} an unproduced {{screenplay}} called The Man Who Came to Play by Louis Garfinkle and Quinn K. Redeker, about Las Vegas and <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette.</b> Producer Michael Deeley, who bought the script, hired writer/director Michael Cimino who, with Deric Washburn, rewrote the script, taking the <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette</b> element and placing it in the Vietnam War. The film went over-budget and over-schedule, and ended up costing $15 million. The scenes depicting <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette</b> were highly controversial after the film's release.|$|E

25|$|The Carters {{married on}} October 14, 1931. In {{addition}} to Hodding and Philip, {{they had a}} younger son, Thomas Hennen Carter (1945–1964), who killed himself playing a game of <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Natas {{released}} its first album, Life After Death on Reel Life. Following {{the release of}} this album, Esham, Natas and Reel Life Productions were {{the subject of much}} controversy when a 17-year-old fan killed himself while smoking cannabis and playing <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette</b> while listening to Life After Death.|$|E
25|$|The Viet Cong <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette</b> {{scenes were}} shot in real circumstances, with real rats and mosquitoes, {{as the three}} {{principals}} (De Niro, Walken, and Savage) were tied up in bamboo cages erected along the River Kwai. The woman who was given the task of casting the extras in Thailand had much difficulty finding a local to play the vicious-looking individual who runs the game. The first actor hired {{turned out to be}} incapable of slapping De Niro in the face. The caster then found a local Thai man with a particular dislike of Americans, and cast him accordingly. De Niro suggested that Walken be slapped for real by one of the guards without any warning. The reaction on Walken's face was genuine. Producer Deeley has said that Cimino shot the brutal Vietcong <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette</b> scenes brilliantly and more efficiently than any other part of the film.|$|E
25|$|According to Cimino, De Niro {{requested}} a live cartridge in the revolver for {{the scene in}} which he subjects John Cazale's character to an impromptu game of <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette,</b> to heighten {{the intensity of the}} situation. Cazale agreed without protest, but obsessively rechecked the gun before each take {{to make sure that the}} live round wasn't next in the chamber.|$|E

The network produced six seasons of the show from 2002 to 2007.|$|E
25|$|The film's initial reviews {{were largely}} positive. It was hailed by many critics {{as the best}} American epic since Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather. The film was praised for its {{depiction}} of realistic working class settings and environment; Cimino's direction; the performances of De Niro, Walken, Streep, Savage, Dzundza and Cazale; the symphonic shifts of tone and pacing in moving from America to Vietnam; the tension during the <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette</b> scenes; and the themes of American disillusionment.|$|E
25|$|The {{fourteen}} Hooded Men {{were the}} only internees subjected to the full five techniques. However, over the following months, some internees were subjected {{to at least one}} of the five techniques, as well as other interrogation methods. These allegedly included waterboarding, electric shocks, burning with matches and candles, forcing internees to stand over hot electric fires while beating them, beating and squeezing of the genitals, inserting objects into the anus, injections, whipping the soles of the feet, and psychological abuse such as <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Zionists who quote the Maharal's commentary on Ketubot, anti-Zionist writers {{have said that}} even if the oaths are to be seen as decrees, it was obviously not God's intent that the Jewish people should keep trying to return to the Land of Israel and build a state until they hit the right moment. In view of the harsh consequences of failure ("I will declare your flesh ownerless like the gazelles and hinds of the field"), this would be as foolish as playing <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette.</b> Furthermore, the success of the State of Israel so far is not proof that the decree has been annulled, since the future of the state is still uncertain.|$|E
25|$|He tracks down Grinda, who {{has made}} a lot of money from the Russian roulette-playing Nick. He finds Nick in a crowded {{gambling}} club, but Nick appears to have no recollection of his friends or his home. Mike enters the game of <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette</b> against Nick, hoping to jog his memory and persuade him to come home, but Nick's mind is gone. To keep him from taking another turn, Mike grabs Nick's arms, which are covered in scars. At the last moment, after Mike reminds Nick of their hunting trips together, Nick recognizes Mike and smiles. Nick raises the gun to his temple, and pulls the trigger, killing himself. Mike tries reviving him, but to no avail.|$|E
25|$|Deeley {{felt the}} revised script, now called The Deer Hunter, broke fresh {{ground for the}} project. The protagonist in the Redeker/Garfinkle script, Merle, was an {{individual}} who sustained a bad injury in active service and was damaged psychologically by his violent experiences, but was nevertheless a tough character with strong nerves and guts. Cimino and Washburn's revised script distilled the three aspects of Merle's personality and separated them out into three distinct characters. They became three old friends {{who grew up in}} the same small industrial town and worked in the same steel mill, and in due course were drafted together to Vietnam. In the original script, the roles of Merle (later renamed Mike) and Nick were reversed in the last half of the film. Nick returns home to Linda, while Mike remains in Vietnam, sends money home to help Steven, and meets his tragic fate at the <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette</b> table.|$|E
25|$|After {{consulting}} various Hollywood agents, Deeley found writer-director Michael Cimino, {{represented by}} Stan Kamen at the William Morris Agency. Deeley {{was impressed by}} Cimino's TV commercial work and crime film Thunderbolt and Lightfoot (1974). Cimino himself was confident that he could further develop the principal characters of The Man Who Came to Play without losing {{the essence of the}} original. After Cimino was hired, he was called into a meeting with Garfinkle and Redeker at the EMI office. According to Deeley, Cimino questioned the need for the <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette</b> element of the script, and Redeker made such a passionate case for it that he ended up literally on his knees. Over the course of further meetings, Cimino and Deeley discussed the work needed {{at the front of the}} script, and Cimino believed he could develop the stories of the main characters in the first 20 minutes of film.|$|E
25|$|Nick recuperates in a {{military}} hospital in Saigon with no knowledge of his friends. After being released, he goes AWOL and aimlessly stumbles through the red-light district at night. He encounters Julien Grinda, a Frenchman, outside a gambling den where men play <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette</b> for money. Grinda entices the reluctant Nick to participate and leads him into the den. Mike {{is present in the}} den, watching the game, but the two friends do not notice each other at first. When Mike does see Nick, he is unable to get his attention. When Nick is introduced into the game, he grabs the gun, fires it at the current contestant, and then again at his own temple, causing the audience to riot in protest. Grinda hustles Nick outside to his car to escape the angry mob. Mike cannot catch up with them as they speed away.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, {{a massive}} change in both {{leadership}} and programming {{at the network}} took place. Liberty Media acquired a 50% stake in the network and changed its leadership. President Michael Fleming and vice president Jake Tauber were both fired and former Fox Family Channel president Rich Cronin were hired to head the network. He and incoming vice president Bob Boden began the biggest original programming venture since the network's inception, launching Whammy! The All-New Press Your Luck, Friend or Foe?, <b>Russian</b> <b>Roulette,</b> Lingo, WinTuition and Cram. In addition, {{in the fall of}} 2001, the network acquired the rights to air the classic Press Your Luck (excluding the Michael Larson episodes, due to pressure from CBS; this angered many fans, resulting in CBS eventually giving Game Show Network the rights to the Larson episodes, airing them in a separate package, as well as in conjunction with the documentary Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal).|$|E
25|$|Miller {{continued}} the title {{in a similar}} vein to McKenzie. Resuming the drastic metamorphosis the previous writer had begun, Miller took the step of essentially ignoring all of Daredevil's continuity prior to his run on the series; on the occasions where older villains and supporting cast were used, their characterizations and history with Daredevil were reworked or overwritten. Most prominently, dedicated and loving father Jack Murdock was reimagined as a drunkard who physically abused his son Matt, entirely revising Daredevil's reasons for becoming a lawyer. Spider-Man villain Kingpin was introduced as Daredevil's new nemesis, displacing most of his large rogues gallery. Daredevil himself was gradually developed into an antihero. In issue #181 (April 1982), he attempts to murder Bullseye by throwing him off a tall building; when the villain survives as a quadriplegic, he breaks into his hospital room and tries to scare him to death by playing a two-man variation on <b>Russian</b> <b>roulette</b> with a secretly unloaded gun.|$|E
