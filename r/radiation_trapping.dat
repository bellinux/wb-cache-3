40|$|Abstract. The {{question}} of how continuum <b>radiation</b> <b>trapped</b> in Jupiterâ€™s magnetosphere might be generated is considered. It is shown that {{the efficiency of the}} linear conversion is not sufficient to account for the observed intensity of the emission. We discuss nonlinear processes that can more easily provide the required conversion efficiency. The field strengths of upper hybrid waves required to generate the fundamental harmonic emissions are; 0. 5 4 4 mV m 21. Comparison {{of the results of the}} discussed model with electric fields reported in the Jovian magnetosphere shows that the model adequately explains the generation of continuum <b>radiation</b> <b>trapped</b> in the planetary cavity. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an analytical}} method to investigate <b>radiation</b> <b>trapping</b> problems with Doppler frequency redistribution. The problem is formulated {{within the framework}} of the Holstein-Biberman-Payne equation. We interpret the basic integro-differential trapping equation as a generalized wave equation for a four-dimensional (4 D) classical system (an associated quasiparticle). We then construct its analytical solution by a semiclassical approach, called the geometrical quantization technique (GQT). Within the GQT, it is shown that the spatial and frequency variables can be separated and that the frequency part of the excited atom distribution function obeys a stationary Schrodinger equation for a perturbed oscillator. We demonstrate that there is a noticeable deviation of the actual spectral emission profile from the Doppler line in the region of small opacities. The problem of calculating the spatial mode structure and the effective <b>radiation</b> <b>trapping</b> factors is reduced to the evaluation of wave functions and quantized energy values of the quasiparticle confined in the vapor cell. We formulate the quantization rules and derive the phase factors, which allow us to obtain analytically the complete spectrum of the trapping factors in 1 D geometries (layer, cylinder, sphere) and other (2 D and 3 D) geometries when the separation of space variables is possible. Finally, we outline a possible extension of our method to treat <b>radiation</b> <b>trapping</b> effects for more general experimental situations including, for instance, a system of cold atoms...|$|E
