40|$|The goal of my {{research}} project is to analyse processes of (re) productions of regions within the biogas sector and illustrate different development paths. The case study {{is located in the}} border area of Luxembourg and Germany. The application of renewable energies in decentralised ways is considered being the ultimate chance for a long lasting prosperous and environmentally sound regional development, since they trigger various positive effects (e. g. regional value added, less power loss, lower susceptibility to discrepancies, substitution of energy imports, job creation etc.). To effectively and efficiently implement decentralised renewables, such as bioenergy, photovoltaics or wind power, the interaction and collaboration of various regional and sub-/supra-regional actors is necessary. They all – at least slightly - differ in their perspectives on challenges for energy supply {{as well as on the}} region itself. Hence, questions of space and scale arise: If the transition to renewable energies can be achieved by a decentralised utilisation, where does this take place, what is the region for implementing them? Or vice versa – my core research question: Which processes of <b>regionalisations</b> are initiated through the utilisation of renewable energies, especially biogas production? To address this question, I apply a multi-theory and multi-method approach. In theoretic terms, I put on two “glasses”. On the one hand, I analyse institutional and structural conditions that frame processes of <b>regionalisations</b> in the biogas economy and how these conditions relate to socio-technical developments. My theoretical approach is based on evolutionary institutionalism and socio-technical transition studies. Therefor, industrial networks and strategic games, techno-scientific knowledge, cultural and symbolic meanings, sectorial policies, as well as markets and user practices are important elements of analysis. It is important to be aware of the dynamic dimension of frameworks (development and change / evolution), the concurrence of political, social, economic and technical processes, the long lasting transformations, and the spatial differences (context) (cf. Boschma/Frenken, 2006; Glückler, 2007; Hayter, 2004; Jones/Murphy, 2010; Truffer, 2008) – that are typical not only for decentralised technologies. My focuses of investigation from this perspective are threefold. First, I explore the legal framework, contractual agreements and association/group structures that relate to biogas production. Second, I study the political, social, and economic developments in the biogas sector and their effects on technological developments. And third, I analyse the alignments of institutional structures and individual decision making with new biogas technologies. I apply a retrospective perspective, looking back at the period from the mid- 1990 s (liberalisation of EU energy market, upcoming of bioenergy) till today. On the other hand, I shift the focus to economic practices and everyday actions of actors in the biogas economy (e. g. operators, investors). The main goals are to analyse the economic utilisation of spatial categories and contexts, and to uncover the relationship of economy, action and spatial references. In which ways do everyday actions constitute, reproduce and transform scale and space metaphors („regions“) ? Which action responses do they trigger? Which external <b>regionalisations</b> influence the actors’ decisions – <b>regionalisations</b> “done” by non-economic actors (e. g. planners, politicians, NGOs, media) ? How do biogas producers perceive external <b>regionalisations?</b> I focus on processes of constitution and reproduction of different types of energy regions and the modes and patterns, in which practices influence the processes of <b>regionalisations</b> – following Benno Werlen’s theory of everyday <b>regionalisations</b> (Werlen, 1999; 2007; 2010). In terms of methodology I am currently using two different concepts. Since I apply, on the one hand, an action oriented approach to <b>regionalisations,</b> I conduct interviews with actors in the biogas economy to investigate elements such as perceptions, performances, patterns, power relations, or intensions. I will set these elements in the context of scale and space metaphors: doings and sayings with spatial references or connotations – whether explicit or implicit. On the other hand I apply document analysis for extracting different “regions” that are expressed, for example, in strategy papers, business reports, official statements, laws, directives, planning documents, or media coverage. I will, in another step, confront experts with the findings from the second data source to examine, how they – if at all – perceive them and how they incorporate them into their practices. The findings and theoretical thoughts shall lead to a better understanding of processes of <b>regionalisations</b> and different concepts or connotations of the region, for theoretical purposes as well as to inform policy making. Furthermore, I aim at enriching or even opening the floor for two discussions. At the one hand, how theories of economic practice might enrich evolutionary approaches to understand economic processes. At the other hand – and in the context of a energy / bioenergy debate – how a new perspective on the relations between economy and environment can help us to conceptualise an Environmental Economic Geography that takes Economic/Corporate Greening, Environmental Governance, Facets of North-South-Relations and other Greening Contexts serious...|$|R
40|$|The {{utilisation}} {{of renewable}} energies (RE) {{can be seen}} {{as one of the most}} important aspects of mitigation of climate change. Implementing them in decentralised structures additionally enhances the positive effects on environment, economy, and society. By that, RE development is a major asset for sustainability in regional development contexts. To achieve it, collaboration and cooperation of various regional actors is necessary. These actors differ in their perspectives on challenges for energy development as well as on the region itself. Hence, questions of space and scale are rising: If sustainable regional development can be achieved by the decentralised utilisation of RE, which “region” develops? Or to put it vice versa: Which processes of <b>regionalisations</b> are initiated through the use of RE (energetic <b>regionalisations)</b> ? The paper contributes to the conference’s theme “Scales, territories and networks”. The particular elements of rescaling, different geographical scales and the region as open space are subject of this article. The interplay of governmental and economic constructions of scales is point of interest. One focus lies on bioenergy production and related processes of <b>regionalisations</b> in the cross-border context of Germany and Luxembourg. On the one hand, the evolution of and transition to bioenergy production is focus of the theoretical analysis. Which institutional and structural (pre) conditions are fundamental for processes of <b>regionalisations</b> in the biomass industry? In which ways are they connected to the socio-technical development? These questions are addressed with the conceptual approaches of evolutionary institutionalism and socio-technical transition. The first building block concentrates on institutionalisations, relevance of structures for individual actions and impacts of individual behaviours on institutions. The latter building block focuses changes in technology and their social implications, social changes and their potentials for technological changes, and ‘spheres’ of socio-technical changes among niches, regimes and landscapes – all aspects with respect to bioenergy development. On the other hand the day-to-day practices of individual actors in the bioenergy market are focused. In which ways do practices influence <b>regionalisations?</b> The research motivation shifts to processes of constitution and reproduction of bioenergy-regions. “The bioenergy-regions” are produced through embodied practices and reproduce themself within these practices. Hence, bioenergy-¬regions and -spaces do not exist per se, but are socially constructed. So on the one hand, the social use of spatial categories and contexts regarding bioenergy are analytical objects. On the other hand, the relation among society, practice and spatial connotations will be addressed. The paper focuses on the conceptual framework of an ongoing research project and discusses the underlying theoretical perspectives, their operationalisation as well as the methodological research design. In empirical terms, preliminary results from an exploratory pilot study (data analysis, expert interviews) in the cross-border area of Germany and Luxembourg will be presented...|$|R
40|$|For {{rural areas}} the {{utilisation}} of renewable energies can support a prosperous development. Economic practices are increasingly important for understanding changes in this sector. The interplay of economic practices with corporate and governmental policies {{is related to}} questions of space and scale, such as: which everyday economic practices form energy markets changes; which conditions frame regional policies and practices; which processes of <b>regionalisations</b> evolve? The core interests of the paper are to analyse processes of constitution and reproduction {{of different types of}} energy regions and markets, and how practices and policies of such “energetic regionalisations“ intertwine – applying a multi-theory and multi-method (Interviews, Document Analysis) approach, focussing on biogas production in Luxembourg and Germany. I examine institutional and structural conditions that frame processes of <b>regionalisations</b> in the biogas economy and how these relate to socio-technical developments – based on evolutionary institutionalism and socio-technical transition studies. Important elements are: (1) The dynamic dimension of frameworks; (2) the concurrence of political, social, economic and technical processes; (3) the spatial differences of energy related policies.

40|$|Maintenance of {{biodiversity}} in many Australian landscapes will be best {{achieved by the}} integration of nature conservation and sustainable land management practices, in addition to formal systems of conservation reserves. Implementation of off-reserve conservation management requires an adequate understanding of ecological values and processes and the biodiversity {{costs and benefits of}} prevailing land use practices. This study is concerned with the Astrebla (Mitchell grass) tussock grasslands and related sparse woodlands and shrublands that occur on heavy clay soils in arid and semi-arid northern Australia. Covering an area of approximately 420 OOOkm 2, they {{are one of the most}} important of the Australian rangelands and virtually their entire extent is given over to grazing of cattle and sheep on native pastures. Consequently, Mitchell grasslands are poorly represented in the national reserve system and there is a lack of ecological knowledge, particularly regarding the fauna, to inform decisions about conservation management. The aim of this study was to address this knowledge gap, in order to determine the most effective approach to conservation management in this environment. Biogeographic context To assess the distinctiveness of Mitchell grassland communities at a sub-continental scale, biogeographic <b>regionalisations</b> of the Northern Territory were developed by classification of 0. 5 ° x 0. 5 ° cells according to their plant and vertebrate composition.

40|$|Recent {{applications}} of Foucauldian categories in geography, spatial {{history and the}} history of town planning have opened up interesting new perspectives, with respect to both the evolution of spatial knowledge and the genealogy of territorial techniques and their relation to larger socio-political projects, that would be enriched if combined with other discursive traditions. This article proposes to conceptualise English parliamentary enclosureea favourite episode for Marxist historiography, frequently read in a strictly materialist fashioneas a precedent of a new form of sociospatial governmentality, a political technology that inaugurates a strategic manipulation of territory for social change on the threshold between feudal and capitalist spatial rationalities. I analyse the sociospatial dimensions of parliamentary enclosure’s technical and legal innovations and compare them to the forms of communal self-regulation of land use customs and everyday <b>regionalisations</b> that preceded it. Through a systematic, replicable mechanism of reterritorialisation, enclosure acts normalised spatial regulations, blurred regional differences in the social organisation of agriculture and erased the modes of autonomous social reproduction linked to common land. Their exercise of dispossession of material resources, social capital and community representations is interpreted therefore as an inaugural logic that would pervade the emergent spatial rationality later known as planning...|$|R
40|$|Analysing spatial {{variations}} in regional economic performance {{is a common}} focus for research by regional scientists. Typically such investigations suffer from using de jure regions (such as Local Government Aras) as the spatial base as data tend to be readily available for such administrative areas to derive the variables that researchers use in econometric modelling. But using those de jure regions means we encounter the modifiable area unit problem (MAUP) which necessitates making adjustments to address spatial autocorrelation issues. It is preferable to use functional regions as the spatial base for such investigations, but that {{is often difficult to}} achieve. This paper outlines how, in Australia, we have undertaken research to derive functional economic regions (FERs) to provide an improved spatial data base that is functional and not de jure-based to address the autocorrelation issue. To do that we employ the Intramax procedure applied to journey-to-work (JTW) commuting flows data that is available from the 2011 census.

The Basin is classified into nine regions with similar historical fish assemblages (i. e. without major human intervention), using data that combine expert opinion, museum collections and historical records. These regions are (1) Darling Basin Plains, (2) Northern Uplands, (3) Murray Basin Plains, (4) Northern Alps, (5) Central East, (6) Avoca Lowland, (7) Southern Slopes, (8) Southern Alps and (9) South-Western Slopes.

Sustainable Rivers Audit data are compared with the historical assemblages, highlighting species whose range and abundance have changed since the early 19 th century. Notable changes include declines in native species such as silver perch, river blackfish, mountain galaxias, Macquarie perch, trout cod and freshwater catfish, {{and the advent of}} alien species including common carp, eastern gambusia, goldfish, redfin perch, brown trout and rainbow trout.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} psychological {{basis of the}} process of migration destination choice. Specifically, it attempts to demonstrate that this process is hierarchical in nature, meaning that migrants group potential destinations into clusters or regions and examine the characteristics of groups of destinations before comparing specific locations within preferred regions. An examination of the variation in this hierarchical behaviour between migrants from different origins also provides valuable insights into the nature and role of cognitive space: that is, each individual's internal representation of the world around them. Four different techniques are used to illustrate hierarchical aspects of migrant's decisionmaking: the competing destinations model; two variants of the nested logit model; and a novel hybrid model. Hierarchical behaviour is demonstrated through comparison of these models with the traditional 'flat-processing' migration model. Migration data used in this research covers moves within Great Britain and is derived from the 1991 UK Census of Population with several other sources providing information describing the various potential migration destinations. This research will contribute both theoretically and methodologically to the field of migration research. It is novel in its hierarchical approach to modelling the UK internal migration destination choice process, and also in its algorithms for generating the discrete and probabilistic <b>regionalisations</b> of space that are used to represent migrants' hierarchical destination choice sets.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{comparatively}} new philosophy of bioregionalism {{to see what}} it might have to offer the environmental management process. The foundations of bioregional philosophy stretch back into the early part of last century with roots in the thinking of the early 'anarchist geographers' such as Peter Kropotkin. Input also comes from contemporaneous regionalist planners such as Patrick Geddes and Lewis Mumford. However, {{it was not until the}} early 1970 s that Alan van Newkirk coined the phrase 'Bioregion'. Since then there has been steady growth in bioregional literature that clearly aligns it to ecocentric philosophies that are embraced by social movements like "Deep Ecology". However, the most important part of bioregionalism is the bioregions construct. Whatever the philosophical inclinations of bioregionalist authors, the bioregion is presented as an identifiable entity, which is suited to be the basis for the formulation of strategy and planning and it is this that is of interest to this thesis. The basis for the study is the hypothesis that the need for a holistic approach to environmental management and planning requires more than the incremental approaches currently used, if tragedies like Easter Island are not to be repeated on a larger scale. The idea of future state visioning is taken from industry and commerce and given an environmental perspective to provide the visionary dimension required by such a holistic process. However, a visionary process is best served by a visualization tool, particularly where non-expert, community participation is deemed essential. The process of mapping bioregions is just such a tool. The proposal that bioregional mapping is suitable as a tool requires that bioregions, as a construct, are demonstrable entities, as claimed by the literature. Tberefore, a mapping exercise that allowed the testing of this principle was undertaken for Scotland as the test area. A methodology was developed, using a Geographical Information System to assist in the mapping and analysis. Statistical analysis of the resultant theoretical bioregional model showed that the bioregions had good agreement with other methods of dividing Scotland into regions. They also showed better agreement with these other <b>regionalisations</b> than politically defined regions. The notion that watersheds can be substituted for bioregions was rejected. Therefore, it was shown that bioregions are demonstrable entities,albeit sensitive to scale. The bioregions produced from first principles were compared to an independent qualitatively developed model, The results of this comparison reinforces a suggestion that a 'science of quantities' needs to be tempered by a 'science of qualities' when stakeholder participation and interpretation is important. The dramatic story of the social and environmental collapse of Easter Island is a metaphor for the situation facing the Earth, as a whole on the one hand, and to introduce the arguments of sustainability and regionality on the other. Easter Island is isolated, with almost no external inputs, like the Earth, but on a different scale. However, it is also a part of the Earth. From many sources, there is agreement that the natural environment of the Earth is under threat, not just on the local scale but on a global scale as well. Bioregions are proposed as a holistic way of mapping the environment to inform the future state visioning process, which is offered as a tool at the level of strategic management. Bioregional mapping and environmental future state visioning were proposed as vehicles for stakeholder participation and the recognition of cultural factors in environmental management and planning. Future work should include investigating future state visioning solutions to more localised and community focused environmental management problems. Scotland, as the subject for analysis, provides a manageable compromise between the extreme isolation and singularity of Easter Island and the multiplicity of the regions of the world. Scotland is an area that has good data on its various forms of regionality, including cultural and biogeographic regions.
