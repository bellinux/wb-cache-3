It was said that the law authorities had so declared, and a very noble testimony to the LOYALTY of Englishmen, I think, was shown by the instant submission of high-spirited gentlemen, most keenly feeling that the nation had been subject to a coarse outrage, who were silent when told that the law was with the aggressor. The relief which presently came, when, after a pause of a day, we found that law was on our side, was indescribable. The nation MIGHT then take notice of this insult to its honor.

The central objective {{of this study is to}} chart and evaluate developments in law and practice in order to substantiate arguments in favour of an emerging customary <b>right</b> for individuals <b>to</b> receive <b>reparations</b> for serious violations of human rights and a corresponding responsibility of States. To this end, Part I explores the customary nature of human rights and humanitarian law provisions, outlines the basic premise of State responsibility in relation to violations and identifies the general international norms which establish the obligation of States <b>to</b> provide <b>reparations.</b> An examination of the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice, the Articles on State Responsibility of the International Law Commission and the convergence of norms in different branches of international law, notably human rights law, humanitarian law and international criminal law as well as extensive human rights jurisprudence, international as well as regional, supports the position that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reparations</b> is gaining customary recognition. The adoption in 2006 of the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of International Human Rights Law and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law by the General Assembly of the United Nations further strengthens this claim. Following the legal analysis, Part II of the study explores State practice in relation <b>to</b> <b>reparations</b> through four case studies; Guatemala, Sierra Leone, East Timor and Colombia between 1999 and 2009. Analysis is undertaken of peace agreements and to what extent post-conflict measures, such as Truth Commissions, have promoted State responsibility for reparations, been supported by the United Nations, interacted with human rights mechanisms and prompted subsequent elaboration of domestic legislation and reparations policies.

40|$|The present thesis {{evaluates the}} {{international}} legal standing {{of the right}} to a remedy and reparation contained in the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of Human Rights and Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law. It focuses on two aspects {{of the right to}} a remedy and reparation. First, it examines the application of state responsibility principles to the relationship between states and individuals when human rights and international humanitarian law violations are committed. Secondly, it analyses the convergence of norms of state liability in different branches of international law: human rights law, the law on diplomatic protection, international humanitarian law, and international criminal law. It advances the proposition that state responsibility for reparation in favour of individuals has crystallised in international law. The thesis is divided in four chapters. The first is an introductory chapter. It defines the scope and objective of the study, and identifies and maps the existing scholarly positions on the right to a remedy and reparation for individuals under international law. Chapter 2 describes the law of state responsibility for injuries to aliens and its relationship to the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reparation</b> in human rights law. Chapter 3 explores the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reparation</b> for international humanitarian law violations. As a conclusion, Chapter 4 assesses whether the Principles and Guidelines reflect the standards of international law previously analysed. It looks at whether principles of state responsibility can apply to the relationship between individuals and states – a basic presumption of this instrument that {{was also one of the}} main sources of contention during the drafting and adoption process at the UN. It concludes that individuals can invoke state responsibility directly under contemporary international law through an actionable <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reparation</b> for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law that constitute international wrongful acts...|$|E

40|$|With the Rome Statute for the {{international}} criminal Court, international criminal law introduces {{for the first time}} the right to reparations for victims against their offender. Article 75 of the Statute creates the right for victims to claim reparations before the court and vests the latter with the power to decide on reparations upon request or upon its own motion. This study aimed to unpack the content of this new right and assess legal mechanisms for its implementation. Specifically, this study sought to establish whether there is any substantive and procedural law applicable to reparation before the International Criminal Court (ICC), how the risk of conflict between national justice and the ICC is dispelled and how reparations orders are enforced. This study found that the ICC Statute created the right to reparations as a principle whose content should gradually be shaped and developed by the Court on a case by case basis. As regards with legal mechanisms of the implementation of the new right, the study found that procedural mechanisms are at their embryonic stage and like the content of the right they shall be developed by the Court. In addition, the study noted that complementarity principle, which governs the jurisdiction of the ICC, should be applied to the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reparation</b> before the Court. Thus the principle appears as a mechanism to dispel the risk of conflict between national judicial institutions and the ICC. Moreover, it was observed that for effective and efficient implementation of the right to reparations the ICC Statute established a legal framework for the interactivity of institutional mechanisms - the Court, the TFV and States - which play crucial role in the enforcement of reparations orders. Furthermore, the study found that some legal and practical challenges facing the effective implementation of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reparation</b> require reviewing the Court’s procedure in order that collective approach may be prioritised in reparation proceedings. It was also observed that the flexibility of the Statute provides opportunities for establishment of a Special Chamber for reparations within the Court for the purpose of complying with the requirements of fair trial. It is expected that the findings of this study will constitute an invaluable contribution to the few research already carried out on this novel topic in international criminal law and inform various actors in the field including judges, lawyers and scholars.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} fraud as a {{basis for}} the voidability of transfers in Scots law. In particular, it focuses on misrepresentation and fraud on creditors. In so doing, an attempt is made to provide a principled account of the effect of fraud on transfer which can explain the well-established rules in this area, show how these rules fit within the broader framework of private law and provide some guidance as to the appropriate result in cases where a rule is not clearly established. This account depends on examining the development of the law from a historical and comparative perspective, with particular emphasis on the periods during which the relevant rules and institutions were being developed or received in Scotland and on the links between this process and the wider ius commune tradition. The central contention is that avoidance of a transfer on the basis of fraud is justified by a personal right held by the party at whose instance the avoidance takes place. In the core cases, this personal right is a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>reparation</b> for a wrong for which the transferee is liable. At the periphery, the personal right may arise from the law of unjustified enrichment rather than from the law of delict. This characterisation of the basis of avoidance explains the protection afforded to subsequent acquirers and the limited effect which avoidance has in certain circumstances. It shows the interaction between the law of property and the law of obligations in this area and enables principles developed in the context of one instance of fraud on creditors to be applied to difficult problems in relation to other instances...|$|E
