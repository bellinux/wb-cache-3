One of the main risk factor for development of urinary tract infections was asymptomatic bacteriuria during pregnancy. Maternal urinary tract infections have serious complications for both mother and her fetus. The present study was undertaken to study of urinary tract infections in pregnancy, its causative agents and their sensitivity pattern, in the Kosar Hospital.. Methods and materials:This was a cross-sectional study conducted among the pregnant mothers referred to the Kosar Hospital during Agust 2007 and April 2013. The data from these participants were obtained by a check list and laboratory speciemens. Midstream clean catch urine samples, were collected and cultured on BA and MAC. Antibiogram was done.

40|$|Of 60 {{patients}} w'ith {{mitral stenosis}} referred as proper candidates for commissurotomy, {{less than half}} (27) proved suitable after further study. One half of these (13) had a good postoperative result as judged not only clinically but by objective physiologic measurements. The latter repre-sent the best criteria {{for the effects of}} surgery since subjective impressions may be unreliable. Eight subjects originally advised to undergo surgery would now be rejected inasmuch as myocardial in-sufficiency and not mitral block was their predominant difficulty. Clinical criteria appeal as yet inadequate for the selection of the proper candidate for mitral commissurotomy, as there is no good clinical means of establishing in every instance the presence of pulmonary hypertension which remains the best evidence of a significant degree of mitral block. SINCE Bailey', 2 and Harken 3 have dem-onstrated the feasibility of the surgical approach to the problem of mitral steno-sis, patients with this lesion are being re-evalu-ated in numerous clinics with the possibility of commissurotomy in mind.

Collection of the youngest generation requires identification of pointers into that generation from older generations; a data structure that supports such identification is called a remembered set. Various remembered set mechanisms have been proposed; these generally require mutator code to execute a write barrier when modifying pointer fields. Remembered set data structures can vary in their precision: an imprecise structure requires the garbage collector to do more work to find old-to-young pointers.

It receives extensive visual inputs and sends out-puts to several eye movement centers. It contains neurons with visual and saccade-related responses suggesting a role of area LIP in programming saccadic eye movements to visual targets. Because primates can also orient to nonvisual stimuli, we investigated whether LIP neurons process stimuli of other modalities besides the visual one by comparing their activity in auditory and visual saccade tasks. 2. We recorded the activity of single neurons of Macaca mdatta monkeys while they performed memory saccades to acoustic and visual targets. We analyzed the activity during stimulus presenta-tion (stimulus period, S) and during the delay (memory period, M) between stimulus presentation and the saccade to its <b>remembere...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} difficulty about stochastic singular {{control is}} {{to characterize the}} regularities of the value function and the optimal control policy. In this paper, a multi-dimensional singular control problem is considered. We found the optimal value function and the optimal control policy of this problem via Dynkin game, whose solution is given by the saddle point of the cost function. The existence and uniqueness of {{the solution to this}} Dynkin game are proved through an associated variational inequality problem involving Dirichlet form. As a consequence, the properties of the value function of this Dynkin game implies the smoothness of the value function of the stochastic singular control problem. In this way, we are able to show the existence of a classical solution to this multi-dimensional singular control problem, which was traditionally solved in the sense of viscosity solutions, and this enables the application of the verification theorem to prove optimality.

40|$|For {{the past}} several decades, cryptographers have consitently {{provided}} us with stronger and more capable primitives and protocols that have found many applications in security systems in everyday life. One of the central tenets of cryptographic design is that, whereas a system’s architecture ought to be public and open to scrutiny, the keys on which it depends — long, utterly random, unique strings of bits — will be perfectly preserved by their owner, and yet nominally inaccessible to foes. This security model works well {{as long as one}} can assume the existence of an inviolate physical location or storage device to safeguard those keys. In clientserver scenarios, the mere delocalization of the participants suffices to enforce a proper boundary without any further precaution. In proxy settings, one may call upon tamper-resistant “smart cards ” or hardware security modules to isolate the keys adequately from most opponents. Things break down when one can no longer assume that an external storage medium is available to store our keys, and that the only option is to <b>remembe...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, we first {{argue that it}} is {{critical}} for humans to forget; that is, to have some means of preventing out-of-date information from interfering with the recall of current information. We then argue that the primary means of accomplishing such adaptive updating of human memory is retrieval inhibition: Information that is rendered out of date by new learning becomes less retrievable, but remains at essentially full strength in memory as indexed by other measures, such as recognition and word-fragment completion. We conclude with a speculation that certain unconscious influences of prior events may, in fact, be stronger if those events were to be forgotten rather than to be remembered. 1996 Academic Press, Inc. Many situations in the real world cue us—directly or indirectly—to forget. At one time or another, we have all probably said, or had said to us, expressions like the following: ‘‘Oh, forget that. I read the wrong address. Here’s the correct one. ’ ’ Or, ‘‘Forget that! Here’s a better way to get there. ’’ Such explicit situations are greatly outnumbered by situations where a cue to forget is implicit, but nonetheless clear.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effect of top-down knowledge on search for a feature singleton (a ‘‘pop-out target’’). In a singleton detection task, advance cueing of the dimension of upcoming singleton resulted in cueing costs and benefits (Experiment 1). When {{the search for the}} singleton stayed the same but only the response requirements were changed, advance cueing failed to have an effect (Experiments 2 and 3). In singleton search only bottom-up priming plays a role (Experiments 4 and 5). We conclude that expectancy-based, top-down knowledge cannot guide the search for a featural singleton. Bottom-up priming that does facilitate search for a featural singleton cannot be influenced by top-down control. The study demonstrates that effects often attributed to early top-down guidance may represent effects that occur later in processing or represent bottom-up priming effects. Every day {{we spend a lot of}} time searching for important things such as a traffic sign at a busy crossroad, or one of our kids in a busy shopping centre. When searching for an object we have to keep in mind what we are looking for. A target template describing the target (its colour, its shape, its location, etc.) is kept in memory to guide our search process.

40|$|Rats have {{a natural}} {{tendency}} {{to spend more time}} exploring novel objects than familiar objects, and this preference can be used as an index of object recognition. Rats also show an exploratory preference for objects in locations where they have not previously encountered objects (an index of place memory) and for familiar objects in contexts different from those in which the objects were originally encountered (an index of context memory). In this experiment, rats with cytotoxic lesions of the hippocampal formation were tested on all three versions of the novelty-preference paradigm, with a 5 -min retention interval between the familiarization and test phases. Rats with sham lesions displayed a novelty preference on all three trial types, whereas the rats with hippocampal lesions displayed a novelty preference on Object trials but did not discriminate between the objects on Place trials or Context trials. The findings indicate that hippocampal damage impairs memory for contextual or spatial aspects of an experience, whereas memory for objects that were part of the same experience are left relatively intact. Findings from lesion studies indicate that the integrity of the hippocampal formation (HPC) is essential for normal memory of certain types of information about an event, whereas other information about an event may be <b>remembere...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{contributions}} {{made during}} the past 10 years are reviewed. Intracellular recording {{has made it possible}} to state absolute values for the cardiac resting potential (90 mv., inside negative to outside) and the "overshoot " during activity (30 mv., inside positive to outside). The surface membrane of a resting fiber is considered to be predominately permeable to K ions. During activity, Na conductance increases and K conductance decreases. The latter process is thought to be essential for explaining the high membrane resistance that is measured during the long-lasting "plateau " found with cardiac muscle. A hypothesis is presented that would account for the termination of the plateau and the beginning of repolarization. IFT IS THE PLAN of the present survey to begin with a description of the elec-trical events during cardiac activity; to con-tinue with their interpretation in terms of the movements of ions; and to close by treat-ing a more special problem: the possible rea-sons for the long-lasting action potential that is typical for cardiac muscle. Intracellular Recording It was in 1949 that Ling and Gerard, 1 working in Chicago, described a new tool that stimulated electrophysiologic research in al-most all its branches: the capillary microelec-trode.

40|$|Since {{ancient times}} {{intellectual}} work has required tools for writing, documents for reading, and bibliographies for finding, {{not to mention}} more specialized techniques and technologies. Direct personal discussion is often impractical and we depend on documents instead. Document technology evolved through writing, printing, telecommunications, copying, and computing and facilitated an ‘information flood’ which motivated important knowledge organization initiatives, especially {{in the nineteenth century}} (library science, bibliography, documentation). Electronics and the Internet amplified these trends. As an example we consider an initiative to provide shared access to the working notes of editors preparing scholarly editions of historically important texts. For the future, we can project trends leading to ubiquitous recording, pervasive representations, simultaneous interaction regardless of geography, and powerful analysis and visualization of the records resulting from that ubiquitous recording. This evolving situation has implications for publishing, archival practice, and knowledge organization. The passing of time is of special interest in knowledge organization because knowing is cultural, living, and always changing. Technique and technology are also cultural (“material culture”) but fixed and inanimate, {{as can be seen in}} the obsolescence of subject headings, which remain as inscribed while culture moves on. The tension between the benefits of technology and the limitations imposed by fixity in a changing world provide a central tension in knowledge organization over time.
