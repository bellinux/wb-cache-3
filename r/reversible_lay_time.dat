Therefore, the cutting process {{is one of the}} main value adding processes. Several functions are included in the cutting process; namely fabric laying, cutting and bundling of cut panels. Since other processes are depended on the fabric laying, it plays a crucial role. This study attempts to develop a model to determine the fabric <b>laying</b> <b>time</b> of Gerber machines used in the cutting department. First the factors that affect to the <b>lay</b> <b>time</b> are identified. The actual times taken for each of these factors are collected for non-woven trouser patterns for a period of month totaling 89 data points. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis are used to analyze the data. Overall, the results show that six factors out of identified seven are significantly useful in predicting total <b>lay</b> <b>time.</b> Particularly, the results of the regression analysis indicate that at a α= 0. 01 level of significance, loading time, damage check time...|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000246297100003 International audienceReproduction is {{generally}} controlled by important temporal constraints involving complex adaptive mechanisms. Birds, in temperate zones, present marked breeding seasonality {{as well as}} marked daily organization of reproductive behavior, especially laying. Intra-specific variability and determinants of this pattern have been investigated mainly in domestic non-passerine birds. The present study analyzed the daily temporal organization of laying in a free-living species, the European starling, Sturnus vulgaris. Breeding in a starling colony was monitored for five consecutive years using a non-invasive method (infrared video camera) to precisely estimate <b>laying</b> <b>times.</b> European starlings present a marked daily laying rhythm, ovipositions occurring only during a morning species-specific temporal window. Inside this <b>laying</b> window, <b>time</b> intervals between successive eggs varied greatly among females. Contrary to many species, the light/dark cycle {{did not appear to}} control <b>laying</b> <b>time</b> in European starlings, but daily variations of the ultraviolet composition of the solar spectrum appeared to be a possible Zeitgeber of this behavior...|$|R
30|$|The term ‘tramp {{shipping}} optimisation’ {{refers to}} the use of OR to maximise the revenue or minimise the cost of a tramp shipping problem, subject to the limited shipping resources. One such tramp shipping problem exists when there are some ships and some cargoes and it is required to find out the cargo mix assigned to each ship voyage which maximises total gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity and cargo <b>time</b> window (<b>lay</b> can). Name this problem area ‘optimisation of ship voyage’. To give more details on this area, consider the following facts. Unlike ‘optimisation in liner shipping’, both ports of call and port calling sequence are here assumed optional. Charter party, signed by the ship owner and the charterer, usually specifies terms and clauses to be followed by both parties. Non-demise voyage charter parties are assumed here. Terms generally include the following items: calling ports, calling sequence, cargo freight, cargo <b>time</b> window (<b>lay</b> can), allowable cargo handling <b>time</b> (<b>lay</b> days), dispatch count if actual days are less than lay days, and demurrage count if more. Loading and discharging lay days may be considered in reversible or irreversible manner. If <b>reversible,</b> <b>lay</b> days are specified for loading and discharging collectively. If irreversible, lay days are specified for loading and discharging separately. The gross terms of voyage charter party are here assumed unless otherwise specified. Before cargoes are being fixed by the ship owner, ‘optimisation of ship voyage’ helps in proposing a voyage plan suggesting an optimal cargo mix for each ship. This mix maximises the sum of voyage gross profit per day for all ships, subject to ship capacity, cargo lay can, and other voyage charter party terms. In the cargo mix selection, the random nature of sea transport demand has to be considered.|$|R

40|$|The rupture {{directivity}} for the 2004 Sumatra earthquake is {{analyzed by}} examining {{differences between the}} phase-de <b>lay</b> <b>times</b> of Rayleigh-waves (in the 140 - 160 sec period range) arising from the main shock and reference earth quakes. A long source-process time (~ 463. 0 sec) and large rupture length (~ 1164. 0 km) are de rived from this analysis of rupture directivity. The source-process time for this earth quake is larger than for either the 1960 Chile or 1964 Alaska earth quakes. This {{might be due to}} the length of the rupture that occurred during earth quake faulting. The estimated rise time for the 2004 Sumatra earthquake, 92. 0 sec, is approximately 20 % of the whole source duration and also larger than those for the 1960 Chile and 1964 Alaska earth quakes. This likely reflects a fundamental difference between the frictional properties of these earth quakes. When the rise time is taken into ac count, an estimated rupture velocity of approximately 3. 1 km sec- 1 is obtained. This value is higher than that found in previous studies carried out on the basis of hydro acoustic data and regional seismic net works. In this study, we obtain additional evidence from analysis of the surface-wave phase-de <b>lay</b> <b>time</b> which con firms the basic features of the rupturing of the 2004 Sumatra earth quake.

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} with Muscovy ducks to study the influence of age and <b>laying</b> <b>time</b> on their egg quality. In addition the relationship between egg water loss during storage, shell thickness and storage time were tested. a total of 2920 eggs were collected and individually weighed, washed, fumigated and stored for a maximum period of 7 days. Then the eggs were incubated and candled on the 10 th day. All the shell obtained from unfertile eggs (10 th day), died embryo eggs (10 th and 30 th day) and hatched eggs (34 th day), were immediately cleaned by washing and dried in a forced draught stove. Individual egg measurements included: egg weight at collection and at incubation, shell weight and shell thickness. Shell weight per unit of egg surface area (SWUSA), water loss per unit of time, avg. shell thickness and percentage of shell on egg weight were calculated. Results obtained in this study show that the duck egg stored at 11 +- 0. 2 °C and R. H. 70 - 75 % loose 0. 03 g of water for each day of storage (P< 0. 001). Hatching rate is affected (P< 0. 05) by water loss during storage period and the best results (70. 34 %) are obtained when water loss per week is about 1 % of egg weight. Shell thickness, weight, percentage of shell on egg weight and SWUSA are significantly affected by <b>laying</b> <b>time</b> and age of bird (P< 0. 01). these parameters tend to decrease {{with the passing of}} laying -period and age of bird. A relationship between hatching outcome and shell weight percentage of shell on egg weight and SWUSA was observed (P< 0. 01). Moreover results showed that although shell weight increases with increasing egg weight (b=+ 0. 82), it does not do so proportionally, consequently there is concomitant decrease in percentage of shell on egg weight (b= - 0. 028) ...|$|R
