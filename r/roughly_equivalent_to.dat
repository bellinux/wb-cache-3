5|$|At Unicamp, {{academic}} {{studies are}} usually {{divided into four}} main areas: exact sciences (which includes formal and physical sciences), human sciences (<b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> social science, including Arts), biological sciences (<b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> life sciences) and technologies (including engineering and technical studies). This division reflects on how the university are structured how the campuses was designed.|$|E

5|$|A 2009 {{national}} survey of drug use by the US Department of Health and Human Services concluded {{that the number of}} first-time psilocybin mushroom users in the United States was <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> the number of first-time users of cannabis. In European countries, the lifetime prevalence estimates of psychedelic mushroom usage among young adults (15–34 years) range from 0.3% to 14.1%.|$|E

50|$|The stellar {{wind from}} this supergiant is {{expelling}} matter {{from the star}} {{at the rate of}} 1.55 × 10−6 solar masses per year, or <b>roughly</b> the <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> the Sun's mass every 640,000 years.|$|R
5000|$|The opal is {{just under}} 5,000 carats; <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> in size <b>to</b> two cricket balls. Although rough-cut, it is {{polished}} on two sides.|$|R
5|$|Also {{aiding the}} B-1's {{survivability}} is its relatively low radar cross-section (RCS). Although not technically a stealth aircraft {{in a comprehensive}} sense, thanks to the aircraft's structure, serpentine intake paths and use of radar-absorbent material its RCS is about 1/50th of the similar sized B-52's RCS; this is about 26ft² or 2.4m², <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> the RCS of a small fighter aircraft.|$|E
5|$|There is {{also much}} {{information}} about how the universe was thought to work stored in the mythology of the constellations. The Barasana of the Amazon plan part of their annual cycle based on observation of the stars. When their constellation of the Caterpillar-Jaguar (<b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> the modern Scorpius) falls they prepare to catch the pupating caterpillars of the forest as they fall from the trees. The caterpillars provide food at a season when other foods are scarce.|$|E
5|$|His brother Joseph, who was 24 years older, {{acted as}} a {{surrogate}} father and encouraged Jefferson in his education. Two years later, Davis entered the Catholic school of Saint Thomas at St. Rose Priory, a school operated by the Dominican Order in Washington County, Kentucky. At the time, {{he was the only}} Protestant student at the school. In 1818 Davis returned to Mississippi, studying at Jefferson College at Washington. Three years later in 1821, he returned to Kentucky, where he studied at Transylvania University in Lexington. (At the time, these colleges were like academies, <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> high schools.) His father Samuel died on July 4, 1824, when Jefferson was 16 years old.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> terms <b>to</b> Hochschule {{are used}} in some other European {{countries}}, such as högskola in Scandinavia, and [...] (literally [...] "main school") in Hungary, {{as well as in}} post-Soviet countries (deriving from высшее учебное заведение), in Central Europe, in Bulgaria (висше училище) and Romania.|$|R
50|$|Gunpowder {{fantasy is}} {{generally}} {{set in a}} world with <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> technology <b>to</b> {{the world in the}} 17th through 19th centuries, particularly the latter eras. Typically, gunpowder fantasy also includes elements of real-world technology such as steam power, telegraphy and in some cases early telephones or combustion engines.|$|R

5|$|In 1755, Kościuszko began {{attending}} school in Lyubeshiv, but never finished {{due to his}} family's financial straits after his father's death in 1758. Poland's King Stanisław August Poniatowski established a Corps of Cadets (Korpus Kadetów) in 1765, at what is now Warsaw University, to educate military officers and government officials. Kościuszko enrolled in the Corps on December 18, 1765, likely thanks to the patronage of the Czartoryski family. The school emphasized military subjects and the liberal arts, and after graduating on December 20, 1766, Kościuszko was promoted to chorąży (a military rank <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> modern lieutenant); he stayed on as a student instructor and by 1768 had attained the rank of captain.|$|E
5|$|In late August, the 7th Battalion, with a {{frontage}} {{equal to}} just over half its authorised strength, was transferred to Ypres, in Belgium, where they manned trenches near the Ypres–Commines canal. During this time they {{were not involved in}} any major attacks, however, each night they sent patrols out into no man's land and established listening posts to gather intelligence. On 30 September, the 7th Battalion, along with its sister battalion, the 8th Battalion, mounted a raid on the German line at Hollebeke with a force <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> two platoons. The raid was a great success, with the Australians overwhelming the defenders and capturing a section of the German line and killing up to 13 Germans, before withdrawing.|$|E
5|$|Lichen-like fossils {{have been}} found in the Doushantuo Formation in {{southern}} China dating back to 635–551Ma. Lichens formed a component of the early terrestrial ecosystems, and the estimated age of the oldest terrestrial lichen fossil is 400Ma; this date corresponds to the age of the oldest known sporocarp fossil, a Paleopyrenomycites species found in the Rhynie Chert. The oldest fossil with microscopic features resembling modern-day basidiomycetes is Palaeoancistrus, found permineralized with a fern from the Pennsylvanian. Rare in the fossil record are the Homobasidiomycetes (a taxon <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> the mushroom-producing species of the Agaricomycetes). Two amber-preserved specimens provide evidence that the earliest known mushroom-forming fungi (the extinct species Archaeomarasmius leggetti) appeared during the late Cretaceous, 90Ma.|$|E
25|$|Japan {{manufactured}} 89 AH-1S Cobras {{which were}} licensed by Fuji Heavy Industries from 1984 to 2000. The type {{is used by}} the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force, and are Step 3 models, which are <b>roughly</b> the <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> the United States Army's AH-1Fs. The engine is the T53-K-703 turboshaft, which Kawasaki Heavy Industries produced under license.|$|R
50|$|Bezirksamtmann (plural Bezirksamtleute) is a German {{administrative}} {{title of}} gubernatorial or lower rank, <b>roughly</b> translating as <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> the British District Officer. It {{is derived from}} Bezirk ("district") + Amtmann ("official").|$|R
40|$|General EcologyPost-glacial {{topographic}} {{features are}} an integral part of northern Michigan geography. This study utilizes two predominantly aspen forest sites of <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> age <b>to</b> examine differences between moraine and outwash plant communities. We found significantly higher tree diameter, species richness, soil moisture, and canopy coverage at the moraine site. Suspected reasons for this variation include the presence of underlying clay in the moraine which may cause the increased moisture content...|$|R
5|$|The 169Yb isotope (with a {{half-life}} of 32 days), {{which is}} created {{along with the}} short-lived 175Yb isotope (half-life 4.2 days) by neutron activation during the irradiation of ytterbium in nuclear reactors, {{has been used as}} a radiation source in portable X-ray machines. Like X-rays, the gamma rays emitted by the source pass through soft tissues of the body, but are blocked by bones and other dense materials. Thus, small 169Yb samples (which emit gamma rays) act like tiny X-ray machines useful for radiography of small objects. Experiments show that radiographs taken with a 169Yb source are <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> those taken with X-rays having energies between 250 and 350keV. 169Yb is also used in nuclear medicine.|$|E
5|$|After Hearst {{conveyed}} {{his enthusiasm}} for the project, Beloso sold Byne the stones for $85,000, including the cloister, the chapter house, the refectory and the dormitory for novices. With Byne's commission, Hearst was to pay $97,000, a price <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> $ as of 20. Byne started immediately on the project, organizing men and materials, and beginning the removal of stones. Hearst's main architect Julia Morgan sent her associate architect Walter T. Steilberg who arrived on March 9, 1931. Steilberg recommended that Hearst buy the old church portal, which he did, at Byne's price of $1,500. Under the direction of Byne and Steilberg, the monastery was carefully labeled as it was dismantled stone by stone. Antonio Gomez, the local foreman praised by Byne and Steilberg, numbered the blocks on architectural drawings and painted the number in red {{on the back of}} each stone.|$|E
5|$|Day and Foxe {{completed}} a second {{edition of the}} Book of Martyrs in 1570. It was even larger than the first—a total of 2,300 pages in two enormous folio volumes—and at one point, Day ran out of paper (which he imported) and had to paste smaller sheets together to make do. This edition received official recognition: William Cecil and the Privy Council directed the church to ensure that copies were available to parishioners, and in 1571, the Convocation ordered that every cathedral church and the household of every {{senior member of the}} clergy should own a copy. The edition has been recorded as costing sixteen shillings, <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> two months' wages for a skilled London clothworker at the time.|$|E
5000|$|Between maid: <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> {{in status}} <b>to</b> scullery maids, and often paid less, the between maids {{in a large}} {{household}} waited on the senior servants (butler, housekeeper, and cook) and were therefore answerable to all three department heads, often leading to friction in their employment.|$|R
30|$|The {{benchmarking}} method {{based on}} actual output is robust to dispatching model variations, so the emission balance of each GenCos is <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> and easy <b>to</b> predict. On the other hand, it {{may reduce the}} participants’ trading enthusiasm in the emission market, affecting that market’s liquidity.|$|R
5000|$|August (hazuki or hachigatsu), September (nagatsuki or kugatsu) and October (jūgatsu or kannazuki). The ninth month (kugatsu) in the Japanese {{calendar}} is <b>equivalent</b> <b>roughly</b> <b>to</b> October in the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, {{the end of}} September (kugatsujin) is <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> end {{of autumn}} (kure no aki).|$|R
5|$|During {{its initial}} release the film earned $33.6 million in North American theater rentals (the distributor's {{share of the}} box office), {{generating}} approximately $74.7 million in box office sales. Outside of North America, it earned $32.5 million in rentals (about $72.2 million at the box office) for a worldwide total of $66.1 million in rental earnings, <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> $146.9 million in box office receipts. It was the fastest-grossing film {{as well as the}} highest-grossing film of 1959, in the process becoming the second-highest-grossing film of all-time (at that time) behind Gone with the Wind. Ben-Hur saved MGM from financial disaster, making a profit of $20,409,000 on its initial release, and another $10.1 million in profits when re-released in 1969. By 1989, Ben-Hur had earned $90 million in worldwide theatrical rentals.|$|E
5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option {{for those who do not}} respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> that of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the surface}} of the Earth, its {{magnetic}} field can be closely approximated by the field of a magnetic dipole positioned {{at the center of the}} Earth and tilted at an angle of about 11° with respect to the rotational axis of the Earth. The dipole is <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> a powerful bar magnet, with its south pole pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole. This may seem surprising, but the north pole of a magnet is so defined because, if allowed to rotate freely, it points roughly northward (in the geographic sense). Since the north pole of a magnet attracts the south poles of other magnets and repels the north poles, it must be attracted to the south pole of Earth's magnet. The dipolar field accounts for 80–90% of the field in most locations.|$|E
40|$|Archived sera (collected in 1946) from {{acute rheumatic fever}} (ARF) and {{untreated}} {{scarlet fever}} and/or pharyngitis patients were reacted with streptococcal M protein, cardiac myosin, and cardiac tropomyosin. Except for very low levels to tropomyosin, antibodies to other antigens were not elevated in the sera of ARF patients relative to those of non-ARF patients, {{even though there was}} <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> exposure <b>to</b> group A streptococci. This suggests that antibodies to these molecules may not {{play a central role in}} the induction of ARF...|$|R
5000|$|The {{proposed}} {{school was}} to be six-form entry and <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> in capacity <b>to</b> Holland Park School which invited comparisons. Holland Park has 23,392 sqm. of externl play space, Kensington Academy has 3,881 sqm of external space which includes the delivery bay and the approach road. Much of the external space is on the roofs.|$|R
5000|$|February (kisaragi or nigatsu), March (yayoi or sangatsu) and April (uzuki or shigatsu). The fourth month (shigatsu) in the Japanese {{calendar}} is <b>equivalent</b> <b>roughly</b> <b>to</b> April in the Gregorian calendar. Therefore, {{the end of}} March (yayoijin) is <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> the end {{of spring}} (haru no hate).|$|R
5|$|The Yorkshire {{line of the}} de Brus family {{died out}} {{with the death of}} the childless Peter IV de Brus in 1272 but the priory was still patronised by the local nobility. The Fauconberg and Thweng families, who married Peter's sisters Agnes and Lucia, took over the {{patronage}} which continued for several centuries. Many prominent local nobles were buried there, as was the Scottish Robert V de Brus, grandfather of King Robert the Bruce. At least nine patrons and their families were buried in the priory between 1295 and 1411. The priory received substantial financial support from its patrons; in 1381 William, Lord Latimer provided funds to complete the north nave and donated £333 6s 8d (<b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> £1.6million today) for a new belfry. He left the priory cattle from his manor at Ugthorpe, bequeathed a range of religious items, and made arrangements for his body to be interred there on his death.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the drug begin 10–40minutes after ingestion, and last 2–6hours {{depending}} on dose, species, and individual metabolism. The half life of psilocybin is 163±64minutes when taken orally, or 74.1±19.6minutes when injected intravenously. A dosage of 4–10mg, corresponding roughly to 50–300micrograms per kilogram (µg/kg) of body weight, is required to induce psychedelic effects. A typical recreational dosage is 10–50mg psilocybin, which is <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> 10–50grams of fresh mushrooms, or 1–5grams of dried mushrooms. A {{small number of people}} are unusually sensitive to psilocybin, such that a normally threshold-level dose of about 2mg can result in effects usually associated with medium or high doses. In contrast, there are some who require relatively high doses to experience noticeable effects. Individual brain chemistry and metabolism play a large role in determining a person's response to psilocybin.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{insurance system}} devised by McGivney gave a deceased Knight's widow a $1,000 death benefit. Each member was assessed $1 upon a death, {{and when the}} number of Knights grew beyond 1,000, the assessment decreased according to the rate of increase. Each member, regardless of age, was assessed equally. As a result, younger, healthier members could expect to pay more over the course of their lifetimes than those men who joined when they were older. There was also a Sick Benefit Deposit for members who fell ill and could not work. Each sick Knight was entitled to draw up to $5 a week for 13 weeks (<b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> $125.75 in 2009 dollars). If he remained sick after that, the council to which he belonged determined the sum of money given to him.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{divisions}} {{were formed}} from {{two or more}} other divisions, and many were not active at the same time. The number of active divisions, {{at the start of}} the war in 1937, was about 170 NRA divisions. The average NRA division had 4,000–5,000 troops. A Chinese army was <b>roughly</b> the <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> a Japanese division in terms of manpower but the Chinese forces largely lacked artillery, heavy weapons, and motorized transport.|$|R
5000|$|Kalibata is {{noteworthy}} as {{the location of}} the Kalibata Cemetery or [...] "Heroes' Cemetery", where veterans of the Indonesian National Revolution and other prominent people are buried - including National Heroes of Indonesia - <b>roughly</b> the Indonesian <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> the American Arlington National Cemetery.|$|R
25|$|Three {{species have}} been identified. P. lakustai, from the Wapiti Formation, the bonebed horizon of which is <b>roughly</b> <b>equivalent</b> age <b>to</b> the upper Bearpaw and lower Horseshoe Canyon Formations, {{is known to have}} existed from about 73.5-72.5 million years ago. P. canadensis is younger, known only from the lower Horseshoe Canyon Formation, about 71.5-71 Ma ago. Fossils of the {{youngest}} species, P. perotorum, have been recovered from the Prince Creek Formation of Alaska, and date to 70-69 million years ago. The presence of three known species makes this genus the most speciose among the centrosaurines.|$|R
