5|$|From {{the moment}} Thriller was released, it set the {{standard}} for the music industry: artists, record labels, producers, marketers and even choreographers. The music video was ahead of its time and it is considered a monumental one—not only in Jackson's career, but also in the history of pop music. Epic Records' approach to creating a song and video that would appeal to the mass market ended up influencing the way that professionals now market and release their songs. John Landis's production of a mini-movie, rather than the usual short music video, would <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> for other directors and producers.|$|E

500|$|Halo 3: ODST {{garnered}} generally positive reviews, {{and holds}} {{an average of}} 83/100 on aggregate web site Metacritic. Times Lev Grossman wrote ODST was a [...] "milestone" [...] as it proved [...] "Bungie can use the same instrument to play in totally different key," [...] adding to the longevity of the Halo franchise. In contrast, Pete Metzger of the Los Angeles Times wrote that although ODST was a good game with a compelling story, action, and graphics, [...] "the {{same can be said}} for nearly every first-person shooter that is released these days" [...] and that ODST failed to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> set by previous Halo games. [...] 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish noted that while ODST had its flaws, its greatest success was bringing together players who preferred either the multiplayer or campaign portions with a game that would satisfy both camps.|$|E
500|$|Charlie Collier, the {{president}} of AMC, stated that it was [...] "a good day to be dead. We are so proud of this series, its depth of storytelling and the remarkable talent attached.

[...] Senior Vice President Joel Stillerman ascribed that much of its success came from the storytelling presented in the episode; [...] "The Walking Dead is that rare piece of programming that works on so many levels. It is legitimately great storytelling that is not only highly entertaining, but incredibly thought provoking as well. People who are familiar with the comic books know what's coming, but suffice it to say, this is only the beginning of a long, intense, and powerful ride. Long live The Walking Dead." ...|$|E
500|$|Halo 3 {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} upon its release. It holds {{an average of}} 93.53% and 94/100 on aggregate web sites GameRankings and Metacritic. Pro-Gs Wesley Yin-Poole assured readers that Halo 3 {{lived up to the}} enormous hype surrounding it, writing that the game was [...] "everything we hoped it would be, and much, much, more". Reviewers including Eurogamers Rob Fahey, GamesRadar's Charlie Barrett, and GameSpot's Jeff Gerstmann felt that the underlying formula of previous Halo games was unchanged, but {{that this was not a}} detriment. [...] "Every type of Halo fan, from the hardcore to the casual to the brand new, will find something to satisfy them in Master Chief's third adventure," [...] Barrett asserted, [...] while IGN's Hilary Goldstein referred to Halo 3 as [...] "the most complete game available on any console", specifically stating [...] "the Forge and the replay functionality <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> for console shooters so high, it may never be surpassed this generation." [...] The gameplay additions to the game, such as equipment and new vehicles, were praised; Gerstmann and Goldstein noted that equipment had much more relevance in multiplayer matches than the campaign.|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Early Winter" [...] {{was directed by}} Stefani's frequent collaborator Sophie Muller, who had previously directed the music videos of [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Wind It Up". Filming of the music video took place at destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague, where Stefani had been touring during The Sweet Escape Tour in October 2007. It opens with a black-and-white scene of Stefani {{lying on the ground}} in a long white gown. In the next scene, Stefani is shown walking on the street under red street lights and then holds her love interest, played by her tour backup dancer Steelo Vazquez, against the wall and talks to him. The scene then changes to Stefani walking on a street and later walking into the railway station. In the next scene, Stefani is seen singing under falling red-coloured feathers in a huge palace-type hall. Scenes of Stefani staring {{at herself in the mirror}} with her hair up and snow falling slowly down, with the lights turning on and off intermittently, are interspersed throughout the video. Stefani is also seen sitting on the ground and singing while crying. She is then shown at a railway station walking besides a moving train. The video ends with Stefani running out of the hall. Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy praised the video for being [...] "acutely artful, immeasurably stylish" [...] and commented that [...] "Gwen’s managed to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> on her own superlatively supreme style in her new video." ...|$|E
500|$|Character shading {{supervisor}} on {{the film}} Thomas Jordan explained that chrome and car paint were the main challenges {{on the film}}, saying: [...] "Chrome and car paint were our two main challenges on this film. We started out by learning {{as much as we}} could. At the local body shop, we watched them paint a car, and we saw the way they mixed the paint and applied the various coats. We tried to dissect what goes into the real paint and recreated it in the computer. We figured out that we needed a base paint, which is where the color comes from, and the clearcoat, which provides the reflection. We were then able to add in things like metallic flake to give it a glittery sparkle, a pearlescent quality the might change color depending on the angle, and even a layer of pin-striping for characters like Ramone." [...] Supervising technical director on the film Eben Ostby explained that the biggest challenge for the technical team was creating the metallic and painted surfaces of the car characters, and the reflections that those surfaces generate, saying: [...] "Given that the stars of our film are made of metal, John had a real desire to see realistic reflections, and more beautiful lighting than we’ve seen in any of our previous films. In the past, we’ve mostly used environment maps and other matte-based technology to cheat reflections, but for Cars we added a ray-tracing capability to our existing Renderman program to <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> for Pixar." ...|$|E
500|$|The Sleeping Dragon {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} most critics and sold {{a few hundred}} thousand copies. eToychest gave the game a 5 out of 5, saying [...] "Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon is a shining example of what this genre is capable of, and it comes as close to perfection as any recent adventure game has." [...] Just Adventure gave the game an A+, saying: [...] "A triumph. It’s {{at the same time a}} real 3D game and a crackerjack pure adventure. High levels of craftsmanship and designer TLC are evident throughout the game. Playing it is like falling into an exciting movie thriller." [...] Gaming Chronicles gave it a 9.2 out of 10, saying that [...] "adventure gaming is alive and well thanks to designers like Revolution" [...] and that it's a stunning achievement in interactive entertainment, praising its story, characters, visuals, and dialogue, and calling it a [...] "must-own title for anyone looking to relive the golden era of adventure gaming"; they did, however, indicate that the controls were too easy at times. Edge magazine gave the game a 9, praising the storytelling, dialogues and visuals, and while pointing out some sporadic glitches that break the illusion Edge magazine refers to this game as [...] "a fairytale comeback" [...] and [...] "the adventure's glorious return". IGN gave the game a rating of 8.4, placing it under the [...] "Impressive" [...] category, but noted that the interface was difficult to use and the puzzles in the game were repetitive. Adventure Gamers gave it 4 out of 5 stars, called it a [...] "technical masterpiece", and praised its cinematic introduction, cutscenes, lifelike character faces, and said [...] "it certainly <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> for any seen in adventures to this date", but criticised its controls and repetitive puzzles. GameSpot had an overall positive review; their Scott Osborne praised its plot, characters, and setting, and (unlike most) found the interface to have its points, although he was frustrated with times in which quick reflexes are required and bored (like most) with some of the puzzles; he also ran into a sound problem, which does not appear to have happened to any other reviewer. Although Laura MacDonald of Mr. Bill's Adventureland panned its repetitive puzzles, she called it an [...] "instant classic" [...] and praised its story, controls, characters and music. Steven Carter of Game Over Online was less positive (criticising its plot, interface, and puzzles calling most of the last [...] "trivially easy"), but did praise its general appearance, voice acting, and music. Computer Games Magazine was less positive, mainly due to heavily criticising the interface.|$|E
