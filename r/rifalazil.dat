5000|$|<b>Rifalazil</b> (also {{known as}} KRM-1648 and AMI-1648) is an antibiotic. <b>Rifalazil</b> kills {{bacterial}} cells by blocking off the β-subunit in RNA polymerase. [...] <b>Rifalazil</b> {{is used as}} treatments for many different diseases. Of the most common are Chlamydia infection, Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD), and tuberculosis (TB). Using <b>rifalazil</b> and the effects that coincide with taking <b>rifalazil</b> for treating a bacterial disease vary from person to person, as does any drug put into the human body.

50|$|<b>Rifalazil</b> {{works well}} alone, and in {{conjunction}} with other antibiotics alone. In a study conducted in 2005, it was found that combining <b>rifalazil</b> with vancomycin increased bacterial killing by a factor of 3. <b>Rifalazil</b> also has a very long half-life which allows more infrequent dosages as opposed to frequent small dosages of antibiotics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rifalazil</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} to treat cases of tuberculosis and chlamydia. It is very good treatment for tuberculosis because <b>rifalazil</b> achieves very high concentration in the blood cells and the lungs. In addition, <b>rifalazil</b> is becoming more widely used {{because it can be}} used along with many other indications, such as HIV, TB, and MRSA. <b>Rifalazil</b> has a very long half-life which is very useful for certain medications. The drug is administered orally which is also convenient in terms of drug administration. A longer half-life allows for few treatments and dosage which makes this an up-and-coming drug for tuberculosis, CDAD, and chlamydia. Although the uses for <b>rifalazil</b> seem very effective, there are negative side effects which make the use limited. <b>Rifalazil</b> interacts with other drugs and on top of that, rapid resistance develops to other drugs.|$|E

Specifically, 0. 002 μg/ml <b>rifalazil</b> incubated for 1 day with a monolayer of McCoy cells was sufficient to protect against a challenge 2 days later with Chlamydia trachomatis serovar D (UW- 3). The PE was observed with five different mammalian cell lines and {{with a variety of}} C. trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae isolates. The duration of the PE was 6 to 12 days for <b>rifalazil</b> (depending on the cell line), a maximum of 3 days for azithromycin, and less than a day for the other drugs tested. For <b>rifalazil,</b> the PE was shown to be mediated by inhibition of the chlamydial RNA polymerase since mutants with altered RNA polymerases had correspondingly altered PEs.

We have compared the antioxidant properties of <b>rifalazil</b> to those of rifampin, a drug well known in this context, by using cellular and acellular oxidant-generating systems. Oxidant production by polymorphonuclear neutrophils was measured in terms of cytochrome c reduction, lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence (Lu-ACL), and the 2 ′, 7 ′-dichlorofluorescin diacetate H 2 (DCFDA-H 2) technique (intracellular oxidant production). <b>Rifalazil</b> impaired O 2 − production in a concentration-dependent manner, with 50 % inhibitory concentrations (IC 50) (concentrations which inhibit 50 % of the response) of 5. 4 (30 and 60 min of incubation) and 6. 4 (30 min) mg/liter, respectively, for phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) stimulation. In agreement with the published fMLP-like activity of rifampin, the inhibitory effect of rifampin was significantly greater for fMLP (IC 50 of 5. 6 mg/liter) than for PMA (IC 50 of 58 mg/liter) stimulation. Alteration of intracellular oxidant production was also observed with IC 50 values similar to those obtained by the cytochrome assay. In addition, <b>rifalazil</b> and rifampin (≥ 25 mg/liter) scavenged O 2 −, as demonstrated by the acellular (hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase) system.

40|$|<b>Rifalazil,</b> {{also known}} as KRM- 1648 or benzoxazino{{rifamycin}}, is a new semisynthetic rifamycin with a long half-life of approximately 60 h. <b>Rifalazil</b> has potent bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in vitro and in animal models of tuberculosis (TB). Prior studies in healthy volunteers showed that once-weekly doses of 25 to 50 mg of <b>rifalazil</b> were well tolerated. In this randomized, open-label, active-controlled phase II clinical trial, 65 subjects with sputum smear-positive pulmonary TB received {{one of the following}} regimens for the first 2 weeks of therapy: 16 subjects received isoniazid (INH) (5 mg/kg of body weight) daily; 16 received INH (5 mg/kg) and rifampin (10 mg/kg) daily; 17 received INH (5 mg/kg) daily plus 10 mg of <b>rifalazil</b> once weekly; and 16 received INH (5 mg/kg) daily and 25 mg of <b>rifalazil</b> once weekly. All subjects were then put on 6 months of standard TB therapy. Pretreatment and day 15 sputum CFU of M. tuberculosis were measured to assess the bactericidal activity of each regimen. The number of drug-related adverse experiences was low and not significantly different among treatment arms. A transient decrease in absolute neutrophil count to less than 2, 000 cells/mm 3 was detected in 10 to 20 % of patients in the rifalazil- and rifampin-containing treatment arms without clinical consequences. Decreases in CFU counts were comparable among the four treatment arms; however, the CFU results were statistically inconclusive due to the variability in the control arms.

C. trachomatis developed resistance to both antimicrobials within six passages, with higher level resistance to rifampin (128 to 256 μg/ml) and lower level resistance to <b>rifalazil</b> (0. 5 to 1 μg/ml).

Hamsters received by gavage for 5 days vehicle, vancomycin (50 mg/kg), or <b>rifalazil</b> (20 mg/kg) either simultaneously with (prophylactic protocol) or 24 h after C. difficile administration (treatment protocol). While all vehicle-administered animals became moribund within 48 h of C. difficile administration, no rifalazil- or vancomycin-treated animals in either protocol showed signs of morbidity after 7 days. Ceca of rifalazil-treated animals showed absence of epithelial cell damage, significantly reduced congestion and edema, and less, but not statistically significantly less, neutrophil infiltration compared to those of vehicle-treated animals. In contrast, vancomycin-treated animals demonstrated severe epithelial cell damage and mildly reduced congestion and edema. Moreover, hamsters relapsed and tested C. difficile toxin positive (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) 10 to 15 days after discontinuation of vancomycin treatment.

In every instance where an elevation in the MIC occurred, one or more mutations in the rpoB gene, encoding the rifampin binding site, were detected. With one exception, all rpoB mutants that contained a single mutation conferred lower levels of resistance than mutants containing multiple mutations. Some rpoB mutations conferred very high levels of resistance to rifampin, up to 512 μg/ml. In all cases, mutants remained susceptible to concentrations of <b>rifalazil</b> at or below 0. 064 μg/ml.

40|$|International audienceThe first {{antibiotic}} of the ansamycin family, rifampicin (RIF), {{was isolated}} in 1959 and was introduced into therapy in 1962; {{it is still}} a first-line agent in the treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis, leprosy and various biofilm-related infections. The antimicrobial activity of RIF is due to its inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). Most frequently, bacteria become resistant to RIF through mutation of the target; however, this mechanism is not unique. Other mechanisms of resistance have been reported, such as duplication of the target, action of RNAP-binding proteins, modification of RIF and modification of cell permeability. We suggest that several of these alternative resistance strategies could reflect the ecological function of RIF, such as autoregulation and/or signalling to surrounding microorganisms. Very often, resistance mechanisms found in the clinic have an environmental origin.

40|$|Rifampin (a semi-synthetic {{rifamycin}} derivative) {{is one of}} the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Rifampin inhibits transcription by binding to the beta-subunit of the RNA polymerase (RNAP). The {{majority of}} the clinically-relevant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) rifamycin-resistant (RifR) mutations result from amino acid substitutions of one of the following three beta residues: Asp 435, His 445, and Ser 450 in a highly conserved 27 amino acid region of the RNAP beta-subunit. The core subunits of wild-type and RifR mutants (Asp 435 Val, His 445 Tyr, Ser 450 Leu) of MTB RNAP were overexpressed in and purified from E. coli. The rifamycins were all found to bind tightly (IC 50) to the wild-type MTB and E. coli RNAPs, whereas dramatic (~ 10 ^ 2 - 10 ^ 5 fold) losses of affinity for rifamycins were observed for the RifR mutants from both bacteria. Additional studies with efflux pump-deficient E. coli (EC 2880) confirm that the differential sensitivity of MTB and E. coli to rifamycin antibiotic activity is due to rifamycin efflux from E. coli, rather than any differences in the target RNAPs. The activities of C- 8 modified rifamycins are consistent with X-ray crystal structures that show Ser 450 acting as a hydrogen bond donor to the C- 8 hydroxyl of rifamycins and that rifamycin resistance in the Ser 450 mutants is likely due to loss of this hydrogen bond and loss of affinity. A series of novel benzoxazinorifamycin analogues displayed superior affinity toward wild-type and RifR mutants of the MTB RNAP than rifampin and <b>rifalazil</b> (RifR mutants, but not WT), but the IC 50 values were still in the 10 ^- 6 M range with the RifR MTB RNAPs. Rifampin exhibits significant drug-drug interactions via potent induction of cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 (CYP 3 A 4). Selected commercially available rifamycins and our synthetic analogues were screened in the human pregnane X receptor (hPXR) activation assay to determine their extents of hPXR activation as an indicator of potential for CYP 3 A 4 induction. One of our analogues exhibited very low (similar to <b>rifalazil)</b> activation of hPXR, while the others did show significant activation and some cytotoxicity. The results of these studies have provided encouraging evidence that rifamycins with improved activity against RifR MTB RNAP and lower drug-drug interaction liabilities can be developed...|$|E
30|$|Rifampicins (RIF) {{comprise}} {{a group of}} antibacterial drugs that include the derivatives: rifampicin, rifapentine, rifabutin and <b>rifalazil</b> [41]. These bind bacterial beta RNA polymerase (rpoB) subunit thus interfering with transcription [41]. Resistance to rifampicins in M.tb is conferred by mutations in the 81 -bp region of the rpoB gene (encoding beta Ribonucleic Acid, RNA polymerase) [54, 55]. Both rifampicin and isoniazid are essential and commonly used as first-line drugs for TB therapy [37]. Following introduction of rifampicin into clinical use, treatment of active TB was reduced from 9 – 12 to 6  months, while the duration for treatment of latent TB was reduced from 9 to 3  months [40]. It {{is important to note}} that rifampicins are among the few drugs that can kill the dormant (non-replicating) strains of M.tb. Rifampicin was developed by blind whole-cell screening in an extensive program of chemical modification of the rifamycins, the natural metabolites of Amycolatopsis mediterranei [56, 57]. Since rpoB is an essential gene in M.tb and RNA polymerase is a proven target for antibacterial and anti-TB therapy, it would be interesting to search for new RNA polymerase inhibitors binding at sites different from that utilized by rifampicin [58].|$|E
