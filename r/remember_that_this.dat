2500|$|The {{leadership}} of the new organization included such prominent activists as Lucretia Mott, Lucy Stone and Frederick Douglass. Its drive for universal suffrage, however, was resisted by some abolitionist leaders and their allies in the Republican Party, who wanted women to postpone their campaign for suffrage until after it had been achieved for male African Americans. [...] Horace Greeley, a prominent newspaper editor, told Anthony and Stanton, [...] "This is a critical period for the Republican Party {{and the life of}} our Nation... I conjure you to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is 'the negro's hour,' and your first duty now is to go through the State and plead his claims." [...] Anthony and Stanton refused to postpone their demands and continued to push for universal suffrage.|$|E

2500|$|There's {{no doubt}} Iraq hasn't fully {{complied}} with its disarmament obligations {{as set forth}} by the Security Council in its resolution. But on the other hand, since 1998 Iraq has been fundamentally disarmed: 90-95% of Iraq's {{weapons of mass destruction}} capacity has been verifiably eliminated... We have to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> missing 5-10% doesn't necessarily constitute a threat... It constitutes bits and pieces of a weapons program which in its totality doesn't amount to much, but which is still prohibited... We can't give Iraq a clean bill of health, therefore we can't close the book on their weapons of mass destruction. But simultaneously, we can't reasonably talk about Iraqi non-compliance as representing a de-facto retention of a prohibited capacity worthy of war. (page 28) ...|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Maus of BikePortland.org {{described}} the sculpture as a [...] "functional work of public art {{that will serve}} {{not just as a}} place to store Zoobomb bikes and equipment, but as a visual testimony to what makes Portland, Portland", and called the day of its installation one that [...] "will live forever in Portland's bike-cultural history". Furthermore, he said the work recognizes Zoobomb as a tradition, a [...] "civic and cultural institution with deep connections" [...] to the city. In his coverage of the dedication ceremony, Maus wrote: [...] "It's important to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is not just for Zoobomb. It's for all of us. It's from a City that encourages and recognizes the power of creative expression and activism embodied not just in a physical monument, but in the spirit of every Portlander." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{a result}} of ethical consideration, most {{research}} into diseases and conditions affecting fetal development has been restricted {{to the use of}} other animals aside from human beings. [...] Most accounts on the implications caused by diseases or conditions like rubella, hypothyroidism and intrauterine hypoxia involving humans have come from studies done on patients later in life, or more appropriately, after birth. [...] Although there is much evidence that points towards these prenatal diseases or conditions being precursors for improper brain development, and thus potential consequences for memory, it is hard to assume that these alone are the only cause. [...] If one could test for, and track the onset of the disease during gestation while screening potential extraneous variables, one may be able to better understand this topic. [...] It is important to <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is a newer, less explored, aspect of memory research. [...] If anything can be taken from this, it should be that most of these diseases or conditions resulting in poor fetal brain development can be prevented or mitigated if one exercises healthy living behaviour. [...] A large part of this involves proper nutrition and dieting.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second part}} is finding e, the {{additional}} offset days {{that must be}} added to the date offset d to make it arrive at a Sunday. Since the week has 7 days, the offset must be in the range 0 to 6 and determined by modulo 7 arithmetic. e is determined by calculating [...] These constants may seem strange at first, but are quite easily explainable if we remember that we operate under mod 7 arithmetic. To begin with, [...] ensures that we take care of the fact that weekdays slide for each year. A normal year has 365 days, but , so 52 full weeks make up one day too little. Hence, each consecutive year, the weekday [...] "slides one day forward", meaning if May 6 was a Wednesday one year, it is a Thursday the following year (disregarding leap years). Both b and c increases by one for an advancement of one year (disregarding modulo effects). The expression [...] thus increases by 6—but <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is the same as subtracting 1 mod 7. And to subtract by 1 is exactly what is required for a normal year – since the weekday slips one day forward we should compensate one day less to arrive at the correct weekday (i.e. Sunday). For a leap year, b becomes 0 and 2b thus is 0 instead of 8—which under mod 7, is another subtraction by 1—i.e., a total subtraction by 2, as the weekdays after the leap day that year slides forward by two days.|$|E
