40|$|The {{marketing}} of wheat in the U. S. involves complex interregional grain movements. Moving the crop from {{the areas of}} concentrated production to points where it is used or exported requires a large transportation capacity. To {{provide a basis for}} policy and investment decisions, detailed information on wheat movements during 1977 was collected from 3, 500 grain merchandising, processing, and exporting firms in 41 states. Survey data on <b>receipts</b> <b>and</b> <b>shipments</b> for each state or substate area were expanded to represent total volumes for those areas and were verified by comparison with information from secondary sources. The data, which represent the most comprehensive and accurate information available on wheat movements, are presented and summarized in this bulletin...|$|E
40|$|This {{report has}} been {{prepared}} to summarize {{the findings of the}} Y- 12 National Security Complex (Y- 12 Complex) Mass Balance Project and to support preparation of associated U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) site reports. The project was conducted in support of DOE efforts to assess the potential for health and environmental issues resulting from the presence of transuranic (TRU) elements and fission products in recycled uranium (RU) processed by DOE and its predecessor agencies. The United States government used uranium in fission reactors to produce plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons production. Because uranium was considered scarce relative to demand when these operations began almost 50 years ago, the spent fuel from U. S. fission reactors was processed to recover uranium for recycling. The estimated mass balance for highly enriched RU, which is of most concern for worker exposure and is the primary focus of this project, is summarized in a table. A discrepancy in the mass balance between <b>receipts</b> <b>and</b> <b>shipments</b> (plus inventory and waste) reflects an inability to precisely distinguish between RU and non-RU shipments and receipts involving the Y- 12 Complex and Savannah River. Shipments of fresh fuel (non-RU) and sweetener (also non-RU) were made from the Y- 12 Complex to Savannah River along with RU shipments. The only way to distinguish between these RU and non-RU streams using available records is by enrichment level. Shipments of {le} 90 % enrichment were assumed to be RU. Shipments of > 90 % enrichment were assumed to be non-RU fresh fuel or sweetener. This methodology using enrichment level to distinguish between RU and non-RU results in good estimates of RU flows that are reasonably consistent with Savannah River estimates. Although this is the best available means of distinguishing RU streams, this method does leave a difference of approximately 17. 3 MTU between <b>receipts</b> <b>and</b> <b>shipments.</b> Slightly depleted RU streams received by the Y- 12 Complex from ORGDP and PGDP are believed to have been returned to the shipping site or disposed of as waste on the Oak Ridge Reservation. No evidence of Y- 12 Complex processing of this material was identified in the historical records reviewed by the Project Team...|$|E

40|$|Current {{safeguards}} approaches {{used by the}} IAEA at {{gas centrifuge}} enrichment plants (GCEPs) need enhancement in order to detect undeclared LEU production with adequate detection probability. ''Mailbox'' declarations {{have been used in}} the last two decades to verify receipts, production, and shipments at some bulk-handling facilities (e. g., fuel-fabrication plants). The operator declares the status of his plant to the IAEA on a daily basis using a secure ''Mailbox'' system such as a secure tamper-resistant computer. The operator agrees to hold <b>receipts</b> <b>and</b> <b>shipments</b> for a specified period of time, along with a specified number of annual inspections, to enable inspector access to a statistically large enough population of UF{sub 6 } cylinders and fuel assemblies to achieve the desired detection probability. The inspectors can access the ''Mailbox'' during randomly timed inspections and then verify the operator's declarations for that day. Previously, this type of inspection regime was considered mainly for verifying the material balance at fuel-fabrication, enrichment, and conversion plants. Brookhaven National Laboratory has expanded the ''Mailbox'' concept with short-notice random inspections (SNRIs), coupled with enhanced video surveillance, to include declaration and verification of UF{sub 6 } cylinder operational data to detect activities associated with undeclared LEU production at GCEPs. Since the ''Mailbox'' declarations would also include data relevant to material-balance verification, these randomized inspections would replace the scheduled monthly interim inspections for material-balance purposes; in addition, the inspectors could simultaneously perform the required number of Limited-Frequency Unannounced Access (LFUA) inspections used for HEU detection. This approach would provide improved detection capabilities for a wider range of diversion activities with not much more inspection effort than at present...|$|E
40|$|TRIPLES is a web-accessible {{database}} of TRansposon-Insertion Phenotypes, Localization and Expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae—a relational database housing {{nearly half a}} million data points generated from an ongoing study using large-scale transposon mutagenesis to characterize gene function in yeast. At present, TRIPLES contains three principal data sets (i. e. phenotypic data, protein localization data and expression data) for over 3500 annotated yeast genes as well as several hundred non-annotated open reading frames. In addition, the TRIPLES web site provides online order forms linked to each data set so that users may request any strain or reagent generated from this project free of charge. In response to user requests, the TRIPLES web site has undergone several recent modifications. Our localization data have been supplemented with approximately 500 fluorescent micrographs depicting actual staining patterns observed upon indirect immunofluorescence analysis of indicated epitope-tagged proteins. These localization data, as well as all other data sets within TRIPLES, are now available in full as tab-delimited text. To accommodate increased reagent requests, all orders are now cataloged in a separate database, and users are notified immediately of order <b>receipt</b> <b>and</b> <b>shipment.</b> Also, TRIPLES is one of five sites incorporated into the new functional analysis tool Function Junction provided by the Saccharomyces Genome Database.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} discussion/presentation is {{to clarify}} {{applications}} for an emerging alternative to “dewater ” low-level radioactive waste/mixed waste (LLW/MW), wastewater, and sludge using WaterWorks Crystals®. Most waste handling, processing, and disposal sites have restrictions to control the <b>receipt,</b> handling, <b>and</b> <b>shipment</b> of wet wasteforms. For selected wasteforms, this alternative can significantly reduce lifecycle costs and simultaneously simplify field processes so they are safer and quicker to apply in support of ALARA goals. Recent advances in aqueous superabsorbent polymer technology using WaterWorks Crystals® allow for low-volume, low-weight, cost-effective options to solidify, transport, and bury large volumes of wet wastes and liquids. These methods have been proven {{at a variety of}} facilities. Selected/example technical options, sensitivities, volumes, and life-cycle costs will be compared and contrasted to “conventional ” technologies. For over 20 years traditional waste dewatering and stabilization/solidification (S/S) processes (i. e. evaporation, clay, cement, CKD) have been used. Recent waste reduction initiatives by Federal agencies, and cost-cutting measures by companies often require that these familiar technologies be re-evaluated. They are often over-used for simple dewatering processes and may introduce a variety of subtle issues (i. e. more waste, inhalation hazards, and excess labor) that result in greater long-term liabilities and increased life-cycle waste management costs. The audience may use this information to make site-specific safety, cost, and compliance evaluations regarding use of WaterWorks Crystals®...|$|R
40|$|The {{storage of}} {{granular}} materials {{has had an}} important role in the agribusiness. Storing granular materials in silos, instead of in bags or big-bags, has been an increase tendency. Aiming at an economic and rational solution for storing granular materials this paper presents an alternative design: a multi-cell silo group composed of reinforced masonry rectangular cells coupled two by two in width, and a variable number of cells in length according to the volume of desired storage. Such symmetrical system benefits the loading and the unloading operations, and guarantees the continuity between the <b>receipt</b> flow <b>and</b> the <b>shipment</b> flow. The silo bottom is designed as a double pyramidal central opening hopper. The hoppers are built in precast-concrete trussed panels. Cells and hoppers are supported on reinforced concrete beams and columns. The thermal insulation needed to preserve the quality of the grains is obtained by using galvanized steel trapezoid tiles for the roof as well as for the lateral closure. An example is presented and the feasibility of the alternative design is discussed...|$|R

40|$|This third {{report in}} the series reviews {{possible}} safeguards approaches for new fast reactors in general, and the ABR in particular. Fast-neutron spectrum reactors have been used since the early 1960 s on an experimental and developmental level, generally with fertile blanket fuels to “breed” nuclear fuel such as plutonium. Whether the reactor is designed to breed plutonium, or transmute and “burn” actinides depends mainly {{on the design of}} the reactor neutron reflector and the whether the blanket fuel is “fertile” or suitable for transmutation. However, the safeguards issues are very similar, since they pertain mainly to the <b>receipt,</b> <b>shipment</b> <b>and</b> storage of fresh and spent plutonium and actinide-bearing “TRU”-fuel. For these reasons, the design of existing fast reactors and details concerning how they have been safeguarded were studied in developing advanced safeguards approaches for the new fast reactors. In this regard, the design of the Experimental Breeder Reactor-II “EBR-II” at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) was of interest, because it was designed as a collocated fast reactor with a pyrometallurgical reprocessing and fuel fabrication line – a design option being considered for the ABR. Similarly, the design of the Fast Flux Facility (FFTF) on the Hanford Site was studied, because it was a successful prototype fast reactor that ran for two decades to evaluate fuels and the design for commercial-scale fast reactors...|$|R

40|$|Filarial {{nematodes}} {{cause serious}} and debilitating infections in human populations of tropical countries, contributing to an entrenched cycle of poverty. Only one human filarial parasite, Brugia malayi, {{can be maintained}} in rodents in the laboratory setting. It has been a widely used model organism in experiments that employ culture systems, the impact of which on the worms is unknown. Using Illumina RNA sequencing, we characterized changes in gene expression upon in vitro maintenance of adult B. malayi female worms at four time points: immediately upon removal from the host, immediately after <b>receipt</b> following <b>shipment,</b> <b>and</b> after 48 h and 5 days in liquid culture media. The dramatic environmental change and the 24 h time lapse between removal from the host and establishment in culture caused a globally dysregulated gene expression profile. We found a maximum of 562 differentially expressed genes based on pairwise comparison between time points. After an initial shock upon removal from the host and shipping, a few stress fingerprints remained after 48 h in culture and until the experiment was stopped. This was best illustrated by a strong and persistent up-regulation of several genes encoding cuticle collagens, as well as serpins. These findings suggest that B. malayi can be maintained in culture as a valid system for pharmacological and biological studies, at least for several days after removal from the host and adaptation to the new environment. However, genes encoding several stress indicators remained dysregulated until the experiment was stopped...|$|R
