40|$|We {{measured}} the isotopic composition and accumulation of {{particulate organic matter}} (POM) and the uptake of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in an early bloom of the most productive <b>recurring</b> <b>polynya</b> of the Arctic Ocean. The estimated compensation irradiance {{at the onset of}} the bloom was similar to the average for the North Atlantic Ocean, implying that shallow mixing was of critical importance for the bloom’s early initiation. Planktonic POM had a much lower � 13 C than ice POM, suggesting that ice-algae contributed little to the pelagic biomass. The overall isotopic fractionation of pelagic N during bloom development was consistent with in situ diatom growth under saturating irradiance and limiting NO 3. Soon after the ice cleared, rapid physiological changes induced an order of magnitude increase in the C and NO 3 uptake capacity of diatoms, leading to very high f ratios (NO 3 uptake: total N uptake). Most of the NO 3 taken up appeared in the POM, so that little net release of reduced N occurred during the period of active growth. Given the tight coupling between photosynthesis and NO 3 uptake under N limitation, the magnitude of primary production in the Arctic Ocean is expected to respond to changes in N supply...|$|E
40|$|For the {{formation}} and modification of water masses in the polar oceans the surface processes of freezing and melting are of great importance. At coastal polynyas, a major fraction of the annual ice production of the high-latitude oceans takes place, since they are usually kept open mechanically, primarily by winds, and the ocean surface is at freezing point. The very thin sea ice cover or the total lack thereof allows for locally enhanced exchange processes between ocean and atmosphere, especially {{an increase in the}} heat flux that leads to very high freezing rates and the high brine rejection associated. In polynya areas, very cold and salty water masses are formed and thus the duration and extent of polynya events have a substantial effect on bottom water formation. In the western Weddell Sea, recurring coastal polynyas are formed in front of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf and {{in the area of the}} decayed Larsen A/B Ice Shelf. Simulations of oceanic processes linked to polynya occurrence are performed using the Finite-Element Sea-ice Ocean Model FESOM on a global grid with a high resolution (< 3 km) area along the coasts of the Weddell Sea. FESOM is a fully coupled system of a primitive-equation, hydrostatic ocean model and a dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model. The model was forced with data from NCEP reanalysis, fields from GME, and from high-resolution COSMO simulations. The high-resolution experiments give very distinct polynya signatures. We clearly see reoccurring areas of strongly reduced or zero ice concentration and high negative fresh water flux (i. e. strong salt input) along the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula and in front of the Ronne Ice Shelf, but also off Brunt Ice Shelf and Riiser-Larsen Isen. Comparisons with coarse-scale model runs show rather blurred evidence of polynya events. In simulations with 1. 5 ° horizontal resolution, merely the <b>recurring</b> <b>polynya</b> located at Ronne Basin and the high freezing rates over Berkner Bank are visible as local maxima of negative fresh water flux, and a very weak reduction of ice thickness can be seen along the eastern coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. At a location at the outer edge of Ronne Basin, the differences between simulations with different resolution become obvious when looking at vertical profiles of temperature and salinity. It is an area of recurring polynyas which in the high-resolution case results in high salt input and formation of High Salinity Shelf Water (HSSW) entailing strong convection and an almost homogeneously mixed subsurface water column, whereas the coarse grid can not resolve the polynya and features a stratified ocean with a cold surface layer above Modified Warm Deep Water (MWDW). Also in the high-resolution simulation, plumes of cold water can be seen forming at the southwestern corner of the continental shelf and flowing down the slope. They subsequently mix with the warmer water masses around while drifting north. Signatures of similar cold water plumes have been observed during the ISPOL campaign in summer 2004 / 2005...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Polynyas {{are areas}} of open water {{surrounded}} by ice. In the C a n a e h Arctic, {{the largest and}} best known polynya is the North Water. There are also several similar, but smaller, <b>recurring</b> <b>polynyas</b> and shore lead systems. Polynyas appear tobe of critical importance to arctic marine birds and mammals for feeding, reproduction’itnd migration. Despite their obvious biological importance, most polynya areas. are threatened by extensive disturbance and possible pollution {{as a result of}} propesed offshore petrochemical exploration and year-round shipping with ice-brewg capability. However, we cannot evaluate what the effects of such disruptions mi&t be because to date we have conducted insufficient research to enable us to haye: a quantitative understanding of the critical ecological processes and balances that magl,k unique to polynya areas. It is essential that we rectify the situation because the survival of viable populations or subpopulations of several species of arctic marine birds qnd mammals may depend on polynyas. RftSUMfi.

40|$|Coastal polynyas play a {{prominent}} role in the formation and modification of water masses in the polar oceans. A coastal polynya is usually kept open mechanically, primarily by winds, and the ocean surface is at freezing point. Thus a major fraction of the annual ice production of the high-latitude oceans occurs in polynyas and hence the duration and extent of their appearance has a substantial effect on bottom water formation. In the western Weddell Sea, <b>recurring</b> coastal <b>polynyas</b> are formed in front of the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf and {{in the area of the}} decayed Larsen A/B Ice Shelf. Simulations to study polynya formation and their impact on ice production and bottom water formation in the western Weddell Sea were performed with the Finite Element Sea ice-Ocean Model (FESOM) of Alfred-Wegener-Institute (AWI). FESOM is a fully coupled system of a primitive-equation, hydrostatic ocean model and a dynamic-thermodynamic sea ice model. The simulations were conducted on a global grid with a resolution varying between roughly 300 km in tropical latitudes and < 5 km along the coast of the southwestern Weddell Sea. In vertical direction, the grid uses terrain-following coordinates. The model results give insight into the mechanisms governing the formation of transient and persistent polynyas and their influence on ice production and deep water formation. Water mass formation and ice export rates are quantified and compared to observation-based estimates...|$|R
40|$|Results of helicopter-borne {{electromagnetic}} {{measurements of}} total (ice plus snow) sea-ice thickness performed in May 2004 and 2005 in the Lincoln Sea and adjacent Arctic Ocean up to 86 ° N are presented. Thickness distributions south of 84 ° N {{are dominated by}} multi-year ice with modal thicknesses of 3. 9 m in 2004 and 4. 2 m in 2005 (mean thicknesses 4. 67 and 5. 18 m, respectively). Modal and mean snow thickness on multi-year ice amounted to 0. 18 and 0. 30 m in 2004, and 0. 28 and 0. 35 m in 2005. There are also considerable amounts of 0. 9 - 2. 2 m thick first-year ice (modal thickness), mostly representing ice formed in the <b>recurring,</b> refrozen Lincoln <b>Polynya.</b> Results are in good agreement with ground-based electromagnetic thickness measurements and with ice types demarcated in satellite synthetic aperture radar imagery. Four drifting buoys deployed in 2004 between 86 ° N and 84. 5 ° N show a similar pattern of a mean southward drift of the ice pack of 83 ± 18 km between May 2004 and April 2005, towards the coast of Ellesmere Island and Nares Strait. The resulting area decrease of 26 % between the buoys and the coast {{is larger than the}} observed thickness increase south of 84 ° N. This points to the importance of shear in a narrow band along the coast, and of ice export through Nares Strait in removing ice from the study region...|$|R
40|$|The energy {{exchange}} between {{the ocean and}} {{the atmosphere in the}} Antarctic marginal sea ice zone is influenced by the extent of sea-ice cover. In areas of open water, a direct contact is established and intense {{energy exchange}}s occur, due to the large difference of temperature between the water and the air above it. This implies that the polynyas are areas where the ocean exchanges energy with the atmosphere and as a result they {{have an effect on the}} polar meteorology/climate. The work presented here concerns real polynya events in the region of Terra Nova Bay (TNB), Antarctica, where a <b>recurring</b> coastal <b>polynya</b> occurs nearby the Italian Antarctic Base. The aim is the study of the impact of polynyas on the atmosphere by three-dimensional numerical simulations. The ETA model (Mesinger et al., 2006) is used and ECMWF and NCEP data provided the initial and boundary conditions. The model had already been successfully used in the Antarctic area (Casini and Morelli, 2007) A polynya of realistic size (as observed by satellite image) was included in the initial conditions for the simulations and a study of the air circulation during the events is found in Morelli et al. (2007), Morelli and Casini (2008), Morelli et al. (2009). The Eta Model reproduced the evolution of upper and mod-level conditions in good agreement with AVHRR observations (Morelli, 2008, Morelli and Parmiggiani, 2009). Also, the simulated 10 m wind was well correlated with the observed extension of the polynya. In order to isolate the effect of the presence of the open water area on the structure of the atmospheric boundary layer and on the atmospheric circulation, further simulations were performed without the presence of the polynya, i. e. with its extent covered with sea ice. The numerical simulations show that the polynyas act to increase the speed of the air above them and generate strong heat fluxes that warm the air. The effects are found over and downwind the sea ice free area. Results from the Eta Model runs show that a polynya modifies the atmosphere up to a height of several hundred meters and over a long distance from its location. A structure, as a thermal cyclone, develops over the eastern side of the polynyas. This structure is embedded in the pressure field simulated also without taking into account the polynya...|$|R
40|$|Coastal polynyas {{are areas}} of {{partially}} or totally ice free water which form in coastal regions during the wintertime {{in spite of}} the low air temperatures. Coastal polynyas are often referred to as ‘latent heat polynyas’. They are thought to be opened and maintained by strong offshore winds blowing over the area, and by the curvature of the coastline. Sea ice is removed by the wind and new ice is constantly formed and exported (Smith et al, 1990) with a consequent release of latent heat. Atmospheric numerical modelling and satellite observations are fundamental tools for the analysis of winter polynya events occurring over remote and often data sparse polar regions. This study concerns the region of Terra Nova Bay (TNB) in Antarctica, where a <b>recurring</b> coastal <b>polynya</b> occurs offshore the Italian Antarctic Base ‘Mario Zucchelli Station’ (MZS). The aim is the study of a real event of TNB polynya and the two way interaction between strong katabatic winds, blowing from the coast, and development of the polynya. The atmospheric circulation of the area is studied by simulations performed with ETA model in its last version (Mesinger et al., 2006), also with a piecewise linear advection for the wind field. A previous version of the model was yet successfully used for simulations in the Antarctic area (De Carolis et al, 2006, Casini e Morelli, 2007). Satellite images from AMSR-E (Morelli et al, 2007) and AVHRR and observational data integrate the analysis. The presented case study is a polynya event happened during the period 12 - 17 July 2006. AMSR-E images displayed the presence of a sea ice free area, that reached an extension of 4000 km 2 on 16 July 2006. 72 hours simulations were carried on in order to study the atmospheric circulation of the period over a large area; ECMWF analyses provided the initial and boundary conditions. Furthermore, ETA simulations, nested in the previous domain, were performed with a finer resolution. To gain some insight on atmospheric response to open water within a sea ice field, simulations were carried on both with and without a prescribed open polynya (derived by AMSR-E images) forced in the initial conditions. Simulations were performed with 50 layers in the vertical from sea surface to 25 hPa, with higher resolution {{near the bottom of the}} domain. Horizontal resolution was 0, 125 x 0, 125 transformed degrees (about 15 kmx 15 km) for the coarser grid, and 0, 05 x 0, 05 transformed degrees for the finer grid (about 8 kmx 8 km), respectively. Numerical simulations show that cyclonic structures were moving over the Ross Sea, and that the polynya development, displayed by satellite images, was related to the katabatic wind field blowing from the Reeves glacier. ETA simulations performed with an realistic open water region in the initial conditions show a strengthening of the surface wind field over the ice free area...|$|R
40|$|Coastal polynyas {{are areas}} of open water (and/or very thin ice) which form {{adjacent}} to coasts or blocking feature in polar regions during the wintertime, when the sea water {{is expected to}} be ice covered. They are thought to be maintained by strong offshore winds blowing over these area and/or by ocean currents. Sea ice is removed as it forms and drifted offshore. In polynya areas a direct contact is established between the relatively warm sea water and the cold, dry atmosphere. As a consequence, the physical characteristics of the atmospheric boundary layer change. The work presented here concerns a real polynya event in the region of Terra Nova Bay (TNB), Antarctica, where a <b>recurring</b> coastal <b>polynya</b> occurs nearby the Italian Antarctic Base. The aim is the study of atmospheric response to the presence of a open water area of realistic size by three-dimensional numerical simulations. Atmospheric numerical modelling is a fundamental tool for the study of air - polynya interactions in the remote polar regions, where observational data are difficult. The numerical model used for the simulations is a recent version of ETA model (Mesinger et al., 2006), {{with the addition of a}} piecewise linear advection for the wind field. ECMWF and NCEP data provided the initial and boundary conditions. A previous version of the model had already been successfully used in the Antarctic area (De Carolis et al, 2006, Casini and Morelli, 2007). As a first step to analyze the polynya event, numerical simulation was performed for the period from 12 to 17 July 2006 in order to study the development of the katabatic wind (Morelli and Casini, 2008; Morelli, 2008). Daily satellite images, concerning the period, display that a sea ice free area formed on 15 and 16 July, reaching its maximum extension of about 4000 km 2 on 16 July (Morelli et al., 2007). In order to gain insight on the atmospheric response to open water area within a sea ice field, ETA model runs were carried out from 15 to 17 July 2006 both with and without the polynya (as derived by satellite image) included in the initial conditions. Results from these experiments will be presented. Simulations were performed with 50 layers in the vertical from sea surface to 25 hPa, with higher resolution near the bottom of the domain. Horizontal resolution was 0, 125 x 0, 125 transformed degrees (about 20 kmx 20 km). Numerical simulations show that the polynya had significant effects on temperature, specific humidity, vertical velocity and horizontal wind speed throughout the boundary layer. The effects are found over and downwind the sea ice free area. The presence of polynya produced significant thermal modifications in atmosphere. Turbulent kinetic energy also responded to its presence and the low level wind speed changed over the open water area. References: Casini, G., Morelli, S.
