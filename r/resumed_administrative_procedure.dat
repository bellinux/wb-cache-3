40|$|On January 1 st, 2006, the act no. 500 / 2004 Coll., <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code (hereinafter "New <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code") {{has come}} into effect, {{replacing}} the act no. 71 / 1967 Coll., on <b>administrative</b> proceedings (<b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code) (hereinafter "Old <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code"). The New <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code came with {{a broad range of}} new legal institutes and altered many others. The purpose of this thesis is to place the New <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code and the Old <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> side by side to compare them with one another and to attempt to evaluate the contribution of the New <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code to the Czech legal system. The structure of the thesis follows the structure of the New <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code. Because of the range restrictions, this thesis cannot cover the whole content of both <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> codes, so the scope of the thesis is limited only to the most important or the most interesting changes that the New <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code has brought. The thesis is composed of nine chapters; each of them deals with a different part of <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> codes. The first chapter describes the process of birth of the New <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> code and comments on the explanatory report. Chapter two focuses on [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the quality}} of legal norms in {{existing}} Law on <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure,</b> for the realization of citizens' rights in the Republic of Serbia in accordance to international legal standards, a significant problem are specific <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures.</b> In this type of procedures {{in recent years have}} been made many variations from the basic rules of general <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure,</b> which can not be classified as requirements of the specific nature of proceeding in certain administrative matters. Therefore it is particularly important that it in new Law on <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> (which will begin to fully implement from 1 June 2017) is provided no more only an obligation of compliance of rules in specific <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures</b> with the basic principles of <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure,</b> but now also a prohibition of reducing the level of protection of rights and legal interests of the parties guaranteed by the law on <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure,</b> as well as a legal obligation to harmonize all special procedures with the new law, no later than 1 June 2018. Based on mentioned solutions in the new Law on <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedures,</b> to citizens of the Republic of Serbia should be allowed to fully realize their rights and legal interests in administrative proceedings, in accordance to the most important international legal standards. However, the drawback of the existing legal solution is a lack of effective mechanism that should ensure that numerous deviations in the special <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures</b> actually remove in prescribed period, and that all special laws harmonize with the new Law on <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure...</b>|$|R

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2014, the Republic of Serbia has become a candidate {{for membership in the}} European Union. As such, it {{is in the process of}} harmonizing its legal system with the EU legislation. On the one hand, Serbia will have to make some new regulations which are currently missing. On the other hand, along with the adoption of the new (missing) regulations, Serbia will have to amend or supplement some of the existing regulations, in order to make them comply with the EU law. In this context, we may observe the need to harmonize the Serbian <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> with the EU legislation. The key issue is to which extent the process of harmonizing the Serbian regulations with the EU law extends to the basic <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> regulations governing the work of public administration and public services in deciding on particular cases. Does the General <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act diverge from the EU law and does it have to be harmonized with the EU law? EU member states are not obliged to harmonize their <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> legislations with EU regulations as the applicable principle in this respect is the principle of procedural autonomy of each Member State. Moreover, there are member states that do not have a codified <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure.</b> On the other hand, there are significant differences among the EU member states which have codified their <b>administrative</b> <b>procedures.</b> Some countries have regulated only general procedural issues, while other countries have enacted detailed <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> acts. Serbia has had the General <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act since 1930 (as a member of the former Yugoslavia) and this legislative act falls into the category of high-quality procedural laws. All the principles established by the European Court of Justice are already built into the current Serbian General <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act. Therefore, Serbia has a legislative act which is by no means inferior to those enacted in many EU member states; moreover, the quality of some <b>administrative</b> <b>procedure</b> solutions may be said to be superior to the legal solutions enacted in many EU member states. Therefore, we may conclude that the existing General <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Act of the Republic of Serbia is not an obstacle on the road to the European Union...|$|R

The aim of the thesis is to describe the basic features of the decision under <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Code and the decision under Code of Administrative Justice, their legal definition, conception and relation to the other results of activity of public administration, their division and other characteristics. Such analysis is supposed to serve for comparison of both institutes in order to draw a conclusion about their mutual conformity, resemblance and difference and because of that also their correlation.

Chapter one defines administrative act, as concept that is universal, blanket and determinative for decision of an administrative body under <b>Administrative</b> <b>Procedure</b> Code and also under the Code of Administrative Justice and therefore using specification of administrative act is possible to specify also common components of concept decision.
