5|$|Eli Lilly {{experienced}} dramatic growth during Daniels' {{tenure at}} the company. Prozac sales made up 30–40% of Lilly's income during the mid-to-late 1990s, and Lilly doubled its assets to $12.8 billion and doubled its <b>revenue</b> <b>to</b> $10 billion during the same period. When Daniels later became Governor of Indiana, he drew heavily on his former Lilly colleagues to serve as advisers and agency managers.|$|E
5|$|Ethiopian Airlines started “Vision 2010” in 2005, which {{aimed to}} {{increase}} passenger traffic to 3million, <b>revenue</b> <b>to</b> billion and employees to 6,000 by 2010. By the year 2010 Ethiopian had exceeded all goals set in “Vision 2010”, and the company's net {{profit for the}} fiscal year ended 2010-6-30 was million. The results were attributed in part to an aggressive marketing campaign and major cost cutting measures.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{negotiations}} between Sultan Ali and the Temenggong ensued with the British colonial government {{acting as the}} intermediary, after Sultan Ali had questioned the Temenggong's rights of keeping the state <b>revenue</b> <b>to</b> himself. Initially, the Temenggong proposed to split the trade revenue of Johor on condition that Sultan Ali surrendered his claims of sovereignty over Johor. The term was declined by Sultan Ali. Both parties agreed to seek the direct intervention of the British government, among which, the British Governor of the Straits Settlement, Colonel William Butterworth, and his successor, Edmund Blundell were roped in to act as meditators.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{source of}} funds {{was to be the}} tax on exports of cotton. However, in {{addition}} to the difficulties associated with the blockade, the self-imposed embargo on cotton meant that for all practical purposes the tax was completely ineffective as a fund raiser. Initial optimistic estimates of <b>revenue</b> <b>to</b> be collected through this tax ran as high as 20 million dollars, but in the end only $30 thousand was collected.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{appointed}} {{a group of}} insurance experts to study the state's policies and put them out for bid, ultimately saving $2 million.

He opened communications and contacts with Japan, {{setting the stage for}} future economic relations between that country and Kentucky. Among his other accomplishments as governor were the implementation of competitive bidding for government contracts and passage of a weight-distance tax on trucks.|$|E

5|$|By 2003 Wikipedia {{had grown}} to 100,000 {{articles}} in its English-language version, and it became difficult for Bomis to continue financially supporting the project. With Wikipedia a drain on the company's resources, Wales and Sanger decided to fund the project on a non-profit basis. Bomis laid off most of its employees to continue operating, since Wikipedia was not generating revenue. The company owned Wikipedia from its creation through 2003, and Wales used about $100,000 of Bomis' <b>revenue</b> <b>to</b> fund Wikipedia before the decision to shift the encyclopedia to non-profit status.|$|E
5|$|Despite closer {{co-operation}} {{and improvements}} {{made to the}} Bakerloo stations and {{to other parts of}} the network, the Underground railways continued to struggle financially. The UERL's ownership of the highly profitable London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) since 1912 had enabled the UERL group, through the pooling of <b>revenue,</b> <b>to</b> use profits from the bus company to subsidise the less profitable railways. However, competition from numerous small bus companies during the early 1920s eroded the profitability of the LGOC and had a negative impact on the profitability of the whole UERL group.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} Western Han, a wealthy salt or iron industrialist, whether a {{semi-autonomous}} king or wealthy merchant, could boast funds that rivaled the imperial treasury and amass a peasant workforce of over a thousand. This kept many peasants {{away from their}} farms and denied the government {{a significant portion of}} its land tax <b>revenue.</b> <b>To</b> eliminate the influence of such private entrepreneurs, Emperor Wu nationalized the salt and iron industries in 117 BC and allowed many of the former industrialists to become officials administering the monopolies. By Eastern Han times, the central government monopolies were repealed in favor of production by commandery and county administrations, as well as private businessmen.|$|E

With this funding seemingly guaranteed, the counties kept other taxes much lower than other counties in the state, increasing their dependence on the timber payments.

5|$|The high {{concentration}} and more sedentary nature of shepherding in the UK allowed sheep especially adapted to their particular purpose and region to be raised, thereby {{giving rise to}} an exceptional variety of breeds {{in relation to the}} land mass of the country.
