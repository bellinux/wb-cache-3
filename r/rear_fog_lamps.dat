25|$|Proponents of twin <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> say {{two lamps}} provide vehicle {{distance}} information not available {{from a single}} lamp. Proponents of the single rear fog lamp say dual <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> closely mimic the appearance of illuminated stop lamps (which are mandatorily installed in pairs), reducing the conspicuity of the stop lamps' message when the rear fogs are activated. To provide some safeguard against <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> being confused with stop lamps, UN Regulation 48 requires a separation of at least 10cm between the closest illuminated edges of any stop lamp and any rear fog lamp.|$|E
25|$|Most jurisdictions permit <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> to be {{installed}} either singly or in pairs. If a single rear fog is fitted, most jurisdictions require it to be located at or to the driver's side of the vehicle's centreline—whichever side is the prevailing driver's side {{in the country in}} which the vehicle is registered. This is to maximize the sight line of following drivers to the rear fog lamp. In many cases, a single reversing lamp is mounted on the passenger side of the vehicle, positionally symmetrical with the rear fog. If two <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> are fitted, they must be symmetrical with respect to the vehicle's centreline.|$|E
25|$|Typically, bulbs of 21 to 27watts, {{producing}} 280 to 570 lumens (22 to 45 mean spherical candlepower) {{are used}} for stop, turn, reversing and <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> while bulbs of 4 to 10W, producing 40 to 130lm (3 to 10 mscp) {{are used for}} tail lamps, parking lamps, side marker lamps and side turn signal repeaters.|$|E

5000|$|NSW Rural Fire Service on {{the other}} hand, do *not* specify this ADR {{optional}} lamp system, noting Australian Road Rule 221(e), allows drivers to use their flashing hazard-warning lights under [...] "hazardous weather conditions causing reduced visibility" [...] instead. (A rule that runs contrary to Article 32 of the 1968 [...] "UN Convention on Road Traffic" [...] and one that therefore that will be rescinded). The <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> is seen at twice the distance of regular tail-lamps.|$|R
25|$|The only {{significant}} export {{market for the}} Falcon outside of Oceania has been South Africa, but was dropped in the early 2000s. (In the early 1970s, the Falcon XY had been assembled in South Africa as the Fairmont, before being fully imported.) Some limousines and hearses (inc. LPG-only powered Utes) were exported to the UK by Coleman Milne, who used to convert European-made Granadas and Scorpios for the same purposes. Earlier, some XA and XB Fairmonts were shipped to the UK as was the contemporary LTD which was modified with Ford Europe tail lights to add the mandatory <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> and also had to have new screenwash nozzles as the protruding original items did not meet EU safety rules.|$|E
2500|$|Several concept models {{preceded the}} launch of the third-generation IS. The first was the LF-LC (2012). It is a rear-wheel drive concept coupe with mesh pattern of the spindle grille in 3D {{sculpture}} form, daytime running lights shaped like an [...] "L", vertical front fog lamps in fading dot matrix pattern, glass roof with cantilevered pillar with a glass-to-glass juncture inspired by modern architecture, <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps,</b> twin 12.3-inch LCD screens provide information and navigation display, leather and suede interior upholstery with brushed metal trim and wood accents, race-inspired front seats are formed of multiple layers and repeat the interlacing curves that define the cabin interior, racing-style steering wheel upholstered in carbon fibre with integrated controls and start button. The vehicle was unveiled in 2012 North American International Auto Show.|$|E
2500|$|In Europe {{and other}} {{countries}} adhering to UN Regulation 48, vehicles must be equipped {{with one or two}} bright red [...] "rear fog lamps", which serve as high-intensity rear position lamps to be turned on by the driver in conditions of poor visibility to make the vehicle more visible from the rear. The allowable range of intensity for a rear fog lamp is 150 to 300 candela, which is within the range of a U.S. stop lamp (brake light). <b>Rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamps</b> are not required equipment in the U.S., but they are permitted, and are found almost exclusively on European-brand vehicles in North America. Audi, Jaguar, Mercedes, MINI, Land Rover, Porsche, Saab and Volvo provide functional rear fog lights on their North American models. Some vehicles from non-European brands which are adaptions of European-market offerings, such as the first generation Ford Transit Connect, come standard with rear fog lights, or vehicles with European market counterparts, such as the second generation Chrysler 300, have an option for them. The final generation Oldsmobile Aurora also had dual rear fog lights installed in the rear bumper as standard equipment.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, Federal {{lighting}} regulations required headlamps of {{sealed beam}} construction and standard {{size and shape}} on all vehicles, so Accords in North America were equipped with four rectangular headlamp units rather than the aerodynamic composite replaceable-bulb units used on Accords sold outside North America (note European specification imagery). Other Automotive lighting variations included amber front and red rear side marker lights and reflectors in North America, and headlamp washers and a red <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> for European markets. Japanese-market Accords were unique from all other markets in that they included adjustable ride height control and side view mirrors installed on the mid-forward fenders.|$|R
5000|$|The European model Corolla four-door sedan, three- and five-door hatchbacks, and {{the regular}} wagon {{basically}} has {{the front end}} of the Japan-spec Corolla FX, except for the all white clearance lights and the [...] "TOYOTA" [...] or the ellipse emblem instead of the [...] "FX" [...] or [...] "GT" [...] of the Japanese models. It has the standard side marker lights and the tail light with the integrated <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> (except for the wagon, which has the <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> on the tailgate.) European market Corollas also have headlight washers on the XL and the XLi models. The five-door liftback used the Japanese market Sprinter Cielo body in its entirety, although in Europe it was available with the little 1.3 liter engine as well. The second generation Sprinter Carib was also sold as a Corolla in Europe, where it replaced the Tercel Wagon. This little four-wheel drive station wagon received the [...] "Touring" [...] suffix in most European markets. The hatchback, representing the most popular and most closely contested market segment in Europe, suffered from being somewhat of a design afterthought. As opposed to its European competitors, where hatchbacks received a tacked-on trunk to become sedans (à la Ford's Orion, the Volkswagen Jetta, or the Opel Kadett sedan), the Japanese hatchback was derived from the sedan. As a result, the design was a bit truncated and trunk space was minimal at 281 L. This was only a fraction more than the much smaller Citroën AX, and considerably less than for competitors such as the Kadett and Fiat Tipo (390 and 345 L).|$|R
50|$|Other safety {{features}} include an Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) to avoid skidding {{in the event}} of sudden emergency braking and Electronic Brakeforce Distribution (EBD) to ensure that the correct amount of braking power is sent to the correct wheels according to the current weight distribution of the car. Two front airbags and pre-tensioner seat belts are installed for the front passengers. However, Exora models sold in Australia come with four airbags and Electronic Stability Control (ESC) in addition to the above. In the end of January 2015, the facelifted Exora Bold known as Exora Bold MC2 in Malaysia finally getting standard ESC, 4 airbags, reverse camera, <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp,</b> plus DRL for the top variant just like the Australian version.|$|R

50|$|On the outside, the SE30 {{differed}} from other Diablo models with a revised front fascia featuring straked brake cooling ducts and a deeper spoiler, while the rear cooling ducts were {{changed to a}} vertical body-colored design. The raging bull emblem was moved {{from the front of}} the luggage lid to the nose panel of the car between the front indicators. The engine lid had slats covering the narrow rear window, while a larger spoiler was installed as standard equipment. The single <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> and <b>rear</b> backup lamp, which had been on either side of the rear grille, were moved into the bumper; this change would be applied to all Diablo models across the lineup. Completing the exterior variations were special magnesium alloy wheels, SE30 badging, and a new metallic purple paint color (this could be changed upon request).|$|R

50|$|The Suprima is {{the second}} Malaysian-made car to be factory-fitted with LED {{position}} lamps {{and the first to}} be offered with LED Daytime running lights (DRL). The LEDs built into the projector headlights on the Suprima Executive trim are identical to those of the Prevé, whereas those on the Suprima Premium variant are true LED DRLs. The LED DRLs may improve the visual appeal of the Suprima, but more importantly help in improving road safety by increasing the conspicuity of the car during daylight conditions. The inclusion of daytime running lights on passenger cars are not compulsory in Malaysia, but they are mandatory equipment for all passenger cars marketed in European Union member states as of 7 February 2011 under the EU Directive 2008/89/EC. The Suprima also features a <b>rear</b> <b>fog</b> <b>lamp</b> which is mounted centrally on the rear diffuser, bringing the car up to ECE R38 compliance.
