40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we derive the {{information}} theoretic {{capacity of the}} uplink of a cellular system with variable inter site distance and a generalised fading environment. The capacity is {{shown to be a}} direct function of the ratio of total received signal power (from within and outside of a cell) to the AWGN noise power, at any BS. This ratio is defined as the <b>Rise</b> <b>over</b> <b>Thermal</b> (RoT). It is shown that the variation in system parameters like the path loss exponent, number of users, transmit power constraint and the inter site distance, changes the region of operation on a capacity-versus-RoT curve. Results are interpreted for practical channel models and it is shown that RoT provides a useful framework to compare various practical systems. I...|$|E
50|$|In {{tropical}} {{areas of}} Brazil, urbanization is causing a phenomenon called urban heat islands (UHI). These are urban {{areas that have}} <b>risen</b> <b>over</b> the <b>thermal</b> comfort limits due to a large influx of people and only drop within the comfortable range during the rainy season. Urban heat islands can occur over any urban city or built-up area with the correct conditions. Urban heat islands are caused by urban areas with few trees and vegetation to block solar radiation or carry out evapotranspiration, many structures with {{a large proportion of}} roofs, and sidewalks with low reflectivity that absorb heat, high amounts of ground-level carbon dioxide pollution that retains heat released by surfaces, great amounts of heat generated by air-conditioning systems of densely packed buildings, and a large amount of automobile traffic generating heat from engines and exhaust.|$|R
40|$|Tapejara wellnhoferi, a small azhdarchoid pterodactyloid {{from the}} Early Cretaceous Santana Formation of Brazil, {{provides}} critical {{information about the}} aerodynamic function of its spectacular head crest. The cranial crests in pterodactyloids were sexually dimorphic and {{are thought to have}} evolved in adult males in response to female mate choice. However, the location of cranial crests in front of the center of gravity would create instability in the yaw axis during flight and may seem like a handicap. Vertically aligned webbed feet probably suppressed the yawing rotations and instability from the crest. Here we show that the crest functioned as a front rudder to make agile turn and mediate flight control. A computer simulation model suggests that Tapejara had a large excess of muscle power available above the power required for continuous flapping flight. It could easily takeoff from a perch, ground, or water surface and land safely on the ground. It was an excellent glider with a gliding angle close to 40 and a cruising speed of 27 km/h. Tapejara could soar efficiently on the windward side of cliffs or circle on <b>rising</b> <b>thermals</b> <b>over</b> tropical waters for efficient long-distance flight. Various control surfaces in the wings of Tapejara analogous to the slat, aileron, elevator, fin, rudder, and horizontal stabilizer of an aircraft made pterodactyloids versatile flyers.

3000|$|As {{the title}} suggests, the fourth paper [...] "Resource {{allocation}} with EGOS constraint in multicell OFDMA communication systems: combating intercell interference," [...] by H. Li, studies resource allocation in a multicell orthogonal frequency {{division multiple access}} (OFDMA) system using the fairness constraint of equal grade of service (EGOS). The paper considers the situation {{where there is no}} explicit cooperation across different cells and each user's resource (power and bandwidth) is stationarily allocated with the awareness of intercell interference. The paper derives a resource allocation scheme for finite systems using a heuristic <b>rise</b> <b>over</b> <b>thermal</b> (ROT) constraint. In addition, the author employs the large system analysis and variational analysis to obtain the optimal power and bandwidth profiles for the case where there exist sufficiently many users in each cell.|$|E
30|$|The {{heuristic}} {{approach is}} to confine the total received power at AP (<b>Rise</b> <b>Over</b> <b>Thermal,</b> ROT) (the standard definition for ROT should be {{the ratio of the}} total received power over the thermal noise power. For simplicity, we define ROT as the total received power since the noise power is fixed and is known), which is based on the intuition that ROT is roughly proportional to the transmit powers of ATs within the desired cell and also positively correlated with the interference to other cells. Note that the metric of ROT is used to measure the congestion level of the cell in code-division multiple access (CDMA) systems [16]. Meanwhile, there is also requirement for ROT from the hardware viewpoint; if the ROT is too high, that is, the total received power is too high, weak signals may be lost due to the limited number of levels of analog-digital converter (ADC).|$|E

40|$|With high date rates using Enhanced Uplink (EUL), a {{conventional}} signal to interference ratio (SIR) based power control algorithm {{may lead to}} a power rush due to self interference or incompatible SIR target [2]. Time division (TD) scheduling in Wideband Code Division Multiplex Access (WCDMA) {{is considered to be a}} key feature in achieving high user data rates. Unfortunately, power oscillation/peak is observed in time division multiplexing (TDM) at the transition between active and inactive transmission time intervals [1]. Therefore there is a need to revisit power control algorithms for different time division scheduling scenarios. The objective of power control in the context of this study is to minimize the required <b>rise</b> <b>over</b> <b>thermal</b> noise (RoT) for a given data rate, subject to the constraint that the physical layer control channel quality is sufficient (assuming that the dedicated physical control channel (DPCCH) SIR should not go below 3 dB with a probability of at most 5 %). Another goal is to minimize the local oscillation in power (power peaks) that may occur, for example due to transitions between active and inactive transmission tim...|$|E
30|$|Dynamic cell sizing {{is able to}} {{increase}} {{the capacity of the}} forward link by shedding the traffic of overloaded cells to neighboring cells. Consider the case where Cell A in Figure[*] 1 b is heavily congested and Cell B is not. In order to move the handoff boundary by an equal amount that the interference has risen in a cell, the dynamic cell sizing algorithm will introduce an attenuation equal on the forward link of Cell A in response to a <b>rise</b> <b>over</b> <b>thermal</b> noise in the reverse link of Cell A [17]. When the handoff boundary is moved closer to Cell B, the first users that are inside Cell B and are in soft handoff with Cell A may fall out of soft handoff with Cell A, relieving some capacity from Cell A to be used for users that are inside Cell A. The second advantage of dynamic cell sizing is that the traffic channel forward gains will increase by the same amount as the cell sizing attenuation, until the total traffic channel power leaving the cell becomes close to the initial value prior to cell size reduction. The output power after cell sizing will be less due to lower power on overhead channels, assuming overhead channels are not power controlled. The reduction of total transmit power due to reduced power on the overhead channels will eventually be used by new users and therefore the total transmit power will remain unchanged before and after cell sizing under heavy traffic conditions [17].|$|E
