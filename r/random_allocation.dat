2500|$|Permuted-block {{randomization}} or blocked randomization: a [...] "block size" [...] and [...] "allocation ratio" [...] (number {{of subjects}} in one group versus the other group) are specified, and subjects are allocated randomly within each block. For example, a block size of 6 and an allocation ratio of 2:1 {{would lead to}} random assignment of 4 subjects to one group and 2 to the other. This type of randomization can be combined with [...] "stratified randomization", for example by center in a multicenter trial, to [...] "ensure good balance of participant characteristics in each group." [...] A special case of permuted-block randomization is <b>random</b> <b>allocation,</b> in which the entire sample is treated as one block.

30|$|Despite the {{significant}} contributions of this study, {{it is not}} without limitations. One restriction {{is the fact that}} this meta-analysis displays correlations and not necessarily causal effects. To identify causal effects, field experiments with treatment and control groups and <b>random</b> <b>allocations</b> of employees to one of these groups would be helpful. Performing quasi-experiments that include design features like removed treatment may enhance the internal validity (Shadish et al. 2002), because randomized experiments are often impractical or unethical in our context. Statistical techniques like propensity score matching may also facilitate the identification of causal effects (e.g. Guo and Fraser 2014).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Randomization is {{a common}} feature of {{everyday}} resource allocation. We generalize the theory of randomized assignment to accommodate various real-world constraints such as group-specific quotas (“controlled choice”) in school choice and house allocation, and scheduling and curriculum constraints in course allocation. We develop new mechanisms that are ex ante efficient and fair in these environments. We also develop a “utility guarantee ” technique that limits ex-post unfairness in <b>random</b> <b>allocations,</b> supplementing the ex ante fairness promoted by randomization. This {{can be applied to}} multi-unit assignment problems, as well as certain two-sided matching problems such as designing a fair interleague sports schedule...|$|R

40|$|In {{naturally}} deaf {{wireless sensor networks}} or generally {{when there}} is no feedback channel, the fixed-level transmit power of all nodes is the conventional and practical power <b>allocation</b> method. Using <b>random</b> power <b>allocation</b> for the broadcasting nodes has been recently proposed to overcome the limitations and problems of the fixed power allocation. However, the previous work discussed only the performance analysis when uniform power allocation is used for quasi-static channels. This paper gives a general framework to evaluate the performance (in terms of outage and average transmit power) of any truncated probability density function of the random allocated power. Furthermore, dynamic Rayleigh fading channel is considered during the performance analysis which gives more realistic results that the AWGN channels assumed in the previous work. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the communication performance when general <b>random</b> power <b>allocation</b> is used. Furthermore, the truncated inverse exponential probability distribution of the <b>random</b> power <b>allocation</b> is proposed and compared with the fixed and the uniform power allocations.

The most well-established preference relation to compare <b>random</b> <b>allocations</b> of objects is stochastic dominance (SD) which also leads to corresponding notions of envy-freeness, efficiency, and weak strategyproofness. We show that there exists no rule that is anonymous, neutral, efficient and weak strategyproof. For single-unit random assignment, we show that there exists no rule that is anonymous, neutral, efficient and weak group-strategyproof. We then study a generalization of the PS (probabilistic serial) rule called multi-unit-eating PS and prove that multi-unit-eating PS satisfies envy-freeness, weak strategyproofness, and unanimity.
