50|$|The {{first case}} of AIDS in Lesotho was {{discovered}} in 1986. Early efforts to address the spread of HIV were thwarted by poor organization {{and a lack of}} resources. By the early 2000s, the AIDS epidemic in Lesotho had grown to alarming proportions and the death rate had skyrocketed. The public was inadequately informed about how the disease spread and how transmission could be prevented. As the infection and death rate grew, stigmatization and discrimination of the ill grew too. Though government programs were being designed to address this health crisis, mobilization of the resources to implement the programs was lagging. Non-government organizations (NGOs) and foreign government programs were bringing aid, but almost 90% of Lesotho’s population was scattered in remote rural areas that were difficult to reach and often out of <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> programs. New strategies were needed to reach the affected people.|$|E
30|$|Importantly, {{the current}} study gathers views from a broad <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> workers, {{including}} development and national workers who are commonly under-researched. An enhanced understanding of a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> workers’ stressors and effective coping strategies is important for informing responses to stress at the levels of individuals, organisations and the broader aid sector. For individual aid workers, findings from the present research {{can be used to}} normalise stress and disseminate information on the range of commonly used coping styles. Organisations can use aid worker views to improve structures and staff support. At the sector level, results can inform staff-care resources and interventions to reduce staff stress. Given the importance of aid workers to the sector, efforts to reduce staff stress can have flow-on benefits for the delivery of aid.|$|E

30|$|Within {{the wider}} aid sector, there are {{existing}} staff care materials (e.g. McKay 2007) but no empirically tested psychological interventions {{tailored to the}} needs of aid workers. Future development of such interventions could incorporate the current results by focusing on psychological flexibility skills that are effectively taught through approaches such as ACT (Hayes et al. 2006). Ideally, this type of training will be delivered across the sector (possibly by staff care organisations) to reach a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> workers and help mitigate problems of inconsistent organisational support. Sector-wide support for aid workers is important given that there is currently little support for aid workers who face a large variety of stressors.|$|E

In particular, this paper addresses the question whether professionalisation processes that can currently be observed {{in the field of}} humanitarian aid might contribute to minimizing or perpetuating the gap between national and international aid personnel. Professionalisation processes can have very positive effects not only for aid recipients who obtain better services and aid personnel’s careers, but also for donors and hiring aid organizations which benefit from a skilled work force. However, it needs to be critically reflected what kind of knowledge is validated, where it can be obtained and whether credentials guarantee hiring and promotion of qualified staff from all regions...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} current state of {{thinking}} among a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> actors (multilaterals, bilateral, applied scholars and international non-governmental organisations) on how to promote empowerment and accountability in fragile, conflict and violence affected settings. It seeks to identify trends, gaps and weaknesses in that thinking, and propose research questions and hypotheses to test. Three underlying sources of confusion are identified that are hindering progress on both understanding empowerment and accountability in fragile, conflict and violence affected settings, and taking helpful action to promote it. They are: (1) theory of endogenous change (e. g. on how empowerment and accountability arise in situ) versus the theory of action of an external intervention; (2) fragility versus conflict: there is no clear justification for combining these different aspects into a single category; and (3) empowerment versus accountability: donor analysis and practice has been overwhelmingly weighted towards accountability, exhibiting limited understanding or interest in the nature of power.

40|$|There {{has been}} a clear shift in the policy of many donors in the health sector- away from {{discrete}} project assistance towards more broad-based sectoral support. This paper, {{based on interviews with}} officials in a number of bilateral and multilateral agencies, explores whether this shift in policy has been matched by similar changes in the form or <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> instruments. The paper develops a framework for examining current practice in relation to the different objectives that donors seek to promote through technical and financial assistance. In particular, it looks in some detail at the advan-tages and disadvantages of budgetary support compared to more traditional forms of project assistance. It concludes that the debate should not be about whether one form of aid is better than another. Ideally, they should be complementary and the forms, channels and systems used for managing aid need to be assessed in relation to how they help to achieve the mix of development objectives that are most appropriate to the country concerned. The review demonstrates that this is a complex task and that to achieve an effective balance is not easy. The final section summarizes the main themes emerging from the discussion and suggests some preliminary conclusions and proposals for future action. ...|$|E
40|$|Activation-induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) is an {{essential}} regulator of B cell diversification, but its full range of action has until recently been an enigma. Based on homology, it was originally proposed to be an RNA-editing enzyme, but so far, no RNA substrates are known. Rather, it functions by deaminating cytidine, and in this manner, coupled with base-excision repair or mismatch repair machinery, it is a natural mutator. This allows it to {{play a central role}} in adaptive immunity, whereby it initiates the processes of class switch recombination and somatic hypermutation to help generate a diverse and high-affinity repertoire of immunoglobulin isotypes. More recently, it has been appreciated that methylated cytidine, already known as a key epigenetic mark on DNA controlling gene expression, can also be a target for AID modification. Coupled with repair machinery, this can facilitate the active removal of methylated DNA. This activity can impact the process of cellular reprogramming, including transition of a somatic cell to pluripotency, which requires major reshuffling of epigenetic memory. Thus, seemingly disparate roles for AID in controlling immune diversity and epigenetic memory have a common mechanistic basis. However, the very activity that is so useful for B cell diversity and cellular reprogramming is dangerous for the integrity of the genome. Thus, AID expression and activity is tightly regulated, and deregulation is associated with diseases including cancer. Here, we review the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>AID</b> functions with a focus on its mechanisms of action and regulation. Major questions remain to be answered concerning how and when AID is targeted to specific loci and how this impacts development and disease...|$|E

30|$|Aid workers {{experience}} {{elevated levels}} of stress which has a detrimental impact on individuals, organisations and the aid sector; however, there is limited qualitative research capturing aid worker’s views on stressors and coping strategies. This study used thematic analysis to examine aid workers’ views on three research questions: their most common stressors, effective coping strategies and ineffective coping strategies. The study involved a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> workers (N[*]=[*] 218) living in 63 countries, including previously under-researched groups such as development professionals and national workers. Four overarching themes emerged across the three research questions: Work, Psychological, Lifestyle and Social Connection. The most common stressors were work-based issues such as workload, managers and colleagues. Key effective coping strategies were social connections and lifestyle activities such as exercise and hobbies. Ineffective strategies were lifestyle activities such as alcohol and unhealthy eating, and work-based strategies such as working harder. Investigation of aid workers’ views through a qualitative approach rather than quantitative scales yielded important new insights such as the high prevalence of work and team stressors, infrequent mention of trauma as a stressor, {{the important role of}} psychological support, the importance of meaningful work and the observation that coping mechanisms can be both effective and ineffective depending on context. We used additional quantitative analysis to identify many differences between national and international workers but few between humanitarian and development professionals. Regarding theoretical implications, coping strategies were effectively mapped on to the psychological flexibility framework, which underpins acceptance and commitment therapy. We also use the findings to inform practical stress reduction recommendations at the individual, organisational and sector levels. By giving a voice to aid workers, this research extends our understanding of stress and coping within the aid sector, with the potential to enhance aid worker wellbeing and the delivery of aid.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the empirical performance of option pricing {{models in the}} continuous- time affine jump-diffusion (AID) class. In models of this class, the underlying returns are governed by stochastic volatility diffusions and/or jumps and {{the dynamics of the}} whole system has affine dependence on the state variables. The thesis consists of three essays. The first essay calibrates a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>AID</b> option pricing models to S&P 500 index options. The aim is to empirically identify how best to structure two types of risk components- stochastic volatility and jumps - within the framework of multi-factor AID specifications. Our specification analysis shows that the specifications with more-than-two diffusions perform well and that a three-factor specification should be preferred, in which jump intensities are allowed to depend on an independent diffusion process. Having identified the well-performing pricing model specifications, the second essay examines how such a model can be used to forecast realized volatility using only option prices as an input. To do so, the dynamics of volatility implied by the model are used to construct a forecasting equation in which the spot volatilities extracted from observed option prices act as the key predictors. The analysis indicates that the option-based multi-factor forecasting model outperforms other popular models in forecasting realized volatility of S&P 500 Index returns over most of the short-term horizons considered. The final essay investigates if a two-factor AJD model can fit option pricing patterns generated by a single-factor long memory volatility model. Our simulation experiments show that this model does well in this respect. Remarkably, however, at the fitted parameter values it does not generate the volatility auto-correlation patterns that are characteristic of long-memory volatility models.

40|$|The 'right' {{choice of}} {{instruments}} and modalities {{to provide aid}} to developing countries in support of poverty reduction and economic development {{is arguably the most}} contested issue in the current international debate on aid effectiveness. A particular controversy exists around the provision <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> in the form of budget support to avoid high transaction costs and other shortcomings <b>of</b> traditional project-based <b>aid.</b> Critics argue that this kind of 'programme aid' involves unacceptably high fiduciary risks due to the fungibility of budgetary funds. A more recently proposed form <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> is in the form <b>of</b> results-based <b>aid</b> or aid on delivery. Proponents argue that this provides donors with better control over the use <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> resources. This paper demonstrates in a simple principal-agent framework with asymmetric information that in the absence of transaction costs, for a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> combinations <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> dependency and recipient government commitment to reduce poverty, all three forms <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> are equivalent with regard to fungibility and fiduciary risks. The paper proceeds to demonstrate that as long as donors can rely on the recipient government to be at least minimally committed to poverty reduction, a well co-ordinated modality mix of general budget support and aid on delivery does not bear higher fiduciary risks than project aid. It concludes that if project aid does indeed involve higher transaction costs than budget support, donors should provide aid in the form of such a modality mix, albeit only if they are able (and willing) to closely co-ordinate their support...|$|R
