5|$|All {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} except the cockatiel {{are protected by}} the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which restricts import and export of wild-caught parrots to special licensed purposes. Five cockatoo species (including all subspecies)—the Tanimbar corella (Cacatua goffiniana), <b>red-vented</b> <b>cockatoo</b> (Cacatua haematuropygia), Moluccan cockatoo (Cacatua moluccensis), yellow-crested cockatoo (Cacatua sulphurea) and palm cockatoo (Probosciger aterrimus)—are protected on the CITES Appendix I list. With {{the exception of the}} cockatiel, all remaining cockatoo species are protected on the CITES Appendix II list.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{occupy a}} wide range of {{habitats}} from forests in subalpine regions to mangroves. However, no species is found in all types of habitat. The most widespread species, such as the galah and cockatiel, are open-country specialists that feed on grass seeds. They are often highly mobile fast flyers and are nomadic. Flocks of birds move across large areas of the inland, locating and feeding on seed and other food sources. Drought may force flocks from more arid areas to move further into farming areas. Other cockatoo species, such as the glossy black cockatoo, inhabit woodlands, rainforests, shrublands and even alpine forests. The <b>red-vented</b> <b>cockatoo</b> inhabits mangroves and its absence from northern Luzon {{may be related to the}} lack of mangrove forests there. Forest-dwelling cockatoos are generally sedentary, as the food supply is more stable and predictable. Several species have adapted well to human modified habitats and are found in agricultural areas and even busy cities.|$|E

The only ones on show are Ecuador Amazons. Most {{of the birds}} were moved to the Rare Parrot Breeding Centre from the old parrot house when it was demolished in 2005 {{to make way for}} Realm of the Red Ape.|$|R

50|$|<b>Red-vented</b> <b>cockatoos</b> were {{formerly}} {{widely distributed}} on all larger and many smaller {{islands of the}} Philippines, excluding northern and central Luzon. In the early 1990s the total wild population was estimated at 1000-4000. However, by 2008 this was reduced to probably less than 1000. Now remnant populations exist on the islands of Palawan, Tawitawi, Mindanao and Masbate. The species stronghold is the Palawan Faunal Region where the Katala Foundation has been running the Philippine cockatoo Conservation Programme since 1998. There are around 180 found in wilderness conservation in the municipality of Narra and Puerto Princesa, Palawan, particularly in Rasa Island. The efforts for conservation of the Katala Foundation are threatened by {{plans to build a}} coal-fired power station on Palawan's coast. Environmental organizations like the Katala Foundation or Rainforest Rescue are trying to prevent the construction.|$|R

50|$|The genus {{was first}} {{described}} by Brisson in 1790, {{with the white}} cockatoo (Cacatua alba) subsequently designated as the type species. Georges Cuvier defined the genus Kakatoe in 1800, with the <b>red-vented</b> <b>cockatoo</b> (C. haematuropygia) as the type, and some older bird books use the latter name. Mayr, Keast and Serventy validated Cacatua in 1964, and dismissed Kakatoe.|$|E

50|$|Cacatua is a genus of {{cockatoos}} found {{from the}} Philippines and Wallacea {{east to the}} Solomon Islands and south to Australia. They have a primarily white plumage (in some species tinged pinkish or yellow), an expressive crest, and a black (subgenus Cacatua) or pale (subgenus Licmetis) bill. Today several species from this genus are considered threatened due {{to a combination of}} habitat loss and capture for the wild bird trade, with the blue-eyed cockatoo, Moluccan cockatoo and umbrella cockatoo considered Vulnerable, and the <b>red-vented</b> <b>cockatoo</b> and yellow-crested cockatoo considered Critically Endangered.|$|E

Among the activities of the PCCP are nest protection, livelihood, habitat protection and restoration and conservation education.|$|E
5000|$|Rasa Island is {{a natural}} habitat of the {{globally}} threatened Philippine cockatoo, known locally as katala and {{also known as the}} <b>red-vented</b> <b>cockatoo,</b> a parrot species endemic to the Philippines. In order to protect this bird species whose number dropped sharply from as many as 4,000 in 1994 to only about 1,000 in 2001 due to illegal poaching and rapid deforestation of its coastal environment, the Philippine government declared the whole island and surrounding waters a bird sanctuary known as Rasa Island Wildlife Sanctuary. The [...] bird sanctuary is now administered by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in partnership with the Philippine Cockatoo Conservation Program of the Katala Foundation. Former poachers from the Tagbanua community of Narra now serve as the island's deputized wildlife wardens.|$|E
