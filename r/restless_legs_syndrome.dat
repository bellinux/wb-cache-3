40|$|Background. <b>Restless</b> <b>leg</b> <b>syndrome</b> (RLS) {{is one of}} the {{prevalent}} complaints of 					 patients with end stage renal diseases suffering chronic hemodialysis. Although there are some 					 known pharmacological managements for this syndrome, the adverse effect of drugs causes a 					 limitation for using them. In this randomized clinical trial we aimed to find a nonpharmacological 					 way to improve signs of <b>restless</b> <b>leg</b> <b>syndrome</b> and patients’ quality of life. 					 Material and Methods. Twenty-six patients were included in the 					 study and divided into 2 groups of control and exercise. The exercise group used 					 aerobic exercise during their hemodialysis for 16 weeks. The quality of life and severity 					 of <b>restless</b> <b>leg</b> <b>syndrome</b> were assessed at the first week of study and final week. Data 					 were analyzed using SPSS software. Results. The difference of means of 					 RLS signs at the first week of study and final week was in exercise group and in control group.

25|$|Fibromyalgia (FM) is {{a medical}} {{condition}} characterised by chronic widespread pain and a heightened pain response to pressure. Other symptoms include tiredness {{to a degree that}} normal activities are affected, sleep problems, and troubles with memory. Some people also report <b>restless</b> <b>legs</b> <b>syndrome,</b> bowel or bladder problems, numbness and tingling, and sensitivity to noise, lights or temperature. Fibromyalgia is frequently associated with depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Other types of chronic pain are also frequently present.|$|E
25|$|<b>Restless</b> <b>legs</b> <b>syndrome</b> (RLS) is a {{disorder}} that causes a strong urge to move one's legs. There {{is often an}} unpleasant feeling in the legs that improves somewhat with moving them. Occasionally the arms may also be affected. The feelings generally happen when at rest and therefore can {{make it hard to}} sleep. Due to the disturbance in sleep, people with RLS may have daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Additionally, many have limb twitching during sleep.|$|E

25|$|Medication {{is often}} not {{necessary}} in children as symptoms usually alleviate spontaneously as the child ages. However, because the disorder may affect wakeful behavior, many adults who continue to suffer from RMD may seek treatment. Benzodiazepines or tricyclic antidepressants have been considered as therapeutic options in managing the disorder. Infantile and adolescent RMD respond well to low doses of clonazepam. Prescription medications such as ropinirole or pramipexole given to <b>restless</b> <b>legs</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients do not show any clinical improvement in many patients with RMD.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam, first {{marketed as}} Valium, is a {{medication}} of the benzodiazepine family that typically produces a calming effect.

It can be taken by mouth, inserted into the rectum, injected into muscle, or injected into a vein. When given into a vein, effects begin in one to five minutes and last up to an hour. By mouth, effects may take 40 minutes to begin.|$|E
25|$|As an {{alternative}} to taking prescription drugs, some evidence shows that an average person seeking short-term help may find relief by taking over-the-counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine or doxylamine. Diphenhydramine and doxylamine are widely used in nonprescription sleep aids. They are the most effective over-the-counter sedatives currently available, at least in much of Europe, and in Canada, Australia, and the United States, and are more sedating than some prescription hypnotics. Antihistamine effectiveness for sleep may decrease over time, and anticholinergic side-effects (such as dry mouth) {{may also be a}} drawback with these particular drugs. While addiction {{does not seem to be}} an issue with this class of drugs, they can induce dependence and rebound effects upon abrupt cessation of use. However, people whose insomnia is caused by <b>restless</b> <b>legs</b> <b>syndrome</b> may have worsened symptoms with antihistamines.|$|E

500|$|Several {{important}} {{diseases of}} the nervous system are associated with dysfunctions of the dopamine system, and some of the key medications used to treat them work by altering the effects of dopamine. Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition causing tremor and motor impairment, is caused by a loss of dopamine-secreting neurons in an area of the midbrain called the substantia nigra. Its metabolic precursor L-DOPA can be manufactured, and in its pure form marketed as Levodopa is the most widely used treatment for the condition. There is evidence that schizophrenia involves altered levels of dopamine activity, and most antipsychotic drugs used to treat this are dopamine antagonists which reduce dopamine activity. Similar dopamine antagonist drugs are also some of the most effective anti-nausea agents. <b>Restless</b> <b>legs</b> <b>syndrome</b> and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are associated with decreased dopamine activity. [...] Dopaminergic stimulants can be addictive in high doses, but some are used at lower doses to treat ADHD. [...] Dopamine itself is available as a manufactured medication for intravenous injection: although it cannot reach the brain from the bloodstream, its peripheral effects make it useful in the treatment of heart failure or shock, especially in newborn babies.|$|E
50|$|Gabapentin may {{be useful}} in the {{treatment}} of comorbid anxiety in bipolar patients, (however not the bipolar state itself).Gabapentin may be effective in acquired pendular nystagmus and infantile nystagmus, (but not periodic alternating nystagmus). It is effective in hot flashes. It may be effective in reducing pain and spasticity in multiple sclerosis. Gabapentin may reduce symptoms of alcohol withdrawal (but it does not prevent the associated seizures). Use for smoking cessation has had mixed results. Gabapentin is effective in alleviating itching in kidney failure (uremic pruritus) and itching of other causes. It is an established treatment of <b>restless</b> <b>leg</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Gabapentin may help sleeping problems in people with <b>restless</b> <b>leg</b> <b>syndrome</b> and partial seizures.

40|$|Insomnia {{and limb}} pain are common {{problems}} in dialysis patients. In addition, <b>restless</b> <b>leg</b> <b>syndrome</b> (RLS) {{as a specific}} cause of insomnia and limb pain {{has been reported in}} many studies. The {{purpose of this study was}} to estimate incidence of insomnia and RLS as a cause of insomnia in these patients. Twenty-six patients undergoing hemodialysis were investigated for insomnia, limb pain and RLS as per the defined criteria. They were evaluated for dialysis quality, dialysis duration, hemoglobin, serum phosphorous, ionized calcium, iron and ferritin levels. These variables between patients with insomnia and those with normal sleep were evaluated by independent "t" test. Without considering the etiology or pathogenesis of insomnia, we evaluated the occurrence of insomnia and limb pain in these patients, and specifically, <b>restless</b> <b>leg</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Insomnia and limb pain were common in dialytic patients. 46 % of patients had insomnia. 91 % of sleepless group had limb pain as a persistent, annoying complaint. Limb pain was not seen in groups with a normal sleep pattern. <b>Restless</b> <b>leg</b> <b>syndrome</b> was found in 8 % of total cases (2 out of 26) and 17 % among the insomnia group (2 out of 12). In spite of high incidence of insomnia among patients undergoing regular hemodialysis, role of RLS is trivial.

2500|$|Diagnosis of Rhythmic Movement Disorder {{is done on}} an exclusionary {{basis in}} which other closely related {{movement}} disorders are systematically ruled out. Because of this, a thorough clinical evaluation is necessary. Often, impairments are not severe enough to warrant this process and so RMD is not often diagnosed unless there are extremely interfering or disabling symptoms. Many patients do not seek treatment for RMD directly and most seek professional help to alleviate sleep-affecting symptoms. To compound the issue, many sufferers are often misdiagnosed as having <b>Restless</b> <b>Legs</b> <b>Syndrome</b> or sleep apnea {{or some combination of}} the two. Rhythmic Movement Disorder differs from <b>Restless</b> <b>Legs</b> <b>Syndrome</b> in that RMD involves involuntary contractions of muscles with no urge or uncomfortable sensation to provoke such movement. Additionally, 80-90% of <b>Restless</b> <b>Legs</b> <b>Syndrome</b> sufferers show periodic limb movements as observed on a polysomnogram, which are not common in RMD patients. Rhythmic Movement Disorder can also have symptoms that overlap with epilepsy. However, use of a polysomnogram can help distinguish one disorder from the other as RMD involves movements in both REM and NREM sleep, which is unusual for seizures ...|$|E
2500|$|Rhythmic Movement Disorder (or RMD) is a {{neurological}} disorder characterized by involuntary (however may sometimes be voluntary), repetitive movements of large muscle groups immediately {{before and during}} sleep often involving the head and neck. It was independently described first in 1905 by Zappert as jactatio capitis nocturna and by Cruchet as rhythmie du sommeil. The majority of RMD episodes occur during NREM sleep, although REM movements have been reported. RMD {{is often associated with}} other psychiatric conditions or mental retardation. The disorder often leads to bodily injury from unwanted movements. Because of these incessant muscle contractions, patients’ sleep patterns are often disrupted. It differs from <b>Restless</b> <b>Legs</b> <b>Syndrome</b> in that RMD involves involuntary muscle contractions before and during sleep while <b>Restless</b> <b>Legs</b> <b>Syndrome</b> is the urge to move before sleep. RMD occurs in both males and females, often during early childhood with symptoms diminishing with age. Many sufferers also have other sleep related disorders, like sleep apnea. The disorder can be differentially diagnosed into small subcategories, including sleep related bruxism, thumb sucking, hypnagonic foot tremor, and rhythmic sucking, to name a few. In order to be considered pathological, the ICSD-II requires that in the sleep-related rhythmic movements should “markedly interfere with normal sleep, cause significant impairment in daytime function, or result in self-inflicted bodily injury that requires medical treatment (or would result in injury if preventive measures were not used)” ...|$|E
