5|$|Hypogeomys australis was {{described}} in 1903 by Guillaume Grandidier from subfossil material collected in the cave of Andrahomana in southeastern Madagascar. The Hypogeomys material {{was similar to the}} living Hypogeomys antimena, but distinct enough for Grandidier to <b>recognize</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a separate species, different in size and some morphological details. Grandidier described another subfossil Hypogeomys species in 1912, H.boulei, but the material that species was based on was later identified as the enigmatic mammal Plesiorycteropus. In 1946, Charles Lamberton illustrated another femur (upper leg bone) of H.australis; the origin and current whereabouts of this specimen are unknown. In 1996, Steven Goodman and Daniel Rakotondravony reviewed the distribution of Hypogeomys and confirmed that H.australis is a distinct species. H.australis and H.antimena are classified together within the exclusively Madagascan subfamily Nesomyinae of the family Nesomyidae, which includes various African rodents.|$|E
5|$|The labor {{situation}} in Jerome was complicated. Three separate labor unions—the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (MMSW), the Industrial Workers of the World or IWW, and the Liga Protectora Latina, which represented about 500 Mexican miners—had members in Jerome. In 1917, two miners' strikes involving the IWW, {{which had been}} organizing strikes elsewhere in Arizona and other states, took place in Jerome. Seen as a threat by business interests {{as well as other}} labor unions, the Wobblies, as they were called, were subject nationally to sometimes violent harassment. The MMSW, which in May called a strike against United Verde, regarded the rival IWW with animosity and would not <b>recognize</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> legitimate. In response, the IWW members threatened to break the strike. Under pressure, the MMSW voted 467 to 431 to settle for less than they wanted.|$|E

25|$|In July 1913, locals of the Western Federation of Miners {{called a}} general strike against all mines in the Michigan Copper Country. The strike was called without {{approval}} by the national WFM, which was extremely low on funds after the recent strikes in the west. The union supported the strike, but faced great difficulties providing pay and supplies to the strikers. Hundreds of strikers surrounded the mine shafts to prevent others from reporting to work. Almost all mines shut down, although the workers {{were said to be}} sharply divided on the strike question. The union demanded an 8-hour day, a minimum wage of $3 per day, an end to use of the one-man drill, and that the companies <b>recognize</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the employees’ representative.|$|E

He based his decision on his view that the Social Republic government was illegal and that Italys legitimate government remained the Kingdom of Italy, which controlled {{the southern part of}} the country and had switched sides and joined the Allies. As a result of his stance, an Italian Social Republic military tribunal in Parma convicted him of high treason and condemned him to death. The Social Republic offered him a pardon on the condition that he <b>recognize</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> Italys legitimate government, but he rejected the pardon and was executed along with Contrammiraglio Luigi Mascherpa and others by a firing squad composed of youths aged 17 and 18 in the city square at Parma on 24 May 1944.|$|E

25|$|In 1956, C. V. Morton {{pointed out}} that, as A.pinnatifidum had {{been shown to}} arise from {{hybridization}} between walking fern and mountain spleenwort, it would constitute an intergeneric hybrid if walking fern {{was placed in the}} genus Camptosorus (as Camptosorus rhizophyllus). The hybrid genus ×Asplenosorus had been published, but Morton noted that it lacked a Latin diagnosis and was therefore invalid under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature; he preferred to continue recognizing Asplenium pinnatifidum in Asplenium. The ICBN's rules were relaxed in 1972, and in 1974, John Mickel published Asplenosorus pinnatifidus as a new combination for the species to allow the continued recognition of Camptosorus. Since then, phylogenetic studies have shown that Camptosorus nests within Asplenium, and current treatments do not <b>recognize</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a separate genus.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} calpain {{originates}} in 1964, when calcium-dependent proteolytic activities {{caused by a}} “calcium-activated neutral protease” (CANP) were detected in brain, lens of the eye and other tissues. In the late 1960s the enzymes were isolated and characterised independently in both rat brain and skeletal muscle. These activities were caused by an intracellular cysteine protease not associated with the lysosome and having an optimum activity at neutral pH, which clearly distinguished it from the cathepsin family of proteases. The calcium-dependent activity, intracellular localization, along with the limited, specific proteolysis on its substrates, highlighted calpain’s role as a regulatory, rather than a digestive protease. When the sequence of this enzyme became known, it was given the name “calpain”, to <b>recognize</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a hybrid of two well-known proteins at the time, the calcium-regulated signalling protein, calmodulin, and the cysteine protease of papaya, papain. Shortly thereafter, the activity {{was found to be}} attributable to two main isoforms, dubbed μ("mu")-calpain and m-calpain (a.k.a. calpain I and II), that differed primarily in their calcium requirements in vitro. Their names reflect {{the fact that they are}} activated by micro- and nearly millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ within the cell, respectively.|$|E

Although the site provides no Internet access of any kind to inmates, it has often been called the MySpace and Facebook for inmates by the media. Because the business is housed online and includes inmate profiles, it has been compared to social media; however, most agencies <b>recognize</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> promoting traditional pen-pal postal mail because the site provides no mechanism for inmates to access the site online. By 2003, the site had about 10,000 hits per day and presented profiles from inmates in about a dozen countries. Inmates using WriteAPrisoner.com only have access to postal mail. The site charges inmates $40 per year to post their profile and photo, which are viewed by the public at no cost. The site encourages writing directly to inmates or sending a first message through its free e-mail forwarding service.

25|$|In 1953, Herb Wagner {{showed that}} the fertile {{population}} in Havana Glen was tetraploid, while ordinary Aspleniumebenoides was diploid. Wagner and Robert S. Whitmire followed up in 1957 and induced chromosome doubling in diploid A.ebenoides collected in Maryland, and produced fertile, allotetraploid offspring, the first allopolyploid ferns to be artificially produced in culture. There were significant morphological differences between these artificially produced ferns and those from Havana Glen. Wagner and Whitmire attributed this {{to the fact that}} the presumed ancestral diploid at Havana Glen and those in Maryland had originated in separate hybridization events between A.platyneuron and A.rhizophyllum and that alloploidy might magnify genetic differences between the parental species. In reviewing the characteristics of the species in 1982, Wagner and his collaborators noted that as a hybrid, the name of the species was more correctly written Asplenium×ebenoides, according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. However, they preferred to use Wherry's combination of ×Asplenosorus ebenoides. (A change in the ICBN in 1972 rendered a Latin diagnosis for ×Asplenosorus unnecessary.) Since then, phylogenetic studies have shown that Camptosorus nests within Asplenium, and current treatments do not <b>recognize</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> a separate genus.|$|E
25|$|His first {{practical}} application was to heat water for his revolving engine. He observed that passing steam over burning coal or tar caused the flames to burn brighter and without smoke, and he theorized that the steam was decomposed in this process. Word of these experiments reached the eminent French chemist Gay-Lussac, and he commented {{on them in}} Annales de Chimie et de Physique in 1819. He contended that the temperature was insufficient to cause decomposition. Instead, the steam freed more flammable vapors in the fuel causing the flame's change. Morey was correct. He produced what {{is now known as}} town gas. The oxygen from the water combines with carbon from the fuel to form carbon monoxide and the hydrogen forms a diatomic molecule. Both later burn to form water and carbon dioxide. Morey was not the first to use water-gas for lighting, and his devices, including the patented 1818 American Water Burner, simply used the gas immediately instead of piping it to be burnt elsewhere, done as early as 1792 in England. Morey apparently did not know of this advance or at least did not <b>recognize</b> <b>it</b> <b>as</b> the same process. Strangely, in 1819 J. F. Dana of Dartmouth and Harvard proposed attaching steam boilers to street lamps to take advantage of Morey's discovery, but water-gas was already being piped to some London street lamps from a central source in 1812. Still, Morey's device did produce more light, and there is evidence that it resulted in more efficient combustion.|$|E
