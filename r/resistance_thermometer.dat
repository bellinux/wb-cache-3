40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of an {{investigation}} of the stability of a selection of small industrial platinum <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometers</b> (IPRTs) upon heat treatment and handling. Ninety-four IPRTs, of several models, obtained from five manufacturers were studied. Most of the IPRTs exhibited calibration drifts and also effects due to the presence of moisture or strain. There was no apparent improvement in the stability if the resistance ratio, R(t) /Ro = W(t), instead of resistance were used as the criterion. Comparisons are made of the relative stability of the products of the five companies.

50|$|Extrinsic {{fiber optic}} sensors provide {{excellent}} protection of measurement signals against noise corruption. Unfortunately, many conventional sensors produce electrical output {{which must be}} converted into an optical signal for use with fiber. For example, {{in the case of}} a platinum <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometer,</b> the temperature changes are translated into resistance changes. The PRT must therefore have an electrical power supply. The modulated voltage level at the output of the PRT can then be injected into the optical fiber via the usual type of transmitter. This complicates the measurement process and means that low-voltage power cables must be routed to the transducer.|$|E
50|$|A {{thermometer}} calibrated to a known {{fixed point}} is accurate (i.e. gives a true reading) at that point. Most thermometers are originally calibrated to a constant-volume gas thermometer. In between fixed calibration points, interpolation is used, usually linear. This may give {{significant differences between}} different types of thermometer at points {{far away from the}} fixed points. For example, the expansion of mercury in a glass thermometer is slightly different from the change in resistance of a platinum <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometer,</b> so these two will disagree slightly at around 50 °C. There may be other causes due to imperfections in the instrument, e.g. in a liquid-in-glass thermometer if the capillary tube varies in diameter.|$|E
50|$|Generally, as a {{real gas}} {{increases}} in density -which may indicate an increase in pressure- its ability to conduct heat increases. In this type of gauge, a wire filament is heated by running current through it. A thermocouple or <b>resistance</b> <b>thermometer</b> (RTD) can then be {{used to measure the}} temperature of the filament. This temperature is dependent on {{the rate at which the}} filament loses heat to the surrounding gas, and therefore on the thermal conductivity. A common variant is the Pirani gauge, which uses a single platinum filament as both the heated element and RTD. These gauges are accurate from 10&minus;3 Torr to 10 Torr, but their calibration is sensitive to the chemical composition of the gases being measured.|$|E
