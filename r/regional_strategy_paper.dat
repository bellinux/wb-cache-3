The goals: The main goal of the thesis is to explore the approach of regional authorities to the issue of families at risk and what forms this approach. Methods: The research was divided into two parts. Firstly the case studies of thirteen regions (except Prague) were elaborated. Based on these studies, 4 regions were chosen, 2 as examples of good practice, other 2 as examples of bad practices. In these four regions, qualitative semi-structured interviews were done. As respondents a councillor and an officer of regional authority office were chosen. 7 interviews were finally made, 2 respondents answered by email. Outcomes: We can find family as a target group in most of regional plans for the development of social services, but it is usually not a priority. The family <b>regional</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>papers</b> were elaborated only in 5 regions, but not all of them are focused also on families at risk.

40|$|The {{failure of}} the colonial {{government}} to develop the economic sector for this state {{was due to the}} adoption of a biased development approach. The biased approach focused on the potential of existing urban areas, and on economic growth oriented rather than distributed growth. Various economic development projects had been implemented since Sarawak became part of Malaysia. As the biggest state in the country with multi-ethnic population, Sarawak definitely needs more strategic development approach and attention from the central government. The Ninth Malaysia Plan has shown that spatial inequality in Sarawak has widened and needs attention. The launching of Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy (SCORE) marked the shift to the new approach of development in improving the spatial inequality in Sarawak through <b>regional</b> development <b>strategy.</b> This <b>paper</b> discusses the spatial inequality in Sarawak and explore the potential role of SCORE in regional development...|$|R

Processes of prioritisation for access to water often lack equity, represent the interests of industrial demands, and marginalize interests and water needs of the poor. <b>Regional</b> Poverty Reduction <b>Strategy</b> <b>Papers</b> are based on traditional economic indicators and give scant attention to the poverty and forest resource nexus and therefore inadequately reflect the actual and potential role of forest resources in alleviating rural poverty. Poverty related issues were once perceived as solely the domain of government ministries responsible for social affairs.

40|$|This book {{presents}} a proposed method {{for the implementation}} of the Participatory Poverty Assessment (PPA) within a framework of composing a <b>regional</b> Poverty Reduction <b>Strategy</b> <b>Paper</b> (PRSP), especially at the district level. To synergize poverty prevention strategies, programs and policies, the Indonesian goverment has stated its commitment to develop a national PRSP that will accommodate the formulation of a long term national poverty reduction strategy. Meanwhile, along with the implementation of regional autonomy that provides greater authority to the regions to create policy that is appropriate with regional conditions, a regional PRSP is needed, both on a provincial and a district level. The development of a regional PRSP {{needs to be done in}} a participatory fashion in order to produce a well-targeted poverty reduction strategy and policy, which is more accommodative in meeting the needs and local socio-cultural circumstances. This volume is intended to provide a practical guide for district government in implementing and developing regional PRSP in a participatory way...|$|R
40|$|In 2009, the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) {{agreed to}} include an Urban and <b>Regional</b> <b>Strategy</b> {{as part of the}} Indigenous Reform Agreement aimed at {{coordinating}} the delivery of services to Indigenous Australians. The main purpose of this strategy was to ensure that government agencies and community groups form partnerships to develop implementation plans for coordinated actions in relation to the headline indicators of the COAG Closing the Gap targets. Of particular interest were the dynamics operating within regional areas, given that these account for around 50 per cent of the national Indigenous population. These are significant service centres located geographically between metropolitan areas and remote Australia. They have extensive catchment areas from which they are drawing in Indigenous people as migrants as part of a step-wise movement of population out of remote locations. Combined with higher natural population increase, this stands in contrast to non-Indigenous out-migration and population ageing. From an Indigenous policy perspective, {{and in terms of the}} COAG Urban and <b>Regional</b> <b>Strategy,</b> they register as demographic 2 ̆ 7 hotspots 2 ̆ 7 in the sense that demographic processes are generating specific outcomes that require place-based policy responses. In order to understand these processes more fully and their particular implications for policy, this paper focuses on one such location (Port Augusta) as a case study of the changes that are underway in demographic composition more widely, and of the issues that are increasingly faced by all levels of government and local Indigenous organisations in dealing with them. The aim is to drill down into the population dynamics of Port Augusta and into the community responses to demographic change as a way of deriving general lessons for community governance and service delivery that are likely to be faced in similar situations by those seeking to implement the Urban and <b>Regional</b> <b>strategy.</b> The <b>paper</b> is presented in two separate but linked components. First of all, recent population trends in Port Augusta are established pointing out the very different trajectories for the Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations, and leading to a set of estimates of current Indigenous social and economic outcomes. The second part outlines government and community responses to these trends and outcomes: it highlights lessons learnt from Port Augusta itself and from other attempts around the country that have sought to establish appropriate governance arrangements for local community planning...|$|R

40|$|This study {{addresses}} why multinational enterprises (MNEs) {{in emerging}} economies establish regional headquarters outside {{their home countries}} but within their home regions – an important question that previous studies have largely ignored.

Using survey data from 226 Chinese MNEs, we find that intraregional FDI and interregional exports encourage MNEs to build Asian regional headquarters (ARHQ). Furthermore, we find that home-city regional integration moderates the relationship between interregional exports and ARHQ establishment and that MNEs’ international management capability moderates the relationship between intraregional FDI and ARHQ establishment.

However, oral health {{is seen as a}} very low priority in the African Region, where extreme poverty means that the limited resources available to the health sector are directed towards life-threatening conditions such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. The mission of the Oral Health Programme at the Regional Office of WHO for Africa is to assist Member States to achieve those goals by means of a <b>Regional</b> <b>Strategy.</b> In fact in September 1998, the WHO Regional Committee for Africa adopted a ten year (1999 - 2008) Oral Health Plan for the African Region (AFR/RC 48 / 9) with the aim of fundamentally improving community oral health. Its cornerstone is provision of the technical and managerial resources to efficiently and effectively deliver affordable intervention that matches the oral health needs of the community. Data Sources: This review presents major achievements made since the WHO <b>Regional</b> <b>Strategy</b> was launched in 1998 and priority actions which should be taken to further implement the <b>Regional</b> <b>Strategy.</b> Conclusions: WHO/AFRO recommends more commitment at country level to improve oral health and to reinforce partnerships in order to mobilize and coordinate the human, financial, material and institutional resources needed to implement, monitor and evaluate the <b>Regional</b> <b>Strategy...</b>|$|R
