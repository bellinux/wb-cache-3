5000|$|Any {{vacuum tube}} {{operating}} at several thousand volts or more can produce X-rays as an unwanted byproduct, raising safety issues. [...] The higher the voltage, the more penetrating the resulting radiation {{and the more}} the hazard. CRT displays, once common in color televisions and computer displays, operate at 3-40 kilovolts, making them the main concern among household appliances. Historically, concern has focused less on the cathode ray tube, since its thick glass envelope is impregnated with several pounds of lead for shielding, than on high voltage (HV) rectifier and voltage regulator tubes inside. In the late 1960s {{it was found that}} a failure in the HV supply circuit of some General Electric TVs could leave excessive voltages on the <b>regulator</b> <b>tube,</b> causing it to emit X-rays. The models were recalled and the ensuing scandal caused the US agency responsible for regulating this hazard, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to require that all TVs include circuits to prevent excessive voltages in the event of failure. The hazard associated with excessive voltages was eliminated with the advent of all solid state TVs, which have no tubes beside the CRT. Since 1969 the FDA has limited TV X-ray emission to 0.5 mR (milliroentgen) per hour. The flat screens used today do not have any vacuum tubes capable of emitting X-rays.|$|E

A Dekatron is a cold-cathode tube with multiple electrodes that is used for counting.

50|$|In the 1930s, tubes {{often had}} the {{connection}} to the control grid brought out through a metal top cap {{on the top of}} the tube. This was connected by using a clip with an attached wire lead. An example would be the 6A7 pentagrid converter. Later, some tubes, particularly those used as radio frequency (RF) power amplifiers or horizontal deflection amplifiers in TV sets, such as the 6DQ6, had the plate or anode lead protrude through the envelope. In both cases this allowed the tube's output circuitry to be isolated from the input (grid) circuit more effectively. In the case of the tubes with the plate brought out to a cap, this also allowed the plate to run at higher voltages (over 26,000 volts in the case of rectifiers for color television, such as the 3A3, as well as high-voltage <b>regulator</b> <b>tubes.)</b> A few unusual tubes had caps for both grid and plate; the caps were symmetrically placed, with divergent axes.|$|R

40|$|Background: Inadequate {{infection}} control knowledge about enteral feeding (EF) practices among nursing home staff {{may lead to}} contamination of EF systems. Aim: To investigate the effectiveness of an {{infection control}} programme (ICP) on knowledge and practice of EF of nursing home staff, and to explore {{the correlation between the}} ICP and bacterial contamination of the hands of staff and feeding equipment. Methods: Using a quasi-experimental pre-post-test control design, each intervention and control group consisted of 15 residents and 10 staff. EF knowledge and practice were assessed by questionnaire and observation. The intervention group received an ICP. Samples were collected from the hands of staff, enteral feed, flow <b>regulators,</b> feeding <b>tube</b> hubs, and the nasopharynx and gastric fluid of residents, and analysed for total bacterial counts and presence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) before and after the ICP. Findings: The intervention group showed a significant improvement in knowledge and practice after the ICP (P 104 colony-forming units/mL. Contamination was significantly lower in the post-test samples of the intervention group (P < 0. 05), and remained unchanged in the control group. The mean (± standard deviation) number of MRSA-positive samples decreased from 2. 1 ± 1. 6 to 0. 4 ± 0. 7 (P < 0. 05) in the intervention group. MRSA hand contamination was highly correlated with contamination of <b>regulators,</b> gastric fluid, <b>tube</b> hubs and enteral feed (P < 0. 05), illustrating the close relationship between contaminated feed and poor hand hygiene.

50|$|Dullard is {{a member}} of DXDX(T/V) {{phosphatase}} family. It was shown in 2002 to be a potential <b>regulator</b> of neural <b>tube</b> development in Xenopus. Neural development happens in the dorsal ectoderm. In the genus Xenopus, over expression of Dullard undergoes apoptosis in early development. Dullard helps promote Ubiquitin by proteosomal degradation. Dullard mRNA is derived from maternal genes and is localized within the animal neural hemisphere. Functioning negatively for the regulation of Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (BMPs), Dullard conserves the C-terminal region of NLI-IF, in which is fairly dominant in cellular functions. Dullard is essential for inhibiting BMP receptor activation during Xenopus neuralization.|$|R

Here, we report the identification of a central cell guidance (ccg) mutant, which is defective in micropylar pollen tube guidance. CCG encodes a nuclear protein with an N-terminal conserved zinc beta-ribbon domain that is functionally interchangeable with that of TFIIB in yeast. This suggests that CCG might act as a transcription <b>regulator</b> for pollen <b>tube</b> guidance. CCG is expressed in the central cell of the female gametophyte.

40|$|A newly {{emerging}} {{family of}} phosphatases that {{are members of}} the haloacid dehalogenase superfamily contains the catalytic motif DXDX(T/V). A member of this DXDX(T/V) phosphatase family known as Dullard was recently shown to be a potential <b>regulator</b> of neural <b>tube</b> development in Xenopus [Satow R, Chan TC, Asashima M (2002) Biochem Biophys Res Commun 295 : 85 – 91]. Herein, we demonstrate that human Dullard and the yeast protein Nem 1 p perform similar functions in mammalian cells and yeast cells, respectively. In addition to similarity in primary sequence, Dullard and Nem 1 p possess similar domains and show similar substrate preferences, and both localize to the nuclear envelope. Additionally, we show that human Dullard can rescue the aberrant nuclear envelope morphology of nem 1 Δ yeast cells, functionally replacing Nem 1 p. Finally, Nem 1 p, has been shown to deposphorylate the yeast phosphatidic acid phosphatase Smp 2 p [Santos-Rosa H, Leung J, Grimsey N, Peak-Chew S, Siniossoglou S (2005) EMBO J 24 : 1931 – 1941], and we show that Dullard dephosphorylates the mammalian phospatidic acid phosphatase, lipin.

40|$|Networks of {{epithelial}} and endothelial {{tubes are}} essential for the function of organs such as the lung, kidney, and vascular system. The sizes and shapes of these tubes are highly regulated to match their individual functions. Defects in tube size can cause debilitating diseases such as polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and ischemia 1, 2. It is therefore critical to understand how tube dimensions are regulated. Here we identify the tyrosine kinase Src as an instructive <b>regulator</b> of epithelial <b>tube</b> length in the Drosophila tracheal system. Loss-of-function Src 42 mutations shorten tracheal tubes while Src 42 over-expression elongates them. Surprisingly, Src 42 acts distinctly from known tube size pathways and regulates both the amount of apical surface growth and, with the conserved formin dDaam, the direction of growth. Quantitative 3 -D image analysis reveals that Src 42 and dDaam mutant tracheal cells expand more in the circumferential than the axial dimension, resulting in tubes that are shorter in length – but larger in diameter – than WT tubes. Thus, Src 42 and dDaam control tube dimensions by regulating the direction of anisotropic growth, a mechanism that has not previously been described. The Drosophila tracheal system is a gas exchange organ that arises from clusters o...|$|R
40|$|In cells, {{membrane}} {{tubes are}} extracted by molecular motors. Although individual motors cannot provide enough force {{to pull a}} tube, clusters of such motors can. Here,weinvestigate, using a minimal in vitro model system, how the tube pulling process depends on fundamental properties of the motor species involved. Previously, {{it has been shown}} that processive motors can pull tubes by dynamic association at the tube tip. We demonstrate that, remarkably, nonprocessive motors can also cooperatively extract tubes. Moreover, the tubes pulled by nonprocessive motors exhibit rich dynamics as compared to those pulled by their processive counterparts. We report distinct phases of persistent growth, retraction, and an intermediate regime characterized by highly dynamic switching between the two. We interpret the different phases in the context of a single-species model. The model assumes only a simple motor clustering mechanism along the length of the entire tube and the presence of a length-dependent tube tension. The resulting dynamic distribution of motor clusters acts as both a velocity and distance <b>regulator</b> for the <b>tube.</b> We show the switching phase to be an attractor of the dynamics of this model, suggesting that the switching observed experimentally is a robust characteristic of nonprocessive motors. A similar system could regulate in vivo biological membrane networks...|$|R
50|$|The {{transformer}} can {{be equipped}} with extra windings whose sole purpose {{is to have a}} relatively large voltage pulse induced in them when the magnetic field collapses as the input switch is turned off. There is considerable energy stored in the magnetic field and coupling it out via extra windings helps it to collapse quickly, and avoids the voltage flash over that might otherwise occur. The pulse train coming from the flyback transformer windings is converted to direct current by a simple half wave rectifier. There is no point in using a full wave design as there are no corresponding pulses of opposite polarity. One turn of a winding often produces pulses of several volts. In older television designs, the transformer produced the required high voltage for the CRT accelerating voltage directly with the output rectified by a simple rectifier. In more modern designs, the rectifier is replaced by a voltage multiplier. Color television sets also have to use a regulator to control the high voltage. The earliest sets used a shunt vacuum <b>tube</b> <b>regulator,</b> but the introduction of solid state sets employed a simpler voltage dependant resistor. The rectified voltage is then used to supply the final anode of the cathode ray tube.|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} endothelial cell (EC) –generated {{vascular}} guidance tunnels (ie, matrix spaces created during tube formation) serve as conduits for the recruitment and motility of pericytes along EC ablumenal surfaces to facilitate vessel maturation events, including vascular basement membrane matrix assembly and restriction of EC tube diameter. During quail development, pericyte recruitment along microvascular tubes directly correlates with vascular basement membrane matrix deposition. Pericyte recruitment to EC tubes leads to specific induction of fibronectin and nidogen- 1 (ie, matrix-bridging proteins that link together basement membrane components) {{as well as}} perlecan and laminin isoforms. Coincident with these events, up-regulation of integrins, α 5 β 1, α 3 β 1, α 6 β 1, and α 1 β 1, which bind fibronectin, nidogens, laminin isoforms, and collagen type IV, occurs in EC-pericyte cocultures, but not EC-only cultures. Integrin-blocking antibodies to these receptors, disruption of fibronectin matrix assembly, and small interfering RNA suppression of pericyte tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP) - 3 (a known <b>regulator</b> of vascular <b>tube</b> stabilization) all lead to decreased EC basement membrane, resulting in increased vessel lumen diameter, a key indicator of dysfunctional EC-pericyte interactions. Thus, pericyte recruitment to EC-lined tubes during vasculogenesis is a stimulatory event controlling vascular basement membrane matrix assembly, a fundamental maturation step regulating the transition from vascular morphogenesis to stabilization...|$|R
40|$|Rapid Alkalinization Factors (RALFs) are plant {{peptides}} that rapidly {{increase the}} pH of plant suspension cell culture medium and inhibit root growth. A pollen-specific tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) RALF (SlPRALF) has been identified. The SlPRALF gene encodes a preproprotein {{that appears to}} be processed and released from the pollen tube as an active peptide. A synthetic SlPRALF peptide based on the putative active peptide did not affect pollen hydration or viability but inhibited the elongation of normal pollen tubes in an in vitro growth system. Inhibitory effects of SlPRALF were detectable at concentrations as low as 10 nm, and complete inhibition was observed at 1 μm peptide. At least 10 -fold higher levels of alkSlPRALF, which lacks disulfide bonds, were required to see similar effects. A greater effect of peptide was observed in low-pH-buffered medium. Inhibition of pollen tube elongation was reversible if peptide was removed within 15 min of exposure. Addition of 100 nm SlPRALF to actively growing pollen tubes inhibited further elongation until tubes were 40 to 60 μm in length, after which pollen tubes became resistant to the peptide. The onset of resistance correlated with the timing of the exit of the male germ unit from the pollen grain into the tube. Thus, exogenous SlPRALF acts as a negative <b>regulator</b> of pollen <b>tube</b> elongation within a specific developmental window...|$|R
40|$|Calcium {{is a key}} <b>regulator</b> of pollen <b>tube</b> growth, {{but little}} is known {{concerning}} the downstream components of the signaling pathways involved. We identified two pollen-expressed calmodulin-like domain protein kinases from Petunia inflata, CALMODULIN-LIKE DOMAIN PROTEIN KINASE 1 (Pi CDPK 1) and Pi CDPK 2. Transient overexpression or expression of catalytically modified Pi CDPK 1 disrupted pollen tube growth polarity, whereas expression of Pi CDPK 2 constructs inhibited tube growth but not polarity. Pi CDPK 1 exhibited plasma membrane localization most likely mediated by acylation, and we present evidence that suggests this localization {{is critical to the}} biological function of this kinase. Pi CDPK 2 substantially localized to as yet unidentified internal membrane compartments, and this localization was again, at least partially, mediated by acylation. In contrast with Pi CDPK 1, altering the localization of Pi CDPK 2 did not noticeably alter the effect of overexpressing this isoform on pollen tube growth. Ca 2 + requirements for Pi CDPK 1 activation correlated closely with Ca 2 + concentrations measured in the growth zone at the pollen tube apex. Interestingly, loss of polarity associated with overexpression of Pi CDPK 1 was associated with elevated cytosolic Ca 2 + throughout the bulging tube tip, suggesting that Pi CDPK 1 may participate in maintaining Ca 2 + homeostasis. These results are discussed in relation to previous models for Ca 2 + regulation of pollen tube growth...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2005 ROP GTPases {{are crucial}} <b>regulators</b> of pollen <b>tube</b> growth. The Rop GTPase family in maize {{consists}} of nine known rop genes, ropl-rop 9. A subset of these genes (rop 2, rop 8, and rop 9) {{are expressed in}} pollen. The rop 2 and rop 9 genes are a highly conserved duplicate gene pair of ancient origin. The rop 2 /rop 9 duplicate gene pair displays differential expression in mature and germinated pollen, suggesting different roles for the genes {{in the process of}} male gametophyte development. To explore ROP 2 function in maize, five Mutator transposon insertions in the rop 2 gene were isolated (rop 2 ::Mu alleles). I showed that three of the rop 2 ::Mu alleles displayed reduced transmission through the male and were associated with reduced levels of ROP 2 -mRNA. Interestingly, the rop 2 ::Mu male-specific transmission defect was apparent only when wild-type pollen was also present, an indication that the mutation reduces the competitive ability of the rop 2 gametophytes. Dual pollination and pollen mixing experiments indicated that this competitive disadvantage is expressed by the majority of the mutant gametophytes, and that expression of the phenotype is associated with a delay in the ability to accomplish fertilization. Using the waxy phenotypic marker (linked to rop 2 via a reciprocal translocation) to distinguish between rop 2 ::Mu and wild-type pollen derived from heterozygous plants, I demonstrated that the delay is associated with a defect in early progamic development (i. e, germination and early pollen tube growth). The defect was detectable in vivo as early as 15 minutes after pollination. However, quantitative measurements provided no indication that the rop 2 mutation affects pollen tube growth in the style. Finally, investigations focusing on the final stages of pollen function raise the possibility that a defect in the very last stages (i. e. either pollen tube guidance through the micropyle to the egg sac, or fertilization of the egg sac) may also contribute to the rop 2 mutant delay. This work provides direct in vivo evidence confirming a role for Rop in male gametophyte development, and is the first study to demonstrate a role for Rop {{in the early stages of}} post-pollination gametophytic function...|$|R

High pressure piping must conform with FESHM chapter 5031. 1. Piping lines with ratings greater than 150 psig have a pressure test done before the line is put into service. These tests require the use of pressure testing permits. It is my intent that all pressure piping over which my group has responsibility conforms to the chapter. This includes the liquid argon and liquid helium and liquid nitrogen cryogenic systems. It also includes the high pressure air system, and the high pressure gas piping of the WAMUS and MDT gas systems. This is not an all inclusive compilation of test documentation. Some piping tests have their own engineering note. Other piping section test permits are included in separate safety review documents. So if it isn't here, that doesn't mean that it wasn't tested. D-Zero has a back up air supply system to add reliability to air compressor systems. The system includes high pressure piping which requires a review per FESHM 5031. 1. The core system consists of a pressurized tube trailer, supply piping into the building and a pressure reducing regulator tied into the air compressor system discharge piping. Air flows from the trailer if the air compressor discharge pressure drops below the <b>regulator</b> setting. The <b>tube</b> trailer is periodically pumped back up to approximately 2000 psig. A high pressure compressor housed in one of the exterior buildings is used for that purpose.

40|$|Pollen tube {{elongation}} is a rapid tip growth {{process that}} is driven by a dynamic actin cytoskeleton. A ubiquitous family of actin binding proteins, actin-depolymerizing factors (ADFs) /cofilins, bind to actin filaments, induce severing, enhance depolymerization from their slow-growing end, and are important for maintaining actin dynamics in vivo. ADFs/cofilins are regulated by multiple mechanisms, among which Rho small GTPase-activated phosphorylation at a terminal region Ser residue {{plays an important role}} in regulating their actin binding and depolymerizing activity, affecting actin reorganization. We have shown previously that a tobacco pollen-specific ADF, NtADF 1, is important for maintaining normal pollen tube actin cytoskeleton organization and growth. Here, we show that tobacco pollen grains accumulate phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated forms of ADFs, suggesting that phosphorylation could be a regulatory mechanism for their activity. In plants, Rho-related Rac/Rop GTPases have been shown to be important <b>regulators</b> for pollen <b>tube</b> growth. Overexpression of Rac/Rop GTPases converts polar growth into isotropic growth, resulting in pollen tubes with ballooned tips and a disrupted actin cytoskeleton. Using the Rac/Rop GTPase-induced defective pollen tube phenotype as a functional assay, we show that overexpression of NtADF 1 suppresses the ability of NtRac 1, a tobacco Rac/Rop GTPase, to convert pollen tube tip growth to isotropic growth. This finding suggests that NtADF 1 acts in a common pathway with NtRac 1 to regulate pollen tube growth. A mutant form of NtADF 1 with a nonphosphorylatable Ala substitution at its Ser- 6 position [NtADF 1 (S 6 A) ] shows increased activity, whereas the mutant NtADF 1 (S 6 D), which has a phospho-mimicking Asp substitution at the same position, shows reduced ability to counteract the effect of NtRac 1. These observations suggest that phosphorylation at Ser- 6 of NtADF 1 could be important for its integration into the NtRac 1 signaling pathway. Moreover, overexpression of NtRac 1 diminishes the actin binding activity of green fluorescent protein (GFP) -NtADF 1 but has little effect on the association of GFP-NtADF 1 (S 6 A) with actin cables in pollen tubes. Together, these observations suggest that NtRac 1 -activated activity regulates the actin binding and depolymerizing activity of NtADF 1, probably via phosphorylation at Ser- 6. This notion is further supported by the observation that overexpressing a constitutively active NtRac 1 in transformed pollen grains significantly increases the ratio of phosphorylated to nonphosphorylated ADFs. Together, the observations reported here strongly support the idea that NtRac 1 modulates NtADF 1 activity through phosphorylation at Ser- 6 to regulate actin dynamics...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} design, modeling, fabrication, {{and testing}} of different Lab-on-chip (LOC) devices to study static and dynamic behavior of pollen tubes in bio-mechanical-chemical environments. The main components of microfluidic platform include microfluidic network for manipulation, trapping and growing {{of a series of}} pollen tubes in a controlled environment, actuating channels in order to introduce chemicals and drugs toward the pollen tube, microstructural elements such as microgaps and microcantilevers to provide Ex-Vivo environment for characterizing static and dynamic responses of pollen tubes. A Lab-On-Chip (LOC), called, TipChip was developed as a flexible platform that can simplify sophisticated functions such as chemical reactions, drug development, by integrating them within a single micro-device. The configuration of the microfluidic network was developed {{in such a way that}} it allows observation under chemical or mechanical manipulation of multiple pollen tubes. The growth of pollen tubes under different flow rates and geometrical dimensions of microfluidic network has been studied and the challenges have been identified. The microfluidic platform design was enhanced to deal with the challenges by adapting the dimensions of the microfluidic network and the inlet flow. It provides identical growth environments for growing pollen tubes along each microchannel and improves the performance of microfluidic device, through varying the dimensions and geometries of the microfluidic network. The thesis identifies the static response of pollen tube to chemical stimulation which was used to determine the role of a few of the growth regulators such as sucrose and calcium ions as they regulate tube turgor pressure and cell wall mechanical properties of pollen tube. New experimental platforms were fabricated to treat locally the pollen tube at the tip in order to characterize its static response to local treatment in reorienting the growth direction. The device is also used to locally stimulate the cylindrical region of pollen tube. Using these LOC devices we attempted to answer some questions regarding the role of <b>regulators</b> in pollen <b>tube</b> growth. The thesis explores in detail the dynamic growth of pollen tube in normal condition and also under chemical stimulation. Waveform analysis is employed in order to extract primary and secondary oscillation frequencies of pollen tube as significant indicators of dynamic growth of pollen tube. The dynamic response of pollen tubes is implemented as a whole-plant cell sensor for toxicity detection in order to detect toxic materials in concentration-based manner. Aluminum ions were tested as the toxic substance. The degree of toxicity was defined by measuring the reduction in growth rate as well as peak oscillation frequencies in the case of static and dynamic response of pollen tube, respectively. The thesis addresses the quantification of mechanical properties of pollen tube cell wall using the Bending LOC (BLOC) platform. The flexural rigidity of the pollen tube and the Young’s modulus of the cell wall are estimated through finite element modeling of the observed fluid-structure interaction. The thesis also explores the feasibility of studying the pollen tube response to the mechanical stimulation. The microfluidic device also enables integrating mechanical force obstructing pollen tube growth in order to characterize the interaction of pollen tube and mechanical structures which are similar to the in-vivo interaction between a pollen tube and the growth matrix during the course of growth toward the ovule. The behavior of the pollen tube while passing through microgap was also explored in detail. The deflection of microgap under growth force and the changes in diameter of the pollen tube under reaction force from microgap were evaluated. This part explores the role of mechanical forces in bursting the pollen tube tip which could explain the contribution of mechanical signal in the bursting of tube near the vicinity of the ovule. In addition, the configuration of microgap enabled the estimation of the maximum invasive force exerted by pollen tube. Thus, the proposed microfluidic platform is highly suitable for cellular analysis, pollen tube biology and detection of toxicity. ...|$|R
