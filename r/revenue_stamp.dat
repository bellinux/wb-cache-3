This situation, together with the increasing cost of the retirement plans and the delay in its payments, were the causes of the financial and institutional crisis of 1998, which ended in the closure of the university in the second semester of 1998 and the suspension of payment to all the academic and administrative staff members.|$|E
5|$|The {{currencies}} of Puerto Rico closely {{follow the}} historic development of Puerto Rico. As {{a colony of}} Spain and the United States, Puerto Rico was granted the use of both foreign and provincial currencies. Following the Spanish colonization in 1502, Puerto Rico became an important port, with its own supply of gold. However, as the mineral reserves ran empty within the century, the archipelago's economy suffered. The Spanish Crown issued the Situado Mexicano, which meant that a semi-regular shipment of gold from the Viceroyalty of New Spain {{would be sent to}} the island, as a way to provide economic support. Between 1636 and 1637, Philip IV of Spain imposed a tax which had to be paid using a <b>revenue</b> <b>stamp.</b> Inspired by this, Puerto Rico began producing banknotes in 1766, becoming the first colony to print 8-real banknotes in the Spanish Empire and which in the Spanish government's approval of subsequent issues.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>revenue</b> <b>stamps</b> in the United States {{were used}} briefly during colonial times, {{among the most}} notable usage {{involved}} the Stamp Act. Long after independence, the first <b>revenue</b> <b>stamps</b> printed by the United States government were issued {{in the midst of}} the American Civil War, prompted by the urgent need to raise revenue to pay for the great costs it incurred. After the war ended however, <b>revenue</b> <b>stamps</b> and the taxes they represented still continued. <b>Revenue</b> <b>stamps</b> served to pay tax duties on items that came under two main categories, Proprietary and Documentary. Proprietary stamps paid tax duties on goods like alcohol and tobacco, and were also used for various services, while Documentary stamps paid duties on legal documents, mortgage deeds, stocks and a fair number of other legal dealings. Proprietary and Documentary stamps often bore these respective designations, while in several of the issues they shared the same designs, sometimes with minor variations. Beginning in 1862 the first <b>revenue</b> <b>stamps</b> were issued, and would continue to be used for another hundred years and more.

60|$|The tax {{collected}} from the people has been reduced more than $80,000,000 per annum. By steadiness in our present course {{there is no reason}} why in a few short years the national tax gatherer may not disappear from the door of the citizen almost entirely. With the <b>revenue</b> <b>stamp</b> dispensed by postmasters in every community, a tax upon liquors of all sorts and tobacco in all its forms, and by a wise adjustment of the tariff, which will put a duty only upon those articles which we could dispense with, known as luxuries, and on those which we use more of than we produce, revenue enough may be raised after a few years of peace and consequent reduction of indebtedness to fulfill all our obligations. A further reduction of expenses, in addition to a reduction of interest account, may be relied on to make this practicable. Revenue reform, if it means this, has my hearty support. If it implies a collection of all the revenue for the support of the Government, for the payment of principal and interest of the public debt, pensions, etc., by directly taxing the people, then I am against revenue reform, and confidently believe the people are with me. If it means failure to provide the necessary means to defray all the expenses of Government, and thereby repudiation of the public debt and pensions, then I am still more opposed to such kind of revenue reform. Revenue reform has not been defined by any of its advocates to my knowledge, but seems to be accepted as something which is to supply every man's wants without any cost or effort on his part.|$|E
