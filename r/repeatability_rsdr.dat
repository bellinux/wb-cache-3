40|$|A {{collaborative}} study, International Evaluation Measurement Programme®- 25 a, {{was conducted}} in accordance with international protocols to determine the performance characteristics of an analytical method for the determination of dissolved bromate in drinking water. The method should fulfill the analytical requirements of Council Directive 98 / 83 /EC (referred to in this work as the Drinking Water Directive; DWD). The new draft standard method under investigation is based on ion chromatography followed by post-column reaction and UV detection. The collaborating laboratories used the Draft International Organization for Standardization (ISO) /Draft International Standard (DIS) 11206 document. The existing standard method (ISO 15061 : 2001) is based on ion chromatography using suppressed conductivity detection, in which a preconcentration step may be required for the determination of bromate concentrations as low as 3 to 5 μg/L. The new method includes a dilution step that reduces the matrix effects, thus allowing the determination of bromate concentrations down to 0. 5 μg/L. Furthermore, the method aims to minimize any potential interference of chlorite ions. The collaborative study investigated different types of drinking water, such as soft, hard, and mineral water. Other types of water, such as raw water (untreated), swimming pool water, a blank (named river water), and a bromate standard solution, were included as test samples. All test matrixes except the swimming pool water were spiked with high-purity potassium bromate to obtain bromate concentrations ranging from 1. 67 to 10. 0 μg/L. Swimming pool water was not spiked, as this water was incurred with bromate. Test samples were dispatched to 17 laboratories from nine different countries. Sixteen participants reported results. The <b>repeatability</b> RSD (<b>RSDr)</b> ranged from 1. 2 to 4. 1 %, while the reproducibility RSD (RSDR) ranged from 2. 3 to 5. 9 %. These precision characteristics compare favorably with those of ISO 15601. A thorough comparison of the performance characteristics is presented in this report. All method performance characteristics obtained {{in the frame of}} this ollaborative study indicate that the draft ISO/DIS 11206 standard method meets the requirements set down by the DWD. It can, therefore, be considered to fit its intended analytical purpose. JRC. D. 6 -Food Safety and Qualit...|$|R

In the present study, 19 methods for (GM) soy, maize canola and potato were validated in-house of which 14 {{on the basis of a}}n 8 -day validation scheme using eight different samples and five on the basis of a more concise validation protocol. In this way, data was obtained with respect to the detection limit, accuracy and precision. Also, decision limits were calculated for declaring non-conformance (> 0. 9 %) with 95 % reliability. In order to estimate the contribution of the different steps in the GMO analysis to the total variation variance components were estimated using REML (residual maximum likelihood method). From these components, relative standard deviations for <b>repeatability</b> and reproducibility (<b>RSDr</b> and RSDR) were calculated. The results showed that not only the PCR reaction but also the factors ‘DNA isolation’ and ‘PCR day’ are important factors for the total variance and should therefore be included in the in-house validation.

40|$|An LC-MS/MS based {{method of}} {{analysis}} to determine the four Fusarium toxins deoxynivalenol, HT- 2 toxin, T- 2 toxin, and zearalenone in cereals and cereal-based compound animal feed has been validated through a collaborative study. After extraction of the mycotoxins with ethyl acetate / water, and addition of sodium sulphate an aliquot of the organic phase was spiked with stable-isotope labelled isotopologues of the targeted analytes and dried down. The dry extract was then reconstituted with mobile phase and injected into a LC-MS. The described use of the isotopologues keeps costs down while still offering many of their benefits. This is evidenced by relative <b>repeatability</b> standard deviations (<b>RSDr)</b> between 5 and 15 %. Exceptions were T- 2 toxin at 7 μg/kg with 27 %, and at 3. 5 μg/kg with 35 %, and zearalenone at 3. 4 μg/kg with 32 % RSDr. The tested contamination ranges were 88 to 559 μg/kg for deoxynivalenol, 22 to 178 μg/kg for HT- 2 toxin, 3. 5 to 50 μg/kg for T- 2 toxin, and 3. 4 to 430 μg/kg for zearalenone. For 10 of the 20 analyte / matrix combinations (four analytes in five matrices) Horwitz ratios between 0. 6 and 0. 9 were computed, for another six the ratios were below 1. 5. The remaining four test samples were associated with Horwitz ratios between 2. 0 and 4. 4. They were the samples described above, two containing T- 2 toxin and one zearalenone, plus one complex matrix sample containing zearalenone at a low contamination level. For this complex matrix sample {{we were able to}} show the importance of proper separation in LC-MS. Because of the use of test materials having assigned reference values in this study trueness could be assessed. The observed biases were small and only significant for deoxynivalenol (- 8 %) and HT- 2 toxin (- 11 %). For T- 2 toxin and zearalenone they were insignificant. To facilitate the checking of compliance of a test result produced with this method with legislation a description on how to estimate measurement uncertainty based on these results is provided. All of the above shows that the studied method is fit for the purpose of enforcing existing and anticipated legislative limits of the four Fusarium toxins deoxynivalenol, HT- 2 toxin, T- 2 toxin, and zearalenone in unprocessed cereals and cereal-based compound animal feed.

40|$|An {{interlaboratory study}} was {{performed}} in eight laboratories to validate a liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for the simultaneous determination of aflatoxins and sterigmatocystin (STC) in white rice and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor). Fortified samples (at three different levels) of white rice and sorghum were extracted, purified through a solid-phase extraction (SPE) column, and then analyzed by LC/MS/MS. The apparent recoveries (ARs) ranged from 78. 8 % to 95. 0 % for aflatoxins and from 85. 3 % to 96. 7 % for STC. The relative standard deviations for <b>repeatability</b> (<b>RSDr)</b> and reproducibility (RSDR) of aflatoxins were in the ranges 7. 9 %– 33. 8 % and 24. 4 %– 81. 0 %, respectively. For STC, the RSDr ranged from 7. 1 % to 40. 2 % and the RSDR ranged from 28. 1 % to 99. 2 %. The Horwitz ratio values for the aflatoxins and STC ranged from 0. 4 to 1. 2 in white rice and from 0. 3 to 1. 0 in sorghum, respectively. These results validated this method for the simultaneous determination of aflatoxins and STC by LC/MS/MS after SPE column cleanup. The percentages of satisfactory Z-score values (|Z| ≤ 2) were the following: for white rice, 100 % for aflatoxins and STC; for sorghum, 100 %, except in data from two laboratories for STC (0. 3 μg/kg). This validated that the LC/MS/MS method was successfully applied for the determination of aflatoxins and STC in 20 white rice and 20 sorghum samples sourced from Korean markets...|$|E
40|$|An inter-laboratory {{validation}} study according to harmonized protocols, {{was carried out}} {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for the determination of semicarbazide (SEM) in fresh whole egg and in a industrially processed whole egg powder. An aliquot of the sample was extracted with hydrochloric acid and derivatized with 2 -nitrobenzaldehyde, using 1, 2 -[15 N 2, 13 C] SEM as internal standard. The extract was neutralized and purified on a solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. SEM was determined by reverse phase LC with detection by MS/MS. Five fresh egg samples, three of them obtained from nitrofurazone incurred hens, one spiked with 50 µg•kg- 1 SEM and a blank sample, and five industrial whole egg powder samples, three of them spiked with fresh whole egg from incurred hens, one sample spiked with 350 µg•kg- 1 SEM and one blank sample, were sent to 15 laboratories from 10 different European countries from which results were obtained from 12 participants. Recoveries for the fresh egg and the egg powder were 105. 3 % and 121. 3 %, respectively. The relative standard deviation for <b>repeatability</b> (<b>RSDr)</b> ranged from 2. 9 % to 9. 3 % and the relative standard deviation for reproducibility (RSDR) ranged from 21. 0 % to 38. 1 %. The method showed acceptable within-laboratory and between laboratory precision for all two matrices, as evidenced by HORRAT values, at the target levels of determination for SEM. JRC.

40|$|Alternaria {{species are}} capable of {{producing}} several secondary toxic metabolites in infected plants and in agricultural commodities, which play important roles in food safety. Alternaria alternata {{turn out to be}} the most frequent fungal species invading tomatoes. Alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), and tentoxin (TEN) are some of the main Alternaria mycotoxins that can be found as contaminants in food. In this work, an analytical method based on liquid chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) detection for the simultaneous quantification of AOH, AME, and TEN in tomato and tomato-based products was developed. Mycotoxin analysis was performed by dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) combined with LC-ESI-MS/MS. Careful optimization of the MS/MS parameters was performed with an LC/MS system with the ESI interface in the positive ion mode. Mycotoxins were efficiently extracted from sample extract into a droplet of chloroform (100 µL) by DLLME technique using acetonitrile as a disperser solvent. Method validation following the Commission Decision No. 2002 / 657 /EC was carried out by using tomato juice as a blank matrix. Limits of detection and quantitation were, respectively, in the range 0. 7 and 3. 5 ng/g. Recovery rates were above 80 %. Relative standard deviations of <b>repeatability</b> (<b>RSDr)</b> and intermediate reproducibility (RSDR) were ≤ 9 % and ≤ 15 %, respectively, at levels of 25 and 50 ng/g.

40|$|The {{performance}} {{characteristics of a}} method for {{the determination of the}} marker substance glycerol triheptanoate (GTH) in processed animal by-products (ABPs) based on gas chromatography (GC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS) were determined via a collaborative study. Within the European Union GTH needs {{to be added to the}} portion of processed ABPs that must not enter the feed and food chain (Categories 1 and 2) at a minimum concentration of 250 mg kg- 1 related to the fat fraction of the test samples analysed. The test materials included in the validation study consisted of three meat and bone meal (MBM) and three fat samples that contained GTH at different concentrations ranging from 61 to 455 mg kg- 1. The obtained relative standard deviation of <b>repeatability</b> (<b>RSDr)</b> varied from 3. 4 to 7. 8 % and the relative standard deviation of reproducibility (RSDR) varied from 9. 0 to 16. 5 %, corresponding to HORRAT values that were in all cases equal or below the critical value of 2. 0. The estimated trueness expressed in terms of average concentration obtained in the study compared to the target concentrations of GTH in all test materials varied from 95 to 107 % confirming acceptable values for the trueness of the method. Based on the acceptable values for the precision and trueness the method is fit for the intended purpose and can be used for official control purposes to determine GTH in processed animal by-products from Category 1 and Category 2.

40|$|A liquid chromatographic {{method for}} the {{determination}} of fumonisins B- 1 (FB 1) and B- 2 (FB 2) in corn-based foods for infants and young children was subjected to an interlaboratory validation study involving 11 laboratories. Five blind duplicate sample pairs of each matrix were analyzed to establish the accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility of the method. Mass fractions in the baby food samples ranged from 89. 1 to 384. 4 mu g/kg FB 1 and from 22. 5 to 73. 6 mu g/kg FB 2. The method involved a warm extraction with citrate phosphate buffer-methanol-acetonitrile (50 + 25 + 25, v/v/v), a cleanup through an immunoaffinity column, and an end-determination of fumonisins by LC after automated precolumn derivatization with o-phthaldialdehyde reagent. RSDs for within-laboratory <b>repeatability</b> (<b>RSDr)</b> ranged from 6. 8 to 23. 5 % for FB 1 and 7. 6 to 22. 9 % for FB 2. RSDs for between-laboratory reproducibility (RSDR) ranged from 15. 4 to 26. 2 % for FB 1 and 21. 6 to 36. 3 % for FB 2. Mean FB 1 recoveries from baby foods spiked at 100. 0 and 250. 0 mu g/kg were 89 and 96 %, respectively; for FB 2 spiked foods at 25. 0 and 62. 5 mu g/kg recoveries were 90 and 85 %, respectively. HorRat values ranged from 0. 8 to 1. 2 for FB 1, whereas for FB 2 they ranged from 0. 9 to 1. 4 when calculated according to Horwitz, and from 1. 0 to 1. 7 when calculated according to Thompson, indicating an acceptable among-laboratory precision for all matrixes (HorRat value...|$|E
40|$|A novel liquid {{chromatography}} single quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC¿MS) method for {{the determination of}} the feed additive semduramicin, in poultry feed, was developed and single-laboratory validated. This work was selected as a real case scenario to outline the different steps that may be needed whenever the standardisation of an analytical method in the field of methods of analysis for animal feedingstuffs is attempted. In this manuscript the main achievements reached within the development and the singlelaboratory validation of an analytical method for the determination of semduramicin in feedingstuffs are detailed. Semduramicin is extracted from the feedingstuffs with acetonitrile. The obtained extracts are then filtered and diluted appropriately. The separation has been carried out in a reverse phase C 18 column using isocratic elution with a mixture of methanol and 20 mM ammonium formate solution as mobile phase. The ammonium adducts have been selected for monitoring the coccidiostats signals in the mass spectrometry detector. The method has been successfully validated for the determination of semduramicin concentrations ranging between half of the minimum authorized concentration (10 mgkg- 1) to twice of the maximum authorized concentration (50 mgkg- 1). Agood relative standard deviation for <b>repeatability</b> (<b>RSDr)</b> varying from 2. 8 to 3. 2 % has been obtained whereas the relative standard deviation for intermediate precision (RSDInt.) ranged from 3. 7 to 7. 3 %. The obtained analytical performance characteristics of the method demonstrated its fitness for the purpose, making thus the proposed method suitable to be submitted for the last phase within the standardisation procedure, i. e. the inter-laboratory study.

The aim was to extend the scope of a method already standardised for {{the determination of}} acrylamide in bakery and potato products to include roasted coffee. Modifications of the already standardised method were therefore kept to a minimum. The method was based on aqueous extraction of the roasted coffee matrix and solid phase extraction (SPE) clean-up followed by isotope dilution high performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS). The test portion {{of the sample was}} spiked with stable isotope labelled acrylamide and extracted on a mechanical shaker with n-hexane and water for one hour. The sample extract was centrifuged, the organic phase was discarded, and a portion of the aqueous extract was further cleaned-up by solid phase extraction on an Isolute Multimode cartridge followed by a second clean-up step on an Isolute ENV+ cartridge. The volume of the acrylamide-containing fraction eluted from the second SPE column was reduced by evaporation and analysed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with tandem mass spectrometric detection. Three coffee samples and one aqueous acrylamide standard solution were sent to 11 laboratories from 8 EU Member States. All samples were sent as blinded duplicates. Based on the reported results the relative standard deviations for reproducibility (RSDR) were 11. 5 % at a level of 160 µg/kg, 10. 1 % at a level of 263 µg/kg, and 9. 6 % at a level of 585 µg/kg. The values for <b>repeatability</b> (<b>RSDr)</b> in those materials ranged from 1 % to 3. 5 %. The method performance parameters are satisfying with regard to internationally accepted criteria.

40|$|An inter-laboratory {{comparison}} {{was carried}} out {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a method based on immunoaffinity column clean-up followed by high performance liquid chromatography using fluorimetric detection (HPLC-FL). The method was tested for the determination of ochratoxin A (OTA) in animal feed at concentration levels relevant to those proposed according to Commission Recommendation 2006 / 576 /EC (). The test portion of the sample was extracted with methanol:water. The sample extract was filtered, diluted, passed over an immunoaffinity column for clean-up and then eluted with methanol. The separation and determination of the OTA was performed by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection with an excitation of 333 nm and emission of 467 nm. The animal feed samples, both spiked and naturally contaminated with OTA, were sent to 35 laboratories in 15 EU Member States, Colombia, Canada and Japan. Each laboratory received 6 duplicate samples ¿ 4 coded and 2 blanks for spiking with coded solutions. Blank marked test portions of the samples were spiked at levels of 76 µg/kg and 305 µg/kg OTA. The range of recovery values reported spanned from 47 % ¿ 124 % with an average value of 82 % and 79 % for each level respectively. Based on results for spiked samples (blind duplicates at two levels), as well as naturally contaminated samples (blind duplicates at three levels), the relative standard deviation for <b>repeatability</b> (<b>RSDr)</b> ranged from 3. 1 % ¿ 4. 7 %. The relative standard deviation for reproducibility (RSDR) ranged from 13. 5 % ¿ 14. 6 %.
