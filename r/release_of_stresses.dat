40|$|Stress relief {{techniques}} for measuring stresses {{have only been}} recently applied to concrete structures. The <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> due to either hole-drilling or slot-cutting are normally measured by surface strain gauging. A new technique is proposed in which an instrumented cylindrical inclusion is inserted inside a small hole in concrete to measure the stress relief due to overcoring. This thesis describes an experimental development of the proposed technique for in-situ stress measurement in concrete structures. The analysis, design and fabrication of the instrumented inclusion is described and a programme of calibration experiments is also described. Two types of instrumented inclusions of biaxial and triaxial configurations were used for bi-dimensional and tri-dimensional stress measurement respectively. Field trials using the inclusion technique were performed with limited success on three reinforced concrete bridges. Results of the field testing showed that the technique provides {{an extension of the}} existing stress relief methods for stress measurement by surface gauging. The potential use of the inclusion technique for in-situ stress measurement in existing structures is recognised but further refinement of the method and analysis is also recommended...|$|E
40|$|A brief {{review of}} recent results on {{particle}} emission from cold-rolled and annealed niobium with coarse surface finishes, and from monocrystalline niobium surfaces under 14. 1 -MeV neutron impact is given. For the cold-rolled and annealed samples two types of deposits were discovered on collector surfaces facing the irradiated targets. One type appeared as a fractional atom layer covering the surface, {{the other in the}} form of chunks. No chunk emission was observed for the monocrystalline niobium surface. The chunk deposits on the collectors facing the cold-rolled samples are not uniformly distributed over the collector area but are clustered along certain streaks or appear in patches. Furthermore, the number of chunks per unit collector area and the average chunk size were larger for the rough, cold-rolled samples than for the annealed samples. These observations suggest that the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> (e. g. stresses caused by cold-rolling) in the surface regions by the energy deposited by primary recoils, and surface roughness affect the chunk emission significantly.

50|$|In a non-phobic person, the arousal {{caused by}} the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> hormones results {{in a sense of}} curiosity, not a sense of emergency.

Upon arousal, the person's executive function is called upon not merely to assess the situation, but - if stress hormones are to be regulated - to prove no danger exists. If danger cannot be ruled out, executive function can no longer inhibit the urge to mobilize.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{diversity}} of deformations, esp. faults, in the Ordovician to the Devonian deposits of the Prague Basin, their relations to the Proterozoic basement, and draws some conclusions about causes of this diversity. Attention is paid to the eastern, deeper downfolded part of the Basin (Prague Synclinorium). Some longitudinal faults (Libeň Thrusts, Tetín Thrust) are confined to the basin filling and are apparently due to the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> generated during folding. Most of faults, however, {{are rooted in the}} Proterozoic basement and some of them were connected with Early Palaeozoic synsedimentary movements and/or volcanism (Prague Fault, Tachlovice Fault, Tobolka Fault, etc.). Some transverse faults separate segments having structures incompatible to one another. This testifies to the transverse faulting simultaneous with the folding and to the basement fractures influencing the deformation of the basin filling. The distinct SE vergency of folds in the Silurian-Devonian of the synclinorium {{can be explained by the}} underthrusting of a basement block towards NW. Otherwise, the tectonic transport in the synclinorium was bilateral and the vertical component of displacements prevailed. The general tectonic character of the Prague Synclinorium testifies to its fully autochthonous relation to the Proterozoic basement...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} laser {{ablation}} {{was used for}} the determination of residual stress of a formed plate. Manufacturing processes, like bending, create residual stresses in the product and those can be very disadvantageous for fatigue durability. Residual stresses that are generated during the manu-facturing of products can cause distortions, dimensional errors or can even break the products. The research material was ultra-high-strength steel (UHSS) with a yield strength of 1100 MPa. Speci-mens with a 90 degree bent angle were made by air bending using a press brake. Air bending causes variable residual stress patterns in the cross section of the material. The residual stresses of the formed area were determined by removing material and measuring strains caused by the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses.</b> A slot with the width of 1 mm has been manufactured parallel to the edge, both on the outer and on the inner side of the bend. True residual stress distribution can be calculated from the measured strains. A pumped 1064 nm Nd:YVO 4 ablation laser, whose pulse length is 90 ns, {{was used for the}} removal of material. This process creates a negligible heat affected zone (HAZ) and laser ablation doesn’t increase stresses in the specimen.

The characteristic non-linear price behavior of integrate-and-fire oscillators is supported by empirical data and has a behavioral origin called change-blindness. One advantage of the integrate-and-fire dynamics is that it enables a direct identification of cause and effect in price movements, without the need for statistical tests such as Granger causality tests, often used in the identification of causes of contagion. Our methodology can thereby identify the most relevant nodes with respect to onset of contagion in the network of stock exchanges, as well as identify potential periods of high vulnerability of the network. Over the time period of study, our method is able to identify the importance of the U. K. and U.

40|$|Numerous {{iron ore}} {{deposits}} are hosted within the Meso to Neo-Archean banded iron formations (BIFs) extending across the Singhbhum-Orissa Craton, eastern India. Despite the widespread distribution of BIFs, which forms {{part of the}} iron ore group (IOG), heterogeneity in their grade and mineral composition is occasionally observed even within a single ore deposit. Kiriburu-Meghahatuburu iron ore deposit (KMIOD), west Singhbhum district, Jharkhand, eastern India {{is characterized by a}} dominant hematite (often martitized) occurrence with a total resource of > 150 million tonnes (MT) at 62. 85 wt % Fe. Very high-grade blue dust ore (friable and powdery hematitewith~ 67 % Fe), high-grade massive, hard laminated hematitic ores (~ 66 % Fe) and medium to low grade goethitic/lateritic ores (50 %– 60 % Fe) are the common iron-ore lithologies in KMIOD. These ores can be distinguished in the field from their physical appearance, meso-scale texture and spatial occurrences with the host rocks along with the variation in chemical composition. The high-grade ores are characterized by high Fe (> 62 wt %), low Al 2 O 3 (1. 5 – 2. 5 wt %), low SiO 2 (2. 0 – 4. 5 wt %) and low P (< 0. 06 wt %). Detailed field studies and laboratory investigations on the ore mineral assemblages suggest that the mineralization of high-grade iron ores at KMIOD is controlled by three major parameters, i. e., lithological, paleoclimatic and structural controls. High-grade iron ores such as blue dust seem to be formed during leaching processes through inter-bedded ferruginous shale and banded hematite jasper (BHJ) occurring within BIFs. Structural elements such as folds, joint network, fracture arrays, local faults and steeply dipping bedding planes are surmised as strong controls for the evolution of different iron ore types from the BHJ. Most of the high-grade ores are concentrated at the hinge portions of second generation folds (F 2) owing to the easy access for circulation of meteoric solution along the fractures developed due to <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>stresses</b> at the hinge portions aided by supergene ore enrichment processes. The BHJ and interbedded ferruginous shale seem to have been given a significant contribution for the formation of different grades of iron ores over the area. Lithologically, the BIFs are governed by rheological features providing channel ways in the ore enrichment process. The variation in the iron ore mineralogy is caused by the variation in depositional and paleoclimatic environment, structural setting and lithological attributes. Hence, these parameters could be used for future exploration and grade recovery of iron ore resources in the region and in the adjoining areas...|$|E
