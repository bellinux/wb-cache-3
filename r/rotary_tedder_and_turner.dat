40|$|The Tracheary Element Differentiation-Related 6 (<b>TED</b> 6) <b>and</b> <b>TED</b> 7 {{membrane}} proteins {{function in}} the differentiation of xylem vessel elements, the cellular units for water conduction in angiosperm plants. Functional analysis of <b>TED</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>TED</b> 7 had suggested that these proteins directly bind to a subunit of the secondary cell wall (SCW) -related cellulose synthase complex, to promote SCW formation in xylem vessel elements. However, whether <b>TED</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>TED</b> 7 function in SCW formation of xylem vessel elements only, or function broadly in other cell types has remained unclear. To clarify this, we conducted detailed expression analysis of <b>TED</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>TED</b> 7 genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. This showed that <b>TED</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>TED</b> 7 are expressed in differentiating vessel elements of all organs examined here, including roots, leaves, and inflorescence stems. We detected no <b>TED</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>TED</b> 7 promoter activity in other types of cells with SCW thickening, such as fiber cells and anther endothecium, indicating that <b>TED</b> 6 <b>and</b> <b>TED</b> 7 have specific roles in SCW formation of vessel elements. Homology searches identified TED 6 / 7 -like proteins only in the angiosperm lineage. These data suggest that development of TED 6 / 7 proteins could have coincided {{with the emergence of}} the angiosperm lineage, <b>and</b> that <b>TED</b> 6 / 7 may have made key contributions to the evolution of water-conducting cells from tracheids to vessels...|$|R

40|$|Prawn {{trawling}} {{occurs in}} most states of Australia in tropical, subtropical, and temperate waters. Bycatch occurs to some degree in all Australian trawl fisheries, and there is pressure to reduce the levels of trawl fishery bycatch. This paper gives {{a brief overview of}} the bycatch issues and technological solutions that have been evaluated or adopted in Australian prawn-trawl fi sheries. Turtle excluder devices (<b>TED’s)</b> <b>and</b> bycatch reduction devices (BRD’s) are the principal solutions to bycatch in Australian prawn-trawl fisheries. This paper focuses on a major prawn-trawl fishery of northeastern Australia, and the results of commercial use of <b>TED’s</b> <b>and</b> BRD’s in the Queensland east coast trawl fishery are presented. New industry designs are described, and the status of <b>TED</b> <b>and</b> BRD adoption and regulation is summarized. The implementation of technological solutions to reduce fishery bycatch is assumed generally to assist prawn-trawl fisheries within Australia in achieving legislative requirements for minimal environmental impact and ecological sustainable development...|$|R

40|$|Xylem vessel {{elements}} are hollow cellular units that assemble end-to-end {{to form a}} continuous vessel throughout the plant body; the xylem vessel is strengthened by the xylem elements' reinforced secondary cell walls (SCWs). This work aims to unravel the contribution of unknown actors in xylem vessel differentiation using the model in vitro cell culture system of Zinnia elegans differentiating cell cultures and the model in vivo system of Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Tracheary Element Differentiation-Related 6 (<b>TED</b> 6) <b>and</b> <b>TED</b> 7 were selected based on an RNA interference (RNAi) screen in the Zinnia system. RNAi reduction of <b>TED</b> 6 <b>and</b> 7 delayed tracheary element (TE) differentiation <b>and</b> co-overexpression of <b>TED</b> 6 <b>and</b> 7 increased TE differentiation in cultured Zinnia cells. Arabidopsis <b>TED</b> 6 <b>and</b> 7 were expressed preferentially in differentiating vessel elements in seedlings. Aberrant SCW formation of root vessel elements was induced by transient RNAi of At <b>TED</b> 7 alone <b>and</b> enhanced by inhibition of both <b>TED</b> 6 <b>and</b> 7. Protein–protein interactions were demonstrated between <b>TED</b> 6 <b>and</b> a subunit of the SCW-related cellulose synthase complex. Our strategy has succeeded in finding two novel components in SCW formation and has {{opened the door for}} in-depth analysis of their molecular functions...|$|R

40|$|Dose {{delivery}} (total emitted dose, or TED) from {{dry powder}} inhalers (DPIs), pulmonary deposition, and the biological effects depend on drug formulation and device and patient characteristics. The {{aim of this}} study was to measure, in vitro, the relationship between parameters of inhalation profiles recorded from patients, the <b>TED</b> <b>and</b> fine particle mass (FPM) of Diskus and Turbuhaler inhalers. Inhalation profiles (IPs) of 25 patients, a representative sample of a wide range of 1500 IPs generated by 10 stable asthmatics, 3 x 16 (mild/moderate/severe) COPD patients and 15 hospitalized patients with an exacerbation asthma or COPD, were selected for each device. These 25 IPs were input IPs for the Electronic Lung (a computerdriven inhalation simulator) to determine particle size distribution from Ventolin Diskus and Inspyril Turbuhaler. The <b>TED</b> <b>and</b> FPM of Diskus and FPM of Turbuhaler were affected by the peak inspiratory flow (PIF) and not by slope of the pressure-time curve, inhaled volume and inhalation time. This flow-dependency was more marked at lower flows (PIF < 40 L/min). Both the <b>TED</b> <b>and</b> FPM of Diskus were significantly higher as compared to those of the Turbuhaler [mean (SD) TED(_diskus) (%label claim) 83. 5 (13. 9) vs. TED(_turbuhaler) (72. 5 (11. 1) (p = 0. 004), FPM(_diskus) (%label claim) 36. 8 (9. 8) vs FPM(_turbuhaler) (28. 7 (7. 7) (p < 0. 05) ]. The <b>TED</b> <b>and</b> FPM of Diskus and FPM of Turbuhaler were affected by PIF, the flow-dependency being greater at PIF values below 40 L/min. Lower PIFs occurred more often when using Turbuhaler than Diskus, since Turbuhaler have a higher resistivity, requires substantially higher pressure in order to generate the same flow as Diskus. <b>TED,</b> dose consistency <b>and</b> the FPM were higher for Diskus as compared to Turbuhaler. The flow dependency of <b>TED</b> <b>and</b> FPM was substantially influenced by inhalation profiles when not only profiles of the usual outpatient population were included but also the real outliers from exacerbated patients...|$|R
