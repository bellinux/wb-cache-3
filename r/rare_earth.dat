On the other hand, industrial process residues such as bauxite residue (red mud) and phosphogypsum contain low concentrations of <b>rare</b> <b>earths,</b> but are available in huge volumes [2]. Recovery of <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> from end-of-life consumer goods by urban mining and from industrial process residues by landfill mining can partly mitigate the supply risk of these critical metals. Efficient recovery of <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> from these resources is a technological challenge, even though many pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes have been described in the literature. At KU Leuven (Belgium), we are developing new breakthrough technologies for recovery and separation of <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> based {{on the use of}} ionic liquids. Ionic liquids are solvents that consist entirely of ions [3]. These solvents have properties that are quite different from those of conventional molecular organic solvents. Ionic liquids can find applications as lixiviants for selective leaching of <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> from solid materials, as organic phase in solvent extraction processes for separation of <b>rare</b> <b>earths,</b> and as electrolytes for the electrodeposition of <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> and alloys. During this talk, several new ionic liquid processes will be discussed: (1) recovery of yttrium and europium from end-of-life fluorescent lamps [4](2) recovery of <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> from neodymium-iron-boron magnets [5], (3) separation of <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> from transition metals by extraction with undiluted ionic liquids [6] (4) separation of <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> by homogeneous liquid-liquid extraction (HLLE) [7] (5) efficient recovery of scandium from leachates of bauxite residue [8].

Bringing together seemingly disconnected strands of scientific literature, this multidisciplinary approach allows to provide an overarching overview of the economics of <b>rare</b> <b>earths.</b> In terms of supply risk, as opposed to the common belief, it is not China’s dominant position per se, but its industrial policies which distort the <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> market.

Contrary to this, a potential supply shortage of <b>rare</b> <b>earths</b> would disrupt the further development of the automotive industry and its electrification.
