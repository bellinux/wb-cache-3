5|$|When the {{reaction}} of the regulator is tied to the behaviour, it is known as a <b>responsive</b> compliance model. The <b>responsive</b> compliance model was suggested by Ian Ayres and John Braithwaite in their book <b>Responsive</b> Regulation: Transcending the deregulation debate which built on earlier work by John Scholz.|$|E

5|$|Neurostimulation may {{be another}} option in {{those who are not}} {{candidates}} for surgery. Three types {{have been shown to be}} effective in those who do not respond to medications: vagus nerve stimulation, anterior thalamic stimulation, and closed-loop <b>responsive</b> stimulation.|$|E
5|$|As {{a service}} {{component}} of USSOCOM, MARSOC is tasked by the Commander USSOCOM to train, organize, equip, and deploy <b>responsive</b> U.S. Marine Corps {{special operations forces}} worldwide, in support of combatant commanders and other agencies. MARSOC has been directed to conduct foreign internal defense, direct action and special reconnaissance. MARSOC has also been directed to develop a capability in unconventional warfare, counter-terrorism, and information operations.|$|E
5|$|In May, Paul {{was one of}} 22 {{senators}} to sign a letter to President Donald Trump urging the President to have the United States withdraw from the Paris Agreement. According to the Center for <b>Responsive</b> Politics, Paul has received over $250,000 from oil, gas and coal interests since 2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} stages of {{end-of-life}} care, midazolam is routinely used at low doses via subcutaneous injection to help with agitation, myoclonus, restlessness or anxiety in the last hours or days of life. At higher doses during the last weeks of life, midazolam is considered a first line agent in palliative continuous deep sedation therapy when it is necessary to alleviate intolerable suffering not <b>responsive</b> to other treatments, but the need for this is rare.|$|E

The site was {{programmed}} to use HTML5 standards with a <b>responsive</b> design that adapts {{to the screen}} dimensions of laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This is partially to remove need for a separate mobile version. Their longform journalism was optimized for reading on tablets.|$|E
5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression is <b>responsive</b> to alprazolam. Clinical {{studies have shown}} that the effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved for the management of anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Anxious-ambivalent {{attachment}} is also misnamed as 'resistant attachment'. In general, a {{child with}} an anxious-ambivalent pattern of attachment will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the parent is present. When the mother departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when she returns. The anxious-ambivalent strategy {{is a response to}} unpredictably <b>responsive</b> caregiving, and the displays of anger (ambivalent resistant) or helplessness (ambivalent passive) towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.|$|E
5|$|Attachments between {{infants and}} {{caregivers}} form {{even if this}} caregiver is not sensitive and <b>responsive</b> in social interactions with them. This has important implications. Infants cannot exit unpredictable or insensitive caregiving relationships. Instead they must manage themselves {{as best they can}} within such relationships. Based on her established Strange Situation Protocol, research by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth in the 1960s and 1970s found that children will have different patterns of attachment depending primarily on how they experienced their early caregiving environment. Early patterns of attachment, in turn, shape — but do not determine — the individual's expectations in later relationships.|$|E
5|$|For anejaculation in SCI, the {{first-line}} {{method for}} sperm retrieval is penile vibratory stimulation (PVS). A high-speed vibrator {{is applied to}} the glans penis to trigger a reflex that causes ejaculation, usually within a few minutes. Reports of efficacy with PVS range from 15–88%, possibly due to differences in vibrator settings and experience of clinicians, as well as level and completeness of injury. Complete lesions strictly above Onuf's nucleus (S2–S4) are <b>responsive</b> to PVS in 98%, but complete lesions of the S2–S4 segments are not.|$|E
5|$|Friedrich Carl was an {{excellent}} sea boat; the ship was <b>responsive</b> to commands from the helm and had a moderate turning radius. She was somewhat unbalanced, however, and a 6degree rudder to port was required to keep the ship on a straight course. The ship's crew numbered 33 officers and 498 enlisted men, and while serving as a flagship, the crew was augmented with a command staff of 6 officers and 35 enlisted men. Friedrich Carl carried a number of smaller boats, including a large tender, two launches, a pinnace, two cutters, two yawls, and one dinghy.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element <b>responsive</b> to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E
5|$|In March 2000, the Schindlers filed {{a motion}} to permit {{assisted}} feeding of Terri, which is not considered a life-prolonging procedure under Florida law. Since clinical records indicated that Terri Schiavo was not <b>responsive</b> to swallowing tests and required a feeding tube, Judge Greer ruled {{that she was not}} capable of orally ingesting sufficient nutrition and hydration to sustain life, and denied the request. The Medical Examiner in his postmortem report was more definitive and reaffirmed that Schiavo could not have swallowed.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to addressing global challenges, the UN {{has sought to}} improve its accountability and democratic legitimacy by engaging more with civil society and fostering a global constituency. In an effort to enhance transparency, in 2016 the organization held its first public debate between candidates for Secretary-General. On January 1, 2017, Portuguese diplomat António Guterres, who previously served as UN High Commissioner for Refugees, became the ninth Secretary-General. Guterres has highlighted several key goals for his administration, including an emphasis on diplomacy for preventing conflicts, more effective peacekeeping efforts, and streamlining the organization to be more <b>responsive</b> and versatile to global needs.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to longitudinal studies, {{there has been}} psychophysiological research on the biology of attachment. Research has begun to include neural development, behaviour genetics and temperament concepts. Generally, temperament and attachment constitute separate developmental domains, but aspects of both contribute {{to a range of}} interpersonal and intrapersonal developmental outcomes. Some types of temperament may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and <b>responsive</b> caregivers it appears that some children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{versatile}} hunting dog, used {{for its ability}} to locate and retrieve game in harsh and adverse terrain and conditions. It is not specialised to any one type of terrain, and tends to score well in field trials. The Blue Picardy {{is considered to be a}} quiet breed, but requires a great deal of exercise as it has a high level of stamina. It loves to play, and is a <b>responsive</b> and obedient breed which thrives on human companionship. It is especially good with children.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{symptoms}} are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes, {{and are less}} <b>responsive</b> to medication. They commonly include flat expressions or little emotion, poverty of speech, inability to experience pleasure, lack of desire to form relationships, and lack of motivation. Negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life, functional ability, and the burden on others than positive symptoms do. People with greater negative symptoms often {{have a history of}} poor adjustment before the onset of illness, and response to medication is often limited.|$|E
5|$|Special Warfare Combatant-craft Crewmen (SWCC) {{operate and}} {{maintain}} state-of-the-art surface craft to conduct coastal patrol and interdiction and support special operations missions. Focusing on infiltration and exfiltration of SEALs and other SOF, SWCCs provide dedicated rapid mobility in shallow water areas where larger ships cannot operate. They also {{bring to the table}} a unique SOF capability: Maritime Combatant Craft Aerial Delivery System—the ability to deliver combat craft via parachute drop. Like SEALs, SWCCs must have excellent physical fitness, highly motivated, combat-focused and <b>responsive</b> in high stress situations.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} {{with a single}} rudder. The ships were described as good sea-boats, but were prone to heavy pitching. The ships were <b>responsive</b> and had a tight turning radius at low speed, but at hard rudder of 12degrees, the ships lost up to 70percent speed. The ships had a crew of 35officers and 708men normally, and when serving as a squadron flagship, they had an additional 13officers and 66men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats aboard, including two picket boats, two launches, a pinnace (later removed), two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian Legend {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from magazines such as Electronic Gaming Monthly and Nintendo Power. While {{it has been}} praised for its impressive graphics, memorable sound, and <b>responsive</b> controls, it {{has been criticized for}} its repetitive gameplay and complicated password system. It has since been considered a classic example of a multiple-genre game that set a standard for others such as the title Sigma Star Saga and incorporated gameplay elements from other titles such as The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, and 1942.|$|E
5|$|The State Stud of the Hungarian Royal and Imperial Court, Mezőhegyes, {{was founded}} in 1784 to help meet the demand for horses. At the time, Hungary was home to 1.5 million horses, with the Hungarian cavalry {{requiring}} between 10,000 and 15,000 new mounts per year. Different horses fulfilled different roles: courtiers and aristocrats wanted agile, <b>responsive,</b> impressive riding horses for their military endeavors, resilient mounts for hunting on horseback, and elegant carriage horses. Fulfilling these demands led Mezőhegyes to develop several different breeds and strains: the Arab-influenced Gidrán, half-bred Furioso-North Star, and the heavier Nonius.|$|E
5|$|The {{class had}} greatly {{improved}} handling characteristics over the preceding Nassau class. The Helgolands were much better sea boats {{and did not}} suffer from the severe rolling that the Nassaus did. The ships were <b>responsive</b> to the helm, and had a tight turning radius, and lost only minimal speed during swells. The ships lost up to 54% of their speed at hard rudder, and would heel up to 7°. For comparison, the earlier Nassaus lost up to 70% speed and held a 12° heel with the rudder hard over.|$|E
