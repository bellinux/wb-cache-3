40|$|The {{motivation}} {{to write about}} Self-Access Centres (SACs) comes from experiencing a marked difference in the frequency and depth of student participation at two separate centres; one in a university in Japan and one in a private language school in England. In this context ‘frequency’ means how often the students use the centre and ‘depth’ means in what ways {{and to what extent}} the equipment and resources are used. At the SAC in Japan, the facilities are continually exploited by a large number of students with many of them visiting {{three or four times a}} week, on an optional basis, for usually over an hour each time. The activities in which the students are engaged include listening to music while annotating lyrics, practising pronunciation in speaking booths, reading English language novels and graded-readers, and communicating in the target-language with other students and learning advisors. In contrast, the SAC at the institution in England is only frequented by a very small number of students and the activities are generally limited to the issuance and <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>books</b> and the use of computers for online social networking, which is usually conducted in the native languages of the students...|$|E
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The revised Vision 2025 {{document}} {{outlines the}} institutional structure, mandate revised {{in tune with}} changing scenario, current status of the marine fisheries in the country, institutional infrastructure, scientific and technical manpower, significant achievements {{in research and development}} carried out by the Institute during the past, SWOT analysis, issues and concerns facing the marine fisheries and mariculture sectors, identification and prioritization of research priorities and a road map for research for the period up to year 2025 under the various identified thematic areas and defining of outputs and outcome. The Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute (CMFRI) was established in 1947 to carry out multidisciplinary research in marine capture and culture fisheries and to develop the required human resource for research and development in the above areas through education and training. During the past 60 years, the Institute has grown in stature and size with 9 constituent research centres for addressing regional capture and culture fisheries research needs. The present sanctioned staff strength is Scientists 189 + 1, Technical 330, Administrative 152, Supporting 262 and Auxiliary 6. The X Plan budget is Rs. 2715 lakhs under Plan and Rs. 8810 lakhs under Non Plan. Recently developed infrastructure include two additional floors of laboratory and office space in the Headquarters, a modern multipurpose hatchery in the Mandapam Regional Centre, a lobster hatchery at Kovalam, Chennai, experimental marine aquarium at Calicut and Cochin, ornamental fish hatchery at Cochin, multipurpose research wet lab with running seawater at Visakhapatnam, new office cum laboratory building at Tuticorin, girls hostel at headquarters, a modern library with digital server, LAN, online access, computerized issue and <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>books</b> and a well developed ATIC (under NATP) at Cochin. The major achievements of CMFRI include development and implementation of a multistage stratified random sampling technique for assessing the marine fish landings, development of a strong information base on biology, systematics, population dynamics, fishery characteristics of all major stocks, stock assessment, fishing effort, yield, mortality, resource estimates of unexploited resources in the Andaman and Lakshadweep island ecosystems, biodiversity inventories on endangered and threatened species, database on fishery environmental characteristics, development of hatchery / grow out technologies for shrimp, swimming crab, mussels, oysters, pearl oysters, clams and seaweeds. Recently the Institute has developed {{for the first time in}} the world a tissue culture technology for marine pearls using Pinctada fucata and the earshell Haliotis varia. Another significant achievement was the world second development of the successful breeding technology for the sand lobster Thenus orientalis. The Institute also has developed pioneering breeding techniques for about a dozen species of marine ornamental fishes which are being commercialized. The technologies for sea cucumber and rock lobster breeding are nearing completion and would be ready for commercialization. A new initiative is the development of integrated sea farming of mussels and seaweeds in the coastal waters for additional income for farmers. The Institute has also ventured into the new and exciting area of open sea cage farming of finfish which is expected to open up a new avenue for marine fish farming in the country. The research works on biotechnology, fishery economics, livelihoods and transfer of technology are commendable. The institute also offers masters and doctoral degree courses in mariculture as part of the CIFE’s educational programme. The Perspective Plan presented in this document outlines the strategy for research by the Institute for the period up to year 2025 in the areas of marine capture fisheries and mariculture. In the face of the changing national and international marine capture fisheries and mariculture scenarios, the approach to resolve the researchable issues were categorized under three sections: basic research, strategic research and anticipatory research. Thematic areas and specific activities were identified in each of these areas and time frame outlined after prioritization. Under basic research, thematic areas outlined are mariculture technologies and marine resources. In these areas the specific programmes include biotechnology, biodiversity, fisheries environment. Under strategic research the thematic areas are marine resources, capture fisheries and mariculture. The specific activities are in fishery environment, modeling and management, assessment and monitoring, extension and economics, hatchery technology, biotechnology, growout, pearl production and mariculture systems. Under anticipatory research, the thematic areas are capture fisheries, mariculture, fisheries management and socioeconomics. The specific activities are conservation of fishery environment, trade and policy and biotechnology. This document projects altogether 68 specific research issues for the next 20 years, 7 in basic research, 49 in strategic research and 12 in anticipatory research. It is expected that by meticulously following the research agenda outlined in this Vision 2025 document, marine capture fisheries and mariculture scenario will contribute much better and proactively result in furthering the cause of overall marine fisheries development in the country.

40|$|What is the {{cross-sectional}} {{relationship between}} financial leverage and expected equity returns? How is the empirical relationship associated with firm 2 ̆ 7 s financial decisions? This dissertation investigates the potential {{explanations for the}} flatness relation between financial leverage and expected equity returns, and its link to firms capital structure determinants. Empirical evidence contradicts the theoretical prediction that leverage amplifies the equity risks. I decompose expected equity <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> <b>book</b> leverage portfolios according to their exposure to cash flow and discount rate risk. I find that low leverage firms have lower cash-flow beta and higher discount-rate beta than firms with high leverage. Although cash flow beta typically has a higher price <b>of</b> risk, <b>book</b> leverage portfolios load disproportionately on discount-rate beta, generating an essentially at relation. Moreover, the main determinants of firms capital structures are related to firms sensitivities to these systematic sources of risk and have different importance for low and high leverage firms. I show that temporary shocks are relatively more important for low leverage firms, and that financial distress risk seems to be captured by the sensitivity of firms 2 ̆ 7 cash flow innovations to market discount rate news. ...|$|R
