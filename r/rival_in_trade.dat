5000|$|From 1868, Laverton stood unsuccessfully for {{parliament}} in Westbury as a Liberal, first against the Conservative John Lewis Phipps, {{when he lost}} by only twenty-seven votes. Although Phipps was elected, the result was declared void {{as a result of}} an election petition brought by Laverton. Mr Justice Willes found that, although Phipps himself was personally innocent of any corrupt practice, his agent, Harrop, had carried out acts of intimidation on voters. The Judge found that Harrop, who was an agent of Phipps and a manufacturer in Westbury, [...] "had told his workmen that no man should remain in his employment who voted for the Petitioner, who was his <b>rival</b> <b>in</b> <b>trade,</b> and that these men or some of them were obliged to leave his employment in consequence of their refusing to abstain from so voting". A by-election was thus held in 1869, at which Laverton lost by only eleven votes, defeated by his rival's brother, Charles Paul Phipps, standing for the Conservatives. At the 1874 election he was finally elected as the borough's Member of Parliament, but he was defeated at the 1880 election by yet another Phipps, Charles Nicholas Paul Phipps.|$|E

Kinshasa lies on the southern bank of the Congo, directly across from Brazzaville. This {{is the only place}} in the world where two national capital cities are on opposite banks of a river, within sight of each other. Since the mid-19th century the two cities have been <b>rivals</b> <b>in</b> <b>trade,</b> sports and power.

50|$|Duala {{oral history}} adds further detail. Priso {{lived on the}} left bank of the Wouri {{in the town of}} Bonapriso. As the eldest son of Doo a Makongo (likely the King George in European records), Priso was the heir {{apparent}} to his father's position and wealth. However, he robbed and killed European merchants, so his father disowned him. His rapine grew so violent that his brother, Bele a Doo (Bell from the European records) fled to the opposite bank of the Wouri River, where he founded the Bonaberi township. Priso's father and/or brother collaborated with the Europeans, which allowed the merchants to capture Priso. One tale claims that after Priso had been caught, Bele populated Bonaberi with the captives Priso had taken. Another says that Priso and Bele fought at first but then teamed up against the Bakoko at Bonaberi. They then become <b>rivals</b> <b>in</b> <b>trade,</b> with Bele the eventual victor. Duala oral tradition holds that Priso died in Bimbia, possibly by violent means. A rival tradition places his death in Subu.|$|R

50|$|Walsh began {{publishing}} {{music in}} 1695, {{at which time}} he had few <b>rivals</b> <b>in</b> the <b>trade.</b> The firm established by John Playford in 1647 was in decline under his son Henry, and Thomas Cross was more involved with engraving than publishing.

In addition to English composers, he published {{a good deal of}} music by foreign composers, which he often copied from Dutch editions (Kidson et al. 2001a).|$|R

Even among those who talk the loudest against the rabble, there are many, I fear, who send them secret encouragement, and this not because they care aught for their grievances, but because the people are set against the Flemings, who are ill-liked by many of the merchants as being <b>rivals</b> <b>in</b> <b>trade,</b> and who have in their hands the greater portion of the dealings, both with Flanders and the Low Country; and indeed, though I see {{that in the long run}} we shall benefit greatly by this foreign trade, I quite perceive that the privileges that our king has given to the Flemings in order to win their good-will and assistance against France, do for the present cause disadvantage and harm to many of the traders of London." ...|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} blood libel cases brought the Jewish {{community}} of İzmir under harassment from the Greeks {{of the city}} at different times till 1921, who were also direct <b>rivals</b> <b>in</b> various <b>trades.</b> Although a rarity in Ottoman lands, repeatedly denounced by the sultans starting with Süleyman the Magnificent, the most serious of blood libel related troubles {{took place during the}} three months between April and June 1872, as reported by Henri Nahum. Although the official investigation had revealed the accusations as totally baseless in the specific case of the disappeared Greek child, later found dead by drowning with his skull fractured after his death and the Greek culprits also discovered in time, the quarter of Karataş was attacked on an almost daily basis during the three months and about sixty Jewish shops and houses were burnt in Karataş and Kemeraltı.|$|R

Afterwards, within a month indeed, the Apostles came to Tyre, and we attended their preaching--at first, because we were curious to learn the truth of this new faith against which my father railed, for, as you know, he is of the strictest sect of the Jews; and then, because our hearts were touched. So in the end we believed, and were baptised, both on one night, by the very hand of the brother of the Lord. The holy Apostles departed, blessing us before they went, and Demas, who would play no double part, told my father of what we had done. Oh! mother, it was awful to see. He raved, shouted and cursed us in his rage, blaspheming Him we worship. More, woe is me that I should have to tell it: When we refused to become apostates he denounced us to the priests, and the priests denounced us to the Romans, and we were seized and thrown into prison; but my husband's wealth, most of it except that which the priests and Romans stole, stayed with my father. For many months we were held in prison here in Cæsarea; then they took my husband to Berytus, to be trained as a gladiator, and murdered him. Here I have stayed since with this beloved servant, Nehushta, who also became a Christian and shared our fate, and now, by the decree of Agrippa, it is my turn and hers to die to-day." ...|$|R

50|$|Comacchio enjoyed {{prosperity}} {{under the}} Goths and the Lombards, {{and became the}} seat of a Lombard duchy.

When the Franks descended into northern Italy in 756, their king, Pepin the Short, included Comacchio in his famous donation of land to Pope Stephen II, a grant later confirmed by Pepin's son and successor, Charlemagne. In 854 Comacchio was sacked by their <b>rivals</b> <b>in</b> the salt <b>trade,</b> the Venetians, who laid it waste in 946.

60|$|The one undeniable {{good quality}} which raised Demoiselle Grifoni above all her <b>rivals</b> <b>in</b> the <b>trade</b> was her inexhaustible fortitude. She was never known to yield an inch under any {{pressure}} of adverse circumstances. Thus the memorable occasion {{of her life}} on which she was threatened with ruin was also the occasion on which she most triumphantly asserted the energy and decision of her character. At {{the height of the}} demoiselle's prosperity her skilled forewoman and cutter-out basely married and started in business as her rival. Such a calamity as this would have ruined an ordinary milliner; but the invincible Grifoni rose superior to it almost without an effort, and proved incontestably that it was impossible for hostile Fortune to catch her {{at the end of her}} resources. While the minor milliners were prophesying that she would shut up shop, she was quietly carrying on a private correspondence with an agent in Paris. Nobody knew what these letters were about until a few weeks had elapsed, and then circulars were received by all the ladies in Pisa, announcing that the best French forewoman who could be got for money was engaged to superintend the great Grifoni establishment. This master-stroke decided the victory. All the demoiselle's customers declined giving orders elsewhere until the forewoman from Paris had exhibited to the natives of Pisa the latest fashions from the metropolis of the world of dress.|$|R

6000|$|It was now Martin's turn to watch. The {{household}} cock {{had given}} his first summons, and the night was well-nigh spent. Upon examining {{the state of the}} furnace in which the wood was deposited in order to its being coked or charred, he {{was surprised to find that}} the fire had not been sufficiently maintained; for in his excursion and its consequences, George had forgot the principal object of his watch. Martin's first thought was to call up the slumberers; but observing that both his brothers slept unwontedly deep and heavily, he respected their repose, and set himself to supply the furnace with fuel without requiring their aid. What he heaped upon it was apparently damp and unfit for the purpose, for the fire seemed rather to decay than revive. Martin next went to collect some boughs from a stack which had been carefully cut and dried for this purpose; but, when he returned, he found the fire totally extinguished. This was a serious evil, and threatened them with loss of their trade for more than one day. The vexed and mortified watchman set about to strike a light in order to rekindle the fire but the tinder was moist, and his labour proved in this respect also ineffectual. He was now about to call up his brothers, for circumstances seemed to be pressing, when flashes of light glimmered not only through the window, but through every crevice of the rudely built hut, and summoned him to behold the same apparition which had before alarmed the successive watches of his brethren. His first idea was, that the Muhllerhaussers, their <b>rivals</b> <b>in</b> <b>trade,</b> and with whom they had had many quarrels, might have encroached upon their bounds for the purpose of pirating their wood; and he resolved to awake his brothers, and be revenged on them for their audacity. But a short reflection and observation on the gestures and manner of those who seemed to [...] "work in the fire," [...] induced him to dismiss this belief, and although rather sceptical in such matters, to conclude that what he saw was a supernatural phenomenon. [...] "But be they men or fiends," [...] said the undaunted forester, [...] "that busy themselves yonder with such fantastical rites and gestures, I will go and demand a light to rekindle our furnace." [...] He, relinquished at the same time the idea of awaking his brethren. There was a belief that such adventures as he was about to undertake were accessible only to one person at a time; he feared also that his brothers, in their scrupulous timidity, might interfere to prevent his pursuing the investigation he had resolved to commence; and, therefore, snatching his boar-spear from the wall, the undaunted Martin Waldeck set forth on the adventure alone.|$|R
