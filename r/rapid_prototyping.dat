40|$|The paper {{presents}} a theory for making <b>rapid</b> <b>prototypes</b> of jewelry from octree subdivision. Traditionally, {{the input of}} jewelry for making jewel <b>rapid</b> <b>prototypes</b> is the CAD models' representation. In this paper, a new representation for jewelry is introduced. Aesthetic jewelry is first bounded by a minimum bounding cube. The bounding cube is then subdivided into octrees. The cubes obtained are in three types: cubes fully filled the jewel model; cubes partially filled the jewel model and cubes out of the jewel model. Cubes out of the jewel model; are expelled, while cubes fully filled the jewel model are retained. For cubes partially filled in the jewel model, additional octree subdivision is performed. The number of octree subdivision levels depends upon the end-user requirement. After the octree subdivision process is completed, cubes partially filled the jewel model from different subdivision levels are replaced by boundary voxels. The final voxel model undergoes direct slicing to build the <b>rapid</b> <b>prototype.</b> Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

25|$|In 2005, Adrian Bowyer of the University of Bath {{started the}} RepRap Project {{to develop a}} <b>rapid</b> <b>prototyping</b> machine which {{would be able to}} {{manufacture}} some or most of its own components, making such machines cheap enough for people to buy and use in their homes. The project is releasing its designs and control programs under the GNU GPL. The RepRap approach uses fused deposition modeling to manufacture plastic components, possibly incorporating conductive pathways for circuitry. Other components, such as steel rods, nuts and bolts, motors and separate electronic components, would be supplied externally. In 2006 the project produced a basic functional prototype and in May 2008 the machine succeeded in producing all of the plastic parts required to make a 'child' machine.|$|E
25|$|The strict shape {{tolerance}} of gömböcs hindered production. The first prototype of a gömböc was manufactured in summer 2006 using three-dimensional <b>rapid</b> <b>prototyping</b> technology. Its accuracy however was below requirements, and the gömböc would often {{get stuck in}} an intermediate position rather than returning to the stable equilibrium. The technology was improved to increase the spatial accuracy to the required level and to use various construction materials. In particular, transparent (especially lightly colored) solids are visually appealing, as they demonstrate the homogeneous composition. Current materials for gömböcs include various metals and alloys, plastics such as Plexiglass, stones such as marble and ceramics, and injection-molded plastic. The balancing properties of a gömböc are affected by mechanical defects and dust both on its body and on the surface on which it rests. If damaged, the process of restoring the original shape {{is more complex than}} producing a new one. Although in theory the balancing properties should not depend on the material and object size, in practice, both larger and heavier gömböcs have better chances to return to equilibrium in case of defects.|$|E
500|$|Though FreeStyleGames {{experimented with}} other options {{including}} a controller-less game, camera and motion detection, and social-based games, but recognized quickly that the guitar controller {{was a key}} part of the series' success. The developers recognized they wanted to have a guitar controller that players would not be embarrassed to have in their living rooms and spent time getting the look of the controller accurate to a real guitar. The design of the game's guitar controller was overhauled, using <b>rapid</b> <b>prototyping</b> to test potential guitar designs. The final design of the controller for Live utilizes a new design with six buttons arranged into two rows of three frets, designated by black and white-colored notes in-game, instead of using the traditional row of five colored frets used by previous Guitar Hero games. Jackson explained that the new layout was meant to make the game easier for new players, as the three-button layout avoids the need to use one's pinkie finger, a difficulty they recognized new players had on the traditional five-button controller. The layout was also designed to provide a new challenge to experienced players, including more realistic simulations of chords. The choice to use only three buttons also came from statistical analysis of past games, where about 80% of the players would never play harder than the Medium difficulty level which typically only required the use of three fingers with the previous five-button controllers. The initial controller iterations, presented both in-studio and to Activision, were met with skepticism but they found that players quickly adapted to the new scheme as an improvement over the older controllers. The [...] "note highways" [...] for the songs were created by both programmers and musicians using MIDI software as to map to each of the six controller buttons and the open strum bar. Note highways were developed first for the Expert difficulty level, essentially recreating the guitar part of the song note for note, while highways for lower difficulty levels were then constructed by removing notes while assuring the core rhythm of the song remained.|$|E

40|$|Two {{major factors}} hampering the broad use of <b>rapid</b> <b>prototyped</b> {{biomaterials}} for tissue engineering applications are {{the requirement for}} custom-designed or expensive research-grade three-dimensional (3 D) printers and the limited selection of suitable thermoplastic biomaterials exhibiting physical characteristics desired for facile surgical handling and biological properties encouraging tissue integration. Properly designed thermoplastic biodegradable amphiphilic polymers can exhibit hydration-dependent hydrophilicity changes and stiffening behavior, which may be exploited to facilitate the surgical delivery/self-fixation of the scaffold within a physiological tissue environment. Compared to conventional hydrophobic polyesters, they also present sig-nificant advantages in blending with hydrophilic osteoconductive minerals with improved interfacial adhesion for bone tissue engineering applications. Here, we demonstrated the excellent blending of biodegradable, amphiphilic poly(D,L-lactic acid) -poly(ethylene glycol) -poly(D,L-lactic acid) (PLA-PEG-PLA) (PELA) tri-block co-polymer with hydroxyapatite (HA) and the fabrication of high-quality <b>rapid</b> <b>prototyped</b> 3 D macro-porous composite scaffolds using an unmodified consumer-grade 3 D printer.
