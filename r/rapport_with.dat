5|$|As senior officer, Lamason {{had access}} to the main camp and quickly built a <b>rapport</b> <b>with</b> the group.

Lamason also built a <b>rapport</b> <b>with</b> two other prisoners; French {{scientist}} Alfred Balachowsky and Dutch Olympian trainer Jan Robert. Both men had developed trustworthy contacts within the camp administrative area and were able to provide Lamason with reliable intelligence that assisted in the survival of the airmen.|$|E
5|$|His next {{assignment}} was in Yekaterinburg in the Urals, {{where he was}} appointed second in command of a training school for non-commissioned officers attached to the Anglo-Russian Brigade. He found this post frustrating, having to dismiss {{nearly a third of}} his initial cadre on medical grounds, and struggling to get supplies and support from the White Army authorities. Despite this, he developed a <b>rapport</b> <b>with</b> his men and an admiration for the Russian soldier.|$|E

The disease was wreaking havoc amidst the ethnic Bukusu population; threatening to decimate the ethnic group.

5|$|Detached with Nelson's expeditionary {{squadron}} for the expeditionary {{assault on}} Copenhagen on 2 April, Murray {{was given the}} task of leading the British force into the harbour, using channels he had helped to chart a decade earlier. She eventually passed by four Danish ships, taking fire from each one, before anchoring opposite the Jylland, which she engaged {{for the next four}} hours of the battle. By the time the truce was concluded, the Edgar had taken casualties of 31 killed and 104 wounded. During the peace negotiations with the Danish, and the subsequent foray to watch the Swedish forces at Karlskrona, Murray developed a strong <b>rapport</b> <b>with</b> Nelson, who had replaced Parker after the latter's recall to Britain.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} these {{developments}} to occur, Playford personally had {{to attend to}} the bureaucracy that stood in the way. He confronted public service workers, and successfully negotiated with the heads of private companies. But it was negotiations with the Federal Government that were to prove the hardest. In his time as Premier, Playford was to confront seven different Prime Ministers: Lyons, Page, Menzies, Fadden, Curtin, Forde and Chifley. Strangely, he enjoyed best relations with the Laborite Chifley, and had a poor <b>rapport</b> <b>with</b> his fellow conservative, Menzies. During the wartime years, Menzies' reluctance to meet with Playford initially hampered industrial efforts, but Playford's other federal colleagues made sure that deals could be made.|$|E
5|$|Cognizant of his {{increasing}} {{age and the}} wear catching places on one's body, the Phillies reduced Ruiz's workload during spring training, hoping to keep him fresh throughout the regular season. Regardless, he insisted upon catching pitchers' bullpen sessions so he could develop a feel and <b>rapport</b> <b>with</b> each pitcher. On July 25, Ruiz became the first catcher in the National League, and the second catcher in Major League Baseball history, to catch four no-hitters when teammate Cole Hamels no-hit the Chicago Cubs. Overall, Ruiz lost his starting job to Cameron Rupp, and had significant declines in many aspects of his game, particularly those at which he previously excelled, including framing pitches – in 2015, Baseball Prospectus ranked him worst in the league at doing so – and the mental aspect of the game, as he made several uncharacteristic errors.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{importance}} of his title, Thơ rarely appeared with Diệm in public and was a figurehead with little influence. The real power lay with Diệm's younger brothers, Nhu and Cẩn, who commanded private armies and secret police, as well as giving orders directly to ARVN generals. Nhu reportedly once ordered a bodyguard to slap Thơ because he felt Thơ had shown him a lack of respect. Diệm held Thơ in contempt and did not allow him {{to take part in}} major policy decisions, despite theoretically being the second most powerful man in the country.

5|$|During this period, Anne Boleyn {{played an}} {{important}} role in England's international position by solidifying an alliance with France. She established an excellent <b>rapport</b> <b>with</b> the French ambassador, Gilles de la Pommeraie. Anne and Henry attended a meeting with the French king at Calais in winter 1532, in which Henry hoped to enlist the support of Francis I of France for his intended marriage. On 1 September 1532, Henry granted her suo jure the Marquessate of Pembroke, an appropriate peerage for a future queen; as such she became a rich and important woman: the three dukes and two marquesses who existed in 1532 were the King's brother-in-law, the King's illegitimate son, and other descendants of royalty; she ranked above all other peeresses. The Pembroke lands and the title of Earl of Pembroke had been held by Henry's great-uncle, and Henry performed the investiture himself.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Cooper was loaned out to MGM for the Civil War drama film Operator 13 with Marion Davies, about a {{beautiful}} Union spy who {{falls in love}} with a Confederate soldier. Despite Richard Boleslawski's imaginative direction and George J. Folsey's lavish cinematography, the film did poorly at the box office. Back at Paramount, Cooper appeared in his first of seven films by director Henry Hathaway, Now and Forever, with Carole Lombard and Shirley Temple. In the film, he plays a confidence man who tries to sell his daughter to the relatives who raised her, but is eventually won over by the adorable girl. Impressed by Temple's intelligence and charm, Cooper developed a close <b>rapport</b> <b>with</b> her, both on and off screen. The film was a box-office success.|$|E

The village mayor is unwilling to give her money for a bus ticket to the city, so she resolves to earn the money herself, and recruits the remaining students to help. One girl suggests that they can make money by moving bricks in a nearby brickyard, and Wei begins giving the students mathematical exercises centered on finding out how much money they need to earn for the bus tickets, how many bricks they need to move, and how much time it will take. Through these exercises and working to earn money, her <b>rapport</b> <b>with</b> the class improves.

BSkyB {{chief executive}} Sam Chisholm attempted to make a joint offer with ITV which did not come into fruition, so he formed an alliance with the BBC, aware the corporation wanted a highlights package. Although Chisholm was against Parry's idea of a football-only channel, he built a <b>rapport</b> <b>with</b> the Premier League and his company invited Parry to its facilities in Livingston, where he spoke to Murdoch in person.|$|E

Savige continued to tour the front lines wearing his scarlet cap band and flying his car flag.

This chapter aims to hypothetically retrace Jacopo Pontormo's literary education: how he learnt to write and read and how he acquired his knowledge of Latin. Pontormo's basic education endowed him with the type of Florentine culture common for craftsmen. The chapter considers the books that the painter may have possessed, the libraries which he would have had access to and the circulation of books in early sixteenth-century Florence. Lastly, the chapter analyses Pontormo's interest, attested by his diary, in scientific works and in questions of natural philosophy...|$|R
5|$|After the {{acquisition}} of Jay Cutler, Hester took on the role as the de facto number one wide receiver. In {{the first game of}} the season, Hester caught seven passes from Cutler for 90 yards, including a 36-yard touchdown reception. In the following weeks Hester began to develop a <b>rapport</b> <b>with</b> Cutler and amassed 634 receiving yards and three touchdowns though the first ten weeks of the season. He played the best game of the season on October 25, 2009 against the Cincinnati Bengals, catching eight passes for 101 yards and a touchdown. In a game against the St. Louis Rams during the thirteenth week of the season, Hester injured his calf and missed three starts. Hester returned to play in the Bears season finale against the Detroit Lions, catching three passes for 75 yards. Despite missing the three starts, Hester led the team with 757 receiving yards, and finished behind Greg Olsen in receptions. Hester built his reputation around his kick returning abilities, but his kickoff-returning duties decreased significantly following the 2007 season finale. He told the Chicago Tribune that he plans on spending the offseason honing his receiving and returning skills by strengthening in his legs, especially to fully recover from the calf injury he sustained earlier.|$|E

After briefly partnering with Ken Briscoe (Chris Orbach), she becomes the {{permanent}} partner of John Munch (Richard Belzer) after his previous partner, Brian Cassidy (Dean Winters), leaves the unit.
