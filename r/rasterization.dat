25|$|When {{an outline}} font is used, a {{rasterizing}} routine (in the application software, operating system or printer) renders the character outlines, interpreting the vector instructions {{to decide which}} pixels should be black and which ones white. <b>Rasterization</b> is straightforward at high resolutions such as those used by laser printers and in high-end publishing systems. For computer screens, where each individual pixel {{can mean the difference}} between legible and illegible characters, some digital fonts use hinting algorithms to make readable bitmaps at small sizes.|$|E
25|$|Applications {{which use}} the Windows Presentation Foundation for the display {{elements}} can directly print to the XPS print path {{without the need}} for image or colorspace conversion. The XPS format used in the spool file, represents advanced graphics effects such as 3D images, glow effects, and gradients as Windows Presentation Foundation primitives, which are processed by the printer drivers without <b>rasterization,</b> preventing rendering artifacts and reducing computational load. When the legacy GDI Print Path is used, the XPS spool file is used for processing before it is converted to a GDI image to minimize the processing done at raster level.|$|E

However {{support for}} Direct3D 11.1 is limited as the update {{does not include}} DXGI/WDDM 1.2 from Windows 8, making unavailable many related [...] APIs and significant features such as stereoscopic frame buffer, feature level 11_1 and optional features for levels 10_0, 10_1 and 11_0.|$|E
2500|$|Prerendered (also {{known as}} closed) {{subtitles}} are separate video frames that are overlaid {{on the original}} video stream while playing. Prerendered subtitles are used on DVD and Blu-ray (though they are contained in the same file as the video stream). It is possible to turn them off or have multiple language subtitles and switch among them, but the player has to support such subtitles to display them. Also, subtitles are usually encoded as images with minimal bitrate and number of colors; they usually lack anti-aliased font <b>rasterization.</b> Also, changing such subtitles is hard, but special OCR software, such as SubRip exists to convert such subtitles to [...] "soft" [...] ones.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rasterization</b> is {{frequently}} faster than pixel-by-pixel rendering. First, {{large areas of}} the image may be empty of primitives; <b>rasterization</b> will ignore these areas, but pixel-by-pixel rendering must pass through them. Second, <b>rasterization</b> can improve cache coherency and reduce redundant work by taking advantage {{of the fact that the}} pixels occupied by a single primitive tend to be contiguous in the image. For these reasons, <b>rasterization</b> is usually the approach of choice when interactive rendering is required; however, the pixel-by-pixel approach can often produce higher-quality images and is more versatile because it does not depend on as many assumptions about the image as <b>rasterization.</b>|$|E
50|$|While {{the basic}} <b>rasterization</b> {{process has been}} known for decades, modern {{applications}} continue to make optimizations and additions to increase the range of possibilities for the <b>rasterization</b> rendering engine.|$|E
50|$|To {{prevent that}} the user sees the gradual <b>rasterization</b> of the primitives, double {{buffering}} takes place. The <b>rasterization</b> {{is carried out}} in a special memory area. Once the image has been completely rastered, it is copied to the visible area of the image memory.|$|E

50|$|The older form of <b>rasterization</b> is {{characterized}} by rendering an entire face (primitive) as a single color. Alternatively, <b>rasterization</b> {{can be done in}} a more complicated manner by first rendering the vertices of a face and then rendering the pixels of that face as a blending of the vertex colors. This version of <b>rasterization</b> has overtaken the old method as it allows the graphics to flow without complicated textures (a rasterized image when used face by face tends to have a very block-like effect if not covered in complex textures; the faces are not smooth because there is no gradual color change from one primitive to the next). This newer method of <b>rasterization</b> utilizes the graphics card's more taxing shading functions and still achieves better performance because the simpler textures stored in memory use less space. Sometimes designers will use one <b>rasterization</b> method on some faces and the other method on others based on the angle at which that face meets other joined faces, thus increasing speed and not hurting the overall effect.|$|E
