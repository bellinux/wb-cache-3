5|$|The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor <b>results</b> <b>show</b> <b>that</b> {{gamma rays}} and {{antimatter}} particles (positrons) {{can be generated}} in powerful thunderstorms. It is suggested that the antimatter positrons are formed in terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGF). TGFs are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning. The streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma rays. About 500 TGFs may occur every day worldwide, but mostly go undetected.|$|E
