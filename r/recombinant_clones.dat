50|$|Non-lytic insect cell {{expression}} {{is an alternative}} to the lytic baculovirus expression system. In non-lytic expression, vectors are transiently or stably transfected into the chromosomal DNA of insect cells for subsequent gene expression. This is followed by selection and screening of <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones.</b> The non-lytic system has been used to give higher protein yield and quicker expression of recombinant genes compared to baculovirus-infected cell expression. Cell lines used for this system include: Sf9, Sf21 from Spodoptera frugiperda cells, Hi-5 from Trichoplusia ni cells, and Schneider 2 cells and Schneider 3 cells from Drosophila melanogaster cells. With this system, cells do not lyse and several cultivation modes can be used. Additionally, protein production runs are reproducible. This system gives a homogeneous product. A drawback of this system is the requirement of an additional screening step for selecting viable clones.|$|E
50|$|It is {{commonly}} used in molecular biology as a reporter marker to monitor gene expression. It also exhibits a phenomenon called α-complementation which forms {{the basis for the}} blue/white screening of <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones.</b> This enzyme can be split in two peptides, LacZα and LacZΩ, neither of which is active by itself but when both are present together, spontaneously reassemble into a functional enzyme. This property is exploited in many cloning vectors where the presence of the lacZα gene in a plasmid can complement in trans another mutant gene encoding the LacZΩ in specific laboratory strains of E. coli. However, when DNA fragments are inserted in the vector, the production of LacZα is disrupted, the cells therefore show no β-galactosidase activity. The presence or absence of an active β-galactosidase may be detected by X-gal, which produces a characteristic blue dye when cleaved by β-galactosidase, thereby providing an easy means of distinguishing {{the presence or absence of}} cloned product in a plasmid. In studies of leukaemia chromosomal translocations, Dobson and colleagues used a fusion protein of LacZ in mice, exploiting β-galactosidase's tendency to oligomerise to suggest a potential role for oligomericity in MLL fusion protein function.|$|E

40|$|The {{envelope}} (env) glycoprotein {{of human}} immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) determines several viral properties (e. g., coreceptor usage, cell tropism, and cytopathicity) and is a major target of antiviral immune responses. Most investigations on env have been conducted on subtype-B viral strains, prevalent in North America and Europe. Our study aimed to analyze env genes of subtype-E viral strains, prevalent in Asia and Africa, with a nonhuman primate model for lentivirus infection and AIDS. To this end, we constructed a simian immunodeficiency virus/HIV- 1 subtype-E (SHIV) <b>recombinant</b> <b>clone</b> by replacing the env ectodomain of the SHIV- 33 clone with the env ectodomain from the subtype-E strain HIV- 1 CAR 402, which was isolated from an individual in the Central African Republic. Virus from this <b>recombinant</b> <b>clone,</b> designated SHIV-E-CAR, replicated efficiently in macaque peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Accordingly, juvenile macaques were inoculated with cell-free SHIV-E-CAR by the intravenous or intravaginal route; virus replicated in these animals but did not produce hematological abnormalities. In an attempt to elicit the pathogenic potential of the <b>recombinant</b> <b>clone,</b> we serially passaged this viral clone via transfusion of blood and bone marrow through juvenile macaques to produce SHIV-E-P 4 (fourth-passage virus). The serially passaged virus established productive infection and CD 4 + T-cell depletion in juvenile macaques inoculated by either the intravenous or the intravaginal route. Determination of the coreceptor usage of SHIV-E-CAR and serially passaged SHIV-E-P 4 indicated that both of these viruses utilized CXCR 4 as a coreceptor. In summary, the serially passaged SHIV subtype-E chimeric virus will be important for studies aimed at developing a nonhuman primate model for analyzing the functions of subtype-E env genes in viral transmission and pathogenesis and for vaccine challenge experiments with macaques immunized with HIV- 1 env antigens...|$|R

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for genome analysis of phytoplasmas, bacterial plant pathogens that cannot be cultivated in vitro in cell-free media. The procedure includes a CsCl-bisbenzimide gradient buoyant centrifugation followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -mediated whole genome amplification. The latter step involves digestion of the DNA by a restriction enzyme with an A/T-rich recognition sequence. Due to the different A/T content in the DNA of the pathogen and its plant host, the fragments originating from phytoplasma are shorter and are preferentially amplified in the PCR reaction. Products obtained were cloned and screened by dot-blot hybridization. Results showed that about 90 % of <b>recombinant</b> <b>clones</b> appeared to harbor phytoplasma specific DNA inserts. Sequencing of randomly selected clones was carried out and comparison with the NCBI database confirmed the bacterial origin for the sequences, which have been assigned a putative function.
