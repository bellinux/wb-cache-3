40|$|Carbonyl chlorofluoride (COCIF) is an {{important}} <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>chlorine</b> and Fluorine in the Earth's atmosphere. Satellite-based remote sensing measurements of COCIF, obtained by Received in revised form the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment (ACE) for a time period spanning February 2004 through April 2007, {{have been used in}} a global distribution study. There is a strong Accepted 18 February 2009 source region for COCIF in the tropical stratosphere near 27 km. A layer of enhanced COCIF spans the low- to mid-stratosphere over all latitudes, with volume mixing ratios of 40 - 100 parts Per trillion by volume, largest in the tropics and decreasing toward the poles. The COCIF volume mixing ratio profiles are nearly zonally symmetric, but they exhibit a small hemispheric asymmetry that likely arises from a hemispheric asymmetry in the parent molecule CCl 3 F. Comparisons are made with a set of in situ stratospheric measurements from the mid- 1980 s and with predictions from a 2 -D model...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{investigation}} of the photofragmentation of dihalomethanes CH 2 X 2 (X = F, Cl, Br, I) and chlorinated methanes (CHnCl 4 -n with n = 0 - 3) with VUV helium, neon, and argon discharge lamps is reported and the role played by the different halogen atoms is discussed. Halogenated methanes are a class of molecules used in several fields of chemistry and the study of their physical and chemical proprieties is of fundamental interest. In particular their photodissociation and photoionization are of great importance since the decomposition of these compounds in the atmosphere strongly affects the environment. The results of the present work show that the halogen-loss is the predominant fragmentation channel for these molecules in the VUV photon energy range and confirm their role as <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>chlorine,</b> bromine, and iodine atoms in the atmosphere. Moreover, the results highlight the peculiar feature of CH 2 F 2 as a source of both fluorine and hydrogen atoms and the characteristic formation of I- 2 (+) and CH 2 + ions from the photofragmentation of the CH 2 I 2 molecule...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{observations}} of stratospheric organic and inorganic chlorine {{were made in}} September 1993 out of Fort Sumner, New Mexico, using JPL balloon-borne MkIV interferometer.

Laboratory measurements of the reaction of ClO radicals on sulfuric acid solutions have indicated that, along with HCl, small amounts of perchloric acid, HClO 4, were formed. Very {{little is known about the}} fate of HClO 4 in the stratosphere and we use a photochemical box model to determine the impact of this new species on the partitioning of inorganic chlorine in the stratosphere. Assuming that HClO 4 is photochemically stable, it is shown that in the enhanced aerosol loading conditions resulting from Mt. Pinatubo's eruption, HClO 4 could represent a significant <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>chlorine</b> in the lower stratosphere, sequestering up to 0. 2 ppbv (or 50 %) of the total inorganic chlorine at 16 km.

Chemical production and loss of HOCl in the stratosphere is considered, along with photolysis of HOCl and prospects for HOCl as an inert chlorine reservoir.

40|$|The JPL MkIV interferometer, a Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) {{spectrometer}} {{designed specifically}} for atmospheric remote sensing, made measurements of {{the composition of the}} Arctic stratosphere in January, February and March 1992.

The data reveal that despite 5 to 6 km of subsidence inside the vortex, which more than doubled the vertically integrated column amounts (burdens) of HF and HNO 3 with respect to outside the vortex, considerable losses of NO 2, HCl and ClNO 3 were evident by mid-January. Temporary freeze-out of HNO 3 was observed only on one occasion, Jan. 19, and was accompanied by substantial reductions in HCl and ClNO 3.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{detection}} of hydrogen chlorine in a protostellar shock, by observing the fundamental transition at 626 GHz with the Herschel HIFI spectrometer. We detected {{two of the}} three hyperfine lines, from which we derived a line opacity 15 K and density > 3 x 10 (5) cm- 3 }. Combining with the Herschel HIFI CO(5 - 4) observations allows to further constrain the gas density and temperature, 10 (5) - 10 (6) cm- 3 and 120 - 250 K, as well as the HCl column density, 2 x 10 (13) cm- 2, and, finally, abundance: 3 - 6 x 10 (- 9). The estimated HCl abundance is consistent with that previously observed in low- and high- mass protostars. This puzzling result in the L 1157 -B 1 shock, where species from volatile and refractory grains components are enhanced, suggests either that HCl is not the main <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> <b>chlorine</b> in the gas phase, against previous chemical models predictions, or that the elemental chlorine abundance is low in L 1157 -B 1.

40|$|We report retrievals of COClF (carbonyl chlorofluoride) {{based on}} {{atmospheric}} chemistry experiment (ACE) solar occultation spectra recorded at tropical and mid-latitudes during 2004 - 2005. The COClF molecule {{is a temporary}} <b>reservoir</b> <b>of</b> both <b>chlorine</b> and fluorine {{and has not been}} measured previously by remote sensing. A maximum COClF mixing ratio of 99. 7 +/- 48. 0 pptv (10 (- 12) per unit volume, 1 sigma) is measured at 28 km for tropical and subtropical occultations (latitudes below 20 degrees in both hemispheres) with lower mixing ratios at both higher and lower altitudes. Northern hemisphere mid-latitude mixing ratios (30 - 50 degrees N) resulted in an average profile with a peak mixing ratio of 51. 7 +/- 132. 1 pptv, 1 sigma, at 27 km, also decreasing above and below that altitude. We compare the measured average profiles with the one reported set of in situ lower stratospheric mid-latitude measurements from 1986 and 1987, a previous two-dimensional (2 -D) model calculation for 1987 and 1993, and a 2 -D-model prediction for 2004. The measured average tropical profile is in close agreement with the model prediction; the northern mid-latitude profile is also consistent, although the peak in the measured profile occurs at a higher altitude (2. 5 - 4. 5 km offset) than in the model prediction. Seasonal average 2 -D-model predictions of the COClF stratospheric distribution for 2004 are also reported. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R

However, the majority of 3 antibiotics are excreted from animals in urine, feces, and manure. Consequently, the lagoons 4 used to store these wastes can act as <b>reservoirs</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria. 5 There is currently no regulation or control of these systems {{to prevent the spread}} of these 6 bacteria and their genes for antibiotic resistance into other environments.

40|$|Calculations {{of ozone}} {{depletion}} during the 1988 / 89 Arctic winter using a Lagrangian coupled photochemical-microphysical model are presented. Abundances of ClO {{in excess of}} 1 ppbv were observed {{at the end of}} the Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition on February 10, 1989. These are shown to be consistent with the removal of more than 90 percent of the reactive nitrogen and the conversion of more than 80 percent <b>of</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>chlorine</b> to active forms. This chemical state implies that ozone losses of more than 20 ppbv/day can be sustained in heavily denitrified air throughout much of February according to current photochemistry. As much as 74 percent of the loss is calculated to be due to ClO dimer photolysis. Following the warming of the vortex in mid-February 1989, ozone loss through ClO dimer photolysis becomes less effective as the rate of thermal decomposition of the ClO dimer increases. Thus, model results suggest that thermal decomposition of the dimer plays an important role in limiting ozone loss in the Arctic spring...|$|R
40|$|HCl and HF are {{expected}} to be the main <b>reservoirs</b> <b>of</b> fluorine and <b>chlorine</b> wherever hydrogen is predominantly molecular. They are found to be strongly depleted in dense molecular clouds, suggesting freeze-out onto grains in such cold environments. We can then expect that HCl and HF were also the major carriers of Cl and F in the gas and icy phases of the outer solar nebula, and were incorporated into comets. We aimed to measure the HCl and HF abundances in cometary ices as they can provide insights on the halogen chemistry in the early solar nebula. We searched for the J(1 - 0) lines of HCl and HF at 626 and 1232 GHz, respectively, using the HIFI instrument on board the Herschel Space Observatory.

40|$|Veterinary {{antibiotics}} {{are widely}} used at concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) to prevent disease and promote growth of livestock. However, the majority of antibiotics are excreted from animals in urine, feces, and manure. Consequently, the lagoons used to store these wastes can act as <b>reservoirs</b> <b>of</b> antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. There is currently no regulation or control of these systems {{to prevent the spread}} of these bacteria and their genes for antibiotic resistance into other environments. This study was conducted to determine the disinfection potential <b>of</b> <b>chlorine,</b> ultraviolet light and ozone against swine lagoon bacteria. Results indicate that a <b>chlorine</b> dose <b>of</b> 30 mg/L could achieve a 2. 2 - 3. 4 log bacteria reduction in lagoon samples. However, increasing the dose <b>of</b> <b>chlorine</b> did not significantly enhance the disinfection activity due to the presence of chlorine-resistant bacteria. The chlorine resistant bacteria were identified to be closely related to Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis. A significant percentage of lagoon bacteria were not susceptible to the four selected antibiotics: chlortetracycline, lincomycin, sulfamethazine and tetracycline (TET). However, the presence <b>of</b> both <b>chlorine</b> and TET could inactivate all bacteria in one lagoon sample. The disinfection potential of UV irradiation and ozone was also examined. Ultraviolet light was an effective bacterial disinfectant, but was unlikely to be economically viable due to its high energy requirements. At an ozone dose of 100 mg/L, the bacteria inactivation efficiency could reach 3. 3 - 3. 9 log. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
