40|$|Parametric kernel methods {{currently}} {{dominate the}} literature regarding {{the construction of}} animal home ranges (HRs) and utilization distributions (UDs). These methods frequently fail to capture the kinds of hard boundaries common to many natural systems. Recently a local convex hull (LoCoH) nonparametric kernel method, which generalizes the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method, was shown to be more appropriate than parametric kernel methods for constructing HRs and UDs, because {{of its ability to}} identify hard boundaries (e. g., rivers, cliff edges) and convergence to the true distribution as sample size increases. Here we extend the LoCoH in two ways: "fixed sphere-of-influence," or r-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a fixed radius <b>r</b> of each <b>reference</b> <b>point),</b> and an "adaptive sphere-of-influence," or a-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a radius a such that the distances of all points within the radius to the <b>reference</b> <b>point</b> sum to a value {{less than or equal to}} a), and compare them to the original "fixed-number-of-points," or k-LoCoH (all kernels constructed from k- 1 nearest neighbors of root points). We also compare these nonparametric LoCoH to parametric kernel methods using manufactured data and data collected from GPS collars on African buffalo in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results demonstrate that LoCoH methods are superior to parametric kernel methods in estimating areas used by animals, excluding unused areas (holes) and, generally, in constructing UDs and HRs arising from the movement of animals influenced by hard boundaries and irregular structures (e. g., rocky outcrops). We also demonstrate that a-LoCoH is generally superior to k- and r-LoCoH (with software for all three methods available at [URL]...|$|R
3000|$|In {{order to}} join a {{multicast}} group, the client becomes aware of the multicast address and port through the announcement phase and issues an unsolicited IGMP report. This report is forwarded by the SU to the BS, and from the BS to the closest multicast capable router which, in our scenario, is the ASN-GW. In order to optimize traffic delivery, the BS can [...] "snoop" [...] the IGMP report [30] {{and send it to}} the ASN-GW only. Once the latter receives the IGMP report, a new SIP Message request, called Join/Leave Request, is created and sent to the MBSC-SS. The message body of the Join/Leave request contains both user information and the IGMP report that has triggered it. The signaling server parses such an information and uses it to check whether the user is allowed to join the desired session. For example, the MBSC-SS can check on the MBSC-DB if the user has subscribed to that session. If the authorization check is successful, the MBSC-SS issues an MBS Context Request towards the ASN-GW in order to either trigger {{the creation of a new}} multicast context or reuse an already existing one for the new client. When the ASN-GW receives the MBS Context request, a message exchange between ASN-GW and BS is initiated through the <b>R</b> 6 <b>reference</b> <b>point.</b> If this signaling exchange is successful, it triggers a BS-initiated three-way Dynamic Service Addition handshake, carried out at MAC layer, between the BS and the SU of the client. Once the multicast context is created, the BS notifies the ASN-GW by sending it another R 6 message, called MBS Context Response. The ASN-GW, in turn, creates a SIP Message to notify the MBSC-SS that it can save the session information on the MBSC-DB.|$|R
