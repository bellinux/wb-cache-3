25|$|The Test to Measure Upper Limb Apraxia (TULIA) is {{one method}} of {{determining}} upper limb apraxia through the {{qualitative and quantitative}} assessment of gesture production. In contrast to previous publications on apraxic assessment, the <b>reliability</b> <b>and</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> TULIA was thoroughly investigated. The TULIA consists of subtests for the imitation and pantomime of non-symbolic (“put your index finger {{on top of your}} nose”), intransitive (“wave goodbye”) and transitive (“show me how to use a hammer”) gestures. Discrimination (differentiating between well- and poorly performed tasks) and recognition (indicating which object corresponds to a pantomimed gesture) tasks are also often tested for a full apraxia evaluation.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} self-report {{measures}} of EI, including the EQ-i, the Swinburne University Emotional Intelligence Test (SUEIT), and the Schutte EI model. None of these assess intelligence, abilities, or skills (as their authors often claim), but rather, they are limited measures of trait emotional intelligence. The {{most widely used}} and widely researched measure of self-report or self-schema (as it is currently referred to) emotional intelligence is the EQ-i 2.0. Originally known as the BarOn EQ-i, {{it was the first}} self-report measure of emotional intelligence available, the only measure predating Goleman's best-selling book. There are over 200 studies that have used the EQ-i or EQ-i 2.0.

The questionnaire was administered with a two week test-retest among secondary school students (n= 173, age= 13. 72 ± 1. 24).
