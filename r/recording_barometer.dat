40|$|Indoor {{positioning}} in a multi-floor {{environment by}} using a smartphone is considered in this paper. The positioning accuracy and robustness of WiFi fingerprinting-based positioning are limited due to the unexpected variation of WiFi measurements between floors. On this basis, we propose a novel smartphone-based integrated WiFi/MEMS positioning algorithm based on the robust extended Kalman filter (EKF). The proposed algorithm first relies on the gait detection approach and quaternion algorithm to estimate the velocity and heading angles of the target. Second, the velocity and heading angles, together {{with the results of}} WiFi fingerprinting-based positioning, are considered as the input of the robust EKF for the sake of conducting two-dimensional (2 D) positioning. Third, the proposed algorithm calculates the height of the target by using the real-time <b>recorded</b> <b>barometer</b> and geographic data. Finally, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves the positioning accuracy with root mean square errors (RMSEs) less than 1 m in an actual multi-floor environment...|$|R
500|$|The first {{storm to}} be {{uncovered}} in modern-day reanalysis existed in late August, and ties the July hurricane for the strongest {{system of the}} season in terms of maximum sustained winds. Its track is known between August 25 and August 30, during which time it progressed generally northeasterly from a point northeast of the island of Bermuda to the central northern Atlantic. On August 30, the Harvest Queen <b>recorded</b> a <b>barometer</b> of [...] on August 30; this report was a strong indication that the storm had attained hurricane intensity, although the system was likely undergoing its transition into an extratropical cyclone at the time.|$|R
50|$|In 1765 {{he invented}} a clock for George III which also {{acted as a}} <b>barometer,</b> <b>recording</b> air {{pressure}} against time. This is notable as the first accurate recording barograph. In 1766 he made a similar model for his personal use, which on his death was purchased by Luke Howard who used it for his observations within the book The Climate of London.|$|R
5|$|As {{the storm}} progressed westward, Tampa and nearby {{locations}} started to experience its effects. Strong winds {{from the northeast}} blew {{water out of the}} Tampa Bay to the lowest level ever <b>recorded.</b> The <b>barometer</b> fell to 961mbar (hPa; 28.4inHg), and extremely high waves battered the shore from Flamingo to Cape Romano. The surf continued well inland, forcing survivors to cling atop trees. North of Tampa, the hurricane's effects were moderate or light, while in the southwestern part of the state, damage increased in severity. A portion of the local citrus crop was destroyed. Property damage was widespread from Tampa to Jacksonville and points south. High winds tore the roofs off homes and shook some structures off their foundations.|$|R
30|$|The {{observations}} at STG 200 {{were made}} in a borehole excavated 20  m below the horizontal shafts {{at a depth of}} 200  m. The data used in this study are as follows: <b>barometer</b> <b>records</b> (at SN 3 and STG 200), water pressure records (at STG 200), stress records (at STG 200), vertical movements observed with GPS (at TOKI by GSI), acceleration record (at TOS), and STS seismogram (at MIZ). STS is a name of broadband seismometer manufactured by Streckeisen Company.|$|R
50|$|Dumas {{perfected the}} method of {{measuring}} vapor densities which was also important in determining atomic weights (see below). A known amount of the substance being analyzed was put into a previously weighed glass bulb, which was then sealed and heated in water to vaporize the substance. The pressure was <b>recorded</b> with a <b>barometer,</b> and the bulb is allowed to cool to determine {{the mass of the}} vapor. The universal gas law was then used to determine the moles of gas within the bulb.|$|R
50|$|Craig Key was {{originally}} named Camp Panama, {{and was not}} a natural island, but a wide spot on the Overseas Railroad right-of-way. It {{was originally}} a vacation spot and flag stop on the railroad. Roland W. Craig leased the island from the railroad in the early 1930s, and by 1935 the island had been named Craig, Florida. Former president Herbert Hoover sailed his yacht out of Craig at times in the 1930s. The island's greatest claim to fame, however, is being the landfall site of the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane. Captain Ivar Olsen, who had been taking refuge from the storm in his dry-docked boat near the island, <b>recorded</b> a <b>barometer</b> measurement of , the lowest sea-level atmospheric pressure ever recorded on land. The town was a total loss, but was rebuilt, and prospered as a vacation spot after the storm.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} hours of December 12, 1925 a weak tornado {{affected}} Ireland Island. Beginning as a waterspout, it moved into the Ireland IslandDock Yard. The Ormonde, a ship docked there, was nearly capsized, and the ship's <b>barometer</b> <b>recorded</b> an instantaneous drop of 4 mb. Moving onto land as a tornado, the vortex damaged roofs, sheds, and fences as it tore across the island. Interestingly, an office in the ship yard which contained another weather station was also struck - the <b>barometer</b> there <b>recorded</b> a drop of 6 mb. The damage path was approximately 300 yards across.|$|R
50|$|In 1901 he {{commenced}} researches {{into the}} problems of the upper air, and designed or perfected several instruments for use with kites, as well as a form of the Hargraves box-kite, which proved of great value. In 1905 he was appointed by the Meteorological Office director of experiments in connexion with the investigation of the upper air, and in 1907 designed a meteorograph for use with balloons. He also produced, in conjunction with Dr. Napier Shaw, the microbarograph and a <b>recording</b> mercury <b>barometer,</b> as well as various other instruments. From 1901 to 1902 he was President of the Royal Meteorological Society and in 1905 was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Although he was never a full-time academic, {{he was a member of}} the International Commission for Scientific Aeronautics, and became an honorary or corresponding member of various foreign scientific societies. He is the author of many important papers on the meteorology of the upper atmosphere which appeared in the Transactions of the Royal Society, the Geophysical Memoirs of the Meteorological Office and elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|Tropical Cyclone Mahina was {{the most}} intense {{tropical}} cyclone to cross the Australian coast in historical times. Its central pressure was <b>recorded</b> by <b>barometer</b> at 27 inches (914 hPa) as the eye approached the coast at Bathurst Bay (Figure 1) at approximately 4. 30 am on the 22 nd March 1899 (Whittingham 1958). Over 300 persons lost their lives when a fleet of pearling luggers and schooners were wrecked and sunk by the phenomenal seas. One {{of the most interesting}} aspects of this event was the eyewitness report of a 43 foot (13 m) surge at Ninian Bay adjacent to Barrow Point 30 km south of Bathurst Bay which extended inland for 2 – 3 miles (3 – 5 km). Constable Kenny, camped on a ridge fully 40 foot above sea level, was inundated to his waist by a ‘tidal wave’ (storm surge and associated ephemeral sea level rise) at his camp site some 0. 5 miles (800 m) inland at approximately 5 am (Anonymous 1899). This account suggests this surge was the largest ever recorded in Australia...|$|R

30|$|High-quality data {{concerning}} the Tohoku Earthquake (M 9.0) on March 11, 2011, {{were obtained from the}} deep borehole observation network (maximum depth of 1030  m; epicentral distance of approximately 600  km) of the Tono Research Institute of Earthquake Science. In addition to data acquired via seismometers, stress meters, and strain meters, barometric seismograms were <b>recorded</b> by several <b>barometers</b> that are usually used for weather observations. We examined the characteristics of barometric and stress seismograms and compared them to the data obtained using broadband seismometers, finding a shared feature: large amplitudes and long-period waveforms began with the arrival of surface waves. We also investigated the relationship between vertical movements observed with GPS and barometric variations and discovered that the barometric variations were related to the differential of vertical movements, while the vertical movements corresponded to the integral of barometric variations. All these results demonstrate that vertical movements at observation points can be computed from the barometric variations observed at those points.|$|R
40|$|Through the centuries, {{engagement}} with the Bible {{has served as a}} <b>barometer</b> (<b>recording</b> and reflec­ting the history of shifting circumstances), as a beacon (constituting a source of light illuminating theological reflection and guiding human conduct) and as a bellwether (leading the way in setting new agendas for the Church, her theology and her encounter with the world.) Against this back­ ground, the history of biblical engagement through the centuries is briefly traced. The main focus of the article is, however, to reflect {{on the role of the}} Bible in the next millenium. The author foresees an even stronger ecumenical engagement, an enhanced focus on a critical faith and a self-critical rationality, a stronger rejection of absolutist claims, renewed respect for the diversity of voices in the biblical canon, the emergence of biblical study to an attentive dialogue partner within other fields of human knowledge and a renewed search for wisdom in the Bible in future in order to face the problems which will confront humankind. Against the background of these developments the study of the Bible will, in the third millenium, become even more an interconfessional, international, interdisciplinary and intersocial enterprise, sustained by the conviction that the Bible is a holy and privileged word, both about human existence and humanity’s relation to God, society, history, and the cosmos...|$|R
500|$|In East Texas, {{where the}} {{hurricane}} made landfall late on August7, strong winds were felt across the region. Sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) were widespread, with occasional gusts peaking {{in excess of}} 90mph (145km/h). In Port Arthur, a <b>barometer</b> <b>recorded</b> a minimum pressure of 978mbar (hPa; 28.87inHg), establishing a new record for the lowest pressure measured by the particular weather station. The same station recorded 5.87in (149.1mm) of rainfall. Elsewhere in Port Arthur, strong winds caused significant damage to local oil refineries, with slight to moderate damage to other homes and businesses. Six people were injured in the city. Property damage in Jefferson County, containing Port Arthur and nearby suburbs, was estimated at $1million. The city's communication and power service was cut during the storm. A weather station near Sabine Pass recorded a similarly low pressure of 973mbar (hPa; 28.74inHg). In Sabine Pass, strong winds unroofed houses, uprooted trees, and destroyed billboards. At the nearby Ged Oil Field, four wooden oil derricks were blown down. In Beaumont, three people were injured due to flying window and structural debris. Further inland, the hurricane produced considerable rainfall, though relatively less than in Louisiana. Six weather stations in the state set new 24–hour precipitation records for August. A measurement of 6.99in (177.4mm) on August8 in Kirbyville was the highest of these records. However, maximum rainfall in the state {{was estimated to be}} in excess of 10in (255mm). The rice crop was particularly damaged by the rainfall. In Jefferson County, crop damage was estimated between $450,000–$500,000. In Texas, the hurricane caused $1.75million in damages and resulted in one fatality.|$|R
