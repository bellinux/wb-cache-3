50|$|A <b>reverse</b> <b>connection</b> {{is usually}} used to bypass {{firewall}} restrictions on open ports. A firewall usually blocks incoming connections on open ports, {{but does not}} block outgoing traffic. In a normal forward connection, a client connects to a server through the server's open port, {{but in the case}} of a <b>reverse</b> <b>connection,</b> the client opens the port that the server connects to.The most common way a <b>reverse</b> <b>connection</b> is used is to bypass firewall and router security restrictions.|$|E
50|$|For example, a {{backdoor}} {{running on}} a computer behind a firewall that blocks incoming connections can easily open an outbound connection to a remote host on the Internet. Once the connection is established, the remote host can send commands to the backdoor.Remote administration tools (RAT) that use a <b>reverse</b> <b>connection</b> usually send SYN packets to the client's IP address. The client listens for these SYN packets and accepts the desired connections.|$|E
5000|$|Beast is a Windows-based {{backdoor}} trojan horse, {{more commonly}} {{known in the}} hacking community as a Remote Administration Tool or a [...] "RAT". It is capable of infecting versions of Windows from 95 to 10. Written in Delphi and released first by its author Tataye in 2002, it became quite popular due to its unique features. It used the typical client-server model where the client would be under operation by the attacker and the server is what would infect the victim. Beast {{was one of the}} first trojans to feature a <b>reverse</b> <b>connection</b> to its victims, and once established it gave the attacker complete control over the infected computer. The virus would be harmless until opened. When opened, the virus would use the code injection method to inject itself into other applications.|$|E

40|$|We present RON, an {{efficient}} and effective framework for generic object detection. Our motivation is to smartly associate {{the best of the}} region-based (e. g., Faster R-CNN) and region-free (e. g., SSD) methodologies. Under fully convolutional architecture, RON mainly focuses on two fundamental problems: (a) multi-scale object localization and (b) negative sample mining. To address (a), we design the <b>reverse</b> <b>connection,</b> which enables the network to detect objects on multi-levels of CNNs. To deal with (b), we propose the objectness prior to significantly reduce the searching space of objects. We optimize the <b>reverse</b> <b>connection,</b> objectness prior and object detector jointly by a multi-task loss function, thus RON can directly predict final detection results from all locations of various feature maps. Extensive experiments on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO benchmarks demonstrate the competitive performance of RON. Specifically, with VGG- 16 and low resolution 384 X 384 input size, the network gets 81. 3 % mAP on PASCAL VOC 2007, 80. 7 % mAP on PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets. Its superiority increases when datasets become larger and more difficult, as demonstrated by the results on the MS COCO dataset. With 1. 5 G GPU memory at test phase, the speed of the network is 15 FPS, 3 X faster than the Faster R-CNN counterpart.

40|$|Abstract. We {{continue}} {{the study of}} the efficiency of black-box reductions in cryptography. We focus on the question of constructing strong one-way functions (respectively, permutations) from weak one-way functions (respectively, permutations). To make our impossibility results stronger, we focus on the weakest type of constructions: those that start from a weak one-way permutation and define a strong one-way function. We show that for every “fully black-box ” construction of a ɛ(n) -secure function based on a (1 − δ(n)) -secure permutation, if q(n) is the number of oracle queries used in the construction and ℓ(n) is the input length of the new function, then we have q ≥ Ω (1 1 · log) and ℓ ≥ n + Ω(log 1 /ɛ) − δ ɛ O(log q). This result is proved by showing that fully black-box reductions of strong to weak one-way functions imply the existence of “hitters ” and then by applying known lower bounds for hitters. We also show a sort of <b>reverse</b> <b>connection,</b> and we revisit the construction of Goldreich et al. (FOCS 1990) in terms of this <b>reverse</b> <b>connection.</b> Finally, we prove that any “weakly black-box ” construction with parameters q(n) and ℓ(n) better than the above lower bounds implies the unconditional existence of strong one-way functions (and, therefore, the existence of a weakly black-box construction with q(n) = 0). This result, like the one for fully black-box reductions, is proved by reasoning about the function defined by such a construction when using the identity permutation as an oracle. ...|$|E
