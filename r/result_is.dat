5|$|The {{second stage}} of {{catalysis}} is {{the resolution of the}} acyl-enzyme intermediate by the attack of a second substrate.

Attack by this second substrate forms a new tetrahedral intermediate, which resolves by ejecting the enzyme's nucleophile, releasing the second product and regenerating free enzyme.|$|E

The more similar the concepts in the <b>results</b> <b>are</b> to the concepts contained in the query, the more relevant the <b>results</b> <b>are</b> considered to <b>be.</b> <b>Results</b> <b>are</b> usually ranked and sorted by relevance so that the most relevant <b>results</b> <b>are</b> {{at the top of the}} list of results and the least relevant <b>results</b> <b>are</b> at the bottom of the list.|$|R

5|$|If one removes from a 1-tree one of {{the edges}} in its cycle, the <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a tree. Reversing this process, if one augments a tree by {{connecting}} any two of its vertices by a new edge, the <b>result</b> <b>is</b> a 1-tree; the path in the tree connecting the two endpoints of the added edge, together with the added edge itself, form the 1-tree's unique cycle. If one augments a 1-tree by adding an edge that connects one of its vertices to a newly added vertex, the <b>result</b> <b>is</b> again a 1-tree, with one more vertex; an alternative method for constructing 1-trees is {{to start with a}} single cycle and then repeat this augmentation operation any number of times. The edges of any 1-tree can be partitioned in a unique way into two subgraphs, one of which is a cycle and the other of which is a forest, such that each tree of the forest contains exactly one vertex of the cycle.|$|E
