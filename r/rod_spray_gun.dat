5000|$|Fabrican is a spray-on {{material}} {{made from}} polymers and natural or synthetic fibres. The spray is delivered from a compressed air <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> or aerosol can and dries instantly on {{contact with the}} air, creating a non-woven fabric {{that can be applied}} to many surfaces (including water). [...] The material is completely sterile when it is dispensed from the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> or aerosol can.|$|R
50|$|High volume low {{pressure}} (HVLP) {{is similar to}} a conventional <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> using a compressor to supply the air, but the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> itself requires a lower pressure (LP). A higher volume (HV) of air is used to aerosolise and propel the paint at lower air pressure. The result is a higher proportion of paint reaching the target surface with reduced overspray, materials consumption, and air pollution.A regulator is often required so that the air pressure from a conventional compressor can be lowered for the HVLP <b>spray</b> <b>gun.</b> Alternatively a turbine unit (commonly containing a vacuum cleaner derived motor) can be used to propel the air without the need for an air line running to the compressor.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the {{trajectory}} planning process of spray painting robot, {{an approach to}} automatic trajectory generation of <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> using point cloud slicing is presented. Firstly, the point cloud data is obtained by scanning {{the surface of the}} workpiece. After the uniform slicing of point cloud model, the spraying position is determined by the average sampling of cross-section contours. Then the normal vectors of the sampling points are estimated. Finally {{the trajectory}} of <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> is generated by offsetting the sampling points along their normal vectors. Experimental results show that the method has good feasibility and effectiveness. The spraying trajectory, direction and distance of <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> can be controlled accurately, thus the spraying quality and efficiency are improved...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMaterial {{consumption}} and {{dry film thickness}} are the two main indicators for identifying the efficiency of spray coating process. Using a proper spray condition, less material consumption could be obtained as per a given dry film thickness. This paper presents the influences of supplying- air pressure, spray time and nozzle size of <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> on the weight of material used per shot and the dry film thickness obtained. A high- volume-low-pressure type <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> was used to atomize and deliver a liquid solution of Teflon depositing on a flat work surface. The experimental results showed that low spray time, large nozzle size and low spray pressure {{were responsible for the}} increased material {{consumption and}} dry film thickness. The optimization was performed, where the material consumption was minimized and the dry film thickness was set within a specified standard. Based on the geometric interaction between the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> and work-piece, a spray coating model in this application, which is considered unique was also developed and discussed in this paper. Moreover, this paper demonstrates a determination of the coefficient of spray coating process (k) through a relationship between coating thickness and material consumption using data obtained from the experiment. As a result, a relationship among the dry film thickness and positions of the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> was established and {{it can be used to}} predict the coating thickness. In conclusion, the optimal conditions in the spray coating process was determined to minimize material consumption whereas the developed spray coating model predicts the coating thickness related to the position of the <b>spray</b> <b>gun.</b> This model will substantially reduce <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> setup time during production in order to obtain required dry film thickness...|$|R

In {{comparison}} with typical external feedstock mode, powders internal injecting method can effectively enhance plasma sprayed ceramic coatings performance and improve powder deposition efficiency. In this feedstock mode, spray powders were {{injected into the}} hotter regions of a plasma jet, which had enough heat capacity to melt most of the particles instantly. Currently, several plasma <b>spray</b> <b>guns</b> in internal feedstock mode, such as Axial III and SG 100, have been developed and commercialized. In this paper, characteristics of plasma <b>spray</b> <b>guns</b> in internal and external feedstock methods were summarized.

40|$|In spray {{painting}} applications, {{it is essential}} to generate a <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> trajectory such that the entire surface is completely covered and receives an acceptably uniform layer of paint deposition; we call this the “uniform coverage ” problem. The uniform coverage problem is challenging because the atomizer emits a non-trivial paint distribution, thus making the relationships between the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> trajectory and the deposition uniformity complex. To understand the key issues involved in uniform coverage, we consider surface patches that are geodesically convex and topologically simple as representative of subsets of realistic automotive surfaces. In addition to ensuring uniform paint deposition on the surface, our goal is to also minimize the associated process cycle time and paint waste. Based on the relationships between the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> trajectory and the output characteristics (i. e., uniformity, cycle time and paint waste), ou...|$|R

50|$|The {{processing}} {{steps are}} very similar to those in hand lay-up. In this process, the release agent is first applied to the mould and then a layer of gelcoat is applied. The gelcoat is left for two hours, until it hardens. Once the gelcoat hardens, a <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> is used to deposit the fibre resin mixture onto the surface of the mould. The <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> chops the incoming continuous rovings (one or more rovings) to a predetermined length and impels it through the resin/catalyst mixture. Resin/catalyst mixing can take place inside the gun (gun mixing) or {{just in front of the}} gun. Gun mixing provides thorough mixing of resin and catalyst inside the gun and is preferred to minimize the health hazard concerns of the operator. In the other type, the catalyst is sprayed through two side nozzles into the resin envelope. Airless <b>spray</b> <b>guns</b> are becoming popular because they provide more controlled spray patterns and reduced emission of volatiles. In an airless system, hydraulic pressure is used to dispense the resin through special nozzles that break up the resin stream into small droplets which then become saturated with the reinforcements. In an air-atomized <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> system, pressurized air is used to dispense the resin.|$|R
50|$|Upon departing the <b>spray</b> <b>gun,</b> the {{graphene}} flake’s {{tendency to}} aggregate is reduced {{due to its}} quick evaporation and dispersion. Much to the researchers’ surprise, this spray method produces flakes that contain substantially less defects that would commonly occur. Common graphene defects including holes and lumps in the layer, and the Stone-Wales defect were absent upon surface impact. The large amount of kinetic energy delivered by the supersonic nozzle creates the healing of these defects, as the graphene flakes stretches upon impact. The carbon atoms within the graphene rearrange to create seamlessly perfect hexagonal lattice structures. The result of these perfect hexagon structures {{is the creation of}} a smooth, even layer of graphene. This is a large contrast to the applications of graphene onto large-scale substrates prior {{to the creation of the}} graphene <b>spray</b> <b>gun.</b> The graphene layers would commonly contain defecting clumps and spaces, which troubled scientists ever since the discovery of graphene. The graphene <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> is also regarded as inexpensive when compared to the other methods of large-scale graphene applications. One main factor for its inexpensiveness is that the graphene layers require no post-processing treatment, which was common in the other methods. The other factor is that the <b>spray</b> <b>gun</b> is remarkably simple in both its production and utilization.|$|R
