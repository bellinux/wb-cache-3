500|$|Language and {{literacy}} have far reaching effects as they facilitate self-expression and social interaction {{in a variety}} of settings. Furthermore, literacy fosters independence by providing access to educational and vocational opportunities. Children whose disabilities require AAC often experience developmental delays in language skills such as vocabulary knowledge, length of sentences, syntax, and impaired pragmatic skills. These delays may be {{due in part to the}} fact that expressive language is limited by more than the children's own language knowledge. Unlike speaking children, children who use AAC do not always have access to their AAC system, and don't select the content available on the device. These external characteristics may impact language learning opportunities. Most children in this category do not achieve literacy skills beyond that of a typically developing 7–8 year old. [...] Cognitive, language and learning delays contribute to difficulty with literacy development, but environmental factors also play a role. The most literate AAC users often report having access to abundant reading and writing material at home as well as in school during childhood. Studies have shown that many children who use AAC have literacy experiences that are reduced quality, quantity, and opportunity at home and at school as compared to children without disabilities. Research suggests that with explicit <b>reading</b> <b>instruction,</b> AAC users can develop good literacy skills.|$|E

However, since foreign language instruction in that country was heavily focused on <b>reading</b> <b>instruction,</b> no textbooks, other materials or courses existed at the time, so new methods and materials had to be devised. For example, the U.S. Army Specialized Training Program created intensive programs based on the techniques Leonard Bloomfield and other linguists devised for Native American languages, where students interacted intensively with native speakers and a linguist in guided conversations designed to decode its basic grammar and learn the vocabulary. This [...] "informant method" [...] had great success with its small class sizes and motivated learners.|$|E

50|$|Concept-Oriented <b>Reading</b> <b>Instruction</b> (CORI) was {{developed}} in 1993 by Dr. John T. Guthrie {{with a team of}} elementary teachers and graduate students. The project designed and implemented a framework of conceptually oriented <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> to improve students' amount and breadth of reading, intrinsic motivations for reading, and strategies of search and comprehension. The framework emphasized five phases of <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> in a content domain: observing and personalizing, searching and retrieving, comprehending and integrating, communicating to others, and interacting with peers to construct meaning. CORI instruction was contrasted to experience-based teaching and strategy instruction in terms of its support for motivational and cognitive development.|$|E

40|$|Researchers and {{educators}} have made great efforts {{to be conscious}} of students' wide and varied learning processes and to meet individual learners' different needs in one classroom with well-conceptualized and balanced strategy assessment and instruction. Reading is considered very important in academic worlds, including Korea, where English is learned as a second or foreign language (ESL/EFL). Ongoing debates about <b>reading</b> strategy <b>instruction,</b> {{as well as a}} lack of methodological consistency in previous language studies, make it particularly difficult for EFL teachers to know how to implement strategy instruction in their classrooms. Therefore, {{this study was designed to}} examine the effect of <b>reading</b> strategy <b>instruction</b> (a) on strategy use while reading in a target language (L 2) and (b) on L 2 reading comprehension. The secondary purposes of this study were to examine (c) the effectiveness of color-coding as a new strategy assessment tool and (d) the influence of L 2 <b>reading</b> strategy <b>instruction</b> on <b>reading</b> in a native language (L 1). The results were very interesting, both theoretically and in practice. First, <b>reading</b> strategy <b>instruction</b> helped learners develop reading strategy knowledge and raise the reading strategy awareness. Second, <b>reading</b> strategy <b>instruction</b> also promoted text-specific strategy use, but not general strategy use, probably because of the short period of the intervention. In a wash-back process, <b>reading</b> strategy <b>instruction,</b> though focused entirely on L 2 reading strategies, also improved Korean (L 1) reading strategy use. Third, <b>reading</b> strategy <b>instruction</b> helped learners improve their L 2 reading comprehension. Fourth, participants' prior knowledge of English grammar served as a confidence-building comfort zone for learning how to use (a) new reading strategies and (b) a new reading strategy assessment tool, color-coding. Fifth, the innovative color-coding technique proved to be effective for measuring text-specific reading strategy use.
