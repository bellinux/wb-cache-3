40|$|Mutation {{induction}} and biotechnological {{techniques are}} current approaches used in plant breeding. At present work, both methodologies were combined {{in order to}} obtain a mutation-breeding model in avocado. In vitro germination and rooting of zygotic embryos, sprout multiplication and plantlets adaptation in Cuban avocado varieties were studied. Percentage of germinated entire embryos were higher using mature than immature embryos. Near of 80 % of entire plantlets obtained by embryo culture technique were adapted to greenhouse conditions. Based on inhibition of entire sprout fraction, <b>radiosensibility</b> curves for Duke and Hass varieties were developed. Inhibition of entire sprout fraction was described by a second order polynomial equation. Fit of experimental data and theoretical model was equal to 0. 96 and 0. 95 for Hass and Duke <b>radiosensibility</b> curves, respectively. LD 50 values defined as the dose, at which the 50 % of entire sprout fraction are inhi-bited, were determined in 27 and 28 Gy for Hass and Duke varieties, respectively. Gamma-rays mutagenic doses for zygotic embryos of both varieties were also established between 19 and 25 Gy. Applied mutagenic dose did not affect significantly plantlets development. However, leaf and root anomalies, atrophied and chlorophyll-deficient shoots and albinism were observed at doses higher than LD 50 values. The usefulness of the combined approach to improve avocado varieties was discussed. This in vitro methodology appears as an alternative to traditional breeding met-hods, particularly for improving agronomic characteristics as rot-root resistance and salt toleran-ce in avocado...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{protocols}} of concomitant chemo/radiotherapy {{provide a}} very effective strategy to treat certain types of tumors. High-linear energy transfer (LET) radiations, on the other hand, have an increased efficacy against cancer with low <b>radiosensibility</b> and critical localization. We previously reported that oxaliplatin, a third generation platinum drug, was able to reinforce the cytotoxicity of an irradiation by fast neutrons towards human glioblastoma U- 87 cells in culture. We show here that such a combination {{has the capacity to}} enhance the number of double strand breaks in DNA and to induce autophagy in these cells. Xenografts experiments were further performed in nude mice subcutaneously transplanted with U- 87 cells. When injected shortly before a single irradiation by fast neutrons, oxaliplatin causes a marked reduction of tumor growth compared with the irradiation alone. Overall, our data indicate the unique cytotoxic mechanism of a combined high-LET irradiation and oxaliplatin treatment modality and suggest its potential application in anticancer therapy.

40|$|Somatic {{embryogenesis}} is {{a useful}} process for clonal propagation and genetic improvement by induction of mutations. This work was carried out {{with the objective of}} determining the effect of 60 Co source Gamma radiations on embryogenic cell suspensions of banana cv. 'Grande naine' (Musa AAA) until conversion to plants. Different doses of radiation (0, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80 Gy) were applied to embryogenic cell suspensions in the multiplication phase and the embryos were later formed, matured and germinated. To determine the ex vitro response of the population of plants obtained these were transferred to greenhouse. The results showed that with somatic embryos formed fresh mass no differences were observed between the effect of the different doses of radiation applied and the control. However, the radiation dose affected the percentage of somatic embryo formation and germination. Plants with phenotypic variations were regenerated with 40 Gy. The results at the greenhouse showed that as radiation doses increased up to 50 Gy, the frequency of variations increased. With higher doses of radiation the survival of the plants was affected.   Keywords: Gamma radiation, in vitro mutagenesis, radiation dose, <b>radiosensibility,</b> somatic embry...|$|E
40|$|Breas t cancer {{heads the}} list of {{malignant}} neoplasms in women. In this connection the regional forms of cancer are diagnosed in one fourth of the patients. The treatment of regional cancer begins with systemic therapy and aimed at gaining of state fit for operation. The choice of modern treatment strategy is based on determination of molecular subtype of the tumor. One of them is referred to HER- 2 -positive cancer, requiring the administration of additional targeted therapy. This form of cancer is referred to prognostically pejorative tumors, as it’s more aggressive, leads to fast metastasis and early death of the patients. The “golden standard” of systemic chemotherapy is defined as administration of docetaxel and trastuzumab,  and antracyclic drugs, which also prove to be efficient. However concomitant administration of trastuzumab and antracyclines is limited due to their cardiotoxicity. Chemotherapy is not always efficient and, upon recommendations both of Russian and international oncologists, radiotherapy is {{the next stage of}} treatment. The question about <b>radiosensibility</b> of HER- 2 -positive tumors is still open and worth studying. Addition of radiotherapy to regional cancer treatment regimen in combination with the targeted therapy and chemotherapy may contribute to obtaining better survival rate and disease control. There are still no clearly defined standard for the sequence of chemo-radiation therapy. Simultaneous  chemo-radiatiojn  therapy results in  reliably better loco-regional control of tumor and  enables to gain a  higher degree of pathomorphological response on the one hand, and it may result in development of serious adverse effects on the other hand. Striving for improvement of immediate results of antineoplastic therapy, including that of regional cancer, by combining various methods, one should keep in mind the increasing action toxicity, which may have a considerable impact on the patients’ quality of living. Continuation of experiments and clinical trials in this direction is rather actual, as it allows getting new data for treatment of regional breast cancer. </p...|$|E
40|$|By {{conducting}} a histological {{study on the}} parametrial tissues of the cervical carcinoma in 237 patients previously irradiated with a small dose of X-ray, the author investigated the <b>radiosensibility</b> of the parametium with special references {{to the relationship between}} the changes in mitotic picture and giant cells on one hand and the C. P. L. and Nagase's classifications on the other. Those receiving 1 - 12 x 300 r were 215 cases and they were divided into 2 groups of 6 or 12 times; and also the deep dosis of X-ray was estimated. By obtaining the tissues of cervical carcinoma after hysterectomy, tissue specimens were prepared by Hamazaki's sublimate fixation and stained in a 1. 0 % Bomer's hematoxylin solution. The following are {{the results of the present}} study. 1. The cancer infiltration in the parametrial tissues has been found in 27. 8 per cent of the cases studied, and this proves on the left side to be one and half times as great as that on the right side tissues. Moreover, this infiltration is contiguous with the regions adjacent to the cervix and is situated mostly near the uterine arteries. And the cancer infiltration in the parametrial tissues in the C. P. L. classification revealed type L twice as many as type C, and the same in Nagase's classification showed more of types Ⅱ and Ⅲ (particularly type Ⅱ) than type Ⅰ. 2. The changes of the cancer tissues in the parametrial tissues after X-ray irradiation as well as of Feulgen reaction are directly proportional to the amount of X-ray irradiated. 3. The changes in mitosis, atypical cell-division and giant cell appearance clearly paralleled with the amount of X-ray employed. Mitoses decrease after 1 - 4 times of irradiation, and are arrested thereafter. The atypical cell division increases sensitively after 1 - 3 times of irradiation, while giant cells increase rapidly after 12 times of irradiation. 4. Relative to the C. P. L. classification, in the cases given 6 irradiations giant cells increase in type L, but in the cases with 12 irradiations mitoses decrease, and in the cases showing an increase in atypical cell division changes due to X-ray are strong in type C. 5. With respect to Nagase's classification in the cases given six times of irradiation the changes due to X-ray are marked in type Ⅰ with a decrease in mitoses and type Ⅱ with an increase in giant cells, while in the casese irradiated 12 times the changes are striking in type Ⅰ with an increase in giant cells. In other words, proportionately with the increase in the amount of X-ray, the changes in connective tissues become greater in type C and type Ⅰ. 6. Considering various atypical cell divisions according to the shape of each cell such a cell division increases well proportionately to the amount of X-ray irradiated in respective case, but by 12 irradiations (especially in type C) cells are condensed at first and then the atypical cell division increases at the terminal stage...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} Secondary Malignant Neoplasms (SMNs) after {{radiotherapy}} {{is becoming a}} topic of interest nowadays, {{as a consequence of}} the higher healing rates and life expectancy accomplished with current diagnose procedures and radiotherapy treatments. In the case of modern techniques, there is a tendency to prefer low (i. e. 6 MV) energies to high ones (e. g. 15 or 18 MV), sometimes to the detriment of treatment conformity, as the latter are known to increase equivalent dose to patients due to neutron production. The Medical Physics Group of the University of Seville, pioneered the development of a simple and universal methodology for the estimation of peripheral neutron doses, based on the correlation between readings of a SRAM-based detector (in a reference location, far from the patient) and those of passive detectors, located inside an adult anthropomorphic phantom. This correspondence model directly links detector readings (referring to thermal neutron fluence in the room) to equivalent neutron doses at specific organs in the patient. One of the main problems of this methodology was the need of using the specific SRAM-based digital detector for the characterization of every facility. In addition, the passive behavior of plastic and thermoluminiscent devices used for ‘in-phantom’ measurements, together with their limitations in these environments, restricted the repetition and reliability of some critical points. The acquisition of a new prototype of a miniaturized active thermal neutron detector, initially designed for nuclear purposes, opened the possibility of improving the existing peripheral neutron dose estimation methodology in high-energy radiotherapy. The goal of this work was the use of these devices for the validation, improvement and generalization of the existing models, in order to make the real time estimation of peripheral neutron doses directly available in any facility. The online disposal of thermal neutron fluence estimations from the new TNRD detectors (Thermal Neutron Rate Detector), allowed the simplification and generalization of this procedure. Thus, making it feasible with any thermal neutron detector following a simple characterization procedure. Additionally, their active and miniaturized behavior permitted their use in both locations ‘in-phantom’ and external (for patient measurements). In order to enhace the existing models, further and more precise measurements of real radiotherapy treatments were performed with TNRD detectors, ensuring that the two existing model locations (i. e. H&N and abdomen) are general enough to cover any specific treatment. We thought that at this stage, patient age and anatomy was an important aspect that should be taken into account for second cancer risk estimations, being of special importance for children, whose life expectancy and <b>radiosensibility</b> are greater. For that, measurements with the new miniaturized active devices were performed for three different phantom sizes (child, teen and adult). Once these results were implemented, this new methodology was applied to 510 patients, starting the generation of an improved database that would allow a more patient specific analysis of second cancer risk, as a consequence of neutron contamination. Besides, the analytical peripheral photon model simultaneously developed by our group, has allowed the generation of a piece of software for the estimation of both peripheral doses. This has enabled a quick assessment of photon and neutron peripheral doses in clinical routine, from readily available parameters. Estimations of these doses were finally evaluated for some of the most common tumor locations, comparing conventional techniques and fractionations (3 D-CRT, IMRT, VMAT) to newer ones (SBRT, FFF), regarding the three main linac manufacturers and energies (6, 10, and 15 MV). As a general pattern, hypofractionated modality, 10 MV photon energy and FFF irradiation mode have shown as the best alternatives in terms of peripheral dose reduction. Thus, a combined use of these options would imply a decrease of second cancer probability. Second cancer risk estimations could be easily performed from the here presented procedures by the direct use of the existing risk models, established by the international organisms (i. e. ICRP or BEIR). The universal methodology presented aims to provide an objective additional criterion (Second Cancer Probability, SCP), to be used in combination wih the previously existing radiobiological parameters as Tumor Control Prrobability (TCP) and Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP), for the choice of the best radiotherapy strategy, thanks to its easy implementation in Treatment Planning Systems...|$|E
