40|$|Abstract — An elastic {{dumbbell}} spacecraft {{is assumed}} to consist of two identical mass particles that are connected by a long elastic link. The motion of the dumbbell spacecraft can be described by orbit, attitude and shape dynamics that arise due to gravitational forces, an elastic restoring force along the longitudinal axis of the spacecraft, and control forces that act to change the attitude {{and shape of the}} spacecraft. These control forces have the property that there is no net external force on the dumbbell spacecraft. Since the angular momentum of the spacecraft is necessarily conserved, Routh <b>reduced</b> <b>equations</b> of motion are developed that describe the reduced dynamics of the controlled spacecraft. The <b>reduced</b> <b>equations</b> of motion are developed; relative equilibria are determined, and simplified <b>reduced</b> <b>equations,</b> in a linear form, are obtained.

40|$|A reduced basis {{technique}} and a problem-adaptive computational algorithm are presented for the bifurcation and post-buckling analysis of laminated anisotropic plates. The computational algorithm can be conveniently {{divided into three}} distinct stages. The first stage is that of determining the bifurcation point. The plate is discretized by using displacement finite element (or finite difference) models. The special symmetries exhibited by {{the response of the}} anisotropic plate are used {{to reduce the size of}} the analysis region. The vector of unknown nodal parameters is expressed as a linear combination of a small number of basis vectors, and a Rayleigh-Ritz technique is used to approximate the finite element equations by a small system of algebraic equations. The <b>reduced</b> <b>equations</b> are used to determine the bifurcation point and the associated eigenmode of the panel.

That means that for minimally-coupled scalar field cosmology or other modified theories which are conformally related with scalar-field cosmology, like f(R) gravity, the application of Hojman's method provide us with the same results with that of Noether's Theorem.
