The Mk1 and Mk3 are equipped with a Doppler velocity system (DVS) which provides relative ground velocities; the DVS is also linked into the AFCS {{as part of the}} autostabilisation system. For safety, the aircraft is equipped with obstacle and terrain avoidance warning systems, traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), and both voice and flight data recorders.|$|E
5|$|The captain {{asked for}} the descent {{checklist}} at 20:24:24. The fasten seat belt sign was switched on and the flight attendant started the process of preparing the cabin for landing. At 20:24:46 the captain, {{as part of the}} checklist, informed the first officer that they would go down to 1,500 ft at Torghatten and then down to 550ft. This was followed first by a partially unreadable conversation between the captain and the first officers, which included if they were to fill fuel, and then an unreadable conversation between the captain and the jump seat passenger.

25|$|The <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> {{system had}} {{recently}} been calibrated twice and the commission found {{nothing wrong with the}} navigational aids. On the other hand, the aircraft's equipment had been turned to compass instead of antenna. This would have made the beam north of the cone of silence twenty degrees wide instead of four. Although not decisive, it was cited as giving the pilot a disadvantage in navigation. The aircraft's <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> equipment also lacked a marker beacon receiver, due to lack of sufficient parts. This forced the pilots to manually calculate the distance to the beacon. The crew carried out the procedural turn in the right area, but should, according to their route instruction book, have been at no lower an altitude than , thus the aircraft was too low, caused by the let-down being started too early.|$|E

25|$|Matawan {{played an}} {{important}} role in aviation navigation history. In 1944, the first operational Visual Aural Range (VAR) was installed at Matawan. Designed in 1937 at the Bureau of Air Commerce's research center, this system operated in the VHF band around 63 mHz and was an incremental improvement over prior aviation navigation systems such as the four-course <b>radio</b> <b>range.</b> VAR was later redeveloped into VOR.|$|E

25|$|Because of the above, St Helena Airport was {{equipped}} with an instrument landing system (ILS) and a Doppler VHF Omni-directional <b>Radio</b> <b>Range</b> system (DVOR) supplied by Thales Group. Further to that Honeywell Aerospace supplied a SmartPath ground-based augmentation system (GBAS), a technology that augments global positioning system (GPS) signals to make them suitable for precision approach and landing. It overcomes many {{of the limitations of}} instrument landing systems (ILS) traditionally used by airports to guide aircraft as they approach the runway.|$|E
25|$|Man-made EMI (electromagnetic interference) {{can also}} disrupt or jam GPS signals. In one {{well-documented}} {{case it was}} impossible to receive GPS signals in the entire harbor of Moss Landing, California due to unintentional jamming caused by malfunctioning TV antenna preamplifiers. Intentional jamming is also possible. Generally, stronger signals can interfere with GPS receivers when they are within <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> or line of sight. In 2002 a detailed description of how to build a short-range GPS L1 C/A jammer was published in the online magazine Phrack.|$|E

25|$|In February 1940 at Wright Field, the Army Air Corps {{established}} the Technical Data Branch (Technical Data Section in July 1941, Technical Data Laboratory in 1942). After Air Corps Ferrying Command was established on 29 May 1941, on 21 June an installation {{point of the}} command opened at Patterson Field. The Flight Test Training unit of Air Technical Command was established at Wright Field on 9 September 1944 (moved to Patterson Field in 1946, Edwards AFB on 4 February 1951). Two densely populated housing and service areas across Highway 444, Wood City and Skyway Park, were geographically separated from the central core of Patterson Field and developed almost self-sufficient community status. (Wood City was acquired in 1924 {{as part of the}} original donation of land to the government but was used primarily as just a <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> until World War II. Skyway Park was acquired in 1943.) They supported the vast numbers of recruits who enlisted and were trained at the two fields as well as thousands of civilian laborers, especially single women recruited to work at the depot. Skyway Park was demolished after the war. Wood City was eventually transformed into Kittyhawk Center, the base's modern commercial and recreation center.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} month Ferrarin and del Prete did indeed cross the Atlantic in the S.64, not to New York, {{but across the}} South Atlantic to Brazil. Departing Montecelio {{on the evening of}} 3 July, they flew over Sardinia overnight, and then Gibraltar early the next morning. During 4 July their course covered Casablanca and Villa Cisneros, and by that evening they were over the Cape Verde islands and headed for Brazil. On the morning of 5 July, they were within <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> of Pernambuco. Crossing the Brazilian coast near Natal, they continued south, hoping to reach Rio de Janeiro. However, poor weather forced the aviators to turn back towards Natal. Now running low on fuel and with the weather still against them, they were forced to abandon landing there as well, since the aerodrome lay behind a row of hills. Instead, they continued north for another 160km (100mi) and made a forced landing on a beach at Touros. A Brazilian mail plane conveyed Ferrarin and del Prete first to Natal and then to Rio de Janeiro, where in both cities they were given a heroes' welcome. The S.64 suffered structural damage during its landing on the sand, and was brought to Rio de Janeiro by ship. When it arrived in the city, it was donated to Brazil. During the flight from Italy, the S.64 had covered 8,100km (5,030mi) in 48 hours, 14 minutes. The FAI officially recognised this as a flight of 7,188km (4,500mi) – the orthodromic distance between Montecelio and Natal – and a new world straight-line distance record. The festivities in Rio de Janeiro continued for weeks, but came to an end when Ferrarin and del Prete crashed during a demonstration flight in a S.62 on 11 August. Del Prete died from his injuries five days later.|$|E
