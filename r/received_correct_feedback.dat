40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{explored the}} issue of whether enhanced metamnemonic knowledge at retrieval can improve participants ’ ability to make difficult source discriminations {{in the context of the}} eyewitness suggestibility paradigm. The 1 st experiment documented differences in phenomenal experience between veridical and false memories. Experiment 2 revealed that drawing participants ’ attention to these differences by pairing the ratings of the features with instructions about their utility was successful in reducing source misattributions of suggested items to the event. The results of Experiment 3 showed that participants can make online adjustments in the types of evidence used to make source judgments, as participants who <b>received</b> <b>correct</b> <b>feedback</b> during the training portion of the test reduced misattribution errors on the remainder of the test where feedback was not provided. Altogether, these studies suggest that people can discover and benefit from updated knowledge of the types of memorial evidence that discriminate between sources of information in memory...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{examined}} {{the role of}} action effects (i. e., ball trajectory) during {{the performance of a}} soccer kick. Participants were 20 expert players who kicked a ball over a height barrier toward a ground-level target. The authors occluded participants' vision of the ball trajectory after foot-to-ball contact. Participants in a 1 st group received erroneous feedback from a video that showed a ball-trajectory apex approximately 75 cm lower than that of their actual kick, although the ball's landing position was unaltered. Participants in a 2 nd group <b>received</b> <b>correct</b> video <b>feedback</b> of both the ball trajectory and the landing position. The erroneous-feedback group showed a significant bias toward higher ball trajectories than did the correct-feedback group. The authors conclude that performers at high levels of skill use the visual consequences of the action to plan and execute an action...|$|R
40|$|The multi-armed bandit problem {{forms the}} {{foundation}} for solving {{a wide range of}} on-line stochastic optimization problems through a simple, yet effective mechanism. One simply casts the problem as a gambler that repeatedly pulls one out of N slot machine arms, eliciting random rewards. Learning of reward probabilities is then combined with reward maximization, by carefully balancing reward exploration against reward exploitation. In this paper, we address a particularly intriguing variant of the multi-armed bandit problem, referred to as the Stochastic Point Location (SPL) Problem. The gambler is here only told whether the optimal arm (point) lies to the "left" or to the "right" of the arm pulled, with the feedback being erroneous with probability 1 -π. This formulation thus captures optimization in continuous action spaces with both informative and deceptive feedback. To tackle this class of problems, we formulate a compact and scalable Bayesian representation of the solution space that simultaneously captures both the location of the optimal arm as well as the probability of <b>receiving</b> <b>correct</b> <b>feedback.</b> We further introduce the accompanying Thompson Sampling guided Stochastic Point Location (TS-SPL) scheme for balancing exploration against exploitation. By learning π, TS-SPL also supports deceptive environments that are lying about the direction of the optimal arm. This, in turn, allows us to solve the fundamental Stochastic Root Finding (SRF) Problem. Empirical results demonstrate that our scheme deals with both deceptive and informative environments, significantly outperforming competing algorithms both for SRF and SPL.

40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the types of}} feedbacks made by EFL students in a writing class. A number of 25 students essays were collected and analysed. The results revealed {{that a number of}} 61 responding feedbacks were found in the types of support, sharing knowledge, negotiation, appreciation and criticism. Meanwhile, 142 <b>correcting</b> <b>feedbacks</b> were found in the types of coded, uncoded, a combination of coded and uncoded and direct answer. The type most used in responding feedback was support, which indicates that it is an important pursuit in these students learning to drive each other into improving their writing skills with confidence. Whilst the least used was criticism, and this indicates that it was not considerably favoured to be given in the peer correction feedbacks since they restrain encouragement and cause social anxiety. The type most used in <b>correcting</b> <b>feedbacks</b> was a combination of coded and uncoded. This signifies that to provide both mark and symbol on an error can avoid confusion between the student corrector and the student writer.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{variations}} in signal probability and {{varying degrees of}} <b>correct</b> <b>feedback</b> on response bias were studied in a yes-no auditory signal detection task. The main finding was that the bias towards saying yes was an increasing function of the frequency of signal feedback events, but did {{not depend on the}} correctness of the feedback. Several learning models coupled with a simple psychophysical and decision model yielded predictions about overall biases and certain sequential statistics. Only one model, which can be described as an "informational " model, gave a good account of both observed overall biases and sequential statistics. This model assumes the observer's response bias is strengthened for the feedback-reinforced response when the observer's sensory information is ambiguous or is contradicted by the feedback information. This report presents an empirical and theoretical analysis of the effects of informational feedback variables and signal-presentation probabilities on response bias in a yes-no auditory detection task. The general approach is similar to that employed by Atkinson and Kinchla (1965) for forced-choice tasks, though we use a broader range of informational variables and theoretical models.

40|$|The {{congestion}} control algorithm of TCP relies on <b>correct</b> <b>feedback</b> from {{the receiver to}} determine {{the rate at which}} packets should be sent into the network. Hence, <b>correct</b> receiver <b>feedback</b> (in the form of TCP acknowledgements) is essential to the goal of sharing the scarce bandwidth resources fairly and avoiding congestion collapse in the Internet. However, the assumption that a TCP receiver can always be trusted (to generate feedback correctly) no longer holds as there are plenty of incentives for a receiver to deviate from the protocol. In fact, {{it has been shown that}} a misbehaving receiver (whose aim is to bring about congestion collapse) can easily generate acknowledgements to conceal packet loss, so as to drive a number of honest, innocent senders arbitrarily fast to create a significant number of non-responsive packet flows, leading to denial of service to other Internet users. We give the first formal treatment to this problem. We also give an efficient, provably secure mechanism to force a receiver to generate feedback correctly; any incorrect acknowledgement will be detected at the sender and cheating TCP receivers would be identified. The idea is as follows: for each packet sent, the sender generates a tag using a secret key (known to himself only); the receiver could generate a proof using the packet and the tag alone, and send it to the sender; the sender can then verify the proof using the secret key; an incorrect proof would indicate a cheating receiver. The scheme is very efficient in the sense that the TCP sender does not need to store the packet or the tag, and the proofs for multiple packets can be aggregated at the receiver. The scheme is based on an aggregate authenticator. In addition, the proposed solution can be applied to network-layer rate-limiting architectures requiring <b>correct</b> <b>feedback...</b>|$|R
