5|$|Improvements in Norfolk's <b>road</b> <b>infrastructure</b> and the {{development}} of the stagecoach system made Norwich an increasingly popular destination with travellers. Norwich was recovering from the plague years and was a major city, with attractions and social events second only to London itself. The increasingly prosperous country landowners of Norfolk and Suffolk began visiting Norwich more frequently and staying for longer when they did so.|$|E
5|$|Electric trams were {{a common}} sight in early 20th century Salford, and had from 1901 {{replaced}} the earlier horse-drawn vehicles. A network of lines crossed the region, with coordinated services running through Salford, Manchester and the surrounding areas. Many served the new suburban housing and industrial developments built at the time, but in 1947 they were withdrawn in favour of more practical services– buses. The city is served by a complex <b>road</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> with connections from the M602 motorway to several major motorways, and A-roads including the A57 Regent Road and the A6042 Trinity Way. Salford City Council has also created both advisory and mandatory cycle lanes across the city.|$|E
5|$|Oslo Package 3 is a {{political}} agreement between all the major projects on what to spend public funding for transport in Oslo and Akershus on. The agreement was made in 2007, and consists of 53 billion Norwegian krone (NOK), which will be shared between investments in <b>road</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> public transport infrastructure, and operating subsidies for Ruter. Financing comes from the state, the counties and from toll roads. The agreement states the major investments which are planned during a 20-year period. In addition, the previous agreement, Oslo Package 2, still has funding for some smaller projects.|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{a series of}} novelties with respect to previous studies {{of the effect of}} productive infrastructures on output growth. We study public investment in <b>road</b> <b>infrastructures</b> as a determinant of the total factor productivity (TFP) growth for Spanish provinces (NUTS 3) for the period 1984 - 1994. We allow the effect of <b>road</b> <b>infrastructures</b> to depend on the extent of the road use by provincial industries, proxied by these industries' vehicle intensity. Moreover, we consider the services provided by the stock of <b>road</b> <b>infrastructures</b> as an impure public good, that is, one that is subject to congestion. Finally, using the instrumental variables technique, we account for possible problems of endogeneity in the regressions. Copyright (c) 2008 the author(s). Journal compilation (c) 2008 RSAI. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{civil parish}} councils were governed by Ely Rural District council from 1894 until 1974. East Cambridgeshire District Council (ECDC) {{was formed in}} 1974 with {{administration}} buildings in Ely. The district council collects council tax, provides services such as building regulations and local planning, leisure and tourism, handles issues strategic to the district, and many other services. ECDC is in turn governed by Cambridgeshire County Council which has administration buildings in Cambridge. The county council provides county-wide services such as major <b>road</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> fire and rescue, libraries and heritage, and strategic planning. A mobile library visits the village every fortnight.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} sees Taunton's {{traffic congestion}} problems {{as a serious}} obstacle to its continuing economic growth. An {{important part of the}} government's growth strategy for the town is new <b>road</b> <b>infrastructure</b> consisting of a new link road (Taunton's Third Way) which was completed 27 September 2011 at a cost of £7.5 million. A second link road, (the Northern Inner Distributor Road) planned for completion by the end of 2014 at a cost of £21 million, is still unfinished in 2016, with no completion in the near future. The road would link Staplegrove Road with Priory Avenue, running across Station Road.|$|E
5|$|The {{rebuilding}} of Bristol city centre was characterised by 1960s and 1970s skyscrapers, mid-century modern architecture and road improvements. Beginning in the 1980s some main roads were closed, the Georgian-era Queen Square and Portland Square were restored, the Broadmead shopping area regenerated, {{and one of}} the city centre's tallest mid-century towers was demolished. Bristol's <b>road</b> <b>infrastructure</b> changed dramatically during the 1960s and 1970s with the development of the M4 and M5 motorways, which meet at the Almondsbury Interchange just north of the city and link Bristol with London (M4 eastbound), Swansea (M4 westbound across the Severn Estuary), Exeter (M5 southbound) and Birmingham (M5 northbound).|$|E

An analysis has begun by taking a detailed picture of the territory covering at least the following items: orography and slopes, road networks, land cover and use, human settlements, and tourist sites.

5|$|By the 1940s the lessee at Muckaty was Fred Ulyatt. The 1940s also {{marked a}} {{significant}} change in the region's <b>road</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> A dirt track had been formed to service the telegraph line in the late nineteenth century. This became the Stuart Highway, crossing the eastern part of Muckaty, and it was upgraded to an all-weather road in late 1940, before being bitumenised in 1944. Sources do not say who leased the property between the 1940s and 1982, at which point the lease was held by James and Miriam Hagan. In 1988 it was transferred to Hapford Pty Limited and Kerfield Pty Limited. Between 1985 and 1987 a natural gas pipeline was built across the station, carrying gas from Palm Valley in the Amadeus Basin to Channel Island near Darwin.|$|E
5|$|Like much of British post-war development, the {{regeneration}} of Bristol {{city centre}} was characterised by Mid-Century Modern towers such as Castlemead, Modernist architecture, and improvement and expansion to <b>road</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The world's oldest shot tower in Redcliffe {{was lost to}} road development in 1968, being replaced the following year by the Cheese Lane Shot Tower on a different site. Since the 1990s this trend has been reversing, limiting access with the closure {{of a number of}} main roads, whilst the Broadmead shopping centre has been further developed. In 2006, one of the city centre's tallest Mid-Century Modern towers was lost, with further historic 20th century structures being destroyed more recently. The transfer of the docks to Avonmouth, 7miles(11km) downstream from the city centre, relieved congestion in the centre of Bristol and allowed substantial redevelopment of the old central dock area (the Floating Harbour). The continued existence of the central docks was for some time in jeopardy, as they were seen to be remnants of a derelict industry instead of an asset to be developed for public use.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} years, the {{attention}} to environmental issue is growing, demonstrating the interest to protect the nature and to better use the non-renewable resources. At international level, {{and especially in the}} European Community, for different trades, a wide production of voluntary documents and institutional acts proves the interest and the need for a green economy. An innovative approach may lead to the experience of Green Public Procurements (GPP), to protect the environment as a public interest and to promote technological developments. So far, the experiences of GPP are limited, not entirely positive and in the field of <b>road</b> <b>infrastructures</b> almost entirely absent. Construction and maintenance of <b>road</b> <b>infrastructures</b> is objectively more complex than purchasing goods or services. The paper proposes the integration of the weighted sum multi-criteria analysis into existing procedures. The methodology needs for environmental labels related to materials, machines and works which contribute to the final product "road". The labels are recognized at international level and consistent with procedures, conditions and criteria currently published in road tenders, therefore the approach can be followed to pursue the environmental sustainability of <b>road</b> <b>infrastructures</b> without compromising the economic attention...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} traffic flows on <b>road</b> <b>infrastructures</b> significantly quicken {{the degradation}} {{time of the}} pavements efficiency characteristics. As a consequence, the managing bodies are obliged to consider more frequent maintenance interventions, {{so as to guarantee}} high levels of both safety and comfort for users. Therefore, considering the wide extension of the Italian <b>road</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> one could easily imagine the large amount of milled materials (R. A. P.) coming from maintenance. Along with R. A. P., there is another waste material which is to be considered also: it is the so-called C&D, which basically belongs from the demolition of civil engineering structures. Both materials involve serious environmental considerations, the need of new landfills being compulsory. The re-use of these substances is the solution to this concern, and this reflects the current trend of finding alternative technologies for the use of waste materials. Actually, waste materials recycling, including R. A. P. and C&D {{is one of the most}} interesting technical innovations, both the economical and environmental aspects being considered at the same time. For this reason, this paper proposes the outcomes of an optimisation study on R. A. P. and R. A. P. + C&D mixes for the manufacture of cement admixtures for <b>road</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> based on mechanical and economical evaluations...|$|R

While a reasonable <b>road</b> <b>infrastructure</b> has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must {{be paid to the}} presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road.
