While a revolution produces progress, a reaction does not.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} element in nation-building, {{the story of the}} heroic past, fell to such nationalist German historians as the liberal constitutionalist Friedrich Dahlmann (1785–1860), his conservative student Heinrich von Treitschke (1834–1896), and others less conservative, such as Theodor Mommsen (1817–1903) and Heinrich von Sybel (1817–1895), to name two. Dahlmann himself died before unification, but he laid the groundwork for the nationalist histories to come through his histories of the English and French <b>revolutions,</b> by casting these <b>revolutions</b> as fundamental to the construction of a nation, and Dahlmann himself viewed Prussia as the logical agent of unification.|$|E

5000|$|You don't have a {{peaceful}} <b>revolution.</b> You don't have a turn-the-other-cheek <b>revolution.</b> There's {{no such thing}} as a nonviolent <b>revolution.</b> The only kind of <b>revolution</b> that's nonviolent is the Negro <b>revolution.</b> The only <b>revolution</b> based on loving your enemy is the Negro <b>revolution.</b> ... <b>Revolution</b> is bloody, <b>revolution</b> is hostile, <b>revolution</b> knows no compromise, <b>revolution</b> overturns and destroys everything that gets in its way. And you, sitting around here like a knot on the wall, saying, [...] "I'm going to love these folks no matter how much they hate me." [...] No, you need a <b>revolution.</b> Whoever heard of a <b>revolution</b> where they lock arms, singing [...] "We Shall Overcome"? You don't do that in a <b>revolution.</b> You don't do any singing, you're too busy swinging. It's based on land. A revolutionary wants land so he can set up his own nation, an independent nation. These Negroes aren't asking for any nation—they're trying to crawl back on the plantation.|$|R

5|$|The 1940s saw various <b>revolutions</b> and coups d'état in Latin America {{including}} the ousting of Argentine President Ramón Castillo in 1943. Berni responded with more political paintings including Masacre (Massacre) and El Obrero Muerto (The Dead Worker).|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} {{factions of}} the sejm were divided between liberals, supporting the German constitutional movement, and conservatives, like Edward Raczyński, who predicted that this movement would abolish the Grand Duchy's autonomy. During {{the two or}} so decades of its existence, the major issues of concern of the Sejm were the abolition of serfdom and relations between the inhabitants of Polish and German ethnicity, particularly the discrimination against the Poles by the Prussian government, which increasingly excluded the Polish majority from administration and judiciary. The last petition issued by the Sejm in 1841 demanded equal rights for the Poles and stopping of the Germanization campaign. As most of the Sejm petitions were simply ignored by the King of Prussia, this contributed to dissent in the province, which eventually resulted in an uprising in 1848 {{in the midst of}} the <b>revolutions</b> of 1848 in the German states. The Sejm met the total of seven times before the <b>revolutions</b> of 1848 (in 1827, 1830, 1834, 1837, 1841, 1843 and 1845). Following the <b>revolutions,</b> the Sejm of the Grand Duchy, like other provincial Prussian assemblies, gained the right to elect deputies to the Prussian Parliament. The Sejm continued its sessions till 1918, with a total of 49 Sejms being held.|$|E

5|$|Aurobindo was {{influenced}} by studies on rebellion and <b>revolutions</b> against England in medieval France and the revolts in America and Italy.

5000|$|Lenin {{attempted}} {{and failed}} to bring about communist <b>revolution</b> in Russia in the Russian <b>Revolution</b> of 1905-7. During the <b>revolution,</b> Lenin advocated mass action and that the <b>revolution</b> [...] "accept mass terror in its tactics". During the <b>revolution</b> Lenin advocated militancy and violence of workers {{as a means to}} pressure the middle class to join and overthrow the Tsar. Bolshevik emigres briefly poured into Russia {{to take part in the}} <b>revolution.</b> Prior and after the failed <b>revolution,</b> the Bolshevik leadership voluntarily resided in exile to evade Tsarist Russia's secret police, such as Lenin who resided in Switzerland. Most importantly, the experience of this <b>revolution</b> caused Lenin to conceive of the means of sponsoring communist <b>revolution,</b> through propaganda, agitation, a well-organised and disciplined but small political party.|$|R

5|$|Every {{city in the}} {{territory}} of modern Argentina other than Córdoba endorsed the Primera Junta. The cities of the Upper Peru, however, did not take a position, owing to the recent outcomes of the Chuquisaca and La Paz <b>Revolutions.</b> Asunción del Paraguay rejected the Junta and swore loyalty to the Council of Regency. The Banda Oriental, under Francisco Javier de Elío, remained a royalist stronghold.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{crushing}} {{of the two}} <b>revolutions,</b> a number of Brabant and Liège revolutionaries regrouped in Paris, where they formed the joint Committee of United Belgians and Liégois (Comité des belges et liégeois unis), which united revolutionaries from both territories for the first time. Three Belgian corps and a Liège Legion were levied to continue the fight for the French against the Austrians.|$|E

5|$|In {{subsequent}} decades, republicanism would regain {{lost ground}} {{with the rise of}} liberalism, nationalism, and later socialism. The <b>Revolutions</b> of 1848 were largely inspired by republicanism. Most of Europe's monarchies were abolished either during or following World War I or World War II, and the remaining monarchies were transformed into constitutional monarchies.|$|E
5|$|In the Springtime of the Peoples {{during the}} <b>Revolutions</b> of 1848, revolutionaries {{took to the}} streets, many flying the tricolour. Liberals took power and, after {{prolonged}} deliberation, a national assembly was formulated. This Frankfurt Parliament declared the black-red-gold as the official colours of Germany and passed a law stating its civil ensign was the black-red-yellow tricolour. Also, a naval war ensign used these colours.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{leading up to}} 1789, the {{territory}} today known as Belgium was divided into two states, called the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège, both of which were part of the Holy Roman Empire. In the aftermath of the French Revolution, both states experienced <b>revolutions</b> in 1789 in which the old order was overthrown and new states created. These <b>revolutions</b> were condemned by the Holy Roman Empire and were crushed by 1792. The territory was only briefly regained, however, as the area was captured by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars and incorporated into the French First Republic. This French period lasted roughly from 1794 to 1815. In the aftermath of Napoleon's final defeat in 1815, the Congress of Vienna added the territory of Belgium to the Netherlands, and until 1830, Belgium was part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands.|$|E
