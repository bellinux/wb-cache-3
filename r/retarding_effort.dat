40|$|The moral and/or {{juridical}} {{arguments for}} abolishing {{the death penalty}} as it now stands succeed to some degree because the moral and/or juridical arguments {{for the death penalty}} are weak. Such arguments only have to show that the currently cited grounds for upholding the death penalty fail to meet the rationales and criteria that their adherents advance. However, arguments for or against the death penalty appeal to moral principles which are not neutral with regard to metaphysical issues; moral assertions come with ontological and epistemic commitments. No argument about equity or fairness or justice can be made without premises which express what kinds of things there are, what one can be said to know, and what an agent is free to do. This paper explores a different approach to the merits of the death penalty based on Leibniz's metaphysical principles: monads' phenomenal expression, pre-established harmony, super-essentialism, individuals' inner programs, and moral agents' freedom to act like "little gods". This paper presents Leibniz's picture of an individual who freely chooses to contribute to the moral pessimum (the worst compossible state-of-affairs) and the compensatory scheme that requires an effort by a community of rational agents to redress the overall balance of moral good. On this view, there is a positive requirement for the benefit of a community of minds to invoke the death penalty for a murderer whose individual concept contributes to the pessimum, and whose continued life <b>retards</b> <b>efforts</b> to achieve an optimum state where moral good outweighs moral evil...|$|R
40|$|Development aid {{in most of}} the {{developing}} countries can sometimes compromise the principles of public service broadcasting (PSB). This may be true when reflected against the tension between donor financed programmes in Malawi and the mandate of Television Malawi (TVM). Although the donor intentions are noble, the strings attached to the funding are sometimes retrogressive to the role of PSBs. A case in point is how donors dictate terms on the HIV/Aids communication strategies at TVM. Producers receive money from donors with strings attached on how the money should be used and accounted for. If producers deviate they are sanctioned through withholding funding, shifting schedules and reducing the funding frequency. The donors also dictate who to interview on what subject, how to conduct capacity building. Some scholars have researched much on the impact of commercialisation of the media. This study is a departure from these traditional interferences; it interrogates the interest of philanthropy tendencies by international donors in the three chosen HIV/Aids programmes broadcast by TVM. The study investigates the extent of pressure exerted by donors on the producers of HIV/Aids programmes in Malawi. Thus, the study seeks to illicit specifics in the power relationship between the donor and the producer hence the study employs the political economy of development aid as applied to the public service broadcasting and communication for development. The study employed qualitative research methods and techniques (in-depth interviews, case study and document analysis). The study reveals how donor ideologies dominate the Aids messages-content output of the texts constructed. The study argues that cultural alienation of the Malawian audiences <b>retards</b> <b>efforts</b> of donors in combating HIV infection rate. ...|$|R

The collapse of the Soviet Union created new complications in {{a long tradition of}} nonproliferation cooperation between the United States and Russia, and Iran is just one example. In the 1960 s, faced with a common nuclear threat of China, Washington and Moscow united to negotiate the Limited Test Ban Treaty and Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to prevent China and other nuclear aspirants from proliferating nuclear weapons.

Following the Cold War their cooperative relationship changed as Washington began treating Moscow as an unequal partner and their nonproliferation efforts broke down into a cooperative and uncooperative mix.

This study showed that in 1949, 89 percent of the farmers in the area surveyed had not yet reduced their soil losses to the annual rate of 5 tons per acre or less which is considered the maximum that will maintain soil productivity and prevent gullying. Furthermore, farm operators on the average were following only one or two erosion control practices which, would directly help in reducing soil erosion, although as many as six or seven different practices were recommended per farm. Farmers were more reluctant to adopt terraces and high-forage rotations than other practices. Also, to comply with current erosion control recommendations it was estimated that the present acreage of row crops in the area should be reduced 41 percent, while the acreage of hay and meadow should be increased 54 percent...|$|R

Mussolini believed that conquering Ethiopia would cost 4 to 6 billion lire, but the true costs of the invasion proved to be 33.5 billion lire. The economic costs of the conquest {{proved to be a}} staggering blow to the Italian budget, and seriously <b>retarded</b> Italian <b>efforts</b> at military modernization as the money that Mussolini had earmarked for military modernization was instead spent in conquering Ethiopia, something that helped to drive Mussolini towards Germany. To help cover the huge debts run up during the Ethiopian war, Mussolini devalued the lire by 40% in October 1936. Furthermore, the costs of occupying Ethiopia was to cost the Italian treasury another 21.1 billion lire between 1936–1940. Additionally, Italy was to lose 4,000 men killed fighting in the Spanish Civil War (a number adjusted to Italy's population was proportionally twice the American losses in Vietnam) while Italian intervention in Spain cost Italy another 12 to 14 billion lire. In the years 1938 and 1939, the Italian government took in 39.9 billion lire in taxes while the entire Italian gross national product was 153 billion lire, which meant the Ethiopian and Spanish wars imposed economically crippling costs on Italy. Only 28% of the entire military Italian budgets between 1934–39 was spent on military modernization with the rest all being consumed by Mussolini's wars, which led to a rapid decline in Italian military power. By contrast, reflecting the far larger size of the German economy, the total Italian military expenditure in 1936 was equal to only 27% of the total German military expenditure for 1936. The much greater size of the German economy allowed Hitler to both modernize the Wehrmacht and intervene in the Spanish Civil War at the same time, an option that Mussolini did not have. Between 1935–39, Mussolini's wars cost Italy the equivalent of $500 US billion dollars in 1999 values, a sum that was even proportionally a larger burden given that Italy was such a poor country. The 1930s were a time of rapid advances in military technology, and Sullivan wrote that Mussolini picked exactly the wrong time to fight his wars in Ethiopia and Spain. At {{the same time that the}} Italian military was falling behind the other great powers, a full scale arms race had broken out, with Germany, Britain and France spending increasingly large sums of money on their militaries as the 1930s advanced, a situation that Mussolini privately admitted seriously limited Italy's ability to fight a major war on its own, and thus required a great power ally to compensate for increasing Italian military backwardness.|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{happening}} {{and will continue}} to be the real challenge for mankind survival and sustainable development. The impacts associated with climate change are already experienced in many systems and sectors essential for human livelihood in the most vulnerable communities. On the other hand, the impacts of climate change pose a direct threat to people‘s survival and different ecosystems, particularly in developing countries. It is expected that the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events will increase causing severe socio-economic consequences particularly to the least developing countries due to low adaptive capacity. In Tanzania, we have witnessed incidences of severe and recurrent droughts hitting many parts of our country leading to food insecurity, massive deaths of livestock, dwindling of water resources and destruction of human settlements and infrastructure due to floods. All of these had consequences to communities <b>retarding</b> their <b>efforts</b> to alleviate poverty. Farming communities are among the vulnerable groups that have been suffering seriously as a result of climate change due to the fact that their activities are climate sensitive. In this regard, adaptation to the impacts of climate change is absolutely important in order to enable the farming communities to cope with the changing climate. Appropriate adaptation measures are important in strengthening the resilience of these communities in their local setting. For this to be effective, it is therefore imperative that communities are assisted with information that will enable them to understand climate change, its associated impacts and measures which can be employed in addressing the impacts of climate change through participatory climate change adaptation planning approach. Cognizant of the fact that information on climate change is of paramount importance in assisting farmers to plan for adaptation actions, the Vice President’s Office in consultation with stakeholders prepared this climate change adaptation information toolkit for farming communities in Tanzania. The toolkit is the first resource to the farming communities for the purpose of learning about what climate change is, what are the expected impacts to farming communities, and more importantly, it provides some preliminary ideas on options for adaptation that farming communities can apply to start dealing with the threats of climate change. It is a starting point for developing targeted information and resource materials to farming communities. Generally, this toolkit provides basic understanding on climate change, how it affects farming communities and equips them with ideas or tools to address climate change impacts. It is designed in the form of a resource book that will be made available directly to local farming communities, Extension Officers as well as other experts. It is my sincere hope that you will find this Toolkit useful to guide adaptation awareness, planning, management and implementation of climate change adaptation measures for the farming communities. I urge you to use this Toolkit in undertaking planning, management and implementation of climate change adaptation actions, as it will contribute towards improving people’s livelihood and sustainable development in the country.

40|$|The Central Asian Orogenic Belt (CAOB), {{also known}} as Altaids, is the largest and {{probably}} the least understood accretionary orogenic belt in the world. Chinese Altai, as one of typical regions of the CAOB, formed {{in response to the}} consumption of the Altay Ocean. The Chinese Altai is characterized by huge amount of granitoids, which cover about 40 % exposed rock area in this region. However, lack of reliable ages for major strata and tectonothermal events has greatly <b>retarded</b> the <b>effort</b> for tectonic reconstruction of this area. The Habahe Group and Altai Formation, among others, are most debatable about their ages. Zircon U-Pb dating by SHRIMP and LA-ICP-MS for representative granitic intrusions in Chinese Altai have been conducted, in order to reveal the main geological framework and tectonothermal events of this area. Six granitic plutons have been investigated along two geo-traverses, which are perpendicular and parallel to the strike of the Altai orogen, respectively. Of these plutons, South Friendship Peak two-mica granite (SFP), Tielieketi biotite granite (TBG) and West Keketuohai granodiorite (WKG) intruded the Habahe Group, while the Habahe quartzdiorite (HG), Ashile granodiorite (AG) and Tarlang Intrusive Complex (TIC) intruded the Altai Formation. The SEP, TBG and WKG were dated to be 393 ± 7 Ma, 410 ± 6 Ma and 466 ± 12 Ma, respectively. In addition, the SEP and TBG contain Cambrian (528 ± 14 Ma) and late Archean (ca. 2. 5 Ga) zircon grains that probably came from the Habahe Group. These ages well constrain the timing of the Habahe Group deposition to be pre-Mid Ordovician to Early Cambrian (466 - 528 Ma). Of the plutons intruding the Altai Formation, the HG and AG were dated to be 389 ± 5 Ma and 318 ± 6 Ma, respectively, while the TIC consists of multiple magma pulses with ages mainly between 382 ± 5 Ma and 412 ± 6 Ma. The latest pulse of the TIC was dated to be 357 ± 7 Ma and contains both 469 ± 12 Ma and Precambrian zircon xenocrysts captured probably from the Altai Formation. These results indicate that the Altai Formation was deposited most likely in between Late Silurian and Mid Ordovician (412 - 469 Ma), rather than in the Devonian or Paleoproterozoic as previously assumed. Moreover, there are 295 to 297 Ma zircon grains in the latest pulse of TIC, which is interpreted to reflect the gneissic to mylonitic deformation in the Early Permian. The above data suggest that the Devonian is a very important era for the emplacement of granitic intrusions in Chinese Altai. The erosion of the early Paleozoic intrusions and the consequent deposition of detrital materials are consistent with a Paleozoic southwestward accretionary continental margin.

40|$|This project {{explores the}} role of {{storytelling}} by individuals in times of organizational change. The study {{was carried out in}} a local body organization that, like other local body bodies in New Zealand, had been undergoing a series of changes {{over a period of several}} years as the result of central government reform. There is a wide body of literature supporting the theory that the performance of stories is a key part of an organization's members' sensemaking. It has been shown that people reconstruct and interpret different experiences of organizational change and learning. For this study a total of 21 employees from the local body were interviewed by way of storytelling. The main research question asked: "what do stories told by employees in an organization undergoing change indicate about the change?" Closely related sub-questions asked if stories indicated resistance or commitment to the changes, or degrees of resistance and/or commitment. Resistance to change is recognised as a critically important factor that can influence the success or otherwise of an organizational change. This resistance can be an impediment to progress. In times of organizational change, stories told by employees may indicate resistance to the change which, if not adequately addressed, may <b>retard</b> organizational change <b>efforts.</b> The major findings from the employees' stories revealed some important key themes. They were that the participants had conflicting views of what the purpose of the current changes were. In addition, there was a general sense of, "here we go again", following on from previous changes in the organization. This perception gave the effect that participants had difficulty in viewing the current changes seriously. There was also a general perception that the right people were not being included in the change- making decision process. People felt left out and therefore expressed resistance in their stories. Further, a special group of people was selected from within the organization to carry out the change process and they too indicated feelings of isolation from and rejection by the organization's employees, and that created for them feelings of resistance. Overall, it seemed clear the stories provided confirmed that participants resisted the change to varying degrees. Thornhill, Lewis and Millmore. (2000) states perceptions about change will affect its acceptance and may lead to resistance that could effectively minimise or even negate the purpose of the intended change. The analysis of these stories provided implications for change managers. This study has shown that the individuals' narratives orstories are a powerful vehicle and source of knowledge of how employees view happenings within the organization. A positive lesson to be learned from this research, and one which can be utilised by change managers in the future, is the significance of employees' stories and their importance to managers to listen to, gauge and assess the mood of the organization toward change. A second round of interviews with a small group of the original interviewees, one year on, served the purpose of giving the participants an opportunity to reflect on the events and for sensemaking of what they didn't necessarily understand or were not aware of at the time of the first round. This proved to be a valuable opportunity to consider, reflect and learn for future organizational change processes. It is suggested that it would be useful to conduct similar research within other local bodies that have also been undergoing series of changes over recent years following central government reform. Because of the uniqueness of local bodies and their position seated between public service organizations and the private sector, they are in a position where they are pressured to satisfy the demands of the stakeholders, both the community and the ratepayer-elected body of councillors. No doubt councils are continuing to investigate the most appropriate local government structures to meet their stakeholder's needs and the delivery of services.
