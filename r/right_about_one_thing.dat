He quizzes Chas on her blaming herself for Aaron being messed up, suggesting she believes Aaron to alleviate her own guilt, but Chas hits back that the abuse has made her feel even more guilty for not protecting her son. The defence brings up Chas' PTSD and Aaron leaving for Ireland when she needed him most. Later, Aaron reassures Chas she did great but Chas apologizes. Aaron admits to Chas, Gordon's barrister was <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing,</b> he doesn't want Gordon's name - so he is going to change it to Dingle. 2 days later, Gordon is found guilty of rape by the jury.|$|E

Ondina herself only had twelve shells left, four of which she fired at the Hokoku Maru, the rest at Aikoku Maru, apparently without scoring a hit. A last attempt to escape by dumping smokebuoys overboard was unsuccessful, and the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship to avoid further bloodshed. The engines were stopped, the lifeboats lowered and a white flag was hoisted, all under continuous fire from the Aikoku Maru. A few moments later, Captain Horsman was killed by a piece of shrapnel from a shell hitting the bridge. Two lifeboats and two rafts were lowered into the water and later, another lifeboat was in the water with the remainder of the crew. Most of the crew (with the exception of officers and guncrew) were Chinese, and they had been troublesome during the whole action, refusing any assistance that might help save the ship.|$|E
40|$|Last {{week in the}} Australian, Janet Albrechtsen {{argued that}} {{overseas}} experience demonstrated that adopting a Bill of Rights for Australia was unwise. Simon Evans responds to the errors in her analysis of the overseas experience. JANET ALBRECHTSEN is <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> Just about the worst argument for an Australian Bill of Rights is that every other Western democracy has one. But she misunderstands some key points about how modern Bills of Rights, like the British Human Rights Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights, actually work. As a result, her jeremiad against an Australian Bill of Rights is built on shaky foundations. An Australian Bill of Rights {{might not be a}} good idea, but not for the reasons that Albrechtsen gives. Old-fashioned Bills of Rights, like the United States Bill, give the final say about rights to the courts. If the Supreme Court says that a law or some government action violates the Bill of Rights then that’s the end of the story. The law or government action is invalid. There’s nothing Congress can do except try to amend the Constitution. Modern Bills of Rights are different. Their framers have learnt the lessons of the United States experience. As Albrechtsen points out, when interpreting the Bill of Rights, US judges make policy decisions that should properly be made in congress. Not only do they make policy decisions, they get the final word. In Canada and the UK, the courts don’t get the final word. The Canadian Charter of Rights has a specific mechanism that allows parliament to legislate ‘notwithstanding’ the rights contained in the Charter. The Canadian courts can strike down laws that in their view are inconsistent with the charter. But parliament can respond and take a different view what the rights contained in the Charter mean or what limits need to be placed on them in a democractic society. In the UK, the courts can’t even strike down laws that in their view are inconsistent with the Human Rights Act. They can declare that in their view that laws are inconsistent with the act. But that doesn’t affect the validity or operation of the law. In both countries, the courts will try to interpret laws so that they are consistent with human rights. Our own courts do that already. Sometimes that means that courts interpret laws more narrowly than governments may wish. But in Canada and the UK, just as in Australia, governments have the means to respond if they disagree. They can say to the courts that their interpretation of what human rights require is wrong. Or they can amend their laws to respond to some of the criticisms made by the courts. That’s what’s happening in the UK at the moment in relation to deportation of ‘preachers of hate’, although Tony Blair does seem to want to wind back the Human Rights Act rather than legislate within its framework. Equally, Canadian legislatures may respond to the private health insurance ruling by reinstating the existing system or (more likely and perhaps better policy) improving it in light of the problems brought out by the Supreme Court’s ruling. It might be convenient for politicians to describe this as a battle for supremacy with the courts. But it’s nothing of the sort. It’s the natural operation of a system, fundamentally different from the United States system, in which parliaments and courts have distinct and complementary contributions to make in relation to rights. Parliaments have democratic legitimacy and policy making expertise. But they can’t predict the future and every possible ramification of the laws they enact. Courts look backwards and see how laws have affected the human rights of particular individuals. This dynamic relationship between parliaments and courts in the UK and Canadian models - sometimes but controversially described as a dialogue - draws on the strengths of both institutions to protect human rights, enhancing and not undermining democracy. If any more Australian jurisdictions do adopt Bills of Rights, it is almost inevitable that they will follow the UK or perhaps the Canadian model. They will not give Australian courts the unbridled power or the direct political role of the United States courts. Parliaments will retain the final say. They will continue the existing practice of Australian courts in interpreting laws consistently with human rights. But they will give them an explicit and democratically established framework for doing so. And they will provide a framework for parliaments and courts together to develop an understanding of what human rights require in the Australian context. • Simon Evans is Director of the Centre for Comparative Constitutional Studies at the University of Melbourne Photo: Mark Hurlburt/ iStockphoto. co...|$|E
40|$|Suddenly the "blame game" is a live issue, argues David Burchell FOR DAYS {{commentators}} have been digging over the auguries of the NSW election, {{looking for clues}} to the federal poll later in the year. Yet in one respect the NSW election simply tells us something we already knew: that the NSW Liberal Party is an inadequate vehicle for the winning of elections. It’s an enduring mystery how the same state Liberal Party that runs election campaigns like this one can produce federal ministers of the calibre of John Howard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull. Maybe there’s a Darwinian explanation: if you can survive the NSW Liberal Party and thrive as a politician, {{you must be a}} particularly well-adapted specimen of the species homo politicus. As it has for many years, the electoral map of Sydney - at the state level, at least - continues to resemble a map of two rival principalities. Twelve of the fourteen Liberal electorates in the city lie north of the harbour and the Parramatta River. Pretty much the entirety of the city’s west, south, south east and inner city lie in Labor hands. The Liberal Party’s notorious Sydney Problem remains, much as it did ten or even twenty years ago. And they seem no closer to cracking it. However, this leads me to the second lesson to be learned out of the NSW election - and it’s less obvious and familiar than the first. For - at least until this election- the federal Coalition could have boasted fairly enough to have cracked the Sydney Problem at the national level. The last decade has seen the entrenchment of a division in many voters’ minds between the political and social responsibilities of state and federal jurisdictions. Ordinary voters in the outer suburbs of our major cities still see themselves as Labor-aligned on health, welfare and service issues - all the key areas of state responsibility. But over the long economic and housing boom over the last decade, and especially since the jihadist spectre emerged in 2001, many of the same people have come to see themselves as mildly conservative on economic and national security issues. This is why the service-deprived but house-proud and striving citizens of Penrith in Sydney’s outer-west have returned Liberal members of parliament at each of the last four federal polls, and yet continued to elect Labor MPs with healthy margins at each state poll over the same period. Indeed, last Saturday Penrith {{was one of the few}} NSW electorates to record a significant swing towards the ALP. If I were the PM, that result would have me worried. No doubt NSW Premier Morris Iemma was merrily stirring the pot when he claimed on the weekend that the federal government’s IR legislation, Work Choices, was the key factor in returning state Labor for a fourth term. In fact it’s too early to say yet exactly how important a role IR played in the NSW result. Yet Iemma was <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>one</b> <b>thing.</b> Work Choices has succeeded in unhitching the federal-state division of roles that’s served the Coalition so well over the last decade. Following this division the federal Coalition has succeeded in presenting itself as a force for stability and predictability, and a prudent foil to the more open-handed social policies of state administrations. The IR laws are scrambling up this picture. Instead they seem to present the PM as a kind of industrial adventurist, performing an arcane laboratory-experiment upon a nervous citizenry. This leaves the state premiers free to present themselves, not as policy spendthrifts, but rather as voices of prudence and caution, trying to ameliorate the effects of this new industrial experiment. These simple facts points to the spark of genius behind Kevin Rudd’s otherwise doleful rhetoric about “ending the blame-game” between state and federal governments. If Labor is to reign once more at the federal level, it has to present itself both as the party of economic management and service delivery, of prudence and compassion. It has to persuade the good burghers of Penrith - and their cousins elsewhere across our wide suburban expanses - that state-federal relations work better as a partnership than as a separation of powers. And persuade them to give once again at the federal level the votes they’ve continued to offer Labor in state polls. Howard is certainly no Peter Debnam. Yet he has begun to seem a somewhat ‘riskier’ proposition than previously. The bell that tolled for Peter Debnam in Penrith could be starting to tinkle faintly for John Howard across the bleached front yards of the nation. • David Burchell teaches in Humanities at the University of Western Sydney, and is associate editor of APO.
