Having learned of the threat, Mega Man's rival Bass decides to take matters into his own hands. The game is an action-platformer where the player advances by defeating bosses and acquiring their signature weapons.

5|$|For {{the three}} {{sections}} of the ride where wrap-around projection is used, each <b>robotic</b> arm continues its steady movement on the track but is met by its own individual parabolic projection screen and projector traveling {{at exactly the same}} pace. Each projection section uses a huge turntable with six of these enormous screens mounted facing outwards - one for each <b>robotic</b> arm as they pass by - and each screen is large enough that when in front of each ride bench its edges cannot be seen. The screens appear and disappear behind the edges of the physical sets. The <b>robotic</b> arms can then freely dive, turn and pivot each ride bench within the curved area, giving the illusion of extreme movement when synchronized with the projection, whilst the base of the arm on the track simply follows the slow circular path that each screen takes as it revolves. This is why each projection section of the ride is approximately the same length, as each ride arm must follow each identically-sized projection screen turntable for a set period of time.|$|E

Showrunner Vincent Waller stated that the mobile unit was introduced because having Karen able to move was more convenient for storytelling purposes.
