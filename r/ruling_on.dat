5|$|After the Nazi Party {{seized power}} on 30 January 1933, the black-red-gold flag was swiftly scrapped; a <b>ruling</b> <b>on</b> 12 March {{established}} two legal national flags: the reintroduced black-white-red imperial tricolour and {{the flag of}} the Nazi Party.|$|E
5|$|A third alternative, {{noting that}} Edward in 978 {{was very close}} to <b>ruling</b> <b>on</b> his own, proposes that Ealdorman Ælfhere was behind the killing so as to {{preserve}} his own influence and to prevent Edward taking revenge for Ælfhere's actions earlier in the reign. John notes this and interprets Ælfhere's part in Edward's reburial as being a penance for the assassination.|$|E
5|$|According to Lennon, the {{inspiration}} for the first two verses was the death of Tara Browne, the 21-year-old heir to the Guinness fortune who had crashed his Lotus Elan on 18 December 1966 in Redcliffe Gardens, Earl's Court. Browne had been a friend of Lennon and McCartney, and had, earlier in 1966, instigated McCartney's first experience with LSD. Lennon adapted the song's verse lyrics from a story in the 17 January 1967 edition of the Daily Mail, which reported the <b>ruling</b> <b>on</b> a custody action over Browne's two young children.|$|E

5|$|After the Invasion of Poland in 1939, Goebbels {{used his}} {{propaganda}} ministry and the Reich chambers to control {{access to information}} domestically. To his chagrin, his rival Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, continually challenged Goebbels' jurisdiction over the dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm <b>ruling</b> <b>on</b> the subject, so the two men remained rivals {{for the remainder of}} the Nazi era. Goebbels did not participate in the military decision making process, nor was he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after the fact.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the appellate}} <b>ruling,</b> <b>on</b> September 21, 2007, Judge Mauffray denied {{the request for}} Bell to be {{eligible}} for bail pending possible further appeal. On September 26, Parish Attorney Walters announced that the prosecution would not appeal the appellate ruling, but would try Bell as a juvenile. Bell was released on $45,000bond, subject to electronic monitoring and under the supervision of a probation officer.|$|E
5|$|On 2 July 2008, U.S. District Court judge Brian Cogan of the Eastern District of New York {{dismissed}} the families' suits {{against all the}} U.S. based defendants under the premise of forum non-conveniens.

5|$|The {{outcomes}} of the confirmation of charges hearings were announced on 23 January 2012.

5|$|The university's {{administration}} is structured {{in a way}} similar to other public universities in Brazil. The supreme decision body is the University Council (CONSU), composed of all deans, plus several representatives from the academic community, students, administrative staff and the external community. The council meets roughly 4 to 5 times per year, <b>ruling</b> <b>on</b> high level administrative decisions such as approving the budget and has the final word in internal administrative processes. Routine {{administration is}} left to the rector, similar to a university chancellor in English-speaking countries, and the rectorate.|$|E

5|$|A $30,000 supersedeas bond {{was issued}} in August 1965 as the United Bond Insurance Company {{continued}} to dispute {{the payment of}} Kinne's original $25,000 bond. The supersedeas bond allowed the company to defer payment of the $25,000 bond until a <b>ruling</b> <b>on</b> the matter was handed down by the Missouri Supreme Court, but when that court upheld the bond's forfeiture, the $25,000 was paid to the State of Missouri in October 1965. The United Bond Insurance Company later filed suit against Kinne's family to recover {{the cost of the}} bail, lawyer's fees, and searching for Kinne after her escape.|$|E

5|$|By early 1944 Treloar was overworked {{and unhappy}} {{to be in}} Melbourne instead of at the Memorial. He was also uncomfortable with {{the way in which}} Bean and the AWM's acting {{director}} Arthur Bazley were running the Memorial in his absence, and sought to intervene in its management. This degree of intervention frustrated Bazley, and led to increasing conflict between the two men who had worked together since 1917. Their relationship worsened in 1945, and the Memorial's board was eventually forced to make a <b>ruling</b> <b>on</b> what Bazley and Treloar's responsibilities were. In 1946, Bazley left the Memorial to take a job in the Department of Immigration due to continuing tensions with Treloar.|$|E
5|$|Debs appealed his {{conviction}} to the Supreme Court. In its <b>ruling</b> <b>on</b> Debs v. United States, the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding World War I and socialism. While Debs had carefully worded his speeches {{in an attempt}} to comply with the Espionage Act, the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. stated in his opinion that little attention was needed since Debs' case was essentially {{the same as that of}} Schenck v. United States, in which the Court had upheld a similar conviction.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{power is}} {{exercised}} by the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers {{which make up}} the government, while the legislative power is vested in the unicameral parliament, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature, and the Constitutional Court is charged with <b>ruling</b> <b>on</b> the conformity of laws and decrees with the constitution. The Council of State is the tribunal of last resort for administrative cases, and the High Court of Appeals for all others. The prime minister is elected by the parliament through {{a vote of confidence}} in the government and is most often the head of the party having the most seats in parliament. The prime minister is Binali Yıldırım, who replaced Ahmet Davutoğlu on 24 May 2016.|$|E

5|$|Kalimpong {{has access}} {{to most of the}} {{television}} channels aired in the rest of India. Cable Television still provides service to many homes in the town and it's outskirts, while DTH connections are now practically mandatory throughout the country. Besides mainstream Indian channels, many Nepali-language channels such as Dainandini DD Kalimpong Television KTv Haal Khabar (an association of the Hill Channel Network), Jan Sarokar, Himalayan People's Channel (HPC), and Kalimpong Times are broadcast in Kalimpong. These channels, which mainly broadcast locally relevant news, are produced by regional media houses and news networks, and are broadcast through the local cable network, which is now slowly becoming defunct due to the Indian government's <b>ruling</b> <b>on</b> mandatory digitization of TV channels.|$|E
5|$|Madzimbamuto petitioned for {{the right}} to appeal against his {{detention}} to the Privy Council in London; the Rhodesian Appellate Division ruled that he had no right to do so, but the Privy Council considered his case anyway. It ruled in his favour on 23 July 1968, deciding that orders for detention made by the Rhodesian government were invalid regardless of whether they were under the 1961 or 1965 constitution, and that Madzimbamuto was illegally detained. Harry Elinder Davies, one of the Rhodesian judges, announced on 8 August that the Rhodesian courts would not consider this ruling binding as they no longer accepted the Privy Council as part of the Rhodesian judicial hierarchy. Justice JR Dendy Young resigned in protest at Davies's <b>ruling</b> <b>on</b> 12 August and four days later became Chief Justice of Botswana. Madzimbamuto would remain in prison until 1974.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeals, Maryland's highest court, {{agreed to}} hear the state's appeal in 2006, {{bypassing}} the intermediate court. To the surprise of spectators, there were almost no questions from the judges during oral argument, which took place on December 4, 2006, causing speculation that the court may have taken the appeal just to reverse the Circuit Court <b>ruling.</b> <b>On</b> September 18, 2007, the court issued its decision in Conaway v. Deane, overturning the trial court ruling for the plaintiffs in a 4–3 decision, and holding that the statutory ban on same-sex marriage did not violate the Maryland Constitution.|$|E
