5|$|Neil McKenna's 2003 biography, The Secret Life of Oscar Wilde, {{offers an}} {{exploration}} of Wilde's sexuality. Often speculative in nature, it was widely criticised for its pure conjecture and lack of scholarly rigour. Thomas Wright's Oscar's Books (2008) explores Wilde's <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> his childhood in Dublin to his death in Paris. After tracking down many books that once belonged to Wilde's Tite Street library (dispersed {{at the time of}} his trials), Wright was the first to examine Wilde's marginalia.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> the Gospel of Mark, the healing of a deaf mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, the believer should be open to admire God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Kirthana Ramisetti of Entertainment Weekly posted that The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., {{deserved}} to be released on DVD. Gord Lacey, {{the creator of the}} website TVShowsonDVD.com, told the New York Daily News that Brisco was among the five most requested shows on the site. Lacey spent several years lobbying industry contacts to get Brisco released on DVD. This led to correspondence with Cuse, who also wanted to get a DVD set produced. On July 18, 2006, Warner Home Video released The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.: The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1, an 8-disc DVD set that contains all 27 episodes of the series. The release includes commentary tracks from Campbell and Cuse; an interactive menu of Brisco's signature references narrated by Campbell; The History of Brisco County, Jr., documentary; a feature called A <b>Reading</b> <b>from</b> the Book of Bruce; and another gallery hosted by Campbell focusing on the gadgets from the show.|$|E
5|$|PA 222 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-78/PA 309 {{in the community}} of Dorneyville in South Whitehall Township in Lehigh County, where the road continues southwest as US 222 towards <b>Reading.</b> <b>From</b> this interchange, PA 222 heads northeast on four-lane divided Hamilton Boulevard, passing between Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom to the north and businesses to the south. Direct access to Dorney Park is limited to PA 222 southbound, as northbound traffic must make a left turn onto Lincoln Avenue to access the park. After passing the amusement park, the route splits into two carriageways, with PA 222 north remaining on Hamilton Boulevard and PA 222 south following the newer Hamilton Boulevard Bypass to the north. A short distance to the east, the road intersects Cedar Crest Boulevard, a major northsouth arterial in the Allentown metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|Parker {{was born}} in Cortland, New York, to John Brooks Parker, a farmer, and Harriet F. Stratton. Both of his parents were well educated and {{encouraged}} his <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> an early age. At the age of 12 or 13, Parker watched his father serve as a juror and was so fascinated by the proceedings that he resolved to become a lawyer. However, he trained initially {{as a teacher and}} taught in Binghamton. There he became engaged to Mary Louise Schoonmaker, the daughter of a man who owned property near his school. Parker married Schoonmaker in 1872 and became a clerk at Schoonmaker & Hardenburgh, a legal firm at which one of her relatives was the senior partner. He then enrolled at Albany Law School of Union University, New York. After graduating with an LL.B. degree in 1873, he practiced law in Kingston until 1878 as the senior partner of the firm Parker & Kenyon.|$|E

Despite Amy's insistence, the Doctor refuses to read ahead to reveal {{spoilers}} and tears out the last page of the book. Meanwhile, Rory goes to get coffee and is {{sent back to the}} 1930s by a cherub Weeping Angel. There, he meets River Song, who is playing the part of Melody Malone. In the present, the Doctor and Amy are shocked to find Rory written into the book. Amy insists on reading ahead, but the Doctor warns her that anything she reads will be destined to happen. Instead, they attempt to take the TARDIS back to the 1930s, finding the time machine struggling to make the journey.|$|E
5|$|The Five Nights at Freddy's: Survival Logbook is the series's second guidebook. It {{was first}} {{discovered}} on Amazon on mid 2017. Although {{it has never}} been confirmed by Cawthon himself, several suggestions have stated that the guidebook will explore simple activities for children as they play the video games, or to familiarize new players to the game play of Five Nights at Freddy's. This new title is surmised to have crossword puzzles and word searches, instead of hidden lore or narrative hints about the Five Nights at Freddy's franchise. Unlike most of the previous book releases, the Survival Logbook has no listed Amazon Kindle editions, implying that it will have pages designed for physical writing as opposed to simply <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> a device. The book is scheduled for release on December 26, 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{essay was}} {{extensively}} {{discussed in the}} media and the blogosphere, with reactions to Carr's argument being polarised. At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.|$|E

5|$|The overall {{performance}} of an SSD {{is dependent upon}} a number of factors, including write amplification. Writing to a flash memory device takes longer than <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> it. An SSD generally uses multiple flash memory components connected in parallel to increase performance. If the SSD has a high write amplification, the controller {{will be required to}} write that many more times to the flash memory. This requires even more time to write the data from the host. An SSD with a low write amplification will not need to write as much data and can therefore be finished writing sooner than a drive with a high write amplification.|$|E
5|$|Although {{many of the}} {{convective}} bands {{were already}} located over the Yucatán Peninsula, Hurricane Dean continued to intensify until the eye made landfall. As the eye moved over Mexico {{near the town of}} Majahual in the Costa Maya area, the NHC estimated surface level winds of 175mph (280km/h), making Dean the first storm to make landfall as a Category5 hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. At the same time, a dropsonde <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> the hurricane's eye estimated a central pressure of 905mbar, making Dean the third most intense landfalling Atlantic storm in history (after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and Hurricane Gilbert of 1988) and tying Dean with Camille and Mitch as the seventh most intense hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic basin. The landfall itself occurred in a sparsely populated area of the Costa Maya region of the Mexican state of Quintana Roo near 18.7N 87.8W at 0900UTC August21 and brought with it a storm surge of 12–18ft (3.7–5.5m). A weather station at Chetumal (the capital of Quintana Roo, Mexico) reported 6.65in (17cm) of rainfall during Hurricane Dean's landfall. As expected, the landfall caused significant weakening of the storm; the eye filled and the cold cloud-tops warmed. The land severely disrupted the storm's organization, and by the time Dean crossed the Yucatán Peninsula it had weakened to a Category1 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa suggest Homer have a go at voice acting {{when they}} read {{that there will be}} open auditions. Homer auditions to read for Poochie's voice, and gets the part. He and June Bellamy, his fellow voice actor, make several {{publicity}} stops to promote Poochie, where Homer confronts the show's hardcore fans. Homer invites all of his friends and relatives to the screening of the first Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show. However, the cartoon is full of clichés and asinine antics, and by emphasizing Poochie, contains none of the show's trademark violence. Everyone except Homer finds the episode unimpressive. Meyers is forced to admit that Poochie's debut was a dud, and he decides {{to get rid of the}} character. Homer learns that Poochie will be killed off, and resolves to keep Poochie alive. At his next recording session, rather than <b>reading</b> <b>from</b> the script, he implores the audience, through lines that he wrote, to give Poochie a fair chance. The writing team appears moved by Homer's statement. However, on airing, his statement is dubbed over by Myers and Poochie is killed off in a poorly edited fashion. The in-studio audience cheers wildly as Krusty promises that Poochie is gone for good. Homer feels betrayed but attributes the affair to the nature of show business.|$|E

5|$|My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy {{opens with}} a {{dedication}} to Daws Butler, a list of acknowledgements and a foreword from Cartwright's The Simpsons co-star Dan Castellaneta. The first chapter of the book details Cartwright's life and career prior to 1987. In the second chapter, Cartwright recalls the day she went to audition for a role {{in a series of}} animated shorts on The Tracey Ullman Show. The shorts were about a dysfunctional family and Cartwright intended to audition for the role of Lisa Simpson, the eldest daughter. Upon arriving at the audition, she found the role of her brother Bart to be much more interesting. Matt Groening, creator of the shorts, allowed her to audition for Bart, and gave her the job on the spot after hearing her <b>reading.</b> <b>From</b> there, the book contains her experiences as the voice of Bart. After three seasons of shorts, a half-hour spinoff called The Simpsons debuted in 1989. In the following chapters, she recalls the early days of The Simpsons, commenting on the recording process and her co-stars and revealing how she got the roles of some of the other characters she voices, including Nelson Muntz and Ralph Wiggum. In the 15th chapter, she discusses her experiences of voicing a famous character, but rarely being recognized.|$|E
