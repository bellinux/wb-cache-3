2500|$|Enterprise risk {{management}} (ERM or E.R.M.) in business includes {{the methods and}} processes used by organizations to manage risks and seize opportunities related to the achievement of their objectives. [...] ERM provides a framework for {{risk management}}, which typically involves identifying particular events or circumstances relevant to the organization's objectives (<b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunities),</b> assessing {{them in terms of}} likelihood and magnitude of impact, determining a response strategy, and monitoring progress. [...] By identifying and proactively addressing <b>risks</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunities,</b> business enterprises protect and create value for their stakeholders, including owners, employees, customers, regulators, and society overall.|$|E

40|$|Climate {{change is}} an {{international}} environmental issue that has increasingly attracted business attention {{in the past decade}} because of its actual or potential strategic impact on many companies. This study aims to examine how <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunity</b> awareness is correlated with corporate management and strategy. This study obtains firm data from a questionnaire survey of CDP in 2013, and the data includes 899 observations for <b>risk</b> awareness <b>and</b> 827 observations for opportunity awareness in 64 countries and 20 industry groups. Using the data, this study empirically examines how firms' management <b>and</b> strategy affect <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunity</b> awareness related to climate change in the regression analysis. By regression analysis, we find some types of corporate climate-related governances and strategies are related to <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunity</b> awareness. The regression result also shows that there seems to be few differences between the effectiveness of firms' climate-related management on their business <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunity</b> awareness related to climate change. Corporate strategies such as setting emissions reduction targets, launching emissions reduction initiatives, participating emissions trading schemes, and originating/purchasing carbon credits are proved found to be beneficial for increasing the corporate <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunity</b> awarenes...|$|R

[...] The NRC was particularly critical of the program's failure to engage stakeholders or advance scientific understanding of the impacts of climate change on human well-being.

[...] President Bush reestablished priorities for climate change research to focus on scientific information that can be developed within 2 to 5 years to assist evaluation of strategies to address global change risks.

An experiment examined the impact of both frames on support for EU enlargement. Participants in the opportunity frame condition showed significantly higher levels of support compared to participants in the risk condition. This framing effect was moderated by political knowledge. Individuals with low levels of political knowledge were more affected by the news frames and more susceptible to risk framing. � Key Words EU enlargement, framing effects, moderators of framing effects, news framing, <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunity</b> framin...|$|R

Indeed, we consider that alternatives are evaluated against several objectives by using many features of them known as attributes. Taking into account uncertainty of some components or relationships, this paper proposes explicit modeling of <b>risk</b> <b>and</b> <b>opportunity</b> in the BOCR framework.
