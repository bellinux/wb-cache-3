5|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} SITA had plans to build another EfW plant adjacent to the current one, named the North East Energy <b>Recovery</b> <b>Centre</b> (NEERC). SITA UK began consulting key partners, stakeholders and local residents on these plans in April 2008, before submitting a formal planning application that summer. Permission for the plant's construction was granted on 15 October 2008. On 17 September 2010, it {{was announced}} that SITA had signed a contract with the South Tyne and Wear Waste Management Partnership for their waste to be burned at NEERC once the plant was completed. Construction is expected to begin in early 2011, in time for a 2013 completion date.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} one of the most modern {{incinerators}} operating in England; it is noted for its innovative operation. In 2009, an extension was completed at the station, with the construction of an extra furnace line and a rail head. This increased the capacities of the plant from 19.2MW and 250,000 tonnes of waste per year to its current levels. The plant initially burned only waste from Teesside, but this was extended to include Northumberland with the 2009 extension. A second plant, the North East Energy <b>Recovery</b> <b>Centre</b> (NEERC), has planning permission to be built on land adjacent to the current plant. If built, this will extend the plant's catchment to include waste from south Tyne and Wear.|$|E

25|$|During the 1990s Eno became {{increasingly}} interested in self-generating musical systems, {{the results of}} which he called generative music. The basic premise of generative music is the blending of several independent musical tracks, of varying sounds, length, and in some cases, silence. When each individual track concludes, it starts again mixing with the other tracks allowing the listener to hear an almost infinite combination. In one instance of generative music, Eno calculated {{that it would take}} almost 10,000 years to hear the entire possibilities of one individual piece. He has presented this music in his own, and other artists', art and sound installations, most notably I Dormienti (The Sleepers), , Music for Civic <b>Recovery</b> <b>Centre,</b> The Quiet Room and Music for Prague.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The pet {{trade is}} an {{important}} business {{around the world and}} one of the factors that might menace some wild populations. If wild animals are collected to maintain them as pets, this activity can produce several problems: i) an increase of population vulnerability, {{especially in the case of}} rare species; ii) the release of exotic pets in natural habitats, with the risk of competition with native species and the spreading of parasites and diseases, and iii) the maintenance of animals of unknown origin in <b>Recovery</b> <b>Centres</b> or zoos, which if too numerous are sacrificed or re-located to their supposed original regions. In this paper, we used seven microsatellite loci to analyze genetic diversity and genetic structure of the European pond turtle (Emys obicularis) covering the species range in the Iberian Peninsula. A Bayesian test revealed a genotypic differentiation between the regions sampled where most individuals (90 %) were assigned to their sampling location with a probability higher than 95 %. The likelihood values for individuals from <b>Recovery</b> <b>Centres</b> to came from one of our populations was higher than 90 % in 22 out of 36 individuals. This work is a first step to relocate animals of unknown origin taking into account genetic similarities and contribute to reinforcement programs of endangered species...|$|R

5000|$|In August 2012 a {{group of}} wounded ex-servicemen, {{featured}} in a report for BBCs Newsnight, criticised Help for Heroes for {{its relationship to the}} Ministry of Defence. The criticism was levelled because of the charitys decision to use funds to subsidise expensive MOD buildings rather than for soldiers everyday care. The charity has agreed to spend £153 million on constructing and running five regional MOD Personnel <b>Recovery</b> <b>Centres,</b> primarily for serving military personnel, which discharged servicemen can only use on a case-by-case basis. A subsequent investigation by the BBCs Editorial Complaints Unit into the original Newsnight report upheld the charitys complaint about the programme and concluded that [...] "there was no evidence to back Newsnights claim about Help for Heroes".|$|R
40|$|The {{coastal waters}} along Tuscany (Central Italy) {{are thought to}} {{represent}} a good foraging ground for loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta), especially, but not only, during the juvenile phase. We describe the movements of three juvenile loggerheads released along the Tuscany coast after having been accidentally caught by fishermen and rehabilitated by <b>recovery</b> <b>centres</b> of the region. The turtles were tracked by satellite for 20 - 125 days, displaying two main movement patterns. Two turtles remained in neritic coastal waters for the whole duration of tracking, while the third one moved north soon after release, reaching the northern Ligurian Sea with an open-sea route. These findings show that loggerheads can use Tuscany waters both as a profitable long-term foraging site and as a transit area during their movements towards other destinations...|$|R

40|$|Measurements of {{residual}} resistance {{have been used}} to study the recovery of high-purity potassium wires deformed at 4 · 2 K and below. Details of the full recovery spectrum are given in this paper.

Point defects anneal in this stage by a process which involves several mechanisms, discussed in the following paper. The parameter of chief interest in the recovery process is the migration energy of the monovacancy, E 1 v M.

40|$|Aspergillosis is a {{fungal disease}} caused by fungi {{of the genus}} Aspergillus, in {{particular}} A. fumigatus and A. flavus. This paper focuses on anatomopathological aspects resulting from a chronic infection from Aspergillus spp in the chicken (Gallus domesticus), in the herring gull (Larus cachinnans micaelli) and in the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa rufa). Microscopically, we observed some histological lesions {{that are related to}} the two typical forms of Aspergillosis: a deep nodular form, typical of organs with a non-aerated parenchyma, and a non-encapsulated superficial diffuse form typical of the serosae and the lung. The observed forms of aspergillosis have been found in animals raised in poor hygienic environmental conditions or malnourished animals (chicken); in wild birds from wildlife <b>recovery</b> <b>centres</b> (herring gull), which underwent some forms of stress, such as traumas, detention, starvation, extended antibiotic treatments; in game birds (red-legged partridge) used for restocking natural areas that had been negatively affected by such stressors as captivity in aviaries, containment and transport in cages, release in unsuitable environments and malnutrition. The observed anatomopathological and istopathological aspects can therefore be regarded as the outcome of a number of factors that have reduced the typical resistance of the species and impaired the efficiency of their immune systems...|$|R
