5|$|A {{centre of}} {{religious}} discussions called Anubhava Mantapa ("Hall of experience") in Kalyani became the conclave where devotees gathered {{to discuss their}} mystic experiences. Here, they expressed their devotion to Shiva in simple poems called Vachanas. These were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic, epigrammatical and satirical prose emphasising the worthlessness of riches, <b>rituals</b> <b>and</b> book learning. Many of these poems are anonymous, but the authors are identifiable by the unique divine name of the god Shiva that is invoked in the poem.|$|E

They controlled the means for agriculture and determined guilt or innocence in disputes.|$|E

5|$|Cox {{has also}} said {{that there is a}} massive irony, both in the film and in real life, that a {{religion}} so focused on the family and its importance is ripping families apart through its teaching on homosexuality.

5|$|Family is {{the primary}} social and {{political}} grouping in Torajan society. Each village is one extended family, the seat {{of which is the}} tongkonan, a traditional Torajan house. Each tongkonan has a name, which becomes the name of the village. The familial dons maintain village unity. Marriage between distant cousins (fourth cousins and beyond) is a common practice that strengthens kinship. Toraja society prohibits marriage between close cousins (up to and including the third cousin)—except for nobles, to prevent the dispersal of property. Kinship is actively reciprocal, meaning that the extended family helps each other farm, share buffalo <b>rituals,</b> <b>and</b> pay off debts.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{the state}} created the wartime shrine board, which {{expanded}} control over state shrines and expanded the state's role. Up to that point, individual priests had been {{limited in their}} political roles, delegated to certain <b>rituals</b> <b>and</b> shrine upkeep, and rarely encouraged Emperor worship, or other aspects of state ideology, independently. No shrine priest, or member of the Wartime Shrine board, had previously sought public office, which some scholars, such as Sakamoto, suggest is evidence of the state's use of Shinto to its own ends, rather than the Shinto priest's attempt to achieve political power.|$|E

5|$|In Hastings's view, Lang was {{probably}} {{more sympathetic to}} Rome than any other Church of England archbishop of modern times, responsible for a discreet catholicisation of the Church of England's practices. A small outward indication of this was his decision to use a cassock as everyday dress and to wear a mitre on formal occasions, the first archbishop since the English Reformation to do so. Lang believed that {{in relation to the}} supreme truths of the church, <b>rituals</b> <b>and</b> dress were of small account, but that if people's worship was assisted by such customs they should be allowed.|$|E
5|$|It's a touching, believable, often funny but {{ultimately}} sad tale {{of how one}} class {{can take advantage of}} another, even in the guise of patronizing benevolence. Though sometimes shifting abruptly in time, Vanaja is an arresting story of modern-day hardship and class exploitation, recalling Charles Dickens as well as Western fairy-tale lore. Domalpalli's settings are ultra-real in detail and color, from the crude, almost feudal deprivations of Vanaja's dirt-floor background to the stately <b>rituals</b> <b>and</b> autocratic entitlement of the well-to-do.|$|E
5|$|King {{shows how}} enslaved {{children}} were educated for survival and resistance. This education was usually informal and parental and {{taught how to}} deal with slaveowners and their abuse. King also named literacy and religion's role in their education. Kids were taught mutual cooperation as a virtue between slaves. Few slaves had formal education and those who did were artisans. Those educated or given religious training were only by the fortune of their owner's interests. King's stories tell of children in domestic, farm, and industrial work, who spent their free time in celebrations, dances, games, folk <b>rituals,</b> <b>and</b> hunting.|$|E

5|$|Most generally, State Shinto {{refers to}} any use of Shinto {{practices}} {{incorporated into the}} national ideology during the Meiji period starting in 1868.

State Shinto is also understood to refer to the state <b>rituals</b> <b>and</b> ideology of Emperor-worship, which was not a traditional emphasis of Shinto — of the 124 Japanese emperors, only 20 have dedicated shrines.|$|E
5|$|Mythology has it {{that the}} forests of Vajjabhumi (west Birbhum) were hot-spots of Hindu and tantric activities.

Birbhum has many Shakti Peethas such as Tarapith, Bakreshwar, Kankalitala, Fullara near Labhpur, Sainthia and Nalhati.
