40|$|We {{describe}} {{the construction of}} a prototype hybrid permanent magnet dipole and quadruple. The magnet consists of two concentric rings of SmCo magnetic material 5 cm in length. The outer ring is made of 16 uniformly magnetized blocks assembled as a Halbach dipole and the inner ring has 32 blocks oriented in a similar fashion so as to generate a quadruple field. The resultant superimposed field is an offset quadruple field which allows us to center the field on the high-energy beam in the interaction region of the PEPII B factory. The dipole blocks are glued to the inside surface of an outer support collar and the quadruple blocks are held in a fixture that allows <b>radial</b> <b>adjustment</b> of the blocks prior to potting the entire assembly with epoxy. An extensive computer model of the magnet has been made and from this model we developed a tuning algorithm that allowed us to greatly reduce the n= 3 - 17 harmonics of the magnet.

40|$|Finger seals {{present a}} {{compliant}} seal alternative to brush seals and through their geometric configuration {{bring about the}} added potential of hydrodynamic lifting and thus non-contacting operational feature. The fingers ’ compliance allows both axial and <b>radial</b> <b>adjustment</b> to rotor excursions without damage to the integrity or performance of the seal. The work to be presented here concerns the mapping of the thermofluid and dynamic behavior of repetitive section of the newly proposed design of a two layer Finger Seal. The assembly contains four high pressure (HP) and four low pressure (LP) fingers arranged axially in a staggered configuration, and subject to an axial pressure drop. The numerical 3 -D results presented herein were obtained using customized commercial packages CFD-ACE+. The results were obtained in a parametric fashion were the HP side, and the compressibility are the controlling parameters. In addition, two limiting thermal cases were also studied {{in conjunction with the}} previously mentioned parameters. The entire study is aimed at generating reliable design procedures for the parametric design of a finger seal. It was found that the geometry proposed provides satisfactory lifting capability for the fingers; that the stiffness of the finger is comparably small to that of the fluid, and thus the displacement transmissibility is mostly close to 1. The stiffness and damping characteristics of the solid padded finger and that of the fluid are also studied and presented on a parametric basis...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} a custom VUV {{microscope}} is studied. The microscope is designed around a custom high brightness, spectrally narrow VUV source operating at the Hydrogen-Lyman-α (HLA) transition characterized by the emission wavelength of 121. 6 nm. The incentive for microscopy at 121. 6 nm is a transparent window in the air absorption spectrum coinciding with 121. 6 nm light. This allows for the sample to be in air while the microscope is in an enclosed vacuum or nitrogen environment. A microscope is built consisting of the VUV source, a low noise, x-ray camera, a custom 120 magnification, 0. 3 numerical aperture objective lens, {{and an assortment of}} vacuum flanges, nipples, and crosses. The camera is verified to detect the HLA output from the source. The objective lens is capable of achieving an intrinsic resolution of 247 nm with a wavelength of 121. 6 nm if the proposed alignment procedure is followed and the fabricated mechanical tolerances are within the specified range. The objective lens mirrors and the primary mirror cell are fabricated out of specification. Therefore, the best expected optical performance is 0. 3 Strehl ratio. In order to improve the optical performance, a few design changes are discussed, including increasing the primary mirror thickness to improve surface figure error and increasing the back thickness of the primary mirror cell {{in order to reduce the}} force on the primary mirror from <b>radial</b> <b>adjustment</b> screws...|$|E
40|$|The Mercator Advanced Imager for Asteroseismology (MAIA) {{is being}} {{designed}} particularly for asteroseismology of hot subdwarf {{stars on the}} 1. 2 m Mercator Telescope. In order to achieve the required precision on the pulsation amplitude ratios, the photometric variations must be measured simultaneously in several bands with respect to constant reference stars in the field. MAIA is an optical imager to observe simultaneously in three color bands, corresponding approximately with an SDSS u, g, r+i+z photometric system. The fully dioptric design uses a common collimator, two dichroic beam splitters (cut-offs at 390 nm and 550 nm) and three cameras. Each camera holds a fast frame-transfer CCD cooled down to - 90 ◦C with a compact Stirling cryocooler. All lenses are axially and radially constrained by a calibrated spring load, with <b>radial</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanisms to calibrate the centering of each lens. The differential thermal expansion of the optical system is compensated by the thermal expansion of the different materials in the mechanical mountings, resulting in a design that is insensitive to thermal variations. Specific care has been taken to reduce the effect of manufacturing tolerances {{on the performance of}} the instrument. The tilt angle of two of the beam splitters is adjustable in two dimensions to compensate for remaining misalignment in the optical system. Finite element models have been constructed to verify that the structural flexure and structural dynamics are within the requirements.

40|$|In {{analogy to}} the {{geographical}} {{representation of the}} zeroth-order radial orbit perturbations due to the static geopotential, similar relationships have been derived for radial orbit perturbations due to the ocean tides. At each location these perturbations are seen to be coherent with the tide height variations. The study of this singularity is of obvious importance to the estimation of ocean tides from satellite altimeter data. We derive analytical expressions for the sensitivity of altimeter derived ocean tide models to the ocean tide force model induced errors in the orbits of the altimeter satellite. In particular, we focus on characterizing and quantifying the nonresonant tidal orbit perturbations, which cannot be adjusted into the empirical accelerations or <b>radial</b> perturbation <b>adjustments</b> commonly used during orbit determination and in altimeter data processing. As an illustration of the utility of this technique, we study the differences between a TOPEX/POSEIDON-derived ocean tide model and the Cartwright and Ray 1991 Geosat model. This analysis shows that nearly 60 % of the variance of this difference for M(sub 2) {{can be explained by}} the Geosat radial orbit eror due to the omission of coefficients from the GEM-T 2 background ocean tide model. For O(sub 1), K(sub 1), S(sub 2), and K(sub 2) the orbital effects account for approximately 10 to 40 % of the variances of these differences. The utility of this technique to assessment of the ocean tide induced errors in the TOPEX/POSEIDON-derived tide models is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop and}} assess a new orbital tuning {{approach}} by applying differential Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry. We use interferograms {{of the same}} site for estimating across-track and <b>radial</b> orbit <b>adjustments</b> from fringe gradients caused by orbit uncertainties. Our approach eliminates these fringes by using the improved short-arc orbit estimates. Taking six estimates from the Delft Institute for Earth-Orientated Space Research (DEOS), the approach yields mean standard deviations of 2. 4 cm for the across-track and 4. 5 cm for the radial components. The interferograms calculated with our post-fit orbital estimates compare favorably with those corrected with a conventional orbital tuning approach. We can now distinguish between orbital and deformation contributions to interferometric SAR phase gradients {{and are able to}} measure surface deformation changes over an interseismic time interval longer than one year. Our new approach is limited, however, to well-correlated interferograms where it is possible to measure the fringe gradient. We have also applied Permanent Scatterers (PS) technique to 42 SAR images acquired by ERS between August 1992 and June 1998. This approach estimates the average range change rate of more than 3 million PS with a formal standard deviation of 0. 3 mm/yr along the line of sight. We obtain a phase coherence factor greater than 0. 8 and a standard deviation of 3 mm for a single Line Of Sight (LOS) measurement. This velocity field is much easier to interpret than the separate interferometric pairs. Interpreting these interesting features in terms of geophysical models of inter-seismic and post-seismic deformation, however, will require further research effort...|$|R
40|$|Using an input–oriented DEA {{model with}} the {{assumption}} of VRS, this paper develops a framework on agricultural production efficiency including 2 outputs and 6 inputs. The data source is a survey to 99 household farms of Hebei province, China, conducted by the authors in 2010. According to the efficiency scores of DEA, the sampled farms are divided into three types, {{and the status of}} returns to scale for each farm is examined as well. Slack analysis of the outputs shows that comparing with net profit, ratio of net profit can be increased with a larger margin. Meanwhile, the <b>radial</b> and slack <b>adjustments</b> indicate the inefficient and redundant amounts of the inputs, respectively.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} reactor for kinetic studies has been simulated using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD). Analysis of temperature distribution within the system shows that adding an inert monolith upstream the catalyst enhances heat conduction and therefore significantly reduces <b>radial</b> temperature gradients. <b>Adjustment</b> of the heating coil {{plays an important role}} as well by allowing the gas phase to smooth out the radial temperature profile. Radiative heat transfer and its effects on both the heat losses from the catalyst and on the measurements with an unprotected thermocouple have been particularly investigated. In order to prevent both the falsifying effect of radiation and the influences from the ongoing reaction, thermocouples should be placed and shielded inside a clogged channel. An inert monolith that is placed downstream the catalyst effectively serves as a radiation shield and drastically reduces both axial and radial gradients. Studies of the dispersion in the system reveal that the FTIR's gas cell is the most important source of the overall broadening in the concentration signal, with the reactor tube being the next major source of the distortion. An algorithm based on the Tikhonov regularization method has been developed for calculating the deconvolution of the concentration data, which has refined the time-resolution in transient experiments from 20 to 2 s...|$|R
40|$|Scraped surface heat {{exchangers}} {{are used in}} the food industry to process highly viscous fluids, and ice-cream in particular, but most of the time, the influence of operating conditions on product quality is poorly understood. The objective of the study is to develop simple tools to help industrials understand, and then optimise their fabrication process. Residence Time Distribution (RTD) has been characterised in an industrial pilot system during real ice cream production, after the method had been validated in an experimental set-up with a simple mixture of water and sucrose. It has been shown that in its dimensionless form, RTD depend slightly on flow rate and scraper rotational speed. A simple model of flow pattern applicable to SSHE during crystallisation was developed to reproduce the observed RTD. It distinguishes two zones: the volume of fluid near the cooling wall where ice is generated and which is swept by the blades and the volume of fluid near to the rotor. Therefore, the model considers two parallel plug flow reactors with axial dispersion, and which exchange fluid by <b>radial</b> mixing. After <b>adjustment</b> of the model parameters, a good agreement was obtained with experimental results. The flow rate is lower in the zone near the cooling wall; this can be due to a higher ice concentration leading to higher viscosity. This approach can contribute to better understand, optimise and control SSHE used for ice cream production. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|To {{estimate}} a crustal {{deformation field}} after the 28 June 1992 Landers/California earthquake, we use and assess three different geodetique techniques: Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry, the Permanent Scatterers (PS) technique and Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements. First, we apply a new a posteriori orbital filtering approach to reduce noise coming from orbital uncertainties. The appraoch estimates across-track and <b>radial</b> orbit <b>adjustments</b> {{with respect to}} the actual trajectory from fringe gradients in SAR interferograms of the same scene. We recalculate an interferogram whose SAR images were acquired on 7 August 1992 and 18 June 1993 by using the corresponding and improved short-arc orbit estimates. The interferogram calculated with the post-fit orbital estimates compares favorably with that corrected with a conventional one. We can now distinguish between orbital and deformation contributions to interferometric SAR phase gradients and are able to measure surface deformation changes over an inter-seismic time interval longer than one year. Our new approach is limited, however, to well-correlated interferograms where it is possible to measure the fringe gradient. Yet the study of inter-seismic deformation fields with longer time intervals (> 2 yr) is only possible, as long as strong temporal decorrelation does not occur. To overcome this problem, we use the PS technique that estimates the average range change rate of radar reflectors only slightly affected by both temporal and geometrical decorrelation. First processing of 42 SAR images acquired by European Remote Sensing (ERS) satellites between August 1992 and June 1998 has identified 3 million PS with a phase coherence factor greater than 0. 8 and a standard deviation of 3 mm for a single Line Of Sight (LOS) measurement. First estimation of a PS velocity field reveals a regional and inter-seismic gradient of about 0. 25 mm/yr/km with a maximal LOS standard deviation of about 3 mm/yr. Modeling the inter-seimic range change field from horizontal GPS velocity measurements calculated by the Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) confirms the general trend of the PS analysis. The removal of a superimposed linear phase component drops the LOS standard deviation under 0. 5 mm/yr enabling the recognition of local phenomena, such as post-seismic subsidences. Mis-modeled orbital effects are responsible for remaining errors in the inter-seimic range change field estimation. Their modeling in PS analysis thus remains a problem to be solved. Interpreting these interesting features in terms of geophysical models of inter-seismic and post-seismic deformation, however, will require further research effort...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} for tuning the trajectories of the European remote sensing (ERS) satellites is developed and assessed. Differential dual-pass interferometry {{is applied to}} calculate interferograms from the phase difference of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired by the ERS satellites over {{the site of the}} 1992 earthquake in Landers, California. These interferograms contain information about orbital trajectories and geophysical deformation. Beginning with good prior estimates of the orbital trajectories, a radial and an across-track orbital adjustment is estimated at each epoch. The data are the fringe counts along distance and azimuth. Errors in the across-track and radial components of the orbit estimates produce fringes in the interferograms. The spacing between roughly parallel fringes gives the gradients in distance and azimuth coordinates. The approach eliminates these fringes from interferometric pairs spanning relatively short time intervals containing few topographic residuals or atmospheric artefacts. An optimum interferometric path with six SAR acquisitions is selected to study post- and inter-seismic deformation fields. In order to regularize the problem, it is assumed that the <b>radial</b> and across-track <b>adjustments</b> both sum to zero. Applying the adjustment approach to the prior estimates of trajectory from the Delft Institute for Earth-Orientated Space Research (DEOS), root mean squares of 7. 3 cm for the acrosstrack correction components and 2. 4 cm for the radial ones are found. Assuming 0. 1 fringes for the a priori standard deviation of the measurement, the approach yields mean standard deviations of 2. 4 cm for the across-track and 4. 5 cm for the radial components. The approach allows an "interval by interval" improvement of a set of orbital estimates from which post-fit interferograms of different time intervals spanning a total 3. 8 -year inter-seismic time interval can be created. The interferograms calculated with the post-fit orbital estimates compare favorably with those corrected with a conventional orbital tuning approach. Using the adjustment approach, it is possible to distinguish between orbital and deformation contributions to interferometric SAR (InSAR) phase gradients. Surface deformation changes over an inter-seismic time interval longer than one year can be measured. This approach is, however, limited to well-correlated interferograms where it is possible to measure the fringe gradient...|$|R
