It announced an allocation of [...] for the Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission and a clean-energy {{fund for the}} 2010-11 fiscal year, an increase of [...] from the previous budget. The budget encouraged private solar companies by reducing the import duty on solar panels by five percent and exempting solar photovoltaic panels from excise duty. This is expected {{to reduce the cost}} of a rooftop solar-panel installation by 15 to 20 percent. The budget proposed a coal tax of $1 per metric tonne on domestic and imported coal used for power generation. The government has initiated a <b>Renewable</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Certificate</b> (REC) scheme designed to drive investment in low-carbon energy projects.|$|E
50|$|RESOP {{included}} a built-in two-year review process {{that started in}} 2008. During this period, the world-wide industry was also exploring {{a number of different}} ways to implement incentive programs. The main contenders were the feed-in tariff system, like RESOP, and emissions-trading systems like the UK's Renewable Obligation or New Jersey's Solar <b>Renewable</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Certificate.</b> In 2008, Ernst & Young published Renewable energy country attractiveness indices for the first quarter of 2008, which demonstrated that Germany's FIT program was far more successful, delivering more power at lower costs. An earlier report from UC Berkeley demonstrated that job creation with renewables was far higher than fossil fuels, another argument in favour of the German-style program, which was then considered a great success.|$|E

50|$|States with RPS {{programs}} have associated <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>certificate</b> trading programs. RECs provide a {{mechanism by which}} to track the amount of renewable power being sold and to financially reward eligible power producers. For each unit of power that an eligible producer generates, a certificate or credit is issued. These can then be sold either {{in conjunction with the}} underlying power or separately to energy supply companies. A market exists for RECs because energy supply companies are required to redeem certificates equal to their obligation under the RPS program. State specific programs or various applications (e.g., WREGIS, M-RETS, NEPOOL GIS) are used to track REC issuance and ownership. These credits can in some programs be 'banked' (for use in future years) or borrowed (to meet current year commitments). There {{is a great deal of}} variety among the states in the handling and functioning of RECs and this will be a major issue in integrating state and federal programs.|$|E
5000|$|A {{green energy}} {{provider}} (such as a wind farm) {{is credited with}} one REC for every 1,000 kWh or 1 MWh of electricity it produces (for reference, an average residential customer consumes about 800 kWh in a month). A certifying agency gives each REC a unique identification number {{to make sure it}} doesn't get double-counted. The green energy is then fed into the electrical grid (by mandate), and the accompanying REC can then be sold on the open market. [...] "Retirement occurs when a <b>Renewable</b> <b>Energy</b> <b>Certificate</b> (REC) is used by the owner of the REC.
