40|$|A {{test rig}} program was {{conducted}} {{with the objective of}} evaluating and minimizing the exhaust emissions, in particular NOx, of two advanced aircraft combustor concepts at a simulated high-altitude cruise condition. The two pre-mixed, lean-reaction designs are known as the Jet Induced Circulation (JIC) combustor and the Vortex Air Blast (VAB) combustor and were rig tested in the form of reverse flow can combustors in the 0. 13 ni (5. 0 in.) size range. Various configuration modifications were applied to the JIC and VAB combustor designs in an effort to reduce the emissions levels. The VAB combustor demonstrated a NOx level of 1. 11 gm NO 2 /kg fuel with essentially 100 percent combustion efficiency at the simulated cruise combustor condition of 507 kPa (5 atm), 833 K (1500 <b>R),</b> <b>inlet</b> pressure and temperature respectively, and 1778 K (3200 R) outlet temperature on Jet-Al fuel. These configuration screening tests were carried out on essentially reaction zones only, in order to simplify the construction and modification of the combustors and to uncouple any possible effects on the emissions produced by the dilution flow. Tests were also conducted however at typical engine idle conditions on both combustors equipped with dilution ports in order to better define the problem areas involved in the operation of such concepts over a complete engine operational envelope.

40|$|Purpose: Lung {{protective}} ventilation {{is recommended}} {{in patients with}} acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) needing mechanical ventilation. This can however be associated with hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis, such that extracorporeal CO 2 removal (ECCO 2 R) can be applied. The {{aim of this study}} was to derive optimal operating parameters for the ECCO 2 R Abylcap (R) system (Bellco, Italy). Methods: We included 4 ARDS patients with a partial arterial oxygen tension over the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO 2 /FiO(2)) lower than 150 mmHg, receiving lung-protective ventilation and treated with the Abylcap (R) via a double lumen 13. 5 -Fr dialysis catheter in the femoral vein. Every 24 hours during 5 consecutive days, blood was sampled at the Abylcap (<b>R)</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet for different blood flows (Q(B) : 200 - 300 - 400 mL/min) with 100 % O- 2 gas flow (Q(G)) of 7 L/min, and for different Q(G) (Q(G) : 0. 5 - 1 - 1. 5 - 3 - 6 - 8 L/min) with Q(B) 400 mL/min. CO 2 and O- 2 transfer remained constant over 5 days for a fixed Q(B). Results: We found that, for a fixed Q(G) of 7 L/min, CO 2 transfer linearly and significantly increased with Q(B) (i. e. from 58 +/- 8 to 98 +/- 16 mL/min for Q(B) 200 to 400 mL/min). For a fixed Q(B) of 400 mL/min, CO 2 transfer non-linearly increased with Q(G) (i. e. from 39 +/- 9 to 98 +/- 16 mL/min for Q(G) 0. 5 to 8 L/min) reaching a plateau at Q(G) of 6 L/min. Conclusions: Hence, when using the Abylcap (R) ECCO 2 R in the treatment of ARDS patients the O- 2 flow should be at least 6 L/min while Q(B) should be set at its maximum...|$|E

40|$|The Liquid Transfer Cryogenic Test Facility is a {{versatile}} testbed for ground-based cryogenic fluid storage, handling, and transfer experimentation. The test rig contains two well instrumented tanks, {{and a third}} interchangeable tank, designed to accommodate liquid nitrogen or liquid hydrogen testing. The internal tank volumes are approx. 18, 5, and 1. 2 cu. ft. Tank pressures can be varied from 2 to 30 psia. Preliminary no vent fill tests with nitrogen and hydrogen were successfully completed with the test rig. Initial results indicate that no vent fills of nitrogen above 90 percent full are achievable using this test configuration, in a 1 -g environment, and with inlet liquid temperatures as high as 143 R, and an average tank wall temperature of nearly 300 <b>R.</b> This <b>inlet</b> temperature corresponds to a saturation pressure of 19 psia for nitrogen.

40|$|Experimental {{investigations}} and computer modelling {{studies have been}} made on the refrigerant-water counterflow condenser section of a small air to water heat pump. The main object of the investigation was a comparative study between the computer modelling predictions and the experimental observations {{for a range of}} operating conditions but other characteristics of a counterflow heat exchanger are also discussed. The counterflow condenser consisted of 15 metres of a thermally coupled pair of copper pipes, one containing the R 12 working fluid and the other water flowing in the opposite direction. This condenser was mounted horizontally and folded into 0. 5 metre straight sections. Thermocouples were inserted in both pipes at one metre intervals and transducers for pressure and flow measurement were also included. Data acquisition, storage and analysis was carried out by a micro-computer suitably interfaced with the transducers and thermocouples. Many sets of readings were taken under a variety of conditions, with air temperature ranging from 18 to 26 degrees Celsius, water inlet from 13. 5 to 21. 7 degrees, <b>R</b> 12 <b>inlet</b> temperature from 61. 2 to 81. 7 degrees and water mass flow rate from 6. 7 to 32. 9 grammes per second. A Fortran computer model of the condenser (originally prepared by Carrington[1]) has been modified to match the information available from experimental work. This program uses iterative segmental integration over the desuperheating, mixed phase and subcooled regions for the R 12 working fluid, the water always being in the liquid phase. Methods of estimating the inlet and exit fluid conditions from the available experimental data have been developed for application to the model. Temperature profiles and other parameters have been predicted and compared with experimental values for the condenser for a range of evaporator conditions and have shown that the model gives a satisfactory prediction of the physical behaviour of a simple counterflow heat exchanger in both single phase and two phase regions...|$|R
40|$|Observations on Upper Red Rock Lake {{during periods}} of ice cover in the winters of 1994 - 1995 and 1995 - 1996 {{indicate}} that the lake became severely deficient in dissolved oxygen during the first winter but not the second, and that the distributional behavior of Arctic grayling, Thymallus arcticus. differed markedly between the two winters. During the first winter, dissolved oxygen declined to very low concentrations, generally about 0. 5 to 0. 15 ppm, in midlake and other sampling locations by mid to late January. Dead invertebrates and fish (suckers, Catostomus sp.) were seen at two locations where holes were drilled through the ice for habitat measurements. Two radio-tagged Arctic grayling remained in two small areas with higher oxygen concentrations of about 2. 6 to 10 ppm throughout the period of ice cover.

In contrast, oxygen concentrations remained relatively high, generally above 5 ppm, beneath ice cover through the winter of 1995 - 1996. Radio-tagged fish located by telemetry during this second winter—four Arctic grayling, seven cutthroat trout, and two burbot—remained widely distributed through the lake. Differences in oxygen concentrations beneath ice cover appeared related to conditions which favored greater growth of macrophyte vegetation during the preceding summer and fall, and effects of snow and ice cover on light penetration during winter...|$|R
40|$|PhDThe thesis {{describes}} experiments {{aimed at}} measurement of heat-transfer coefficients for condensation in a multi micro channel tube. Experiments were performed with steam and R 113, fluids chosen {{to cover a}} wide range of thermophysical properties, in particular, surface tension which plays an important role during condensation in small, non-circular channels. The aluminum extruded condenser tube used had cooled length 748 mm and 13 parallel channels each with height 1. 38 mm and width 1. 41 mm. The upper and lower outer surfaces were cooled separately by water in counter flow in channels above and below the test tube. The mass flow rates in the two channels were adjusted to be the same. Coolant temperatures were measured at 17 positions along each of the coolant channels as well as at inlet and exit. An accurate direct measurement of the overall inlet-to-outlet coolant temperature difference was also measured directly with a 10 junction thermopile for each of the two coolant streams with junctions downstream of mixers. Temperatures of the condenser tube wall were measured at 10 positions on each of the upper and lower surfaces using embedded thermocouples. Temperatures and pressures of the vapour were measured in chambers at the inlet and outlet of vapour stream. Pressures were also measured in the condenser channels just upstream and just downstream of the cooled section. Data have been obtained for cases where the vapour was saturated (for both steam and <b>R</b> 113) at <b>inlet.</b> Runs were made for complete and incomplete condensation within the tube.

40|$|In the {{presented}} work, {{it is made}} {{a numerical}} study about the main physical principle of a solar chimney (SCPP – Solar Chimney Power Plant) {{and the influence of}} some geometric parameters on the available power in the SCPP. The main objectives are to test the applicability of the studied numerical model in future studies of SCPP geometric optimization and to test the action of the collector inlet height (H 1) and the chimney outlet diameter (D 2) on the available power of the device. For that it is considered an incompressible, turbulent, steady flow with mixed convective heat transfer in a two-dimensional and axisymmetric domain, similar to the one found in a solar chimney. The conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy are numerically solved using the finite volume method, more specifically with the FLUENT software. The classical turbulence modeling (RANS) was used for the turbulence approach with standard model k – ε. The other geometric parameters: collector radius (<b>R)</b> and the <b>inlet</b> and outlet of the turbine section, R 1 and R 2, are also constant. The verification results indicated a good agreement with those presented in the literature, even using a simplified domain. It was also observed that the H 1 parameter is almost insensitive in the solar chimney performance, whereas the D 2 variable presented great influence in the available power. The best performance was attained for an intermediate value of D 2, D 2 = 0. 44 m. For this value, the available power was almost 72 % and 19 % higher from those obtained in the inferior and superior extremes of the studied D 2 variable, D 2 = 0. 22 m and 0. 88 m, respectively. It was also observed that there is a very good possibility of optimization of the chimney geometry in future studies...|$|R
40|$|The ram jet is {{basically}} {{one of the}} most dimple types of aircraft engine. It consists only of an inlet diffuser, a combustion system, and an exit nozzle. A typical ram-jet configuration is shown in figure 128. The engine operates on the Brayton cycle, and ideal cycle efficiency depends only on the ratio of engine to ambient pressure. The increased, engine pressures are obtained by ram action alone, and for this reason the ram jet has zero thrust at zero speed. Therefore, ram-jet-powered aircraft must be boosted to flight speeds close to a Mach number of 1. 0 before appreciable thrust is generated by the engine. Since pressure increases are obtained by ram action alone, combustor-inlet pressures and temperatures are controlled by the flight speed, the ambient atmospheric condition, and by the efficiency of the inlet diffuser. These pressures and temperatures, as functions of flight speed and altitude, are shown in figure 129 for the NACA standard atmosphere and for practical values of diffuser efficiency. It can be seen that very wide ranges of combustor-inlet temperatures and pressures may be encountered over the ranges of flight velocity and altitude at which ram jets may be operated. Combustor-inlet temperatures from 500 degrees to 1500 degrees <b>R</b> and <b>inlet</b> pressures from 5 to 100 pounds per square inch absolute represent the approximate ranges of interest in current combustor development work. Since the ram jet has no moving parts in the combustor outlet, higher exhaust-gas temperatures than those used in current turbojets are permissible. Therefore, fuel-air ratios equivalent to maximum rates of air specific impulse or heat release can be used, and, for hydrocarbon fuels, this weight ratio is about 0. 070. Lower fuel-air ratios down to about 0. 015 may also be required to permit efficient cruise operation. This fuel-air-ratio range of 0. 015 to 0. 070 used in ram jets can be compared with the fuel-air ratios up to 0. 025 encountered in current turbojets. Ram-jet combustor-inlet velocities range from 150 to 400 feet per second. These high linear velocities combined with the relatively low pressure ratios obtainable in ram jets require that the pressure drop through the combustor be kept low to avoid excessive losses in cycle efficiency. It has been estimated that, for a long-range ram-jet engine, an increase in pressure loss of one dynamic head would require a compensating 1 -percent increase in combustion efficiency. Therefore, combustor pressure-loss coefficients (pressure drop/impact pressure) of the order of 1 to 4 are found in most current engines. The operating conditions described impose major problems in the design of stable and efficient ram-jet combustion systems. This chapter presents a survey of ram-jet combustor research and, where possible, points out criteria that may be useful in the design of ram-jet combustion systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the facing-the-wind sampling efficiency of three personal aerosol samplers as a function of particle phase (solid versus liquid). Samplers examined were the IOM, Button, and a prototype personal high-flow inhalable sampler head (PHISH). The prototype PHISH was designed to interface with the 37 -mm closed-face cassette and provide an inhalable sample at 10 l min(- 1) of flow. Increased flow rate increases the amount of mass collected during a typical work shift and helps to ensure that limits of detection are met, particularly for well-controlled but highly toxic species. Two PHISH prototypes were tested: one with a screened inlet and one with a single-pore open-face inlet. Personal aerosol samplers were tested on a bluff-body disc that was rotated along the facing-the-wind axis to reduce spatiotemporal variability associated with sampling supermicron aerosol in low-velocity wind tunnels. When compared to published data for facing-wind aspiration efficiency for a mouth-breathing mannequin, the IOM oversampled relative to mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency for all sizes and particle types (solid and liquid). The sampling efficiency of the Button sampler was closer to the mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency than the IOM for solid particles, but the screened inlet removed most liquid particles, resulting in a large underestimation compared to the mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency. The open-face PHISH results showed overestimation for solid particles and underestimation for liquid particles when compared to the mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency. Substantial (and statistically significant) differences in sampling efficiency were observed between liquid and solid particles, particularly for the Button and screened-PHISH, with a majority of aerosol mass depositing on the screened inlets of these samplers. Our results suggest that large droplets have low penetration efficiencies through screened inlets and that particle bounce, for solid particles, is an important determinant of aspiration and sampling efficiencies for samplers with screened <b>inlets.</b> <b>R</b> 21 OH 009114 /OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United StatesR 21 OH 009114 /OH/NIOSH CDC HHS/United States 2016 - 03 - 03 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 21965462 PMC 477665...|$|R

Análises estatísticas multivariadas de Agrupamento e Componentes Principais (ACP) foram usadas para agrupar pontos de amostragem com características limnológicas semelhantes; RESULTADOS: Na ACP com dados de concentração foi retido 90. 52 % da variabilidade dos dados, correlacionando a entrada IB com altas concentrações de condutividade, alcalinidade, pH, TC, nutrientes e sólidos. Para os dados de carga a ACP reteve 80. 9 % da variabilidade dos dados e correlacionou os pontos IA D, IA R e OUT R com elevada DBO 5, clorofila-a, STD, nitrato, nitrito, P-total, temperatura, oxigênio e vazão. As maiores taxas de eficiência de remoção ocorreram na seca, principalmente em concentração, com 78 % para amônia, 95. 5 % para SRP, 94. 9 % para STS e 99. 9 % para TC; CONCLUSÕES: O "wetland" foi eficiente na remoção de nutrientes, sólidos, DBO 5, clorofila-a e TC, principalmente no período seco. Reestruturações do sistema para aumentar o tempo de residência durante as chuvas e um pré-tratamento dos resíduos de biodigestores, podem aumentar a retenção de nutrientes e sólidos pelo wetland...|$|R

The field studies were carried out in the Ria Formosa, a multi-inlet barrier island system located in southern Portugal. Long Term Studies: The four natural inlets of the Ria Formosa were studied for the period between the 1940 ’s and 1996. Inlet width and position of the inlet channel were determined using a series of vertical aerial photos and charts. The objective was to determine the association between inlet migration patterns and different hydrodynamic conditions, major storms and engineering interventions. Results indicate that natural inlet opening and evolution were mainly affected by three factors: (a) the existence of sub-embayments (western and eastern) inside the system, (b) exposure to wave energy, and (c) inlet efficiency. Two distinctive eastward migration patterns were found by analysing the correlation coefficient (<b>r)</b> between <b>inlet</b> width evolution and inlet migration and by the comparison of the shape of the curves fitted to the inlet migration behaviour. Typical migration of the high-energy flank is characterised by an initial stage of readjustment, with low migration rates, followed by a stage of high eastward migration rates, up to a limiting position. Inlet width remains reasonably constant during the entire migration cycle, thus the correlation between inlet width and position is very low. Typical inlets on the low-energy flank are formed by barrier breaching during major storms and produce, initially, very wide inlets. Eastward inlet migration on the low-energy flank follows a natural logarithmic curve where channel migration is accompanied by strong constructional processes on the updrift barrier. Due to subsequent inlet width reductions, the correlation between inlet width and position is significant. Medium Term Studies: A monitoring program, including the acquisition of a series of topo-bathymetric surveys and oblique aerial photos, has been carried out at Anc˜ao Inlet since its artificial opening in June 1997. The results (morphologic and volumetric) were analysed with relation to the prevailing oceanographic conditions. This allowed the development of a conceptual evolutionary model for the natural evolution of artificially opened inlets with 4 stages: Stage 1 is the artificially opened inlet; Stage 2 represents the inlet after reaching dynamic equilibrium for the channel and while it is developing the deltas; Stage 3 is the mature migrating inlet; and Stage PS (Post-Storm) is the inlet situation after high-energy conditions. Transition between stages 1 to 3 is a continuous process with intermediate sub-stages. Transition to Stage PS is a discrete phenomenon, caused by high-energy events, after which the inlet continuously changes back to the previous stage. Short Term Studies: Three sediment transport studies using tracers were performed at Anc˜ao Inlet. The objectives of the experiments were to determine and understand the sediment transport pathways and magnitudes on the updrift margin of an inlet. In order to apply the traditionally used Space Integration Methodology to the tracer experiments, some adaptations had to be made. The division of the study area into morphologically defined sectors was found to be a key factor for the applicability of tracers in such a complex area. Therefore, 4 sectors were defined: Sector A representing the straight part of the updrift beach; Sector B being the upper area of the swash platform; Sector C being the lower area of the swash platform; and Sector D representing the inner parts of the inlet margin. The integrated study of all data (wind, waves, currents, tracer distribution and topographic evolution) led to the determination of the sediment pathways. Three tidal stages (TS), associated with distinctive sediment transport patterns, were found to occur at the inlet margin during each tidal cycle: TS 1 implies flooding currents, and thus, transport towards the inside of the inlet area, both on the swash platform and the inner parts of the inlet area; during TS 2 flooding currents transporting sediments towards the inlet occur on the swash platform whilst the interaction of the flooding currents with the flood delta produces the development of an anticlockwise internal gyre (IG) that results in ebbing currents occurring in the inner inlet margin; TS 3 implies ebbing transport both in the inner margin and the swash platform. Evidence of the existence of a clockwise external gyre (EG) on the swash platform was found. A semi-quantitative conceptual model was developed in order to explain the sediment transport pathways and magnitudes that a known mass of sediment would follow after arriving at the swash platform. It was found that the areas with the largest sediment accumulation were Sector B and C, whilst almost no sediment was retained in Sector D which underwent strong erosive processes. According to the model only 48 % of the initial mass of sediments are still in the system after two tidal cycles. It is hypothesised that sediment losses are due to sediment transport towards the ebb delta and to sediment by-passing occurring from the ebb delta to the downdrift beach through swash bar processes. The herein defined conceptual model represents a useful tool that could be applied to other tidal inlets under similar conditions, facilitating sediment budget studies around tidal inlets. Inlet Relocation Assessment: Two inlets were relocated in the Ria Formosa and were the subject of a monitoring program that included the acquisition of quantitative (topo-bathymetric surveys) data. The data obtained from the monitoring program were analysed together with the wave climate and then compared with historical information on the natural inlets, in order to assess the degree of success of the relocation actions. One of the relocations studied, Anc˜ao Inlet, was considered to be successful even though an initial unexpected behaviour produced some material damage to property. On the contrary, the relocation of Fuzeta Inlet, did not have the expected results and the new inlet was effected by the same problems as the old one. It was found that the most important factor for a relocation action to succeed is the correct choice of the location of the opening. A theoretical procedure to enhance the possibilities of relocation success is suggested: (1) Hydrodynamic studies are needed in order to determine if the present conditions are similar to the historical ones. (2) The position for the inlet opening is chosen according to the hydrodynamic conditions but there are other factors to be taken into account, i. e., the historical migration paths and typical inlet width of the natural inlet; the hydrodynamics of the backbarrier; the morphology of the backbarrier and, for multi-inlet barrier island systems, the proximity to adjacent inlets. (3) Once the position is chosen, environmental impact studies should be made in order to assess the risk of the relocation for the ecosystems of the area. Only if the environmental impact studies are favourable, should a relocation action be performed. European Marine Sicience and Technology ProgramFundação para a Ciência e Tecnologi...|$|R
