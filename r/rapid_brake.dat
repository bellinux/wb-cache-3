40|$|Abstract. The <b>rapid</b> <b>braking</b> on {{the white}} dwarf in the close binary AE Aqr can be {{explained}} in terms of the pulsar mechanism provided the magnetic moment of the star µ> ∼ 1. 4 × 10 34 Gcm 3. Under this condition the magnetic field is strong enough to prevent accretion with the rate ∼ Pcr ≃ 20 s. When the period had decreased beyond Pcr the white dwarf lost its angular momentum via the gravitational waves that caused strong differential rotation. The magnetic field inside the star was winding up on a time scale of a month up to ∼ 10 8 – 10 9 G. This field manifests itself at the surface due to buoyant instability producing a surface field of 10 7 – 10 8 G. As a result the white dwarf changed its initial accretor state to the presently observed ejector state, i. e. it is spinning down predominantly due to the magneto-dipole waves generation and particle acceleration...|$|R
40|$|The spin-down {{power of}} the white dwarf in the close binary AE Aquarii {{significantly}} exceeds the bolometric luminosity of the system. The interpretation of this phenomenon {{in terms of the}} gravitational-wave emitter mechanism has been recently suggested by Choi & Yi. The basic assumption of their interpretation is that the spatially limited blobs or mounds of mass deltam similar to 10 (- 3) M. are present at the magnetic poles of the white dwarf. We show that the mounds of this mass can be confined by the magnetic field of the white dwarf only if the dipole magnetic moment of the star exceeds 4 x 10 (37) G cm(3). Under these conditions, however, the magnetodipole losses of the white dwarf would exceed the evaluated spin-down power by 6 orders of magnitude. On this basis, we discard the possibility that the observed <b>rapid</b> <b>braking</b> of the white dwarf in AE Aqr can be explained in terms of the mechanism proposed by Choi Yi...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The spindown {{power of}} the compact {{companion}} in the close binary system AE Aqr essentially exceeds the bolometrical luminosity of the system. The interpretation of this phenomenon under various assumptions about {{the state and the}} nature of the primary companion is discussed. It is shown that the <b>rapid</b> <b>braking</b> on the compact companion of AE Aqr can be explained in terms of the pulsar mechanism provided the magnetic moment of the compact star µ> ∼ 1. 4 × 10 34 Gcm 3, that implies a magnetic field strength at the surface of the white dwarf of about 50 MG. Under this condition the spindown power is used predominantly for the generation of magnetodipole waves and particle acceleration. A stream-fed, diskless mass-exchange picture with the average rate of mass transfer ˙M ∼ (0. 5 ÷ 5) × 10 17 gs − 1 is expected in the frame of the suggested model. Similarity of some properties of the X-ray emission observed from AE Aqr and canonical radio pulsars in the ROSAT energy range (e. g. the power law spectrum of pulsing component with α ≈− 2 and the ratio LX/Lsd ∼ 10 − 3) allows to suggest common mechanisms of particle acceleration and the polar cap heating in these systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{observed}} {{properties of}} the close binary AE Aqr indicate that the mass transfer in this system operates via the Roche lobe overflow mechanism, but the material transferred from the normal companion is neither accreted {{onto the surface of}} the white dwarf nor stored in a disk around its magnetosphere. As previously shown, such a situation can be realized if the white dwarf operates as a propeller. At the same time, the efficiency of the propeller action by the white dwarf is insufficient to explain the <b>rapid</b> <b>braking</b> of the white dwarf, which implies that the spin-down power is in excess of the bolometric luminosity of the system. To avoid this problem we have simulated the mass-transfer process in AE Aqr assuming that the observed braking of the white dwarf is governed by a pulsar-like spin-down mechanism. We show that the expected Hα Doppler tomogram in this case resembles the tomogram observed from the system. We find that the agreement between the simulated and the observed tomograms is rather good provided the mean value of the mass-transfer rate ∼ 5 × 10 16 g s − 1. Three spatially separated sources of Hα emission can be distinguished within this approach. The structure of the tomogram depends on the relative contributions of these sources to the Hα emission and is expected to vary from night to night.

KOI- 428 was established as a hot Jupiter transiting the largest and the most evolved star discovered so far and is described by Santerne et al. (2011 a). KOI- 410 does not present radial velocity change greater than 120 m/s, which allows us to exclude at 3 sigma a transiting companion heavier than 3. 4 Mjup. KOI- 552 b appears to be a transiting low-mass star with a mass ratio of 0. 15. KOI- 423 b is a new transiting companion in the overlapping region between massive planets and brown dwarfs. With a radius of 1. 22 +- 0. 11 Rjup and a mass of 18. 0 +- 0. 92 Mjup, KOI- 423 b is orbiting an F 7 IV star with a period of 21. 0874 +- 0. 0002 days and an eccentricity of 0. 12 +- 0. 02. From the four selected Kepler candidates, at least three of them have a Jupiter-size transiting companion, but two of them are not in the mass domain of Jupiter-like planets. KOI- 423 b and KOI- 522 b are members of a growing population of known massive companions orbiting close to an F-type star.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many quadrupedal species stand bipedally {{on their}} hindlimbs to fight. This posture {{may provide a}} {{performance}} advantage by allowing the forelimbs to strike an opponent with the range of motion that is intrinsic to high-speed running, jumping, <b>rapid</b> <b>braking</b> and turning; the range of motion over which peak force and power can be produced. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To test the hypothesis that bipedal (i. e., orthograde) posture provides a performance advantage when striking with the forelimbs, I measured the force and energy produced when human subjects struck from "quadrupedal" (i. e., pronograde) and bipedal postures. Downward and upward directed striking energy was measured with a custom designed pendulum transducer. Side and forward strikes were measured with a punching bag instrumented with an accelerometer. When subjects struck downward from a bipedal posture the work was 43. 70 ± 12. 59 % (mean ± S. E.) greater than when they struck from a quadrupedal posture. Similarly, 47. 49 ± 17. 95 % more work was produced when subjects struck upward from a bipedal stance compared to a quadrupedal stance. Importantly, subjects did 229. 69 ± 44. 19 % more work in downward than upward directed strikes. During side and forward strikes the force impulses were 30. 12 ± 3. 68 and 43. 04 ± 9. 00 % greater from a bipedal posture than a quadrupedal posture, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results indicate that bipedal posture does provide a performance advantage for striking with the forelimbs. The mating systems of great apes are characterized by intense male-male competition in which conflict is resolved through force or the threat of force. Great apes often fight from bipedal posture, striking with both the fore- and hindlimbs.

40|$|Handling, loading, {{transport}} time and unloading in connection to transport of farm animals affect animal welfare. Induced effects include both psychological and physiological stress responses in animals. The physiological parameters may be measured through blood analysis while behavioural changes often manifest themselves through increased vocalisation, escape attempts and apathy. Physiological parameters are additional parameters of importance when measuring animal stress responses. The handlers behavior during transport {{has been shown}} to have major impact on animal welfare and the quality of meat. Animal friendly handling and driving of animals create a more manageable work environment for the handlers. To further increase animal welfare in connection to transport, stables should be built with well adapted drift passage and ramps on the transport vehicle. Well adapted stables and transport vehicles significantly reduces animal stress, harm and mortality. This will effect sizeable economic benefit to farmers, slaughterhouses and consumers. Stables and transport vehicles should be equipped with sufficient lighting as animals commonly exhibit aversion to darkness and prefer moving from a darker to a brighter space. Lighting should be directed so it never falls straight into the eyes of animals and in a way shadows on the ground are kept at a minimum as not to scare animals from moving. When constructing vehicle ramps it’s important {{to take into account the}} ramp inclination, width, side walls and paving material. Another important factor is the formation of new animal groups in connection to transport. New group constellations should be avoided as it causes social stress amongst herd animals. Regrouping animals creates new hierarkies which can result in physical damage to the animals. Driving style also impacts animal welfare as the driving style affects risk of animal injury, balance and ability to rest during transport. Vehicle speed, <b>rapid</b> <b>braking</b> and acceleration, gear change and driving at high speed on winding roads has most significant effect. In conclusion there is a wide variety of factors affecting animal welfare in connection to transport. Above mentioned factors should be taken into account simultaneously as they all affect animal welfare...|$|R

However, the finding that the He-strong CP star HR 7355 is a rapid rotator complicates this concept. Our goal is to explain the observed behaviour of HR 7355 based on period analysis of all available photometry. Over two years, we acquired 114 new BV observations of HR 7355 at observatories in Arizona, U. S. A and Cape Town, South Africa. We performed period analyses of the new observations along with new analyses of 732 archival measurements from the Hipparcos and ASAS projects. We find that the light curves of HR 7355 in various filters are quite similar, with amplitudes 0. 035 (4), 0. 036 (4), and 0. 038 (3) mag in B, Hp and V, respectively. The light curves are double-peaked, with unevenly deep minima. We substantially refine the rotational period to be P= 0. 5214410 (4) d, indicating that HR 7355 is the most rapidly rotating CP star known. Our period analyses reveal a possible lengthening of the rotational period with dP/dt/P = 2. 4 (8) x 10 ^- 6 /yr. We conclude that the shape and amplitude of HR 7355 light curves are typical of magnetic He-strong CP stars, for which light variations are the result of photospheric spots on the surface of a rotating star. We hypothesise that the light variations are caused mainly by an uneven distribution of overabundant helium on the star's surface.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} assessing {{the performance of}} a hybrid electric power-train is to construct a backward-facing model of the vehicle and then to exercise that model over a number of different legislative and ‘real-world’ drive cycles. Because of the low rates of acceleration and braking associated with such drive cycles, the effect of tyre dynamics on vehicle performance and powertrain efficiency, including that of regenerative braking, have been generally ignored in previous studies. Contained within this paper is the design of a detailed mathematical, physics-based model of a lightweight fuel-cell hybrid sports vehicle. The model is appropriate for studying the dynamic performance of the powertrain during periods of high acceleration and regenerative braking that are commensurate {{with the use of the}} vehicle as a sports car. The model characterizes both the electrical subsystems within the powertrain and the mechanical components including the longitudinal dynamics of the tyres. Simulation results show that, during <b>rapid</b> acceleration and <b>braking,</b> the effect of tyre losses on the performance and energy efficiency of the powertrain cannot be neglected.

40|$|Compression {{ignition}} engine technologies have been advanced {{in the past}} decade to provide superior fuel economy and high performance. These technologies offer increased opportunities for optimizing engine calibration. Current engine calibration methods rely on deriving static tabular relationships between a set of steady-state operating points and the corresponding values of the controllable variables. While the engine is running, these values are being interpolated for each engine operating point to coordinate optimal performance criteria, e. g., fuel economy, emissions, and acceleration. These methods, however, are not efficient in capturing transient engine operation designated by common driving habits, e. g., stop-and-go driving, <b>rapid</b> acceleration, and <b>braking.</b> An alternative approach was developed recently, which makes the engine an autonomous intelligent system, namely, one capable of learning its optimal calibration for both steady-state and transient operating points in real time. Through this approach, while the engine is running the vehicle, it progressively perceives the driver’s driving style and eventually learns to operate in a manner that optimizes specified performance criteria. The major challenge to this approach is problem dimensionality when more than one controllable variable is considered. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a decentralized learning control scheme. The scheme is evaluated through simulation of a diesel engine model, which learns the values of injection timing and variable geometry turbocharging vane position that optimize fuel economy and pollutant emissions over a segment of the FTP- 75 driving cycle. �DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 3019331 �...|$|R
40|$|The cheetah {{is capable}} of {{incredible}} feats of manoeuvrability. But, what is interesting about these manoeuvres is that they involve rapid swinging of the animal's lengthy tail. Despite this, very little is understood about the cheetah tail and its motion, with the common view being that it is "heavy" and possibly used as a "counter balance" or as a "rudder". In this dissertation, this subject is investigated by exploring the motions of the cheetah tail by means of mathematic al models, feedback control and novel robot platforms. Particularly, the motion in the roll axis is first investigated and it is determined that it assists stability of high speed turns. This is validated by modelling and experimental testing on a novel tailed robot, Dima I. Inspired by cheetah video observations, the tail motion in the pitch axis during <b>rapid</b> acceleration and <b>braking</b> manoeuvres is also investigated. Once again modelling and experimental testing on a tailed robot are performed and the tail is shown to stabilise rapid acceleration manoeuvres. Video observations also indicate the tail movement {{in the shape of}} a cone: a combination of pitching and yawing. Understanding this motion is done by setting up an optimization problem. Here, the optimal motion was found to be to a cone which results in a continuous torque on the body during a turn while galloping. A novel two degree of freedom tailed robot, Dima II, was then developed to experimentally validate the effect of this motion. Lastly, measurement of the cheetah tail inertia was performed during a routine necropsy where it was found to have lower inertia than assumed. However, the tail has thick, long fur that was tested in a wind tunnel. Here it was found that the furry tail {{is capable of}} producing significant drag forces without a weight penalty.
