40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} design and {{realization}} {{of a new}} mass flow sensor using the Peltier effect. The sensor, shaped as a bimetallic circuit includes two continuous parallel strips coated {{with a great deal}} of metal plated spots. In such a device, one track performs as a classical thermoelectrical circuitry whose both plated and uncoated parts provide the thermopile junctions. The other strip is subjected to electrical current so as to generate numerous small thermal gradients owing to the Peltier effect. Then, the resulting differences in temperature induce a Seebeck e. m. f. detected by the other strip acting as a receiver. The thermal coupling between transmitter and receiver tracks depends on many variation of the surrounding environment heat transfer coefficient. Therefore, such a device allows us to detect any shift in physical properties related to the apparent thermal conductivity. In special case of a steady state fluid, the induced e. m. f. in the <b>receiving</b> <b>track</b> hinges on the thermal conductivity. When the fluid is in relative motion along the sensor, the velocity can be read out as a funotion of voltage as an application, the sensor is placed into a tube conducting a fluid flow, in order to design a new mass flowmeter...|$|E

40|$|Traditionally, the American {{child welfare}} system {{intervenes}} in cases of evident and severe maltreatment. Families in need of help, but who have not reached a crisis, are excluded from typical services. Some suggest that if these families were served, few would be rereferred to the {{child welfare system}}. California 2 ̆ 7 s Differential Response (DR) has three tracks, of which 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 Track 12 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 targets families screened out of child protective services (CPS) and refers them to agencies that provide voluntary, home-based services and referrals. This study examined child-welfare trajectories for families <b>receiving</b> <b>Track</b> 1 DR services in one California county. Using survival analysis, treatment group children (N = 134) were compared to children eligible for services but denied due to program capacity (comparison group N = 511). Findings suggest {{no statistically significant differences}} between groups on the likelihood of a re-report following program participation, timing of maltreatment reports, or report investigations. The ability to draw strong conclusions from this study, however, is limited by selection bias because prior child maltreatment reports were more common in the treatment group. The intervention may provide families with important supports, but evidence for maltreatment prevention may not be supported. Future studies should examine potential effects on a range of family domains...|$|E
50|$|The PRR {{rebuilt the}} {{component}} yards and installed automatic retarders, {{starting with the}} eastbound hump in 1938. The eastbound yard was electrified with 11,000-volt alternating current (AC) service. (See Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system.) The westbound complex was rebuilt in 1944 with 16 <b>receiving</b> <b>tracks</b> and 35 classification tracks, followed by the eastbound complex, reconfiguring to 15 <b>receiving</b> <b>tracks</b> and 33 classification tracks. The average daily traffic load in 1939 was 11,207 cars, and this average increased during the approach of World War II, with 14,100 daily cars in October 1941. The record traffic level at the yard was 20,660 cars in one day during June 1943.|$|R
