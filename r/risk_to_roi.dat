40|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging has significant potential {{in the study and}} treatment of neurological disorders and stroke. Region of interest (ROI) analysis in such studies allows for testing of strong a priori clinical hypotheses with improved statistical power. A commonly used automated approach <b>to</b> <b>ROI</b> analysis is <b>to</b> spatially normalize each participant’s structural brain image to a template brain image and define ROIs using an atlas. However, in studies of individuals with structural brain lesions such as stroke, the gold standard approach may be <b>to</b> manually hand-draw <b>ROIs</b> on each participant’s non-normalized structural brain image. Automated approaches <b>to</b> <b>ROI</b> analysis are faster and more standardized, yet are susceptible to preprocessing error (e. g., normalization error) that can be greater in lesioned brains. The manual approach <b>to</b> <b>ROI</b> analysis has high demand for time and expertise but may provide a more accurate estimate of brain response. In this study, we directly compare commonly used automated and manual approaches <b>to</b> <b>ROI</b> analysis by reanalyzing data from a previously published hypothesis-driven cognitive fMRI study involving individuals with stroke. The ROI evaluated is the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus. We found a significant difference in task-related effect size and percent activated voxels in this ROI between the automated and manual approaches <b>to</b> <b>ROI</b> analysis. Task interactions, however, were consistent across ROI analysis approaches. These findings support the use of automated approaches <b>to</b> <b>ROI</b> analysis in studies of lesioned brains, provided they employ a task interaction design...|$|R

40|$|The genes encoded by the RD 1 locus {{are known}} to be {{important}} for intracellular survival of pathogenic mycobacterium, however their role in counteracting host defense is not known. I hypothesize that RD 1 is involved in counteracting host oxidative response by secreting ROI-neutralizing enzymes such as catalase and superoxide dismutase. In support of this hypothesis I have shown that M. marinum RD 1 mutants are more sensitive than wild type <b>to</b> <b>ROIs</b> both in vitro and in BMDM. Western blot analysis on the KatG protein levels within the bacterial cells grown in 7 H 9 rich medium demonstrated that wild type bacteria produced significantly higher amount of KatG than the RD 1 mutants. When the bacteria were exposed for 2 hours to H 2 O 2, wild type showed a significant reduction of the KatG level, while the RD 1 mutants maintained constant levels of KatG, suggesting that RD 1 genes might be involved in the secretion of KatG upon exposure to H 2 O 2. These results together demonstrate an important unknown function of RD 1 in resistance <b>to</b> <b>ROIs...</b>|$|R
40|$|We present {{two methods}} for {{protecting}} {{a region of}} interest (ROI) in a compressed medical image transmitted across a lossy packet network such as the Internet or a wireless channel. We begin with a high quality wavelet-based coder, the Set Partitioning in Hierarchical Trees (SPIHT) algorithm, which orders data progressively by coding the globally important information first. We then compress the <b>ROI</b> <b>to</b> a higher quality {{than the rest of}} the image by scaling the wavelet coefficients corresponding <b>to</b> the <b>ROI.</b> This approach moves ROI information earlier in the bit stream. Finally, we add more redundancy <b>to</b> the <b>ROI</b> than <b>to</b> the rest of the image by two techniques. With MD-SPIHT, we repeat wavelet coefficient trees corresponding <b>to</b> the <b>ROI</b> and code them to higher bit rates than the background trees. With ULP-FEC, we use forward error correction (FEC) in an unequal loss protection framework. We find that both methods increase the probability of receiving high quality ROI in the presence of packet loss...|$|R
