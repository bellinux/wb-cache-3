5|$|King Philip V and Frederick IV of Denmark paid Violante Beatrice visits in 1703 and 1709, respectively. The former {{chose to}} ignore {{the other members of}} the Tuscan Royal Family and reluctantly deigned only speak to her. The latter, on the other hand, was taken with Violante, going as far as to refuse to leave the <b>room</b> <b>while</b> she was {{changing}} clothes.|$|E
5|$|The Jena Six {{were six}} black {{teenagers}} in Jena, Louisiana, {{convicted in the}} 2006 beating of Justin Barker, a white student at the local Jena High School, which they also attended. Barker was injured on December 4, 2006, {{by the members of}} the Jena Six, and received treatment at an emergency <b>room.</b> <b>While</b> the case was pending, it was often cited by some media commentators as an example of racial injustice in the United States. Some commentators believed that the defendants had been charged initially with too-serious offenses and had been treated unfairly.|$|E
5|$|The keep {{was inside}} the inner bailey and {{contained}} the king's accommodation. It had two rooms: an antechamber and an audience <b>room.</b> <b>While</b> Allen Brown interpreted the audience room as the king's chamber, historian Liddiard believes it is probably a throne room. A throne room emphasises the political importance of the castle. In England there is nothing similar to Château Gaillard's keep, but there are buildings with a similar design in France in the 12th and 13th centuries.|$|E

Director Singh also drew inspiration from the Italian painter Caravaggio and the video is laden with religious imagery such as Saint Sebastian, the Biblical episode of the Incredulity of Thomas and Hindu deities, portrayed in a series of tableaux.|$|E
5|$|After his arrest, Edwards {{was imprisoned}} in the Tombs, New York City's jail. When he was arrested, {{he had more}} than $44,000 in a trunk in his <b>room.</b> <b>While</b> in jail {{awaiting}} trial, Edwards forged a letter alleging he had funds in New Orleans, and then showed the letter {{to one of his}} lawyers in order to reassure the lawyer about Edwards' ability to pay for legal counsel. In an attempt to delay his trial, Edwards also forged a letter from a supposed witness, Charles Johnson, stating that he was in Cuba and {{would not be able to}} come and testify for Edwards for a while; this gained Edwards a three-month delay.|$|E
5|$|After the Boss rescues Kinzie {{from her}} nightmare, she devises {{a plan to}} crash the simulation, which will force the Zin to draw power from their ship to keep it running, thus {{weakening}} the ship itself and creating an opening for the Saints to enter. Working together, the remaining Saints manage to overload the simulation, shutting it down just as the Boss escapes. Assaulting Zinyak's ship, the Boss finds power armor emulating the powers {{they had in the}} simulation, and confronts Zinyak in his throne <b>room.</b> <b>While</b> the entire Zin Empire watches, Zinyak and the Boss battle each other. With help from the Saints, the Boss kills Zinyak by tearing his head off and emerges victorious. Impressed, the Zin forces surrender to the Boss, who becomes the new head of the Zin Empire.|$|E

Laura asks Tony's dresser, Kirstie, what he earns, before opening Tony's payslip to see for herself. She is determined for Jim to appear as Macbeth, which {{would allow them to}} save for their wedding. Laura cuts herself on a pin that Kirstie left in the Lady Macbeth dress, and after she and Kirstie leave the room, Jim sees a drop of blood on the floor grow into a large puddle. When he looks again, it has gone.|$|E
5|$|During gunnery {{training}} on 5 May, {{there was a}} premature detonation in the left gun of Hyūgas Turret No. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen. Both aft magazines were flooded to douse the resulting fire and save the ship. She received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple 25mm gun mounts were positioned. On 11 May a valve in Ises No. 2 engine room stuck {{in the open position}} and flooded the engine <b>room.</b> <b>While</b> under repair at Kure, both ships received prototype Type 21 radars. Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the 2nd Battleship Division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, {{at the same time that}} most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI).|$|E

5|$|A detective named Havez (Dwight McFee) {{takes over}} as Bruckman's guard when Mulder and Scully {{are called to}} {{investigate}} yet another new murder victim: the tarot card reader. As they leave they bump into a bellhop who is delivering food to Bruckman's room. The bellhop is actually the killer, and when he enters the <b>room</b> (<b>while</b> Havez is in the washroom), he is delighted to discover that Bruckman has been brought right to where he works. As {{he is about to}} kill Bruckman, Havez re-enters and the killer attacks and kills him instead. Meanwhile, Scully finds the same silk fiber at the new crime scene, and realizing that the bellhop had it on his tray, deduces that he is the murderer. They rush back to the hotel. Mulder chases the killer to the basement kitchen and the scene plays out as described in Bruckman's earlier premonition, but when the killer attacks Mulder, Scully arrives {{in the nick of time}} and shoots him—what Bruckman had seen was the dying killer's last thoughts, not Mulder's death.|$|E
5|$|After a {{conversion}} {{by his mother}} Mary and older sister Susannah in 1798, all of Hinde's family, including his father, converted to Christianity as Methodists. Thomas delayed a while. Shortly afterward the younger Hinde became close friends with Francis Asbury, who became a prominent bishop in the church. Hinde later described the conversion of his youngest sister, Martha Harrison Hinde, in an 1827 article published in the Methodist Review under his pen name, Theophilus Arminius. Hinde recounted Bishop Asbury visiting his father's home in 1803 and telling Martha that she had better find God, because before he could meet her again she would be dead. The bishop's prophecy came true when Martha died in 1811 without having seen Asbury again. Hinde said she had converted before her death and tried to convert the nonbelievers in the <b>room</b> <b>while</b> on her deathbed. He shared a letter in which his sister had tried to convert her close friends. Hinde named his first daughter after his late sister Martha. Hinde did not immediately convert but attended Methodist camp meetings of the period. During his life, he frequently wrote {{about the importance of}} the camp meeting in bringing Christianity and democracy to the west.|$|E
5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the <b>room,</b> <b>while</b> simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E

5|$|As the Britannia Restaurant {{takes up}} the full width of the ship on two decks, a 'tween deck, called Deck 3L, was devised to allow {{passengers}} to walk from the Grand Lobby to the Queen's Room without traversing the dining room mid-meal. The deck consists of two corridors that run beneath the upper balcony of the restaurant on Deck 3, and above the main dining area on Deck 2. This is why the balcony of the Britannia has tiers that step up towards the hull. This arrangement is illustrated on the hull {{where there is a}} stack of three rows of windows in the area where the main restaurant sits, the two upper and lower most rows illuminate the dining <b>room,</b> <b>while</b> the centre row serves Deck 3L. There is a similar arrangement through the Royal Court Theatre. As well, the passages that run on either side of Illuminations on Deck 3 ramp upwards to compensate for the change in deck elevation between the entrance to Illuminations and an elevator bank forward of the room.|$|E
5|$|Despite McDonald's close involvement, the xx {{had been}} {{encouraged}} to self-produce their album by Russell; he believed it would remain faithful to both the band's distinctive live sound and the DIY ethic practiced at XL since its beginnings as a rave label. Smith was chosen {{by the rest of}} the group to produce xx. He used Logic 8 recording software on his Mac Pro and often worked late nights in a nearby conference <b>room</b> <b>while</b> they recorded in the studio with drafts of his beats. Smith produced rhythm tracks with an Akai MPC sampler, which he occasionally processed through a Roland RE-201 and other effects units. He also created click tracks for the rest of the band to keep timing when they recorded their individual parts. After those parts had been recorded, he refined and incorporated his beats into the songs for three to four weeks. Croft trusted that Smith, who did not want to conceal any imperfections by overproducing xx, would make it practical for them to perform live rather than layer the songs with several guitar or vocal elements.|$|E
5|$|Division 11 {{arrived at}} Con Son Island on 29 July taking shelter from heavy seas and monsoon rains that had {{developed}} during the transit. Point Banks was the only cutter to have engine problems during the transit and repairs {{were made in the}} cramped engine <b>room</b> <b>while</b> underway so that no time was lost by the division during transit. During the lay over at Con Son minor repairs were made and repainting was completed on some of the cutters' hulls which had been partially stripped of paint by the storm. Three RVN liaison officers reported aboard the cutters just before the division departed for Phu Quoc Island and the same three cutters started patrol work {{as the rest of the}} division put into Phu Quoc harbor on 31 July. On 30 July operational control of all Market Time elements, whether U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard or RVN, was transferred to the Commander, Task Force 115 (TF115).|$|E

5|$|In the Dunphy household, Alex (Ariel Winter) and Haley (Sarah Hyland) {{are furious}} at Manny (Rico Rodriguez) and Luke (Nolan Gould) for barging into their <b>room</b> <b>while</b> they were changing. This leads to their mother, Claire (Julie Bowen) {{to yell at}} them, while their dad, Phil (Ty Burrell) {{attempts}} to push himself away from Claire's anger behind her back. Annoyed, Claire confronts Phil about how he always makes her play the 'bad cop' role in their family and keeps the 'good cop' role for himself. He reluctantly agrees to switch roles with her. Claire takes Manny and Luke go-carting (although Phil had been quite keen to go), while Phil has to stay and make the girls clean their bathroom. The go-carting goes horribly as Claire, trying to be fun, crashes her cart into the boys, and makes them order large quantities of food. While driving home, Luke gets sick from drinking a milkshake he did not want. Meanwhile, Phil goes berserk when the girls lie to him about cleaning the bathroom and jump on their car {{to stop them from}} leaving, before forcing them to clean the bathroom under his direct supervision and then he had them clean his bathroom. That evening, Phil and Claire admit that they cannot handle each other's natural parent roles, and agree to go back to normal.|$|E
5|$|Major venues for concerts include BIC, Pavilion Theatre and O2 Academy. Built in 1984, the BIC is also {{a popular}} place for party {{political}} conferences and {{has been used by}} all three major political parties. Its four auditoria make it the largest venue on the south coast. The O2 and Pavilion are older and are both Grade II listed buildings. The O2, which opened in 1895 as the Grand Pavilion Theatre, was initially used as a circus and later for music hall theatre. The Pavilion opened in 1929 as concert hall and tea <b>room</b> <b>while</b> also providing a venue for the municipal orchestra. It continues to provide traditional entertainment today, presenting West End stage shows, ballet and operas. Bournemouth has more than 200 listed buildings, mainly from the Victorian and Edwardian eras, including three grade I churches; St Peter's, St Clement's and St Stephen's.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} for {{the film}} began on November 7, 2007 and culminated on March 27, 2008; however second unit filming occurred in Bakersfield, California in April 2008, which stood in for Kirk's childhood home in Iowa. Filming was also done at the City Hall of Long Beach, California; the San Rafael Swell in Utah; and the California State University, Northridge in Los Angeles (which was used for establishing shots of students at Starfleet Academy). A parking lot outside Dodger Stadium {{was used for the}} ice planet of Delta Vega and the Romulan drilling rig on Vulcan. The filmmakers expressed an interest in Iceland for scenes on Delta Vega, but decided against it: Chambliss enjoyed the challenge of filming scenes with snow in southern California. Other Vulcan exteriors were shot at Vasquez Rocks, a location that was used in various episodes of the original series. A Budweiser plant in Van Nuys was used for Enterprises engine <b>room,</b> <b>while</b> a Long Beach power plant was used for Kelvins engine room.|$|E
