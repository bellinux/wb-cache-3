Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd have {{somebody}} write out a chord sheet for us, {{and then we went}} in and figured it out on the date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way we used to do the Beatles. John [...] and I would write a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about. They'd work it out right there in the room".|$|E

Stölzl's reworked storyboard featured Manson as an android clone who kills her human counterpart, a concept the band also liked. He provided a special-effects company with sketches of the android, and a replica was constructed with aircraft and missile parts, tubing, metal and plastic. The android was combined with Manson in post-production to show its mechanical interior. [...] "It <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Man Who Knew Too Much. Some of the shots look like Stanley Kubrick", recalled Vig. [...] "For us it was just important that the music video was also a Garbage video." [...] " [...] like a mini-Bond action-packed film, where an android removes evil from the world and sacrifices herself in the process like a kamikaze warrior. That's as close as we'll ever get ," [...] Manson later said.|$|E

This includes a scene in the season11 episode [...] "Saddlesore Galactica", which shows Duncan the diving horse hanging from a hoist; some Phish fans argued that the scene was a [...] "blatant" [...] reference to the cover of the band's seventh studio album, Hoist. [...] "That was a total coincidence", Jean said. [...] "It <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole Wizard of Oz/Pink Floyd (Dark Side of the Moon) hook-up. I haven't done it and I'm sure it works, but I just keep thinking that it must be a coincidence.

Awen suggests both poetic inspiration and the general creative vision by which people and societies form their aspirations. [...] It {{was important to me}} that the English words on the building should not simply be a translation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Welsh, that they should have their own message. <b>The</b> strata <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slate frontage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wales Millennium Centre <b>reminded</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizons just beyond Penarth Head.

500|$|... "Race Against Time" [...] was {{released}} on the 12-inch, cassette, and CD versions of the single. [...] The song developed from the band's interest in urban funk, and was described by The Edge as [...] "a kind of Afro-rhythmic piece" [...] and [...] "a study in rhythm." [...] The bass riff in the song, inspired by the bodhrán, was played by The Edge, but stemmed from some of Clayton's unused bass parts. Mullen's drum part was recorded in a single take. The song is primarily an instrumental piece but does contain some lyrics inspired by Bono's trip to Ethiopia after Live Aid and his witnessing firsthand the famine in occurrence; these lyrical references include Bono singing in an Ethiopian language and following it with the phrase [...] "Race against time". Bono said of the song, [...] "It <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> desert. The desert is so empty, but it aches with a strange kind of fullness."

500|$|An {{enthusiastic}} review {{came from}} The Wire, which felt that: [...] "In the end, Vespertine commits its magic by daring to go places more obvious and more human than {{one would have}} ever expected." [...] Calling it [...] "one {{of the most impressive}} and cohesive" [...] albums of the year, Tiny Mix Tapes found Vespertine to be Björk's most effective use of the studio as an instrument. Simon Reynolds, praised it in Uncut saying [...] "Her best yet, it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> jackfrost wonderland of Cocteau Twins circa In The Gold Dust Rush, of the bejewelled coldness of Siouxsie and the Banshees circa A Kiss in the Dreamhouse. The glittering sound fits the album's idea of inner riches, the treasure people keep hidden inside." [...] Katy Widder, writer for PopMatters, believed the album was a masterpiece, stating that it challenged the predominant theories of rock music and gender, particularly a statement made by Simon Reynolds and Joy Press in the acclaimed book, The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll: [...] "Women have seized rock 'n' roll and usurped it for their own expressive purposes, but we've yet to see a radical feminization of rock itself." [...] Chris Smith of Stylus Magazine praised the album for its nuance and delicacy, describing its sonic palette as [...] "a breath of fresh air." [...] Noting that Vespertine showed a more mature side of the singer, musicOMH's Michael Hubbard wrote that [...] "It sounds like Björk has grown up while that would be a pity, it is also fascinating for anyone who loves her music. She is a legend in her time." ...|$|E
