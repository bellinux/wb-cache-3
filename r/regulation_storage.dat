40|$|Background and Purpose: The {{importance}} of forest ecosystem services, related to provisioning {{of fresh water}} and water purification are of increasing importance, especially in urbanized areas. This study investigates key indicators for ecosystem services, related to drinking water protection, provided by urban and peri-urban forests. Material and Methods: Seven different monitoring programs, projects or directives, assessing water quality variables were analysed. We determined which indicators, describing the drinking water protection services in forest ecosystems, {{can be applied to}} urban forests. A list of core indicators sensitive to the specifics of the drinking water supply and urban forest ecosystems in Ljubljana were suggested. Results and Conclusion: Analysis included over 86 potential indicators related to nutrient <b>regulation,</b> <b>storage</b> capacity and water purification in forest canopies, forest soils, surface streams, lakes and groundwater. Through scientific review and the application of “necessary” and “feasible” criteria to urban forests the number of indicators was reduced to 62. According to the specifics of drinking water supply and urban forest in Ljubljana 52 core indicators have been selected. Due to the influence of urbanization on water bodies, special emphasis should be given to indicators for storage capacity and water purification capacity of urban forest ecosystems for hazardous substances. This might increase the willingness of decision and policy makers to acknowledge the water protection capacity of urban forests...|$|E
40|$|The caryopses {{of barley}} (Hordeum vulgare), as of all cereals, are complex sink organs {{optimized}} for starch accumulation and embryo development. While their early to late {{development has been}} studied in great detail, processes underlying the caryopses’ diurnal adaptation to changes in light, temperature, and the fluctuations in phloem-supplied carbon and nitrogen have remained unknown. In an attempt to identify diurnally affected processes in developing caryopses at the early maturation phase, we monitored global changes of both gene expression and metabolite levels. We applied the 22 K Barley 1 GeneChip microarray and identified 2, 091 differentially expressed (DE) genes that were assigned to six major diurnal expression clusters. Principal component analysis and other global analyses demonstrated that the variability within the data set relates to genes involved in circadian <b>regulation,</b> <b>storage</b> compound accumulation, embryo development, response to abiotic stress, and photosynthesis. The correlation of amino acid and sugar profiles with expression trajectories led to the identification of several hundred potentially metabolite-regulated DE genes. A comparative analysis of our data set and publicly available microarray data disclosed suborgan-specific expression of almost all diurnal DE genes, with more than 350 genes specifically expressed in the pericarp, endosperm, or embryo tissues. Our data reveal a tight linkage between day/night cycles, changes in light, and the supply of carbon and nitrogen. We present a model that suggests several phases of diurnal gene expression in developing barley caryopses, summarized as starvation and priming, energy collection and carbon fixation, light protection and chaperone activity, storage and growth, and embryo development...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Despite growing HIV {{and cancer}} {{prevalence}} in Sub-Saharan Africa, and WHO advocacy {{for a public}} health approach to palliative care provision, opioid availability is severely limited. Uganda has achieved a morphine roll-out programme {{in partnership with the}} Ministry of Health. This study aimed to evaluate that programme by identifying challenges to implementation that may inform replication. Methods A multi-methods protocol appraised morphine <b>regulation,</b> <b>storage,</b> prescribing, and consumption in three phases: key informant interviews throughout the opioid supply chain, and direct observation and audit of clinical practice. Results Regulation had achieved its goal of preventing misuse and leakage from the supply chain. However, the Government felt that relaxation of regulation was now appropriate. Confusion and complexity in storage and authorisation rules led to discontinuation of opioid pain management at the patient level and also wasted service time in trying to obtain supplies to which they were entitled. Continued neglect to prescribe among clinicians and public fear of opioids led to under prescribing, and clinical skills showed some evidence of need for improvement with respect to physical assessment and follow-up. Conclusion The Ugandan programme offers a successful model for both advocacy and Governmental support in achieving opioid roll-out across health districts. Despite initial concerns, abuse of opioids has not been evident. Further work is required to ensure that available supplies of opioids are prescribed to those in need, and that clinical standards are met. However, the programme for roll-out has proved a useful model to expand opioid availability as the first step in improving patient care, and may prove a useful template for other Sub-Saharan African countries. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A pot-grown {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the effect of limited irrigation on growth, storage water amount of every organ and water use of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings. Four watering treatments were designed in the study, i. e. (W 1 : 0. 3 θf, W 2 : 0. 5 θf, W 3 : 0. 7 θf, W 4 : 0. 9 θf, θf is the field capacity). Results show that Jatropha curcas L. seedlings has the higher resistance ability to drought-stress, it can survival in lower soil moisture (0. 3 θf), and has certain growth potential. Dry mass of every organ in plant shows that shoot＞branch and master rod＞leaf＞root＞petiole. Storage water capability of unit dry mass for every organ in plant shows that petiole＞branch and master rod or shoot＞leaf＞root. Compared to W 4 treatments, W 2 reduced irrigation water by 27. 1 %, mean leaf area of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings for W 2 reduced by 25. 8 %, but root-shoot ratio increased by 6. 1 %, meanwhile, mean storage water capability of unit root, lateral branch and master rod, leaf, shoot and total plant dry mass of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings for W 2 increased by 15. 4 %, 1. 3 %, 7. 4 %, 0. 6 % and 1. 8 %, respectively. But mean root, shoot and total plant dry mass accumulation of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings for W 2 only reduced by 11. 4 %, 17. 7 %, 15. 8 %, respectively, therefore, irrigation water use efficiency and total water use efficiency of Jatropha curcas L. seedlings for W 2 increased by 15. 5 %, 14. 9 %, respectively. It is clear that W 2 treatment not only increased water use efficiency, but increased <b>regulation</b> <b>storage</b> water capability, thus W 2 treatment’s Jatropha curcas L. seedlings improved water regulation and controlled water balance capability and resistance ability to drought-stress...|$|E
