The new core design aims at a power level of 260 &# 8201;MW with a long lifetime of 30 &# 8201;years without refueling and a reactivity swing smaller than 1000 &# 8201;pcm. Starting from five initial candidate cores with various breed-and-burn strategies, an optimum core was selected {{from a combination of}} the two candidates that shows a proper breeding behavior with the optimized uranium enrichment in the low-enriched uranium region and the optimized size of the blanket region. The depletion analysis of the new core provides various reactor design parameters such as the core multiplication factor, breeding ratio, heavy metal mass change, power distribution, and summary of neutron balance. In addition, the perturbation analysis provides the reactor kinetic parameters and reactivity feedback coefficients for the inherent safety analysis of the core. The integral reactivity parameters of the quasi-static <b>reactivity</b> <b>balance</b> analysis demonstrate that the new core is inherently safe in cases of unprotected loss of flow, unprotected loss of heat sink, and unprotected transient over power. clos...|$|E

40|$|Preliminary neutronic {{studies have}} been {{performed}} {{in order to provide}} guidelines to the design of a liquid-salt cooled Very High Temperature Reactor (LS-VHTR) using Li{sub 2 }BeF{sub 4 } (FLiBe) as coolant and a solid cylindrical core. The studies were done using the lattice codes (WIMS 8 and DRAGON) and the linear reactivity model to estimate the core <b>reactivity</b> <b>balance,</b> fuel composition, discharge burnup, and reactivity coefficients. An evaluation of the lattice codes revealed that they give very similar accuracy as the Monte Carlo MCNP 4 C code for the prediction of the fuel element multiplication factor (kinf) and the double heterogeneity effect of the coated fuel particles in the graphite matrix. The loss of coolant from the LS-VHTR core following coolant voiding was found to result in a positive reactivity addition, due primarily to the removal of the strong neutron absorber Li- 6. To mitigate this positive reactivity addition and its impact on reactor design (positive void reactivity coefficient), the lithium in the coolant must be enriched to greater than 99. 995 % in its Li- 7 content. For the reference LS-VHTR considered in this work, {{it was found that the}} magnitude of the coolant void reactivity coefficient (CVRC) is quite small (less than $ 1 for 100 % voiding). The coefficient was found to become more negative or less positive with increase in the lithium enrichment (Li- 7 content). It was also observed that the coefficient is positive at the beginning of cycle and becomes more negative with increasing burnup, indicating that by using more than one fuel batch, the coefficient could be made negative at the beginning of cycle. It might, however, still be necessary at the beginning of life to design for a negative CVRC value. The study shows that this can be done by using burnable poisons (erbium is a leading candidate) or by changing the reference assembly design (channel dimensions) in order to modify the neutron spectrum. Parametric {{studies have been}} performed to attain targeted cycle length of 18 months and discharge burnup greater than 100 GWd/t with a constraint on the uranium enrichment (less than 20 % to support non-proliferation goals). The results show that the required uranium enrichment and discharge burnup increase with the number of batches. The three-batch scheme is, however, impractical because the required uranium enrichment is greater than 20 %. The required enrichment is smallest for the one-batch case, but its discharge burnup is smaller than the target value. Therefore, the two-batch scheme is desirable to satisfy simultaneously the target cycle length and discharge burnup. It was additionally shown that to increase the core power density to 150 % of the reference core value, the required uranium enrichment is less than 20 % in the single-batch scheme. This higher power density might not be achievable in the two- or three-batch schemes because the fuel enrichment would exceed 20 %...|$|E
40|$|Although thorium {{has long}} been {{considered}} {{as an alternative to}} uranium-based fuels, most of the reactors built to-date have been fueled with uranium-based fuel {{with the exception of a}} few reactors. The decision to use uranium-based fuels was initially made based on the technology maturity compared to thorium-based fuels. As a result of this experience, lot of knowledge and data have been accumulated for uranium-based fuels that made it the predominant nuclear fuel type for extant nuclear power. However, following the recent concerns about the extent and availability of uranium resources, thorium-based fuels have regained significant interest worldwide. Thorium is more abundant than uranium and can be readily exploited in many countries and thus is now seen as a possible alternative. As thorium-based fuel technologies mature, fuel conversion from uranium to thorium is expected to become a major interest in both thermal and fast reactors. In this study the feasibility of fuel conversion in a fast reactor is assessed and several possible approaches are proposed. The analyses are performed using the Advanced Fast Reactor (AFR- 100) design, a fast reactor core concept recently developed by ANL. The AFR- 100 is a small 100 MW{sub e} reactor developed under the US-DOE program relying on innovative fast reactor technologies and advanced structural and cladding materials. It was designed to be inherently safe and offers sufficient margins with respect to the fuel melting temperature and the fuel-cladding eutectic temperature when using U- 10 Zr binary metal fuel. Thorium-based metal fuel was preferred to other thorium fuel forms because of its higher heavy metal density and it does not need to be alloyed with zirconium to reduce its radiation swelling. The various approaches explored cover the use of pure thorium fuel as well as the use of thorium mixed with transuranics (TRU). Sensitivity studies were performed for the different scenarios envisioned in order to determine the best core performance characteristics for each of them. With the exception of the fuel type and enrichment, the reference AFR- 100 core design characteristics were kept unchanged, including the general core layout and dimensions, assembly dimensions, materials and power rating. In addition, the mass of {sup 235 }U required was kept within a reasonable range from that of the reference AFR- 100 design. The core performance characteristics, kinetics parameters and reactivity feedback coefficients were calculated using the ANL suite of fast reactor analysis code systems. Orifice design calculations and the steady-state thermal-hydraulic analyses were performed using the SE 2 -ANL code. The thermal margins were evaluated by comparing the peak temperatures to the design limits for parameters such as the fuel melting temperature and the fuel-cladding eutectic temperature. The inherent safety features of AFR- 100 cores proposed were assessed using the integral reactivity parameters of the quasi-static <b>reactivity</b> <b>balance</b> analysis. The design objectives and requirements, the computation methods used as well as a description of the core concept are provided in Section 2. The three major approaches considered are introduced in Section 3 and the neutronics performances of those approaches are discussed in the same section. The orifice zoning strategies used and the steady-state thermal-hydraulic performance are provided in Section 4.

40|$|Department of Nuclear EngineeringThe {{sodium-cooled}} {{fast reactor}} (SFR) {{is one of}} the six Gen-IV reactor concepts, and it is a near-term deployable reactor concept with its technological achievement and the experience through that many countries have operated and developed. On the other hand, the small modular reactor (SMR) concept is representative reactor design concept for the near future regarding the advanced plant design trend. There are some SMR concepts developed in some countries and it is expected that the SMR market would be enlarged to fit the global electricity demand with the flexibility of SMRs. In this thesis, a hybrid concept of SFR and SMR is developed with the characteristics of an ultra-long cycle operation and the advanced safety feature arisen from the combination design of the two reactor design concepts. There are some important parameters in the fast reactor physics such as conversion ratio, capture to fission ratio, fertile fission bonus, and they can be very different according to the design option. The coolant void reactivity and the thermal expansion coefficients are the critical parameters in fast reactor core design that decide the safety of the core. Choosing metal fuel and liquid metal coolant also secure the inherent safety of fast reactor with its reactivity parameters so the materials of them dominate the key characteristics of the core. At the same time, to have transportability of the reactor modules, which {{is one of the}} important identities of SMR, the diameter of the reactor vessel or the core barrel is limited less than 3 m. Before reactor design, the feasibility study of the ultra-long cycle operation was performed for the target of 30 -year operation. For this, existing small fast reactor concepts with long-cycle operation were assessed first, and the fuel, coolant, and structure materials were reviewed. In the reactor design stage, the reactor and core design requirements were set based on the previous SFR and SMR design studies and the feasibility study of long cycle operation of small fast reactors. With the core design requirement, pin, assembly and the core design parameters were determined so as to have the safety feature in any state during the long cycle operation. With the fixed core geometry, five breed-and-burn strategies were tested in the five different cores, and finally an optimized breed-and-burn strategy was developed through the combination of the test cases. The core performance of the final core design was evaluated and the operation feasibility was assessed in the neutronics point of view. It was confirmed that the 30 -year operation of the core is feasible even its conversion ratio is less than unity and that the active core breeds in radial direction from the peripheral region and the power peak moves to the core center as the burnup propagates. The Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) spent fuel was tested by loading for the blanket material and the operation feasibility of it was also confirmed. Core kinetics parameters and reactivity feedback coefficients were assessed, and the sodium void worth and expansion coefficients show negative values. The control rod system was investigated that it is optimized to control the core reactivity to make it critical throughout its operation time and to secure the shutdown margin and another primary control rod material was proposed. With the integral reactivity parameters, the quasi-static <b>reactivity</b> <b>balance</b> analysis performed for the anticipated transient without scram (ATWS) events, the unprotected loss of flow (ULOF), unprotected loss of heat sink (ULOHS), and unprotected transient over power (UTOP) events, and it shows the inherent safety of the core. Furthermore, the transient analysis was also performed and it has been confirmed that this newly developed core is inherently safe and has capability to cope with the beyond design basis accident (BDBA). Both Monte Carlo and deterministic approaches were utilized by using neutronics computer codes for the steady-state analysis in the design and evaluation stage of the core modeling. Moreover, safety analysis computer code system was also utilized to perform the transient analysis for the modeled core. ope...|$|E

Previous efforts have produced prelithiated Si nanoparticles with dry air stability, which cannot be stabilized under ambient air. Here, we developed a one-pot metallurgical process to synthesize Lix Si/Li 2 O composites by using low-cost SiO or SiO 2 as the starting material. The resulting composites consist of homogeneously dispersed Lix Si nanodomains embedded in a highly crystalline Li 2 O matrix, providing the composite excellent stability even in ambient air with 40 % relative humidity.

However, the CO poison at the anode and the slow kinetics of the ORR at the cathode for Pt based-catalysts limit its widespread application, which motivated extensive research for more effective catalysts with CO tolerant, highly active and lower Pt loading, and/or highly selective for CO PROX. Density functional theory calculations have been used to screen Pt-based catalysts for PEMFC. It is found that the direct contact with Pt catalysts (so-called Pt-skin) is essential. The reactivity of Pt-skin catalysts towards the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and the hydrogen evolution reaction(HER) can be modulated by stepwise increase of Ni contents, which are accomplished by the modification of the reactivity through ligand and geometrical effects.

40|$|To {{precisely}} map {{the changes}} in hydrologic response of catchments (e. g. water <b>balance,</b> <b>reactivity</b> or extremes), we need sensitive and interpretable indicators. In this study we defined nine hydrologically meaningful signature indices: five indices were sampled on the flow duration curve, four indices were {{closely linked to the}} distribution of event runoff coefficients. We applied these signature indices to the output from a hydrologic catchment model for three different catchments located in the Nahe basin (Western Germany) to detect differences in runoff behavior resulting from different meteorological input data. The models were driven by measured and simulated (COSMO-CLM) meteorological data. It could be shown that the application of signature indices is a very sensitive tool to assess differences in simulated runoff behavior resulting from climatic data sets of different sources. Specifically, the selected signature indices allow assessing changes in water balance, vertical water distribution, reactivity, seasonality and runoff generation. These indices showed that the hydrological model is very sensitive to biases in mean and spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation and temperature because it acts as a filter for the meteorological input. Besides model calibration and model structural deficits, we found that bias correction of temperature fields and further adjustment of bias correction of precipitation fields is absolutely essential. We conclude that signature indices can act as indirect "efficiency measures" or "similarity measures" for output from regional or local climate models...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{efforts have been}} spent in the {{development}} of innovative reactors capable of operating with flexible Conversion Ratio (CR). Fast Reactors (FR) are natural candidates since they allow to achieve high CR, as well as an efficient TRU burning through a low CR and the closure of the fuel cycle. Among the fast-spectrum systems, a peculiar role is played by the Molten Salt Fast Reactor. This reactor lacks the sound technological basis available for the solid-fuelled liquid-metal-cooled FRs, but it shows fuel cycle potential benefits: it uses Th, which features vast natural resources and mitigates waste management issues due to a low generation of TRUs; it can naturally operate with flexible CR without design modifications thanks to the online reprocessing system; it can achieve high CR, with doubling times of the order of 40 years or lower; it can achieve good TRU-burning rates and very high burning rates of minor actinides. However, such fuel cycle flexibility implies a wide variety of fuel salt compositions. Along with the variation of the fuel salt properties, concerns arise for the varying safety features of the core, especially when using the MSFR as TRU- burner. This work first summarizes results regarding the fuel cycle performances of the MSFR when used as breeder, iso-breeder or burner reactor. Subsequently, safety parameters are computed for each fuel cycle option and a simple approach based on <b>reactivity</b> and energy <b>balances</b> is employed to predict the reactor steady-state after major accidental transient initiators, thus giving indications of its inherent safety features for different fuel cycle strategies...|$|R

In a preliminary and scoping stage the designer needs to evaluate options iteratively by using fast computer simulations. The Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) {{has been involved in}} the development of models and calculational procedures for the analysis (neutronic and thermal hydraulic) of power sources for nuclear electric propulsion. The nuclear modules will be integrated into the whole simulation of the nuclear electric propulsion system. The vehicles use either a Brayton direct-conversion cycle, using the heated helium from a NERVA-type reactor, or a potassium Rankine cycle, with the working fluid heated on the secondary side of a heat exchanger and lithium on the primary side coming from a fast reactor. Given a set of input conditions, the codes calculate composition. dimensions, volumes, and masses of the core, reflector, control system, pressure vessel, neutron and gamma shields, as well as the thermal hydraulic conditions of the coolant, clad and fuel. Input conditions are power, core life, pressure and temperature of the coolant at the inlet of the core, either the temperature of the coolant at the outlet of the core or the coolant mass flow and the fluences and integrated doses at the cargo area. Using state-of-the-art neutron cross sections and transport codes, a database was created for the neutronic performance of both reactor designs.

Individual agents can have different motivations for engaging in interactions. Also, agents can possibly recognise the goals of the other participants in the interaction. To successfully interact, an agent should exhibit the ability to <b>balance</b> <b>reactivity,</b> pro-activeness (autonomy) and sociability. That is, individual agents should deliberate not only on what they themselves know about the working environment and their desires, but also on what they know about the beliefs and desires of the other agents in their group. Multi-agent systems have proven to be a useful tool for modelling and solving problems that exhibit complex and distributed structures. Examples include real-time traffic control and monitoring, work-flow management and information retrieval in computer networks. There are two broad challenges that the agent community is currently investigating. One is the development of the formalisms for representing the knowledge the agents have about their actions, goals, plans for achieving their goals and other agents. The second challenge is the development of the reasoning mechanisms agents use to achieve autonomy during the course of their interactions. Our research interests lie in a model for the interactions among the agents, whereby the behaviour of the individual agents can be specified in a declarative manner and these specifications can be made executable. Therefore, we investigate the methods that effectively represent the agents 2 ̆ 7 knowledge about their working environment (which includes other agents), to derive unrealised information from the agents 2 ̆ 7 knowledge by considering that the agents can obtain only a partial image of their working environment. The research also deals with the logical reasoning about the knowledge of the other agents to achieve a better interaction. Our approach is to apply the notions of modality and non-monotonic reasoning to formalise and to confront the problem of incomplete and conflicting information when modelling multi-agent systems. The approach maintains the richness in the description of the logical method while providing an efficient and easy-to-implement reasoning mechanism.
