Currently owned by Fury Sportscars who {{recently}} purchased the rights from BGH Geartech., based in Kent UK.The Fury has been very successful in competition with cars currently racing in many championships, including the 750 Motor Club's RGB (Road-Going Bike-Engined Kitcar) and Kitcar series. Many different engines can be fitted to the Fury, including all manner of car engines from the Ford Crossflow to Rover V8 and Cosworth Turbo. Motorbike engines have also been fitted and are popular for track cars due to the low weight, high power and built-in sequential gearbox for relatively little morey.There are {{two versions of the}} Fury rear suspension, the Live Axle version uses the Ford Escort rear axle located using two trailing links in conjunction with a Panhard <b>rod.</b> <b>Coil</b> over shock absorbers are used to give good ride comfort combined with excellent handling and grip. The Independent Rear Suspension version uses the Ford Sierra rear hub assembly in conjunction with purpose built hub carriers forming the uprights between upper and lower wishbones.

Solution based electrolytes are flammable and typically incompatible with lithium metal anodes, limiting energy density. We have previously demonstrated use of polyimide <b>rod</b> <b>coil</b> block copolymers doped with lithium salts as electrolytes for lithium polymer batteries. The polyimide rod blocks provide dimensional stability while the polyethylene oxide (PEO) coil portions conduct ions. Phase separation of the rods and coils in these highly branched polymers provide channels with an order of magnitude improvement in lithium conduction over polyethylene oxide itself at room temperature. In addition, the polymers have been demonstrated in coin cells to be compatible with lithium metal. For practical use at room temperature and below, however, at least an order of magnitude improvement in ion conduction is still required. The addition of nonvolatile, room temperature ionic liquids has been shown to improve the ionic conductivity of high molecular weight PEO.

40|$|International audienceBlock {{copolymers}} {{have been}} widely investigated over the past decades {{for their ability to}} microphase separate into well-defined nanostructured thin films with tailored physical properties. The aim of the present study is to investigate the thin film properties of <b>rod</b> <b>coil</b> block copolymer/phenyl-C- 61 -butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) blends {{as a function of the}} blend weight ratio, using a copolymer which is based on a poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) rod block and poly(4 -vinylpyridine) (P 4 VP) coil block. Atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction analysis are used to study the influence of PCBM on the copolymer self-assembling. UV-visible absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopies as well as field-effect mobility measurements are performed in order to get further insight into the blend optoelectronic properties. It is found that the block copolymer phase-separated morphology and charge carrier mobilities strongly depend on the PCBM loading and thermal annealing. In particular, the results point out that PCBM enhances the block copolymer microphase separation within a narrow range of the polymer:PCBM weight ratio. In addition, clear evidence for PCBM accumulation within the P 4 VP domains is found by monitoring the P 3 HT fluorescence and charge carrier mobilities...|$|E
40|$|Interfaces play an {{important}} role in bulk heterojunction organic/inorganic hybrid photovoltaic devices, but directly probing the interface to improve device characteristics is exceedingly difficult. The purpose of this work is to develop a method to create a discrete polymer-nanowire system that is free from bulk effects using fabrication methods that will most easily translate to traditional thin film photovoltaic device fabrication. Using these individual nanohybrids, we seek to explore the nature of the polymer-nanowire interface and develop methods to manipulate the morphology of this interface. To this end, we report on a method to form core-shell inorganic nanowire-polymer hybrids of a conducting polymer, poly (3 -hexlthiophene 2, 5 diyl) (P 3 HT) and a semiconducting nanowire, cadmium sulfide (CdS) using solution processing to create the polymer shell around the nanowire in order to study the polymer-nanowire interface directly without interference from bulk effects. The solution processing technique yielded solution color changes from an orange colored solution to a purple colored solution. This color change is an intrinsic property of conjugated polymers such as P 3 HT that represents a change in polymer chain conformation from a 2 ̆ 7 coil 2 ̆ 7 dominated conformation where the thiophene are predominately non-aligned to a 2 ̆ 7 rod 2 ̆ 7 dominated conformation of predominately aligned thiophene monomers called 2 ̆ 7 chromism 2 ̆ 7 or the rod-coil transition. Nanohybrids produced in an environment where the polymer conformation is predominately in a coil conformation produced polymer-nanowire interfaces that lacked crystallinity. In order to promote a more crystalline interface, we have used the <b>rod</b> <b>coil</b> transition with temperature (thermochromism) in P 3 HT to create a polymer chain conformation in solution in order to effect a change in the morphology of the polymer-nanowire interface. As the temperature of the solution drops further below the rod-coil transition temperature (10 °C), the P 3 HT conformation changes to a predominately rod conformation. This rod dominated chain conformation has been shown through TEM characterization to enhance the crystallinity at the polymer nanowire interface. Also, the <b>rod</b> <b>coil</b> transition with respect to solvent quality (solvatochromism) has been shown to have a very strong effect on the crystallinity at the polymer-nanowire interface. Solvents with a large solubility parameter with respect to P 3 HT, such as methanol and isopropanol, create very large crystalline domains at the polymer nanowire interface compared to solvents that have solubility parameters closer to P 3 HT, such as pyridine and hexanol. We have shown that creating more order within the P 3 HT main chain prior to deposition on the nanowire, by controlling the temperature and the solvent quality, can increase the extent of polymer crystallinity present at the polymer-nanowire interface. These results lead the way to more advanced manipulations of the polymer-nanowire interface in order to increase efficiency in bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices. ...|$|E
40|$|Our {{research}} {{focuses on}} the role of intermediate proteins in human disease. Desmin, a major intermediate filament protein in muscle cells, is organized into a central coiledcoil alpha helical domain flanked by globular head and tail domains. Our goal is to decipher the functional significance of the association of desmin to the giant thin filament protein nebulin at the sarcomeric Z-discs and its relation to muscle disease. Mutations in nebulin cause nemaline myopathy, a debilitating genetic muscle disease that affects children and adults alike. Previous research has shown that nebulin has a high affinity binding to desmin. However, {{little is known about the}} contribution of lower affinity binding desmin domains to nebulin or about the involvement of this interaction in nemaline myopathy. We hypothesize that the desmin 3 -dimensional linkage to nebulin contributes to nemaline myopathy pathology. To test our hypothesis, we tested the binding profile of a nebulin-associated nemaline myopathy mutation to particular desmin domains using biochemical approaches. Our ELISA and GST-pull down assays showed that nebulin modules 160 - 164 bind to desmin?s central <b>rod</b> <b>coil</b> 2 b and tail subdomains. Moreover, we found significantly decreased binding of the desmin coil 2 b to the nemaline myopathy Nebulin M 160 - 164 T 5681 P mutant as compared to nebulin M 160 - 164. A 3 -fold binding increase of the coil 2 b was found in random alanine nebulin M 160 - 164 L 5646 A mutant as compared to nebulin nemaline-associated nebulin M 160 - 164 T 5681 P mutant, underscoring the importance of this region to the interaction of desmin and nebulin. Taken together, our findings suggest that differences in the binding profile of nemaline-associated nebulin mutations to desmin may contribute to our understanding the underlying molecular mechanism responsible for this disease. This knowledge may be significant because it may aid in devising new treatments for nemaline myopathy patients in the future...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the interaction potential between two chiral rod-like colloids which {{consist of a}} thin cylindrical backbone decorated with a helical charge distribution on the cylinder surface. For sufficiently slender <b>coiled</b> <b>rods</b> a simple scaling expression is derived which links the chiral `twisting' potential to the intrinsic properties of the particles such as the coil pitch, charge density and electrostatic screening parameter. To predict {{the behavior of the}} macroscopic cholesteric pitch we invoke a simple second-virial theory generalized for weakly twisted director fields. While the handedness of the cholesteric phase for weakly <b>coiled</b> <b>rods</b> is always commensurate with that of the internal coil, more strongly <b>coiled</b> <b>rods</b> display cholesteric order with opposite handedness. The correlation between the symmetry of the microscopic helix and the macroscopic cholesteric director field is quantified in detail.

Our findings are consistent with experimental results and could be helpful in interpreting experimental observations in systems of cellulose and chitin microfibers, DNA and fd virus rods.

40|$|Polymer {{science is}} {{exploring}} advanced materials which combine functional domains such as proteins and semiconducting polymers with traditional flexible polymers {{in the same}} molecule. While thermodynamic assemblies of different geometries introduce many interesting new phenomena such as entropic packing and liquid crystalline interactions, dynamic effects are also important to understand for optimal design of material mechanics, processing kinetics, and the new physics that directly arises from the motion of multiple domains of dissimilar geometries. Rod-coil block copolymers are an example of hybrid molecules that have attracted recent interest for organic electronics and biomaterials. This thesis uses theory, simulation, and experiments {{to better understand the}} mechanisms of molecular motion in entangled rod-coil block copolymers as a model for this wider class of functional polymeric materials. The large geometrical differences between rigid <b>rods</b> and Gaussian <b>coils</b> cause significant nonlinearities in dynamical behavior as these two motifs are combined on the same molecule. It is shown that the motion of rod-coils is slowed relative to <b>rod</b> and <b>coil</b> homopolymers because of a mismatch between the curvature of the <b>rod</b> and <b>coil</b> entanglement tubes. This mismatch causes different relaxation mechanisms in the small and large rod limits, where either the <b>rod</b> or the <b>coil</b> block is expected to determine the motion of the overall molecule. In the small rod limit where the rod is a perturbation on coil motion, the randomly varying curvature of the coil's tube presents entropic barriers to the reptation of the rod, modifying the unhindered motion of the coil along its tube into an activated reptation process. In the large rod limit where the coil is a perturbation on rod motion, the long rod cannot rotate around the surrounding entanglements so motion is only possible when the coil moves into a straightened entanglement tube in an arm retraction process. These mechanisms were first explored in molecular dynamics simulation using the Kremer- Grest model of entangled polymers, which showed that the tracer diffusion of coil-rod-coil triblock copolymers was slower than both <b>rod</b> and <b>coil</b> homopolymers. This observation was verified experimentally by forced Rayleigh scattering in both the small and large rod limits. Using additional simulations and experiments, the theories were applied to more complex configurations such as diblock copolymers and self-diffusion in polymer melts, where additional effects including molecular asymmetry and the motion of the surrounding chains were incorporated. Finally, a more detailed and quantitative analysis of the mechanisms both individually and in combination was performed using a coarse-grained slip-link model which matched the previous simulations and experiments. by Muzhou Wang.
