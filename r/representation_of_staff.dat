40|$|As {{the title}} of the thesis indicates, I {{addressed}} the number <b>of</b> the <b>staff</b> and their qualification representation at the individual departments of the hospital in Písek. I cooperated with head nurses as well as other nursing staff in the hospital and acquired information from them. The first hypothesis was that the number <b>of</b> the nursing <b>staff</b> work load at standard surgical departments corresponds with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method. This hypothesis was not confirmed as the average number <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> at surgical departments was higher than the methodology states. The second hypothesis was that the number <b>of</b> the nursing <b>staff</b> work load at standard internal departments corresponds with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method. The number <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> at internal departments was also higher than the recommendations of the method; neurology was the only department where the number <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> was lower than recommended. The second hypothesis also was not confirmed. The third hypothesis was that the number <b>of</b> the nursing <b>staff</b> work load at nursing beds corresponds with the recommendations of Karla Pochylás method. The number <b>of</b> the <b>staff</b> at nursing beds was higher than recommended by the method. This hypothesis was not confirmed.

The topic is up-to-date mainly {{for the lack of}} funds in health care and for the permanent pressure from the general public on the need of health care quality improvement. The works of Karla and Otakar Pochylý, who published their first book dealing with these issues in 1999, were the basic inputs for the research part of the thesis. We set the following hypotheses before commencement of the research: 1 ? The numbers <b>of</b> nursing <b>staff</b> at standard health care units are in line with K. Pochylá?s methodology. This hypothesis was partly confirmed. The average numbers <b>of</b> nursing <b>staff</b> workloads are in line with K. Pochylá?s methodology at two surgical departments only. 2 ? Qualification <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> nursing <b>staff</b> at the individual health care units complies with the recommended methodology of K. Pochylá. This hypothesis was not confirmed. <b>Representation</b> <b>of</b> the nursing <b>staff</b> qualifications is based on the individual needs of the particular departments. 3 ? The number <b>of</b> nursing <b>staff</b> members at the intensive care unit corresponds with the recommended methodology of K. Pochylá. This hypothesis was not confirmed. The number of nurses is lower by 2. 23 in average at the intensive care unit.

It might also serve as a guide helping top managers with efficient utilization of human resources in health care facilities.

40|$|The Higher Education sector {{as a whole}} {{has come}} under {{increasing}} levels of public scrutiny over recent years, often critiqued in relation to sustainable funding strategies and levels of public funding. One response from Governments and HEIs is to consider institutional merger as a means of reducing the number of providers, whilst maintaining levels of access to and quality of higher education. This thesis seeks to review a merger case study – University of the West of Scotland (UWS) - created in 2007 following a merger of the ‘University of Paisley’ and ‘Bell College of Higher Education’ creating Scotland’s largest modern (post- 1992) university with over 20, 000 students and around 2, 500 staff. Whilst many organisational mergers are referenced as failures (eg, Epstein 2005) or presented as cases whereby success cannot be reliably measured for around 10 years post-merger (eg, Mao et al 2009), in 2010 the UWS merger was lauded a success by the Scottish Government and Scottish Funding Council. This study seeks to ascertain what were the key factors in the merger process that resulted in this successful outcome. A literature review is provided, followed by a research methodology that includes document analysis, in-depth focussed interviews and focus groups. Document analysis is considered fundamental to gaining a thorough understanding of the vision, intended outcome of the merger and the strategic approach the institution took to deliver a successful merger. In-depth focussed interviews with senior staff of the University explore key themes identified from the literature review and resultant conceptual framework, this will be supplemented by focus groups with a number of academic and support staff to ensure <b>representation</b> <b>of</b> <b>staff</b> views cutting across the layers of the organisation. The qualitative data extracted via these methods inform the findings and conclusions of the study. This study is expected to be of particular interest to scholars, practitioners and policy makers in the higher education arena. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

40|$|Doctors {{take many}} forms of leave to further career training. Many {{hospital}} rotas omit these and are not updated frequently to reflect swaps in on-call duties. As a result, confusion arises with reduced staffing levels leading to sub-optimal patient care. Using Google Sheets, rota’s can be modified to be team specific, remotely accessed, and edited by any device with an internet connection and web browser. A qualitative pre and post-implementation questionnaire assessed {{the usefulness of the}} online rota. The rota was trialled on a surgical and medical team containing foundation year, core medical, core surgical, and registrar trainees. The respective surgical and medical rotas were copied, modified and pasted into a Google Sheet to contain only team specific information including all forms of leave. A link was emailed allowing teams to access and edit the rota. Post-implementation questionnaire 90 % (n= 10) stated they could access it remotely and 100 % felt the new rota was very easy to use. Finally, 80 % stated the Google Doc rota was a definite improvement on the old trust rota. The rota was then trialled on an ITU SHO rota (n= 8). The results were reproducible with 88 % feeling it addressed their requirements and stating it was an improvement on their old rota. As a result of the implementation appropriate staffing levels were maintained on the ward. The key advantages of the Google rota are that it included all forms of leave and helped ensure adequate staffing levels on the ward.

40|$|This article explores how managers, in the Call Centre of a Bank, (re) defined, {{and drew}} {{boundaries}} around 'past' cultural conditions, {{in relation to}} the introduction of a Business Process Reengineering (BPR) regime. Managers represented the 'past' negatively, in terms of conflict and coercion, whilst the 'present' was largely described as a Shangri-La of teams and consensus. This eschewing of the 'past' and sublimation of the 'present' stood in opposition to the <b>representations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>staff.</b> Both the 'staff' and 'managers' seemed to reject or embrace discourses that challenged or coincided with their understanding of how things are or should be. In view of this, their understanding of the past/present is inseparable from a consideration of power and identity. The article examines the interplay between discourses and individuals, arguing that it is bound up with fear and anxiety, hope and aspiration, memory and nostalgia, among other, everyday life experiences.
