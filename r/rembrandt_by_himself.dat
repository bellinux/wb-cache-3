5000|$|Slaughtered Ox, {{also known}} as Flayed Ox, Side of Beef, or Carcass of Beef, is a 1655 oil on beech panel {{painting}} <b>by</b> <b>Rembrandt.</b> It {{has been in the}} collection of the Louvre in Paris since 1857. A similar painting is in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, possibly <b>by</b> <b>Rembrandt</b> <b>himself</b> but probably <b>by</b> one of his pupils, perhaps Fabritius. [...] Other similar, paintings attributed to Rembrandt or his circle, are held by museums in Budapest and Philadelphia.|$|R
5000|$|The work follows in a {{tradition}} of showing butchery, for example Pieter Aertsen's A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms and Annibale Carracci's Butcher's Shop. Rembrandt made a drawing of a similar scene c.1635. Another, pre-1655, painting of a slaughtered ox (the example in Edinburgh, now attributed to Rembrandt's circle but formerly to Rembrandt) was perhaps inspired by a lost earlier work <b>by</b> <b>Rembrandt</b> <b>himself.</b> In northern Europe, the month of November was traditionally the season slaughtering livestock in northern Europe, before winter made feed difficult to find.|$|R
40|$|There exist several {{very similar}} looking {{versions}} of the painting ‘The Reading Hermit’, all allegedly painted <b>by</b> <b>Rembrandt</b> Harmenszoon van Rijn (approx. in ∼ 1630 A. D., Leiden). The classification of Rembrandt's paintings, which were produced <b>by</b> <b>Rembrandt</b> <b>himself,</b> in his academy by his students and the ones being mere copies is a crucial and difficult task. We gathered background evidence and performed elemental analyses by non-destructive micro-X-ray fluorescence (micro-XRF) in order to elucidate the painting's provenance. Elemental distributions of Ca, Mn, Fe and Cu show that the painting was presumably changed during the painting process, which indicates, together with neutron autoradiography (NAR) investigations, that this version of ‘The Reading Hermit’ is not a copy...|$|R
5000|$|Ernst van de Wetering {{divides the}} 31 {{etchings}} into categories; there [...] "are perhaps only four that were considered <b>by</b> <b>Rembrandt</b> <b>himself</b> as 'official' self-portraits of himself intended for wider dissemination". These are B7, B19, B21 and B22, stretching between 1631 and 1648. There {{are a number}} (7 or 8) of what seem to be abandoned attempts at such portraits around the same times, some then used as etching [...] "study sheets". Then there are 10 [...] "early studies in etching technique", most very rare, five [...] "studies in expression", which he distinguishes from the three tronies, finished images using Rembrandt's own features in historical costume.|$|R
5000|$|The Collection {{focuses on}} Rembrandt and his School, {{illuminating}} the personalities and themes that shaped the Golden Age over five generations. How the Collection developed is explained in Kaplan's personal {{account of the}} journey: [...] "A Portrait in Oil". At {{the core of the}} Collection is a group of eleven paintings and two drawings <b>by</b> <b>Rembrandt</b> <b>himself,</b> the largest private collection of the Master, and key members of his circle including his teacher, Pieter Lastman, and studio-mate Jan Lievens. In addition, the Collection encompasses the most extensive survey of his pupils outside of a museum, ranging from Gerrit Dou through to artists including Govert Flinck, Ferdinand Bol, and his last student, Aert de Gelder. The Collection also owns the last of the thirteen paintings that remains in private hands created by his most renowned pupil, Carel Fabritius.|$|R
5000|$|In 1898, the {{portrait}} {{was acquired by}} a New York art dealer from a private collector in St. Petersburg, Russia. [...] In 1899, {{the portrait}} was sold to Boston businessman Frederick Sears. [...] The painting was purchased by the Joslyn Museum in 1942 from a private collection. [...] Initially {{believed to have been}} painted <b>by</b> <b>Rembrandt</b> <b>himself,</b> the painting was later reclassified as a painting from the [...] "School of Rembrandt"; the likely work of one of Rembrandt's students. [...] In the spring of 2012, under the guidance of Ernst van de Wetering, one of the world's foremost authorities on Rembrandt, the museum sent the painting to Amsterdam for further study and treatment. [...] Martin Bijl, former head of restoration at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, worked with van de Wethering on the painting's conservation. The determination that the painting was a true Rembrandt was made during the conservation process.|$|R

30|$|Such {{combined}} {{art historical}} and technical research was first applied to Saul and David by De Vries et al. in 1978 [3]. In addition to visual analysis {{this study used}} X-radiography, infrared photography (~[*] 700 to 900  nm), magnified examination of the paint surface, and microscopic and wet-chemical analysis of pigment samples to characterize regions of the painting exhibiting stylistic differences. De Vries et al. examined the sequence of paint layers with a stereomicroscope {{and concluded that the}} painting was carried out in two distinct campaigns, or stages [3]. Like Gerson, they also distinguished between the figure of David and what they described as “rather wild strokes of paint across Saul’s thigh.” Their innovative approach, combining visual and technical evaluation of the stylistic inconsistencies in the picture, convinced them that the painting was executed in two stages, painted some years apart <b>by</b> <b>Rembrandt</b> <b>himself.</b> They proposed that Rembrandt completed most of the work—including the turban and the figure of David—around 1655, and that he later revised some areas—particularly Saul’s cloak—between 1660 and 1665 using rough brushwork typically seen in paintings from his late period.|$|R
