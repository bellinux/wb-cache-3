And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since way back in the sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you another thing you all need to think about, that even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E

And I don't really believe those polls. I travel around the country, I see people, I see their response to my husband, I see their response to me. There {{are a lot of}} difficult challenges <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page." ...|$|E

By the next month she started posting a number of images on social media website Instagram, where she hinted at possible songwriters and collaborators with hashtag captions. Two months later, Madonna posted a selfie where she talked about working with American DJ Diplo. Madonna had invited him to her annual Oscar party, but he was unable to attend.

In an interview with Idolator, Diplo explained that Madonna had asked him to provide his [...] "craziest record" [...] for the album. Together they wrote and recorded seven songs and Diplo added that [...] " [...] was up for anything. I love when an artist gives a producer the confidence he needs to work with them, and [...] was very open-minded to my ideas. Those records are gonna be crazy-sounding.

500|$|By December 2013, Madonna's manager Guy Oseary {{commented that}} the singer was [...] "eager to get started" [...] on her next album. However, she had another project in mind – {{developing}} the screenplay for the Andrew Sean Greer novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Madonna decided to split her time between writing the screenplay and writing songs for the new album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying: [...] "I'm <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I {{want to go with}} my music". Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed {{that a lot of the}} people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. [...] "So, I was just the person standing there with a clipboard in the headlights, going 'Ok!' A little bit like a school teacher," [...] she admitted.|$|E
500|$|Brian Lowry of Variety {{positively}} {{wrote that}} the finale [...] "ignored" [...] the last few seasons' missteps and was [...] "awash in warmth and inside gags". He concluded that the show [...] "deserved to finish on top", and that {{while some of the}} scenes, such as Dwight's wedding seemed [...] "a little bit trite", the resulting product was successful. Michael Tedder of Vulture awarded the episode five stars out of five and {{wrote that the}} episode was able to provide solid conclusions for all of the characters. Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] and wrote that [...] "the quality of this series finale is found in the way it functions <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afterglow of a TV show to which many devoted more than 100 hours of their lives. Some aspects of the episode fall flat, but when it hits, it hits." [...] Ultimately, he found that Finale' is not a great piece of television" [...] but that it was the finale that [...] "The Office needed" [...] because it was [...] "the right point to jump off ... the circular track", due to the series idea of thematic reoccurrence. Tom Gliatto of People magazine, however, gave the episode a negative review, and wrote that [...] "this episode was poorly conceived and clumsily structured. It really wasn't worthy of all the years of affectionate humor that had gone before it." ...|$|E

[...] In a 2002 interview with Taylor, Susan Settlemyre Williams proposed Emily Dickinson, Marianne Moore, and Elizabeth Bishop as possible influences, but Taylor herself acknowledged Edna St. Vincent Millay as the poet she had read enthusiastically as a student, and who had [...] "made me feel that poetry was contemporary and could relate to me <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way that you know that all those wonderful heroines of poetry and heroes do, ...".|$|E

[...] At the time, one columnist noted: [...] "The Wolves have an excellent man on the campus <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> person of Franklin 'Baldy' Cappon, assistant athletic director.

[...] During this time, Homme sank into a deep depression, noting [...] "I would never say, 'I'm probably not gonna make it out of here.' But back then, I would definitely think it." [...] The remaining members of Queens of the Stone Age— guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, drummer Joey Castillo, bassist Michael Shuman and guitarist and keyboardist Dean Fertita – encouraged Homme to return to the band to begin work on a sixth studio album. Homme noted, [...] "I had to ask them 'If {{you want to make a}} record with me <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> state I’m in, come into the fog. It's the only chance you got.'

He was a swine of a man and a jabbering dupe of a president. [...] was an evil man—evil in a way that only those who believe in the physical reality of the Devil can understand it." [...] Following Nixon's pardon by Gerald Ford in 1974, Hunter ruminated on the approximately $400,000 pension Nixon maneuvered his way into, by resigning before being formally indicted. While The Washington Post was lamenting Nixon's [...] "lonely and depressed" [...] state after being forced from the White House, Hunter wrote that 'f there were any such thing as true justice in this world, his [...] rancid carcass would be somewhere down around Easter Island <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> belly of a hammerhead shark.'
