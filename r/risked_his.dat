25|$|After his somber {{meeting with}} his chieftains, Haile Selassie visited Sir Sidney Barton at the British Legation. He spoke softly to Sir Sidney but to the point.

25|$|Always a confrontational {{critic of}} antisemitism, Zissu found himself marginalized by fascist {{regimes in the}} late 1930s {{and for most of}} World War II.

His contribution {{is at the center of}} an enduring controversy, focusing on his alleged favoritism of Zionist Jews and his cantankerousness.|$|E

25|$|The ITU {{executive}} council subsequently required president Robert McMichen {{to enter into}} merger talks with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.
