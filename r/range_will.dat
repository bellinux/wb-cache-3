25|$|The two's {{complement}} {{of the minimum}} number in the <b>range</b> <b>will</b> not have the desired effect of negating the number. For example, the two's {{complement of}} −128 in an 8-bit system results in the same binary number.

25|$|Hornby {{introduced}} Mk.2 BFK and TSO {{models in}} the late 1960s and these have remained in production intermittently ever since, sometimes being used to represent coaches of later variants (such as the Mk.2B BFK in the Royal Train). In 2013 (for the 2014 range) Hornby {{announced that it would}} produce the Mk2E variant. These are re-tooled versions and will be available in both their main range and their RailRoad range. Some from the main <b>range</b> <b>will</b> have interior lighting. Hornby are making 3 versions of the Mk2E i.e. FO, TSO and BSO.|$|E
25|$|A retinal burn {{resulting}} in permanent damage from scarring is also {{caused by the}} concentration of direct thermal energy on the retina by the lens. It will occur only when the fireball is actually in the individual's field of vision and would be a relatively uncommon injury. Retinal burns may be sustained at considerable distances from the explosion. The height of burst, and apparent size of the fireball, a function of yield and <b>range</b> <b>will</b> determine the degree and extent of retinal scarring. A scar in the central visual field would be more debilitating. Generally, a limited visual field defect, which will be barely noticeable, {{is all that is}} likely to occur.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1990s, {{virtually}} all AAV biology was studied using AAV serotype 2. However, AAV is highly prevalent in humans and other primates and several serotypes have been isolated from various tissue samples. Serotypes 2, 3, 5, and 6 {{were discovered in}} human cells, AAV serotypes 1, 4, and 7–11 in nonhuman primate samples. As of 2006 there have been 11 AAV serotypes described, the 11th in 2004. AAV capsid proteins contain 12 hypervariable surface regions, with most variability occurring in the threefold proximal peaks, but the parvovirus genome in general presents highly conserved replication and structural genes across serotypes. All of the known serotypes can infect cells from multiple diverse tissue types. Tissue specificity {{is determined by the}} capsid serotype and pseudotyping of AAV vectors to alter their tropism <b>range</b> <b>will</b> likely be important to their use in therapy.|$|E

25|$|Occasionally {{confusion}} {{has arisen}} due to Marshall's method of naming each amp model, especially {{during its first}} few decades, when it was distributed under Rose-Morris. Early Amplifier models were simply named after their catalogue number, so for example the 1962 blues breaker was item one thousand nine hundred and sixty two in the Rose-Morris catalogue. Later amplifiers were given range designations as well as model numbers, which often indicated information about the amplifier itself, for example the JCM2000 range of amplifiers had models such as the TSL100 (Triple Super Lead 100W) and combo amplifiers like the TSL122 (Triple Super Lead with 2×12-inch Celestion speakers) other product ranges use similar descriptive model numbers. Often Speaker cabinets designed to suit a particular <b>range</b> <b>will</b> give a prefix before the speaker description such as JVMC212 (JVM cabinet 2×12-inch Celestion speakers) or a suffix C to denote a combo variant of an amplifier such as the Vintage Modern 2266C (Vintage Modern 2 channel 2× KT66 valves Combo).|$|E
25|$|In every lens there is, {{corresponding}} {{to a given}} apertal ratio (that is, {{the ratio of the}} diameter of the stop to the focal length), a certain distance of a near object from it, between which and infinity all objects are in equally good focus. For instance, in a single view lens of 6 inch focus, with a 1/4 in. stop (apertal ratio one-twenty-fourth), all objects situated at distances lying between 20 feet from the lens and an infinite distance from it (a fixed star, for instance) are in equally good focus. Twenty feet is therefore called the 'focal range' of the lens when this stop is used. The focal range is consequently the distance of the nearest object, which will be in good focus when the ground glass is adjusted for an extremely distant object. In the same lens, the focal <b>range</b> <b>will</b> depend upon the size of the diaphragm used, while in different lenses having the same apertal ratio the focal ranges will be greater as the focal length of the lens is increased. The terms 'apertal ratio' and 'focal range' have not come into general use, but it is very desirable that they should, in order to prevent ambiguity and circumlocution when treating of the properties of photographic lenses.|$|E
500|$|Current {{conservation}} efforts often focus on educating ranch owners and promoting ecotourism. The jaguar is generally {{defined as an}} umbrella species – its home range and habitat requirements are sufficiently broad that, if protected, numerous other species of smaller <b>range</b> <b>will</b> also be protected. Umbrella species serve as [...] "mobile links" [...] at the landscape scale, in the jaguar's case through predation. Conservation organizations may thus focus on providing viable, connected habitat for the jaguar, with the knowledge other species will also benefit.|$|E
2500|$|Quoted {{accuracy}} is specified as being {{that of the}} lower millivolt (mV) DC range, and {{is known as the}} [...] "basic DC volts accuracy" [...] figure.

500|$|The fair catch kick has {{its origins}} in rugby football. The rule is {{considered}} to be obscure and unusual, as most fair catches are made well out of field goal range, and in most cases a team that has a fair catch within theoretical <b>range</b> <b>will</b> attempt a normal drive to score a touchdown. [...] The fair catch kick is generally used when a team has fair caught a ball within field goal range and there is insufficient time to score a touchdown. At the professional level, the last successful fair catch kick was made in 1976.|$|E
500|$|Stars with {{an initial}} mass up to about 90 times the sun, or a little less at high metallicity, are {{expected}} {{to result in a}} Type II-P supernova which is the most commonly observed type.

500|$|In 2010 Airbus {{offered a}} new version of the −300 with the maximum gross weight {{increased}} by two tonnes to 235 t. This enabled 120nmi extension of the range as well as 1.2 t increase in payload. In mid-2012, Airbus proposed another increase of the maximum gross weight to 240 t. It is planned to be implemented by mid-2015. This −300 version will have the range extended by 400nmi and will carry 5 t more payload. It will include engine and aerodynamic improvements reducing its fuel burn by about 2%. In November 2012, it was further announced that the gross weight will increase from 235 t to 242 t, and the <b>range</b> <b>will</b> increase by [...] to [...] Airbus is also planning to activate the central fuel tank for the first time for the −300 model.|$|E

50|$|Responses {{between males}} and females change {{cyclically}} as a female passes through estrus. Continuous proximity of the male may cause the female to stop cycling so, successful breeding demands that both sexes dwell separately, coming together for mating with only a brief paring interval.

500|$|The {{animals are}} {{vulnerable}} to bushfires due to their slow movements and the flammability of eucalypt trees. The koala instinctively seeks refuge in the higher branches, where it is vulnerable to intense heat and flames. Bushfires also fragment the animal's habitat, which restricts their movement and leads to population decline and loss of genetic diversity. [...] Dehydration and overheating can also prove fatal. Consequently, the koala is vulnerable {{to the effects of}} climate change. Models of climate change in Australia predict warmer and drier climates, suggesting that the koala's <b>range</b> <b>will</b> shrink in the east and south to more mesic habitats. Droughts also affect the koala's well-being. For example, a severe drought in 1980 caused many Eucalyptus trees to lose their leaves. Subsequently, 63% of the population in southwestern Queensland died, especially young animals that were excluded from prime feeding sites by older, dominant koalas, and recovery of the population was slow. Later, this population declined from an estimated mean population of 59,000 in 1995 to 11,600 in 2009, a reduction attributed largely to hotter and drier conditions resulting from droughts in most years between 2002 and 2007. [...] Another predicted negative outcome of climate change is the effect of elevations in atmospheric [...] levels on the koala's food supply: increases in [...] cause Eucalyptus trees to reduce protein and increase tannin concentrations in their leaves, reducing the quality of the food source.|$|E

2500|$|This {{analyzer}} crystal {{acts as an}} angular filter for {{the radiation}} coming from the sample. When these X-rays hit the analyzer crystal the condition of Bragg diffraction is satisfied only for a very narrow range of incident angles. When the scattered or refracted X-rays have incident angles outside this range {{they will not be}} reflected at all and don´t contribute to the signal. Refracted X-rays within this <b>range</b> <b>will</b> be reflected depending on the incident angle.
