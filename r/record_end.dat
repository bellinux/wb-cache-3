500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "We Want the Airwaves", which has {{instrumentation}} that strays from traditional punk rock and more so towards hard rock. Music journalist Chuck Eddy described the song as [...] "a sort of Black Sabbath punk rock." [...] Though rumors of the album's third track, [...] "The KKK Took My Baby Away", being about Johnny stealing Joey's girlfriend have circulated {{in the music}} business, the song was actually written some time before Joey had reportedly found out about this. Joey's brother Mickey Leigh relates: [...] "The fluky connection between Johnny and the KKK raised a specter that keeps friends and fans speculating to this day. At the time, though, {{it had to be}} an unusual situation for him being that, as often happens with song lyrics, his words now took on a whole new meaning." [...] The following track, [...] "Don't Go", was described in Musician, Player, and Listener as [...] "Spector-ish", referring to the song's high production value through Phil Spector, the infamous producer of the band's previous <b>record,</b> <b>End</b> of the Century. According to the book, the lyrics detail [...] "an archivist's sense of young love by the book and how innocent rock 'n' roll is supposed to sound." [...] Everett True, author of Hey Ho Let's Go: The Story of the Ramones (2005), explains that the album's fifth track, [...] "You Sound Like You're Sick", is very bass incorporated, saying that it [...] "returns to the bassist's traditional institutionalised theme." [...] Side A ends with [...] "It's Not My Place (In the 9 to 5 World)", which was described by music critic David Fricke to be [...] "driven home" [...] by drummer Marky's [...] "feisty, Bo Diddley-style" [...] drum beat, and noted that it borrows the middle eight (of thirty-two-bar form) from The Who song [...] "Whiskey Man".|$|E

50|$|SV is {{normally}} measured using an echocardiogram to <b>record</b> <b>end</b> diastolic volume (EDV) and end systolic volume (ESV), and calculating the difference: SV = EDV - ESV. SV {{can also be}} measured using a specialized catheter, {{but this is an}} invasive procedure and far more dangerous to the patient. A mean SV for a resting 70-kg (150-lb) individual would be approximately 70 mL. There are several important variables, including size of the heart, physical and mental condition of the individual, sex, contractility, duration of contraction, preload or EDV, and afterload or resistance. Normal range for SV would be 55-100 mL. An average resting HR would be approximately 75 bpm but could range from 60-100 in some individuals. Using these numbers, (which refer to each ventricle, not both) the mean CO is 5.25 L/min, with a range of 4.0-8.0 L/min.|$|E
50|$|Pepper Sound Studios was {{an early}} syndicator of radio station jingles and began {{sometime}} in 1957. It began as a record company created by businessman John Pepper and songwriter Floyd Huddleston. Huddleston based the company {{on the model of}} Capitol Records and even brought in Johnny Mercer as a consultant. Composers Al Rinker and Willard Robison were hired, until the <b>record</b> <b>end</b> was eventually phased out, and by 1964, Pepper Studios exclusively become a Jingle Commercial company. Their first jingle was for John Pepper's company Everdry Deodorant, followed by Burke Hall Paint and hundreds of others. William Tanner was a salesman for the company and quickly weaseled his way into becoming one of the owners of the company, and Pepper and Tanner worked Floyd Huddleston out. The company became known as Pepper-Tanner about 1967. In 1972, Bill Tanner worked John Pepper out the same way he had Huddleston, and the name was changed once again to The William B. Tanner Company, or simply Tanner for short.|$|E

40|$|Neodymium {{isotopes}} {{provide a}} paleoceanographic proxy for past deep water circulation and local weathering changes {{and have been}} measured on various authigenic marine sediment components, including fish teeth, ferromanganese oxides extracted by acid-reductive leaching, cleaned foraminifera, and foraminifera with Fe-Mn oxide coatings. Here we compare Nd isotopic measurements obtained from ferromanganese oxides leached from bulk sediments and planktonic foraminifera, {{as well as from}} oxidatively-reductively cleaned foraminiferal shells from sediment cores in the North Atlantic. Sedimentary volcanic ash contributes a significant fraction of the Nd when the ferro-manganese (Fe-Mn) oxide coatings are leached from bulk sediments. Reductive leachates of marine sediments from North Atlantic core tops near Iceland, or directly downstream from Iceland-Scotland Overflow Waters, <b>record</b> <b>ɛNd</b> values that are significantly higher than seawater, indicating that volcanic material is easily leached by acid-reductive methods. The ɛNd values from sites more distal to Iceland are similar to modern seawater values, showing little contamination from Iceland-derived volcanogenic material.

40|$|Underground miners {{are exposed}} {{to some of the}} highest levels of diesel {{particulate}} matter (DPM) in the United States. Therefore, it is important to monitor the exposure of miners to DPM, but it can be difficult because of the complex composition of DPM and the number of interferences. Currently, elemental carbon (EC) is used as a surrogate because it makes up a significant fraction of the DPM and is not affected by interferences. Standard measurement methods for EC can be time consuming and only <b>record</b> <b>end</b> of shift results. In this research, a laser absorption technique that enables one to measure EC concentration in near real time was shown to be a beneficial tool. The real time data showed that the fresh air being drawn into a stone mine was not properly reaching the working area and needed to be redirected to decrease DPM concentrations. The real time data also provided a more accurate efficiency ofan environmental cab compared to just using the standard method by detecting the opening of the cab's window and door. The EC optical monitor was also worn by researchers in a mine to show how it can give not only the average concentration for the shift but also reveal when and where a miner is exposed to DPM.

40|$|Background In 2010, after {{regulatory}} {{review of}} rosiglitazone licensing, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requested a reevaluation of cardiovascular end {{points in the}} RECORD trial. Methods Automated screening of the original clinical trial database and manual case report form review were performed to identify all potential cardiovascular and noncardiovascular deaths, and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke events. Search techniques were used to find participants lost to follow-up, and sites were queried for additional source documents. Suspected events underwent blinded adjudication using both original <b>RECORD</b> <b>end</b> point definitions and new FDA end point definitions, before analysis by the Duke Clinical Research Institute. Results The reevaluation effort included an additional 328 person-years of follow-up. Automated screening identified 396 suspected deaths, 2, 052 suspected MIs, and 468 suspected strokes. Manual review of documents by Duke Clinical Research Institute clinical events classification (CEC) coordinators identified an additional 31 suspected deaths, 49 suspected MIs, and 28 suspected strokes. There were 127 CEC queries issued requesting additional information on suspected deaths; 43 were closed with no site response, 61 were closed with a response that no additional data were available, and additional data were received for 23. Seventy CEC queries were issued requesting additional information for suspected MI and stroke events; 31 were closed with no site response, 20 were closed with a response that no additional data were available, and 19 resulted in additional data. Conclusions Comprehensive procedures were used for rigorous event reascertainment and readjudication in a previously completed open-label, global clinical trial. These procedures used in this unique situation were consistent with other common approaches in the field, were enhanced to address the FDA concerns about the original RECORD trial results, and could be considered by clinical trialists designing event readjudication protocols for drug development programs that have been completed. </p...|$|E
40|$|This issue {{continues}} the San Fernando accelerograms,and contains twenty records consisting of three records each from four buildings and eight ground level records. Some comments on these records and their digitizations follow. IF 086. Vernon. CMD Building. The complete record of 78 seconds was digitized. IF 087. Santa Ana. Orange County Engineering Building. The complete record of 81 seconds was digitized. IF 088. Glendale. 633 E. Broadway, Municipal Services Building. The complete record of 44 seconds was digitized. An aftershock triggered the instrument {{a second time}} and on some early versions of this record the two triggerings were run together as one record of considerably longer length. In this issue the aftershock is not included, but will appear as a separate record at some later date. IF 089, 90, 91. 808 South Olive St. Street, 4 th and 8 th Levels. All records continued for 2 - 1 / 4 minutes but were digitized for 59 seconds by which time the first aftershock had diminished. IF 092, 93, 94. 2011 Zonal. Basement, 5 th and 9 th Floors. All records were digitized out to the end at 34 seconds. The instruments on the 5 th and 9 th floors several times responded with a very high frequency, about 80 cps, lightly damped oscillation not associated with the usual building acceleration record. This particular vibration mode of the instrument is probably initiated by an impact loading on the structure near the instrument. Such impacts arise from dislodged material or equipment, or safety devices operating in elevator mechanisms. Through these sections of the record, usually lasting one or two seconds, the true acceleration curve was assumed {{to pass through the}} center of the high frequency record. IF 095, 96, 97. 120 North Robertson. Sub-basement, 4 th and 9 th Floors. The 4 th floor record was digitized to 59 - 1 / 2 seconds and the other two to the <b>record</b> <b>end</b> at 67 seconds. High frequency instrument oscillations were recorded on the upper floors in this building, as in the above building at 2011 Zonal. The particular instrument on the 4 th floor had a large amplitude at this frequency and consequently the selection of the central curve in this portion was more difficult than in the 9 th floor record. IF 098, 99, 100. 646 South Olive. Basement, 4 th Floor and Roof. The complete 56 second records were digitized. IF 101. Southern California Edison Co., Colton.
