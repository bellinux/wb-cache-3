In 2007, Indian {{exports to}} Burma totalled US$185 million, while its imports from Burma were valued at around US$810 million, consisting mostly of oil and gas. India has granted US$100 million credit to fund highway infrastructure projects in Burma, while US$57 million has been offered to upgrade Burmese railways. A further US$27 million in grants has been pledged for road and rail projects. India {{is one of the}} few countries that has provided military assistance to the Burmese junta.
