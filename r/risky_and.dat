5|$|Even {{before his}} {{accession}} {{to the throne}} of Belgium in 1865, the future king Leopold II began lobbying leading Belgian politicians to create a colonial empire in the Far East or Africa, which would expand and enhance Belgian prestige.

Castelli argued that it was urgent to rise against Lima because its economy depended largely on those districts, and if they lost power over that area, the main royalist stronghold would be threatened. The plan was rejected as too <b>risky,</b> <b>and</b> Castelli complied with the original orders.|$|E

5|$|In general, {{those in}} Europe who own {{large amounts of}} euros are served by high {{stability}} and low inflation. Those who now need to earn euros including countries, which need to pay interest on large debts, are likely better served with a slightly weaker euro leading to more export because a lower euro would better see investors chances for (companies in) southern European countries to grow themselves out of the crisis. As a result, investing there would become less <b>risky</b> <b>and</b> push interest rates for southern countries {{more in line with}} the European average.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February, several {{news outlets}} {{reported}} that JAL would decide {{to keep its}} alliance with American Airlines and end talks with Delta.

5|$|Driberg made {{no secret}} of his homosexuality, which he practised {{throughout}} his life despite its being a criminal offence in Britain until 1967; his ability to avoid any consequences for his <b>risky</b> <b>and</b> often brazen behaviour baffled his friends and colleagues.

He combined this lifestyle with an unwavering devotion to Anglo-Catholicism. After his death, allegations were published about his role over many years as an MI5 informant, a KGB agent, or both. The extent and nature of Driberg's involvement with these agencies remain uncertain.|$|E
40|$|Cataloged from PDF {{version of}} article. There {{is a great}} {{literature}} devoted to link between inflation uncertainty and interest rates. However, there are opposing findings {{about the relationship between}} inflation uncertainty and interest rates. Some of the studies find a positive correlation between them, while some of them find a negative correlation. In this paper, we analyzed the link between inflation uncertainty <b>and</b> spreads among <b>riskier</b> <b>and</b> safer bonds within a model of a timevarying parameter model with an ARCH specification. We divided inflation uncertainty into two parts, structural uncertainty and impulse uncertainty, as indicated in Evans (1991), firstly. We estimated the relationship between these types of uncertainties <b>and</b> spreads among <b>riskier</b> <b>and</b> safer bonds, using USA data. The results indicate us that both structural and impulse uncertainties have significant relationship with spreads between corporate bonds, the <b>riskier</b> bonds, <b>and</b> treasury bills, the safer bonds. Especially having a positive effect of impulse uncertainty on spreads shows an important evidence for ‘Flight to Quality’ hypothesis. Güler, BülentM. S...|$|R

5|$|During World War II, American bombers {{such as the}} Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, Consolidated B-24 Liberator and Boeing B-29 Superfortress were {{protected}} by long-range escort fighters such as the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and North American P-51 Mustang. These fighters could not match {{the range of the}} Northrop B-35 or Convair B-36, the next generation of bombers developed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). The development cost for longer-ranged fighters was high, while aerial refueling was still considered <b>risky</b> <b>and</b> technologically difficult. Pilot fatigue had also been a problem during long fighter escort missions in Europe and the Pacific, giving further impetus to innovative approaches.|$|E
5|$|Early in the war, these {{aircraft}} {{were used}} primarily to conduct raids and gather intelligence on North Korean ground targets, focused on disrupting North Korean {{supply to the}} front lines. However, as soon as UN forces retreated to Pusan Perimeter following the Battle of Taejon, the Naval aircraft were immediately re purposed for close-air support and airstrikes against North Korean ground troops on the front. These missions were significantly more <b>risky</b> <b>and</b> the aircraft suffered much higher losses due to North Korean ground fire. On August 1, Sebille and his squadron moved to Ashiya Air Field and began conducting missions {{in support of the}} ground forces in Korea. By August 5, Sebille had accrued over 3,000 hours of flying time {{over the course of his}} career. During this time, the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron operated primarily out of Ashiya but also used airfields at Taegu and Pusan.|$|E
5|$|Following the station's closure, the Central Electricity Generating Board {{had planned}} to {{demolish}} the station and sell the land for housing, {{but because of the}} building's then Grade II listed status, they had to pay the high-cost of preserving the building. In 1983 they held a competition for ideas on the redevelopment of the site. It was won by a consortium led by developer David Roche and which included John Broome, owner of Alton Towers Ltd. This consortium proposed an indoor theme park, with shops and restaurants. At an estimated cost of £35million, the scheme was <b>risky</b> <b>and</b> would require over 2million visitors a year to make any profit. The scheme received planning approval in May 1986 and the site was purchased by John Broome for £1.5million in 1987. Work on converting the site began the same year.|$|E

5|$|Most {{important}} was French {{reaction to the}} attack. Gaddafi had possibly believed that, due to the upcoming French legislative elections, Mitterrand would be reluctant {{to start a new}} <b>risky</b> <b>and</b> costly expedition to save Habré; this evaluation proved wrong, as what the French President could not politically risk was to show weakness towards Libyan aggression. As a result, on 14 February Opération Epervier was started, bringing 1,200 French troops and several squadrons of Jaguars to Chad. On 16 February, to send a clear message to Gaddafi, the French Air Force bombed Libya's Ouadi Doum airbase. Libya retaliated the next day when a Libyan Tu-22 bombed the N'Djamena Airport, causing minimal damage.|$|E
5|$|The first ferries {{crossing}} the Dordogne were flat-bottomed boats driven by oars or keelboats {{driven by a}} sail. The passage was very <b>risky</b> <b>and</b> accidents occurred, especially during high tides and storms. From 1754, a cable ferry crossed the 550m wide river. The cable lay above the waters and stretched obliquely to the current. In 1821, the cable ferry {{was replaced by a}} two-part ferry powered by a carousel of twelve horses. The horses set in motion gears which in turn powered a large paddle wheel. In good weather, the crossing time was improved to 30–45minutes, but in bad weather the trip remained uncertain.|$|E
5|$|After Christie's {{return from}} his second combat patrol, Admiral Chester Nimitz {{recommended}} he and Lockwood meet in Brisbane and discuss joint submarine operations. During the visit, Lockwood and Christie discussed technical issues, {{as well as}} the establishment of advanced bases in Mios Woendi and Saipan. However, the meeting also resulted in some kind of personal rift between the two men. They had already clashed over the Mark 6 exploder and the Mark 14 torpedo, and some of Lockwood's staff believed Christie's ride in Harder was a <b>risky</b> <b>and</b> unnecessary stunt. After meeting with Lockwood, Christie met with MacArthur and related the events of Dealey's fifth war patrol to the general. MacArthur then decided to award Dealey a Distinguished Service Cross, and Christie the Silver Star. Additionally at this meeting, Christie found out his earlier recommendation for an army decoration to Griffith had apparently been blocked by Kinkaid. Despite Kinkaid's order regarding army decorations, MacArthur insisted on granting medals to the two men. Although Christie did not request the decorations, he was put on the spot and felt compelled to report the entire affair to Kinkaid. In the end, the general awarded the medals, displeasing Kinkaid.|$|E

5|$|Author Fred Brooks {{criticized the}} program's {{requirement}} for the Comanche {{to be capable of}} ferrying itself across the Atlantic as an example of excessive requirements being present in a project's design phase and of their costly repercussions. Williams observes that the Comanche's weight requirements were unachievable, and claimed that this was due to poor management, in which no party was allegedly aware of or in control of the rotorcraft's final weight; there were concerns that, when outfitted with actual equipment required for operations, the Comanche's engines would be incapable of lifting the total weight of the helicopter. Additionally, it has been claimed that it proved difficult to convince the Army that the program suffered from serious troubles while key individuals failed to realize the existence of insurmountable technical problems. Prized elements of the program, such as certain software capabilities and its integration, failed to foster confidence with Army overseers; several capabilities were viewed as having been unproven and risky, while the anticipated consumption of up to 40 per cent of the aviation budget by the Comanche alone {{for a number of years}} was considered to be extreme. According to Williams, it was concluded that the Army's aviation budget would be better spent on the delivery of less <b>risky</b> <b>and</b> more critical needs.|$|E
5|$|While Illustrious {{was being}} moved in {{preparation}} for her acceptance trials on 24 April, the tugboat Poolgarth capsized {{with the loss of}} three crewmen. The carrier conducted preliminary flying trials in the Firth of Clyde with six Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers that had been craned aboard earlier. In early June, she loaded the personnel from 806, 815, and 819 Squadrons at Devonport Royal Dockyard; 806 Squadron was equipped with Blackburn Skua and Fairey Fulmar fighters, and the latter two squadrons were equipped with Swordfish. She began working up off Plymouth, but the German conquest of France made this too <b>risky,</b> <b>and</b> Illustrious sailed for Bermuda later in the month to continue working up. This was complete by 23 July, when she arrived in the Clyde and flew off her aircraft. The ship was docked in Clydeside for a minor refit the following day; she arrived in Scapa Flow on 15 August, and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Lumley Lyster. Her squadrons flew back aboard, and she sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 August with 15 Fulmars and 18 Swordfish aboard.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{relationship}} between religiosity-spirituality <b>and</b> <b>risky</b> alcohol use {{is one of the}} most frequently studied topics in mental health, relatively little is known about how these variables relate to each other over time, especially during specific developmental periods such as the transition from high school to college. This study analyzed three waves of self-report data collected from a sample (N= 623) of college students over a two-year period. Analyses examined (1) the stability of religiosity-spirituality <b>and</b> <b>risky</b> drinking over the transition to college, (2) the magnitude and direction of relationships between religiosity-spirituality <b>and</b> <b>risky</b> drinking, (3) the degree to which third variables account for relationships between religiosity-spirituality <b>and</b> <b>risky</b> drinking, <b>and</b> (4) the degree to which observed relationships between religiosity-spirituality <b>and</b> <b>risky</b> drinking extend to multiple, alternative measures of these constructs. Religiosity-spirituality <b>and</b> <b>risky</b> drinking demonstrated a high degree of stability over the transition to college. Consistent with previous literature, religiosity-spirituality predicted risky drinking, but risky drinking did not predict religiosity-spirituality. Relationships between religiosity-spirituality <b>and</b> <b>risky</b> drinking were observed across multiple alternative measures of the constructs and remained significant even after controlling for race and conduct disorder symptoms. In conclusion, religiosity-spirituality is a stable and important correlate <b>and</b> predictor of <b>risky</b> drinking, as well as a potential target for prevention and intervention during the transition to college...|$|R
