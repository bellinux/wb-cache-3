5|$|Also {{called the}} Malagasy pygmy hippopotamus, this species was {{originally}} classified as Hippopotamus along with H. lemerlei, {{and indeed the}} two species were <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> same size.

5|$|Early {{in their}} development, T Tauri stars follow the Hayashi track—they {{contract}} and decrease in luminosity while remaining at <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> same temperature.

Also it was a centre from which troops could be sent to repel Scandinavian landings anywhere on the coast from the Trent to the Welland, to a large extent, by using the roads which the Romans had constructed for the same purpose.|$|E

5|$|Although a clear {{relative}} to the common hippopotamus, H. lemerlei was much smaller, <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> size of the modern pygmy hippopotamus. The largest specimens were 6.5ft (2 m) long and 2.5ft (0.7 m) tall. The ancestors of H. lemerlei may have been full-sized hippos who shrunk {{through the process of}} insular dwarfism. A similar dwarfing process has occurred with hippos in many Mediterranean islands such as with the Cretan dwarf hippopotamus or the Cyprus dwarf hippopotamus.|$|E
5|$|American goldfinches lay {{four to six}} bluish-white eggs, {{which are}} oval in shape and about , <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> size of a peanut. It is thought that they are laid during the night. The eggs are {{incubated}} by the female alone, though the male brings her food as she nests, and most mating pairs raise only one brood each year.|$|E
5|$|Because {{strontium}} is {{so similar}} to calcium, it {{is incorporated in}} the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in <b>roughly</b> <b>the</b> same proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region it came from. This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.|$|E

Heading ashore, the storm began to quickly deteriorate, and both the JTWC and the BoM declared it dissipated on 10 January as it continued southward. Throughout the storm's course, the JTWC's intensity estimates were below that of the BoM. Also, it is reported that the cyclone's presentation on satellite was not representative of its actual intensity.|$|E

5|$|During the day, {{the storm}} crossed 180°, {{entering}} the western Pacific basin and being re-designated as a typhoon. The storm tracked steadily northwestward, attaining a peak intensity of 125mph (205km/h), a high-end Category 3 storm, before turning {{back towards the}} east. The storm gradually weakened, transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September17 and again crossing the International Date Line. The system dissipated shortly thereafter over open waters.
