5|$|On 26 May, while <b>rounding</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} tip of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less accurate navigation methods. Navigation via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial navigation.|$|E

5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso {{relative to the}} bike. As mentioned above, the effectiveness of rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn relative to the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and <b>rounding</b> <b>the</b> turn.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a {{defensive}} injury crisis at the club, Carrick started the 2012–13 season as a makeshift centre-back. His inexperience in the role was exploited by Everton in the season opener, as Marouane Fellaini beat him to a corner kick to score the only goal of the game. He continued in the role for the next match against Fulham. He scored his first goal of the season in a 1–0 Champions League victory against Galatasaray, after series of ball movement leading to Michael Carrick <b>rounding</b> <b>the</b> goalkeeper to score with his left foot. On 24 November 2012, Carrick was left out the squad that defeated QPR 3–1, ending his run of 33 consecutive league starts.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} {{tropical storm}} status, the system {{took on a}} slower and more westerly path across the Bay of Bengal. Gradually strengthening, the system attained typhoon intensity (or modern-day Severe Cyclonic Storm-equivalent) at 00:00UTC on November26. Shortly after reaching this strength, the cyclone began to curve northward, <b>rounding</b> <b>the</b> western periphery of a subtropical ridge centered over Indochina. Due to the ridge's broad size, the tropical cyclone was steered generally due north rather than northeast. Gradual intensification continued as the storm progressed closer to the coasts of Bangladesh and East India. At around 12:00UTC on November29, the tropical cyclone made landfall near the border between Bangladesh and West Bengal {{at the mouth of}} the Hooghly River. At the time, the JTWC analyzed the storm to have had maximum sustained winds of 200km/h (125mph); this was the cyclone's peak intensity. After landfall, the storm slowly weakened over Bangladesh and was last noted as a cyclonic storm-equivalent with sustained winds of 110km/h (70mph) on November30.|$|E

5|$|Around an {{hour after}} the start of the race, three {{children}} were struck by car driven by one of the race officials on a side road from Quarter Bridge Road, near the finish line. None sustained serious injuries; two of them had cuts dressed, while the third rushed back to watching the racing. Another, more serious, accident occurred on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which had been transporting people up the mountain to watch the racing. A tramcar that had been descending the railway had broken down, and a second car had stopped close behind it. A third tram, on <b>rounding</b> <b>the</b> bend above them, was unable to stop in time and collided into the rearmost car, which was then propelled into {{the car in front of}} it.

5|$|Batavian {{control of}} the Dutch Cape Colony was a serious risk to British {{shipping}} <b>rounding</b> <b>the</b> Cape of Good Hope, and a substantial force under Sir George Keith Elphinstone was sent from Britain to eliminate it. Arriving in early August, Elphinstone initially attempted to intimidate the governor into surrender, but eventually authorised a landing at Simon's Town. On 7 August the expeditionary force fought a skirmish at Muizenberg and clashes continued throughout August. A major Dutch attack on 3 September was forestalled {{by the arrival of}} a large fleet of Indiamen carrying British reinforcements, and as these troops came ashore the outnumbered Dutch surrendered. A much-delayed Batavian expeditionary force, sent to retake {{control of the}} Cape, arrived in August 1796, but was out-manoeuvered and forced to surrender by Elphinstone at the Capitulation of Saldanha Bay.|$|E
5|$|Southwest of {{the city}} of Rexburg, the Snake {{receives}} from the right the Henrys Fork, sometimes called the North Fork of the Snake River. The confluence with the Henrys Fork takes the river southwards through downtown Idaho Falls, <b>rounding</b> <b>the</b> Fort Hall Indian Reservation and into American Falls Reservoir, receiving the Portneuf River. The Portneuf River Valley is an overflow channel that in the last glacial period carried floodwaters from pluvial Lake Bonneville into the Snake River Plain, carving out many topographic features and significantly altering the Snake River landscape. The Snake River resumes its journey westwards, then enters the Snake River Canyon of Idaho, where it drops over Shoshone Falls, a waterfall that marks the historical upriver limit of migrating salmon, and passing under the Perrine Bridge. Close to Twin Falls, the Snake approaches the southernmost point in its entire course, after which it starts to flow generally northwest.|$|E

5|$|The Action of 21 October 1794 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} between Great Britain and France {{fought off}} the Breton coast of France during {{the second year of}} the French Revolutionary Wars. French frigates had been raiding British Atlantic trade routes with considerable success since the outbreak of the war, and in response the Admiralty had formed a frigate squadron to patrol the French Channel and Atlantic coasts in search of French raiders. On 13 October 1794, the large, modern and powerful 40-gun French frigate Révolutionnaire under the command of Captain Antoine René Thévenard sailed from Le Havre for a raiding cruise against British trade routes in the Atlantic. Eight days later, while <b>rounding</b> <b>the</b> Breton headland of Ushant about 25– out to sea, Révolutionnaire encountered the British frigate squadron, commanded by Commodore Sir Edward Pellew, which had secured a number of victories over French raiding frigates during the previous two years.|$|E
5|$|When news of {{the arrival}} of Duperré's {{squadron}} reached Decaen at Port Napoleon, he immediately despatched fast couriers to Grand Port and ordered Hamelin's squadron, consisting of the frigates Vénus, Manche, Astrée and the brig Entreprenant, to make ready to sail in support of Duperré. Hamelin departed Port Napoleon at midnight on 21 August, intending to sail northeast and then south, down the island's eastern shore. On 23 August, Hamelin's squadron spotted and captured a British transport ship named Ranger, sent 24 days earlier from the Cape of Good Hope with 300 tons of food supplies and extensive naval stores for Rowley on Île Bourbon. On <b>rounding</b> <b>the</b> northern headlands of Isle de France, however, Hamelin found he could make no progress against the headwinds and reversed direction, passing the western shore of the island and arriving off Grand Port at 1:00 pm on 27 August.|$|E
5|$|After the cyclone {{bypassed}} Socotra, its convective core became better defined due {{to improved}} outflow. On 2November, Chapala entered the Gulf of Aden, becoming the strongest tropical cyclone on record in that region. At 12:00UTC that day, the IMD downgraded {{the system to}} a very severe cyclonic storm, after Chapala had been an extremely severe cyclonic storm for 78hours. The structure became disorganized that day due to increased easterly wind shear and interaction with the Arabian Peninsula to the north, causing cooler and drier air to enter the circulation. Around this time, the storm began moving more to the west-northwest toward Yemen, <b>rounding</b> <b>the</b> southwestern periphery of a ridge. Between 01:0002:00UTC on 3November, Chapala made landfall near Mukalla with winds of 120km/h (75mph). This marked the first hurricane-intensity landfall for Yemen on record, and the first severe cyclonic storm to hit the country since May 1960. According to the JTWC, Chapala moved ashore and immediately turned back over water, although the agency soon reassessed the center as being over land. Chapala quickly weakened over land, degenerating into a depression by 00:00UTC on 4November, and weakening into a remnant low pressure area three hours later.|$|E

5|$|At 06:00UTC on October27, the IMD {{upgraded}} Nilofar to a {{very severe}} cyclonic storm. The storm was rapidly intensifying at the time, after the wind shear had decreased, and the eye contracted to a diameter of 19km (12mi). At 09:00UTC on October28, the IMD upgraded Nilofar further to an extremely severe cyclonic storm. Six hours later, the JTWC estimated peak 1-minute winds of 215km/h (130mph); at the time, the agency anticipated further strengthening due to the favorable conditions and good organization. At 18:00UTC on October28, the IMD estimated peak 3-minute winds of 205km/h (125mph). At the time, it was the third-strongest storm on record in the Arabian Sea. On October29, Nilofar started weakening due to increased wind shear, and the convection diminished in intensity. At the same time, the storm turned northeastward while <b>rounding</b> <b>the</b> ridge to the east. Increasingly cooler and drier air, as well as cooler waters, caused the storm to degrade rapidly. The eye, previously small and well defined, dissipated by 06:00UTC on October29. Later that day, the center began decoupling from the convection, a sign of rapid weakening, and by 21:00UTC the IMD downgraded it to a severe cyclonic storm. Early on October30, the JTWC downgraded Nilofar to a tropical storm, and subsequently the circulation became exposed from the convection. At 18:00UTC that day, the JTWC posted their final advisory. Nilofar weakened further into a depression on October31, and soon after degenerated into a remnant low off coast of the Indian state of Gujarat.|$|E
5|$|On {{arrival in}} Scotland much {{time was spent}} {{gathering}} Scottish troops together for the campaign on England and the French were delayed for some months collecting supplies. The army thus did not move south until July, ravaging villages and farms {{in the region of}} the River Tweed before besieging Wark Castle and burning it to the ground. The allied army then continued south through Northumberland and there burnt villages, towns, farms and castles across their line of advance in a large chevauchée. The English responded with an army led by King Richard II which advanced against the allied force and offered battle. The French prepared to fight but their Scots allies retreated, leaving the French exposed, and they were consequently forced to retreat as well. Outside Edinburgh the Scottish army dispersed and the inhabitants of the city fled north, leaving the French alone in the city. Realising that his force was outnumbered and without food or help, Vienne took the army south, <b>rounding</b> <b>the</b> English {{on the night of the}} 10 August and reentering Northumberland for further looting, attacking Carlisle but being unable to break through its walls. As the Franco-Scottish army returned northwards it was attacked by an army under Henry Percy which destroyed the army's wagon train and took many prisoners. When the defeated French returned to Edinburgh the Scots refused to provision the French army and many men died of disease or starvation. Late in the year the French army boarded ship and returned to Flanders, bankrupt and defeated.|$|E
5|$|The ship briefly {{operated}} between Glasgow {{and other}} ports in Scotland for Hutcheson's West Highland Service {{before she was}} purchased in September 1861 by James D. Bulloch, the primary foreign agent in Great Britain for the Confederacy, to deliver the military and naval ordnance and supplies that he had purchased. To disguise his control of Fingal, and the destination of her cargo, Bulloch hired an English crew and captain and put out his destination as Bermuda and Nassau in the Bahamas. The cargo was loaded in Greenock in early October, although Bullock and the other passengers would not attempt to board until they rendezvoused with the ship at Holyhead, Wales. On the night 14/15 October, as she was slowly <b>rounding</b> <b>the</b> breakwater at Holyhead, Fingal rammed and sank the Austrian brig Siccardi, slowly swinging at anchor without lights. Bulloch and the passengers embarked in the steamer while Bulloch dispatched {{a letter to his}} financial agents instructing them to settle damages with the brig's owners because he could not afford {{to take the time to}} deal with the affair lest he and Fingal be detained. The ship reached Bermuda on 2 November and, after leaving port on 7 November, Bulloch informed the crew that the steamer's real destination was Savannah, Georgia; he offered to take anyone who objected to the plan to Nassau. However, all of the crew agreed to join in the effort to run the Union blockade. Fingal was able slip safely into the Savannah estuary in a heavy fog on the night of 12 November without sighting any blockaders.|$|E
