5000|$|Fig. 3 shows {{a typical}} Pulses Plus schematic. The pack {{includes}} diodes in each branch {{to minimize the}} possibility of <b>reverse</b> <b>charging</b> the cells. PTCs, or positive temperature coefficient thermistors act as resettable fuses. PTCs begin to get warm at a trip current. The warmth increases their resistance which produces even more heat, and the PTC quickly [...] "trips" [...] and shuts off most of the current. The PTC rarely trips in a typical ADCP pack, because the safety circuit is the primary protection against short circuits (defined to be any current above about 8 A). The safety circuit also turns off the pack before its voltage falls below a threshold. If the pack were allowed to fully discharge, one branch could discharge before the others, {{which could lead to}} the discharged branch being charged by the remaining cells. Any attempt to charge a lithium cell is potentially dangerous, and turning the pack off at about 75-80% of its starting voltage prevents this from happening. At this voltage, only around 3% of the capacity remains, but the remaining capacity still allows years for disposal of the pack before it discharges fully.|$|E

Q1 is on and connects the left-hand positive plate of C1 to ground. As its right-hand negative plate is connected to Q2 base, a maximum negative voltage (-V) is applied to Q2 base that keeps Q2 firmly off. C1 begins discharging (<b>reverse</b> <b>charging)</b> via the high-value base resistor R2, so that the voltage of its right-hand plate (and {{at the base of}} Q2) is rising from below ground (-V) toward +V. As Q2 base-emitter junction is reverse-biased, it does not conduct, so all the current from R2 goes into C1. Simultaneously, C2 that is fully discharged and even slightly charged to 0.6 V (in the previous State 2) quickly charges via the low-value collector resistor R4 and Q1 forward-biased base-emitter junction (because R4 is less than R2, C2 charges faster than C1). Thus C2 restores its charge and prepares for the next State C2 when it will act as a time-setting capacitor. Q1 is firmly saturated in the beginning by the [...] "forcing" [...] C2 charging current added to R3 current. In the end, only R3 provides the needed input base current. The resistance R3 is chosen small enough to keep Q1 (not deeply) saturated after C2 is fully charged.|$|E
