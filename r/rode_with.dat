5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp <b>rode</b> <b>with</b> the sheriff's posse {{attempting}} {{to track the}} stage robbers. Wyatt discovered an unusual boot heel print in the mud. The posse checked with a shoemaker in Bisbee and found a matching heel {{that he had just}} removed from Stilwell's boot.

5|$|A {{quartet of}} riders made the climb in second {{position}} on the road behind Pellizotti: race leader Denis Menchov, Danilo Di Luca, Ivan Basso, and Stefano Garzelli. Di Luca <b>rode</b> <b>with</b> a very high cadence {{in an attempt to}} separate himself from Menchov, but was unable to until the sprint for the finish line. By virtue of the time bonuses gained for third place as well as the gap on the road, Di Luca closed his deficit to Menchov to under 30 seconds.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the race}} started, 78 riders {{had signed up}} for the race. Eighteen of those did not start the race, so the Tour began with 60 riders, {{including}} former winner Henri Cornet and future winners René Pottier and Lucien Petit-Breton. The riders were not grouped in teams, but most of them <b>rode</b> <b>with</b> an individual sponsor. Two of the cyclists—Catteau and Lootens—were Belgian, all other cyclists were French. Leading up {{to the start of the}} Tour, Wattelier, Trousselier, Pottier and Augereau were all considered the most likely contenders to win the event.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{deployed}} his own forces {{along the}} whole length of Maxentius' line. He ordered his cavalry to charge, and they broke Maxentius' cavalry. He then sent his infantry against Maxentius' infantry, pushing many into the Tiber {{where they were}} slaughtered and drowned. The battle was brief: Maxentius' troops were broken before the first charge. Maxentius' horse guards and praetorians initially held their position, but broke under {{the force of a}} Constantinian cavalry charge; they also broke ranks and fled to the river. Maxentius <b>rode</b> <b>with</b> them, and attempted to cross the bridge of boats, but he was pushed by the mass of his fleeing soldiers into the Tiber, and drowned.|$|E

5|$|One {{of these}} was Brigadier General Frederick Lance of the 19th Lancers, and his wife, Gladys, {{returned}} to Britain with two Salukis from Sarona, where he was stationed during the post-war occupation.

5|$|While it is {{believed}} that they were not particularly numerous, the exact number of Hoosiers to serve in Confederate armies is unknown. It is likely that most traveled to Kentucky to join Confederate regiments formed in that state. At least one Hoosier, Sgt. Henry L. Stone of Greencastle, Indiana, <b>rode</b> <b>with</b> John Hunt Morgan when he raided Indiana. Former U.S. Army officer Francis A. Shoup, who briefly led the Indianapolis Zouave militia unit, left for Florida prior to the war, and ultimately become a Confederate brigadier general.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt and Virgil Earp <b>rode</b> <b>with</b> a sheriff's posse and {{tracked the}} Bisbee stage robbers. Virgil had been {{appointed}} Tombstone's town marshal (i.e., chief of police) on June 6, 1881, after Ben Sippy abandoned the job. However, Virgil {{at the same time}} continued to hold his position of deputy U.S. marshal, and it was in this federal capacity that he continued to chase robbers of stage coaches outside Tombstone city limits. At the scene of the holdup, Wyatt discovered an unusual boot print left by someone wearing a custom-repaired boot heel. The Earps checked a shoe repair shop in Bisbee known to provide widened boot heels and were able to link the boot print to Stilwell.|$|E

5|$|Kirchherr and Sutcliffe went to Liverpool in {{the summer}} of 1961, as Kirchherr wanted to meet Sutcliffe's family (and to see Liverpool) before their marriage. Everybody was expecting a strange beatnik artist from Hamburg, but Kirchherr turned up at the Sutcliffe's house at 37 Aigburth Drive, Liverpool, bearing a single long-stemmed orchid in her hand as a present, and dressed in a round-necked {{cashmere}} sweater and tailored skirt. In 1962, Sutcliffe collapsed {{in the middle of an}} art class in Hamburg. He was suffering from intense headaches, and Kirchherr's mother had German doctors perform various checks on him, although they were unable to determine exactly what was causing the headaches. While living at the Kirchherrs' house in Hamburg his condition got worse. On 10 April 1962, Kirchherr's mother phoned her daughter at work and told her Sutcliffe was not feeling well, had been brought back to the house, and an ambulance had been called for. Kirchherr rushed home and <b>rode</b> <b>with</b> Sutcliffe in the ambulance, but he died in her arms before it reached the hospital.|$|E
5|$|The team <b>rode</b> <b>with</b> heavy hearts at the Tour of California in May. It {{was their}} first event back in {{competition}} after their mass withdrawal from the Giro d'Italia {{the day after the}} death of team member Wouter Weylandt. The race paid tribute to Weylandt by holding a moment of silence before its first stage and allowing the Leopard Trek team to lead the peloton into the neutralized zone, as well as all organization, staff, and riders wearing black armbands. The team did not attain any victories in the race, with Gerdemann in 11th place their best finisher. Neo-pro Nizzolo took the team's lone win in the month of May, triumphing in the field sprint finish to Bayern-Rundfahrt's final stage.|$|E
