50|$|A {{graduate}} tax {{has also}} been proposed in Ireland. Since 1995, the Free Fees Initiative has meant that almost {{all students in the}} Republic of Ireland from the European Economic Area and Switzerland do not have to pay fees, with the government paying them on their behalf. However, they must pay a student contribution (formally called the student services charge and informally known as the <b>registration</b> <b>charge),</b> which for the academic year 2010/11 was set at a maximum rate of €2,000 (up from €1,500 in the academic year 2009/10). Many students from lower-income families can get grants to cover this and other costs (such as academic field trips), as well as a maintenance grant.|$|E

40|$|The {{determination}} {{of the level of}} student registration fees at colleges and universities in many cases appears to be made without adequate consideration given to probable enrollment responses and to the associated implications for tuition revenues. This study was aimed at reducing this information gap at Utah State University and focused specifically on past sensitivities of students from neighboring western states to changes in the nonresident charges at USU. The analytical framework employed in this investigation specified a causal link between the proportion of the college-attending populations from these states choosing to enroll at USU and comparative tuition levels. The empirical findings showed considerable variation among students from different states with regard to their adjustments to changes in the USU fee. These differences in sensitivities were interpreted as a reflection of the desire and ability of students to make substitutions between USU and alternative colleges {{in the face of these}} relative tuition changes. While it was expected a priori that students at different stages of their academic careers would exhibit some disparity in their responses to fee level adjustments- the study results offered no evidence that a consistent discrepancy was present. When data from the various states under consideration were aggregated and used in the estimation of enrollment response functions, the demand for admission at USU was shown to be relatively inelastic with respect to the nonresident <b>registration</b> <b>charge.</b> The empirical results suggest that while increases in nonresident tuition levels at USU may produce greater tuition revenues due to the inelastic demand, tuition policy does represent an important determinant of aggregate enrollment patterns. Furthermore, the data show marked variations among students from different states regarding their demand elasticities, suggesting that adjustments in nonresident charges could also be expected to produce a compositional change in the USU student body. The weight given to these considerations in determining the policy for nonresident tuition at USU must reflect the mangement objectives of the school governing board...|$|E
40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the human rights}} compatibility of bills recently introduced into Parliament. Executive summary This report provides the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights 2 ̆ 7 view on the compatibility with human rights as defined in the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 of bills introduced into the Parliament during the period 17 to 20 March 2014 and legislative instruments received during the period 1 to 7 March 2014. The committee has also considered responses to the committee 2 ̆ 7 s comments made in previous reports. Bills introduced 17 to 20 March 2014 The committee considered 22 bills, {{all of which were}} introduced with a statement of compatibility. Of these 22 bills, 13 do not require further scrutiny as they do not appear to give rise to human rights concerns. The committee has decided to defer its consideration of three bills. The committee has identified six bills that it considers require further examination and for which it will seek further information. Of the bills considered, those which are scheduled for debate during the sitting week commencing 24 March 2014 include: 	Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Classification Tools and Other Measures) Bill 2014; 	Clean Energy Finance Corporation (Abolition) Bill 2013 [No. 2]; 	Defence Force Retirement Benefits Legislation Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill 2014; 	Marriage (Celebrant <b>Registration</b> <b>Charge)</b> Bill 2014 and Marriage Amendment (Celebrant Administration and Fees) Bill 2014; and 	Omnibus Repeal Day (Autumn 2014) Bill 2014. Legislative instruments received between 1 and 7 March 2014 The committee considered 42 legislative instruments received between 1 and 7 March 2014. The full list of instruments scrutinised by the committee can be found in Appendix 1 to this report. Of these 42 instruments, 40 do not appear to raise any human rights concerns and all are accompanied by statements of compatibility that are adequate. The committee has decided to seek further information from the relevant Minister in relation to one of the two remaining instruments before forming a view about its compatibility with human rights. The committee notes that a statement of compatibility was not provided for this instrument as it is exempt from the statement of compatibility requirement under the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011. The committee has consistently regarded the preparation of a statement of compatibility for exempt instruments, particularly where they involve limitations on human rights, as a best-practice approach. In relation to the second remaining instrument, the committee has taken the opportunity to draw the relevant Minister 2 ̆ 7 s attention to the committee 2 ̆ 7 s views with regard to national cooperative schemes of legislation. Responses The committee has considered seven responses relating to matters raised in relation to bills and legislative instruments in previous reports. Of these, the responses relating to two bills and two instruments appear to have adequately addressed the committee 2 ̆ 7 s concerns. The committee retains concerns and/or has sought further information or the inclusion of safeguards in relation to two bills and one instrument. The committee will write again to the relevant Ministers in relation to these matters...|$|E

The dream of these people started about 12 years ago when they bought this land of each of about 1800 sq. ft. Their dream was to construct a house for their own and live a peaceful life gifted by god. That's why once they bought and registered the land in 1996 they did not look back. A few years later, about 2002, the real trouble started. The Andhra Pradesh government who actually registered this site by taking <b>registration</b> <b>charges</b> and so many other formalities, declared it as a government land again in 2002.

5000|$|A Cospas-Sarsat [...] {{distress}} beacon is a [...] digital 406-MHz radio transmitter {{that can be}} activated in a life-threatening emergency to summon assistance from government authorities. Beacons are manufactured and sold by dozens of vendors. They are classified in three main types. A 406-MHz beacon designed for use in an aircraft is known as an emergency locator transmitter (ELT). One designed for use aboard a marine vessel is called an emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB). And one {{that is designed to}} be carried by an individual is known as a personal locator beacon (PLB). Sometimes PLBs are carried aboard aircraft or vessels, but whether this satisfies safety requirements depends on local regulations. [...] A Cospas-Sarsat 406-MHz beacon does not transmit until it is activated in an emergency (or when certain testing features are activated by the user). Some beacons are designed to be manually activated by a person pressing a button, and some others are designed for automatic activation in certain circumstances (e.g., ELTs may be automatically activated by a physical shock, such as in a crash, and EPIRBs may be automatically activated by contact with water). There are no subscription or other costs imposed by Cospas-Sarsat for beacon ownership or use. (Some countries may impose licensing and/or <b>registration</b> <b>charges</b> for beacon ownership, and some jurisdictions may assess costs for rescue operations.) ...|$|R
