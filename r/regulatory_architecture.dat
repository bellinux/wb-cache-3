The extent of promoter nucleosome loss {{depends on the}} strength of the transcriptional activator of PHO 5, indicative of continuous disassembly and reassembly of nucleosomes at the induced promoter. PHO 5 promoter nucleosome loss and expression are exponentially related, pointing at two or more steps of the expression process that are activator controlled. The intrinsic noise profile of PHO 5 expression permits quantitative distinction between alternative <b>regulatory</b> <b>architectures.</b> The assumption of two activator-controlled steps, promoter nucleosome removal and assembly of the transcription machinery, is necessary and sufficient to account for the quantitative relationship between PHO 5 expression, intrinsic noise, and promoter nucleosome loss...|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 2013 How the {{interactions}} of transcription factors (TFs) with specific regions of chromatin control the basis for cellular function and identity remains an open question. Here, analysis of regions of accessible chromatin, which are identified globally across T cell subtypes, demonstrates that the chromatin of naïve CD 4 T cells is poised towards the acquisition of effector function. Additionally, the development of genome-wide maps of in vivo transcription factor footprints allows the assembly of extensive regulatory networks comprising connections among 476 sequence-specific transcription factors, demonstrating the dynamics of these connections across mature human CD 4 T cell subtypes. Well-characterized subset-specific TFs show prominent occupancy in subset-specific networks. Moreover, conserved <b>regulatory</b> <b>architectures</b> act through these subset-specific regulatory factors, to potentiate, rather than direct, mature CD 4 T cell differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Organisms rely on {{a variety}} of <b>regulatory</b> <b>architectures</b> to control gene transcription. Whereas the {{functional}} characteristics of particular architectures are well understood, the properties of newly discovered regulatory designs cannot be easily predicted. One emerging design depends on small proteins that connect two-component regulatory systems, which constitute the dominant form of bacterial signal transduction. These connectors enable one system to respond to the signal perceived by a different system. To understand the functional properties of such connector-mediated architectures, we investigated the pathway controlled by the PhoP-dependent connector protein PmrD of Salmonella enterica and contrasted it to the circuit in which genes are regulated directly by the transcription factor PhoP. The PmrD-mediated pathway displayed both signal amplification and persistence of expression when compared with the direct pathway. Mathematical modeling of the two pathways allowed us to identify critical factors responsible for signal amplification...|$|R

Today law is no longer centre stage but simply one instrument among others in the environmental regulator's toolkit. And talk of regulation may itself be giving way to the broader concept of environmental governance. This article examines the evolution of environmental law, regulation and governance over almost four decades. It explores the major initiatives of that period and the lessons that can be learned from them, it maps shifting <b>regulatory</b> <b>architectures</b> and explains what has worked and why and it considers the changing nature of the environmental challenge itself.

5000|$|The FRQ {{protein is}} conserved within the Sordariacea but diverges {{outside of this}} group. [...] Nonetheless bona fide FRQ-based {{circadian}} cocks {{have been found in}} organisms other than Neurospora both within the Sordariacea, for instance, in the salient fungal pathogen Botrytis, and also as far afield as Pyronema within the Pezizomycetes, an early-diverging lineage of filamentous ascomycetes. A {{part of the reason why}} the FRQ primary amino acid sequence diverges so quickly may be because it is an Intrinsically Disordered Protein and as a result lacks the structural constraints that limit sequence changes. [...] Since codon optimization of the frq gene results in impaired circadian feedback loop function, frq displays non-optimal codon usage bias across its open reading frame in contrast to most other genes. FRQ is an intrinsically disordered protein that is not well conserved, even across fungi. Unlike FRQ, however, WC-1 is very well conserved. It is the founding member of the family of blue light photoreceptors used in the entire Kingdom of fungi. Moreover, it is similar in structure and function to BMAL1. Casein kinase 2 is conserved in the circadian oscillators of plants (Arabidopsis) and flies (Drosophila). A similar form of CKI is necessary for the degradation of period (PER) proteins in Drosophila and mammals. The Drosophila gene slimb is orthologous to FWD1 in Neurospora, both of which are crucial for clock protein degradation. In general, the TTFLs found in fungi and animals share a similar <b>regulatory</b> <b>architecture,</b> with a single step negative feedback loop, PAS-PAS heterodimeric activators that are conserved, and negative element proteins that largely lack structure and are much less well conserved. A similar palette of kinases modifies the clock proteins in all cases.|$|E

One of the most common ways in which cells implement these decisions is through proteins regulating the process of transcription.

After giving an overview of the “by the numbers” approach to transcription, I will then highlight a three-pronged strategy for the study of this crucial part of the central dogma based upon theoretical modeling using the tools of statistical mechanics, single-molecule approaches which allow us to watch transcription factors one at a time and single-cell approaches which permit systematic measurements of the level of gene expression for a number of different <b>regulatory</b> <b>architectures...</b>|$|R

Based on a given metabolic model different computational {{tools for}} the simulation, data evaluation, systems analysis, prediction, design and optimization of metabolic systems have been developed. The currently used metabolic modeling approaches can be subdivided into structural models, stoichiometric models, carbon flux models, stationary and nonstationary mechanistic models and models with gene regulation. However, the power of a model strongly depends on its basic modeling assumptions, the simplifications made and the data sources used. Model validation turns out to be particularly difficult for metabolic systems. The different modeling approaches are critically reviewed with respect to their potential and benefits for the metabolic engineering cycle. Several tools are discussed that have emerged from the different modeling approaches including structural pathway synthesis, stoichiometric pathway analysis, metabolic flux analysis, metabolic control analysis, optimization of <b>regulatory</b> <b>architectures</b> and the evaluation of rapid sampling experiments...|$|R

Cells have therefore developed sophisticated signaling and regulatory pathways in order to cope with dynamic fluctuations of both resource and demand and to regulate accordingly diverse anabolic and catabolic processes. Intriguingly, these pathways are organized around {{a relatively small number}} of regulatory hubs, such as the highly conserved AMPK and TOR kinase families in eukaryotic cells. Here, the global metabolic adaptations upon dynamic environment are investigated using a prototypical model of regulated metabolism. In this model, the optimal enzyme profiles as well as the underlying <b>regulatory</b> <b>architecture</b> are identified by combining perturbation and evolutionary methods. The results reveal the existence of distinct classes of adaptive strategies, which differ in the management of storage reserve depending on the intensity of the stress and in the regulation of ATP-producing reaction depending on the nature of the stress.

40|$|Motivation: Stochastic {{promoter}} switching between transcriptionally active (ON) and inactive (OFF) {{states is}} {{a major source of}} noise in gene expression. It is often implicitly assumed that transitions between promoter states are memoryless, i. e., promoters spend an exponentially-distributed time interval in each of the two states. However, increasing evidence suggests that promoter ON/OFF times can be non-exponential, hinting at more complex transcriptional <b>regulatory</b> <b>architectures.</b> Given the essential role of gene expression in all cellular functions, efficient computational techniques for characterizing promoter architectures are critically needed. Results: We have developed a novel model reduction for promoters with arbitrary numbers of ON and OFF states, allowing us to approximate complex promoter switching behavior with Weibull-distributed ON/OFF times. Using this model reduction, we created “bursty MCEM 2 ”, an efficient parameter estimation and model selection technique for inferring the number and configuration of promoter states from single-cell gene expression data. Application of bursty MCEM 2 to data from the endogenous mouse glutaminase promoter reveals nearly deterministic promoter OFF times, consistent with a multi-step activation mechanism consisting of 10 or more inactive states. Our novel approach to modeling promoter fluctuations together with bursty MCEM 2 provides powerful tools for characterizing transcriptional bursting across genes under different environmental conditions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{intrinsic}} stochasticity of {{gene expression}} is usually mitigated in higher eukaryotes by post-transcriptional regulation channels that stabilise the output layer, most notably protein levels. The discovery of small non-coding RNAs (miRNAs) in specific motifs {{of the genetic}} regulatory network has led to identifying noise buffering as the possible key function they exert in regulation. Recent in vitro and in silico studies have corroborated this hypothesis. It is however also known that miRNA-mediated noise reduction is hampered by transcriptional bursting in simple topologies. Here, using stochastic simulations validated by analytical calculations based on van Kampen's expansion, we revisit the noise-buffering capacity of the miRNA-mediated Incoherent Feed Forward Loop (IFFL), a small module that is widespread in the gene regulatory networks of higher eukaryotes, in order {{to account for the}} effects of intermittency in the transcriptional activity of the modulator gene. We show that bursting considerably alters the circuit's ability to control static protein noise. By comparing with other <b>regulatory</b> <b>architectures,</b> we find that direct transcriptional regulation significantly outperforms the IFFL in a broad range of kinetic parameters. This suggests that, under pulsatile inputs, static noise reduction may be less important than dynamical aspects of noise and information processing in characterising the performance of regulatory elements...|$|R
40|$|Inducible gene {{expression}} based upon Tet repressor (tet regulation) is a broadly applied tool in molecular genetics. In its original environment, Tet repressor (TetR) negatively controls tetracycline (tc) resistance in bacteria. In {{the presence of}} tc, TetR is induced and detaches from its cognate DNA sequence tetO, so that a tc antiporter protein is expressed. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview about tet regu-lation in bacteria and illustrate the parameters of dif-ferent <b>regulatory</b> <b>architectures.</b> While some of these set-ups rely on natural tet-control regions like those found on transposon Tn 10, highly efficient variations of this system have recently been adapted to different Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Novel tet-controllable artificial or hybrid promoters were employed for target {{gene expression}}. They are con-trolled by regulators expressed at different levels either in a constitutive or in an autoregulated manner. The resulting tet systems {{have been used for}} various purposes. We discuss integrative elements vested with tc-sensitive promoters, as well as tet regulation in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria for ana-lytical purposes and for protein overproduction. Also the use of TetR as an in vivo biosensor for tetracy-clines or as a regulatory device in synthetic biology constructs is outlined. Technical specifications underlying different regulatory set-ups are high-lighted, and finally recent developments concerning variations of TetR are presented, which may expand the use of prokaryotic tet systems in the future...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe complex, {{partially}} redundant gene <b>regulatory</b> <b>architecture</b> underlying vertebrate heart formation {{has been}} difficult to characterize. Here, we dissect the primary cardiac gene regulatory network in the invertebrate chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The Ciona heart progenitor lineage is first specified by Fibroblast Growth Factor/Map Kinase (FGF/MapK) activation of the transcription factor Ets 1 / 2 (Ets). Through microarray analysis of sorted heart progenitor cells, we identified the complete set of primary genes upregulated by FGF/Ets shortly after heart progenitor emergence. Combinatorial sequence analysis of these co-regulated genes generated a hypothetical regulatory code consisting of Ets binding sites associated with a specific co-motif, ATTA. Through extensive reporter analysis, we confirmed the functional importance of the ATTA co-motif in primary heart progenitor gene regulation. We then used the Ets/ATTA combination motif to successfully predict a number of additional heart progenitor gene regulatory elements, including an intronic element driving expression of the core conserved cardiac transcription factor, GATAa. This work significantly advances our understanding of the Ciona heart gene network. Furthermore, this work has begun to elucidate the precise <b>regulatory</b> <b>architecture</b> underlying the conserved, primary role of FGF/Ets in chordate heart lineage specification...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn early Drosophila embryos, the {{transcription}} factor Dorsal regulates patterns of gene expression and cell fate specification along the dorsal–ventral axis. How gene expression is produced within the broad lateral {{domain of the}} presumptive neurogenic ectoderm is not understood. To investigate transcriptional control during neurogenic ectoderm specification, we examined divergence and function of an embryonic cis-regulatory element controlling the gene short gastrulation (sog). While transcription factor binding sites are not completely conserved, we demonstrate that these sequences are bona fide regulatory elements, despite variable <b>regulatory</b> <b>architecture.</b> Mutation of conserved sequences revealed that putative transcription factor binding sites for Dorsal and Zelda, a ubiquitous maternal transcription factor, are required for proper sog expression. When Zelda and Dorsal sites are paired in a synthetic regulatory element, broad lateral expression results. However, synthetic regulatory elements that contain Dorsal and an additional activator also drive expression throughout the neurogenic ectoderm. Our results suggest that interaction between Dorsal and Zelda drives expression within the presumptive neurogenic ectoderm, but they also demonstrate that <b>regulatory</b> <b>architecture</b> directing expression in this domain is flexible. We propose a model for neurogenic ectoderm specification in which gene regulation occurs {{at the intersection of}} temporal and spatial transcription factor inputs...|$|E

40|$|Developmental gene {{regulatory}} networks robustly {{control the}} timely activation of regulatory and differentiation genes. The structure of these networks underlies {{their capacity to}} buffer intrinsic and extrinsic noise and maintain embryonic morphology. Here I illustrate how the use of specific architectures by the sea urchin developmental regulatory networks enables the robust control of cell fate decisions. The Wnt-βcatenin signaling pathway patterns the primary embryonic axis while the BMP signaling pathway patterns the secondary embryonic axis in the sea urchin embryo and across bilateria. Interestingly, in the sea urchin in both cases, the signaling pathway that defines the axis controls directly {{the expression of a}} set of downstream regulatory genes. I propose that this direct activation of a set of regulatory genes enables a uniform regulatory response and a clear cut cell fate decision in the endoderm and in the dorsal ectoderm. The specification of the mesodermal pigment cell lineage is activated by Delta signaling that initiates a triple positive feedback loop that locks down the pigment specification state. I propose that the use of compound positive feedback circuitry provides the endodermal cells enough time to turn off mesodermal genes and ensures correct mesoderm vs. endoderm fate decision. Thus, I argue that understanding the control properties of repeatedly used <b>regulatory</b> <b>architectures</b> illuminates their role in embryogenesis and provides possible explanations to their resistance to evolutionary change...|$|R

A molecular interpretation of these modes of specification of cell fate in the embryo is proposed, in terms of spatial modifications of gene regulatory factors. On this basis, classically defined phenomena such as regulative development and cytoplasmic localization can be interpreted at a mechanistic level, and the enormous differences between different forms of embryogenesis in the Animal Kingdom can be considered within a common mechanistic framework. Differential spatial expression of histospecific genes is considered in terms {{of the structure of the}} gene regulatory network that will be required in embryos that utilize cell-cell interaction, autonomous vs conditional specification and maternal spatial information to differing extents. It is concluded that the <b>regulatory</b> <b>architectures</b> according to which the programs of gene expression are organized are special to each form of development, and that common regulatory principles are to be found only at lower levels, such as those at which the control regions of histospecific structural genes operate...|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{fluctuations}} {{are known}} to affect dynamics of cellular systems in important ways. Studies aimed at understanding how molecular systems of certain <b>regulatory</b> <b>architectures</b> control noise therefore become essential. The interplay between feedback regulation and noise has been previously explored for cellular networks governed by a single negative feedback loop. However, similar issues within networks consisting of more complex regulatory structures remain elusive. The authors investigate how negative feedback loops manage noise within a biochemical cascade concurrently governed by multiple negative feedback loops, using the prokaryotic tryptophan (trp) operon system in Escherechia coli as the model system. To the authors knowledge, {{this is the first}} study of noise in the trp operon system. They show that the loops in the trp operon system possess distinct, even opposing, noise-controlling effects despite their seemingly analogous feedback structures. The enzyme inhibition loop, although controlling the last reaction of the cascade, was found to suppress noise not only for the tryptophan output but also for other upstream components. In contrast, the Repression (Rep) loop enhances noise for all systems components. Attenuation (Att) poses intermediate effects by attenuating noise for the upstream components but promoting noise for components downstream of its target. Regarding noise at the output tryptophan, Rep and Att can be categorised as noise-enhancing loops whereas Enzyme Inhibition as a noise-reducing loop. These findings suggest novel implications in how cellular systems with multiple feedback mechanisms control noise...|$|R
40|$|By {{integrating}} {{positive and}} negative feedback loops, biological systems establish intricate gene expression patterns linked to multistability, pulsing, and oscillations. This depends on the specific characteristics of each interlinked feedback, and thus one would expect additional expression programs to be found. Here, we investigate one such program associated with an antagonistic {{positive and negative}} transcriptional autoregulatory motif derived from the multiple antibiotic resistance (mar) system of Escherichia coli. We studied {{the dynamics of the}} system by combining a predictive mathematical model with high-resolution experimental measures of the response both at the population and single-cell level. We show that in this motif the weak positive autoregulation does not slow down but rather enhances response speedup in combination with a strong negative feedback loop. This balance of feedback strengths anticipates a homogeneous population phenotype, which we corroborate experimentally. Theoretical analysis also emphasized the specific molecular properties that determine the dynamics of the mar phenotype. More broadly, response acceleration could provide a rationale for the presence of weak positive feedbacks in other biological scenarios exhibiting these interlinked <b>regulatory</b> <b>architectures.</b> This work was partially funded by grants GV/ 2016 / 079 (GVA) and BFU 2011 - 24691 (MINECO).
