Using the kinematic-wave overland flow equation and a fractional dispersion-advection equation, a process-oriented, physically-based model is developed for overland solute transport. Two scenarios, one consisting of downslope and the other of upslope rainstorm movements, are considered for numerical computations. Under these conditions, the hydrograph displays a long-tailed distribution due to the variation in flow velocity in both time and distance. The solute transport exhibits a complex behavior. Pollutographs are characterized by a steep <b>rising</b> <b>limb,</b> with a peak, and a long, stretched receding limb; whereas the solute concentration distributions feature a rapid receding limb followed by a long stretched <b>rising</b> <b>limb.</b> Downslope moving storms cause much higher peak in both hydrographs and pollutographs than do upslope moving storms. Both hydrographs and the pollutographs predicted by the fractional dispersion model are in good agreement with the data measured experimentally using a soil flume and a moving rainfall simulator...|$|E
40|$|Karst {{aquifers}} {{are often}} classified as highly heterogeneous systems. Such systems are very complex {{to assess and}} model due {{to the presence of}} discontinuous porosity, large spatial variability of hydraulic parameters and the difficulties encountered in establishing the fundamental spatial properties of the system. In fact, karst aquifers have been studied and classified into groups based on several methods such as chemograph analysis (monitoring water quality variations at springs), linear systems analysis (kernel functions and time moment analysis), heterogeneity ratio, recession hydrograph analysis and flashiness of an aquifer. All these methods have been reviewed, with emphasis on the fourth and fifth approaches because they are based on hydrograph analysis. The problem with these two methods is the fact that they do not take in account the duration time between the starting of the <b>rising</b> <b>limb</b> and the peak discharge and the duration time between <b>rising</b> <b>limb</b> and the returning to the baseflow condition. On these reasoning it may be argued that taking in consideration the whole hydrograph components (<b>rising</b> <b>limb,</b> peak and recession limb) could be used as bases to introduce a new parameter called Degree of karstification index (D k) Which then {{can be used as a}} measure of the karstifiaction of karst aquifers. Several sets of hydrograph data obtained from different springs have been analysed to determine values of (D k). The results have yielded values ranging from less than 10 where the aquifer is considered to be Darcian to more than 60 where the aquifer is assumed to be highly karstified. Application of such classification method may help to provide a basis for deciding whether to use Equivalent porous medium, fracture or conduit based models to simulate karst aquifers. ...|$|E
40|$|A physically-based {{distributed}} erosion model (MEFIDIS) {{was applied}} to evaluate the consequences of storm movement on runoff and erosion from the Alenquer basin in Portugal. Controlled soil flume laboratory experiments were also {{used to test the}} model. Nine synthetic circular storms were used, combining three storm diameters (0. 5, 1 and 2 times the Alenquer basin's axial length) with three speeds of storm movement (0. 5, 1 and 2  m/s); storm intensities were synthesized in order to maintain a constant rainfall depth of 50  mm. The model {{was applied to}} storms moving downstream as well as upstream along the basin's axis. In all tests, downstream-moving storms caused significantly higher peak runoff (56. 5 %) and net erosion (9. 1 %) than did upstream-moving storms. The consequences for peak runoff were amplified as the storm intensity increased. The hydrograph shapes were also different: for downstream-moving storms, runoff started later and the <b>rising</b> <b>limb</b> was steeper, whereas for upstream moving storms, runoff started early and the <b>rising</b> <b>limb</b> was less steep.

Just after a dry season, with the start of rainfall (shown by <b>rising</b> <b>limbs</b> of the hydrographs in Fig.  6 a), SD begins to decrease from its maximum.

Method (3) is computationally intensive and it does not solve the limitations of method (2) mentioned above. In this study it has been found that the limitations of method (2) can be efficiently overcome by reducing the time step in the critical phases of the simulation so as to allow water level to remain within the domains of definition of the storage function and of the outflow rating curve. With this control, the Runge-Kutta method ensures robust and accurate descriptions of reservoir dynamics and it is therefore expected to be suitable for use in distributed catchment models...|$|R

Solute data from precipitation, throughfall, soilwater, and ground/till water indicated till water and near-surface soil waters as the controlling end members for stream NO 3 and DOC concentrations respectively. Streamflow concentrations of major base cations (Ca 2 C and Mg 2 C), which were assumed to represent water originating from deep flow paths, matched the NO 3 trajectory. These data suggest that streamflow NO 3 concentrations are derived from till groundwater and that DOC is derived from near-surface soil waters. We attributed the early expression of NO 3 to the displacement of till waters by infiltrating precipitation. In contrast, we hypothesized that the delayed DOC concentrations occurred with surface and near-surface runoff from near-stream wetlands/peatlands and isolated saturated areas that became connected only under conditions of maximum water content in the catchment.

30|$|The IC for the {{parameters}} of the response routine and the routing routine (Figure  7 c) is directly linked to the dynamics of the runoff peaks. The IC for PERC is higher in early winter, in the course of declining percolation from the upper groundwater box to the lower groundwater box. The three recession constants, K 0, K 1 and K 2, show very distinct patterns of IC. While the IC of the fast runoff component (K 0) is always very low, that of K 1 is markedly increased in the falling limbs of runoff peaks and decreases with very high runoff events. The dominant role of the parameter K 1 for controlling recession after peak runoffs underlines the importance of fast subsurface flow in the catchment. The IC of K 2, which influences the dynamics of the slow groundwater runoff, continuously increases during low flow periods, when recharge from the soil zone ceases and the base-flow from the lower groundwater box becomes the main runoff source. UZL becomes somewhat better identifiable in late summer when the catchment is already relatively wet from the summer rains, and additional precipitation causes the upper groundwater box to exceed the threshold filling UZL and initiates fast runoff. Not surprisingly, the routing parameter MAXBAS is more identifiable during pronounced runoff peaks following snow melt and in the wet season, especially in the <b>rising</b> <b>limbs</b> of the runoff peaks.|$|R

In order to simulate the snow and/or glacier melt dominated streamflow receding quickly during high-flow period but very slowly during the low-flow period in rivers in arid and cold Northwest China, the current one-reservoir baseflow approach in SWAT (Soil Water Assessment Tool) model was extended by adding a slow reacting reservoir and applied to the Manas River basin in Tianshan Mountains. Meanwhile, a digital filter program was employed to separate baseflow from streamflow records for comparisons. Results indicated that the two-reservoir method yielded much better results than the one-reservoir one in reproducing streamflow processes, and the low-flow estimation was improved markedly. Nash-Sutcliff efficiency values at the calibration and validation stages are 0. 68 and 0. 62 for the one-reservoir case, and 0. 76 and 0. 69 for the two-reservoir case, respectively.

Water retention tests showed that the forest floor was capable of retaining large quantities of water, (mean saturation capacity was 481 % by weight, or 50 % by volume). Much of the water above its field capacity of 45 % by volume was held by large macropores which drained readily at very low tensions (0 - 20 cm water).

40|$|ABSTRACT. Heat flow in SW England is {{well above}} {{average for the}} UK as a whole, but northwards towards Bath and Bristol the values {{decrease}} rapidly. However, hot springs occur both in the Bath Bristol area and in mines in Cornwall. The development of hydrothermal circulation systems is thus not controlled entirely by geothermal gradient: {{the presence of a}} suitable fracture permeability is the main requirement. The thermal 'head' produced, which nevertheless depends upon the tempera-ture and volume of water in the system, theoretically can exceed local topographic heads even in areas of low geothermal gradient. Thermal groundwaters usually carry above average quantities of radioelements in solution because of the long residence times involved. 222 Rn values are often particu-larly high. High concentrations of 222 Rn in surface waters arise from the discharge of groundwater. The results of a survey of 222 Rn in streams in SW England have estab-lished areas of high values which are interpreted as <b>rising</b> <b>limbs</b> of convection cells with dimensions in the order of 5 - 10 km. In SE Devon 7 -ray spectrometry of soils shows two E. -W. belts of high activity. The northern is coincident with the faulted southern margin of the Crediton Trough, while the southern is coincident with the westerly exten-sion of the Abbotsbury fault system. Groundwater move-ment along deep-seated fracture systems is considered to be the explanation of these features. The horizontal scale of the area involved suggests that a thermal rather than local topographic head is the driving force. Groundwater circulation within fractures, driven by a thermal head, may therefore occur even in areas of low geothermal gradient and should be considered when selecting waste disposal sites...|$|R
40|$|With the {{recovery}} of the European beaver (Castor fiber) and their capacity to engineer fluvial landscapes, questions arise as to how they influence sediment transport, including the spatio-temporal trends and patterns of sedimentation in beaver ponds. The Chevral river (Ardennes, Belgium) contains two beaver dam sequences, which appeared in 2004. Volumes of sediment deposited behind the dams were measured, and grain-size distribution patterns were determined. Flow discharges and sediment fluxes were measured at the inflow and outflow of each dam sequence. Between 2004 and 2011, 1710. 1 m 3 of sediment was deposited behind the beaver dams, with an average sediment thickness of 25. 1 cm. The thickness of the sediment layer was significantly (p< 0. 001) related to the area of the beaver ponds. Along the stream, beaver pond sediment thickness displayed a sinusoidal deposition pattern, in which ponds with thick sediment layers were preceded by a series of ponds with thinner sediment layers. A downstream textural coarsening in the dam sequences was also observed, probably because of dam failures subsequent to surges. Differences in sediment flux between the inflow and outflow at the beaver pond sequence were related to the river hydrograph, with deposition taking place during the <b>rising</b> <b>limbs</b> and slight erosion during the falling limbs. The 7 -year-old sequences have filtered 190. 19 ton of sediment out of the Chevral river, which is of the same order of magnitude as the 374. 4 ton measured in pond deposits, with the difference between the values corresponding to beaver excavations (60. 24 ton), inflow from small tributaries, and runoff from the valley flanks. Hydrogeomorphic effects of C. fiber and Castor canadensis activity are similar in magnitude.

40|$|AbstractSeismic signals near rivers are {{partially}} {{composed of}} the elastic waves generated by bedload particles impacting the river bed. In this study, we explore the relationship between this seismic signal and river bedload transport by analyzing high-frequency broadband seismic data from multiple stations along the Chijiawan River in northern Taiwan following the removal of a 13 m check dam. This dam removal provides a natural experiment in which rapid and predictable changes in the river's profile occur, which in turn enables independent constraints on spatial and temporal variation in bedload sediment transport. We compare floods of similar magnitudes with and without bedload transport, and find that the amplitude of seismic shaking produced at a given river stage changes {{over the course of}} a single storm when bedload transport is active. Hysteresis in the relationship between bedload transport and river stage is a well-documented phenomenon with multiple known causes. Consequently, previous studies have suggested that hysteresis observed in the seismic amplitude-stage response is the signature of bedload transport. Field evidence and stream profile evolution in this study corroborate that interpretation. We develop a metric (Ψ) for the normalized magnitude of seismic hysteresis during individual floods. This metric appears to scale qualitatively with total bedload transport at each seismic station, indicating a dominance of transport on the <b>rising</b> <b>limbs</b> of both storms. We speculate that hysteresis at this site arises from time-dependent evolution of the bed, for example due to grain packing, mobile armoring, or the temporal lag between stage and bedform growth. Ψ reveals along-stream variations in hysteresis for each storm, with a peak in hysteresis further downstream for the second event. The pattern is consistent with a migrating sediment pulse that is a predicted consequence of the dam removal. Our results indicate that hysteresis in the relationship between seismic wave amplitude and river stage may track sediment transport...|$|R
