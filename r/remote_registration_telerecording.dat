40|$|Abstract: Voter {{registration}} {{is an important}} issue in election processes. In order to protect the election accuracy, it is necessary to have an accurate electoral roll of eligible voters. The electoral roll is usually constructed by means of a voter registration system that compiles voter data either in person or remotely. Current solutions for <b>remote</b> voter <b>registration</b> lack effective methods to prevent impersonation, multiple registrations and alterations on voter information. In this paper we propose a <b>remote</b> voter <b>registration</b> scheme that increases the accuracy of the current systems. In this scheme the voter identification is carried out by means of some biometric systems. Biometrics is also used to prevent impersonation, detect multiple registrations from the same person and protect from alterations of the registration information. ...|$|R

40|$|For <b>remote</b> <b>registration</b> {{of vital}} signs, non-invasiveness is attractive. The {{possibility}} of acute {{loss of consciousness}} threatens the lives of employees such as soldiers, fire fighters, police officers, and law enforcement personnel, who perform duties at hazardous or remote conditions. The brain cells die within three minutes after occurrence of hypoxia in cerebrospinal fluid. Consequently, acute occurrence of cardiac or pulmonary system failure reduces an employee’s likelihood of surviving {{due to the lack}} of ability for communication and the lack of ability for emergency calls. In the case of severe injury, a medic’s response time becomes a crucial parameter for increasing a person’s likelihood of survival. Continuous monitoring of vital signs therefore assists medics and employees by reducing response time to severe accidents. For detection of vital signs; electrocardiography, capnometry and pulse oximetry are being widely used as the golden standard for extraction of vital signs such as heart rate, respiration rate and blood oxygenation. But, these sensors require motionless attachment to specific areas of the body. The fact that employees are constantly in motion and sometimes covered by protection shields introduces difficulty concerning the continuous obtaining of vital signs.

40|$|Abstract—Feature matching, {{which refers}} to {{establishing}} reli-able correspondence between two sets of features (particularly point features), is a critical prerequisite in feature-based registra-tion. In this paper, we propose a flexible and general algorithm, which is called locally linear transforming (LLT), for both rigid and nonrigid feature matching of remote sensing images. We start by creating a set of putative correspondences based on the feature similarity and then focus on removing outliers from the putative set and estimating the transformation as well. We formulate this as a maximum-likelihood estimation of a Bayesian model with hidden/latent variables indicating whether matches in the puta-tive set are outliers or inliers. To ensure the well-posedness of the problem, we develop a local geometrical constraint that can preserve local structures among neighboring feature points, {{and it is also}} robust to a large number of outliers. The problem is solved by using the expectation–maximization algorithm (EM), and the closed-form solutions of both rigid and nonrigid transformations are derived in the maximization step. In the nonrigid case, we model the transformation between images in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and a sparse approximation is applied to the transformation that reduces the method computation complex-ity to linearithmic. Extensive experiments on real remote sensing images demonstrate accurate results of LLT, which outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, particularly in the case of severe outliers (even up to 80 %).

40|$|Abstract- Multispectral {{satellite}} imagery registration {{is a fundamental}} step for remote sensing applications such as global change detection, feature classification, and image fusion. Since image registration via the manual selection of control points is a repetitive and time-intensive task, a more efficient automatic coarse-to-fine algorithm for multispectral <b>remote</b> sensing image <b>registration</b> is proposed in this paper. First, for the coarse registration, the Haar Wavelet Transform (HWT) is adopted to produce lower-resolution levels of reference and input images; then, the Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) algorithm is utilized for quickly searching for matching points. After the coarse registration is completed, the Harris operator is used to extract feature points, and initial correspondences are established using the normalized cross-correlation to achieve the fine registration. Second, in order to remove mismatched points, the RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm is applied to putative correspondences. Due to large amount of satellite image data available, we used block processing in the refined registration {{to increase the efficiency}} in memory use. Finally, the final transformation function is obtained via the local weighted mean method {{in order to deal with}} local geometric differences between the reference and input images. Compared to global registration by manually selecting the control points, the proposed method is fully automatic and computationally efficient.

40|$|Given the {{influences}} of illumination, imaging angle, and geometric distortion, among others, false matching points still occur in all image registration algorithms. Therefore, false matching points detection {{is an important step}} in <b>remote</b> sensing image <b>registration.</b> Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) is typically used to detect false matching points. However, RANSAC method cannot detect all false matching points in some remote sensing images. Therefore, a robust false matching points detection method based on Knearest- neighbour (K-NN) graph (KGD) is proposed in this method to obtain robust and high accuracy result. The KGD method starts with the construction of the K-NN graph in one image. K-NN graph can be first generated for each matching points and its K nearest matching points. Local transformation model for each matching point is then obtained by using its K nearest matching points. The error of each matching point is computed by using its transformation model. Last, L matching points with largest error are identified false matching points and removed. This process is iterative until all errors are smaller than the given threshold. In addition, KGD method can be used in combination with other methods, such as RANSAC. Several remote sensing images with different resolutions and terrains are used in the experiment. We evaluate the performance of KGD method, RANSAC + KGD method, RANSAC, and Graph Transformation Matching (GTM). The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the KGD and RANSAC + KGD methods...|$|R
40|$|In {{optical image}} registration, the {{reference}} control points (RCPs) used as explanatory {{variables in the}} polynomial regression model are generally assumed to be error free. However, this most frequently used assumption is often invalid in practice because RCPs always contain errors. In this situation, the extensively applied estimator, the ordinary least squares (LS) estimator, is biased and incapable of handling the errors in RCPs. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} develop new feasible methods to address such a problem. This paper discusses the scaled total least squares (STLS) estimator, which is a generalization of the LS estimator in optical <b>remote</b> sensing image <b>registration.</b> The basic principle and the computational method of the STLS estimator and the relationship among the LS, total least squares (TLS) and STLS estimators are presented. Simulation experiments and real remotely sensed image experiments are carried out to compare LS and STLS approaches and systematically analyze the effect of the number and accuracy of RCPs on the performances in registration. The results show that the STLS estimator is more effective in estimating the model parameters than the LS estimator. Using this estimator based on the error-in-variables model, more accurate registration results can be obtained. Furthermore, the STLS estimator has superior overall performance in the estimation and correction of measurement errors in RCPs, which is beneficial to the study of error propagation in remote sensing data. The larger the RCP number and error, the more obvious are these advantages of the presented estimator...|$|R
