5000|$|The B120 {{commercial}} truck debuted in February 1971, {{based on the}} B110 passenger car chassis. The B120 used the same wheelbase and running gear of the Datsun 1200 sedans, coupé and wagon models. Initially it used the same stainless steel grille as the 1200 sedan, and the <b>rectangular</b> <b>gauges</b> of the Standard model B110s. Both regular (B120) and long-bed (GB120) models were offered. After the 1200 car series ceased production the B120 continued. In certain markets such as South Africa, the B120 was actually badged as the [...] "120Y" [...] and sold {{as part of the}} updated 120Y range. The B120 ute was sold in Australia until 1985. It was assembled locally and marketed in New Zealand during the 1980s in two trims: [...] "RoadStar" [...] and [...] "SportStar". It was capable of 49 mpg. B120s were not sold in North America, partly due to the US [...] "Chicken Tax" [...] and partly because perceptions of vehicle size meant that the 620/720 series were considered small pickups.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for the calibration of <b>thread</b> <b>gauges</b> on coordinate measuring machines. The procedure involves scanning of thread profiles using a needle-like probe, achieving traceability by substitution of different thread portions with corresponding paths on a calibrated sphere. The feasibility of applying the method to calibrate a parallel <b>thread</b> <b>gauge</b> {{with respect to}} all the relevant thread parameters was demonstrated experimentally using a precision CMM. Application of the comparator approach as described in ISO DTS 15530 - 3 gave measuring uncertainties comparable to the values from usual calibration methods on dedicated equipment, e. g. a measuring uncertainty of 1. 8 mum was achieved for measurement of the pitch, and 2 - 2. 5 mum for diameter measurements...|$|R

40|$|The article {{presents}} a methodology for modelling {{the control of}} a <b>threaded</b> plug <b>gauge.</b> There had been examined works of scientists who had studied the aspects of the average thread diameter control and studied the problems of providing and {{improving the quality of}} threaded joints.

The article shows possible applications of <b>threaded</b> <b>gauges</b> and examines the method of automating the average thread diameter control on a universal three-axis measuring video microscope.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} {{development}} {{and the application of}} the through-hole drilling method for the residual stress analysis in orthotropic materials. Through a systematic theoretical study of the stress field present on orthotropic plates with a circular hole, the relationships between the relaxed strains measured by a <b>rectangular</b> strain <b>gauge</b> rosette and the Cartesian components of the unknown residual stresses are obtained. The theoretical formulas of each influence coefficient allow the user an easy application of the method to the analysis of uniform-residual stresses on a generic homogeneous orthotropic material. Furthermore, to extend the method to the analysis of the residual stresses on orthotropic laminates, caused by initial in-plane loadings, an alternative formulation is implemented. The accuracy of the proposed method has been assessed through 3 D numerical simulations and experimental tests carried out on unidirectional, cross-ply and angle-ply laminates. © Society for Experimental Mechanics 2007...|$|R
40|$|For {{measurement}} of existing thread parameters using profile scanning, system error increases as pitch diameter, {{difference between the}} calibrating thread and measuring thread increases with the single gauge calibration method. There are several alignment deviations affecting the {{measurement of}} pitch diameter. To reduce the system error, a compensation method using two standard <b>thread</b> <b>gauges</b> to calculate the alignment deviations is proposed here. Finally, the theoretical and experimental comparisons between the single gauge calibration method and the proposed method are presented. The results demonstrate that the two gauges calibration method can effectively reduce the system error...|$|R

50|$|The 1961 {{model year}} brought a wholly new front end with {{free-standing}} headlights on short stalks in cut-away front fenders (a classical throwback favored by Virgil Exner, used commonly in the 1930s Chryslers. He would continue his look {{with the modern}} Stutz), and the largest tailfins ever. Inside, the Imperial gained an improved dash layout with an upright <b>rectangular</b> bank of <b>gauges.</b> The pillared four-door sedan was cancelled and would not return until the 1967 model year. With the downsizing of Lincoln, at 227.1 inches (later increased to 227.8 inches in 1963), the Imperial would once again be the longest non-limousine car made in America though 1966. Sales fell to 12,258, the result of bizarre styling and continued poor quality control.|$|R
40|$|Externally bonded {{composites}} {{reinforced with}} high-strength fibers are increasingly popular in construction, especially in structures’ strengthening, {{where the best}} possible mechanical properties are required. At {{the same time the}} ability to autodetect threats {{is one of the most}} desirable features of contemporary structures. The authors of the paper have developed an intelligent fabric, wherein the carbon fibers play the role of not only tensile reinforcement but also strain sensor. The idea is based on the construction of the strain <b>gauge,</b> where the <b>thread</b> of carbon fibers arranged in zig-zag pattern works as electrical conductor and is insulated by parallel thread of glass or acrylic fibers. Preliminary laboratory tests were designed to create effective measurement techniques and assess the effectiveness of the strengthening of selected building structures, as reinforced concrete and timber beams. Presented in the paper, selected results of these studies are very promising, although there were some noted problems to be considered in next steps. The main problem here is the control of the cross section of the fibers tow, affecting the total resistance of the fabric. One of the main deficiencies of the proposed solution is also sensitivity to moisture...|$|R
40|$|The shoes {{manufacturing}} {{implies the}} use of various types of leathers, leather substitutes and fabric. The sewing plays {{a very important role}} in shoe making, having an impact both in terms of functionality and outlook. One of the most important indicators of the sewed products quality is seam strength, which is influenced by a series of technological parameters such as: the shape of the needle’s top, the needle’s diameter, the seam thickness, the number of seams, the <b>gauge</b> of the <b>thread,</b> the type of seam and the material type. This paper studies the stitching strength of the full grain leather and full grain leather shiny surface used for footwear uppers, in order to improve productivity and seam quality. The experimental researches obtained for the stitching strength allow calculating the weakening coefficient of the material in the process of sewing (a= 0. 33 - 0. 48). The “a” coefficient is dependent on the stitch density, the shape of the needle’s top and the joined materials. In terms of stitching strength, the results indicate that the full grain leather obtains higher values than the full grain leather shiny surface. ...|$|R
