Restrictions have {{been placed on the}} construction of new churches, although existing ones are allowed to operate. The city of Shah Alam has not allowed any churches to be built. Christians are not allowed to attempt the conversion of Muslims and their literature must have a note saying it is for non-Muslims only. Similarly, the film The Passion of the Christ was restricted only to Christian viewers. In April 2005 two Christians were arrested for distributing Christian material in front of a mosque, although charges were later dropped. The <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> Malay-language Christian material is much less strict in East Malaysia than in the west. Good Friday is also an official holiday in East Malaysia, although not a national one.|$|R

40|$|Interoperability of {{software}} programs {{is associated with}} competition and innovation. This has resulted in exceptions to copyright protection for software interfaces and intervention by competition authorities. Despite this, the hidden and unreadable nature of machine code and the limitations of reverse engineering have given a much stronger protection than is normally associated with copyright. This article reviews the theoretical and empirical justifications for interoperability. Then, {{against the backdrop of}} the prevailing uncertainty pending the decision of the ECJ in the case of SAS Institute Inc v. World Programming Ltd, the author analyses the development of the law on the status {{of software}} interfaces in Europe and the USA. The effectiveness of compulsory disclosure of interoperability information under the “exceptional circumstances” test is considered but the shortcomings of this approach are identified. The possibility <b>of</b> relaxing the <b>restriction</b> on <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> interface information is proposed...|$|R

In [...] "Three Models," [...] three ways to govern {{cultural}} affairs are put {{side by side in}} detail: One with no formal rules at all, the current and one called [...] "Authoright," [...] corresponding to the nature of culture as it is developed in the previous chapters. It is concluded that copyright and Intellectual Property (IP) in general is a harmful way of governing culture. IP effectively inhibits creativity and promotes plagiarism and forfeit. It appears to be a hindrance of culture and culture based economy. One particular point is that IP effectively strips creators from incentives which is exactly the opposite to the claim. Removing <b>restrictions</b> for <b>dissemination</b> <b>of</b> cultural phenomena, on the other hand, promotes exposure of works of art and creativity in general which pertains to the economy of culture. In short, a brilliant work of culture in open access develops its market and thus provides a market share for the creator.|$|R

This model takes a systems-contextual approach, addressing program design, skills training, practitioner confidence and self-regulation, and workplace support.
