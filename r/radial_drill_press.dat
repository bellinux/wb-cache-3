5000|$|A <b>radial</b> arm <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> {{is a large}} geared head <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> {{in which}} the head can be moved along an arm that radiates from the machine's column. As it is {{possible}} to swing the arm relative to the machine's base, a <b>radial</b> arm <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece. This saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the drill head than it is to unclamp, move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table. The size of work that can be handled may be considerable, as the arm can swing {{out of the way of}} the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with a <b>radial</b> arm <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> but more often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture. Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common. Larger size machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the arm. The biggest <b>radial</b> arm <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> are able to drill holes as large as four inches (101.6 millimeters) diameter in solid steel or cast iron. <b>Radial</b> arm <b>drills</b> are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm. The length of the arm is usually the same as the maximum throat distance. The <b>Radial</b> Arm <b>Drill</b> pictured in this article is a 9-inch column x 3-foot arm. The maximum throat distance of this drill would be approximately 36", giving a swing of 72" [...] (6 feet)..|$|R
30|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>drilling</b> {{is already}} {{not a new}} {{technique}} in the petroleum engineering area. According {{to the state of}} art (Marbun et al. 2011), <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> is implemented through a special high pressure tube to form the water jet to penetrate and drill several lateral boreholes in one or several layers, which is an effective way to increase the drainage area and improve the oil recovery. Dickinson et al. (1989) first introduced the <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> system and predicted the promising expectation of this drilling system. Dickinson et al. (1992) presented two methods of combining water jet drilling and coiled tubing, and discussed their advantages and weaknesses in the practice. Yang et al. (2006) introduced the technique status in China and its application situation in Liaohe oilfield. Bruni et al. (2007) exhibited the <b>Radial</b> <b>drilling</b> technique in Argentina. Ursegov et al. (2008) presented the first results of cyclic steam stimulations of vertical wells with radial horizontal bores in heavy oil carbonates, and the results validated the wide usability of <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> technique. And Abdel-Ghany et al. (2011) stated the first <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> well conditions in Egypt. As for all of the researches above, most of them are just focused on the application status or the techniques of the <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> system, but almost no research was carried out to probe how to optimize the <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> branch length and branch number in terms of reservoir engineering respect, which is quite important for the multi-layer water drive reservoirs.|$|R
40|$|Tyt. z nagłówka. Bibliogr. s. 311 -[312]. The paper {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} results of <b>radial</b> <b>drilling,</b> drilling perforation, cumulative reperforation and acid treatment. The study was focused at carbonate deposits in Russia. For each technology average incremental oil rates were estimated at the same exploration targets. The analysis of technological effectiveness in the given geologic and physical conditions revealed that <b>drilling</b> perforation and <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> allow reaching higher incremental oil rates compared to acid treatment and cumulative perforation. This fact confirms effectiveness of <b>drilling</b> <b>radial</b> canals by enlarging infiltration area. For the sake of completion <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> and drilling perforation are performed in the same wells. To reveal limiting conditions of applying <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> and drilling perforation an effectiveness analysis is made depending on the thickness of the interlayers exposed. To formulate criteria of radial exposing applicability an analysis of effects of different geological and physical formation parameters on geological and engineering operations effectiveness is done. The following parameters are considered: relation between the current formation pressure and initial formation pressure, formation permeability, skin factor, thickness of interlayers in overall perforation interval, thickness of interlayers exposed by radial canals.

30|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>drilling,</b> {{also called}} ultra-short {{horizontal}} well, {{is a new}} kind stimulation technology, {{which can be used}} both in new and old wells to improve the productivity and oil recovery effectively. For the low permeability reservoirs, it had been widely used in practice to effectively solve the unbalanced displacement problems for the waterflooded reservoirs. Applying the multi-layer equilibrium displacement principle, the model of optimizing the <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> branch number and length for the high water cut low permeability reservoirs is established, and the corresponding programs are also compiled. Using the reservoir numerical simulation technology, this model is proved to be valid and accurate. This optimization method has been applied in Bonan fifth reservoir of Shengli oilfield, which exhibits quite positive results: higher average production rate and lower average water cut of the <b>radial</b> <b>drilled</b> wells.|$|R
50|$|For most drill presses—especially those {{meant for}} {{woodworking}} or home use—speed change {{is achieved by}} manually moving a belt across a stepped pulley arrangement. Some <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> add a third stepped pulley {{to increase the number}} of available speeds. Modern <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> can, however, use a variable-speed motor in conjunction with the stepped-pulley system. Medium-duty <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> such as those used in machine shop (tool room) applications are equipped with a continuously variable transmission. This mechanism is based on variable-diameter pulleys driving a wide, heavy-duty belt. This gives a wide speed range as well as the ability to change speed while the machine is running. Heavy-duty <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> used for metalworking are usually of the gear-head type described below.|$|R

This optimization method has been applied in Bonan fifth reservoir of Shengli oilfield, which exhibits quite positive results: higher average production rate and lower average water cut of the <b>radial</b> <b>drilled</b> wells. Hence, the <b>radial</b> <b>drilling</b> technique is suggested to be a great tool to solve the conflicts of layers {{for the development of the}} multi-layered reservoirs.|$|R

50|$|A <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> (also {{known as}} a {{pedestal}} drill, pillar drill, or bench drill) is a fixed style of drill that may be mounted on a stand or bolted to the floor or workbench. Portable models with a magnetic base grip the steel workpieces they <b>drill.</b> A <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> consists of a base, column (or pillar), table, spindle (or quill), and drill head, usually driven by an induction motor. The head has a set of handles (usually 3) radiating from a central hub that, when turned, move the spindle and chuck vertically, parallel to the axis of the column. The <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> is typically {{measured in terms of}} swing. Swing is defined as twice the throat distance, which is the distance {{from the center of the}} spindle to the closest edge of the pillar. For example, a 16 in <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> has an 8 in throat distance.|$|R
50|$|Geared head <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> are {{commonly}} found in tool rooms and other commercial environments where a heavy duty machine capable of production drilling and quick setup changes is required. In most cases, the spindle is machined to accept Morse taper tooling for greater flexibility. Larger geared head <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> are frequently fitted with power feed on the quill mechanism, with an arrangement to disengage the feed when a certain drill depth has been achieved or {{in the event of}} excessive travel. Some gear-head <b>drill</b> <b>presses</b> have the ability to perform tapping operations without the need for an external tapping attachment. This feature is commonplace on larger gear head <b>drill</b> <b>presses.</b> A clutch mechanism drives the tap into the part under power and then backs it out of the threaded hole once the proper depth is reached. Coolant systems are also common on these machines to prolong tool life under production conditions.|$|R
40|$|Construction workers {{frequently}} perform overhead drilling into concrete, {{which is}} associated with a high frequency of pain and disability, presumably due to high shoulder loads and awkward neck postures. My thesis involved the design and evaluation of an Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press,</b> an ergonomic intervention device for overhead drilling. In Study 1, I designed a new Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press</b> based on feedback from focus groups. I then conducted field tests to evaluate the intervention on construction sites and compare it to conventional overhead drilling. Results showed reduced fatigue, improved usability, and improved neck posture with the intervention. Elevated shoulder postures and drilling speed were not improved and reflected areas where the Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press</b> could be refined. In Study 2, I conducted biomechanical modelling to compare shoulder torques during drilling and to identify the optimal placement for the crank on an Inverted <b>Drill</b> <b>Press</b> in order to minimize shoulder torque...|$|R

50|$|A third type also exists, {{a lighter}} machine, called a mill-drill, {{which is a}} close {{relative}} of the vertical mill and quite popular with hobbyists. A mill-drill is similar in basic configuration to a small <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> but equipped with an X-Y table. They also typically use more powerful motors than a comparably sized <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> with potentiometer-controlled speed and generally have more heavy-duty spindle bearings than a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> {{to deal with the}} lateral loading on the spindle that is created by a milling operation. A mill drill also typically raises and lowers the entire head, including motor, often on a dovetailed vertical, where a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> motor remains stationary, while the arbor raises and lowers within a driving collar. Other differences that separate a mill-drill from a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> may be a fine tuning adjustment for the Z-axis, a more precise depth stop, the capability to lock the X, Y or Z axis, and often a system of tilting the head or the entire vertical column and powerhead assembly to allow angled cutting. Aside from size and precision, the principal difference between these hobby-type machines and larger true vertical mills is that the X-Y table is at a fixed elevation; the Z-axis is controlled in basically the same fashion as <b>drill</b> <b>press,</b> where a larger vertical or knee mill has a vertically fixed milling head, and changes the X-Y table elevation. As well, a mill-drill often uses a standard drill press-type Jacob's chuck, rather than an internally tapered arbor that accepts collets. These are frequently of lower quality than other types of machines, but still fill the hobby role well because they tend to be benchtop machines with small footprints and modest price tags.|$|R
50|$|A geared head <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> is a <b>drill</b> <b>press</b> {{in which}} power {{transmission}} from the motor to the spindle is achieved solely through spur gearing inside the machine's head. No friction elements (e.g., belts) {{of any kind}} are used, which assures a positive drive at all times and minimizes maintenance requirements. Gear head drills are intended for metalworking applications where the drilling forces are higher and the desired speed (RPM) is lower than that used for woodworking.|$|R
