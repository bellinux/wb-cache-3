40|$|In 2009, the Russian {{government}} set {{its first}} quantitative renewable energy target at 4. 5 % {{of the total}} electricity produced and consumed by 2020. In 2013, the Government launched its capacity-based <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> (CRESS), however, the Ministry of Energy (2016 a) expects it will merely add 0. 3 % to the current 0. 67 % share of renewables (Ministry of Energy, 2016 c). This raises the question what factors might explain this implementation gap. On the basis of field research in Moscow, the article offers an in-depth policy analysis of resource-geographic, financial, institutional and ecologic enabling and constraining factors of Russia's CRESS between 2009 and 2015. To avoid the trap that policy intentions remain on paper, the entire policy cycle – from goal setting to implementation – has been covered. The article concludes that wind energy, which would have contributed the lion's share of new renewable energy capacity, lags behind, jeopardizing the quantitative renewable energy target. The depreciation of the rouble decreased return on investment, and the local content requirement discouraged investors {{given the lack of}} Russian wind production facilities.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of the Directive 2009 / 28 /EC on {{the promotion of the}} use of energy from renewable sources was an important step for the successive contribution to the global Climate Change Regime as well as the diversification of energy supply, thus ensuring energy security and reducing dependence on external suppliers. However, although the Directive sets out legally binding targets for each Member State by 2020 as well as interim targets, it does not provide any legally binding instruments, i. e., renewableenergy support scheme(s), to achieve the above-mentioned objectives. Since the overall EU target as well as national targets are fairly ambitious, it poses a question, why the Directive does not include specific legally binding instrument(s) for achieving these targets, whereas the so-called flexibility mechanisms, provided in the Directive, are limited only to non-obligatory cooperation between Member States. It is important to mention that, during the negotiation process on the Directive,the harmonization of Member States' renewable energy policies through the EU-level mechanism of Guarantees of Origin was widely debated. Therefore, the intergovernmental negotiation on the Directive's provisions on <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> which should allow Member States to achieve their national targets as well as the overall EU target shall be submitted as the object of this article, while the purpose is to analyze the case of negotiating the EU-level <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> and to investigate the intergovernmental factors such as asymmetrical bargaining power of Member States aswell as specific domestic factors' influence for the negotiation's results, applying liberal intergovernmentalistapproach as the theoretical framework for analysis. The main tasks of the article are:__ to introduce the basic provisions of liberal intergovernmentalism and to formulate principal theoretical assumptions for further empirical analysis;__ to present a compact overview of the support schemes for renewables, applied in the EU;__ to define the role of the European Commission in the negotiation process, to determine the positions of the Member States on a common support scheme for renewable energy, to analyze the process of interest bargaining through coalition-forming and to detect the essential results of the negotiation. The main methods applied in this article include an analysis of the documents and the Member States' position papers, conducting a case study of the negotiation process on the mechanism of Guarantees of Origin as the common EU-wide support scheme for renewables in the Directive 2009 / 28 /EC on thepromotion of the use of energy from renewable sources. The article consists of three parts. The basic provisions of liberal intergovernmentalism as well as the principal theoretical assumptions are examined {{in the first part of}} the article as the theoretical framework for further empirical analysis. Renewable energy support schemes, applied in the EU, are presented in the second part and the case study of the intergovernmental negotiation on the pan-European support scheme for renewables based on the mechanism of Guarantees of Origin is carried out in the third part. The findings show that the majority of the Member States demonstrated strong opposition to the European Commission's proposal for harmonizing their renewable energy policies through specific pan-European support scheme, i. e., the mechanism of Guarantees of Origin. The Commission's initiative was rejected by posing an argument that the instruments for reaching the renewable energy targets must be selected according to the principal of subsidiarity with respect to each Member State's national specificsas only under these circumstances renewable energy support schemes could function in the most sufficient and effective manner. Therefore, the Commission's initial proposal had to be significantly modified thus abandoning the idea of the EU-level support scheme for renewables. The findings also verify theoretical assumptions based on liberal intergovernmentalism which postulate that the negotiation's results mainly depend on asymmetric bargaining power and the most powerful Member States' preferences determined by their national specifics, support schemes and other domestic factors...|$|E

We find that when exclusively high fixed-cost technologies comprise the eligible technology pool, the equilibrium form of contracting obviates the principal efficiency advantages claimed for certificate markets. When low fixed-cost technologies compete alongside high fixed-cost technologies in the certificate market, we show that it is likely that long-term contracts will disappear, and the technological choice will be inefficiently shifted away from the high fixed-cost technology. We consider evidence from three well-developed certificate schemes [...] in Britain, Sweden, and Texas [...] and find that it is broadly consistent with the theory here. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} fulfil the European Union’s {{renewable}} energy policy and its multiple objectives, the Member States of the Union have introduced national support schemes for renewable electricity. These support schemes are not harmonized, {{but they need}} to be carefully designed and comply with various aspects of EU law. This includes state aid concerns. Instead of following the Commission’s Guidelines on State aid for environmental protection and energy 2014 - 2020, which today guide the Member States’ support scheme design to quite a large extent, this thesis proposes an alternative way for Member States to comply with state aid law when support schemes for renewable electricity are designed. The aim {{of this study is to}} clarify whether schemes for the promotion of renewable electricity could potentially, as EU law stands today, be classified as services in the general economic interest (SGEI), and to clarify potential difficulties that a support scheme for renewable electricity would face in relation to material compatibility with EU law if it was classified as an SGEI. The idea of qualifying a support scheme for renewable electricity as an SGEI rests on the thought that the production of renewable energy might be viewed as a service of general or public interest. The objectives of a <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> <b>scheme,</b> and especially the environmental objective of climate change mitigation, could be seen as general or public interest objectives. While producing renewable energy, the energy producers might then be conceived as providing a service in the general interest, and the support that the producer receives under the support scheme would be seen as compensation for the service provided. An analysis of the position of SGEI under EU law, and an attempt to give a general definition of SGEI including some limits to this definition is made. Simultaneously, the possibility to fit support schemes for renewable electricity into the definition is analysed. The possibility to include renewable electricity in the concept of SGEI is thereafter gradually analysed by reviewing environmental SGEIs, the position of public service obligations in the Electricity Directive, and existing Union soft and case law dealing with the possibility to define a support scheme for renewable energy as an SGEI. The study shows that the possibility to introduce a support scheme for renewable electricity as an SGEI finds support in EU law, but the factual possibility to introduce a support scheme for renewable energy as an SGEI is circumscribed by quite a few restrictions and established SGEI characteristics...|$|E

Replicator dynamics algorithm is employed to simulate the bidding strategies of agents (generation companies) for profit maximisation. The operation process of a specified electricity market is simulated over a studied time horizon and some indices are employed to evaluate the market operation performance.

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of five essays investigating various aspects {{associated with the}} decarbonization of Europe's power sector and the politically incentivized expansion of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> generation. The first essay analyzes the economic implications of alternative decarbonization pathways and policy instruments for Europe's power sector up to 2050 and illustrates the importance of ensuring competition between all low-carbon technologies in order to limit the costs of decarbonization. The second essay analyzes the economic inefficiency associated {{with the concept of}} grid parity for the case of photovoltaic (PV). In order to both enhance overall welfare and avoid redistributional effects, the indirect financial incentive for in-house PV electricity consumption should be abolished. The third essay discusses the system price effect of wind and solar power generation and illustrates that the decrease in the marginal value of wind and solar power (as a consequence of increased penetration) is already highly relevant for both wind and solar power generation in Germany. The fourth essay adds to the ongoing debate surrounding the cost-efficient achievement of politically implemented <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> targets. <b>Renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> that fail to incentivize investors to account for differences in the marginal value of wind and solar power generation are associated with excess costs as they prevent the equalization of net marginal costs across technologies and regions.

40|$|Renewable {{electricity}} supply {{is a crucial}} factor in the realization of a low-carbon energy economy. The understanding is growing that a full turn-over of the electricity sectors by 2050 is an elementary condition for avoiding global average temperature increase beyond 2 Â Â°C. This article adopts such full transition as Europe's target when designing <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> policy. An immediate corollary is that phasing-in unprecedented <b>energy</b> efficiency and <b>renewable</b> generation must be paralleled by phasing-out non-sustainable fossil fuel and nuclear power technologies. The double phasing programme assigns novel meaning to nearby target settings for renewable power as share of total power consumption. It requires organizing in the medium term EU-wide markets for green power, a highly demanding task in the present context of poorly functional markets in brown power. The EU Commission's 2007 / 2008 proposals of expanding tradable certificates markets were not based on solid analysis of past experiences and future necessities. The keystone of sound policies on renewable electricity development is a detailed scientific differentiation and qualification of renewable electricity sources and technologies, for measuring the huge diversity in the field. We provide but structuring concepts about such qualification, because implementation requires extensive research resources. Support for renewable electricity development is organized via feed-in prices or premiums, and via quota obligations connected to tradable green certificates. Green certificates are dependent on physical generated renewable power, but separable and no joint products. Contrary to conventional wisdom we argue their separation in cost analysis but firm linking during trade. A few graphs illustrate the importance of assigning qualities to different renewable power sources/technologies. Feed-in systems based on an acceptable qualification perform generally better than certificate markets imposing uniform approaches on a very diverse reality. For a similar reason, uniform and undifferentiated taxation of non-sustainable energy sources cannot replace <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> capable of differentiation.

40|$|<b>Renewable</b> <b>energy</b> (RES-E) <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> {{have to meet}} two {{requirements}} in order {{to lead to a}} cost-efficient <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> mix. First, RES-E <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> need to expose RES-E producers to the price signal of the wholesale market, which incentivizes investors to account not only for the marginal costs per kWh (MC) but also for the marginal value per kWh (MV el) of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> technologies. Second, RES-E <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> need to be technology- and region-neutral in their design (rather than technology and region-specific). That is, the financial support may not be bound to a specific technology or a specific region. In Germany, however, wind and solar power generation is currently incentivized via technology- and region-specific feed-in tariffs (FIT), which are coupled with capacity support limits. As such, the current RES-E <b>support</b> <b>scheme</b> in Germany fails to expose wind and solar power producers to the price signal of the wholesale market. Moreover, it is technology- and region-specific in its design, i. e., the support level for each kWh differs between wind and solar power technologies and the location of their deployment (at least for onshore wind power). As a consequence, excess costs occur which are burdened by society. This paper illustrates the economic consequences associated with Germany's technology- and region-specific <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> by applying a linear electricity system optimization model. Overall, excess costs are found to amount to more than 6. 6 Bn e 2010. These are driven by comparatively high net marginal costs of offshore wind and solar power in comparison to onshore wind power in Germany up to 2020...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the impact of public environmental policy on technological change in the biomass-using industry and energy generation. The thesis contains an introductory part followed by the empirical investigation which {{is divided into two}} self-contained articles. One of the determinants of technological change is research and innovative activities. Article I studies whether <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> directed towards the production and usage of bioenergy have affected innovation with respect to bioenergy technology. A negative binominal count data model is employed analysing a panel consisting of 14 OECD countries over the years 1978 – 2009. As a proxy for innovation, bioenergy patents counts are used as the dependent variable explained by a set of policy variables as well as other determinants of innovation. The <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> policies investigated are feedin tariffs (FIT), <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> certificates (REC) and public investment <b>support</b> <b>schemes.</b> The results indicate that feed-in tariffs have had a positive impact on innovation but <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> certificates have not. The result regarding investment <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> is ambiguous since the dummy variable representing strong investment policies was statistically significant whereas the continuous variable for investment <b>support</b> <b>schemes</b> was not. Furthermore, the regressions suggest that market factors such as total energy consumption and electricity prices are important drivers of innovation within bioenergy technology. A concept sometimes used in order to empirically investigate technological change is productivity. Article II aims to disentangle whether environmental regulation has affected the productivity development in the pulp and paper industry through its impact on technological change. A dynamic panel data approach is selected analysing a sample consisting of the pulp and paper industry in eight European countries. Industry total factor productivity for the period 1993 – 2009 is used as the dependent variable and is explained by the intensity of environmental regulation {{and a number of other}} determinants of productivity. The results indicate that regulation of nitrogen oxides is associated with productivity improvements with a one-year lag, whereas regulations regarding sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide have not had any statistically significant impact. However, since increased regulation, as displayed by the chosen proxy, not only mirrors environmental regulation stringency, but also investments in new capital and learning which coincide with lower emissions, the positive result does not per see imply that the maximum growth has been reached. The results could therefore not be viewed as a proof of the so-called strong Porter hypothesis which postulates that stringent well-designed environmental regulations increase productivity growth compared to a no-policy scenario.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the effectiveness of}} feed-in tariffs for distributed generators, producing renewable electricity, depends on industry structure, i. e., vertical integration vs. unbundling. A stylized analytical model with a monopolist and a competitive fringe (distributed generators) will be developed to analyze the impact of feed-in tariffs on renewable power production. The vertically integrated monopolist maximizes profits by setting the electricity price for residual demand and a network access charge incurred by the fringe. The fringe receives a fixed feed-in tariff per unit of electricity produced. Under vertical integration, {{a rise in the}} feed-in tariff induces the monopolist to raise access charges for fringe firms and skim part of their additional income. This partially offsets the supply increase of the fringe firms stimulated by the feed-in tariff. However, in the case of effective unbundling with an externally set access charge, there is no possibility for the monopolist to extract part of the fringe's profit. Then, the feed-in tariff fully accrues to the competitive fringe, and its supply will further increase. This setting will be extended to horizontal expansion when the monopolist also enters the renewable production segment. The effects on prices and output will be derived and compared. <b>Renewable</b> <b>energy</b> Vertical integration <b>Support</b> <b>schemes...</b>|$|R

Therefore, they need to evaluate the likelihood of potential subsidy retractions and revisions, and take it into account when making an investment decision. The main {{purpose of this paper}} is to examine how investment behavior is affected by updating a subjective belief on the timing of a subsidy revision. We incorporate Bayesian learning into a real options modeling approach. Subsidies in the form of fixed feed-in tariffs (FIT) are considered, and we analyze a scenario where a retroactive downward adjustment of the FIT is expected through a regime switching model. We find that investors are less likely to invest when the arrival rate of a policy change increases. Further, investors prefer a lower FIT with a long expected lifespan, while policy makers prefer a higher FIT with shorter life span. In addition, we consider an extension of our model where a FIT scheme is retroactively retracted and followed by a regime under which electricity is sold on a free market. We find that if policy uncertainty is high, an increase in the FIT will be less effective at accelerating investments. However, if policy risk is low, FIT schemes can be very effective for accelerating investment, even in highly volatile electricity markets...|$|R

However, the design of the Russian mechanism has received only modest attention in the academic and the business literature. The main purpose of this research is to analyze the effects of the Russian <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> mechanism on investment profitability. This thesis is a collection of publications linked by a common theme of studying <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> profitability under the Russian support mechanism. In the efforts to analyze the Russian <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> mechanism, this research applies several investment analysis techniques, including traditional capital budgeting analysis, sensitivity analysis, simulation-based and fuzzy set theory-based real options approaches. To enhance the information content and analytical power of the simulation-based real options approach, this research introduces a new and improved investment analysis method that is able to capture the complexity of investments with multivariable uncertainty and that facilitates decision-making. The results of this thesis provide a holistic picture of the Russian <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> mechanism on investment profitability.

We compare effects of <b>supporting</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energies</b> under both perfect and oligopolistic competition with competitive fringe firms and emission trading regimes that achieve 70 and 80 % emission reductions by 2050. The results indicate the importance of market power for <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> policy. Under imperfect competition welfare improvements is maximized by refunding 10 % of the emission trading proceeds, while under perfect competition the optimal refunding share is only 5 %. However, under both behavioral assumptions we find significant welfare improvements due to experience effects which are induced by the <b>support</b> for <b>renewable</b> <b>energy.</b> Emission trading <b>Renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> Experience effects Imperfect competition...|$|R

40|$|Given the intensifying debates whether {{governments should}} use {{industrial}} policies to promote particular <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> technologies, the main {{objective of this}} study is to investigate the long-run effects of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> policies on economic growth and employment in 15 European Union (EU) member states for the 1990 - 2012 time period by using panel-data time-series econometric techniques. The first hypothesis is that the EU’s <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> policies lead to technological advancement, followed by economy growth, in the long-run. The second hypothesis states that these policies at least generate an increase in output and employment in the short-run. In summary, our results provide some evidence in support of the second hypothesis, but, in contrary to the similar studies, our findings do not support the first hypothesis that these policies promote growth in the long-run. economic growth; EU; Granger causality; panel cointegration; policy; renewable energ...|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} {{composed}} as a diptych. First, a general framework of criteria {{to evaluate the}} performance of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> systems is elaborated. It is built around the main criteria effectiveness, efficiency and equity. All three are multi-layered and specifying {{the contents of the}} various layers is case dependent. Second, the framework is applied on detailed data about the Flemish tradable certificates support system. Several salient conclusions confirm observations from research in other countries causing growing awareness. First, most crucial is a careful and detailed qualification of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> sources and technologies. Without, even effectiveness is not reliably measurable. Second, nearby targets of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> output must follow from a clearly designed transition trajectory towards a sustainable electricity sector. Such transition is intertwined with an industrial technological policy for bringing the necessary technologies to development and maturity. Third, if the above two prerequisites are overridden certificates systems abound of excess profits, predominantly reaped by incumbent power companies being not the best agents of real change to a sustainable <b>energy</b> future. <b>Renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>support</b> systems Tradable certificates Excess profits...|$|R
