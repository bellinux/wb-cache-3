5|$|Since 1869, the Mount Washington Cog Railway has {{provided}} tourists with a train {{journey to the}} summit of Mount Washington. It uses a Marsh <b>rack</b> <b>system</b> {{and was the first}} successful rack railway in the US.|$|E
25|$|The {{funicular}} was {{of double}} track at standard gauge, using the Strub <b>rack</b> <b>system</b> for braking. The rails {{were supported by}} sleepers made of structural steel, supported on concrete pedestals.|$|E
25|$|The line {{uses the}} Abt <b>rack</b> <b>system</b> devised by Roman Abt, a Swiss {{locomotive}} engineer. The system comprises {{a length of}} toothed rail (the rack) between the running rails which meshes with a toothed wheel (the pinion) mounted on each rail vehicle's driving axle. The traditional logo for the railway is a pinion ring engaged on a rack bar. At the stations and passing loops, the real items are mounted on steel frames.|$|E
50|$|Selective {{pallet racking}} {{is a common}} pallet <b>racking</b> <b>system</b> in use today. Selective pallet <b>racking</b> <b>systems</b> {{typically}} come {{in one of two}} configurations: a roll formed, or clip-in configuration, and a structural bolt-together configuration.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} <b>rack</b> <b>systems</b> have been developed. With the exception of some early Morgan and Blenkinsop <b>rack</b> installations, <b>rack</b> <b>systems</b> place the <b>rack</b> rail halfway between the running rails. Today, most rack railways use the Abt system.|$|R
50|$|A remote <b>racking</b> <b>system</b> is {{a system}} that allows an {{operator}} to operate a <b>racking</b> <b>system</b> from a remote location. It offers a safe alternative to manually racking circuit breakers, which reduces the requirement for service personnel to wear a full-body arc flash hazard suit for protection.|$|R
25|$|The {{rack rail}} design used {{is one of}} Marsh's own inventions, using a ladder-like rack with open bar rungs engaged by {{the teeth of the}} cog wheel. This system allows snow and debris to fall through the rack rather than lodging in it. A similar design called the Riggenbach <b>rack</b> <b>system</b> was invented by {{engineer}} Niklaus Riggenbach in Switzerland at about the same time. The Swiss Consul to the United States visited Marsh while constructing the railway up Mount Washington, and his enthusiastic reports persuaded the Swiss government to commission Riggenbach to build the Vitznau-Rigi-Bahn on Rigi Mountain, which opened on May 21, 1871.|$|E
25|$|Baldwin {{also built}} six engines for the Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway, {{three of which}} were {{delivered}} in 1890, with the fourth being delivered in 1897. These engines featured steeply inclined boilers and used the Abt <b>rack</b> <b>system</b> to propel them up the average 16 percent grade. The last Baldwin engine {{was taken out of}} regular service in 1955. During the following years the engines were used as back-up engines and for snow removal. Three of the engines are currently on static display around Colorado. One (No. 1) is located at the Colorado Railroad Museum in Golden, Colorado. The other two on display are located in Manitou Springs, Colorado: one (No. 2) near city hall and the other (No. 5) at the Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway depot. The engine No. 4 is still in limited operation for photo opportunities and special events. However, it no longer completes the journey to the top of Pike's Peak {{due to the fact that}} many of the water tanks along the line have been removed. Engines No. 3 and No. 6 were scrapped and used for parts over the years.|$|E
500|$|The Nilgiri Mountain Railway is a [...] long metre gauge, {{single-line}} railroad which {{connects the}} town of Mettupalayam with the hill station of Udagamandalam (Ootacamund). The route is located within the state of Tamil Nadu and travels through the Nilgiri Hills, which are popularly known as the Blue Mountains of Southern India. The Nilgiri is the only rack railway in India and it uses an Abt <b>rack</b> <b>system.</b> The ABT system requires use of special steam locomotives. The line contains 208 curves, 16 tunnels, and 250 bridges causing the uphill journey along the route to take about 290 minutes (4.8 hours), while the downhill journey takes 215 minutes (3.6 hours).|$|E

50|$|Genesee Scientific {{has been}} awarded three patents by the United States Patent and Trademark Office for its revolutionary Drosophila vial <b>racking</b> <b>system</b> (patent numbers D673,296 S; 8,136,679 B2; and 8,430,251 B2). This Drosophila vial <b>racking</b> <b>system</b> {{significantly}} decreases time spent racking vials and is more environmentally friendly compared to traditional vial packaging configurations.|$|R
2500|$|The Mount Washington Cog Railway is the world's first mountain-{{climbing}} {{cog railway}} (rack-and-pinion railway). [...] The railway {{is still in}} operation, climbing Mount Washington in New Hampshire, USA.

[...] Its track is built to [...] gauge, which is technically a narrow gauge, as it is a -inch (12.7mm) less than [...]|$|E
2500|$|When the {{contract}} expired, the Mayor of Paris and the Seine Department charged the [...] (STCRP) with running {{the service and}} modernising the infrastructure. The <b>rack</b> <b>system</b> was deemed too dangerous and so the initial system was shut down; operations ceased on 1 November 1931. The water-driven system was replaced by two electrically driven cabins and reopened on 2 February 1935 after an interruption of more than three years. Traction was provided by a winch driven by a [...] electric motor, allowing a cabin holding fifty people to make the journey in 70 seconds at a speed of [...] The cabins were no longer arranged like a staircase but composed of a single compartment with a horizontal floor.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} losses from theft, the next innovation adopted by bike sharing programmes {{was the use of}} so-called 'smart technology'. One of the first 'smart bike' programmes was the Grippa™ bike storage <b>rack</b> <b>system</b> used in Portsmouth's Bikeabout scheme. The Bikeabout scheme was launched in October 1995 by the University of Portsmouth, UK as part of its Green Transport Plan in an effort to cut car travel by staff and students between campus sites. Funded in part by the EU's ENTRANCE programme, the Bikeabout scheme was a [...] "smart card" [...] fully automated system. For a small fee, users were issued 'smart cards' with magnetic stripes to be swiped through an electronic card reader at a covered 'bike store' kiosk, unlocking the bike from its storage rack. CCTV camera surveillance was installed at all bike stations in an effort to limit vandalism. Upon arriving at the destination station, the smart card was used to open a cycle rack and record the bike's safe return. A charge was automatically registered on the user's card if the bike was returned with damage or if the time exceeded the three-hour maximum. Implemented with an original budget of approximately £200,000, the Portsmouth Bikeabout scheme was never very successful in terms of rider usage, in part due to the limited number of bike kiosks and hours of operation. Seasonal weather restrictions and concerns over unjustified charges for bike damage also imposed barriers to usage. The Bikeabout program was discontinued by the University in 1998 in favour of expanded minibus service; the total costs of the Bikeabout programme were never disclosed.|$|E

50|$|Some {{disadvantages}} of high density pallet storage systems are; less {{access to all}} stock {{at any given moment}} (although if the stored product is all the same, it should not matter), and the expense of such <b>systems.</b> Selective pallet <b>rack</b> <b>systems</b> are considerably less expensive per pallet position than their higher density counterparts.
