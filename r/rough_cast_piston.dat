50|$|In {{the forging}} process, the <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> {{is placed in}} a die set while it is still hot and semi-solid. A {{hydraulic}} press is used to place the rough slug under tremendous pressure. This removes any possible porosity, and also pushes the alloy grains together tighter than {{can be achieved by}} simple casting alone. The end result is a much stronger material. Hypereutectic pistons can be forged, but typically are only cast, because the extra expense of forging is not justified when <b>cast</b> <b>pistons</b> are considered strong enough for stock applications.|$|R

50|$|The flask is {{then put}} back together, and metal can be {{poured into the}} mold. The metal will flow down the sprue, into the mold cavity, and back up the riser (of which there may be several). Once the metal has cooled enough to solidify, the flask can then be {{separated}} again, and the sand removed to reveal the <b>rough</b> <b>casting.</b> The <b>rough</b> <b>casting</b> is separated from the sprue and riser(s) either by sawing them off, or just breaking the thin metal of the gates and runners.|$|R
50|$|The former Customs House is symmetrically arranged, {{and has a}} {{rectangular}} plan with a Dutch gabled, terracotta clad roof, punctuated centrally by a square planned projection with a separate Dutch gabled roof, giving external expression to the former long room over which it sits. This projection is lined on four sides with face brick surrounded oculi on <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> stuccoed panels, with brick quoining {{at the corners of}} the projection. Flanking this tower element, to the south east and to the north west are rectangular planned chimney stacks, rendered with <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> stucco.|$|R

50|$|The Alameda is a {{historic}} apartment building located at Indianapolis, Indiana. It was built about 1925, and is a three-story, <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> buff brick building. It has commercial storefronts on the first floor. It features distinctive spandrels with basketweave pattern brickwork.|$|R
40|$|The <b>casting</b> of {{motorcycle}} <b>piston</b> {{was carried}} out using metallic mould. The prepared piston sand core was positioned in the mould to provide casting with contours and cavities. The molten metal of required composition was poured into the metallic mould, allowed to solidify and take the desired shape of the cavity. Aluminium silicon piston scraps were used as the casting material. Melting of the aluminium piston scraps was achieved using local crucible furnace and finally pouring the molten metal into the metallic mould having the prepared piston sand core in place to obtain the piston. After fettling and cleaning, the casting {{was found to be}} good. The composition test revealed that the scrap piston was made from LM 29 aluminium alloy. The <b>cast</b> <b>piston</b> was machined and subjected to performance rating test in a Jincheng AX 100 motorcycle engine. The rating used was based on a scale from 1 to 10. The higher the rating, the better the evaluation of the piston in the specific area rated. Deposits are evaluated by appearance, ranging from 10 (clean - absence of deposits) to 0. 0 (maximum deposits). In spite of various production constraints the result of the performance test was good. The rating showed that the locally <b>cast</b> <b>piston</b> compared favourably with imported piston...|$|R
50|$|Tredgold House is {{a single}} storey red-brown face brick {{building}} of stretcher bond construction with large galvanised iron hipped roof.

40|$|The {{submitted}} historic preservation´s procedure {{offers an}} instruction {{for the production}} and application of earth <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> and topping coat for rammed-earth monolithic masonry. After getting necessary skills, the submitted description of the building procedure is very effective within the hand-made production. Both connected layers of plaster are identical as to their material; the only difference consists in the ratio of admixtures added to the basic raw material. While making replicas of the buildings construction using the rammed-earth technique, the below-described procedure seems to be effective. The <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> (commonly called as špric) is a connecting bridge between the masonry and the plaster. The rough earth plaster is to plane possible masonry unevenness that developed during the construction, {{and to make a}} ground for the fine final plaster...|$|R

50|$|In {{his choice}} of materials, Fournier {{demonstrated}} concern for a smooth transition {{between the house and}} its setting. This concern for landscape was shared by both Prairie and Craftsman designers. The strong fieldstone foundation and <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> stucco are more in keeping with the Craftsman School. However Fournier included sidewalks of smooth, rose-colored concrete—a trait of the Prairie School.|$|R
50|$|The {{south-western}} {{elevation of}} the church, facing the driveway, has changed little from that designed by Gailey: 6 bays framed with shallow engaged piers connected top and bottom, the first 5 punctuated by tall, narrow windows with round-arches and sills, and that at the rear featuring both a narrow window, shorter than the others because of the sloping land, and a timber door with semicircular fanlight. The bays are <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> render while the frame is smooth render. The windows are filled with 4 coloured lead lights, 3 of which pivot along the horizontal centre line. The rear elevation is again Gailey's design, rendered in a similar pattern with a <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> face framed by smooth-rendered, engaged piers at each corner curving to the top plate connecting them under the gable end. A small, narrow window with round-headed arch and fixed louvres opens high into the centre of this wall.|$|R
5000|$|The {{supercharged}} 6.2L LSA {{is similar}} to the LS9 and debuted in the 2009 CTS-V. The LSA has been SAE certified at [...] at 6100 rpm and 551 lbft Nm at 3800 rpm. GM labeled it [...] "the most powerful ever offered in Cadillac’s nearly 106-year history". The LSA features a smaller 1.9L capacity supercharger rather than the 2.3 L variant of the LS9. Other differences include a slightly lower 9.0:1 compression ratio, single unit heat exchanger and <b>cast</b> <b>pistons.</b>|$|R
25|$|Around {{the same}} time the first window panes are thought to have been produced. The {{earliest}} panes were <b>rough</b> <b>cast</b> into a wooden frame on top of a layer of sand or stone, but from the late 3rd century onwards window glass was made by the muff process, where a blown cylinder was cut laterally and flattened out to produce a sheet.|$|R

50|$|Bronze {{items are}} {{typically}} cast, not forged. Secondary operations involve removing {{material from the}} <b>rough</b> <b>casting,</b> polishing, {{and the application of}} decorative elements. Some Chinese swords used high-tin bronze for the edges, since it is harder, and keeps a sharp edge longer, but is more brittle than the softer, lower-tin alloy used for the blade's core. Bronze alloys with lower tin content are tougher, or more resistant to fracturing.|$|R
