40|$|AbstractHit {{and target}} theory is widely {{known as a}} method for {{deriving}} the survival probability of a cell {{from the number of}} deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand breaks. Direct <b>action</b> and <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> are the way of causing DNA lesion by radiation. The object of a hit and target model is dried DNA. Strictly speaking, the model does not represent the generating mechanism of lesion in vivo. The biological effect by the direct action is major affection in a high dose region. However, the influence by the <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> is major affection in a low-dose region. Topics of modern interest concerning radiation damage are becoming the affection in the low-dose region. In this paper, we propose enhancing hit and target models which take the <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> into consideration...|$|R

40|$|Norwegian Special Operations Forces are {{traditionally}} divided {{according to their}} service affiliation, i. e. to the Army or Navy respectively. Transforming these forces {{to be prepared for}} current and emerging threats has mainly been an issue of organizational redesign, arguably for the benefit of reduced costs, rather than an issue of future roles and missions. This article offers an alternative perspective on transformation in which organizational design is viewed {{as a function of the}} way Special Operations Forces generally conduct missions. Special operations missions and tasks can broadly be categorised into direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> capabilities. Direct action capabilities are those that bring force directly into contact with the enemy. According to national and NATO doctrine, these are special reconnaissance and direct action missions and tasks. <b>Indirect</b> <b>action</b> capabilities are those that bring force to the enemy indirectly through a surrogate force, whether this is a guerrilla/insurgent force or a security force, a task doctrinally referred to as military assistance. With respect to the future transformation of Norwegian Special Operations Forces, this article claims that the current organizational structure, i. e., maintaining two separate units, should be maintained if <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> capabilities are to be emphasized and developed as a primary capability, which is not the case today. If special operations capabilities continue to focus on direct action capabilities, current organizational design is not necessarily optimal, and a merger option is therefore relevant...|$|R

The {{article describes}} an example of heater unit design layout for heating downcast shaft in mine «Scheglovskaya-Glubokaya» at colliery group «Donbass» using mixed type heat generators.

40|$|Abstract: A {{large number}} of {{xenobiotics}} (i. e. chemicals, drugs and biologicals) may adversely affect the immune system in consequence of different mechanisms: 1) the capacity of a large variety of xenobiotics to cause an allergic sensitization and different types of allergic sequelae (e. g. bronchial asthma, rhinitis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, contact dermatitis); 2) the adjuvant effect, potentiating the IgE mediated immuno-response against ubiquitous allergens (e. g. pollens); 3) the direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> on the immune system, at doses that did not cause overt toxicity. This effect is studied by a new discipline, called Immunotoxicology; 4) the <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> on the target organ, which facilitate the onset of respiratory symptoms in previously asymptomatic subjects.

40|$|Anaerobic {{microbial}} {{dissolution of}} several crystalline, water-insoluble forms of metal oxides {{commonly associated with}} the waste from energy production was investigated. An anaerobic N-fixing Clostridium sp. with an acetic, butyric, and lactic acid fermentation pattern, isolated from coal-cleaning waste, solubilized Fe 2 O 3 and MnO 2 by direct enzymatic reduction; CdO, CuO, PbO, and ZnO were solubilized by <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> due {{to the production of}} metabolites and the lowering of the pH of the growth medium. Extracellular heat-labile components of the cell-free spent medium obtained from cultures without oxide solubilized a significant amount of Fe 2 O 3 (1. 7 μmol); however, direct contact with the bacterial cells resulted in the complete dissolution (4. 8 μmol) of the oxide. Under identical conditions, the cell-free spent medium solubilized only a small amount of MnO 2 (0. 07 μmol), whereas 2. 3 μmol of the oxide was solubilized by direct bacterial contact. Reduction of Fe 2 O 3 and MnO 2 by Clostridium sp. proceeds at different rates and, possibly, by different enzymatic systems. Fe(III) and Mn(IV) oxides appear to be used as sinks for excess electrons generated from glucose fermentation, since there is no apparent increase in growth of the bacterium concomitant with the reduction of the oxides. Dialysis bag experiments with Co 2 O 3 indicate that there is a slight dissolution of Co (0. 16 μmol) followed by precipitation or biosorption. Although Mn 2 O 3, Ni 2 O 3, and PbO 2 may undergo reductive dissolution from a higher to a lower oxidation state, dissolution by direct or <b>indirect</b> <b>action</b> was not observed.
