500|$|According to Posner, [...] "Cardozo's 'bottom line' is {{that there}} is no {{liability}} to an unforeseeable plaintiff". Don Herzog, in his 2017 book, deemed the Palsgraf principle to mean that [...] "if anyone was wronged here, it was the man with the parcel. The guards' wronging him happened to harm Mrs. Palsgraf. But that doesn't mean they wronged Mrs. Palsgraf. And if they didn't wrong her, she can't conceivably prevail in a tort action. Cardozo is not thinking that if he were on the jury, he wouldn't find the railroad liable. He is saying it was a legal error to let the jury finding stand." [...] This is because [...] "the crucial fact for Cardozo is that the parcel of explosives was unmarked. So reasonably careful conductors worry only that if they make it fall, it will break...

Despite being driven almost entirely by dialogue, it's never once boring, and the only real issue is the question on everyone's minds: Where is Iron Man?" [...] Jesse Schedeen of IGN gave it an 8.3 out of 10 saying, [...] "Between the lackluster FCBD Special and Marvel's general track record with major crossovers, there's plenty of <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about Civil War II. But {{the good news is that}} this prologue issue makes a strong case for the upcoming event. It clearly lays out the brewing conflict and makes a strong case for both viewpoints." [...] David Pepose of Newsarama gave it an 8 out of 10 and said, [...] "Minor flaws in the premise aside, Bendis and Coipel deliver some surprisingly charming work with Civil War II #0, which — at least thus far — doesn't feel like the shameless cash-in that you might expect from this summer event sequel." ...|$|E

It tackles and discusses the following questions: (a) What does the term 'ladette' mean to pupils and teachers? (b) Do school-aged 'ladettes' 'exist' - and if so, what are they like inside and outside of school? (c) In what ways are 'ladettes' similar to, and different from, 'lads'? (d) Are teachers concerned about 'ladettes'? (e) Are 'ladette' behaviours on the increase...|$|R
