50|$|Japan Tobacco is the {{successor}} entity to a nationalized tobacco monopoly first {{established by the}} Government of Japan in 1898 to secure tax revenue collections from tobacco leaf sales. In 1904, the government's leaf monopoly was extended to a complete takeover of all tobacco business operations in the nation, including all <b>manufactured</b> <b>tobacco</b> products such as cigarettes. The ostensible reason {{for the expansion of}} control was to help fund the 1904 - 1905 Russo-Japanese War, but because all foreign tobacco interests in Japan at the time were forcibly evicted under the monopolization scheme, this also protected the domestic tobacco business for over eighty years.|$|R

40|$|Tobacco {{causes a}} wide {{spectrum}} of diseases. Its use is the world′s leading cause of death accounting for four million deaths per year. There is a general concept among the younger generation that chewing tobacco (spit tobacco, smokeless tobacco) is safe or less harmful than smoking, which has led to an increase in tobacco chewing habit. Chewable tobacco is a greater health hazard having 24 - 30 % higher tobacco content. In addition to oral cancer chewing tobacco leads to impaired functions of heart, nerves, brain and altered hormonal activities. Users of <b>manufactured</b> <b>tobacco</b> products like gutkha, pan parag etc. also present with an increasing incidence of oral submucous fibrosis; of concern is that this is of early onset. In this context patients coming to the OP clinic of Oral Medicine and Radiology, Dental College, Trivandrum were screened for OSF during the period Jan 2003 - Oct 2003. The clinical presentation of OSF in patients using these <b>manufactured</b> smokeless <b>tobacco</b> products or Betel quid spices was documented and were compared with the results of a similar study conducted in the department during the period May 1993 to Feb 1994...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an historical {{account of the}} consumption of <b>manufactured</b> <b>tobacco</b> in post-Unification Italy. The main phases of the monopoly are first reviewed. National and regional time series estimates for the years from 1871 to 1913 are then presented. At the national level, the new figures document a long-term reduction in per-capita consumption and a long-term increase in real per-capita spending. Per-capita real spending on tobacco followed rather closely the familiar Kuznets cycle with upper turning points in the mid- 1870 s, 1887, and, at an unprecedented level, in the pre-WWI years. The new estimates provide additional support to the «optimistic view» of the much debated «crisis» of the 1880 s. The longitudinal features of the new regional estimates are also exploited. A standard myopic model of tobacco consumption is considered and tentative estimates of both short and long run income and price elasticities are provided. The paper ends by presenting possible directions for future research...|$|R

60|$|We {{have been}} {{as far south as}} Richmond in Virginia (where they grow and <b>manufacture</b> <b>tobacco,</b> and where the labour is all {{performed}} by slaves), but the season in those latitudes is so intensely and prematurely hot, that it was considered a matter of doubtful expediency to go on to Charleston. For this unexpected reason, and because the country between Richmond and Charleston is but a desolate swamp the whole way, and because slavery is anything but a cheerful thing to live amidst, I have altered my route by the advice of Mr. Clay (the great political leader in this country), and have returned here previous to diving into the far West. We start for that part of the country--which includes mountain travelling, and lake travelling, and prairie travelling--the day after to-morrow, at eight o'clock in the morning; and shall be in the West, and from there going northward again, until the 30th of April or 1st of May, when we shall halt for a week at Niagara, before going further into Canada. We have taken our passage home (God bless the word) in the George Washington packet-ship from New York. She sails on the 7th of June.|$|R
40|$|It {{is renowned}} the {{importance}} of trade balance for maintaining macroeconomic equilibrium. So, {{the objective of the}} study was to identify main products in Brazilian agricultural exports from 1989 to 2012 and, secondly, to describe the identified products and formulate questions for future investigations. There is a trend for positive increasings in nominal level of agricultural exports. Substantive correlation between mean values and median values exported was also highlighted, something that can suggest the presence of products concentrating revenues. Moreover, increasing in mean values of agricultural exports was greater than increasing in mean values of global Brazilian exports, particularly from 2000. In terms of frequency in exported items, fruits and meat and edible meat offal must be cited. At second level in terms of frequency in export items there are animal and vegetable fats and oils, cocoa and cocoa preparations, preparations of vegetables and <b>tobacco</b> and <b>manufactured</b> <b>tobacco.</b> It is also remarkable specific codes of cocoa and cocoa preparations, sugars and sugar confectionery, and fruits, for example. Further studies can investigate potential increasing of consumption of those items in global markets and Brazilian perspectives in such scenario...|$|R
50|$|These taxes, {{collected}} by public administrations {{or by the}} institutions of the EU, apply to the production and the consumption of goods and of services. These taxes are independent from profits. They include taxes on the products and others taxes on the production. The taxes on the production cover essentially the taxe professionnelle, the taxe foncière and the versement transport (the professional tax, tax land and the payment transport), which apply to the use of labour and the property or the use of land, buildings and other assets used for the sake of production. They are local taxes, so they are not {{collected by}} the central government (see Local taxes). Taxes on consumption traditionally consisted of indirect duties on the consumption and excise duties, applying only on the use of certain products (alcoholic beverages, <b>manufactured,</b> <b>tobacco</b> products and energy products). However, the establishment of the VAT and its generalization have considerably reduced the scope and thus the revenue of these indirect duties and excise duties even if one of them, the tax on petroleum products, is still considerable. The revenue from the excise duties amounted in 2007 to €2.7 bn, without the TIPP.|$|R
