The transverse-face of each slice was scanned by an image scanner (GT-F 600, Epson) and printed out on a white paper. The internal-check outline was traced on the back of the printed paper, and its image was captured by the scanner. The number (NIC), total area (TAIC), and average area (AAIC) of the internal checks were obtained by the image processing program (ImageJ, NIH). The total length of the internal checks (TLIC) was measured using a ruler. The NIC, TAIC, and TLIC were calculated per square meter of green timber transverse area. Furthermore, to evaluate the <b>radial</b> <b>check</b> from the pith (heart checks), the total area of internal checks within a circle of 20  mm radius from the pith (TAICc) was obtained.|$|E

The total area of internal checks and the area of <b>radial</b> <b>checks</b> from the pith were larger for kumotooshi than yabukuguri, and {{were thought to be}} affected by the larger tangential shrinkage of kumotooshi. Tangential shrinkage {{is one of the most}} important factors affecting internal-checking variation, and the timber having larger tangential shrinkage is thought to form a larger area of internal checks.|$|R

30|$|The {{structure}} of a distribution network has great effects on economy, power supply reliability and investment of a power system. To obtain an optimal topology from possible topologies, we need to solve an optimisation problem which aims to find a radial structure satisfying operating constraints. As a basis of solving this optimisation problem, the encoding scheme, is to represent the candidate configurations {{by a series of}} codes. Numerical candidate topologies and unfeasible codes would lead low efficiency or premature convergence. This paper presents an effective scheme which can rapidly produce all radial configurations of a distribution network. In order to reduce the computational requirement of solution space, initial network is simplified as a topological graph which reserves loop branches and T-nodes. And a loop-branch chain incidence matrix is derived from analyzing the relationship between any two loops. Then the principles of selecting switches of each variable are designed to determine the ranges of the variables. All radial candidate solutions are available rapidly through applying the theory of combination. The scheme presented minimizes the number of solutions and avoids tedious <b>radial</b> <b>checking</b> procedure in view of avoiding any infeasible solutions. The validity of the proposed scheme is verified by illustrative examples.|$|R

Existence of radially symmetric solutions is proved by transforming the differential equations into integral ones, solvable {{by means of}} fixed point arguments.

In the pump tested, a volute with rectangular cross-section was used. The tests were carried out for several rotational speeds, including speeds above and below the nominal one. Commercial code ANSYS Fluent was used for the calculations. Apart from the predictions of the radial force, the calculations of axial thrust were also conducted, and correlation between thrust and the radial force was found.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{absorption}} {{cross section of the}} massive scalar field for the higher-dimensional extended object. Adopting the usual quantum mechanical matching conditions between the asymptotic and near-horizon solutions in <b>radial</b> equation, we <b>check</b> whether or not the universal property of the {{absorption cross section}}, which is that the low-energy cross section is proportional to the surface area of horizon, is maintained when the mass effect is involved. It is found that the mass effect in general does not break the universal property of the cross section if particular conditions are required to the spacetime geometry. However, the mass-dependence of the cross section is very sensitive to the spacetime property in the near-horizon regime.

40|$|The inner Galactic Bulge has, until recently, {{been avoided}} in {{chemical}} evolution studies due to extreme extinction and stellar crowding. Large, near-IR spectroscopic surveys, such as APOGEE, {{allow for the}} first time the measurement of metallicities in the inner region of our Galaxy. We study metallicities of 33 K/M giants situated in the Galactic Center region from observations obtained with the APOGEE survey. We selected K/M giants with reliable stellar parameters from the APOGEE/ASPCAP pipeline. Distances, interstellar extinction values, and <b>radial</b> velocities were <b>checked</b> to confirm that these stars are indeed situated in the inner Galactic Bulge. We find a metal-rich population centered at [M/H] = + 0. 4 dex, in agreement with earlier studies of other bulge regions, but also a peak at low metallicity around [M/H] = - 1. 0 dex, suggesting the presence of a metal-poor population which has not previously been detected in the central region. Our results indicate a dominant metal-rich population with a metal-poor component that is enhanced in the α-elements. This metal-poor population may be associated with the classical bulge and a fast formation scenario. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in Astronomy&Astrophysic...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Echoes in radar {{reflectivity}} data may correspond {{not just to}} precipitating particles, but may also be due to biological targets, anomalous propagation (AP) or ground clutter (GC). In earlier work, we described {{the development of an}} automated technique to quality control {{radar reflectivity}} data from WSR- 88 D so that the cleaned data may be used by severe weather and precipitation estimation algorithms. However, that work relied heavily on the use of velocity data that was nearly collocated in time with the reflectivity information. This is not the case for Canadian radar data. In this paper, we describe the development of a reflectivity-only classifier that is capable of identifying non-meteorological echoes in Canadian radar products. The classifier incorporates <b>radial</b> preprocessing, entropy <b>checks,</b> a neural network to combine texture and vertical features based on just reflectivity and a post-processing step that classifies regions instead of individual radar gates. There are, however, crucial differences between the automated classifier developed for WSR- 88 D and the one used for Canadian radar data. This paper describes the adaptations done to the classifier developed for WSR- 88 D S-band Doppler radars to enable it to work on C-band non-Doppler radars with a different scanning strategy.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveJuxta-anastomosis {{proximal}} {{radial artery}} ligation (PRAL) {{is a new}} surgical technique for reduction of excessive blood flow of radial cephalic fistulas (RCFs). Patients and methodsThis prospective study included 37 consecutive patients (eight children and 29 adults) who underwent PRAL of high-flow RCFs causing ischaemia (n =  2), aneurysmal degeneration of the vein (n =  14), and cardiac insufficiency (n =  7) or for prevention of cardiac overload (n =  14). Mean fistula age was 2. 6 years for children and 7. 4 years for adults. None had diabetes. Anatomical prerequisites (side-to-end anastomosis fistula and retrograde flow in the distal <b>radial</b> artery) were <b>checked</b> by ultrasound or angiography. Division and ligation of the juxta-anastomosis proximal radial artery were performed under regional anaesthesia. Patency following ligation was estimated according to the life table method. ResultsThe success rate was 92 % (34 / 37). The three failures included one excessive and two insufficient reductions of flow (< 33 %). Mean flow reduction rates were 50 % in children and 53 % in adults. Primary patency rates at 1 and 2 years were 88 % ±  6 % and 74 % ±  9 %, respectively. Secondary patency rates were 88 % ±  6 % and 78 % ±  8 %, respectively. ConclusionPRAL is a simple, safe, and effective technique for reduction of flow in RCFs...|$|R
40|$|Various {{spectral}} emission {{lines from}} star-forming molecular cloud core L 1517 B manifest red asymmetric double-peaked profiles with stronger red peaks and weaker blue peaks, {{in contrast to}} the oft-observed blue-skewed molecular spectral line profiles with blue peaks stronger than red peaks. Invoking a spherically symmetric general polytropic hydrodynamic shock model for the envelope expansion with core collapse (EECC) phase, we show the radial flow velocity, mass density and temperature structures of self-similar evolution for L 1517 B in a dynamically consistent manner. By prescribing simple radial profiles of abundance distribution for pertinent molecules, we perform molecular excitation and radiative transfer calculations using the publicly available RATRAN code set for the spherically symmetric case. Our computational results show that the EECC model reproduces molecular spectral line profiles in sensible agreement with observational data of IRAM, FCRAO and Effelsberg 100 m telescopes for L 1517 B. We also report spatially resolved observations of optically thick line HCO+(1 - 0) using the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) 13. 7 m telescope at Delingha in China and the relevant fitting results. Hyperfine line structures of NH 3 and N 2 H+ transitions are also fitted to consistently reveal the dynamics of central core collapse. As a consistent model <b>check,</b> <b>radial</b> profiles of 1. 2 mm and 0. 85 mm dust continua observed by IRAM 30 m telescope and SCUBA, respectively, are also fitted numerically using the same EECC model that produces the molecular line profiles. L 1517 B is likely undergoing an EECC shock phase. For future observational tests, we also predict several molecular line profiles with spatial distributions, radial profile of sub-millimeter continuum at wavelength 0. 45 mm, as well as the radial profiles of the column density and visual extinction for L 1517 B.

40|$|We present new lightcurves of {{the massive}} hot Jupiter system WASP- 18 {{obtained}} with the Spitzer spacecraft covering the entire orbit at 3. 6 micron and 4. 5 micron. These lightcurves are {{used to measure the}} amplitude, shape and phase of the thermal phase effect for WASP- 18 b. We find that our results for the thermal phase effect are limited to an accuracy of about 0. 01 % by systematic noise sources of unknown origin. At this level of accuracy we find that the thermal phase effect has a peak-to-peak amplitude approximately equal to the secondary eclipse depth, has a sinusoidal shape and that the maximum brightness occurs at the same phase as mid-occultation to within about 5 degrees at 3. 6 micron and to within about 10 degrees at 4. 5 micron. The shape and amplitude of the thermal phase curve imply very low levels of heat redistribution within the atmosphere of the planet. We also perform a separate analysis to determine the system geometry by fitting a lightcurve model to the data covering the occultation and the transit. The secondary eclipse depths we measure at 3. 6 micron and 4. 5 micron are in good agreement with previous measurements and imply a very low albedo for WASP- 18 b. The parameters of the system (masses, radii, etc.) derived from our analysis are in also good agreement with those from previous studies, but with improved precision. We use new high-resolution imaging and published limits on the rate of change of the mean <b>radial</b> velocity to <b>check</b> for the presence of any faint companion stars that may affect our results. We find that there is unlikely to be any significant contribution to the flux at Spitzer wavelengths from a stellar companion to WASP- 18. We find that there is no evidence for variations in the times of eclipse from a linear ephemeris greater than about 100 seconds over 3 years. Comment: 17 pages, 10 figures.

40|$|This work {{examines}} the fundamental flow behaviour of granular materials under conditions relevant to blast furnace. Such a study {{may have some}} impact {{on the development of}} new technology to improve performance of blast furnace operation. The blast furnace operation involves rich granular dynamics phenomena which currently attract a strong interest from wide scientific and engineering community. In this work, percolation phenomenon is analyzed extensively. Percolation phenomenon {{is one of the most}} significant factors which cause particle segregation and mixing. In blast furnace when sinter and coke of different size and density are charged, percolation phenomenon occurs. In this work percolation properties like percolation velocity, residence time distribution and <b>radial</b> dispersion are <b>checked</b> for different material properties of percolating particles. It was found that percolation behaviour is related to many factors. Percolation properties of a single particle and also for batches of percolating particle were examined. The effect of external forces on percolation properties is also checked. DEM simulation method was found to be suitable for analysis of percolation flow behaviour of different types of particles. It was also found that the change of packed bed conditions has a great impact on particle percolation and segregation behaviour. In a packed bed, vibration and liquid of different properties were introduced. Particle dynamics in descending packed bed condition was checked. The effect of vibration and descending velocity was measured for percolation behaviour. Both vibration frequency and amplitude are important factors for particle flow in such a packed bed. Descending velocity of packed particles combined with vibration was found to have a pronounced impact on percolation behaviour. Liquid properties like viscosity and density affect particle dynamics significantly. Particle segregation in a pile was investigated as an extension of the percolation study. The effects of diameter ratio of binary feed, initial mixing ratio, feed rate in case of central feeding on conical pile were investigated. It was found that all of those parameters affect particle flow and segregation. Flowing layer over static pile was simulated and velocity profile and mixing ratio in different layers were observed. 3 -D Screening Layer model was validated by DEM and experiment. In case of multipoint feed system, a conical pile which is similar to the deadman of a blast furnace was generated and the flowing layer characteristics over this static pile was also analysed...|$|R
