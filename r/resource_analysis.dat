50|$|In 1996, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) {{conducted}} a wind <b>resource</b> <b>analysis</b> and mapping study.

These areas include Bangui and Burgos towns in Ilocos Norte, Batanes and Babuyan Islands, which are north of Luzon and the higher interior terrain of Mindoro, Samar, Leyte, Panay, Negros, Cebu, Palawan and Eastern Mindanao. The study led to {{the inception of the}} wind farm project. NorthWind Power Development Corp. developed (and maintains and operates) the project, while Vestas Wind Systems, a Danish firm, supplied the wind turbine-generator units (WTGs) for the site, similar to those already found in Denmark.

50|$|The Human Resources Research Organization (HumRRO) is an applied {{research}} company founded by Meredith P.

The company was established in 1951 as the Human Resources Research Office of George Washington University to study human resources for the Department of the Army. In 1967, HumRRO's charter was modified to extend its services to other departments of the Federal Government, {{to state and local}} governments, and to private companies and foundations. In 1969, HumRRO severed its connection with George Washington University and became a non-profit research organization. During its first 24 years, HumRRO operated as a Federal Contract Research Center (FCRC). The company’s status as an FCRC was terminated at the end of 1975.|$|E
40|$|Predicting the {{resources}} that are consumed by a program component is crucial for many parallel or distributed systems. In this context, the main resources of interest are execution time, space and communication/synchronisation costs. There has recently been significant progress in <b>resource</b> <b>analysis</b> technology, notably in type-based analyses and abstract interpretation. At the same time, parallel and distributed computing are becoming increasingly important. This paper synthesises progress in both areas to survey the state-of-the-art in <b>resource</b> <b>analysis</b> for parallel and distributed computing. We articulate a general model of <b>resource</b> <b>analysis</b> and describe parallel/distributed <b>resource</b> <b>analysis</b> together with the relationship to sequential analysis.
