50|$|In October 2010, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) {{recalled}} 1998-2002 Rodeos, 2002 Isuzu Axioms, and 1998-2002 Honda Passports due to corrosion of the vehicle's {{frame in}} the vicinity of the rear suspension. Vehicles without corrosion in the affected area would be treated with an anti-corrosion compound. Vehicles with more severe corrosion would have a <b>reinforcement</b> <b>bracket</b> installed. In some cases, corrosion was so severe that repairs could not be made, resulting in Isuzu and Honda purchasing vehicles from the owners.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the areas}} was the {{attachment}} ring where the SRBs {{are connected to the}} external tank. Areas of distress were noted in some of the fasteners where the ring attaches to the SRB motor case. This situation was attributed to the high loads encountered during water impact. To correct the situation and ensure higher strength margins during ascent, the attach ring was redesigned to encircle the motor case completely (360 degrees). Previously, the attachment ring formed a 'C' shape and encircled the motor case just 270 degrees.Additionally, special structural tests were performed on the aft skirt. During this test program, an anomaly occurred in a critical weld between the hold-down post and skin of the skirt. A redesign was implemented to add <b>reinforcement</b> <b>brackets</b> and fittings in the aft ring of the skirt.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to {{increased interest in}} fuel economy, Dodge offered the [...] "Dart Lite" [...] fuel economy package which weighed at least 150 lb less than the ordinary Dart Sport. The 225 slant-six was the only available engine, equipped with an aluminum intake manifold {{for the first time}} since 1960 and a specially calibrated carburetor and distributor. Bumper <b>reinforcement</b> <b>brackets</b> were aluminum instead of steel, while the hood and trunk lid bracing and inner panels were also aluminum. The slant-six engine block had already been modified for reduced weight in 1975; in the middle of 1976 production its crankshaft was changed from forged steel to lighter cast iron. The high-flow exhaust system included a dual-biscuit catalytic converter, a 2Â¼" [...] headpipe, and the muffler used on V8 models. The Dart Lite was equipped with a 2.94:1 rear axle rather than the customary 3.21:1 ratio when the car was ordered with a three- or four-speed manual transmission. The A833OD overdrive 4-speed manual transmission housing was made of aluminum. Like all other Darts, the Dart Lites with automatic transmission came with a 2.76:1 rear axle as standard equipment. The Dart Lite with manual transmission was rated by the EPA at 36 mpg (6.5 l/100km) in highway driving. The Plymouth version was the Feather Duster.|$|R
