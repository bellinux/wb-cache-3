25|$|The macropods {{are divided}} into three families: the Hypsiprymnodontidae, with the musky rat-kangaroo as its only member; the Potoroidae, with 11 species; and the Macropodidae, with 45 species. Macropods are found in all Australian environments except alpine areas. The Potoroidae include the bettongs, potaroos and <b>rat-kangaroos,</b> small species that make nests and carry plant {{material}} with their tails. The Macropodiae include kangaroos, wallabies and associated species; size varies widely within this family. Most macropods have large hind legs and long, narrow hind feet, with a distinctive arrangement of four toes, and powerfully muscled tails, which they use to hop around. The musky rat-kangaroo is the smallest macropod and the only species that is quadrupedal not bipedal, while the male red kangaroo is the largest, reaching a height of about 2m and weighing up to 85kg.|$|E

5000|$|Gautieria is a genus of [...] {{fungi in}} the family Gomphaceae. They form mycorrhizae with various tree species, mostly from the Pinaceae family. Species are present {{over much of the}} world's {{temperate}} and boreal forest habitats.

Also, some Australian marsupials, especially the <b>rat-kangaroos,</b> feed extensively on these fungi. The fungi also benefit from this relationship: not only do the squirrels help to disperse the spores and propagate the species, studies suggest that passage through the digestive tract of a mammal promotes germination of spores.|$|E

50|$|The boodie (Bettongia lesueur), {{also known}} as the {{burrowing}} bettong, is a small marsupial.

40|$|Musky <b>rat-kangaroos</b> inhabit {{tropical}} rain forest and are Australia's smallest and most primitive member of the Macropodoidea. Their ecology and behaviour has remained unknown in the wild until this study, {{and is expected to}} be representative of an early unspecialised macropodoid lifestyle. I examined the diet of musky <b>rat-kangaroos</b> using a range of methods including microscopic examination of faecal pellets, direct observation, spool-and-line tracking and examinion of teeth marks left in fruit on the forest floor. Musky <b>rat-kangaroos</b> are frugivores and consumed the fruits of 40 species of plant on a 9 -ha rainforest site in Wooroonooran National Park, Queensland. They ate primarily the flesh of fruits, but 11 % of seeds from approximately half the species of fruit consumed were also eaten. While musky <b>rat-kangaroos</b> ate fruit from all size classes, they preferred large, fleshy drupes and seeds with a moderate to soft seed coat but without latex present. Invertebrates and the epigeal fruiting bodies of some agaric fungi were the other significant dietary components and these showed seasonal patterns of significance in the diet and differential use by adults and subadults. Musky <b>rat-kangaroos</b> eat the lowest-fibre diet of all animals in the superfamily Macropodoidea and their size and digestive tract reflect this unspecialised, and probably ancestral, diet...|$|E
40|$|Musky <b>Rat-kangaroos,</b> Hypsiprymnodon moschatus, are the {{smallest}} {{member of the}} kangaroo family (Macropodoidea) and are restricted to Australia's tropical rain forest in north-east Queensland, where they are important dispersal agents for rain forest plants. This study {{was the first to}} examine their basic ecology in the field and initially aimed to determine their diet, reproduction, population size and movement patterns. After beginning field-work, I discovered that Musky <b>Rat-kangaroos</b> were primarily frugivorous and scatterhoarded fruits and seeds. Subsequently, the aims of my study focussed on their role as dispersal agents and what effects their caching behaviour had on the survival of the seeds they disperse. The diet of Musky <b>Rat-kangaroos</b> was examined through direct observation, assessing teeth marks in fruit and by microscopic examination of faeces. They can be classified as frugivores on the basis that the fruits and seeds of at least 49 species accounted for the bulk of their diet throughout the year. However, they also consumed invertebrates and fungus which became more significant in their diet when fruit availability was low. Larger quantities of fungus were consumed during the Wet season (February to April) and invertebrates during the Cold season (May to July) than at other times of year. This shift in emphasis in their diet reflected the pattern of availability of ripe fruits. Ripe fruits were most abundant during the Dry and storm seasons (August to January), declined in the Wet season and reached their yearly minimum in the late Wet and early Cold season (April, May). Fruit biomass was at least 300 times higher during the peak than in the trough periods in the years examined, whereas invertebrate availability was stable in comparison. Musky <b>Rat-kangaroos</b> were common on my study site, averaging 2. 4 /ha. They occupied small home ranges (males - 2. 1 ha; females 1. 4 ha) which overlapped extensively with other individuals of both genders. They were solitary and promiscuous and their seasonal reproductive pattern reflected the changes in availability of ripe fruits. Males underwent rapid expansion of their testes during the peak in fruit availability (September) and remained reproductive until fruit availability declined in March or April. Females evicted pouch young during peak fruit availability (October) and gave birth to one, two or three young {{at the end of the}} peak fruiting season (February to April). Both male reproductive seasonality and multiple young per litter are exceptional characteristics among macropodoids and probably result from Musky Rat-kangaroo's unique niche as the only frugivorous macropodoid. Musky <b>Rat-kangaroos</b> dispersed the seeds of many of the fruits they consumed. They scatterhoarded 14...|$|E
40|$|Macropodoid {{marsupials}} {{have revealed}} strong sex-differential patterns, {{consistent with those}} found in other mammals (Johnson 1989; Greenwood 1980).

Females typically remain close to their birth place, often settling within the maternal home range, resulting in long-term association of female kin. Dispersal in potoroids (<b>rat-kangaroos)</b> is far less well understood.
