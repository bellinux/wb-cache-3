Additionally, temperature, relative humidity and ventilation rate were recorded continuously.  Emissions were calculated using a mass balance on each farm.  Results showed PM concentrations in <b>rabbit</b> <b>farms</b> are low compared with poultry and pig farms.  Average PM 10 concentrations were 0. 082 ± 0. 059 mg/m 3 (fattening rabbits), and 0. 048 ± 0. 058 mg/m 3 (reproductive does). Average PM 2. 5 concentrations were 0. 012 ± 0. 016 mg/m 3 (fattening rabbits), and 0. 012 ± 0. 035 mg/m 3 (reproductive does). Particulate matter concentrations were significantly influenced by the type of human farm activity carried out in the building rather than by animal activity.  The main PM-generating activity on the fattening <b>rabbit</b> <b>farm</b> was sweeping, and the major PM-generating activity in reproductive does was sweeping and burning hair from the cages.  Average PM 10 emissions were 5. 987 ± 6. 144 mg/place/day (fattening rabbits), and 14. 9 ± 31. 5 mg/place/day (reproductive does).  Average PM 2. 5 emissions were 0. 20 ± 1. 26 mg/place/day (fattening rabbits), and 2. 83 ± 19. 54 mg/place/day (reproductive does).  Emission results indicate that <b>rabbit</b> <b>farms</b> can be considered relevant point sources of PM emissions, comparable to other livestock species.  Our results improve the knowledge on factors affecting concentration and emissions of PM in <b>rabbit</b> <b>farms</b> and can contribute to the design of suitable PM reduction measures to control not only PM inside rabbit houses, but also its emission into the atmosphere. </p...|$|R

Twenty years of legal battling between the golfers and rabbit farmers ended in 1821 when a local landowner and golfer named James Cheape of Strathtyrum bought the land and is credited with saving the links for golf. The course evolved without the help of any one architect for many years, though notable contributions to its design were made by Daw Anderson in the 1850s and Old Tom Morris (1865-1908), who designed the 1st and 18th holes.

As interest in the game increased, groups of golfers would often be playing the same hole, but going in different directions.|$|E

40|$|Livestock {{houses are}} {{major sources of}} {{airborne}} particulate matter (PM), which can originate from manure, feed, feathers, skin and bedding and may contain and transport microorganisms. Improved knowledge of particle size, morphology, chemical and microbiological composition of PM in livestock houses can help identify major sources of PM {{and contribute to the}} development of appropriate source-specific reduction techniques. In rabbit production systems, however, there is limited information on specific particle characteristics. The objective of this study was to characterise airborne PM in <b>rabbit</b> <b>farms</b> in terms of morphology, chemical compositions and bacterial concentration in different size fractions. Size-fractioned PM was sampled in the air of 2 <b>rabbit</b> <b>farms,</b> 1 for fattening rabbits and 1 for reproductive does, using a virtual cascade impactor, which simultaneously collected total suspended PM (TSP), PM 10 and PM 2. 5 size fractions. Airborne PM samples were examined by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Representative samples from potential sources of PM were also collected and examined. Additionally, a methodology to extract bacteria from the collected samples of airborne PM was developed to determine the bacterial concentration per PM size fraction. Results showed that airborne PM in <b>rabbit</b> <b>farms</b> is highly complex in particle morphology, especially in size. Broken skin flakes, disintegrated particles from feed or faecal material from mechanical fracture are the main sources of airborne PM in <b>rabbit</b> <b>farms.</b> Major elements found in rabbit airborne PM were S, Ca, Mg, Na and Cl. Bacterial concentrations ranged from 1. 7 × 10 4 to 1. 6 × 10 6 colony forming units (CFU) /m 3 (TSP); from 3. 6 × 10 3 to 3. 0 × 10 4 CFU/m 3 (PM 10); and from 3. 1 × 10 3 to 1. 6 × 10 4 CFU/m 3 (PM 2. 5).

50|$|Bravery and hardwork of Bikpakpaam:The {{core values}} of Bikpakpaam include: bravery, hard work, determination, generosity, hospitality, courage, and collectivism, love {{of family life}} and support for family members. This hard working {{attribute}} evolved {{as a component of}} their culture which requires every adolescent to work hard enough to plow their own farm land and that of their parents in the same season in order to become economically independent and raise their own families. In their hay days, typical Bikpakpaam farmers will plow their own yam farm manually, boasting of 15,000-20,000 yam mounds yearly. This is evident in the fact that Bikpakpaam are the major yam producers in Ghana and Togo. In Ghana, Bikpakpaam are proud to feed the nation and even export yam through the Konkomba Yam Market in Agbogbloshie, Accra. In addition to yam farming, Bikpakpaam farmers also boast of maize, guinea corn, and millet and rice farms. Bikpakpaam women care for the men as they plow the fields, but also plow their own fields where they grow mainly vegetables and legumes (groundnuts, and beans). Women also gather fruits for economic gain namely shea nuts (used to make shea butter) and dawadawa fruits, which have a diversified use. Bikpakpaam women are also excellent in harvest and post harvest processing and marketing of foodstuff. Gathering of firewood and charcoal production for both domestic and commercial use are integral part of Bikpakpaam women duties. The brewing of a local drink known as ndamam (“red drink”) popularly known as pito is a natural gift and preserve of women.Animal rearing is also practiced by Bikpakpaam for domestic consumption and commercial purposes. Such animals include birds (fowls, guinea fowls, ducks, and doves), ruminants (mainly goats, sheep, and cattle) and pigs. In recent times, some farmers have delved into guinea pig, grasscutter and <b>rabbit</b> <b>farming</b> for commercial purposes. Bikpakpaam farmers also now boast of large plantations of fruit trees, mainly mango and cashew trees. The practice of collective solidarity in the form of communal labor termed as nkpawiin depicts hardwork, unity and collaboration among Bikpakpaam communities. Here, individuals seek help from the entire community to meet labour needs (farming, construction and other forms of work) and this occurs in turns. Bikpakpaam are swift, brave and security conscious.|$|E

In this study questionnaire and examination sheets were used to record the information.
