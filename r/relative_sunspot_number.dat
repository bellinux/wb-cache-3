40|$|The {{pattern of}} the eleven-year {{variation}} of the <b>relative</b> <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers,</b> i. e., the Wolf numbers, is much {{different from that of}} the solar flares associated with the emissions of solar cosmic rays, type IV and great microwave impulsive radio bursts. Roughly speaking, the maximum phase of the latter is later by about three years from that of the former. It seems that such a time delay has been brought by the use of the <b>relative</b> <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> as the index of solar activity. Taking into account that the occurrence frequency of solar flares is approximately proportional to the <b>relative</b> <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers,</b> the degree of solar activity related to the active phenomena on the sun is inferred to be closely connected with some of the nature of sunspots and their groups. It is clear, furthermore, that the {{pattern of the}} eleven-year variation of the coronal brightness with respect to the 5303 A green line emission is very similar to that of the occurrence frequency of solar cosmic-ray flares. This fact suggests that the occurrence of solar cosmic-ray flares is connected with the coronal active regions. Some critical discussion is given on the indices of solar activity from the view points that the coronal activity is intimately connected with the active phenomena over the sun's photosphere. It is shown that the <b>relative</b> <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> in each of the northern and southern hemispheres must be defined as the representative index of solar activity, whenever the <b>relative</b> <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> are adopted...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new spectral {{approach to the}} study of the periodic variation of <b>relative</b> <b>sunspot</b> cycles and the extent of the randomness in the amplitudes and phases of the harmonic components of the fundamental frequency of the cycles. The new method is called the signal coherence spectrum of a time series that has a randomly modulated periodicity. The data we use is the <b>relative</b> <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> beginning December 21, 1838 until June 30, 2008 as compiled by the Solar Influences Data Analysis Center (SIDC) at the Royal Observatory of Belgium using the FORTRAN 95 program developed by Hinich (2000). Deterministic sinusoids are often used to model cycles as a mathematical convenience. However, it is time to break away from this simplification in order to model the various periodic signals that are observed in fields ranging from biology, communications, acoustics, astronomy, and the various sciences. We detect a strong coherence at 3966 days (10. 86 years) which is consistent with the reported 11 -year sunspot cycle. Additionally, we find strongly coherent harmonics at about 20 days (0. 8 coherence), 2. 75 days (0. 87 coherence), and 2. 1 days (0. 83 coherence).

40|$|The Sun shows {{a global}} {{magnetic}} field cycle traditionally best {{visible in the}} photosphere as a changing sunspot cycle featuring roughly an 11 year period. In addition we know that our host star also harbours small-scale magnetic fields often seen as strong concentrations of magnetic flux reaching kG field strengths. These features are situated in inter-granular lanes where they show up bright as so-called magnetic bright points (MBPs). In this short paper we wish to analyse a homogenous nearly 10 year long synoptic Hinode image data set recorded from November 2006 up to February 2016 in the G-band to inspect {{the relationship between the}} number of MBPs at the solar disc centre and the <b>relative</b> <b>sunspot</b> <b>number.</b> Our findings suggest that indeed the number of MBPs at the solar disc centre is correlated to the <b>relative</b> <b>sunspot</b> <b>number,</b> but with the particular feature of showing two different temporal shifts between the decreasing phase of cycle 23 including the minimum and the increasing phase of cycle 24 including the maximum. While the former is shifted by about 22 months the later is only shifted by less than 12 months. Moreover, we introduce and discuss an analytical model to predict the number of MBPs at the solar disc centre purely depending on the evolution of the <b>relative</b> <b>sunspot</b> <b>number</b> as well as the temporal change of the <b>relative</b> <b>sunspot</b> <b>number</b> and two background parameters describing a possibly acting surface dynamo as well as the strength of the magnetic field diffusion. Finally, we are able to confirm the plausibility of the temporal shifts by a simplistic random walk model. The main conclusion to be drawn from this work is that the injection of magnetic flux, coming from active regions as represented by sunspots, happens on faster time scales than the removal of small-scale magnetic flux elements later on.

The correction factor Kb for the entire observing period is 0. 9519, which is calculated using the linear least square method {{to the relationship between}} the daily sunspot number, RB, and the daily international <b>relative</b> <b>sunspot</b> <b>number,</b> Ri. The yearly correction factor calculated for each year varies slightly from year to year and shows a trend to change along the solar cycle.

For this, a weighted mean and weighted standard deviation of monthly sunspot number are used to estimate the error from observed data. We find that the observed error (noise) is much smaller than that used in the simulation. Thus no distinct k-variation with the solar cycle is observed contrary to the simulation. In addition, the probability distribution of k is determined to be non-Gaussian with a fat-tail on the right side.

The C reservoir model deconvolves histories {{for each of these}} three processes that are compatible with a 96 -yr bi-decadal atmospheric (tree-ring) ΔC record assuming alternative pre-Holocene C conditions. Holocene microparticle concentrations in ice cores and dust grain sizes in marine sediment cores disagree with the model-derived global wind speeds necessary to explain (through F variations) the millennium-scale trends in atmospheric ΔC. Alternately, foram C data do not support the history in the oceanic ventilation index generated by millennium-scale K z variations. Coral C data for recent centuries conflict with the marine ΔC history associated with century-scale variations in F or K z but are consistent with changes in C production rate. The C production rates derived theoretically from an 11, 000 -yr record of averaged global dipole moments strongly correlate with the Q history required to explain tree-ring ΔC. Several pre-Holocene Q histories were calculated from limited dipole moment data available for the past 30, 000 yrs and do not contradict 234 U/ 230 Th-calibrated coral C measurements. Relative variations in Greenland ice-core Be concentrations (reflecting changes in Be production) over the past 9000 yrs also correlate strongly with tree-ring Q fluctuations except for a 4500 - 3500 BC discrepancy. Simulations of transient variations in Q, F, and K z supplement previous studies of alternative steady-state C situations. The modeling of combined climate and production rate scenarios (i. e. F + K z, F + Q, K z + Q) incorporates "feedback" effects which depend on the instantaneous marine C profile and atmosphere/surface ocean C disparity. Spectral analyses of the 9600 -yr tree-ring Q history generally produce power at or near harmonics of a 420 -yr cycle. Century-scale Q periodicities may reflect harmonic or nonsinusoidal solar processes. Residual 14 C production and bi-decadal <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> from AD 1700 to 1840 define a preliminary history of <b>relative</b> <b>sunspot</b> <b>numbers</b> back to 7730 BC. "Fine-tuned" Q periodicities are used to forecast future solar behavior...|$|R

A method is proposed which allows the contribution of active-region faculae and sunspots to irradiance changes to be isolated even when only a single proxy of solar activity, such as <b>sunspot</b> <b>relative</b> <b>number,</b> RZ, is available. The resulting reconstruction explicitly takes the non-linear relationship between RZ and irradiance variations into account. Nev-ertheless, due to the decreasing accuracy of the solar proxy data {{the accuracy of the}} reconstruction decreases at earlier epochs. The main uncertainty, however, lies in the recon-struction of the quiet-sun irradiance variations...|$|R
