5|$|In 1337 Flemish weavers {{settled and}} {{introduced}} {{the manufacture of}} woollen cloth. More Flemish weavers, fleeing the Huguenot persecutions, settled here in the 17th century. The second wave of settlers wove fustian, a <b>rough</b> <b>cloth</b> made of linen and cotton. Digging sea coal was recorded in 1374. There was an outbreak of the plague in the town in 1623.|$|E
2500|$|Puebla built a {{significant}} manufacturing sector, mainly in textile production in workshops (obrajes), supplying New Spain and markets {{as far away}} as Guatemala and Peru. Transatlantic ties between a particular Spanish town, Brihuega, and Puebla demonstrate the close connection between the two settlements. The take-off for Puebla's manufacturing sector did not simply coincide with immigration from Brihuega, but was crucial to [...] "shaping and driving Puebla's economic development, especially in the manufacturing sector." [...] Brihuega immigrants not only came to Mexico with expertise in textile production, but the transplanted briocenses provided capital to create large-scale obrajes. Although obrajes in Brihuega were small-scale enterprises, quite a number of them in Puebla employed up to 100 workers. Supplies of wool, water for fulling mills, and labor (free indigenous, incarcerated Indians, black slaves) were available. Although much of Puebla's textile output was <b>rough</b> <b>cloth,</b> it also produced higher quality dyed cloth with cochineal from Oaxaca and indigo from Guatemala. But by the eighteenth century, Querétaro had displaced Puebla as the mainstay of woolen textile production.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, master, I can doubtless {{get some}} <b>rough</b> <b>cloth</b> of the colour, at Jedburgh; and indeed, {{there is a}} small monastery about three miles hence on the road, and it may be that, if Adam Armstrong will go with us and say {{wherefore}} it is wanted, the prior will let him have one." ...|$|E
60|$|They were nearing {{a narrow}} road, two ruts worn into the sand. A Martian hufa was pulling the cart, its great sides wet with perspiration, its tongue hanging out. The cart was {{piled high with}} bales of <b>cloth,</b> <b>rough</b> country <b>cloth,</b> hand dipped. A bent farmer urged the hufa on.|$|R
40|$|Flax is {{the oldest}} plant fiber used by man. Its moisture-absorbent qualities and ability to conduct heat make linen a cool cloth for wear in hot climates. Fine linen fabrics became soft, {{beautiful}} and lustrous with use. Tow, the short fibers, was used to produce <b>rougher</b> <b>cloth.</b> Through the centuries workers have processed the plant {{in much the same}} manner. It was a labor-intensive and highly-skilled process not suited to mechanization. By the time of European settlement, it’s manufacture and trade were well established in Europe; settlers to the New World brought the knowledge and skills with them...|$|R
60|$|The {{clothing}} of the unfreemen was finer {{than that}} of the thralls. The legs and arms of nearly all were bare from the knees and elbows downward, though a few had swathed their limbs in bands of <b>rough</b> woollen <b>cloth,</b> while others used straw for this purpose. Nearly all the men wore shoes of untanned leather, and caps of the same material, or of <b>rough</b> homespun <b>cloth,</b> resembling in form the cap of modern fishermen. The udallers, such as Haldor, Ulf, and their children, were clad in finer garments, which were looped and buttoned with brooches and pendants of gold and silver, the booty gathered on those viking cruises, against which Hilda inveighed so earnestly.|$|R
60|$|First he lashed {{the short}} pieces across {{the ends of}} the two bamboos, so as to keep them a foot apart; then he put ratlines across, and soon had the ladder completed. He made up his clothes into a bundle, wrapped the <b>rough</b> <b>cloth</b> round his waist, {{adjusted}} the knot of horse hair {{on the top of his}} head, and fastened it there with wax. He wound the turban round below, and his disguise was complete.|$|E
60|$|Besides {{the arms}} there were great bales of <b>rough</b> <b>cloth</b> {{and piles of}} skins, all in a marvellous state of {{preservation}} owing to the dryness of the air. After thoroughly examining the room they went up the stairs leading into it and descended those into the adjoining chamber. This was divided into compartments by transverse walls four feet shorter than the width, thereby leaving a passage through from end to end. Here in confusion--for the most part turned inside out--were sacks of matting and bags of leather. One of the compartments was filled with great jars arranged in tiers. Some of the compartments were quite empty.|$|E
60|$|Day had by {{this time}} broken, and Malchus bade Clotilde enter a little wood to change her {{garments}} and dye her skin. He then proceeded to do the same, and rolling up the clothes he had taken off, hid them under a bush. Clotilde soon joined him again. She wore the dress of a peasant boy, consisting of a tunic of <b>rough</b> <b>cloth</b> reaching to her knees. Her limbs, face, and neck were dyed a sunny brown, and her hair, which was cut quite short, was blackened. Dyes were largely in use by Roman ladies, and Malchus had had no difficulty in procuring those necessary for their disguises.|$|E
50|$|Even {{though no}} longship sail has been found, {{accounts}} and depictions verify that longships had square sails. Sails measured perhaps 35 ft to 40 ft across, and {{were made of}} <b>rough</b> wool <b>cloth.</b> Unlike in knarrs, a longship sail was not stitched.|$|R
60|$|The {{next morning}} William Gale laid aside, for ever, his workhouse dress; {{and put on}} a suit of <b>rough</b> blue <b>cloth,</b> fitted for his future work. Then, bidding adieu to all his friends, he--with his five fellow apprentices--started by rail, under charge of Sam Dickson, for Yarmouth.|$|R
50|$|Wool {{remained}} {{the most popular}} fabric for all classes, followed by linen and hemp. Wool fabrics were available {{in a wide range}} of qualities, from <b>rough</b> undyed <b>cloth</b> to fine, dense broadcloth with a velvety nap; high-value broadcloth was a backbone of the English economy and was exported throughout Europe. Wool fabrics were dyed in rich colours, notably reds, greens, golds, and blues.|$|R
60|$|Forward and {{amidships}} surged {{the general}} fight: men plunged, swords fell, blood flowed, feet slipped upon the deck, and roars of blasphemy and pain {{rose above the}} noise of battle. But farther aft the two captains, in a space by themselves, cut, thrust, and trampled, whirling around each other, dashing from this side and that, ever with keen eyes firmly fixed, ever with strong arms whirling down and upward; now one man felt the keen cut of steel and now the other. The blood ran upon rich uniform or stained <b>rough</b> <b>cloth</b> and leather. It was a fight as if between a lioness and a tigress, their dead cubs near-by.|$|E
60|$|The women {{throughout}} the States {{were set to}} work spinning and weaving <b>rough</b> <b>cloth</b> and making uniforms from it. Leather, however, cannot be produced all at once, and indeed, with all their efforts, the Confederate authorities were never, {{throughout the}} war, able to provide a sufficient supply of boots for the troops, and many a battle was won by soldiers who fought almost barefooted, and who reshod themselves {{for the most part}} by stripping the boots from their dead foes. Many other articles could not be produced in the Southern States, and the Confederates suffered much from the want of proper medicines and surgical appliances.|$|E
60|$|They now dived {{into the}} back streets of the town, found a {{second-hand}} clothes shop, and speedily got the articles they required. Ralph had a long greatcoat, with a fur collar; {{and a pair of}} high boots, coming up to his knees and to be worn over the trousers. A black fur cap completed his costume. Percy had a black cap, made of <b>rough</b> <b>cloth,</b> with a peak and with flaps to come down over the ears; an old greatcoat, with fur round the pockets and collar; a bright-colored handkerchief, to go two or three times round the neck; and high boots like those of Ralph.|$|E
60|$|The costume of {{the women}} was as rude {{as that of the}} men. The schoolmaster's wife wore a sort of cloth helmet, and a <b>rough</b> yellow <b>cloth</b> gown, which was not by any means too long. Her little girl wore a tight-fitting skull-cap, and another youngster had on a thing much too large for it--like a huge extinguisher, which seemed to be its father's nightcap.|$|R
60|$|Chauvelin {{had already}} alighted from the coach. He was helping Marguerite to descend. Armand shook the {{stiffness}} from his limbs and {{followed in the}} wake of his sister. Always those miserable soldiers round them, with their dank coats of <b>rough</b> blue <b>cloth,</b> and the red caps on their heads! Armand pulled Marguerite's hand through his arm, and dragged her with him into the house.|$|R
5|$|Wool {{and hides}} were the major exports {{in the late}} Middle Ages. From 1327 to 1332, the {{earliest}} period for which figures survive, the annual average was 5,700 sacks of wool and 36,100 leather hides. The disruption of the Wars of Independence, which not only limited trade but damaged much of the valuable agricultural land of the Borders and Lowlands, meant that this fell in the period 1341–42 to 1342–43 to 2,450 sacks of wool and 17,900 hides. The trade recovered to reach a peak in the 1370s, with an annual average of 7,360 sacks, but the international recession from the 1380s saw a reduction to an annual average of 3,100 sacks. The introduction of sheep-scab was a serious blow to the wool trade from the early fifteenth century. Despite a levelling-off, in the Low Countries there was another drop in exports as the markets collapsed in the early-sixteenth century. Unlike in England, this did not prompt the Scots to turn to large-scale cloth production and only poor-quality <b>rough</b> <b>cloths</b> {{seem to have been}} significant.|$|R
6000|$|By {{the time}} he had made these {{observations}} the others had joined him. [...] "I see people there," [...] Dias said, in an awed voice, pointing to one end of the room. Harry dropped the barrel of his rifle into the palm of his left hand. After gazing two seconds he placed it on his shoulder, saying, [...] "There are people, Dias, but they won't do us any harm;" [...] and he walked in that direction. Two figures lay on the ground; four others were in a sitting position, close to each other, against the end wall. Some bows and arrows and spears lay near them. All were dressed in a garment of <b>rough</b> <b>cloth.</b> Harry walked up to one and touched it on the head with the muzzle of his gun. As he did so it crumbled away; the bones rattled on the stone floor as they fell. Donna Maria gave a little cry.|$|E
60|$|Another vision rose before Godfrey's mind. He beheld a low room {{having a}} kind of verandah, roofed with reeds, and beyond it a little {{courtyard}} enclosed by a wall of grey-coloured mud bricks, out of some of which stuck pieces of straw. This courtyard opened onto a narrow street where many oddly-clothed people walked up and down, some of whom wore peaked caps. A little man, old and grey, sat with the fragment of black rock on a low table before him, which Godfrey knew {{to be the same}} stone that he had already seen. By him lay graving tools, and he was engaged in polishing the stone, now covered with figures and writing, by help of a stick, a piece of <b>rough</b> <b>cloth</b> and oil. A young man with a curly beard walked into the little courtyard, and to him the old fellow delivered the engraved stone with obeisances, receiving payment in some curious currency.|$|E
60|$|He {{abruptly}} {{drew her}} head to his shoulder, smoothed her hair. She felt his fingers again communicate to her every nerve a tingling electric force. She felt his lips quest along her cheek and discover the soft little spot just behind her ear. She followed the restless course of his hands across her shoulders, down her arm, lingeringly over her hand. His hand seemed to her to have an existence quite apart from him, to have a mysterious existence of its own. In silence they rested there. She kept wondering if his shoulder had not been made just for her cheek. With little shivers she {{realized that this was}} his shoulder, Walter's, a man's, as the <b>rough</b> <b>cloth</b> prickled her skin. Silent they were, and for a time secure, but she kept speculating as to what he would dare to do next--and she fancied that he was speculating about precisely the same thing.|$|E
50|$|Munsterland, {{the area}} of land that {{straddles}} the German Dutch border was known for cotton. The soil was not fertile and from the 16th century additional income was gained from flax production to make linen, which was woven into a <b>rough</b> sail <b>cloth.</b> With the 19th century Bocholt was producing fustian (tree silk), a compound cloth of linen warp and cotton weft. This was exported. The textile merchants then established cotton mills that exploited these skills and trade links.|$|R
60|$|The cradle begat Long Tom and Broad Tom, the 'tom' proper {{being the}} upper {{box with a}} grating {{to keep out the}} pebbles. 'Long Tom's' body is a wooden trough, from twelve to {{fourteen}} feet long by a foot or {{a foot and a half}} broad, with ripples, riffles, or cross-bars. There is usually another grating at the lower end to intercept the smaller stones. The machine is fixed in a gently sloping position, at an angle determined by circumstances; the wash-dirt is lifted into the upper end by manual labour; when stiff it must be stirred or shovelled, and a stream of water does the rest. The greater gravity of the gold causes it to be arrested by the riffles. Instead of the bars grooves may be cut and filled with quicksilver. When the sludge is very rich, <b>rough</b> <b>cloths</b> rubbed with mercury, or even sheepskins, the lineal descendants of the Golden Fleece, may be used, 'Broad Tom,' alias the 'Victoria Jenny Lind,' is made about half the length of its long brother: the upper end is only a foot wide, broadening out to three below.|$|R
50|$|Most of the burghs were on {{the east}} coast, and among them were the largest and wealthiest, {{including}} Aberdeen, Perth and Edinburgh, whose growth was facilitated by trade with the continent. Although in the south-west Glasgow was beginning to develop and Ayr and Kirkcudbright had occasional links with Spain and France, sea trade with Ireland was much less profitable. In addition to the major royal burghs this era saw the proliferation of less baronial and ecclesiastical burghs, with 51 being created between 1450 and 1516. Most of these were much smaller than their royal counterparts, excluded from international trade they mainly acted as local markets and centres of craftsmanship. In general burghs probably carried out far more local trading with their hinterlands, relying on them for food, raw materials. The wool trade was a major export {{at the beginning of}} the period, but the introduction of sheep-scab was a serious blow to the trade and it began to decline as an export from the early 15th century and despite a levelling off, there was another drop in exports as the markets collapsed in the early-16th century Low Countries.

60|$|The {{wall was}} thick enough {{for men to}} walk along on the top, but being built of clay it would {{withstand}} but little battering. Mr. Goodenough set {{a large number of}} people to work, making sacks from the <b>rough</b> <b>cloth,</b> of which there was an abundance in the place. These were filled with earth and piled in the center of the town ready for conveyance to any point threatened. He likewise had a number of beams, used in construction of houses, sharpened at one end; stakes of five or six feet long were also prepared and sharpened at both ends. That day the enemy attempted nothing against the town. The next morning the twelve cannon were planted at a distance of about five hundred yards and opened fire on the walls. The shooting was wild in the extreme; many of the balls went over the place altogether; others topped the wall and fell in the town; some hit the wall and buried themselves in the clay.|$|E
6000|$|... "Get {{something}} that I could put over the clothes I wear. A long frock, some loose breeches, and <b>rough</b> <b>cloth</b> to wrap round the legs below them, {{and of course}} a pair of countryman's shoes. The best plan would be for you to stand treat again at a cabaret a few miles out of the town, get them all in there, then I could slip out of the waggon and throw the sacks back into their place. Of course you would choose some spot where the cabaret either stands alone or {{is at the end}} of a village, so that there may be no one standing by, and I could, when I got down, walk quietly back along the road. You can make signs to them that you live hard by, and would leave them there; then if there should be any suspicion that I had escaped in the waggons, and a troop of cavalry were sent in pursuit, the men would be all able to declare that they had seen nothing of me, and so could give no clue whatever that would set them on our track.|$|E
60|$|A {{quarter of}} an hour later Julian was {{equipped}} in the attire of a well-to-do peasant, with caftan lined with sheep-skin, a round fur cap, a thick pair of trousers of a dark <b>rough</b> <b>cloth,</b> bandages of the same material round the leg from the knee to the ankle, and high loose boots of untanned leather with the hair inside. The transformation greatly pleased the peasants, whose hatred of the French uniform had hitherto caused them to stand aloof from him, and they now patted him on the shoulder, shook his hand, and drank glasses of vodka, evidently to his health, with great heartiness. Julian could, as yet, scarcely believe that all this was not a dream. From the day that he had crossed the Niemen he had been filled with gloomy forebodings of disaster, and sickened by the barbarities of the soldiers upon the people, while, during the retreat, he had been exposed to constant hardship, engaged in innumerable fights and skirmishes, and impressed with the firm belief that not a Frenchman would ever cross the frontier save as a prisoner. After this the sense of warmth, the abundance of food, and the absence of any necessity for exertion seemed almost overpowering, and for the next three or four days he passed no small proportion of his time in sleep.|$|E
50|$|Even {{before the}} Spanish Era, the Tagalogs of Luzon wore a forerunner of the Barong Tagalog - the Baro. Earliest {{reference}} to the Baro was in the Historical account of Ma-i (Pre-Colonial name for the Philippines) that the Filipinos wore a sleeve-doublet of <b>rough</b> cotton <b>cloth</b> called kanga, reaching slightly below the waist.
