40|$|We {{present a}} novel inertial-isolation {{scheme based on}} six degree-of-freedom (6 D) {{interferometric}} readout of a single <b>reference</b> <b>mass.</b> It is capable of reducing inertial motion by more than two orders of magnitude at 100 mHz compared with what is achievable with state-of-the-art seismometers. This would in turn dramatically improve the low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational-wave detectors. The scheme is inherently two-stage, the <b>reference</b> <b>mass</b> is softly suspended within the platform to be isolated, which is itself suspended from the ground. The platform is held constant relative to the <b>reference</b> <b>mass</b> and this closed-loop control effectively transfers the low force-noise of the <b>reference</b> <b>mass</b> to the platform.

Characterizations are performed with asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AsFlFFF). Furthermore, we study the effect of homogenization on the molar <b>mass,</b> <b>rms</b> radius (r rms) and hydrodynamic radius (r h). For the untreated sample, the macromolecules are elongated objects with low apparent density. As a result of homogenization, molar <b>mass,</b> and r <b>rms</b> decrease, while r h remains unaffected. The process also induces an increase, and scaling with size, of apparent density as well as changes in conformation, represented qualitatively by r rms/ r h. Finally, results from AsFlFFF are compared with viscosimetry and {{discussed in terms of}} concentration and close-packing in relation to macromolecular shape and conformation. Hence, the results show that AsFlFFF and our novel methodology enable the determination of several physical properties with high relevance for the solution behavior of polydisperse macromolecules...|$|R

40|$|In this study, a {{new idea}} for {{developing}} a space scale for measuring mass in a microgravity environment was proposed by using the inertial force properties of an object to measure its mass.
