50|$|For 700 g of fish, finely chop {{an onion}} and saute it with oil, parsley, and two whole cloves of garlic. The moment the onion starts to brown, add 300 g of chopped from {{tomatoes}} or tomato paste, {{and season with}} salt and pepper. When the tomatoes are cooked, pour in one finger of strong vinegar or two fingers of weak vinegar, diluted in a large glass of water. Let boil for a few more minutes, then discard the garlic and strain the rest of the ingredients, pressing hard against the mesh. Put the strained sauce back on the fire along with whatever fish you may have on hand, including sole, <b>red</b> mullet, <b>gurnard,</b> dogfish, mantis shrimp, and other types of fish in season, leaving the small fish whole and cutting the big ones into small pieces. Taste for seasoning; but in any case it is not a bad idea to add a little olive oil, since the amount of soffritto was quite small. When the fish is cooked, the cacciucco is usually brought to the table on two separate platters: on one you place the fish, strained from the broth, and on the other you arrange enough finger-thick slices of bread to soak up all the broth.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{contributions}} of the current EU Data Collection Framework (DCF) was the shift from a stock-based approach towards a fishery-based approach. The aim of this change was serving the new demands of the fisheries management in order to include the ecosystem approach in the assessments. Since 2009, the MS national fisheries sampling programs had to adopt the concurrent sampling strategy, which implies that length structure of all species landed must be obtained during the sampling operation. The Northern Spanish coastal small scale fleet represents a major challenge for sampling due to the multi-species and multi-gear character and {{the complexity of the}} fleets’ dynamics. Particularly, the small-scale gillnets called “beta” represents one the more complex Spanish métiers in terms of catches (1850 t in 2014), effort (23341 trips), geographical distribution (Division VIIIc and IXa), and the number of exploited species (38 species within 90 % of total landings). Some of the most important species are hake, horse mackerel, pouting, <b>red</b> mullet, pollack, <b>gurnards,</b> small-spotted catshark or sole. The analytical approach adopted here is to compare, under statistical and logistical perspectives, the biological data compiled for the North-western Spanish small-scale gillnets before and after the concurrent sampling implementation. The potential improvement in stock assessment and fisheries management are also considered...|$|R

It is also present in the Mediterranean Sea and possibly the Black Sea. Its depth range is from the surface down to about 400 m but it is most usually found between 30 and 250 m. It is found over sand, shingle or rocky seabeds and feeds on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as crustaceans, and also small fish.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{different}} species that instigate predation on C.lavauxi. Because they inhabit the area where the tide does not often reach, their predators are not generally fish but birds. Their main predators are generalist birds such as Seagulls or Kingfisher. The major form of predation from fish includes the Smooth Hound Fish, Spined Dogfish, Terakihi, Sea Perch, Moki and <b>Red</b> <b>Gurnard.</b> One defense mechanism the crab has is being able to live on the beaches where fish are unable to eat them.

50|$|Gurnards {{are very}} {{distinctive}} bottom-living fish with large heads and eyes. The head {{is protected by}} large bony plates and strong spines. The lower three rays of the pectoral fins are separate, finger-like processes that contain sensory organs. These are used by the gurnard to 'feel' for small fish, crustaceans and other invertebrates living in the sediment. The <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> has a stout body, large head and eyes and moderately large scales. It {{is one of the}} smallest of the European gurnards reaching a maximum length of 40 cm. The coloration is bright red with pinkish-silver mottling on the sides and head. The protective bony plates on the head which are characteristic of all gurnards are very conspicuous in this species. Along the lateral line there is a row of large, plate-like scales. The divided dorsal fin has nine spines and seventeen to eighteen soft rays while the anal fin has no spines and sixteen to eighteen soft rays.|$|E
40|$|Ontogenetic {{changes in}} the feeding habits and dietary overlap of the <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> Aspitrigla cuculus inhabiting the waters of North-East Atlantic were investigated. The feeding ecology of <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Triglidae) has been well studied in the Mediterranean Sea {{but there has been}} little {{research}} carried out on the feeding behaviour of these species in British waters since the 1930 ’s. Further analysis of the dietary habits of <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> in British waters is needed to understand the ontogenetic and seasonal changes in prey choice exhibited by the species and understand the implications of commercial fisheries on these fish and their prey, This study revealed that ontogenetic shifts were present in diet composition, niche breadth and dietary overlap of the <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> Aspitrigla cuculus. Large <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> (> 20 cm) have a piscivorous diet and feed mainly on Callionymus lyra, whilst smaller gurnard prey predominantly upon benthic amphipods and carideans. Dietary overlap was highest between small red gurnard: ( 20 cm) having significantly different feeding habits than the small (< 14. 9 cm) and midsized sized (15 - 19. 9 cm) <b>red</b> <b>gurnard.</b> Temporal variation was observed in the feeding spectra of mid-sized <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> throughout the year. There has been a shift in the feeding behaviour of <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> between 1930 and 2004. The prey groups Galathea and Porcellana were the greatest contributors to the dissimilarity between dietary samples from 1930 and 2004...|$|E
40|$|The feeding {{habits of}} the three most {{abundant}} gurnard species, <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Aspitrigla cuculus), large scale gurnard (Lepidotrigla cavillone) and rock gurnard (Trigloporus lastoviza) in the eastern Mediterranean (Dodecanese and Cyclades, Greece) are examined. The stomach contents of the gurnard specimens collected in April and September 1996 by bottom trawling were analyzed. The % frequency of occurrence, % number and % weight of prey types in the stomach contents were evaluated. By weight, Mysidacea and Decapoda dominated in the diet of the three species in both seasons, however the Index of Relative Importance, {{as well as the}} percentage frequency of occurrence varied. Rock gurnard presented the most diverse diet whereas the diet of large scale and <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> were more specialized. High overlap in terms of number was found between rock and large scale gurnard in May. Rock gurnard had the most divers diet in both seasons...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTotal mercury {{concentrations}} were determined in different fish {{size classes of}} commercial importance such as, conger eel (Conger conger), starry ray (Raja asterias), forkbeard (Phycis blennoides), frostfish (Lepidopus caudatus), striped mullet (Mullus barbatus), <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Aspitrigla cuculus) and yellow gurnard (Trigla lucerna) in order to evaluate eventual variations in consumer exposure to mercury {{as a function of}} fish consumption of different size spectra. The highest mean levels of total mercury were detected in conger eel (0. 80 μg g- 1) and in starry ray (0. 75 μg g- 1). Forkbeard (0. 67 μ g g- 1), frostfish (0. 59 gμ g- 1) and striped mullet (0. 55 μg g- 1) showed slightly lower levels, while <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> (0. 33 μg g- 1) and yellow gurnard (0. 22 μg g- 1) exhibited the lowest concentrations. The results of the linear regression analysis showed significant relationship between mercury concentrations and fish size for all species. Consequently, dietary consumption of larger size specimens leaded to an increase in the exposure level for consumer. Understanding by consumers of all factors leading to an increase of exposure to mercury is the first step to address them to make decisions about eating fish...|$|E
40|$|Back calculation, {{marginal}} increment {{analysis and}} modal progression analysis {{were used to}} trace growth processes of the <b>red</b> <b>gurnard,</b> Aspitrigla cuculus L., in the Mediterranean Sea. Three false rings appeared regularly on otoliths and were hypothesized {{to refer to the}} ontogeny {{on the basis of the}} study of the recruitment and reproduction processes of the species. The first two rings were laid down during the first pelagic period and the transformation to the bottom mode of life, respectively. The third ring corresponded to the first spawning at the end of the second year of life. The marginal increment analysis demonstrated that one opaque and one translucent zone is formed each year, the translucent ring corresponding to the period of slow growth in the winter. Temperature and salinity of Mediterranean waters below the thermocline where <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> live do not undergo seasonal variations. Therefore, traditional interpretation of the discontinuity patterns on otoliths related to the decrease of water temperature should be rejected for Mediterranean fish distributed on the deep shelf and slope. Discontinuities in otolith structure may be related to seasonal variation in feeding intensity as a consequence of decreases in the benthic mysids biomass and time available to find food due to reduced daylight. Future research should focus on the trophic ecology of the demersal fishes and the seasonal fluctuations of the prey resources during the year in order to assess the role of the food supply with regard to otolith growth patterns in the Mediterranean Sea...|$|E

40|$|Patterns in the {{abundance}} of commercially important and non-target demersal fish species collected by beam trawl survey from the coastal waters of the northeast Atlantic are described. Catches were dominated by {{a small number of}} species, which occurred in large numbers and at high biomass. The most abundant species (plaice and dab) were typical of shallow, uniform sandy and muddy seabed which occurred extensively throughout the southern North Sea, and to a limited extent in UK western waters. Renyi's diversity index family was used to rank the diversity of coastal sectors throughout the region. The less species-rich North Sea fauna, partly a result of the uniform nature of the seabed was largely responsible for lower diversity of North Sea coastal faunas compared to those in the Channel and west of the UK West of the Dover Strait, the more heterogeneous substrate supported a more diverse fauna of smaller sized fish, with the occurrence of southern species such as <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> and thickback sole and an increasing abundance of elasmobranchs. In the Irish Sea, fish biomass was dominated by plaice and dab, but to a lesser extent than on the continental coast of the North Sea. Sole, lesser spotted dogfish and cod were also important in this assemblage. Patterns in community structure over such a wide spatial scale, and without historical perspective, can be explained by biogeographic factors, seabed structure and the influence of regional hydrography. Inferring from these patterns an impact of anthropogenic factors (such as towed fishing gears) is unlikely to be achieved. Identifying vulnerable species, and use of fi 5 hing effort distribution data of high resolution, may be a more fruitful approach...|$|E
40|$|Demersal {{fisheries}} targeting a few high-value species often {{catch and}} discard other “non-target” species. It {{is difficult to}} quantify {{the impact of this}} incidental mortality when population biomass of a non-target species is unknown. We calculate biomass for 14 demersal fish species in ICES Area VIIg (Celtic Sea) by applying species- and length-based catchability corrections to catch records from the Irish Groundfish Survey (IGFS). We then combine these biomass estimates with records of commercial discards (and landings for marketable non-target species) to calculate annual harvesting rates (HR) for each study species. Uncertainty is incorporated into estimates of both biomass and HR. Our survey-based HR estimates for cod and whiting compared well with HR-converted fishing mortality (F) estimates from analytical assessments for these two stocks. Of the non-target species tested, <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Chelidonichthys cuculus) recorded some annual HRs greater than those for cod or whiting; challenging “Pope's postulate” that F on non-target stocks in an assemblage will not exceed that on target stocks. We relate HR for each species to two corresponding maximum sustainable yield (MSY) reference levels; six non-target species (including three ray species) show annual HRs ≥ HRMSY. This result suggests that it may not be possible to conserve vulnerable non-target species when F is coupled to that of target species. Based on biomass, HR, and HRMSY, we estimate “total allowable catch” for each non-target species.
