25|$|The primary {{beneficiaries}} of the property tax are county boards of education. Property taxes are paid to the sheriff {{of each of the}} state's 55 counties. Each county and municipality can impose its own rates of property taxation within the limits set by the West Virginia Constitution. The West Virginia legislature sets the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> of county boards of education. This rate is used by all county boards of education statewide. However, the total tax rate for county boards of education may differ from county to county because of excess levies. The Department of Tax and Revenue supervises and otherwise assists counties and municipalities in their work of assessment and tax rate determination. The total tax rate is a combination of the tax levies from four state taxing authorities: state, county, schools and municipal. This total tax rate varies {{for each of the four}} classes of property, which consists of personal, real and intangible properties. Property is assessed according to its use, location and value as of July 1. All property is reappraised every three years; annual adjustments are made to assessments for property with a change of value. West Virginia does not impose an inheritance tax. Because of the phase-out of the federal estate tax credit, West Virginia's estate tax is not imposed on estates of persons who died on or after January 1, 2005.|$|E

Cultures differ in many respects but do those differences result in materially different <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> compliance as well? In other words, are some cultures more law abiding than others – at least with respect to tax law? This paper will address that question. Its objective is {{to test the hypothesis}} that certain aspects of a nation’s culture impact the level <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> evasion within that country. More specifically, do countries with lower levels of compliance with laws in general also experience lower levels <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> compliance or, in other words greater <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> evasion? Tests conducted utilizing ordinary least squares regression indicate that countries with lower levels of complying with laws in general do indeed experience lower levels <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> compliance...|$|R

2500|$|Wilson's {{government}} made {{a variety of}} changes to the tax system. Largely {{under the influence of}} the Hungarian-born economists Nicholas Kaldor and Thomas Balogh, an idiosyncratic Selective Employment Tax (SET) was introduced that was designed to tax employment in the service sectors while subsidising employment in manufacturing. (The rationale proposed by its economist authors derived largely from claims about potential economies of scale and technological progress, but Wilson in his memoirs stressed the tax's revenue-raising potential.) The SET did not long survive the return of a Conservative government. Of longer-term significance, Capital Gains Tax (CGT) was introduced across the UK on 6 April 1965. Across his two periods in office, Wilson presided over significant increases in the overall tax burden in the UK. In 1974, three weeks after forming a new government, Wilson's new chancellor Denis Healey partially reversed the 1971 reduction in the top <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> from 90% to 75%, increasing it to 83% in his first budget, which came into law in April 1974. This applied to incomes over £20,000 (equivalent to £ in [...] ),, and combined with a 15% surcharge on 'un-earned' income (investments and dividends) could add to a 98% marginal rate of personal income tax. In 1974, as many as 750,000 people were liable to pay the top-rate of income tax. Labour's identification with high tax rates was to prove one of the issues that helped the Conservative Party under Margaret Thatcher and John Major dominate British politics during the 1980s and early-to-mid-1990s.|$|E
2500|$|Just {{prior to}} the {{entrance}} of the United States into World War II, the Revenue Act of 1941 was passed into law. In addition to increasing the rate on long distance calls, it also imposed the tax on “general” or local telephone service for the first time. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> for local telephone service was set at 6 percent of the amount paid by subscribers while that for long distance calls was set at 5 cents for each 50 cents or fraction thereof, if the cost of the message was greater than 24 cents. Other legislation was subsequently enacted during World War II — the Revenue Act of 1942 [...] and the Revenue Act of 1943. The tax rates on telephone service reached their all-time high under provisions of the Revenue Act of 1943. Rates were 15 percent on local telephone calls and 25 percent (on messages which cost more than 24 cents) on long distance calls. The Revenue Act of 1943 also provided for the increased excise tax rates to expire. In the case of the excise taxes on telephone service, the law provided that the increased rates would end six months after the “date of termination of hostilities in the present war.” The law defined the termination date as that date proclaimed by either the President or the date specified in a concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress, whichever is the earlier. In a reversal of this position, the Excise Tax Act of 1947 [...] continued the rates indefinitely.|$|E
5000|$|Offshore {{investment}} is the keeping {{of money in}} a jurisdiction other than one's country of residence. Offshore jurisdictions are a commonly accepted means <b>of</b> reducing the <b>taxes</b> levied in most countries to both large and small-scale investors alike.
