The lake has a maximum {{surface area of}} 975 acres and a volume of 7, 150 acre-feet. Samples of fish killed after chemical treatment included coarsescale suckers 69. 2 per cent, squawfish 24. 5 per cent, redside shiners 3. 0 per cent, black bullhead 2. 0 per cent and bridgelip suckers 1. 3 per cent. Chemical treatment of approximately 55 miles of tributary streams above Upper Cow Lake was completed in August and September, 1963. Twelve miles of tributary streams located in Idaho were treated by the Idaho <b>Game</b> Department personnel. <b>Restocking</b> of the lake with rainbow trout will begin in 1964. Very little of the tributary system is suitable for <b>restocking</b> of <b>game</b> fish. " (Abstract from Author...|$|R
40|$|Pheasant {{coronavirus}} (PhCoV) {{has been}} {{isolated in the}} UK and Italy {{in the last few}} decades. A serological survey was carried out in the Emilia-Romagna Region (Northern Italy) in order to establish the occurrence and spread of coronavirus infection in farm-bred and free-living pheasants. Seven hundred and four sera were obtained during 1998 from 16 game farms. 275 sera were collected from 1995 to 2002 from free-living pheasants, belonging to a natural population: these were classified as “wild” and “restocked” (a few reared birds released in the study area). A blocking ELISA (Svanovir®) test was employed for the detection of antibodies cross reactive to Infectious Bronchitis Virus in sera. Seropositive animals were detected in 5 out 16 game farms examined, while only two free-living pheasants (a restocked bird and an unclassified one) were seropositive. These data confirm that the infection was present in Italian-reared pheasants, but the free-living sampled population appeared to be free from the infection. The authors emphasise the risk of spreading the infection to wild bird populations by <b>game</b> <b>restocking</b> activities...|$|R
40|$|Introduction of {{wildlife}} for <b>game</b> <b>restocking</b> is one major pathway of genetic homogenization. The redlegged partridge (Alectoris rufa, Phasianidae), a small game bird native to south-western Europe, is {{in high demand}} by hunters and natural populations are constantly supplemented by commercial stocks of captive- bred individuals. Also, in recent years human-mediated hybridization with congeneric chukar partridges (Alectoris chukar: Greece, Cyprus, from Middle East to East Asia) has been frequently documented in the wild and in captivity. This study attempts to evaluate the genetic consequences of intensive captive breeding and restocking in the A. rufa species. We investigated A. rufa genetic diversity by making comparisons in both a spatial (across the entire species’ range) and a temporal framework. We accomplished this latter by comparing modern vs. ancient partridges resident in museums and collected 1856 – 1934, well before supplemental stocking became common. Using mtDNA we found {{significant changes in the}} haplotype profile of modern vs. ancient A. rufa, and widespread introgression with chukar genes across the entire species range only in modern representatives, with the relevant exception of Corsican populations. However, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), as opposed to microsatellite DNA markers, showed also modern Corsican populations to harbour many A. rufa A. chukar hybrids. We conclude that captive breeding programs should make strict use of time-saving and comparatively low cost DNA barcodes to minimize genetic pollution, such as those provided by diagnostic RAPD markers. We also recommend that the active ban on import of exotics and/or hybrids be extended to non-local populations. Altogether this would represent a substantial step forward to preserve A. rufa as well as other game species subjected to similar intensive management...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring {{the last}} decade, {{the role of}} {{wildlife}} in emerging pathogen transmission to domestic animals has often been pointed out. Conversely, far less {{attention has been paid}} to pathogen transmission from domestic animals to wildlife. Here, we focus on the case of <b>game</b> <b>restocking,</b> which implies the release of millions of animals worldwide each year. We conducted a 2 -year study in the Camargue (Southern France) to investigate the influence of hand-reared Mallard releases on avian influenza virus dynamics in surrounding wildlife. We sampled Mallards (cloacal swabs) from several game duck facilities in 2009 and 2010 before their release. A very high (99 %) infection rate caused by an H 10 N 7 strain was detected in the game bird facility we sampled in 2009. We did not detect this strain in shot ducks we sampled, neither during the infection rates ranged from 0 to 24 % in hand-reared ducks. The 2009 H 10 N 7 strain was fully sequenced. It results from multiple reassortment events between Eurasian low pathogenic strains. Interestingly, H 10 N 7 strains had previously caused human infections in Egypt and Australia. The H 10 and N 7 segments we sequenced were clearly distinct from the Australian ones but they belonged to the same large cluster as the Egyptian ones. We did not observe any mutation linked to increased virulence, transmission to mammals, or antiviral resistance in the H 10 N 7 strain we identified. Our results indicate that the potential role of hand-reared Mallards in influenza virus epizootics must be taken into account given the likely risk of viral exchange between game bird facilities and wild habitats, owing to duck rearing conditions. Measures implemented to limit transmission from wildlife to domestic animals as well as measures to control transmission from domestic animals to wild ones need to be equally reinforced...|$|R
40|$|Background: The common quail, Coturnix coturnix, is a {{migratory bird}} hunted {{extensively}} across Europe. To satisfy this hunting interest, thousands of farm-reared birds are restocked every year. However, restocked individuals are not common quail but hybrids with domestic Japanese quail, C. japonica. Interbreeding between restocked and native {{birds in the}} wild allows the entry of alien alleles to the native populations, {{which could lead to}} the loss of adaptive phenotypes and behaviours, such as migratory drive. Sedentary individuals may face wintering conditions to which they are not adapted, suffering higher mortality. Some individuals have been observed to remain in northern latitudes during winter. Question: Does <b>game</b> <b>restocking</b> contribute to the sedentarization of the common quail population? Method: We sampled 42 quail during the autumn migration and 50 quail during winter in Spain. We genetically analysed them using a set of autosomal microsatellites and also sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial DNA control region. We evaluated the proportion of admixed quail found and compared it with that previously found in a breeding population. Results: None of the migratory quail were admixed individuals, although two of them showed introgression of Japanese mitochondrial DNA. Among wintering quail, only three individuals had a genetic composition compatible with a farm origin, while the rest were common quail. Thus, the proportion of admixed quail during winter was not higher than during the breeding season. Conclusion: Restocking individuals with domestic Japanese quail ancestry is not directly associated with the presence of quail during winter in northern latitudes. The almost complete absence of individuals of farm origin among the migratory and wintering quail populations indicates {{that the vast majority of}} the restocked individuals probably die soon after release. However, the genetic composition of the breeding population has already shown that some survive until the next breeding season and introgress their genes into the wild population...|$|R

5000|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, members of the {{wildlife}} conservation group Boone and Crockett Club had determined that extinction of the pronghorn was more of a probability than a possibility. In a letter from George Bird Grinnell, Boone and Crockett Club chairman of the game preservation committee, to Walter L. Fisher, Secretary of the Interior, Grinnell stated, [...] "The Club is much concerned about the fate of the pronghorn which appears to be everywhere rapidly diminishing." [...] By the 1920s, hunting pressure had reduced the pronghorn population to about 13,000. Boone and Crockett Club member Charles Alexander Sheldon, in a letter to fellow member Grinnell, wrote, [...] "Personally, I think that the antelope are doomed, yet every attempt should be made to save them." [...] Although the Club had begun their efforts to save the pronghorn in 1910 by funding and <b>restocking</b> the Wichita <b>Game</b> Refuge in Kansas, the National Bison Range in Montana, and the Wind Cave National Park, in South Dakota, most of the efforts were doomed since experience demonstrated that after initial increases the pronghorns would die off because of the fenced enclosures. In 1927, Grinnell spearheaded efforts along with the help of T. Gilbert Pearson of Grinnell's National Audubon Society to create the Charles Alexander Sheldon Antelope Refuge in northern Nevada. About 2900 acres of land were jointly purchased by the two organizations and subsequently turned over to the Biological Survey as a pronghorn refuge. This donation was contingent upon the government's adding 30,000 acres of surrounding public lands. On June 20, 1929, President Hoover included the required public lands upon request of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior after learning that the Boone and Crockett Club and the National Audubon Society were underwriting the private land buyout. On January 26, 1931, Hoover signed the executive order for the refuge. On December 31, 1936, president Franklin Roosevelt signed an executive order creating a 549,000-acre tract; this was the true beginning for pronghorn recovery in North America.|$|R
