5|$|A <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> of {{the game}} was resubmitted to the ACB and {{reclassified}} as MA 15+ on August 7, 2008, or not suitable for people {{under the age of}} 15 unless accompanied by a parent or adult guardian; this new rating ensured that the game could retail legally in Australia. According to the ACB board report, the drug content was not removed entirely from the <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> {{of the game}}, but the animation showing the actual usage of the drugs was removed; the minority view on the decision stated that the drug content was still enough to warrant a refused classification rating.|$|E

Coolsma's wife died on 27 September 1917.

5|$|By the mid-1st {{millennium}} BC, hieroglyphs and hieratic {{were still}} used for royal, monumental, religious, and funerary writings, while a new, even more cursive script {{was used for}} informal, day-to-day writing: Demotic. The final script adopted by the ancient Egyptians was the Coptic alphabet, a <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> of the Greek alphabet. Coptic became the standard in the 4th century AD when Christianity became the state religion throughout the Roman Empire; hieroglyphs were discarded as idolatrous images of a pagan tradition, unfit for writing the Biblical canon.|$|E

It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher.

5|$|If a {{publisher}} {{does not agree}} with the rating that they were assigned, they may edit the game and submit the <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating. There is also an appeals process, but it has never been used.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the Actor Rebellion of 1733, Fielding produced a <b>revised</b> <b>version</b> of The Author's Farce, incorporating a new prologue and epilogue. Performed at the Theatre Royal, it was advertised in the Daily Journal, opening with an inferior replacement cast {{for some of the}} important characters. It was joined by The Intriguing Chambermaid and The Harlot's Progress. These were the only performances of the <b>revised</b> <b>version,</b> which was printed together with The Intriguing Chambermade (1734) and included a letter by an unknown writer, possibly Fielding himself. The 1734 edition of the play was printed in 1750, and it was used for all later publications until 1966. Printed texts of the play were included in Arthur Murphy's 1762 Works of Henry Fielding and George Saintsbury's 1893 Works of Henry Fielding. The latter includes The Author's Farce along with only two other plays. The 1903 Works of Henry Fielding, edited by G. H. Maynadier, included only the first two acts. Only three scenes were included in Alfred Howard's The Beauties of Fielding, which collected passages from Fielding's works. George Saintsbury included The Author's Farce and two other plays in a Fielding collected edition of 1893, but ignored the others.|$|E

Both were designed around the more powerful DB 600A engines, delivering about 746kW (1,000hp). Two L and one M versions were built as prototypes, both with another MG 15 in the nose. The first prototype of the <b>revised</b> <b>version,</b> the Do 17M V1 (D-ABVD) was powered by two DB 600s, and demonstrated impressive performance, including a maximum speed of 425km/h (264mph).|$|E
