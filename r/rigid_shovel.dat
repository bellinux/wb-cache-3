40|$|A neurally-inspired visual object {{recognition}} system is described called seemore, whose {{goal is to}} identify common objects from a large known set [...] -independent of 3 -D viewing angle, distance, and non-rigid distortion. seemore's database consists of 100 objects that are <b>rigid</b> (<b>shovel),</b> non-rigid (telephone cord), articulated (book), statistical (shrubbery), and complex (photographs of scenes). Recognition results were obtained using a set of 102 color and shape feature channels within a simple feedforward network architecture...|$|E
40|$|Severe {{architectural}} {{and timing}} constraints within the primate visual system support the conjecture {{that the early}} phase of object recognition in the brain {{is based on a}} feedforward feature-extraction hierarchy. To assess the plausibility of this conjecture in an engineering context, a difficult 3 -D object recognition domain was developed to challenge a pure feedforward, receptive-field-based recognition model called seemore. seemore is based on 102 viewpoint-invariant nonlinear filters which are as a group sensitive to contour, texture, and color cues. The visual domain consists of 100 real objects of many different types, including <b>rigid</b> (<b>shovel),</b> non-rigid (telephone cord), and statistical (maple leaf cluster) objects, and photographs of complex scenes. Objects were individually-presented in color video images under normal room lighting conditions. Based on 12 - 36 training views, seemore was required to recognize un-normalized test views of objects that could vary in position, orien [...] ...|$|E
