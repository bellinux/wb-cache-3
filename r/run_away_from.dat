She was also carrying multiple mobile phones, as well as a laptop. She appeared to be paranoid and constantly looked out of the windows; this behaviour caused Molloy to assume that she had <b>run</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> an abusive partner.

He would often <b>run</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home to go to his grandmother's to hear her talk about the pioneer days of covered-wagons. As a child, Smith attended public schools in Oregon. After high school he attended two years at Principia College in St. Louis, Missouri, but did not graduate.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} {{habits of}} the Sumatran rhinoceros have been studied in captivity. Sexual relationships begin with a courtship period characterized by increased vocalization, tail raising, urination, and increased physical contact, with {{both male and female}} using their snouts to bump the other in the head and genitals. The pattern of courtship is most {{similar to that of the}} black rhinoceros. Young Sumatran rhino males are often too aggressive with females, sometimes injuring and even killing them during the courtship. In the wild, the female could <b>run</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> an overly aggressive male, but in their smaller captive enclosures, they cannot; this inability to escape aggressive males may partly contribute to the low success rate of captive-breeding programs.|$|E

5|$|Convinced {{that he has}} {{not done}} {{anything}} wrong, Bart decides to <b>run</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home, taking Santa's Little Helper with him. While wandering the streets, he visits a breadline that is serving Thanksgiving dinner for homeless people. A television crew led by Kent Brockman is covering the event, and they interview Bart. The family sees the report on television and calls the police, hoping that they can find Bart and return him. When the police fail, Homer and Marge start to regret the bad things they said to Bart, who eventually returns home feeling remorseful. However, his dilemma is worsened when he imagines his family blaming him for everything if he apologized for ruining Thanksgiving. Back to the present, he realizes that it was all his own imagination. He climbs up onto the roof of the house to think things out. Hearing Lisa cry because she misses him, Bart calls for her to come onto the roof. He then realizes that what he did was wrong and apologizes to her. Bart later rejoins the family to enjoy a meal of Thanksgiving leftovers.|$|E
5|$|Don't Look Now is {{particularly}} indebted to Alfred Hitchcock, exhibiting several {{characteristics of the}} director's work. The aural match cut following Christine's death from Laura's scream to the screech of a drill references a cut in The 39 Steps, when a woman's scream cuts to the whistle of a steam train. When John reports Laura's disappearance to the Italian police he inadvertently becomes {{a suspect in the}} murder case they are investigating—an innocent man being wrongly accused and pursued by the authorities is a common Hitchcock trait. The film also takes a Hitchcockian approach to its mise en scène, by manifesting its protagonist's psychology in plot developments: in taking their trip to Venice the Baxters have <b>run</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> personal tragedy, and are often physically depicted as running to and from things during their stay in Venice; the labyrinthine geography of Venice causes John to lose his bearings, and he often becomes separated from Laura and is repeatedly shown to be looking for her—both physical realisations {{of what is going on}} in his head.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of Fraser's novels, Flashman goes from his {{expulsion}} from school into the army. Although he is a coward who tries to <b>run</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> any danger, he is involved in many famous military episodes from the 19th century, often taking actions that cause or affect subsequent events, such as his flatulence affecting the Charge of the Light Brigade, or being the person who probably shot George Armstrong Custer. When circumstances run against him and he is forced to fight, he often does so bravely and capably. Despite his cowardice and his attempts to flee, he becomes a decorated war hero and rises {{to the rank of}} brigadier-general. He also meets people who either were notable at the time—such as Benjamin Disraeli and the Duke of Wellington—or who became well-known after Flashman met them—such as Abraham Lincoln. Flashman either has, or tries to have, sex with most of the female characters: {{by the end of the}} ninth book he estimates that he has had sex with 480 women.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} chooses the Truth door, Tapp pursues a mysterious cloaked figure who he {{believes}} to be Jigsaw. After catching and brutally beating the figure, Tapp realizes {{that it is}} actually Melissa Sing, a victim whom Tapp had saved earlier in the game. A tape found on Melissa explains that Jigsaw had put her in charge of keeping Tapp alive and making sure he followed the rules of Jigsaw's game after Tapp rescued her. Jigsaw had kidnapped her son and had Pighead sew her mouth shut to avoid her spoiling Tapp's test. Attempting to <b>run</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Tapp, Melissa desperately charges through a nearby door rigged with a shotgun, which kills her {{in the same way}} as her late husband, Steven Sing. Tapp suffers a mental breakdown as a result of her death and is placed in a functional asylum where he still believes he is playing Jigsaw's games.|$|E

Ruksar and Govind meet again and hit it off at a party, but Govind notices a photo journalist following them. He holds Radhika's hand to mislead the journalist, unaware that Radhika has {{fallen in love with}} him. Radhika is the best friend Ruksar had run away with, and the two tell each other about the man they've fallen in love with, not realising he is the same person. When Ruksar, Radhika and Govind all meet, the three realise what happened and brokenheartedly part ways.|$|E
5|$|In early 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913–1994), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish descent. She had <b>run</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home, {{intent on}} making {{a career in}} dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London's West End. Laying his head in her lap, a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed {{together}} ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, {{and in the second}} half of 1936 were courting. They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937. In early 1938 they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire.

Midway through the series, she and Adam start a brief love affair, which ends in the {{penultimate}} episode. In the fifth series, particularly in its later episodes, Adam suffers from several mental breakdowns following the loss of Fiona. He has recurring nightmares that involve his being wounded and unable to return home to his son, and in the eighth episode, he has a panic attack after learning that Wes has briefly <b>run</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> home; this attack jeopardises his life during an operation. In the series finale, Adam is revealed to be suicidally depressed, wishing he had died in Fiona's place. But after another panic attack, {{he is able to}} pull through, save fellow officer Ros Myers (Hermione Norris), and escape from the Thames Barrier before they both drown.|$|E

5|$|The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes is a children's {{book written}} and {{illustrated}} by Beatrix Potter, and published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1911. Timmy Tiptoes is a squirrel believed to be a nut-thief by his fellows, and imprisoned by them in a hollow tree with the expectation that he will confess under confinement. Timmy is tended by Chippy Hackee, a friendly, mischievous chipmunk who has <b>run</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> his wife and is camping-out in the tree. Chippy urges the prisoner to eat the nuts stored in the tree, and Timmy does so but grows so fat he cannot escape the tree. He regains his freedom when a storm topples part of the tree. The tale contrasts the harmonious marriage of its title character with the less than harmonious marriage of the chipmunk.|$|E
