She is a figurative painter, currently working in the Magical Realist style but some of her works are closer to Surrealism, her subjects are mostly women and recently many of her works are in the form of self-portraits. She has been known for her works in watercolors and pencil, but her recent works are also produced with acrylic on canvas, <b>recreations</b> and <b>installation.</b>|$|R

40|$|West Nile virus (WNV) is {{maintained}} in nature in an enzootic transmission cycle between birds and mosquitoes, although it occasionally infects other vertebrates, including humans, {{in which it}} may result fatal. To date, no licensed vaccines against WNV infection are available for birds, but its availability would certainly benefit certain populations, as birds grown for restocking, hunting activities, or alimentary purposes, and those confined to wildlife reservations and <b>recreation</b> <b>installations.</b> We have tested the protective capability of WNV envelope recombinant (rE) protein in red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa). Birds (n= 28) were intramuscularly immunized three times at 2 -weeks interval with rE and a control group (n= 29) was sham-immunized. Except for 5 sham-immunized birds that were not infected and housed as contact controls, partridges were subcutaneously challenged with WNV. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and feather pulps were collected at several days after infection and blood samples were taken during vaccination and after infection. All rE-vaccinated partridges elicited anti-WNV antibodies before challenge and survived to the infection, while 33. 3 % of the sham-immunized birds succumbed, as did 25 % of the contact animals. Most (84 %) unvaccinated birds showed viremia 3 d. p. i., but virus was only detected in 14 % of the rE vaccinated birds. WNV-RNA was detected in feathers and swabs from sham-immunized partridges from 3 to 7 d. p. i., mainly in birds that succumbed to the infection, but not in rE vaccinated birds. Thus, rE vaccination fully protected partridges against WND and reduced the risk of virus spread. This work was supported by grants FAU 2008 - 00006 and RTA 2011 - 00036 from the Instituto Nacional de Investigación y Tecnología Agraria y Alimentaria (INIA) and by the Network of Animal Disease Infectiology and Research-European Union (NADIR-EU- 228394).

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al XII Congreso Nacional de Virología de la Sociedad Española de Virología (SEV), celebrado en Burgos del 9 al 12 de junio de 2013. [...] et al. West Nile virus (WNV), a neurovirulent Flavivirus, is {{maintained}} in nature in an enzootic transmission cycle between avian hosts and mosquito vectors, although the virus occasionally infects other vertebrates, including humans, {{in which it}} may result fatal. In Europe the virus has been present for decades but, recently, the number, frequency and severity of outbreaks have increased dramatically. To date, no licensed vaccines against WNV infection are available for bird usage. Although the cost-effectiveness of generalized vaccination programs is uncertain, the availability of WNV vaccines would certainly benefit specific populations, including birds grown for restocking, hunting activities, or alimentary purposes, and those confined to wildlife reservations, zoos, or other <b>recreation</b> <b>installations.</b> Here, we have tested the protective capability of WNV enveloped recombinant (rE) protein in red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa), a gallinaceous bird widely distributed in South and Western Europe and intensively breed for hunting purposes. Partridges were intramuscularly immunized three times at 2 -weeks interval with 10 mg/bird of partially purified rE protein plus adjuvant. An additional control group was sham-immunized before challenge. Except for 5 birds that were non-challenged and housed as contact controls, all birds were subcutaneously infected with 107 PFU of the highly neurovirulent NY 99 WNV strain at our BSL- 3 facilities. Oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs and feather pulp samples were collected daily up to 14 days post-infection, d. p. i. Birds were bled one week before the first immunization and at several time points during vaccination and after infection. While none of the sham-immunized birds showed anti-WNV Ab, all rE-vaccinated birds presented specific Ab after two immunizations, {{and most of them}} had nAb before challenge. Accordingly, none of the rE vaccinated partridges died, while 33. 3...|$|R
2500|$|Christo and Jeanne-Claude {{announced}} plans [...] {{for a future}} project, titled Over The River, to be constructed on the Arkansas River between Salida, Colorado and Cañon City, Colorado on the eastern slope of the Rocky mountains. [...] This scenic area is known as Bighorn Sheep Canyon, and is west of the well-known Royal Gorge. Plans for the project call for horizontally suspending [...] of reflective, translucent fabric panels high above the water, on steel cables anchored into the river's banks. Project plans call for its installation for two weeks {{during the summer of}} 2015, at the earliest, and for the river to remain open to <b>recreation</b> during the <b>installation.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Shoal Site is {{situated}} on 2, 560 acres of withdrawn federal lands {{located within the}} north-central portion of the Sand Springs Range in Churchill County, Nevada. The town of Fallon is the largest populated area {{in the region and}} is about 30 miles northwest of the site. The region around the Shoal Site is sparsely populated; military <b>installations,</b> <b>recreation,</b> ranching, and mining provide the dominant commercial interests. The Project Shoal underground nuclear test was part of the Vela Uniform program sponsored jointly by the U. S Department of Defense and U. S. Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), a predecessor agency of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). Vela Uniform was a research and development program directed toward locating, detecting, and identifying underground detonations. The objective of Project Shoal was to detonate a nuclear device underground in an active seismic area to improve the United States' ability to detect, identify, and locate underground nuclear detonations...|$|R

General Idea Editions: 1967-1995 was featured at the Centro Andaluz de Arte Contemporáneo, Seville, Spain from 30 January - 1 April 2007 http://www.caac.es, and included a <b>recreation</b> of the <b>installations</b> Magic Bullet and Magic Carpet, {{as well as}} the major installation Fin de Siècle. Before that Editions was exhibited at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, the Munich Kunstverein, Kunstwerke (Berlin), and the Kunsthalle in Zurich, Switzerland. General Idea has been featured in the Paris, Sydney, São Paulo and Venice Biennales, as well as at Documenta 8 in Kassel, Germany. Their work continues to be exhibited in group and solo shows worldwide. Recent career retrospectives include Haute Couture at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la ville de Paris, and subsequently toured to the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2010-2011. They had their first Latin American museum show/retrospective, General Idea: Tiempo Partido at Museo Jumex, Mexico City and MALBA, Buenos Aires, in 2016-2017. They {{continue to}} have solo exhibitions at Esther Schipper Gallery (Berlin), and are slated to have their first show with Mitchell-Innes and Nash in late 2017.|$|R
