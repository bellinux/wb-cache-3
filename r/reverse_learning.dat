5000|$|<b>Reverse</b> <b>learning</b> is a neurobiological {{theory of}} dreams. In 1983, {{in a paper}} {{published}} in the science journal Nature, Crick and Mitchison's <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> model likened the process of dreaming to a computer {{in that it was}} [...] "off-line" [...] during dreaming or the REM phase of sleep. During this phase, the brain sifts through information gathered throughout the day and throws out all unwanted material. According to the model, we dream in order to forget and this involves a process of 'reverse learning' or 'unlearning'. <b>Reverse</b> <b>learning</b> eliminates unwanted modes of neural network interaction acquired in the adult mammal's learning and also in the process of fetal brain growth; therefore, {{there is a possibility that}} abnormalities of <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> in the fetal brain might explain some aspects of the autistic syndromes or other neurodevelopmental disorders.|$|E

The only difference compared with classical Ethernet is that <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> is disabled for participating bridge backbone media access control (B-MAC) addresses and is replaced with an ingress check and discard (when the frame arrives on an incoming interface from an unexpected source). Learning is however implemented {{at the edges of}} the SPBM multicast tree to learn the B-MAC to MAC address relationship for correct individual frame encapsulation in the reverse direction (as packets arrive over the Interface).|$|E

40|$|Sprague Dawley rats were {{submitted}} to bilateral ventral hippocampus lesions 7 days after birth. This {{corresponds to the}} Lipska and Weinberger`s procedure for modeling schizophrenia. The aim of the present work was to test the learning capacity of such rats with an associative Pavlovian and an instrumental learning paradigm, both methods using reward outcome (food, sucrose or polycose). The associative paradigm comprised also a second <b>learning</b> test with <b>reversed</b> <b>learning</b> contingencies. The instrumental conditioning comprised an extinction test under outcome devaluation conditions. Neonatally lesioned rats, once adults (over 60 days of age), showed a conditioning deficit in the associative paradigm {{but not in the}} instrumental one. Lesioned rats remained able to adapt as readily as controls to the <b>reversed</b> <b>learning</b> contingency and were as sensitive as controls to the devaluation of outcome. Such observations indicate that the active access (instrumental learning) to a reward could have compensated for the deficit observed under the ""passive"" stimulus-reward associative learning condition. This feature is compared to the memory management impairments observed in clinical patients. (c) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} deficit following {{exposure to}} inescapable shock has been termed "learned helplessness. " This experiment was designed (a) {{to determine whether}} learned helplessness following an inescapable footshock induction procedure extends to 48 hours, and (b) {{to test the hypothesis}} that electroconvulsive shock (ECS) <b>reverses</b> <b>learned</b> helplessness in rats. Subjects were tested for helplessness in a bar-press shock-escape task. Results indicated that helplessness was not present 48 hours after exposure to inescapable shock. A slight indication of helplessness was observed in the first 10 trials of the 60 -trial task. In addition, ECS was shown to enhance performance in the test task; however, this facilitation effect was seen only in control animals that were not previously exposed to inescapable footshock...|$|R
5000|$|Until {{recently}} CWS {{was considered}} extremely rare {{and it is}} now recognized slightly more often as an acute phase of focal brain damage. [...] While CWS patients do not suffer from any serious effects, dreaming is believed to provide some relatively important functions {{to the health of the}} human mind. It is hypothesized that a <b>Reverse</b> <b>learning</b> mechanism occurs while dreaming that facilitate the unlearning of unfavorable pathways to the organism. Complete failure of such as system has been postulated to lead to a state of almost perpetual obsession coupled with hallucinatory associations. [...] In addition it has been postulated that dreams account for emotional preservation, with the emotions one feels during nightmares and joyful dreams solidifying and checking the successful ability to express them. [...] Lastly Freudian Dream Content Analysis, although lacking in credibility in the modern scientific community, once held that dreams hold the key to understanding and emancipating the subconscious.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the visual}} {{area of the}} cortex, {{according}} to the model, the impulses call up largely at random a series of images (=activation). The dreamers sleeping consciousness automatically tries to integrate these images into {{a more or less}} coherent story, while, for example, linking them with fragments of memory from the past (=synthesis). (Similar mechanisms involving the PGO impulses have been incorporated into other dream models, namely Francis Crick and Graeme Mitchisons <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> theory and Michael Jouvets endogenous learning hypothesis.) The activation-synthesis hypothesis, although based on neurological data more advanced than was ever available to Freud, is reminiscent of Freuds psychoanalytic model in that the initial input to the process is primitive and chaotic, onto which some order in imposed by a cognitively more advanced process. But as for the psychological interpretation of dreams the authors of the activation-synthesis hypothesis are outspokenly anti-Freudian, in that in their model the initial input to the dreaming process (the PGO-impulses) are devoid of any depth-psychology significance, Oedipal or whatever. (If the dream acquires any significance relating to the dreamers personality. history, and present circumstances, this occurs {{in the manner in which}} the more or less randomly evoked images are integrated into a story during the synthesis stage, analogous to what a subject may [...] "see" [...] in the random ink-blots of a Rorschach test.) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{behavioural}} experiments, {{motivation to}} learn {{can be achieved}} using food rewards as positive reinforcement in food-restricted animals. Previous studies reduce animal weights to 80 - 90 % of free-feeding body weight as the criterion for food restriction. However, effects of different degrees of food restriction on task performance have not been assessed. We compared learning task performance in mice food-restricted to 80 or 90 % body weight (BW). We used adult wildtype (WT; C 57 Bl/ 6 j) and knockout (ephrin-A 2 ⁻/⁻) mice, previously shown to have a <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> deficit. Mice were trained in a two-choice visual discrimination task with food reward as positive reinforcement. When mice reached criterion for one visual stimulus (80 % correct in three consecutive 10 trial sets) they began the <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> phase, where the rewarded stimulus was switched to the previously incorrect stimulus. For the initial learning and reverse phase of the task, mice at 90 %BW took almost twice as many trials to reach criterion as mice at 80 %BW. Furthermore, WT 80 and 90 %BW groups significantly differed in percentage correct responses and learning strategy in the <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> phase, whereas no differences between weight restriction groups were observed in ephrin-A 2 ⁻/⁻ mice. Most importantly, genotype-specific differences in <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> strategy were only detected in the 80 %BW groups. Our results indicate that increased food restriction not only results in better performance and a shorter training period, but may also be necessary for revealing behavioural differences between experimental groups. This has important ethical and animal welfare implications when deciding extent of diet restriction in behavioural studies...|$|E

40|$|Motor {{learning}} in the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and eyeblink conditioning use similar neural circuitry, and they may use similar cellular plasticity mechanisms. Classically conditioned eyeblink responses undergo extinction after prolonged exposure to the conditioned stimulus {{in the absence of}} the unconditioned stimulus. We investigated the possibility that a process similar to extinction may <b>reverse</b> <b>learned</b> changes in the VOR. We induced a learned alteration of the VOR response in rhesus monkeys using magnifying or miniaturizing goggles, which caused head movements to be accompanied by visual image motion. After learning, head movements in the absence of visual stimulation caused a loss of the learned eye movement response. When the learned gain was low, this reversal of learning occurred only when head movements were delivered, and not when the head was held stationary in the absence of visual input, suggesting that this reversal is mediated by an active, extinction-like process...|$|R

We did not observe a significant rescue effect with ISRIB treatment on spatial learning and memory as assessed in the Morris water maze in J 20 mice. We also did not observe a significant enhancement of spatial learning or memory in nontransgenic mice with ISRIB treatment, although a trend emerged for memory enhancement in one cohort of mice. Future preclinical studies with ISRIB would benefit from additional robust markers of target engagement in the brain...|$|E

Experiment 2 replicated the results observed in Experiment 1 in two go/no-goconcurrent discriminations. These results indicate that both afacilitation in the partial condition and a retardation in the wholecondition make significant contribution to the partial reversalversus whole reversal advantage effect, and that stimulusstimulusassociations between the discriminative stimuli thatsignal either reward, or nonreward, in the two tasks are not formedafter criterion training...|$|R

This proposal apparently passed unnoticed in the neuroscientific community, and subsequent experimentation was conceived independently of these early suggestions.|$|R
40|$|Human {{faces are}} {{approximately}} bilaterally symmetric. We study {{the ability to}} generalize to novel views of human faces focusing {{on the role of}} that symmetry. Our hypothesis is that the ability to identify mirror symmetric images is used for viewpoint generalization by approximating the symmetric view of a learned view by its mirror symmetric image. Two psychophysical experiments are performed using a same/different paradigm. Experiment 1 shows that generalization to the symmetric view is better than generalization to otherwise different views. If the symmetric view is replaced by the mirror <b>reversed</b> <b>learning</b> view, performance further increases. Experiment 2 shows that the match between the learned view and the testing image is performed directly on the level of the images. Performance drops significantly if the symmetry between the intensity patterns of learning and testing view is disturbed by an asymmetric illumination, although the symmetry between the spatial arrangement of high-level features is retained. We show that a simple image-based model can explain important aspects of the data and we show how this model can be extended towards a general algorithm for image comparison. Experimental results are discussed in terms of their relation to existing approaches to object recognition. 1...|$|R

Humans store information in the neurons akin to the storage of computer on silicon chips. For this similarity, the ability of computer is called the artificial intelligence.

40|$|Depression, {{a complex}} mood disorder, {{displays}} high comorbidity with anxiety and cognitive disorders. To establish {{the extent of}} inter-dependence between these behavioral domains, we here undertook a systematic analysis to establish interactions between mood (assessed with the forced-swimming [FST] and sucrose consumption tests [SCT]), anxiety (elevated-plus maze [EPM] and novelty suppressed feeding [NSF] tests) and cognition (spatial memory and behavioral flexibility tests) in rats exposed to unpredictable chronic-mild-stress (uCMS). Expectedly, uCMS induced depressive-like behavior, a hyperanxious phenotype and cognitive impairment; {{with the exception of}} the measure of anxiety in the EPM, these effects were attenuated by antidepressants (imipramine, fluoxetine). Measures of mood by the FST and SCT were strongly correlated, whereas no significant correlations were found between the different measures of anxiety (EPM and NSF); likewise, measures of cognition by spatial memory and behavioral flexibility tests were poorly correlated. Inter-domain analysis revealed significant correlations between mood (FST and SCT) and anxiety-like behavior (NSF, but not EPM). Furthermore, significant correlations were found between cognitive performance (<b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> task) and mood (FST and SCT) and anxiety-like behavior (NSF). These results demonstrate interactions between different behavioral domains that crosscut the disciplines of psychiatry and neurology...|$|E
40|$|We analyze {{interactions}} {{among members of}} rural communities in Ghana and agriculture development specialists. We find that these participants in the knowledge transfer process are separated by deep knowledge boundaries, {{as well as by}} diverging worldviews (one centered on community relations, the other on market relationships). In this context, knowledge transfer is enabled through ritualized interactions and in particular by the use of two types of ritualization strategies: marking strategies (visiting dignitaries and events, praying, gift-giving) and recurring strategies (performing, fabletelling, affirming community values). These findings show that ritualization – understood as a way of acting that distinguishes particular situations from other, usually more mundane, activities – allows encounters between opposing orders and thus enables knowledge transfer. We suggest that this is the case because ritualization speaks to people’s aspirations to change; it is morally redemptive; and it bridges across groups. Ritualized interactions facilitate knowledge transfer by creating a context for learning during mundane interactions, by fostering mechanisms for peer-learning and teaching and by triggering <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> on behalf of knowledge workers from rural communities. Our study contributes to the literature on organizational rituals, learning in strong culture contexts, and economic sociology...|$|E
40|$|Tree shrews, {{a species}} phylogenetically close to primates, are {{regarded}} as a suitable and naturalistic animal model for depression studies. However, psychological symptoms that are essential for depression diagnosis and treatment, such as helplessness and social withdrawal, have not been studied in this model. Therefore, in this study, we first investigated learned helplessness, social interaction and sucrose preference induced by two chronic stress paradigms: uncontrollable foot shocks (1 -week foot shocks) and multiple unpredictable stimuli (1 -week foot shocks and 3 -week unpredictable stressors) in tree shrews. Our results showed that uncontrollable foot shocks could only induce learned helplessness in animals; whereas animals treated with multiple unpredictable stimuli exhibited more depression-like behaviors including social withdrawal, anhedonia and learned helplessness. These findings suggested that multiple unpredictable stimuli could effectively induce various depression-like behaviors in tree shrews. More importantly, we compared the antidepressant effects of fluoxetine and carbetocin, a long-acting oxytocin analog, on specific depression-like behaviors. Our present data displayed that, compared with fluoxetine, carbetocin was also effective in <b>reversing</b> <b>learned</b> helplessness, elevating sucrose preference and improving social interaction behaviors in depression-like animals. Therefore, carbetocin might be a potential antidepressant with applications in humans. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Background Lead (Pb 2 +) is a neurotoxin {{substance}} {{that has been}} known for its adverse effects on central nervous system and memory. Previous studies reported the potential effect of vitamin E as a memory enhancer. Objectives The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess the protective effects of vitamin E against Pb-induced amnesia. Materials and Methods Forty-eight male Wistar rats (200 - 250 g) were divided equally into the saline, Pb, Pb + vitamin E, and vitamin E alone groups. To induce Pb toxicity, rats received water that contained 0. 2 % Pb instead of regular water for 1 month. Rats pretreated, treated or post treated with vitamin E (150 mg/kg) for 2 months. Passive avoidance learning was assessed using Shuttle-Box after two months. Retention was tested 24 and 48 hours after training.

40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} evaluates the {{protective}} role of quercetin against sodium fluoride (NaF) induced neurotoxicity in developing rat brain using biochemical, behavioural and histopathological parameters. Timed pregnant Wistar rats {{were chosen for}} the study and they were distributed into three groups (group 1 : control, group 2 : fluoride and group 3 : fluoride- quercetin). The study duration is for 53 days (i. e. Gestational and post gestational period), where {{in the control group}} received normal tap water; Fluoride group received 20 ppm fluoride and the third group received both 20 ppm of Fluoride and 20 mg of quercetin through oral gavage. Behavioural studies were done using postnatal pups of 21 and 30 days age. The brains of postnatal pups of 14, 21 and 30 days age were collected and used for biochemical and histopathological analysis. The present study indicates the reversal of NaF induced alterations, such as decreased body and brain weights, increased lipid peroxidation, epinephrine levels as well as decreased superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, acetylcholine and norepinephrine levels. Quercetin administration has <b>reversed</b> <b>learning</b> inability and morphological changes in neuron structure. Thus, quercetin exerts neuroprotective property in developing rat brain by ameliorating the NaF induced oxidative stress, alterations in behavioural, neurotransmitters and histopathological alterations...|$|R

Here we investigated the effect of aqueous extract of Origanum aves, stems and flowers) on spatial learning. Methods: After scientific identification, the leaves were used for extraction. 35 adult NMRI male rats weighing 0 - 350 gr were utilized in 5 groups. Control group (no injection), the second group (saline injected), the extracts h different doses (150, 300, 450) mg/kg were injected intraperitoneally to experimental animals. All animals re trained for a spatial learning task using T-maze and were then trained subsequently daily based on standard thod. Results: Statistic analysis ANOVA showed that Origanum aqueous extract significantly decreased the number learning and error in simple and <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> (p< 0. 05) and it had no significant effect on delay time in both e of learning. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the effect of Origanum extract on learning can be due to its antioxidant d presence of anti acetylcholine estrase compounds such as ursolic acid...|$|E
40|$|Imbalances in the {{corticosteroid}} milieu {{have been}} implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. Prefrontal cortex (PFC) dysfunction is also a hallmark of these conditions, causing impairments in executive functions such as behavioral flexibility and working memory. Recent {{studies have suggested that}} the PFC might be influenced by corticosteroids released during stress. To test this possibility, we assessed spatial working memory and behavioral flexibility in rats submitted to chronic adrenalectomy or treatment with corticosterone (25 mg/kg) or the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (300 �g/kg); the behavioral analysis was complemented by stereological evaluation of the PFC (prelimbic, infralimbic, and anterior cingulate regions), the adjacent retrosplenial and motor cortices, and the hippocampal formation. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in a pronounced impairment in working memory and behavioral flexibility, effects that correlated with neuronal loss and atrophy of layer II of the infralimbic, prelimbic, and cingulate cortices. Exposure to corticosterone produced milder impairments in behavioral flexibility, but not in working memory, and reduced the volume of layer II of all prefrontal areas. Interestingly, adrenalectomy-induced deleterious effects only became apparent on the <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> task and were not associated with structural alterations in the PFC. None of the experimental procedures influenced the morphology of retrosplenial or motor cortices, but stereological measurements confirmed previously observed effects of corticosteroids on hippocampal structure. Our results describe, for the first time, that imbalances in the corticosteroid environment can induce degeneration of specific layers of the PFC; these changes appear to be the morphological correlate of corticosteroid-induce...|$|E
40|$|Our {{previous}} analyses {{showed that}} allopregnanolone (APα) significantly increased proliferation of rodent and human neural progenitor cells in vitro. In this study, we investigated {{the efficacy of}} APα to promote neurogenesis in the hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ), to <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> and memory deficits in 3 -month-old male triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's (3 xTgAD) and the correlation between APα-induced neural progenitor cell survival and memory function in 3 xTgAD mice. Neural progenitor cell proliferation was determined by unbiased stereological analysis of BrdU incorporation and survival determined by FACS for BrdU+ cells. Learning and memory function was assessed using the hippocampal-dependent trace eye-blink conditioning paradigm. At 3 months, basal level of BrdU+ cells in the SGZ of 3 xTgAD mice was significantly lower relative to non-Tg mice, {{despite the lack of}} evident AD pathology. APα significantly increased, in a dose-dependent manner, BrdU+ cells in SGZ in 3 xTgAD mice and restored SGZ proliferation to normal magnitude. As with the deficit in proliferation, 3 xTgAD mice exhibited deficits in learning and memory. APα reversed the cognitive deficits to restore learning and memory performance to the level of normal non-Tg mice. In 3 xTgAD mice, APα-induced survival of neural progenitors was significantly correlated with APα-induced memory performance. These findings suggest that early neurogenic deficits, which were evident before immunodetectable Aβ, may contribute to the cognitive phenotype of AD, and that APα could serve as a regenerative therapeutic to prevent or delay neurogenic and cognitive deficits associated with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease...|$|E

There is little knowledge on the cognitive function of B 3 C while B 7 C appeared to <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> and memory impairments. In this study, {{for the first}} time, we evaluated the anti-amnesic effects of B 3 C and B 7 C on learning and memory deficits induced by scopolamine using both Morris water maze and novel object recognition tasks in mice. Under the same experimental condition, the anti-amnesic effect of tacrine was also compared. Briefly, in both tasks, scopolamine (0. 1 - 0. 6 mg/kg, ip) dose-dependently impaired learning and memory functions. B 3 C (1. 5 - 2. 5 μmol/kg), B 7 C (0. 4 - 0. 6 μmol/kg) or tacrine (8 - 12 μmol/kg), each administered ip, dose-dependently mitigated scopolamine-induced learning and memory impairments in both tasks. Our present results show, for the first time, that B 3 C and B 7 C reverse cognitive impairment resulted from scopolamine in both water maze and object recognition tasks; and under the same condition, the relative potency of B 3 C and B 7 C to improve cognitive capacity was 5 - 20 folds over that of tacrine.

40|$|Bees {{navigate}} {{in complex}} environments using visual, olfactory and mechano-sensorial cues. In the lowest {{region of the}} atmosphere, the wind environment can be highly unsteady and bees employ fine motor-skills to enhance flight control. Recent work reveals sophisticated multi-modal processing of visual and olfactory channels by the bee brain to enhance foraging efficiency, but it currently remains unclear whether wind-induced mechano-sensory inputs are also integrated with visual information to facilitate decision making. Individual honeybees were trained in a linear flight arena with appetitive-Aversive differential conditioning to use a context-setting cue of 3 m s- 1 cross-wind direction to enable decisions about either a &# 039;blue&# 039; or &# 039;yellow&# 039; star stimulus being the correct alternative. Colour stimuli properties were mapped in bee-specific opponent-colour spaces to validate saliency, and to thus enable rapid <b>reverse</b> <b>learning.</b> Bees were able to integrate mechano-sensory and visual information to facilitate decisions that were significantly different to chance expectation after 35 learning trials. An independent group of bees were trained to find a single rewarding colour that was unrelated to the wind direction. In these trials, wind was not used as a context-setting cue and served only as a potential distracter in identifying the relevant rewarding visual stimuli. Comparison between respective groups shows that bees can learn to integrate visual and mechano-sensory information in a non-elemental fashion, revealing an unsuspected level of sensory processing in honeybees, and adding to the growing body of knowledge on the capacity of insect brains to use multi-modal sensory inputs in mediating foraging behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Humanin (HN, MAPRGFSCLLLLTSEIDLPVKRRA) is a neuroprotective 24 -mer peptide {{discovered}} in 2001. HN {{was found to}} abolish in vitro the death of neuronal cells induced by mutations related to the familial form of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{as well as by}} other causes leading to AD development. Later, HN was found to exert a broader in vitro cytoprotective action. In vivo HN and its active derivatives were found to <b>reverse</b> <b>learning</b> and memory impairment that was experimentally induced in suitable mice or rat models. The biological activity of HN seems to be strongly related to its primary structure. For example, substitution of Ser 14 by Gly leads to the peptide HNG (HN[Gly 14]), which has a 103 -fold higher activity in comparison to HN, whereas the derivative AGA-(C 8 R) HNG 17 seems to be 106 -fold more potent. Until now, the most potent derivative of HN is Colivelin, which is 108 -fold more active than HN. The exact mechanism through which HN exerts its biological action remains unclear. According to biological studies reported in the literature, HN seems to be produced in vivo, secreted through the endoplasmatic reticulum and Golgi secretary pathway and act outside of the cell, through putative cell surface receptors. On the other hand, HN may also exert its action inside the cell, interfering with apoptotic proteins and thus suppressing cell apoptosis. In the frames of the present work the following tasks were accomplished: 1. Synthesis of i) HN, ii) known from the literature, biologically active derivatives of HN and, iii) new derivatives of HN with potentially high biological activity. Some of the above synthetic peptides were used by collaborating groups in in vivo behavioral studies and in structural studies. 2. Application of certain synthetic derivatives of HN, labeled with the radioisotope 125 I, to preliminary biological in vitro cell-binding studies and in vivo biodistribution studies. 3. Synthesis of HN as well as of possibly antigenic HN-derivatives and, consequently, development and evaluation of the antibodies raised against them. Utlimate goal is to use these antibodies in the immunodetection of HN in biological samples. More specifically, in the present study the 24 -mer peptide humanin and twelve different peptide derivatives of HN were synthesized. The HN-derivatives selected for synthesis have substitutions, insertions or deletions of aminoacids at several positions of the parental peptide HN. The peptides were synthesized following the Fmoc/t-Bu solid phase strategy. The synthetic peptides were purified with semi-preparative RP-HPLC, characterized with analytical RP-HPLC and identified with ESI-MS. The final synthetic products were of high purity. During synthesis of all the above peptides, slow deprotection of the Nα-protecting group was observed at the region Arg 4 -Leu 10. The synthetic derivatives Tyr-des-Leu-AGA(C 8 R) -HNG 17 (Υ-ΗΝ 5) and Tyr-des-Leu-Colivelin (Y-HN 8), which contain a Tyr residue at their N-terminus, were radiolabeled with 125 I (Czech Academy of Sciences) and were used in preliminary in vitro cell-binding studies using the cell lines neuro- 2 A, SY 5 Y, HT 22, U 87 Mg as well as cell membranes isolated from murine brain and stomach tissues. According to preliminary results, low binding of 125 Ι-Υ-ΗΝ 8 onto membranes isolated from the stomach tissues was observed. The radiolabeled derivatives 125 Ι-Υ-ΗΝ 5 and 125 Ι-Υ-ΗΝ 8 were also used in preliminary in vivo biodistribution studies in Swiss albino mice (Radiopharmaceutical Chemistry Laboratory, NCSR “Demokritos”). According to preliminary results, it is quite interesting that radioactivity was accumulated in the stomach 2 h after intravenous administration of the radiolabeled peptides. Moreover, in the present study, different antibodies for HN were developed and evaluated, using different immunogens. In particular, New Zealand white rabbits were immunized against: - synthetic HN, non conjugated to an immunogenic carrier-protein [HN], - synthetic HN conjugated to the immunogenic carrier-protein KLH using the glutaraldehyde method [HN/KLH(1) ], - synthetic HN conjugated to KLH using (4 -N-maleimidomethyl) cyclohexane- 1 -carboxylic- 3 -sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidoester (sulfo-SMCC) [HN/KLH(2) ], - a synthetic C-terminal peptide derivative of HN (consisting of Asp 17 -Ala 24 and having an additional Lys residue at the N-terminal and whose Lys 21 is Nε-acetylated) conjugated to KLH using the glutaraldehyde method [C 1 -HN/KLH], - a synthetic C-terminal peptide derivative of HN (consisting of Asp 17 -Ala 24 and having an additional Lys residue at the N-terminal) conjugated to KLH using the glutaraldehyde method [C 2 -HN/KLH], - a synthetic Ν-terminal derivative of HN (consisting by Met 1 -Ser 7 and having aminocaproic acid at its C-terminus) conjugated to KLH using the carbodiimide method [Ν-HN/KLH], - synthetic HN, which has at its N-terminus a “dendrimer” consisting of three Lys residues [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Previously, we {{demonstrated}} that allopregnanolone (APa) promoted proliferation of rodent and human neural progenitor cells in vitro. Further, we {{demonstrated that}} APa promoted neurogenesis in the hippocampal subgranular zone (SGZ) and <b>reversed</b> <b>learning</b> and memory deficits {{in the male}} triple transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer’s (3 xTgAD). In the current study, we determined the efficacy of APa to promote the survival of newly generated neural cells while simultaneously reducing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology in the 3 xTgAD male mouse model. Comparative analyses between three different APa treatment regimens indicated that APa administered 1 /week for 6 months was maximally efficacious for simultaneous promotion of neurogenesis and survival of newly generated cells and reduction of AD pathology. We further investigated the efficacy of APa to impact Ab burden. Treatment was initiated either prior to or post intraneuronal Ab accumulation. Results indicated that APa administered 1 /week for 6 months significantly increased survival of newly generated neurons and simultaneously reduced Ab pathology with greatest efficacy in the pre-pathology treatment group. APa significantly reduced Ab generation in hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala, which was paralleled by decreased expression of Ab-binding-alcohol-dehydrogenase. In addition, APa significantly reduced microglia activation as indicated by reduced expression of OX 42 while increasing CNPase, an oligodendrocyte myelin marker. Mechanistic analyses indicated that pre-pathology treatment with APa increased expression of liver-X-receptor, pregnane-X-receptor, and 3 -hydroxy- 3 methyl-glutaryl-CoA-reductas...|$|R
40|$|Cognitive {{impairment}} {{occurs in}} diabetes mellitus. Glabridin {{as a major}} active flavonoids in Glycyrrhiza glabra (licorice) improves learning and memory in mice. In the present study, we investigated the effect of chronic treatment with glabridin (5, 25 and 50 mg/kg, p. o.) on cognitive function in control and streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats. Animals were divided into untreated control, glabridin-treated control (5, 25 and 50 mg/kg), untreated diabetic and glabridin treated diabetic (5, 25 and 50 mg/kg) groups. Treatments were begun {{at the onset of}} hyperglycemia. Passive avoidance learning (PAL) and memory was assessed 30 days later. Diabetes caused cognition deficits in the PAL and memory paradigm. While oral glabridin administration (25 and 50 mg/kg) improved learning and memory in non-diabetic rats, it <b>reversed</b> <b>learning</b> and memory deficits of diabetic rats. Low dose glabridin (5 mg/kg) did not alter cognitive function in non-diabetic and diabetic groups. Glabridin treatment partially improved the reduced body weight and hyperglycemia of diabetic rats although the differences were not significant. The combination of antioxidant, neuroprotective and anticholinesterase properties of glabridin may all be responsible for the observed effects. These results show that glabridin prevented the deleterious effects of diabetes on learning and memory in rats. Further studies are warranted for clinical use of glabridin in the management of demented diabetic patients...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPerceptual {{learning}} (PL) often shows specificity to {{a trained}} feature. We investigated whether feature specificity {{is related to}} disruption in PL using the texture discrimination task (TDT), which shows learning specificity to background element but not to target element. Learning was disrupted when orientations of background elements were changed in two successive training sessions (interference) {{but not in a}} random order from trial to trial (roving). The presentation of target elements seemed to have <b>reversed</b> effect; <b>learning</b> occurred in two-parts training but not with roving. These results suggest that interference in TDT is feature specific while disruption by roving is not...|$|R
