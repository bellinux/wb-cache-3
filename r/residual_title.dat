40|$|Housing {{affordability}} is a {{major problem}} for Australia and New Zealand. One of the key issues is how best to measure it. The prevailing measure of housing affordability or stress in Australia and most other countries is some variation of a benchmark method whereby some percentage of housing costs is compared to household or personal income. In Australia it is normally taken as 30 % of the 40 th income quintile (the 30 / 40 rule). This paper reports on the application of the residual income or budget standard method as an alternative way of understanding a range of problems relating to housing affordability. The method determines the amount of income left over for housing costs (hence the <b>residual</b> <b>title)</b> after a minimum standard of adequacy has been met by way of other expenditures. The paper outlines in preliminary form the method used in modelling the residual income for a range of household type and for both home purchase and private rental and then illustrates the usefulness of the concept via applications to the Melbourne housing market. While there is some fine-tuning of the method, early findings suggest that for some household types, the 30 / 40 rule overstates their lack of affordability and for others understates it. The findings also help explain how, despite high house prices in Melbourne (median of around A$ 500, 000), these dwellings are still affordable for many households, and why singles and childless couples are becoming large players in the home purchase market while many families are being trapped in private rental...|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} author surveyed all Harvard University Press titles published (in first edition) between 2000 {{and well}} into 2010, making 10 + years of publication, {{in the subject}} areas of Business & Economics, History, Philosophy, Political Science, and Sociology, {{as well as a}} <b>residual</b> of Law <b>titles.</b> A large number of titles were initially removed from the survey because the book title suggested little connection or platform for political ideology. After making these removals, 494 titles remained, and the ideological outlook of each was assessed. The results show that Harvard University Press leans heavily to the left. In fact, over the 10 + years surveyed only eight of the 494 titles, or 2 percent, had an outlook that was conspicuously either classical liberal or conservative. The results are important for debates about whether academic standardsâ€”"Has the candidate published a book with a leading university press?" [...] are themselves ideologically biased.
