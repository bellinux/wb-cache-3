40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the principles of}} performing proper ultrasound examinations of the urinary tract. The following are discussed: preparation of patients, type of optimal apparatus, technique of examination and conditions which its description should fulfill. Urinary track examination in adults and in children constitutes {{an integral part of}} each abdominal examination. Such examinations should be performed with fasting patients or several hours after the last meal, with filled urinary bladder. Apparatus: Ultrasound examinations in children and infants are performed using transducers with the frequency of 5. 0 – 9. 0 MHz and in adults – with the frequency of 2. 0 – 6. 0 MHz. Doppler options are desirable since they improve diagnostic capacity of sonography in terms of differentiation between renal focal lesions. Scanning technique: <b>Renal</b> <b>examinations</b> are performed with the patients in the supine position. The right kidney is examined in the right hypochondriac region using the liver as the ultrasound “window. ” The left kidney is examined in the left hypochondriac region, preferably in the posterior axillary line. Ultrasound examinations of the upper segment of the ureters are performed after <b>renal</b> <b>examination</b> when the pelvicalyceal system is dilated. A condition necessary for a proper examination of the perivesical portion of the ureter is full urinary bladder. The scans of the urinary bladder are performed in transverse, longitudinal and oblique planes when the bladder is filled. Description of the examination: The description should include patient’s personal details, details of the referring unit, of the unit in which the examination is performed, examining physician’s details, type of ultrasound apparatus and transducers as well as the description proper...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Seminal cord varices cause {{degenerative}} {{processes in}} testicles described as “orchidopathia e varicocele”. One of the coefficients of surgical treatment efficacy {{could be an}} increase of the testicle volume after surgical procedure. Material and methods: In 83 patients operated due to left side seminal cord varices the ultrasound examination of scrotum was performed aiming, among others, at the evaluation of both testicles volume. The examination was performed before the surgical procedure {{and then in the}} period of 6 - 8 months after the laparoscopically performed surgical procedure. The ultrasound examination was made by means of sector head (frequency of 7. 5 MHz) and the <b>examination</b> <b>unit</b> B&K Medical 3535. During the examination the patient was in standing position. The testicle volume (in cm 3) was calculated by means of urological measurement module, which was the part of ultrasound <b>examination</b> <b>unit</b> software. Results: In the patients with seminal cord varices a statistically significant increase of the left testicle volume after applied laparoscopical surgery treatment was gained (p< 0. 001). The increase of the left testicle volume was found in 71 of 83 operated patients. Conclusions: 1. The application of the laparoscopic method in the patients with left seminal cord varices causes an increase of the testicle volume on the operated side. 2. The ultrasound evaluation of the testicle volume is safe for the patient and simple for the physician diagnostic method...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: We {{experienced}} two {{esophageal cancer}} patients who developed severe {{acute renal failure}} after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5 -fluorourasil. Presentation of case: After administration of cisplatin, their serum creatinine increased gradually until they required hemodialysis and their renal failure was permanent. In both cases, <b>renal</b> biopsy <b>examination</b> indicated partial recovery of the proximal tubule, but renal function did not recover. After these events, one patient underwent definitive radiotherapy and the other underwent esophagectomy for their esophageal cancers, while continuing dialysis. Both patients are alive without cancer recurrence. Discussion: In these two cases of cisplatin-induced renal failure, <b>renal</b> biopsy <b>examination</b> showed only slight disorder of proximal tubules and tendency to recover. Conclusion: Although cisplatin-related nephrotoxicity is a well-recognized complication, {{there have been few}} reports of renal failure requiring hemodialysis in cancer patients.
