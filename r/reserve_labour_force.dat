40|$|During {{the twentieth}} century, {{the number of}} women in the labour force has risen dramatically. Since World War II the {{increase}} in labour force participation among married women has been particularly noticeable. However the participation of married women has fluctuated at times over the century as a result of national crises such as the World Wars and economic booms and recessions. Two labour market theories have been used to analyse women's labour force participation. The reserve army of labour theory as developed by Marx, is {{based on the idea that}} a flexible and disposable labour force is required by capital for capital accumulation. Although Marx did not specifically describe women as a <b>reserve</b> <b>labour</b> <b>force,</b> recent theorists have applied his theory to women in wage labour. The dual labour market theory likewise was not developed with women in mind but has since been used to analyse their labour force participation. It has been shown that women as a group of workers display similar characteristics to those attributed to secondary sector workers in the dual labour market, such as low wages and insecure, unstable positions and poor working conditions. Neither of the labour market theories questions why women as a group of workers comprise part of a reserve army of labour or the secondary sector of the labour market. In particular, these theories take no account of women's domestic responsibilities which considerably limit women's labour force participation. Feminist theorists however maintain that a theory of women's wage labour must include women's domestic role. This thesis examines how the labour market theories have been used to analyse women's participation in the labour market and reviews feminist theories which have linked women's domestic role with their position in the labour force. Employers hold a key position in the entry of women to the labour market. A survey of employers in the Manufacturing, Insurance, Finance and Business Services industrial groups in Palmerston North was undertaken to investigate employers' perceptions of the place of women in the labour force. Evidence from the study indicates that employers prefer women in positions which have traditionally been "women's work" and are reluctant to promote women because employers think the women's domestic responsibilities will preclude them from adequately carrying out their labour market obligations. In conclusion, it is apparent that employers do not perceive women as being career oriented because they believe women's domestic responsibilities will take priority in their lives. This belief effectively limits women's participation in the labour force and contributes to the continuation of sexual divisions in the labour market...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the relationship between the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> development of Indian reserves in Canada and their physical accessibility to off-reserve communities designated as service centres. The second goal is {{to examine the relationship between}} the traditional cultural affiliation of <b>reserves</b> and their <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> development. The diffusionist and dependency development paradigms are considered to place the role of accessibility and cultural affiliation into the context of reserve development. A review of the literature investigating the influence of physical accessibility upon reserve development follows. The traditional Indian culture areas of Canada are introduced, as are the rationale for investigating the roles of these two factors in reserve development. The reserves were then classified into six samples representing cultural affiliation. These are the Iroquoian, Algonkian, Plains, Mackenzie River, Plateau, and Pacific Coast culture areas. Lastly, two culture areas are examined to gain further insight into the nature of differences amongst reserves falling into the same access category. Levels of education and mother tongues spoken in the Algonkian and Pacific Coast culture areas are compared to this end. In conclusion, the major differences amongst the samples are highlighted in terms of the hypotheses posed in this research. Some further avenues of inquiry are then suggested for future research.

40|$|In {{the restless}} and {{alarming}} {{context of the}} present economic crisis with its manifestations and effects, the labour market at European level confronts itself with a saturation of the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> offer. With all the restrictions imposed by the measures concerning {{the reduction of the}} transfrontier mobility of the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> within the European Union, the liberalization of the movements on the labour market creates real problems to the European governors. We deal with a contradiction (one of many others) at the European level; on the one side, the active concern for the achievement of the fundamental principle of European legislation concerning the free traffic of <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> and, on the other side, the fear that the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> originated in the newly-integrated zones in the space of United Europe will create disequilibriums in the sustained and promoted social systems by extremely protectionist measures of the traditional community states. The encouraging economic laws for the coming out of crisis are, in their turn, in dispute; they either support the creation of jobs as ideal measures for the revival of the labour market marked by the unemployment, or sustain models of financial management by means of which to save and guide the financial markets. Declared by E. U. as “the European Year of the Struggle against Poverty and Social Exclusion”, 2010 represents a serious moment of reference as far as the acceptance without <b>reserve</b> of the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> originated in the Eastern Europe Zone is concerned. This is true because the discretionary approach of the European Constitution for the immigration quota, continues to generate great differences among the European countries that manifest totally different and non-concordant positions. The care towards an eventual “social dumping” transforms into a true and unquestionable policy of social limitation combined with an exacerbate protectionism. The present study proposes an economic-social analysis of the present phenomena, of the solutions, the initiatives and European projects co-financed or in partnership with the aim of diminishing the major effects of the crisis on the labour market. social dumping, the restriction of the <b>labour</b> <b>force,</b> social exclusion...|$|R
40|$|The <b>reserve</b> army of <b>labour</b> is a {{structural}} necessity of capitalism. By constantly keeping {{a part of}} the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> unemployed or under-employed but potentially available for capital to draw on if needed, the <b>reserve</b> army of <b>labour</b> maintains the viability of capital accumulation by inflicting enormous costs on the working class. In the postwar U. S. economy, the <b>reserve</b> army of <b>labour</b> has increased from about 5 - 6 million in the early 1950 s to around 25 - 30 million in the late 2000 s. Average size of the reserve army, as a share of the <b>labour</b> <b>force,</b> was substantially higher in the neoliberal period (1948 - 1980) compared to its size in the regulated period (1948 - 1980).

40|$|The {{governments of}} many {{developed}} economies are confronting {{a number of}} policy issues associated with ageing populations. For example, pension reforms, increasing the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation of older workers and increasing the standard retirement age are various policy reforms suggested by the OECD {{to cope with the}} fiscal strain associated with ageing populations. However, many of the same governments now embracing these reforms had until recent times allowed the early exit of older workers from the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> by various means in periods of excess labour supply, leading to the allegation that these governments had treated older workers as a ‘reserve army of labour’. In this paper panel models for the <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation of males aged 55 - 59 and 60 - 64 years in 12 OECD countries are estimated as a function of social security and labour market variables covering the time period 1967 to 2007. In contrast to previous OECD modelling, allowances are made for both country specific intercept and slope terms in various specifications, thereby allowing the incorporation of unique aspects of each country’s social security system or labour market. In addition, both long run models and also short run models incorporating error correction terms are estimated. The findings suggest that the ‘one size fits all’ policy advocated by the OECD is inadequate to address country specific factors affecting older worker <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation. The recent pension reforms are now out of character with the <b>reserve</b> army of <b>labour</b> explanation and results also imply that governments in many OECD countries will struggle to increase older male <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation through pension policy reform alone, without addressing the important role of the aggregate <b>labour</b> market. <b>Labour</b> <b>force</b> participation, older workers, ageing society, <b>reserve</b> army of <b>labour...</b>|$|R

On the one hand we have witnessed the heroic acts not only of the refugees themselves who moved collectively and refused to queue ‘orderly’ in the immigration lines, but also the magnificent response of citizens in all over Europe who rushed to feed, clothe, accommodate and welcome them. In contrast the overwhelming institutional response by ‘liberal’ states has been, and remains, depressingly illiberal.

They then go on to outline the key features of regional variations in the scope for additional labour-force participation. As labour supply is a dynamic concept, and the utilisation of the <b>labour</b> <b>reserve</b> implies transitions from unemployment and nonemployment to employment, selected information on transitions between labour-market states and on the previous economic circumstances of the unemployed is presented. Some key features of the broad regional geography of those categorised as in employment, but 'on the margins' of the <b>labour</b> <b>reserve,</b> are highlighted also.

40|$|The article {{analyses}} how {{the hidden}} <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> has {{developed in the}} recent past and what role the far-reaching modifications ensuing from the labour market reforms of 2005 (Hartz IV) have played. Estimations published by IAB in 2005 are used as a starting point. On the basis of these estimation equations, the hidden <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> was calculated up to 2007 using topical data. Against expectations, the present updated estimations show an increase in the hidden <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> in spite of the labour market reforms of 2005. The <b>labour</b> <b>reserve</b> increased strongly between 2004 and 2005 mainly among young people (under 25 years of age) and German women. In contrast, the number of elderly persons (over 50 years old) as well as the number of German men who were part of the hidden <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> dropped relatively sharply. This surprising growth in the hidden <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> may be caused by several effects: on the one hand the Hartz IV reforms enforced a principle of 'encouragement plus obligations' and were expected to result in a greater number of persons registering at the employment offices - persons, that is, who were capable of and available for work and had so far neither registered as unemployed nor were gainfully employed. On the other hand {{it is possible that the}} very negative information on Hartz IV spread in the media caused many people not to register. Moreover, as a significant part of the hidden <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participates in employment and training schemes, such people are thus already registered and therefore not affected by Hartz IV. Altogether the updated estimations show that alongside official unemployment there is still a considerable hidden <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> of persons who are willing to work.
