40|$|Sprawling growth {{patterns}} have {{characterized the}} spatial development of {{cities in the}} United States {{since the advent of}} the automobile. Extensive research has shown that low-density, haphazard development (a. k. a. sprawl) causes numerous deleterious impacts on communities. Communities are beginning to recognize the consequences of sprawling development patterns and wish to shift those patterns to more sustainable land-use, economics, ecologies, human settlements, and human relationships. Although efforts at all levels are being made to slow down sprawl, low-density suburbs are built in place of new development or redevelopment near existing infrastructure in central cities. Even in rural Vermont, sprawl threatens the unique village centers surrounded by breathtaking working landscapes that Vermonters cherish and visitors flock to. Burlington, Vermont recognizes that sprawl is degrading the natural landscape. As part of a promulgated vision of sustainability in municipal plans, Burlington accepts their role as a <b>regional</b> <b>growth</b> <b>center.</b> Compact mixed-use development patterns are identified as the type of urban form commensurate with curbing sprawl. Burlington designated certain growth centers within the city and is attempting to increase density in those areas. This thesis explores the types of local land-use tools Burlington is uses to focus development in designated parts of the city, as one aspect of a sustainable growth strategy. The case study reveals that residents oppose higher density projects due to a perceived threat to their pervading quality of life. However, people do not have an innate awareness and understanding of what design elements contribute to the quality of their built environment. Since urban design and architecture determine the quality and character of compact development and compact development is essential to curb sprawl, then good urban design and architecture are critical components in curbing sprawl. In order for higher density projects to gain acceptance, the methods of analysis used for development review need to shift to more qualitative measures based on the type of site design and architectural features that communities prefer. by Noah Terrell Maslan.

TRC 2 NUTS- 2 Region consisting of Diyarbakir and Sanliurfa, two major centers of Southeast Anatolia, is among those which face this problem the most deeply due to get immigration from its own region and migrate to the west region of Turkey. Diyarbakir and Sianirfa identified as <b>regional</b> <b>growth</b> <b>centers</b> at the national level policies in order to keep migration waves within the region. In this study; urbanization and city size distribution in Turkey were examined, and then changes of the rank size distribution of Diyarbak?r region in 1970 - 2010 period were analyzed. Diyarbakir region receives mass migration and unable to keep this migration within the region {{due to the lack of}} employment opportunities and migrate to the metropolitan cities of Turkey. As method of the study, rank size rule was used in order to analyze rank size distribution of Diyarbakir and Sianliurfa. According to results Diyarbakir seems to be primate city and tends to increase this role in the period of 1970 - 2010. In this period, medium-sized cities also tend to grow with the effect of attractive and push factors in the region. According to the rank-size distribution of Sianliurfa, the city center and medium-sized cities have grown up in a polycentric way in this period. In light of findings from the study, investment for regional center and district centers which gets migration should be done and for small and rural settlements measures should be taken to improve the quality of life. In order to create a balanced settlements system and ensure healthy urbanization in the region; social integration, increase in employment and ensuring adequate physical infrastructure policies are crucial for regional centers and medium-sized cities that will serve as sub-central areas...|$|R

The study has three main points: 1) examination of the economic structure and inequality {{at the national level}} and in the Northeastern region according to the Theil index, 2) determination of <b>regional</b> <b>growth</b> centres and satellite towns by using growth pole theory as a conceptual framework and incorporating spatial interaction analysis and 3) analysis of the relationship between <b>regional</b> <b>growth</b> centres and satellite towns with regard to the impact on growth and inequality. The results show that the Northeastern region is definitely the lagging region in the nation, by both gross domestic product (GDP) and gross regional product (GRP) per capita. It was therefore selected for a case study. Spatial analysis identified Nakhon Ratchasima, Khon Kaen, Udon Thani and Ubon Ratchathani as <b>regional</b> <b>growth</b> centres.

The development of <b>regional</b> <b>growth</b> centres has a direct impact on sub-regional economic growth through economic and social relationships: urbanisation, industrial development, per capita growth, the number of higher educational institutes and so on. However, such growth negatively correlates with economic equality among the provinces in a sub-region. The inequality trend is obviously on an upswing. This study suggests that industrial links between <b>regional</b> <b>growth</b> centres and their satellite towns should be improved in order for <b>regional</b> <b>growth</b> centre development to have a consistently desirable effect on both economic growth and equality.
