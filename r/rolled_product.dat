5000|$|Any {{kind of an}} old loft {{served as}} a cigar shop. If there were enough windows, we had {{sufficient}} light for our work; if not, it was apparently no concern of the management.... Cigar shops were always dusty from the tobacco stems and powdered leaves. Benches and work tables were not designed to enable the workmen to adjust bodies and arms comfortably to work surface. Each workman supplied his own cutting board of lignum vitae and knife blade.The tobacco leaf was prepared by strippers who drew the leaves from the heavy stem {{and put them into}} pads of about fifty. The leaves had to be handled carefully to prevent tearing. The craftsmanship of the cigarmaker was shown in his ability to utilize wrappers to the best advantage to shave off the unusable to a hairbreadth, to roll so as to cover holes in the leaf and to use both hands so as to make a perfectly shaped and <b>rolled</b> <b>product.</b> These things a good cigarmaker learned to do more or less mechanically, which left us free to think, talk, listen, or sing. I loved the freedom of that work, for I had earned the mind-freedom that accompanied skill as a craftsman. I was eager to learn from discussion and reading or to pour out my feelings in song.|$|E
40|$|The {{high quality}} {{requirements}} of sheet metal (eg steel, aluminium) {{and the modern}} trends towards computer control of sheet rolling have placed an increasing emphasis on {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics of the flat rolling process. The examination of the thermal behaviour of the rolls and <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> as the latter is deformed in a rolling stand, is integral to an understanding of rolling. The thermal process occurring in the rolling stands affects the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the material, governs the roll cooling requirements, and influences the overall flatness of the <b>rolled</b> <b>product.</b> This thesis is primarily concerned with the prediction of the short-time variation of the temperature field of the rolls and <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> as the latter is deformed in a rolling stand. The effect of an oxide layer, which often exists in hot rolling of steel, on the thermal process has been studied in detail. It is demonstrated that, under normal rolling conditions, the thermal process occurring in rolling can be reduced by perturbation methods to one of heat transfer between three slabs with plane parallel boundary contact. As a result, the reduction in heat loss to the rolls and the increase in temperature of the <b>rolled</b> <b>product</b> due to the insulating effect of the oxide layer can be quantified. The contribution of each heat source term, namely, that arising from the effect of the bulk temperature difference between the roll and <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> frictional heating at the roll/rolled product contact region, and deformation heating in the <b>rolled</b> <b>product</b> within the roll gap, to the overall thermal process is estimated for both hot and cold rolling conditions...|$|E

40|$|Shape {{is a key}} {{characteristic}} {{to determine}} the quality of outgoing flat-rolled products in the steel industry. It is greatly influenced by flatness, a feature to describe how {{the surface of a}} <b>rolled</b> <b>product</b> approaches a plane. Flatness is of the utmost importance in steelmaking, since it is used by most downstream processes and customers for the acceptance or rejection of rolled products. Flatness sensors compute flatness measurements based on comparing the length of several longitudinal fibers of the surface of the product under inspection. Two main different approaches are commonly used. On the one hand, most mechanical sensors measure the tensile stress across the width of the <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> while manufacturing and estimating the fiber lengths from this stress. On the other hand, optical sensors measure the length of the fibers by means of light patterns projected onto the product surface. In this paper, we review the techniques and the main sensors used in the steelmaking industry to measure and quantify flatness defects in steel plates, sheets and strips. Most of these techniques and sensors can be used in other industries involving rolling mills or continuous production lines, such as aluminum, copper and paper, to name a few. Encompassed in the special issue, State-of-the-Art Sensors Technology in Spain 2013, this paper also reviews the most important flatness sensors designed and developed for the steelmaking industry in Spain...|$|E
