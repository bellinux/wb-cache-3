In {{addition}} some effort was dedicated to the development of an improved method of ICPMS Sr determination and preliminary results are also reported. The study of Sr, although being a short-living radionuclide and therefore not important for IRF, is an aspect of special interest due to some contradictory literature findings. Although it has been traditionally considered as matrix <b>release</b> <b>indicator</b> recent experimental work carried out at ITU has shown that Sr dissolves faster than the matrix. In order to clarify this statement a more precise evaluation method is being developed in the frame of this project.

40|$|Transmitter release at {{chemical}} synapses is {{triggered by}} high calcium concentration microprofiles at the presynaptic cytosol. Such microprofiles, {{generated by the}} opening of voltage-dependent calcium channels at the presynaptic plasma membrane, have been defined as calcium concentration microdomains. Using total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy in conjunction with calcium and vesicular <b>release</b> <b>indicator</b> dyes, we have directly visualized the close apposition of calcium concentration microdomains and synaptic release sites at single synaptic terminals from the CNS from rat cerebellar mossy fiber and squid optic lobe. These findings demonstrate the close apposition of calcium entry and release sites and the dynamics of such site locations over time. Kinetic analysis shows that vesicles can be released via two distinct mechanisms: full-fusion and kiss-and-run. Calcium triggers vesicular motion toward the membrane, and the speed of such movement is calcium concentration-dependent. Moreover, the immediately available vesicular pool represents molecularly trapped vesicles that can be located at a larger distance from the plasma membrane than the field illuminated by total internal reflection fluorescent microscopy...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} ethanol {{fumigation}} on the inter-cycle variability of key in-cylinder pressure parameters {{in a modern}} common rail diesel engine have been investigated. Specifically, maximum rate of pressure rise, peak pressure, peak pressure timing and ignition delay were investigated. A new methodology for investigating the start of combustion was also proposed and demonstrated—which is particularly useful with noisy in-cylinder pressure data as it can {{have a significant effect}} on the calculation of an accurate net rate of heat <b>release</b> <b>indicator</b> diagram. Inter-cycle variability has been traditionally investigated using the coefficient of variation. However, deeper insight into engine operation is given by presenting the results as kernel density estimates; hence, allowing investigation of otherwise unnoticed phenomena, including: multi-modal and skewed behaviour. This study has found that operation of a common rail diesel engine with high ethanol substitutions (> 20 % at full load, > 30 % at three quarter load) results in a significant reduction in ignition delay. Further, this study also concluded that if the engine is operated with absolute air to fuel ratios (mole basis) less than 80, the inter-cycle variability is substantially increased compared to normal operation...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to obtain {{microbeads}} of natural polymers such as alginate and chitosan. These microbeads were used as potential carriers for the active ingredients so that in this study the diffusion of various substances from them is analyzed.

In the resulting microbeads was performed absorption of three tracer indicators with different molecular weight (acridine orange, blue dextran, methylene blue). The goal of the experiment is to monitor <b>indicators</b> <b>release</b> kinetics from microbeads. Based on these measurements the layoffs curve should give an answer on the impact of the molecular size of the three indicators on the diffusion rate of microbeads. In order to achieve the slow <b>release</b> of <b>indicators</b> alginate microbeads were coated with chitosan.

40|$|We {{introduce}} r. randomwalk, {{a flexible}} and multi-functional open-source tool for backward and forward analyses of mass movement propagation. r. randomwalk builds on GRASS GIS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System – Geographic Information System), the R software for statistical computing and the programming languages Python and C. Using constrained random walks, mass points are routed from defined release pixels {{of one to}} many mass movements through a digital elevation model until a defined break criterion is reached. Compared to existing tools, the major innovative features of r. randomwalk are (i) multiple break criteria can be combined to compute an impact indicator score; (ii) the uncertainties of break criteria can be included by performing multiple parallel computations with randomized parameter sets, resulting in an impact indicator index in the range 0 – 1; (iii) built-in functions for validation and visualization of the results are provided; (iv) observed landslides can be back analysed to derive the density distribution of the observed angles of reach. This distribution can be employed to compute impact probabilities for each pixel. Further, impact indicator scores and probabilities can be combined with <b>release</b> <b>indicator</b> scores or probabilities, and with exposure indicator scores. We demonstrate the key functionalities of r. randomwalk for (i) a single event, the Acheron rock avalanche in New Zealand; (ii) landslides in a 61. 5 km 2 study area in the Kao Ping Watershed, Taiwan; and (iii) lake outburst floods in a 2106 km 2 area in the Gunt Valley, Tajikistan...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of the dissertation, a novel concept for the {{comparative}} risk evaluation of environmental effects of chemicals is presented. Starting with an overview of strenghts and weaknesses of published methods, the use of the five indicators release, spatiotemporal range, bioaccumulation, biological activity and uncertainty is proposed. The five indicators taken together constitute an ecotoxicological risk profile for each of the evaluated substances, which enables manufacturers, users and other interested groups to compare substances with respect to the risk of damaging the environment by their use. The second part of the dissertation shows the application of the concept to the five antifouling biocides tributyltin, Irgarol 1051, Sea-Nine 211 and pyrithione in commercial shipping. Since the high biological activity is a desired property of the substances, and therefore leaves little room for optimization from the environmental viewpoint, the other four indicators gain special importance in this case. The comparative evaluation of the <b>release</b> <b>indicator</b> only resulted in small differences between the substances. A comparison of the estimated copper input from antifouling coatings of the commercial world fleet with todays total copper inputs into the oceans yielded a fraction of 5 % for the contribution of antifouling coatings. For the evaluation of the spatiotemporal range of the substances, a newly developed Level III fate model is presented. The influence of the variability of biocide-specific input parameters on model results, which was investigated by Monte Carlo simulations, is discussed, and the model results are compared with concentrations of tributyltin and copper that have been measured in the environment. Finally, an integration of the ecotoxicological risk profiles into a newly presented concept for a sustainable product design of chemicals is proposed. [URL]...|$|E

Areas under the time-melatonin concentration curve varied in proportion to the different melatonin doses ingested, and the 0. 1 - and 0. 3 -mg doses generated peak serum melatonin levels that were within the normal range of nocturnal melatonin levels in untreated people. All melatonin doses tested significantly increased sleep duration, as well as self-reported sleepiness and fatigue, relative to placebo. Moreover, all of the doses significantly decreased sleep-onset latency, oral temperature, and the number of correct responses on the Wilkinson auditory vigilance task. These data indicate that orally administered melatonin can be a highly potent hypnotic agent; they also suggest that the physiological increase in serum melatonin levels, which occurs around 2100 h daily, may constitute a signal initiating normal sleep onset...|$|R

While bacterial concentrations were evenly released into runoff and infiltration, the surface slope controlled the partitioning of total released bacterial loads.
