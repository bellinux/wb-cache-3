On firing it was pushed backwards by a cordite firing pistol and a long steel ram, entering the water tail-first. A trip-wire between the torpedo and the <b>ram</b> <b>head</b> would start the torpedo motors once pulled taut during release. The CMB would then turn hard over {{and get out of}} its path. There is no record of a CMB ever being hit by its own torpedo, but in one instance the firing pistol was triggered prematurely and the crew had a tense 20 minutes close to the enemy whilst reloading it.|$|E
