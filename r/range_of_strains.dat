50|$|Simple bending {{behavior}} in homogenous beams suggests ε increases with {{distance from the}} neutral axis (z). This poses a problem to animals, such as fishes and salamanders, which undergo undulatory movement. Muscle fibers are constrained by the length-tension and force-velocity curves. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that muscle fibers recruited for a particular task must operate within an optimal <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>strains</b> (ε) and contractile velocities to generate peak force and power respectively. Non-uniform ε generation during undulatory movement would force differing muscle fibers recruited for the same task to operate on differing portions of the length-tension and force-velocity curves; performance would not be optimal. Alexander predicted that the dorsoventral (α) and mediolateral (φ) orientation of the white fibers of the fish axial musculature may allow more uniform strain across varying mesolateral fiber distances. Unfortunately, the white muscle fiber musculature of fishes is too complex to study uniform strain generation; however, Azizi et al. studied this phenomenon using a simplified salamander model.|$|E

A detailed numerical analysis of this specimen is presented to assess its <b>range</b> <b>of</b> applications and limitations. The dominant deformation mode of the gage section of the SCS {{is found to be}} shear. The stress and strain state in the gage section is necessarily three-dimensional, in contrast with commonly assumed situations of simple shear. Yet, considerable simplification is gained through the introduction of simple approximations for the Mises equivalent stress and plastic strain. These fields are found to be uniformly distributed over the gage section. The SCS framework is applied to the characterization <b>of</b> the large <b>strain</b> behavior <b>of</b> OFHC copper over a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> rates ε_ε = 10 ^(- 3) to 3. 2 × 10 ^ 4 s^(− 1).

40|$|Abstract: In this {{contribution}} a {{study is}} {{reported on a}} shear zone evolution at high strain rates for Ti- 6 AI- 4 V alloy. Such process of deformation, leading to development of Adiabatic Shear Band (ASB), is typical for fast and impact shearing. A very special experimental technique developed at LPMM-Metz bas permitted for shear tests at a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> rates and also for development of an advanced constitutive relation valid for that <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> rates and also for a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> temperatures (<b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> rates from 10 - 4 I/s to about 10 1 /s). This experimental technique called the Modified Double Shear {{has been applied to}} test Ti- 6 AI- 4 V alloy. In order to estimate the effect of stress concentration on the sensitivity to ASB triggering four different specimen geometries with different stress concentrators were tested and analyzed. After identification of all material constants for Ti- 6 AI- 4 V alloy in the advanced constitutive relation, this relation has been introduced into the finite element code ABAQUS Explicit. The constitutive relation accounts for the effects <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> hardening, rate sensitivity and thermal softening. In this way a complete dynamic approach with elastic-plastic wave propagation, adiabatic shear band development and failure could be studied numerically for all four geometries with different stress concentrators. In addition, the Critical Impact Velocity (CIV) in shear has been estimated analytically and numerically for Ti- 6 AI- 4 V.

We have generated a phoP mutant of the meningococcus by allele exchange. PhoP is a component of a two-component regulatory system which in other bacteria is an important regulator of virulence gene expression. Inactivation of the PhoP-PhoQ system in Salmonella leads to avirulence, and phoP mutants have been shown to confer protection against virulent challenge. These mutants have been examined as potential live attenuated vaccines. We here show that a phoP mutant of the meningococcus is avirulent in a mouse model of infection. Moreover, infection of mice with the phoP mutant stimulated a bactericidal immune response that not only killed the infecting strain but also showed cross-reactive bactericidal activity against a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>strains</b> with different serogroup, serotype, and serosubtyping antigens. Sera from the mutant-infected mice contained immunoglobulin G that bound to the surface of a range of meningococcal strains and mediated opsonophagocytosis of meningococci by human phagocytic cells.
