In 1982, US President Ronald Reagan commissioned William Nierenberg to sit on National Science Board. Nierenberg selected scientists including Gene Likens to sit on a panel to draft a report on acid rain. In 1983, the panel of scientists came up with a draft report, which concluded that acid rain is a real problem and solutions should be sought. White House Office of Science and Technology Policy reviewed the draft report and sent Fred Singer’s suggestions of the report, which cast doubt on the cause of acid rain. The panelists revealed rejections against Singer’s positions and submitted the report to Nirenberg in April. In May 1983, the House of Representatives voted against legislations that aimed to control sulfur emissions. There was a debate about whether Nierenberg delayed to release the report. Nierenberg himself denied the saying about his suppression of the report and explained that the withheld of the report after the House's vote was {{due to the fact that}} the report was not ready to be published.|$|E

50|$|Coos County at {{one time}} favored the Democratic Party {{and was one of}} the few {{counties}} in the West to be won by George McGovern. No Republican presidential candidate obtained a majority in the county between 1956 and 1996, although <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> obtain pluralities in both 1980 and - very narrowly - in 1984. Since the turn of the century it has become a solidly Republican county in Presidential elections as a result of de-unionization in the timber industry and opposition to Democratic environmental policies. The last Democrat to win a majority in Coos County was Michael Dukakis in 1988, although Bill Clinton won pluralities in both his elections.|$|E
50|$|The 1964 {{election}} saw Jackson County turn strongly Democratic due to {{the growth}} of student opposition to the conservative Republican nominee Barry Goldwater, and this student liberalism was sufficient eight years later to make Jackson County the only county in Illinois to vote for George McGovern over Richard Nixon, and one of five to vote for McGovern in 1972 and Alf Landon in 1936. <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> carry Jackson County in both his 1980 and 1984 triumphs, but he remains the last Republican to carry the county, although in common wiht the rest of Southern Illinois Mitt Romney and Donald Trump made substantial gains on previous GOP performances.|$|E

2500|$|In April 1984, NACODS {{voted to}} strike but was {{short of the}} two-thirds {{majority}} that their constitution required. In areas where the strike was observed, most NACODS members did not cross picket lines and, under an agreement from the 1972 strike, stayed off work on full pay. [...] When the number of strikebreakers increased in August, Merrick Spanton, the NCB personnel director, said he expected NACODS members to cross picket lines to supervise their work threatening the 1972 agreement {{which led to a}} second ballot. Ian MacGregor suggested that deputies could be replaced by outsiders as <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> had <b>done</b> during the 1981 airline strike. In September, for the first time, NACODS voted to strike with a vote of 81% in favour. The government then made concessions over the review procedure for unprofitable collieries, much to the anger of Ian MacGregor, and a deal negotiated by North Yorkshire NCB Director Michael Eaton persuaded NACODS to call off the strike action.|$|R
50|$|Rhode Island {{historically}} voted Republican until 1908, but {{has supported}} Democrats all but seven {{times in the}} 24 elections that have followed. In 1980, Rhode Island {{was one of only}} six states to vote against <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan.</b> <b>Reagan</b> <b>did</b> carry Rhode Island in his 49-state victory in 1984—only the third time since Eisenhower that a Republican carried the state. However, Reagan's 3.6 percent margin was his second-closest in the nation, ahead of only his 2.8 percent margin in Massachusetts. Despite George H. W. Bush aggressively contesting the state in 1988, Michael Dukakis won it by a fairly convincing 13 points, his best performance. The state has not been seriously contested since then, often giving Democratic candidates their biggest margins. It was Bill Clinton's second-best state in 1996 (behind only Arkansas) and Al Gore's best state in 2000. In 2004, Rhode Island gave John Kerry more than a 20-percentage-point margin of victory (the third-highest of any state), with 59.4% of its vote. All but three of Rhode Island's 39 cities and towns voted for the Democratic candidate. The only exceptions were East Greenwich, West Greenwich and Scituate.|$|R

In January, the program, considered in retrospect to have been highly innovative, became a straightforward anthology with Bridges hosting each episode, much as <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan</b> had <b>done</b> with the General Electric Theater and Jane Wyman had prevailed with Jane Wyman Presents. The program featured Bridges's sons, Jeff and Beau Bridges, in occasional guest-starring roles. The premiere episode is entitled [...] "Wheresoever I Enter". [...] "A Pair of Boots" [...] casts Bridges as a Confederate whose truce with the Union Army is threatened by a southern soldier's desire to reclaim {{a pair of shoes}} stolen by a northerner. Co-stars in the episode are son Beau Bridges. Royal Dano, and Seymour Cassel. In the episode [...] "My Daddy Can Beat Your Daddy", authored by Robert Towne, the screenwriter of Chinatown, Bridges plays an aging boxer fighting a match against his own son. Co-stars in the segment are son Jeff Bridges, Gary Lockwood, and Mary Murphy.|$|R

2500|$|Two former gay lovers, Pete, and {{the narrator}} of the novel Tim, are reunited when Tim needs a ride back to Los Angeles. They go on a surreal {{adventure}} over the next day-and-a-half, {{most of it in}} cars, with memories of the last twenty years, including tea rooms and bathhouses, increasingly enraging them at the AIDS pandemic destruction. Sleep deprived, using gallows humor and self-medicating with mescaline-spiked drinks they travel through an increasingly hostile environment meeting a bizarre and queer cast of supporting characters who fuel undercurrent rage at society's homophobia and the LGBT community's apathy. They meet an occult-obsessed indie filmmaker, leather-dykes, a Southern belle drag queen and then four anarchistic gays who are HIV-positive. The quartet reflect the hopelessness felt as their friends die and the country does little to counteract a [...] "gay" [...] disease. They hope to win the cultural war by assassinating ex-President <b>Ronald</b> <b>Reagan,</b> who <b>did</b> little for the first four years of growing HIV-AIDS epidemic, by bombing him at a church service. Tim and Pete convince the plotters to change targets to a meeting of the American Family Association, a group known for its anti-LGBT rhetoric that led to the failed response to AIDS, where there would be fewer [...] "innocent" [...] victims.|$|R
