5|$|Defining {{exactly what}} {{section of a}} DNA {{sequence}} comprises a gene is difficult. <b>Regulatory</b> regions of a gene such as enhancers do not necessarily have {{to be close to}} the coding sequence on the linear molecule because the intervening DNA can be looped out to bring the gene and its <b>regulatory</b> region into proximity. Similarly, a gene's introns can be much larger than its exons. <b>Regulatory</b> regions can even be on entirely different chromosomes and operate in trans to allow <b>regulatory</b> regions on one chromosome to come in contact with target genes on another chromosome.|$|E
5|$|The process {{requires}} the regulator to directly link a robust risk assessment to a suggested <b>regulatory</b> response (e.g. financial penalties, criminal imprisonment). <b>Regulatory</b> risk differentiation is {{also referred to}} as the Compliance Model in some <b>regulatory</b> agencies. See for example the Australian Prudential <b>Regulatory</b> Authority risk differentiation approach known as: PAIRS / SOARS. PAIRS is the Probability And Impact Rating System, while SOARS is the Supervisory Oversight And Response System.|$|E
5|$|Myosin <b>regulatory</b> {{light chain}} 2, {{ventricular}}/cardiac muscle isoform (MLC-2) {{also known as}} the <b>regulatory</b> light chain of myosin (RLC) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MYL2 gene. This cardiac ventricular RLC isoform is distinct from that expressed in skeletal muscle (MYLPF), smooth muscle (MYL12B) and cardiac atrial muscle (MYL7).|$|E

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{has been}} {{coordinating}} a network called the International <b>Regulatory</b> Cooperation for Herbal Medicines {{to try to}} improve the quality of medical products made from medicinal plants and the claims made for them. In 2015, only around 20% of countries had well-functioning <b>regulatory</b> agencies, while 30% had none, and around half had limited <b>regulatory</b> capacity. In India, where Ayurveda has been practised for centuries, herbal remedies are the responsibility of a government department, AYUSH, under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare.|$|E
5|$|Three prime untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of {{messenger}} RNAs (mRNAs) often contain <b>regulatory</b> sequences that post-transcriptionally cause RNA interference. Such 3'-UTRs often contain both binding {{sites for}} microRNAs (miRNAs) {{as well as}} for <b>regulatory</b> proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3'-UTR also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of a mRNA.|$|E

25|$|Suppressor {{population}} or <b>Regulatory</b> T cell theory, wherein <b>regulatory</b> T-lymphocytes (commonly CD4+FoxP3+ cells, among others) {{function to}} prevent, downregulate, or limit autoaggressive immune {{responses in the}} immune system.|$|E
25|$|Gene <b>regulatory</b> {{networks}} are generally {{thought to be}} made up of a few highly connected nodes (hubs) and many poorly connected nodes nested within a hierarchical <b>regulatory</b> regime. Thus gene <b>regulatory</b> networks approximate a hierarchical scale free network topology. This is consistent with the view that most genes have limited pleiotropy and operate within <b>regulatory</b> modules. This structure is thought to evolve due to the preferential attachment of duplicated genes to more highly connected genes. Recent work has also shown that natural selection tends to favor networks with sparse connectivity.|$|E
25|$|Passed as a {{response}} to the financial crisis of 2007–2008, it brought the most significant changes to financial regulation in the United States since the <b>regulatory</b> reform that followed the Great Depression. It made changes in the American financial <b>regulatory</b> environment that affected all federal financial <b>regulatory</b> agencies and almost every part of the nation's financial services industry.|$|E
25|$|Eukaryotic genes {{also contain}} <b>regulatory</b> {{sequences}} beyond the core promoter. These cis-acting control elements bind transcriptional activators or repressors to {{increase or decrease}} transcription from the core promoter. Well-characterized <b>regulatory</b> elements include enhancers, silencers, and insulators. These <b>regulatory</b> sequences can be spread over a large genomic distance, sometimes located hundreds of kilobases from the core promoters.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>regulatory</b> framework in place, each federal financial supervisory agency's Inspector General performs regular audits on any <b>regulatory</b> changes made {{to see if the}} intended goals are actually being fulfilled.|$|E
25|$|Synthetic ETFs are {{attracting}} <b>regulatory</b> {{attention from}} the FSB, the IMF, and the BIS. Areas of concern include the lack of transparency in products and increasing complexity; conflicts of interest; and lack of <b>regulatory</b> compliance.|$|E
25|$|One major {{difference}} between <b>regulatory</b> T cells and effector T cells is that <b>regulatory</b> T cells typically serve to modulate and deactivate the immune response, while effector T cell groups usually begin with immune-promoting cytokines and then switch to inhibitory cytokines later in their life cycle. The latter is a feature of Th3 cells, which transform into a <b>regulatory</b> subset after its initial activation and cytokine production.|$|E
25|$|This period {{also saw}} the {{increased}} rise of the environmental and consumer movements, and the government established new regulations and <b>regulatory</b> {{agencies such as the}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Nuclear <b>Regulatory</b> Commission, and others.|$|E
25|$|Before the Water Framework Law was adopted, {{there was}} no <b>regulatory</b> {{framework}} {{that could have been}} applied in decentralizing processes such as the developments in San Pedro Sula and Puerto Cortés. Thus, local <b>regulatory</b> agencies were created for the concession contracts to secure a sustained process. For instance, in Puerto Cortés a <b>regulatory</b> agency was created at the municipal level including selected representatives of civil society, such as doctors, engineers and lawyers.|$|E
25|$|Glucokinase can be rapidly {{activated}} and inactivated in hepatocytes by a novel <b>regulatory</b> protein (glucokinase <b>regulatory</b> protein), {{which operates}} {{to maintain an}} inactive reserve of GK, which can be made quickly available in response to rising levels of portal vein glucose.|$|E
25|$|Later, by the {{sequence}} similarity, a similar protein {{was found in}} Chlamydomonas algae, showing that this <b>regulatory</b> subsystem existed {{a long time before}} the angiosperms lost the independent conversion enzyme. In a different manner, the Chlamydomonas <b>regulatory</b> protein is more complex: It is larger, crosses the thylakoid membrane twice rather than once, contains more protein-protein interactions sites, and even undergoes alternative splicing. It appears that the <b>regulatory</b> system underwent simplification during evolution.|$|E
25|$|The first {{oncolytic}} {{virus to}} be approved by a <b>regulatory</b> agency was a genetically modified adenovirus named H101 by Shanghai Sunway Biotech. It gained <b>regulatory</b> approval in 2005 from China's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) for the treatment of head and neck cancer.|$|E
25|$|In {{other recent}} work, {{multiscale}} models of gene <b>regulatory</b> networks {{have been developed}} that focus on synthetic biology applications.

25|$|As of 2012, {{the efforts}} have shifted toward finding {{interactions}} between DNA and <b>regulatory</b> proteins by the technique ChIP-Seq, or gaps where the DNA is not packaged by histones (DNase hypersensitive sites), {{both of which}} tell where there are active <b>regulatory</b> sequences in the investigated cell type.|$|E
25|$|Not always {{included}} within the operon, but important in its function is a <b>regulatory</b> gene, a constantly expressed gene which codes for repressor proteins. The <b>regulatory</b> gene {{does not need}} to be in, adjacent to, or even near the operon to control it.|$|E
25|$|Ingestive {{behaviors}} encompass all {{eating and}} drinking behaviors. These actions are influenced by physiological <b>regulatory</b> mechanisms; these mechanisms exist to control and establish homeostasis within the human body.
