5|$|The Pink Member of the Claron Formation {{is largely}} {{composed}} of easily eroded and relatively soft limestone.

5|$|The Jeopardy! staff used {{different}} {{means to}} notify Watson {{and the human}} players when to buzz, which was critical in many <b>rounds.</b> <b>The</b> humans were notified by a light, which took them tenths of a second to perceive.

The humans tried {{to compensate for the}} perception delay by anticipating the light, but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watson's response time. Watson did not attempt to anticipate the notification signal.|$|E
5|$|The NBA Finals {{has always}} {{employed}} a best-of-seven series format.
