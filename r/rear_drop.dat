40|$|We {{consider}} {{policies for}} deciding which cells {{will be lost}} or dropped when losses occur at a finite buffer ATM node. The performance criteria of interest % particularly for voice traffiç are the delay of transmitted (non-lost) cells, the jitter (or variability in the delay of transmitted cells), and the burstiness of lost cells. We analyze the performance tradeoffs for various cell dropping policies. We show the usual the «rear dropping» in which cells that arrive to a full buffer are lost stochastically maximizes delay, while «front dropping,» in which cells {{at the front of}} the buffer are lost, stochastically minimizes delay. On the other hand, <b>rear</b> <b>dropping</b> stochastically minimizes the jitter. We also propose policies that have both stochastically smaller delay and less lost cell burstiness in a stochastic majorization sense than the <b>rear</b> <b>dropping</b> policy...|$|R

25|$|The PS2 {{followed}} the PD2 Titan in having the 125bhp 9.8-litre O600 engine {{and a new}} synchromesh gearbox. With changes to rules on width and length there were numerous {{different versions of the}} home market PS2 based on permutations of width and length, whether built with or without a <b>rear</b> <b>dropped</b> frame and whether reconstructed from short-wheelbase chassis or built new to the longer wheelbase. PS2/1, 3, 5 and 7 had a 17ft 6in wheelbase for 27ft 6in bodywork. PS2/10, 11, 12, 12A, 13, 13A, 14 and 15 had a longer wheelbase of 18ft 9in for 30ft long coachwork (but see later about the six-wheel PS2/10 and /11). The entire home market Tiger range was vacuum-braked and PS2s for the UK had the synchromesh gearbox only, whilst the Titan PD2 had a number of options including constant-mesh, AEC preselector and Pneumocyclic. The last new PS2 coaches entered service in 1953 with West Riding Automobile Company, and the last home-market customer for the Tiger PS2 bus was the Burnley, Colne and Nelson Joint Transport Committee, their last arrived in 1955 and put in 20 years and more of work, thus being the last half-cab single deckers on normal service in the UK.|$|R

When French lookouts spotted distant topsails, Villaret de Joyeuse decided that Cornwallis's actions meant that a British fleet was approaching to support him, and called off the pursuit. There was no British fleet in the vicinity; the topsails were those of a convoy of British merchantmen.|$|R

5000|$|Through its lifespan, it was {{available}} with a Detroit Diesel two-stroke V8 and V6, the Bedford 500 turbo engine {{also known as}} the [...] "8.2 Blue", or a Cummins L10 - coupled to either a Fuller or Spicer transmission, and a S.O.M.A. <b>rear</b> axle (<b>dropped</b> after the 1982 facelift). The Detroit engine (introduced in 1982) was not a successful choice in the UK. Because of its high-revving characteristics, it proved unpopular with drivers, who were used to slow revving, long stroke, UK diesels. It was also disliked by operators because of its poor fuel economy.|$|R
50|$|Later NKVD, SMERSH and GRU began {{training}} special {{groups of}} future partisans (effectively, special forces units) in the <b>rear</b> and <b>dropping</b> {{them in the}} occupied territories. The candidates for these groups were chosen among volunteers from regular Red Army, NKVD's Internal Troops, and also among Soviet sportsmen. When dropped behind Axis lines, the groups were to organize and guide the local self-established partisan units. Radio operators and intelligence gathering officers were the essential members of each group since amateur fighters could not be trusted with these tasks. Some commanders of these special units (like Dmitry Medvedev) later became well-known partisan leaders.|$|R
50|$|Track renewal trains {{have now}} {{replaced}} labour-intensive permanent way gangs. Long welded rail {{was hard to}} install manually. An early demonstration of mechanised track-laying with two 600 ft lengths of long welded rail {{took place on the}} Fighting Cocks branch in 1958. The two lengths were loaded on ten wagons, attached to the existing track by a steel rope and drawn back at 30 ft a minute. As the train moved back, the old rails were levered out and the new ones dropped into the chairs. A hoist on the <b>rear</b> wagon <b>dropped</b> {{the last part of the}} rail into place.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} variations and styles of motorcycle lifts. Some are simple and only large enough to handle a simple motorbike. Others have front and side extensions that make them long enough for a chopper and wide enough for an All-terrain vehicle. Most lifts come with a clamp for the front wheel to help stabilize the bike so that it stands upright on its own. Other options that these motorcycle lift tables have are the <b>rear</b> wheel <b>drop</b> out that allows {{the back of the}} table to be taken away so that a person can perform maintenance on their rear tire without it touching the table.|$|R
5000|$|Uppercut — a vertical, rising punch thrown {{with the}} rear hand. From the guard position, the torso shifts {{slightly}} to the right, the <b>rear</b> hand <b>drops</b> {{below the level of}} the opponent's chest and the knees are bent slightly. From this position, the rear hand is thrust upwards in a rising arc towards the opponent's chin or torso. At the same time, the knees push upwards quickly and the torso and hips rotate counter‐clockwise and the rear heel turns outward, mimicking the body movement of the cross. The strategic utility of the uppercut depends on its ability to [...] "lift" [...] the opponent's body, setting it off‐balance for successive attacks.|$|R
60|$|A strange plunge it {{was into}} the utter darkness, {{crawling}} {{on hands and}} knees, with the chill cavernous gloom and rock seeming to press in upon those who slowly crept along, {{the dim light of}} Sigbert's lamp barely showing as he slowly moved on before. One of the two in the <b>rear</b> was <b>dropped</b> and extinguished in the dismal passage, a loss proclaimed by a suppressed groan passing along the line, and a louder exclamation from Walter, causing Sigbert to utter a sharp 'Hush!' enforced by a thud and tramp above, as if the rock were coming down on them, but which probably was the trampling of horses in the camp above.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{were carried}} out on some factors {{affecting}} brood rearing activity of honeybee colonies in two apiaries of the College of Agriculture, King Saud University at Al - Deriyah (Northern Riyadh) and Dirab (Southern Riyadh). Colonies of the former site significantly surpassed those of the latter {{with respect to the}} monthly pollen storage rate by 26. 7 %. This had a significant effect on the monthly worker brood rearing rate. High correlation coefficients (b = 0. 7036 and 0. 5306) existed for worker and drone rearing consecutively. The smallest area of worker brood were obtained during October in Dirab (112. 7 sq. in.) and in Al - Deriyah (122. 4 sq. in.). There was a single peak of worker brood during March (Al-Deriyah) and /or April (Dirab). In both years colonies at Al-Deriyah showed 25. 6 % more brood rearing activity than Dirab colonies (F-value 4. 57 **). About 93 % of drones were reared during January - June. The average rate of drone rearing activity in both sites was 10. 49 ± 2. 69 sq. in. /month/colony. Drone brood <b>rearing</b> <b>dropped</b> down to 45. 5 % and 33 % of the previous year in Al-Deriyah and Dirab colonies respectively (F-value 7. 79 **). This deterioration could be due to the high incidence of honeybee pests and diseases that occurred in the second year. Among the effects of the prevailing weather factors on colony activities, only sunshine showed moderate correlation with worker brood rearing (- 0. 3437), drone brood rearing (- 0. 4762) and pollen collection and storage (- 0. 5358). No significant correlations existed with the maximum and minimum temperatures, relative humidity and wind speed...|$|R
50|$|At {{a glance}} {{it would seem}} that the only {{difference}} between the coupe and convertible concepts would be the roof and Hugger Orange pearl tri-coat paint job with a pair of dark gray racing stripes, but this is not the case. Besides the obvious convertible top, there are subtle changes to the exterior as well. Every surface was changed from the door-cut back. The <b>rear</b> fenderlines <b>drop</b> off from the horizontal surface to the vertical surface a couple of inches farther out than on the coupe to keep proportions good and the rear spoiler was reshaped. The 21 in front and 22 in rear wheels were also redesigned and a thin orange line was applied to the outer edge, a nod to redwalls available circa 1969.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{mechanical}} features {{included a}} 1956 Chevrolet <b>rear</b> end, <b>dropped</b> Ford front axle beam, Buick brake drums and early Ford brakes. The frame was handmade of rectangular 2x4 inch steel tubing. The engine was a leftover {{from one of}} Roth's 1955 Chevrolets, having been removed {{to make way for}} a then-new Mark IV big-block given to him by General Motors. It was one of the very few completed cars Roth deemed to be a [...] "mistake" [...] because he felt the car did not show well since the heavily chromed engine and most of the chassis were hidden. The Orbitron was, in fact, one of his few customs to have a hood. Reportedly, the hydraulically operated hood did not fit well due to rushed fiberglass work.|$|R
50|$|Much {{attention}} {{was given to}} aerodynamic considerations, with the body being de-guttered/seam welded {{and the use of}} filler panels for the door pillars and 935-style mirrors. Prototype models had NACA-style intercooler intake ducts over the <b>rear</b> fenders (later <b>dropped,</b> as it was discovered that air was pulled out, rather than in, at speed due to a low-pressure area), while later models had additional slots in the rear bumper corners for the air to exit.|$|R
5000|$|Just before half distance, Schell’s Maserati {{started making}} unusual noises, and {{eventually}} slowed and pitted. As the drive shaft grease retaining seal had split, the team retired the car. Scarlatti was {{called into the}} pits and Schell took over the car. By now Moss’s lead over Collins was 65 seconds, about half-a-lap, with Musso a lap adrift in third. At 3:15pm, the windy dull day, turned worse with pouring rain. Collins started to lost ground rapidly, as his Ferrari’s brakes were being too erratic in the wet conditions, to take any chances. 15 minutes, later Musso trundled slowly towards pits with a punctured <b>rear</b> tyre, <b>dropping</b> the car down to fifth, behind Scott-Brown and Schell. The 30-minute spell of rain, Moss gained another half-a-lap on Collins, giving him a full lap advantage over his countryman.|$|R
500|$|In the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown on 20 July, Ladas met Isinglass again, {{this time}} over ten furlongs on soft ground. Isinglass started {{favourite}} at 4/5 (0.8/1) with Ladas on 13/8 (1.6/1) {{and the other}} runners, who included Raeburn, Ravensbury and a filly named Throstle virtually ignored. The outsider Priestholme set off at an unsustainably fast pace, followed by Isinglass, with Watts restraining Ladas towards the <b>rear.</b> Priestholme <b>dropped</b> away in the straight, leaving Isinglass in the lead with Watts moving Ladas up to challenge. The two Derby winners dominated the race in the closing stages {{but in spite of}} a [...] "game pursuit", Ladas was unable to overhaul Isinglass, who won by a length {{with the rest of the}} field, headed by Throstle, well beaten. There were no excuses for Ladas: Watts admitted that he had been beaten by a better horse.|$|R
