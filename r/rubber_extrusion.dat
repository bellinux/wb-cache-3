Each design concept was evaluated by an {{industry advisory panel}} using a comprehensive set of technical, economic and institutional criteria. Key electrical and mechanical concerns that effect further array subsystem development are also discussed. Three integrated array design concepts were selected by the advisory panel for further optimization and development. From these concepts a single one will be selected for detailed analysis and prototype fabrication. The three concepts selected are: (1) An array of frameless panels/modules sealed in a T shaped zipper locking neoprene gasket grid pressure fitted into an extruded aluminum channel grid fastened across the rafters.

40|$|Abstract:- A {{direct control}} {{strategy}} for the process of mixing components for producing rubber for profiles of automotive industry is not suitable, since {{the goal is to}} build a product with specified parameters which are not directly measurable. The measuring process is carried out offline in a laboratory and downwards the process. Also in these cases an open control strategy must be adopted. In this work, the authors develop a model to online predict the cure characteristics of the blends according to their compound formulation and mixing conditions. If properly integrated into the manufacturing system, cure characteristics models can provide useful information to process the blends according to their specific characteristics.

40|$|There {{are many}} {{industrial}} applications in which shear and extensional {{behaviors of the}} material both play a role. This is true, for example, for flows in converging channels or flows in abrupt contractions typical of cable coating, fiber spinning or indeed flows in many plastics and <b>rubber</b> <b>extrusion</b> dies. Viscoelastic flow simulation {{has made it possible}} to predict these effects, at least qualitatively. Numerical simulations using a 3 -mode PTT model reported here show a good quantitative agreement with experimentally measured pressure drops over a range of flow rates for both a short and a long conical capillary die. While this approach is physically meaningful, convergence at high Weissenberg number remains a challenge for the scientific community. This fact can sometimes justify the call for simpler, qualitative engineering approximations. By adding in the flow equations the dependence of the viscosity function on the third invariant of the rate of deformation tensor, it becomes possible to consider some effects of extensional viscosity in axisymmetric and 3 D flows. We observe an increase in the pressure drop and the onset of recirculation patterns. We present numerical simulations of flow in a converging cone capillary and compare the results with available experimental data. We include simulation results for 3 D die swell which show the influence of this extensional effect...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a research work which {{was carried out}} to develop a vision based cross sectional area profiling system suitable for continuous rubber profile extrusion processes. Rubber profiles are mostly used in rubber track production industry as a semi finished raw material. The linear volume of these profiles {{is a very important}} parameter for overall quality controlling of track production process. In order to maintain the linear volume it is a must that the cross section be measured and maintained within limits. Since the profile is continuously extruded by profile extruders, the profile cross section area measurement is best to be done in an online basis than off-line basis. A computer vision based online measurement system was developed which consists of a line laser projected on to the profile while a low cost digital camera observes the projection of this laser line on the profile. A vision software {{to be used in the}} system was also developed to interpret the captured cross section images in real time and produce numerical measurements and finally display on a computer with graphical user interface. The developed system is capable of measuring trapezoidal shape cross sections at a maximum rate of 6 measurements per second with repeatability error limited to } 2 % which preferably satisfies state of art <b>rubber</b> <b>extrusion</b> process quality controlling requirements. It can be concluded that with suitable further improvements, the technology can be integrated to extruder controlling systems as a feedback signal to control its output profile dimensions...|$|E

40|$|In this {{bachelor}} thesis, the kinetics of crystallization was {{studied for}} three PP copolymers with ethylene-propylene <b>rubber</b> after multiple <b>extrusion.</b> The crystallization rate was determined from the diameter growth of spherulites with time. The growth was observed in-situ by polarizing optical microscope (POM). Isothermal melt-crystallization was investigated at three temperatures (135, 140 and 150 °C). The crystallization rate decreased with temperature for all samples and varied among particular samples {{the most likely}} due to the different structure (different polymerization technology). The third extrusion has not affected the crystallization rate compared with the first one.

40|$|The {{development}} of solid-state catheters with miniature pressure transducers and portable dataloggers {{with a large}} memory capacity has allowed recording of gastrointestinal motility in ambulant subjects. Developments in silicone <b>rubber</b> <b>extrusion</b> technology {{made it possible to}} build a perfused manometric system, using a perfused manometric assembly requiring a low volume of perfusate. In the present study the feasibility of recording and automated analysis of small intestinal motility using a perfused multiple lumen manometric system was evaluated in seven healthy volunteers. Pressures were recorded from 12 sideholes arranged in four clusters spaced at 10 -cm intervals from the catheter tip. Each channel was perfused at 0. 15 mL min- 1 with degassed water by a portable, low-compliance, perfusion pump. The 12 sidehole recording channels were connected to external transducers mounted on a belt. Pressure data were stored in two dataloggers. Motility was recorded in the sitting (30 min), and supine (30 min) position, during walking (30 min) and postprandially (90 min). Using purpose-built software baseline variations were corrected for and manometric variables (number of pressure waves, mean amplitude and motility index) calculated. Bench testing of the manometric assembly showed a median baseline pressure offset of 4. 2 kPa (range 3. 7 - 10. 1) and upon occlusion a rise rate of 27. 8 kPa sec- 1 (range 19. 7 - 30. 8). Changes in body position affected baseline pressures so that compared to the supine position changes in baseline pressure varied between 1. 5 +/- 0. 7 kPa and 1. 9 +/- 0. 6 kPa during sitting (P < 0. 02), and between 1. 7 +/- 0. 7 kPa and 1. 5 +/- 0. 9 kPa during walking (P < 0. 03). Manometric recordings obtained during the fasting period showed an increase in small intestinal motor activity during walking. In the postprandial period no differences in motility variables were observed within one cluster and in time. Recording of small intestinal motility with a multiple-channel silicone rubber manometric assembly with a portable perfusion system is a feasible technique which is relatively inexpensive. Computer-assisted data processing allows for adequate elimination of artefacts and automated numerical analysi...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose is}} the {{evaluation}} of a possibility of intensification of <b>extrusion</b> of high-viscous <b>rubber</b> stock by using roll heads {{and the development of}} a method of designing structural and technological parameters of the roll heads on the basis of theoretical and experimental studies of the <b>rubber</b> stock <b>extrusion</b> process through a profiling channel of intricate geometric shape. A mathematical model describing the flow of a viscous fluid in a rectilinear channel of intricate shape has been constructed as applied to the process of <b>extrusion</b> of <b>rubber</b> stock by using the roll heads; a method of analysis of a dynamic flow of an abnormal-viscous fluid in an intricate-shape channel of variable section has been devised. A numerical analysis of the dependence of the hydrodynamic characterictics in the technological and geometric parameters at extruding the rubber stock through a profiling channel of intricate shape has been accomplished. A method of determining the basic structural parameters of the roll head, i. e. the radius of sizing rolls and the relation between the clearances in the roll and slot portions of the head has been devised.

50|$|In the 1980s and 1990s {{replacement}} parts for Clavinets became harder to find, as Hohner {{had ceased to}} support them. In 2000, Hohner USA relocated to a new facility and sold remaining spare parts inventory to Clavinet.com. The principal clavinet restoration issues are hammer tips and strings. The original hammer tips were made of a polymer compound that decomposes with age, so they became sticky and ultimately liquefied into a paste. Hohner intended that the tips be a service replaceable item, as in normal use they develop grooves and occasionally split. Restorers and players who wanted to keep a Clavinet working had to fashion their own tips from <b>rubber</b> or polymer <b>extrusions.</b> Clavinet.com manufactured the first aftermarket molded replacement hammer tip set in 1999, leading {{to an increase in}} the number of working clavinets and renewing interest in the instrument. Clavinet strings, while similar in gauge and style to guitar strings, are longer, making readily available substitutes a problem. Clavinet.com manufactured the first aftermarket Clavinet string set in 2000, and remained the only replacement string supplier for the entire decade—bringing more previously unusable clavinets back into service. In the 2000s, a number of businesses have begun to service and maintain vintage keyboards, and {{replacement parts}} for the Clavinet are now available from multiple suppliers.|$|R
