5000|$|In architecture, a lunette (French lunette, [...] "little moon") is a {{half-moon}} shaped space, either {{filled with}} <b>recessed</b> <b>masonry</b> or void. A lunette is formed when a horizontal cornice transects a round-headed arch {{at the level}} of the imposts, where the arch springs. If a door is set within a round-headed arch, the space within the arch above the door, masonry or glass, is a lunette. If the door is a major access, and the lunette above is massive and deeply set, it may be called a tympanum.|$|E
5000|$|Lochiel was {{constructed}} {{as a private}} residence and underwent two major extensions before its conversion into six flats. The earliest section of the building consisted of the existing masonry core, which comprises a south facing wing with basement rooms, and a wing at the rear forming an L-shaped plan. A large timber [...] "museum" [...] wing {{was added to the}} western end of the building forming a U-shaped plan. This wing is high-set with a <b>recessed</b> <b>masonry</b> enclosed room below. The rear wing was extended to the north and a second storey added, and later the courtyard space at the rear was enclosed. The building was subsequently converted into flats.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] {{eastern end}} is a {{symmetrical}} composition with large stucco quoins and capitals visually supporting the raked moulded cornice to the gable. The centrally placed entrance is {{framed by a}} projecting balcony with a wrought iron balustrade supported on Doric- style columns. A tall, arched doorway with ruled stucco keystone and reveals opens onto the balcony and is framed by tall rectangular windows with timber framed casements. Windows on the lower level are timber framed and <b>recessed</b> into the <b>masonry</b> facade and ornate wrought iron bars secure the openings. The entrance door has been replaced with an aluminum hinged door.|$|R
25|$|The 1828 design {{originally}} {{filled the}} lock chamber {{through the use}} of culverts in the lock masonry. The wicket, i.e. large paddle valve, hidden in the <b>masonry</b> <b>recess</b> where the upper gate fit in, would be opened, and water would flow through the lock masonry to three openings in the lock chamber. Both sides of the lock had these, so there would be a total of 2 wickets, and 6 openings. The upper gate is above the breast wall. Most of the wicket openings in the upper gate recess have been closed with masonry, but one wicket at Violettes Lock is still intact as of 2013 (see photo). Note that modern replacement gates in locks 1-23, have the wickets in the gates, since the original wickets in the lock masonry are inoperable. This system of routing water through the masonry was abandoned due the tendency for debris to clog the opening.|$|R
