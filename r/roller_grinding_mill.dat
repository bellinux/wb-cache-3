40|$|The work is {{concerned}} with the effects of applying the drum detachers as flake disrupters in industrial wheat flour mills. The stocks entering and leaving the drum detachers applied on the different reduction passages in two industrial mills were intercepted and employed in the experiments. The changes in the flour release and flour ash content were followed. The results show that the drum detachers are effective in disrupting the flakes formed in the smooth <b>roller</b> <b>mills</b> <b>grinding</b> zone. However, the contribution of the drum detachers to the overall milling efficiency is in close correlation with the nature of the formed flakes. If the flakes are primarily composed of endosperm particles, the employment of drum detacher results in a statistically significant increase of the flour yields without deterioration of flour quality. If flakes, formed on the end passages of the reduction system, contain large portion of branny particles, the increase of the flour ash content following the drum detacher is statistically significant.

40|$|<b>Grinding</b> <b>mills</b> {{are used}} {{extensively}} in the mining, cement and minerals processing industries. Numerous failures of drivetrain components of <b>grinding</b> <b>mills</b> have occurred in recent years. The components are not meeting their required design lives leaving mill owners concerned about the expensive repair costs and lost profits associated with the mill downtime during repairs. There {{is a need to}} research the design methodology of the drivetrain components of <b>grinding</b> <b>mills</b> and the analysis of fatigue failures in mills and similar equipment e. g. kilns in order to develop a comprehensive and improved picture of how to design and operate these mills. As with numerous other engineered items, the critical issue is that a thorough understanding of the type, magnitude, direction, and duration of all loads that the components will experience while in operation is required in order to design them correctly. A literature survey was performed to research advanced design methods and identify sources of loading data for <b>grinding</b> <b>mills.</b> Many interesting references were identified but no specific examples were found where strain gauge measurements were used to quantify the loads experienced by the drivetrain components of <b>grinding</b> <b>mills.</b> Strain gauge measurements were conducted on the drivetrains of 30 <b>grinding</b> <b>mills.</b> The measured data was processed and analysed to determine the key operating loads experienced by the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> drivetrain components. These loads were used in a review of the engineering design calculations for these components and the important findings are highlighted. Finally, comprehensive fatigue analysis was conducted using the measured data to understand the major contributors to poor service life of the drivetrain components. Based on the findings of the investigation, several conclusions and recommendations are made that can serve as useful guidelines for improving the service life of <b>grinding</b> <b>mills</b> for both designers and operators of these machines...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to test if further {{grinding}} of corn DDGS is advantageous in terms of apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, GE, nitrogen (N), and NDF in growing and finishing pigs. It was also tested to determine if ATTD was different between hammermill and <b>roller</b> <b>mill</b> <b>grinding</b> methods. There were 3 diets. Each diet consisted of 51 % corn ground at 500 microns with a roller mill, and 45 % of corn DDGS ground at 450 microns using a hammermill, or 45 % corn DDGS ground at 450 microns using a roller mill, or 45 % of corn DDGS not further ground (unprocessed) at 650 microns. Results show that particle size reduction either with a roller mill or a hammermill (from 650 to 450 microns) increased ATTD of GE and DM of corn DDGS, tended to increase ATTD of N, but had no effect on ATTD of NDF. Finishing pigs had grater ATTD of GE and CP than growing pigs (tended to be greater for ATTD of DM). There were no effects of growth stage in ATTD of NDF. There were no interactions between particle size reduction and growth stage. In conclusion, reduction of particle size of corn DDGS (650 to 450 microns) either with a roller or with a hammermill has a beneficial effect on digestibility of valuable dietary components in growing and finishing pigs...|$|R

40|$|A <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit forms {{a crucial}} part in the {{energy-intensive}} comminution process of extracting valuable metals and minerals from mined ore. The ability to control the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit is of primary importance to achieve the desired product specification with regards to quality and production rate. In order to achieve control objectives an accurate dynamic model of the milling circuit is required. Phenomenological models are preferred over linear-time-invariant models since the latter cannot describe the non-linear behaviour of the process. However, the available phenomenological models of <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuits are usually complex, use large parameter sets and are mostly aimed towards steady-state design of <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuits. This study investigates simplified non-linear dynamic models of <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuits suitable for process controller design. In {{the first part of}} this study, the number of size classes in a cumulative rates model of a <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit is reduced to determine the minimum number required to provide a reasonably accurate model of the circuit for process control. Each reduced size class set is used to create a non-linear cumulative rates model which is linearized to design a linear model predictive controller. The accuracy of a model is determined by the ability of the corresponding model predictive controller to control important process variables in the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit as represented by the full non-linear cumulative rates model. The second part of the study validates a simple and novel non-linear model of a run-of-mine <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit developed for process control and estimation purposes. This model is named the Hulbert-model and makes use of the minimum number of states and parameters necessary to produce responses that are qualitatively accurate. It consists of separate feeder, mill, sump and hydrocyclone modules that can be connected to model different circuit configurations. The model uses five states: rocks, solids, fines, water and steel balls. Rocks are defined as too large to be discharged from the mill, whereas solids, defined as particles small enough to leave the mill, consist of out-of-specification coarse ore and in-specification fine ore fractions. The model incorporates a unique prediction of the rheology of the slurry within the mill. A new hydrocyclone model is also presented. The Hulbert-model parameters are fitted to an existing plantâ€™s sampling campaign data and a step-wise procedure is given to fit the model to steady-state data. Simulation test results of the model are compared to sampling campaign data of the same plant at different steady-state conditions. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.
