Front focal plane reticles are slightly more durable, but most American users prefer that the reticle remains constant as the image changes size, so nearly all modern American variable power telescopic sights are rear focal plane designs.

Surprisingly, Benny showed up in the team uniform with a submachine gun. Sintong asked one of his subordinates to keep Benny out, but not to kick out boss. The RTAF SFR team were placed at the tarmac in case there was a hijacker trying to escape. When the team came in, the hijackers were surprised and fired at the team, but three of the hijackers were killed when the team returned fire. One of the Kopassus commandos was shot, probably by his comrades, as was the pilot, also probably by Kopassus commandos. The rest of the hostages were released unharmed.

30|$|A model, {{integrated}} with the symmetric concentrator, as illustrated in Fig. 3 c, was proposed with high solar collection efficiency. In this model, two giant similar clam shells consist of mirrors. Every planar mirror is around 400 -m distance apart. The structure was build up on the <b>rear</b> <b>plane</b> side at a marginally distinctive point to shape a fragmented clamshell mirror. While the symmetrical concentrator and the integrated structure do not use in between optical reflection imaging, every mirror’s reflection of sunlight just needs to drop anywhere on the solar PV cluster. A mounting structure is required with an objective to avoid hotspot areas. The pole length is estimated such that the axial mirror collector’s length is more than 10  km [1]. The large focal length offered a reasonable solar spot size by creating the sun’s picture on the solar collectors. An underlying integrated structure symmetrical concentrator idea provides the design flexibility of the solar clusters on the <b>rear</b> <b>plane</b> of the transmitter. In this way, power cabling separations are highly reduced, and the back sides of either the solar array or the microwave transmitter structure {{can be used for}} radiating heat.|$|E

30|$|A {{wireless}} {{data link}} between {{the left and right}} hearing aids enables binaural beamforming. Such a binaural system with one microphone on each hearing aid offers improved noise reduction compared to a two-microphone monaural hearing aid system. The performance gain arises from the larger microphone spacing and the ability to exploit the head shadow effect. The binaural benefit (improvement compared to the monaural solution) is largest when an interfering source is located close to the desired source, for instance, in the front half plane. For interferers located in the <b>rear</b> half <b>plane,</b> the binaural benefit is restricted to the low-frequency region where the monaural system has poor spatial resolution. Unlike the monaural solution, the binaural GSC is able to provide a uniform performance improvement regardless of whether the interferer is in the front or <b>rear</b> half <b>plane.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{abovementioned}} Sun Tower-based SSPS idea {{is based}} on satellites of standard size, which are merely connected in a balanced structure through a specific gravity slope. It has an inbuilt microwave generator and transmitter based on space solar power construction. Each satellite looks like a large sunflower directed towards earth. In the structure, the blossoms in their appearance exhibit transmitter arrangements and the leaflets on the trail are sun power accumulators. The idea is expected to transfer microwave energy at frequencies 2.45 or 5.8  GHz from an introductory equipped LEO orbit of 900  km altitude with a performing sun-synchronous focus to deliver 200 -MW microwave power on earth. Complete beam guiding capacity is kept at 60 °. The heat dismissal for energy transformation and molding frameworks {{is thought to be}} collected in small units, and for that reason, coordination with energy transformation frameworks is required [1]. On account of the microwave transmitter, heat removal is considered at the <b>rear</b> <b>plane</b> of the antenna cluster. The lines of power transmission are instigated from a single focal tie or tether connection point on the rear side; those are incorporated coordinately with the unit sub-arrays of the cluster.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-A surface {{occluding}} a {{more distant}} surface {{gives rise to}} interocularly unpaired regions to its immediate left and right. The unpaired region {{on the left side}} is visible only to the left eye, whereas that on the right side is visible only to the right eye. Thus for real world scenes there are opto-geometrical constraints which determine whether particular combinations of relative depth and right-eye-only or left-eye-only stimuli are ecologically valid or invalid. We report a demonstration and experiments to show that opto-geometrically “valid ” unpaired regions are seen as continuous with the <b>rear</b> <b>plane</b> and escape interocular suppression, whereas “invalid ” unpaired regions are perceived as closer and are suppressed vigorously. An additionai experiment indicates that the results cannot be understood in terms of correspondence solving, but require neural mechanisms that embody real-world occlusion constraints. These results suggest a rather close interaction between stereopsis and rivalry “modules”. Since explicit eye-of-origin information is lost relatively early in the hierarchical organization of cortical visual processing, we argue thar occlusion-related constraints must be embodied at such early levels.
