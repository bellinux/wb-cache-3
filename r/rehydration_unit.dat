40|$|A {{retrospective}} analysis of routinely collected {{data from a}} diarrhoea <b>rehydration</b> <b>unit</b> found clinically meaningful par-allel seasonal variation in plasma sodium and potassium concentrations. The prevalence of severe hypokalaemia was 7. 2 % and 0. 4 % in February and August respectively, and of severe hypernatraemia 0. 4 % and 5. 0 % respec-tively. These unexpected findings need prospective confir-mation and exploration in other settings. Aclinical impression of a sudden increase in theprevalence of severe hypokalaemia in children admittedto a diarrhoea <b>rehydration</b> <b>unit</b> in 1997 prompted an analysis of routinely collected laboratory data. The purpose of the exploratory analysis was to confirm the sudden increase and to identify temporal and geographic associations {{with a view to}} identifying a possible source. This report describes seasonal patterns of plasma sodium and potassium concentra-tions that were unexpectedly identified in this analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} {{received by}} children aged under 5 years with diarrhoea was {{studied in the}} Hospital Infantil de México (Federico Goméz), Mexico City. The costs of treatment were calculated and estimates were made of how these had changed since {{the establishment of an}} oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>unit</b> in the hospital in 1985. The results indicate that drug treatment of outpatients was generally appropriate and inexpensive. In contrast, the cost of drugs for inpatients was considerably higher. The seriousness of the cases justified much of this additional expense for inpatients, but there is evidence that the costs could be reduced further without jeopardizing the quality of the care. Diagnostic tests were relatively expensive, frequently failed to identify diarrhoeal etiology, and their results correlated poorly with the treatment prescribed. The oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>unit</b> resulted in significant savings by causing a 25 % fall in the number of inpatients with diarrhoea...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MMed) -University of Natal, Durban, 1988. The first {{twelve months}} {{operation}} of a five-bed <b>rehydration</b> <b>unit</b> at Osindisweni Hospital is described and data related to admissions presented. Osindisweni hospital is situated {{in a rural area}} north of Durban and has approximately 300 general beds with 60 000 outpatient attendances per year. A profile of children admitted to this unit was obtained and results are analysed according to the objectives of this study. The main findings of the study showed that 269 children were admitted to the unit during the study year and the majority of children were black African children, below three years of age, coming from rural areas. The children presented with acute diarrhoeal dehydration mostly of mild to moderate degree and were normally managed by oral rehydration therapy. Eighty-four percent of these children were successfully managed on the <b>rehydration</b> <b>unit</b> and only 13, 7 % received IV fluids. The majority of children requiring transfer to the ward had either persistent dehydrating diarrhoea or other complications such as malnutrition or septicaemia. No child died on the unit and no child {{died as a result of}} dehydration but 4 children died later as inpatients on the children's ward. The mortality of children admitted to the unit was therefore 1, 5 %. One hundred and nine patients were followed up (41, 6 % of questionnaires) and of these only 76 (69, 7 %) actually came for review the others presenting for other illnesses or else interviewed on the wards after transfer. However, most of these children had either no or minor complaints on follow up. Seventeen and a half percent of children were below the 3 rd centile for age on discharge. Children with marasmus and/or kwashiorkor were not admitted to the unit. The availability of health care was poorly assessed but indicated a general lack of facilities for the rural population served. Also it was noted that the principles of G. O. B. I. had been poorly taught at Osindisweni in the past, particularly growth. charts. Mothers received health education on the unit and were found to have a good understanding of G. O. B. I. after their stay on the unit. On the whole the unit was well accepted by the mothers. It is thought that this short-stay oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>unit</b> offers a more appropriate and more cost effective alternative to previous methods of in-patient management of children with diarrhoeal dehydration and that it offers an excellent opportunity for health education...|$|E
40|$|Cholera {{epidemics}} {{in refugee}} camps represent a major public health emergency. In camps, precarious living conditions contribute to the transmission of the vibrio. Among the major epidemics reported in camps, we note as well those which have affected Africa {{in the last two}} decades. These epidemics are characterized by high attack rates and high case fatality ratios. Attack rates {{in refugee camps}} can exceed 5 %. Appropriate control measures are adopted at international level. Actions carried out urgently must allow the proper supply of water, the control of excreta, and the improvement of general sanitary conditions and individual hygiene. Efficient management of cases in specialized cholera treatment centres (CTC) should decrease the case fatality ratio to less than 1 %. Treatment is mainly based on the prompt rehydration of patients. For wide camps, rapid access to oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>units</b> is essential. Availability of all necessary equipment in kit form is required...|$|R
40|$|In {{the first}} 2 years {{following}} refresher training of paediatric staff in oral rehydration therapy (ORT) {{and the establishment}} of an oral <b>rehydration</b> <b>unit</b> at the Kamuzu Central Hospital, Lilongwe, Malawi, there was a 50 % {{decrease in the number of}} children admitted to the paediatric ward with the diagnosis of diarrhoeal diseases, a 56 % decrease in the use of intravenous fluid to rehydrate such children, a threefold increase in the use of oral rehydration salts (ORS) exclusively to rehydrate children with mild or moderate dehydration, and a 39 % decrease in the number of paediatric deaths associated with diarrhoeal diseases. Over the same period, there was a 32 % decrease in recurrent hospital costs attributable to paediatric diarrhoeal diseases. As use of ORT continues to increase in Malawi, where diarrhoeal diseases account for 9 % of paediatric hospital admissions, there should be considerable decreases in mortality from such diseases and concomitant increases in cost savings attributable to them...|$|E
40|$|Background: Undernutrition {{contributes}} to 45 % of all deaths in children < 5 y of age worldwide, {{with a large}} proportion of those deaths caused by diarrhea. However, no validated tools exist for assessing undernutrition in children with diarrhea and possible dehydration. Objective: This study aimed to assess the validity of different measures of undernutrition in children with diarrhea. Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted at an urban hospital in Bangladesh. Children < 60 mo of age presenting to the hospital <b>rehydration</b> <b>unit</b> with acute diarrhea were eligible for enrollment. Study staff randomly selected 1196 children for screening, of which 1025 were eligible, 850 were enrolled, and 721 had complete data for analysis. Anthropometric measurements, including weight-for-age z score (WAZ), weight-for-length z score (WLZ), midupper arm circumference (MUAC), and midupper arm circumference z score (MUACZ), were calculated pre- and posthydration in all patients. Measurements were evaluated for their ability to correctly identify undernutrition in childrenwith varying degrees of dehydration. Results: Of the 721 patients with full data for analysis, the median percent dehydration was 4 %. Of the 4 measures evaluated, MUACandMUACZ demonstrated 92 – 94 %agreement pre- and posthydration comparedwith 69 – 76 % forWAZ andWLZ. Although each 1 %change in hydration statuswas found to changeweight-for-ageby 0. 0895 z scores andweight-for-length by 0. 1304 z scores...|$|E
40|$|Background: Dehydration due to acute {{gastroenteritis}} (AGE) {{remains a}} {{leading cause of}} child death worldwide. The primary treatment is enteral rehydration. Children who fail a trial of oral fluids require rehydration in hospital, preferably via nasogastric tube. Traditionally, children have been rehydrated over 24 hours; 'Standard Rehydration' (SR). Most treatment guidelines now recommend 'Rapid Rehydration' (RR) over 4 - 6 hours. There are limited data comparing RR to SR, especially from low-resource settings. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and efficiency of RR in children with AGE in the <b>Rehydration</b> <b>Unit</b> of Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital, Cape Town. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed. The intervention cohort contained 67 children who received RR in March 2007. The control cohort contained 76 children who received SR in March 2006. The outcome measures were weight and hydration status at 4 hours and time to maximum weight to measure efficacy; and length of hospital stay (LOS) to measure efficiency. Results: Children in the intervention cohort experienced greater weight gain (p< 0. 01) and lower dehydration scores (p= 0. 01) at 4 hours. There was no difference in time to maximum weight. The LOS for the two groups were not statistically different. Conclusion: RR is an effective method of rehydrating children with AGE. In contrast to two studies in well-developed settings, reduction in LOS following RR could not be demonstrated. There is no reason not to adopt RR as the predominant rehydration method in settings such as ours. More research is required to evaluate the efficiency of RR...|$|E
40|$|Although {{dehydration}} from diarrhea is {{a leading}} cause of morbidity and mortality in children under five, existing methods of assessing dehydration status in children have limited accuracy. To assess the accuracy of point-of-care ultrasound measurement of the aorta-to-IVC ratio as a predictor of dehydration in children. A prospective cohort study of children under five years with acute diarrhea was conducted in the <b>rehydration</b> <b>unit</b> of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b). Ultrasound measurements of aorta-to-IVC ratio and dehydrated weight were obtained on patient arrival. Percent weight change was monitored during rehydration to classify children as having "some dehydration" with weight change 3 - 9 % or "severe dehydration" with weight change > 9 %. Logistic regression analysis and Receiver-Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the accuracy of aorta-to-IVC ratio as a predictor of dehydration severity. 850 children were enrolled, of which 771 were included in the final analysis. Aorta to IVC ratio {{was a significant predictor of}} the percent dehydration in children with acute diarrhea, with each 1 -point increase in the aorta to IVC ratio predicting a 1. 1 % increase in the percent dehydration of the child. However, the area under the ROC curve (0. 60), sensitivity (67 %), and specificity (49 %), for predicting severe dehydration were all poor. Point-of-care ultrasound of the aorta-to-IVC ratio was statistically associated with volume status, but was not accurate enough to be used as an independent screening tool for dehydration in children under five years presenting with acute diarrhea in a resource-limited setting...|$|E
