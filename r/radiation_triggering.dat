40|$|Ionising {{radiation}} induces {{different and}} diverse effects in cells. Early and late response genes are {{induced by the}} radiation stress. The signal transduction for genes regulated by ionising radiation involves the activation of different kinases. However, the localisation of the triggering elements for the regulation of genes after ionising radiation has not been characterised. The aim of this thesis was to localise and identify elements responsible for the regulation of genes after low level ionising radiation. Different radiolabelled chemicals were employed to target different cellular compartments. Tritiated thymidine, " 1 " 2 " 5 I-concanavalin A and tritiated water were employed to irradiate the nucleus, membrane and whole cell, respectively. Compared to whole cell irradiation, nuclear irradiation at low doses (0. 5 h at 0. 075, 0. 4 Gy/h) resulted in preferential regulation of c-fos and c-myc proteins over their encoding mRNA. On the other hand, membrane irradiation at much higher doses (0. 5 h at 6. 8 Gy/h) only resulted in the induction of c-fos transcripts. The results in this thesis propose a distinctive role for the different cellular compartments in the regulation of genes at different levels after ionising <b>radiation.</b> <b>Triggering</b> of the regulatory mechanisms for the regulation of different genes could be controlled by elements in different cellular compartments. Furthermore, the sensitivity and effectiveness of the nucleus in regulating genes and inducing cell death after ionising radiation is unequivocally evident. Nonetheless, the transcriptional regulation of NF-#kappa#B (1. 9 fold) after low membrane doses (0. 5 h at 0. 25 Gy/h) suggests the presence of some sensitive elements in the cellular membrane. Damage to membrane elements is also implicated in the apoptotic processes responsible for cell lethality after membrane irradiation (LD_ 5 _ 0 = 80. 19). These results have implications for radiation induced carcinogenesis and mutation after low level ionising radiation.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of a prolate cloud at an H II boundary is investigated using smoothed particle hydrodynamics. The prolate molecular clouds in our investigation are set with their semi-major axis perpendicular to the radiative direction of a plane-parallel ionizing extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux. Simulations on three high-mass prolate clouds reveal that EUV <b>radiation</b> can <b>trigger</b> distinctive high-density core formation embedded in a final linear structure. This contrasts with results of the previous work in which only an isotropic far-ultraviolet interstellar background flux was applied. A systematic investigation {{on a group of}} prolate clouds of equal mass but different initial densities and geometric shapes finds that the distribution of the cores over the final linear structure changes with the initial conditions of the prolate cloud and the strength of the EUV radiation flux. These highly condensed cores may either scatter over the full length of the final linear structure or form two groups of high-density cores at two foci, depending on the value of the ionizing radiation penetration depth dEUV, the ratio of the physical ionizing radiation penetration depth to the minor axis of the cloud. Data analysis on the total mass of the high-density cores and the core formation time finds that the potential for EUV <b>radiation</b> <b>triggered</b> star formation efficiency is higher in prolate clouds with shallow ionization penetration depth and intermediate major-to-minor axial ratio, for the physical environments investigated.

Radiation-induced tumor cell death has been studied extensively in vitro and is widely attributed to multiple distinct mechanisms, including apoptosis, necrosis, mitotic catastrophe, autophagy, and senescence, which may occur concurrently. When considering tumor cell death {{in the context of an}} organism, an emerging body of evidence suggests there is a reciprocal relationship in which radiation stimulates the immune system, which in turn contributes to tumor cell kill. As a result, traditional measurements of radiation-induced tumor cell death, in vitro, fail to represent the extent of clinically observed responses, including reductions in loco-regional failure rates and improvements in metastases free and overall survival. Hence, understanding the immunological responses to the type of radiation-induced cell death is critical. In this review, the mechanisms of radiation-induced tumor cell death are described, with particular focus on immunogenic cell death. Strategies combining radiotherapy with specific chemotherapies or immunotherapies capable of inducing a repertoire of cancer specific immunogens might potentiate tumor control not only by enhancing cell kill but also through the induction of a successful anti-tumor vaccination that improves patient survival...|$|R

Several {{studies have shown}} that 125 I seeds radiation exerts anticancer activity by triggering DNA damage. However, recent evidence shows mitochondrial quality to be another crucial determinant of cell fate, with mitophagy playing a central role in this control mechanism. Herein, we found that 125 I seeds irradiation injured mitochondria, leading to significantly elevated mitochondrial and intracellular ROS (reactive oxygen species) levels in HCT 116 cells. The accumulation of mitochondrial ROS increased the expression of HIF- 1 α and its target genes BINP 3 and NIX (BINP 3 L), which subsequently triggered mitophagy. Importantly, 125 I seeds radiation induced mitophagy promoted cells survival and protected HCT 116 cells from apoptosis.

Therefore, we further investigated the mechanism by which <b>radiation</b> <b>triggers</b> autophagy in caspase- 3 / 7 deficient cells, and found the involvement of Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress. The ER activates a survival pathway, the unfolded protein response, which involves ER-localized transmembrane proteins PERK, IRE 1, and ATF 6. In this study, we found that PERK is essential for radiation-induced autophagy and radiosensitivity in caspase- 3 / 7 double-knockout cells. Irradiation of these cells increased expression of phosphorylated-elf 2 α. Similar results were seen following administration of tunicamycin (TM), a well known ER stressor.

By inhibiting cyclin-dependent kinases, p 16 activates the G 1 -S checkpoint, and this response is often considered to be critical for establishing a senescence-like growth arrest. Not all studies support a universal role for p 16 in senescence. Single-cell analysis of noncancerous human fibroblast cultures undergoing senescence as a function of culture age (replicative senescence) has revealed that p 16 is not expressed in the majority (> 90 %) of cells that exhibit features of senescence (e. g., flattened and enlarged morphology coupled with senescence-associated β-galactosidase expression), ruling out a requirement for p 16 in this process.
