5|$|Noether spoke quickly—reflecting {{the speed}} of her thoughts, many said—and demanded great {{concentration}} from her students. Students who disliked her style often felt alienated. Some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics, especially since her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together.|$|E
5|$|On {{their way}} home the AIF team played ten matches in South Africa, eight of them first-class, {{remaining}} undefeated in {{this section of the}} tour. While Jack Gregory <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> conditions, the local newspapers acclaimed Collins as the finest player in the touring team. Collins scored 602 runs in South Africa at an average of 50.58 and took 39 wickets at 16.53. In a match at the Old Wanderers ground in Johannesburg against the South African XI, Collins scored 235 from a total of 441 in the first innings as the AIF XI won by 8 wickets.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{with this}} momentum, Hoffman {{appeared}} in five films in 1998. He had supporting {{roles in the}} crime thriller Montana and the romantic comedy Next Stop Wonderland, {{both of which were}} commercial failures, before working with the Coen brothers in their dark comedy The Big Lebowski. Hoffman had long been a fan of the directors, and <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> experience of working with them. Appearing alongside Jeff Bridges and John Goodman, Hoffman played Brandt, the smug personal assistant of the titular character. Although it was only a small role, he claimed it was one for which he was most recognized, in a film that has achieved cult status and a large fan base. Between March and April 1998, Hoffman made 30 appearances on stage at the New York Theatre Workshop in a production of Mark Ravenhill's Shopping and Fucking, portraying an ex-heroin addict.|$|E

25|$|The {{content of}} McReynolds's {{proposal}} {{and the bill}} later submitted by Roosevelt were so similar to each other that it is thought the most probable source of the idea. Roosevelt and Cummings also <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to hoist McReynolds by his own petard. McReynolds, having been born in 1862, {{had been in his}} early fifties when he wrote his 1914 proposal, but was well over seventy when Roosevelt's plan was set forth.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Blake shared Dante's {{distrust}} of materialism and the corruptive nature of power, and clearly <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> opportunity {{to represent the}} atmosphere and imagery of Dante's work pictorially. Even as {{he seemed to be}} near death, Blake's central preoccupation was his feverish work on the illustrations to Dante's Inferno; he is said to have spent one of the very last shillings he possessed on a pencil to continue sketching.|$|E

25|$|Kaufmann <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> {{attention}} and became more demanding. Fassbinder bought Kaufmann four Lamborghinis {{over the period}} of a year; Kauffmann wrecked one and sold the others if they failed to meet his expectations. The relationship {{came to an end}} when Kaufmann became romantically involved with composer Peer Raben. After the end of their relationship, Fassbinder continued to cast Kaufmann in his films, albeit in minor roles. Kaufmann appeared in fourteen of Fassbinder's films, with the lead role in Whity (1971).|$|E
25|$|Meston <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> upending of {{cherished}} Western fiction clichés {{and felt}} that few Westerns gave any inkling of how brutal the Old West was in reality. Many episodes were based on man's cruelty to man and woman, inasmuch as the prairie woman's life and the painful treatment of women as chattels were touched on well ahead {{of their time in}} most media. As originally pitched to CBS executives, this was to be an adult Western, not a grown-up Hopalong Cassidy.|$|E

25|$|At {{around this}} time in his life, John Beckett recollected a journey to the Great Blasket Island, off {{the west coast of}} Ireland, which was made in a currach over a rough sea during the 1940s, when the island was still inhabited. He enjoyed the {{experience}} of living and drinking with the locals in their rough cottages and listened to the traditional music and songs that they performed. He <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> earthiness of plain, simple Mediterranean ceramics and loved Byzantine icons (especially those darkened with age).|$|E
25|$|The Arizona Supreme Court {{affirmed the}} {{conviction}} and sentence. With {{respect to the}} finding that the murder was committed in an especially heinous, cruel, or depraved manner, the court observed that under its prior case law, the murder was cruel in light of the evidence that Powell had some uncertainty as to his ultimate fate, and the murder was depraved in light of the evidence that Walton had <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> killing. Reviewing the death sentence independently, it found that the death sentence was appropriate on these facts.|$|E
25|$|To {{compose the}} film score, Burton brought in Danny Elfman, who had {{previously}} composed the music for Forbidden Zone. He <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to compose an orchestral score rather than a pop score and wanted to it to be taken {{as the work of}} a composer rather than the dabbling of a pop musician. Elfman already had the main title theme written before he signed on. At the time, Elfman was the lead singer of Oingo Boingo, but the working relationship between Burton and Elfman would overshadow his performing life and continue for most of Burton's films.|$|E

25|$|Australian losses {{amounted}} to seven killed and six wounded while 12 Japanese {{were killed and}} 26 were wounded in the assault. Japanese casualties included Ogawa, {{who was killed in}} the final stages of the fighting by the small Australian rearguard. For his actions during the engagement, Owen was posthumously bestowed the US Distinguished Service Cross, becoming the first Australian to receive this decoration. In withdrawing from Kokoda, the Australians had carried what equipment they could, but had left behind a large number of grenades, five machine guns and 1,850 rounds of rifle ammunition. The Japanese troops, who were issued with inferior grenades that had to be struck on the ground to prime, <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> find.|$|E
25|$|Paulo Portas {{showed a}} {{precocious}} interest {{in politics and}} as a child engaged in lively political discussions with his elders. In 1975 he joined the youth wing of the Democratic Popular Party (PPD), which in 1976 became PSD Social Democratic Party. He would later profess {{to have been a}} staunch follower of PPD's founder Francisco Sá Carneiro, who is said to have <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> views of the 14-year-old Paulo Portas and personally sponsored his full PSD membership in 1978. Sá Carneiro died in 1980 and, following a bitter loss in an internal election of the party's youth-wing JSD, Portas quietly left PSD in 1982. He remained involved with politics through his popular opinion-columns in the conservative weekly newspapers O Tempo and Semanário.|$|E
25|$|Back in Sydney for {{the autumn}} of 2000, Sunline powered through the rain-affected {{going to win the}} Apollo Stakes (1,400 metres) first-up. Remarkably, in her entire career, she was never beaten over the distance. She then carried the maximum topweight (60 {{kilograms}}) to win the first of two Coolmore Classics - at the time, Australia's only Group One race for fillies and mares (three years and over). At her next start, she carried 57.5 kilograms (9 st. 1lb.) in the Doncaster Handicap and was narrowly defeated by the lightly weighted three-year-old Over. Meeting again a week later, in the All-Aged Stakes, Sunline <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> return to weight for age conditions - easily accounting for Georgie Boy, with Over in third place, to make it three wins from four starts this campaign.|$|E

25|$|Nearly each summer, Maria, Alexander {{and their}} {{children}} would make an annual trip to Denmark, where her parents, King Christian IX and Queen Louise, hosted family reunions. Maria's brother, King George I, and his wife, Queen Olga, would come up from Athens with their children, and the Princess of Wales, often without her husband, would come with some of her children from England. In contrast to the tight security observed in Russia, the tsar, tsarina {{and their children}} <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> relative freedom that they could enjoy at Bernstorff and Fredensborg. The annual family meetings of monarchs in Denmark was regarded as suspicious in Europe, where many assumed they secretly discussed state affairs. Bismarck nicknamed Fredensborg “Europe’s Whispering Gallery” and accused Queen Louise of plotting against him with her children. Maria also had {{a good relationship with}} the majority of her in-laws, and was often asked to act as a mediator between them and the tsar. In the words of her daughter Olga: “She proved herself extremely tactful with her in-laws, which was no easy task”.|$|E
25|$|During {{his life}} at Rome, {{although}} he never {{rose to a}} position of real independence, and had always a hard and close struggle with poverty, he seems to have known everybody, especially every one of any eminence at the bar or in literature (friend to all). In addition to Lucan and Quintilian, he numbered among his manifold friends or more intimate acquaintances Silius Italicus, Juvenal, the younger Pliny; and there were many others of high position whose society and patronage he <b>relished.</b> <b>The</b> silence which he and Statius, although authors writing at the same time, having common friends and treating often of the same subjects, maintain in regard to one another may (nay must certainly) be explained by mutual dislike or want of sympathy or healthy rivalry or simple disgust. Martial in many places shows an undisguised contempt for the artificial kind of epic on which Statius's reputation chiefly rests; and it seems quite natural in the mind of an eminent litteraturist that the respectable author of the Thebaid and the Silvae should feel little admiration, nay perhaps even outright contempt, for either the life or the works of the populist and unsophisticated bohemian epigrammatist.|$|E
25|$|For {{the cost}} of twelve {{aircraft}} (four Ju 87s), he helped attack French communication and supply positions, and supported Reichenau {{as he reached the}} Dyle river. At that time, he had moved into the Netherlands, at a Hotel, near Maastricht. He had a basic room, with a bath that did not work. In the afternoon, he received an order to cease operations in Belgium, and send all he had to support Georg-Hans Reinhardt's XLI Corps, north of Sedan. Richthofen was incredulous, and he had to move his entire infrastructure 100 kilometres to the south. The failure of the OKL to inform him he was to support the breakthrough is difficult to explain. He later noted in his diary that it was a major oversight for the OKL not to have informed him of his expected input, but his diary also suggests he <b>relished</b> <b>the</b> fog of war and the unknown. His forces were split, with LG 1 and StG 2 continuing support in Belgium, while most were moved south. During the winding down of operations in the north, his units did help the Sixth Army capture Liege in Belgium on 17 May.|$|E
