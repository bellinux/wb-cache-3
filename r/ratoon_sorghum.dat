40|$|A {{total of}} 13 species of shootflies from two genera, Atherigona and Acritochaeta, were reared over a {{four-year}} period {{from a range}} of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) cultivars showing typical ‘dead heart’ symptoms. Atherigona soccata Rond. was the dominant species (< 99 % of the flies reared), while the second most common species was Acritochaeta orientalis Schin. An interesting record was Atherigona eriochloae Mall. reared from tillers of <b>ratooned</b> <b>sorghum.</b> Three species as yet undescribed were recorded. More females than males were reared {{in the course of the}} study — the sex ratio was 1 : 1. 27.

40|$|International audienceAbstractThe {{management}} of staple crops as perennials {{is a historic}} legacy and a present-day strategy in some regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, yet perenniality is rarely an agronomic subject. Farmers in Malawi cut annual crops, such as pigeonpea and sorghum, to extend production {{for more than one}} growing season. Cassava, a perennial food crop, has a proven track record of abating hunger. Here we review ratooning, as well as the historic role of perennial staple crops in Malawi. Ratooning is a method of harvesting a crop which leaves the roots and the lower parts of the plant uncut to give the ratoon or the stubble crop. This review is completed with interviews with Malawian farmers. The major points follow. The {{management of}} staple crops as perennials is underserved by research. Indeed, we retrieved only 86 references on <b>ratooning</b> <b>sorghum</b> and pigeonpea. Of these, 9  % and 19  % respectively were from the African continent. The literature and interviews indicate that pigeonpea and sorghum have high productive potential when well managed in ratoon systems. Thirty-five percent of interviewee responses that supported ratooning mentioned saving seed. Other primary reasons to ratoon include stimulating regrowth (30  %) and saving labor (20  %). However, 31  % of responses that were against ratooning cited increased disease potential, as well as excessive vegetative regrowth (18  %) ...|$|R

40|$|A three-year {{study on}} the {{practice}} of <b>ratooning</b> of <b>sorghum</b> was conducted in Eastern Kenya (1999 to 2002), with emphasis on the stem borer (Chilo partellus) and covered kernel smut (Sporisorium sorghi Ehrenberg Link). Ratooning is the practice of stimulating tillering by cutting the old straw after harvest (Doggett, 1988). A six season on-station experiment in Machakos District showed the practice of <b>ratooning</b> short duration <b>sorghum</b> increased the reliability and yields in comparison to a direct sown with yield ranges of 1630 - 1778 kg/ha and 0 - 148 kg/ha, respectively. The higher number of heads and stems per unit area meant the ratooned crop had higher level of stem borers per unit area than the direct sown crop and when infected with covered kernel smut was a greater source of inoculum. Unlike the incidence of CKS, the number of stem borers had little correlation with the numbers in the previous season’s crop; there was no upward trend {{to the number of}} stem borers per stem during the experiment suggesting factors other than the presence of a sorghum crop have a stronger influence on the population. Yield loss was an interaction between cultivar*incidence of stem borers * stage of infestation * rain quantity and distribution, but rain was the most important factor. An on-station trial in Kitui (2001 - 2) found the ratooned crop outperformed the direct sown crop in yield by a factor of three and non-cutting of stems produced a similar yield to cutting back stems after harvest. The different ‘ratoon’ methods did not significantly affect the incidence of covered kernel smut or level of stem borers. On-farm trials in Mwingi District (2000 - 2) showed that short duration <b>sorghum</b> <b>ratooned</b> outperformed direct sown sorghum. The timing of the cutting back of the stems had an effect on plant survival and yield; cutting back stems at harvest produced higher yields than cutting the stems at the on-set of rains, however cutting the stems at the onset of rains increased plant survival when the stems were dry at harvest. A decision tree was produced outlining the decisions a farmer needs to make when deciding whether or not to practice ratooning. Four factors were identified as important for varieties to perform well under the practice of ratooning: drought tolerance, stem strength, non-senescence and the ability to produce tillers during growth stage 3...|$|R
40|$|A three-year {{experiment}} {{examined the}} possibility of increasing the cropping intensity of a medium-deep Alfisol (red soil) by using sequential, relay, ratoon or intercropping systems. It was found that a short-season mungbean (Vigna radiata) crop could be taken before the commonly-grown castor crop but that castor yields were reduced by the delayed sowing. If the castor was sown after the harvest of mungbean in a sequential system the profits were less than from a sole castor system. Relay-sowing the castor 20 days before the harvest of mungbean gave 9 US ha− 1 greater profit than sole castor, but this is probably not enough to justify the more intensive double crop system. On the other hand a reasonable yield of horsegram (Macrotyloma uniflorum) could be produced after an early pearl millet crop, giving a worthwhile extra profit of 21 US ha− 1 compared with sole pearl millet. <b>Ratooning</b> the <b>sorghum</b> gave <b>ratoon</b> yields that averaged only 14...|$|R
40|$|Availability {{of manure}} {{nitrogen}} (N) to crops is mitigated by many factors including manure type and composition. Whereas relationships between dairy diets, milk production, manure N excretion, and urine N losses as ammonia have been documented, very little information exists on how diets impact fecal carbon (C), N content, and partitioning, {{and how these}} factors impact fecal N mineralization and plant N uptake after application to soil. Feces from 24 to 63 dairy cows (Bos taurus) fed 14 typical diets were incubated aerobically in a sandy loam and two silt loam soils, and soil inorganic N (IN) was determined periodically during a 365 -d period. Feces from 12 of the 14 diets were applied to the same soils and oat (Avena sativa L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), and <b>sorghum</b> <b>ratoon</b> dry matter (DM) and N uptake were determined over a 155 -d period. Feces from cows fed alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) silage (AS) -based diets generally lead to higher soil IN levels than soils amended with feces from corn (Ze...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the nutritive value and productivity of Sweet Potato Vines (SPV) and Sorghum Silage (SS) as feeds for dairy production in the dry highlands of Kenya during the years 2002 and 2003. Data on yield parameters of SPV and SS were collected. Both On-centre and on-farm work involved evaluation of milk production by dairy cattle fed on varying proportions of SPV with SS while demonstration and popularisation of SPV and SS utilization technologies were conducted on farms. Mean grain and dry matter (DM) yields of sorghum were 5. 5 and 23 t ha - 1, respectively. The Dry Matter (DM), Crude Protein (CP), Neutral Detergent Fibre (NDF) and Acid Detergent Lignin (ADL) contents of SS were 308, 60. 3, 622 and 61. 6 g kg - 1, respectively. Corresponding values of SPV were 160, 131, 341 and 64. 5 g kg - 1. Average daily milk yield was 3. 44 l day - 1 when SS alone was fed dairy cows and the yield was 26 l day - 1 when a combination of SPV, SS and home made dairy meal was supplied. Improved and sustained milk production in most of the farms was observed when <b>sorghum</b> <b>ratoon</b> was fed as green chop alongside SS especially during the dry season. This showed that sorghum fed together with SPV had great potential in enhancing milk production...|$|R

Cavalcade hay was 15 % of chopped sorghum fresh weight and cassava chips were added at 0, 5, 10 and 15 % of chopped sorghum fresh weight. The first experiment utilized sorghum and Cavalcade main crops and the second used the <b>ratoon</b> crop of <b>sorghum</b> and 2 nd cut of Cavalcade. Dry matter percentage of ensiled mixtures and silages increased (P< 0. 05) {{with an increase in}} cassava chip levels in both experiments, but CP and NDF concentrations decreased (P< 0. 05). Dry matter degradability increased (P< 0. 05) with an increase in cassava chip levels up to 10 % in both main and ratoon/ 2 nd cut silages. Digestible energy and metabolizable energy of both silages increased significantly with an increase in cassava chip levels up to 10 % for main crop and 15 % for ratoon/ 2 nd cut crops. While addition of cassava chips improved digestibility and energy content of silage, it lowered CP concentration. Use of fresh Cavalcade instead of hay should increase the CP levels and should be investigated along with animal feeding studies to test acceptance and animal performance...|$|R
