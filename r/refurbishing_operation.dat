40|$|Disassembly is a {{key element}} for {{retrieving}} the desired subassemblies and/or parts from a product. However, determining an efficient disassembly sequence plan (DSP) is an NP-complete problem. In this paper, we propose a methodology to generate a near optimum DSP for a product. The methodology is illustrated using an example. INTRODUCTION Product recovery and waste management techniques are in popular demand as key elements of Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing as a result of fast depletion of virgin resources and increasing amount of waste [2], [4]. Product recovery generally offers two major options: recycling and remanufacturing. Recycling aims to recover the material content of retired products by performing the necessary disassembly, sorting, and chemical operations. Remanufacturing preserves the product's (or its part's) identity and performs the required disassembly, sorting, and <b>refurbishing</b> <b>operations</b> in order to bring the parts of the product to a desired level of quali [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Many {{retail product}} returns can be {{refurbished}} and resold, typically at a reduced price. The price {{set for the}} refurbished products affects the demands for both new and refurbished products, while the refurbishment and resale activities incur costs. To maximize profit, a manufacturer in a competitive market must carefully choose the proportion of returned products to refurbish and their sale price. We model the sale, return, refurbishment, and resale processes in an open queueing network and formulate a mathematical program to find the optimal price and proportion to refurbish. Examination of the optimality conditions reveals the different situations {{in which it is}} optimal to refurbish none, some, or all of the returned products. <b>Refurbishing</b> <b>operations</b> may increase profit or may be required to relieve a manufacturing capacity bottleneck. A numerical study identifies characteristics of the new product market and refurbished products that encourage refurbishing and some situations in which small changes in the refurbishing cost and quality provoke large changes in the optimal policy...|$|R
40|$|Through {{assistance}} from NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Dow Corning developed a strong, heat-protecting coating with applications {{in a variety}} of fields. Previously, NASA used silicate coatings that simply failed to adequately protect, which resulted in the frequent recoating of the damaged areas. The enormous expense of this repeat procedure led Kennedy's Materials Science Laboratory to investigate the possibilities of ablative-type coatings. The investigations resulted {{in the creation of a}} silicone ablative material known as the Dow Corning 3 - 6376 Fast Cure Elastomer. The new product, which does not require a primer coating, is a 100 percent silicone material. It is currently used in the automotive and aerospace industries and serves as an exceptional coating for engine compartment firewalls. Dow Corning's Fast Cure Elastomer has also proved to be an effective sealant. Moreover, it reduces the turnaround time for reuse of the launch structure because of fewer <b>refurbishing</b> <b>operations.</b> This means that NASA is not held up due to repairs when it comes time to launch another Shuttle. To date, the Agency has launched dozens of successful missions without the need for recoating...|$|R

40|$|We {{focus on}} the {{original}} equipment manufacturers (OEMs) who sell both new and refurbished products directly to consumers, such as a computer maker who sells products online. New products are produced according to a make-to-order policy while returned products will be refurbished and ready to ship to consumers immediately according to a make-to-stock policy. The open queueing network combines the demand functions of new and refurbished products with a generalized open queueing network that simulates the closed-loop supply chain including manufacturing, sales, return, evaluation, refurbishing and resale processes. A mathematical model is developed to find the optimal price and quantity of refurbished products. The results show the effects of several parameters on the optimal solutions;Examination of the optimality conditions reveals the different situations {{in which it is}} optimal to refurbish none, some, or all of the returned products. <b>Refurbishing</b> <b>operations</b> may increase profit or may be required to relieve a manufacturing capacity bottleneck. A numerical study identifies characteristics of the new product market and refurbished products that encourage refurbishing and some situations in which small changes in the refurbishing cost and quality provoke large changes in the optimal policy. Sensitivity studies reveal how the variability of times to manufacture and refurbish products affects the optimal policy. Categorizing returned products improves total profit by reducing the variability of refurbishing time. The study also illustrates the improvement of total profit when products are designed {{so that they can be}} refurbished multiple of times...|$|R

50|$|Verizon {{has also}} refused to repair the copper local loop or replace the local loop {{infrastructure}} with fiber {{in the event of}} storm damage. In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, Verizon refused to rebuild the copper local loop infrastructure in New York's Fire Island. Instead, Verizon planned on requiring their telephone customers in the affected area to use VoiceLink, a feature-limited service which delivers landline phone service over the Verizon Wireless network. The service has limitations, including an inability to use data-based services (such as DSL and caller ID). Public backlash resulted in Verizon reversing this decision, and announcing that it planned to offer FiOS on Fire Island. Other areas affected by the storm did not see such a resolution; Comcast subsequently took advantage of the situation by announcing that it had expanded and <b>refurbished</b> its <b>operations</b> across the Jersey Shore.|$|R

40|$|This thesis studies {{change during}} {{the twentieth century}} at the lower reaches of the Winnipeg River in eastern Manitoba Canada. The pulp and paper {{industry}} there is part of a global network of economic exchange. "Sustainable development" is popular in the industry and is promoted as economic development which does not impair the abilities of future generations of people to meet their needs. The first section explores discourse about "environment" and its relationship with value and utilization. Technological innovation and cultural development have helped create a wide gulf between human experience and the natural world. The section on landscape develops the idea that the built environment emerges or is imposed as a consequence of purposeful human activity and natural evolution. Three land use regimes were evaluated in terms of changing landscape organization. On the Sagkeeng First Nation Reserve landscape reorganization from 1941 to 1991 was due to maturation of succession from muskeg and willow to forest. The settlement pattern was closely connected to environmental factors. Clear evidence of the impact of cutting practices on forest organization was not found, due to unavailability of environmental information for the entire Forest Management Licence area. There was substantial alteration of landscape structure in the agricultural lands, particularly where drainage ditches and roads were constructed. This regime reflected the situation where many individuals made land use decisions on small plots of land. The third, contextual, portion of the thesis focused on distinct phases in the development and growth of industrial forestry. Three main threads run through the entire period: wood supply, energy to drive the process, and international competition. In each period those themes were embedded within broader societal events. In the 1920 s uncertainty over wood supply led to delays in construction. The company wanted to secure a wood supply in a marginally productive area and to block competing interests. After the Second World War, the widespread attempt to move the economy to consumer-oriented industry and the drive to electrify rural areas played an integral role in the paper industry of eastern Manitoba. In the 1980 s and 1990 s two important situations are juxtaposed: globalization of industry and finance, and widespread concern for the environment. Renewal of rights to exploit and manage the large timber limits now requires environmental impact studies and public hearings. Waste management, air and water pollution and recycling are regulated. The present economic climate of global competition and freer trade has made older smaller mills non-competitive. Within that climate, a group of investors and the labour unions negotiated a buyout of the operation from the parent corporation (Abitibi-Price). "Sustainable development" has been a cure-all. Its meaning is so nebulous that it invites a definition tailored to any situation. The new paper company, like corporations and government bodies around the world, can use concern for the environment and the ambiguity of the concept not only to survive but to garner funding to modernize and upgrade the facility. Due to the competitive nature of the industry, the end result will likely be the sale, in several years, of the publicly-funded <b>refurbished</b> <b>operation</b> to a large corporation.

40|$|The Linear Economy cannot {{any longer}} be {{sustained}} by the eco-system: virgin resources are limited and destined to terminate soon if the contemporary production and consumption model will be maintained. For this reason, {{in the last few}} years Circular Economy has become an increasingly discussed topic worldwide. Through the adoption of strategies that close-the-loop of the traditional linear production system, Circular Economy aims to find solutions that can create a balance between economy, society and environment. This study aims to provide a holistic overview on the main theories and strategies that can ease a business transition to a Circular Economy model, to analyse challenges and opportunities connected to this conversion and to present a concrete tool developed for this purpose. The Life Cycle Design theory is here discussed and contextualised within the furniture industry reality since this study has been executed in collaboration with IKEA, the company case study of this thesis. An academic and professional literature review have been performed in order to gather information about theory and practice related to the implementation of strategies needed by a Circular Economy: product disassembly, recovery, reuse, refurbish, recycle and remanufacturing. The professional literature reviewed point out that the implementation of a circular model can lead to economic advantages and growthâ€™s opportunities for manufacturers in various economic sectors. The implementation of Circular Economy in the furnitureÂ industry seems to be in its early stages and it mainly focus, with few exception, on recycling rather than on the more effective reuse, <b>refurbish</b> or remanufacturing <b>operations.</b> This study points out the two main issues that the furniture manufacturers need to solve in order to enable the implementation of more effective circular strategies: product disassembly and recovery. Furthermore, the need of an innovative and holistic approach is discussed with particular emphasis on the importance of a systemic thinking that enable organisation to create their own identity and objectives in relation to the Circular Economy model. The importance of a system that connects and coordinate the sustainable efforts and aims for new products and services is therefore highlighted, suggested and deeply considered in the development of the tool proposed. To conclude, a comparison between two IKEA products (the sofas SÃ¶derhamn and Knopparp) was performed to identify the role of the productsâ€™ design and development in relation with the implementation of a Circular Economy model. The products were briefly technically analysed and then a comparison between a linear and a circular end-of-life cycle scenario has been represented...|$|R
