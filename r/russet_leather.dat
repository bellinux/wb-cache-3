60|$|As {{it was in}} {{the middle}} of August, and the weather {{intensely}} hot, I hired a calesa for the journey. This is a two-wheeled carriage, resembling a cabriolet, but of the most primitive and rude construction; the harness is profusely ornamented with brass, and the horse's hend decorated with tufts and tassels and dangling bobs of scarlet and yellow worsted. I had for calasero, a tall, long-legged Andalusian, in short jacket, little round-crowned hat, breeches decorated with buttons from the hip to the knees, and a pair of <b>russet</b> <b>leather</b> bottinas or spatterdashes. He was an active fellow, though uncommonly taciturn for an Andalusian, and strode along beside his horse, rousing him occasionally to greater speed by a loud malediction or a hearty thwack of his cudgel.|$|E
60|$|The {{magistrate}} {{now considered}} it {{his duty to}} send a couple of constables to search the chamber of the accused {{in the house of}} his uncle. From this search they almost immediately returned with the well-known steel-bound, <b>russet</b> <b>leather</b> pocket-book which the old gentleman had been in the habit of carrying for years. Its valuable contents, however, had been abstracted, and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from the prisoner the use which had been made of them, or the place of their concealment. Indeed, he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter. The constables, also, discovered, between the bed and sacking of the unhappy man, a shirt and neck-handkerchief both marked with the initials of his name, and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim.|$|E
60|$|No gentleman were admitted, so Jo played male {{parts to}} her heart's content and took immense {{satisfaction}} {{in a pair}} of <b>russet</b> <b>leather</b> boots given her by a friend, who knew a lady who knew an actor. These boots, an old foil, and a slashed doublet once used by an artist for some picture, were Jo's chief treasures and appeared on all occasions. The smallness of the company made it necessary for the two principal actors to take several parts apiece, and they certainly deserved some credit for the hard work they did in learning three or four different parts, whisking in and out of various costumes, and managing the stage besides. It was excellent drill for their memories, a harmless amusement, and employed many hours which otherwise would have been idle, lonely, or spent in less profitable society.|$|E
5000|$|General Officer {{models were}} often {{engraved}} with the officer's name. Recipients included Generals Eisenhower, Bradley, Marshall, and Patton. Patton's Model 1908 was embellished with three (later four) {{stars on the}} grip panels to denote his rank. They were issued with a fine-grade leather holster, leather pistol belt with gold-metal clasp, rope pistol lanyard with gold-metal fittings, and leather two-pocket ammunition pouch with gold-metal fasteners. They came in <b>russet</b> or black <b>leather</b> (depending on service and regulations) and were made by ALPCO (Atchison Leather Products) or Hickock. A cleaning rod and two spare magazines were also included.Generals were issued the Model M in [...]380 ACP, until 1950, when supply ran out. At that point, they were substituted with [...]32 models until their replacement in 1972. The Pocket Hammerless {{was replaced by the}} M15 pistol made by Rock Island Arsenal in [...]45 ACP. Today, the Pocket Hammerless is manufactured by U.S. Armament, and is licensed by Colt.|$|R
6000|$|... "I seem just to {{live from}} letter to letter. It's ridic'lous," [...] {{she said to}} Cynthia once when the girl brought the mail in from the barn, where the men folks kept it till they had put away their horses after driving over from Lovewell with it. The trains on the branch road were taken off in the winter, and the post-office at the hotel was discontinued. The men {{had to go to}} the town by cutter, over a highway that the winds sifted half full of snow after it had been broken out by the ox-teams in the morning. But Mrs. Durgin had studied the steamer days and {{calculated}} the time it would take letters to come from New York to Lovewell; and, unless a blizzard was raging, some one had to go for the mail when the day came. It was usually Jombateeste, who reverted in winter to the type of habitant from which he had sprung. He wore a blue woollen cap, like a large sock, pulled over his ears and close to his eyes, and below it his clean-shaven brown face showed. He had blue woollen mittens, and boots of <b>russet</b> <b>leather,</b> without heels, came to his knees; he got a pair every time he went home on St. John's day. His lean little body was swathed in several short jackets, and he brought the letters buttoned into one of the innermost pockets. He produced the letter from Jackson promptly enough when Cynthia came out to the barn for it, and then he made a show of getting his horse out of the cutter shafts, and shouting international reproaches at it, till she was forced to ask, [...] "Haven't you got something for me, Jombateeste?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Tressilian and his guide {{had time}} enough to observe all these particulars, for they waited some space in the {{apartment}} ere the present master of the mansion at length made his appearance. Prepared as he was to see an inauspicious and ill-looking person, the ugliness of Anthony Foster considerably exceeded what Tressilian had anticipated. He was of middle stature, built strongly, but so clumsily as to border on deformity, and to give all his motions the ungainly awkwardness of a left-legged and left-handed man. His hair, in arranging which men at that time, as at present, were very nice and curious, instead of being carefully cleaned and disposed into short curls, or else set up on end, as is represented in old paintings, in a manner resembling that used by fine gentlemen of our own day, escaped in sable negligence from under a furred bonnet, and hung in elf-locks, which seemed strangers to the comb, over his rugged brows, and around his very singular and unprepossessing countenance. His keen, dark eyes were deep set beneath broad and shaggy eyebrows, and as they were usually bent on the ground, seemed {{as if they were}} themselves ashamed of the expression natural to them, and were desirous to conceal it from the observation of men. At times, however, when, more intent on observing others, he suddenly raised them, and fixed them keenly on those with whom he conversed, they seemed to express both the fiercer passions, and the power of mind which could at will suppress or disguise the intensity of inward feeling. The features which corresponded with these eyes and this form were irregular, and marked so as to be indelibly fixed on the mind of him who had once seen them. Upon the whole, as Tressilian could not help acknowledging to himself, the Anthony Foster who now stood before them was the last person, judging from personal appearance, upon whom one would have chosen to intrude an unexpected and undesired visit. His attire was a doublet of <b>russet</b> <b>leather,</b> like those worn by the better sort of country folk, girt with a buff belt, in which was stuck on the right side a long knife, or dudgeon dagger, and on the other a cutlass. He raised his eyes as he entered the room, and fixed a keenly penetrating glance upon his two visitors; then cast them down as if counting his steps, while he advanced slowly {{into the middle of the}} room, and said, in a low and smothered tone of voice, [...] "Let me pray you, gentlemen, to tell me the cause of this visit." ...|$|E
50|$|The uniform {{consists}} of an Olive Drab (OD-51) peaked cap with a <b>russet</b> <b>leather</b> visor, white linen spread-collared shirt with a black worsted wool tie, Olive Drab wool trousers, an olive-drab (OD-51) wool four-button tunic with leather belt, and russet-brown leather Type I (leather-soled) service shoes.|$|E
5000|$|In 1956 the Army {{went over}} to {{polished}} black leather boots instead of the traditional unpolished <b>russet</b> <b>leather</b> and the Army Green uniform (with Goldenlite Yellow on blue rank stripes) was adopted. As late as the early 1980s, older soldiers who had served prior to 1956 said {{they were in the}} [...] "brown boot" [...] Army.|$|E
50|$|By 1941, {{soldiers}} wore a wool {{flannel shirt}} and wool serge trousers {{in winter and}} a cotton khaki shirt and trousers in summer, both with ankle-length <b>russet</b> <b>leather</b> service shoes and OD canvas leggings, and often with the OD cotton M1941 Field Jacket. A blue denim fatigue uniform was gradually being replaced by a M1941 green HBT uniform; both were in two pieces.|$|E
5000|$|Changes to {{the rank}} {{structure}} were proposed almost immediately but did not start occurring until the next year. Sometime during late 1947 and early 1948, new chevron designs were tested at Bolling Air Force Base. The style preferred was the one used today, the inverted chevron. Air Force Chief of Staff General Hoyt Vandenberg approved the new chevron on 9 March 1948. A new Air Force [...] "Uxbridge Blue" [...] uniform and black leather replaced the US Army Air Corps Olive Drab uniform and <b>russet</b> <b>leather</b> in 1949. Air Force personnel were allowed to wear their old Army World War Two pattern uniforms and rank insignia until July, 1952. Recolored [...] "hash marks" [...] and Overseas Service Bars were worn on the uniform until 1957.|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, Dooney & Bourke {{branched}} {{out into the}} handbag business {{with the release of}} the Tack Case and the Equestrian Bag, both made from bridle leather. Along with their original purse,distributors such as Nordstrom, Brooks Brothers, and Saks Fifth Avenue, they opened The Company Store in Norwalk, Connecticut which sold among other things Dooney & Bourke Merchandise. In 1983, with the development of their famous All-Weather Leather (AWL) bag, the first AWL handbag collection was released featuring a duck logo with a <b>russet</b> <b>leather</b> trim. In 2006 and 2007, the [...] "Emma Bag," [...] a small oval sized bag named after Emma Roberts, was created. In 2007, Hayden Panettiere, an actress on the NBC television series Heroes, designed a new bag for Dooney & Bourke ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{first true}} modern combat boots in the US Army, officially titled [...] "Boots, Combat Service", were {{introduced}} {{in conjunction with the}} M-1943 Uniform Ensemble during World War II. They were modified service shoes, with an extended, rough-out or, more commonly, a smooth leather high-top cuff added. The cuff was closed using two buckles, allowing the boots to replace the existing service shoes and leggings worn by most soldiers with a more convenient and practical solution. The boots, and the service shoes they were made from, had a one piece sole and heel, made from molded synthetic or reclaimed rubber. These [...] "double buckle" [...] boots were worn through the Korean War as a substitute for the Boots, <b>Russet,</b> <b>Leather</b> Lace Up introduced in 1948. The first type of Combat Boots, or Combat Tropical boots were based on the [...] "buckle boot" [...] design and worn during the early parts of the Vietnam War.|$|E
5000|$|Female service dress {{went through}} an {{evolution}} of patterns {{over the course}} of the war years, however throughout the period the service uniforms both summer and winter generally consisted of the WAC pattern hat or women's garrison cap, suit coat (winter only for enlisted women), shirtwaist, four-in-hand tie, skirt, <b>russet</b> <b>leather</b> women's service shoes and hand bag. The women's olive drab wool [...] "Ike jacket" [...] was also worn as were women's service trousers. The colors essentially mirrored those of their male counterparts of corresponding rank in the equivalent service uniform although fabrics differed. There were also special off duty dresses of summer beige and winter tan. The new olive drab ANC uniforms were the same as those for WAC officers except for the ANC pattern hat and the ANC pattern handbag. The off duty dress was a separate ANC pattern in olive drab shade 51 or beige. The ANC beige summer service uniform with maroon trim was retained except that the tie was changed to maroon. Sage green fatigue uniforms of herringbone cotton twill for women, along with women's combat boots, field jackets and flight clothing, were manufactured by the U.S. Army during World War II. However, when women's versions of these items were not available, as was often the case during the war, men's issue items were used instead.|$|E
