5000|$|The {{vehicle was}} {{powered by a}} single-cylinder 833 cc four stroke engine. An {{innovation}} {{at the time was}} the use of a steel <b>rotating</b> <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> to deliver the power to the rear wheels in place of the Chain-drive mechanism that Peugeot had previously used. Replacing the drive chain with a drive shaft enabled the manufacturer to move the engine from its accustomed place behind the driver, and it was now positioned {{at the front of the}} car.

5000|$|The Peugeot Type 26 was {{produced}} from 1899 to 1902 by Peugeot. It {{was larger than}} the mainstream Peugeot range, available as a four-seater. But the Type 26 still used the traditional rear-engined layout and chain drive mechanism of Peugeot's earliest cars. By the time it went out of production in 1902, this layout had been rendered obsolete {{by the introduction of}} <b>rotating</b> steel <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> and front-engine configuration of the Peugeot Type 48.

50|$|The car {{had much}} in common with the company’s Type 63 from 1904, sharing its 2100 mm {{wheelbase}} with the shorter “63A” version of that car. The principal difference was the engine which on the Type 99 was a single cylinder unit of 1039 cc delivering a maximum of 9 hp. The position of the engine, ahead of the driver, followed what had by now become the Peugeot standard lay-out as did the transmission of power to the rear wheels by means of a <b>rotating</b> steel <b>drive</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|R
50|$|In a drive suspension, the knuckle has no spindle, {{but rather}} has a hub into which is affixed the {{bearings}} and <b>shaft</b> of the <b>drive</b> mechanism. The {{end of the}} drive mechanism would then have the necessary mounting studs for the wheel/tire and/or brake assembly. Therefore, the wheel assembly would <b>rotate</b> as the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> (or half-shaft) dictates.

5000|$|Because the magneto has {{low voltage}} output at low speed, {{starting}} an engine is more difficult. Therefore, some magnetos have an impulse coupling, a springlike mechanical linkage between {{the engine and}} magneto <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> which [...] "winds up" [...] and [...] "lets go" [...] at the proper moment for spinning the magneto shaft. The impulse coupling uses a spring, a hub cam with flyweights, and a shell. The hub of the magneto <b>rotates</b> while the <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is held stationary, and the spring tension builds up. When the magneto is supposed to fire, the flyweights are released {{by the action of}} the body contacting the trigger ramp. This allows the spring to unwind giving the rotating magnet a rapid rotation and letting the magneto spin at such a speed to produce a spark.|$|R

50|$|A {{line shaft}} {{is a power}} <b>driven</b> <b>rotating</b> <b>shaft</b> for power {{transmission}} that was used extensively from the Industrial Revolution until the early 20th century. Prior to {{the widespread use of}} electric motors small enough to be connected directly to each piece of machinery, line shafting was used to distribute power from a large central power source to machinery throughout a workshop or an industrial complex. The central power source could be a water wheel, turbine, windmill, animal power or a steam engine. Power was distributed from the shaft to the machinery by a system of belts, pulleys and gears known as millwork.|$|R

40|$|A wave {{augmented}} diffuser for a {{centrifugal compressor}} surrounds the outlet of an impeller that <b>rotates</b> on a <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> having an axis of rotation. The impeller brings flow in in an axial direction and imparts kinetic {{energy to the}} flow discharging it in radial and tangential directions. The flow is discharged into a plurality of circumferentially disposed wave chambers. The wave chambers are periodically opened and closed by a rotary valve such that the flow through the diffuser is unsteady. The valve includes a plurality of valve openings that are periodically brought {{into and out of}} fluid communication with the wave chambers. When the wave chambers are closed, a reflected compression wave moves upstream towards the diffuser bringing the flow into the wave chamber to rest. This action recovers the kinetic energy from the flow and limits any boundary layer growth. The flow is then discharged in an axial direction through an opening in the valve plate when the valve plate is rotated to an open position. The diffuser thus efficiently raises the static pressure of the fluid and discharges an axially directed flow at a radius that is predominantly below the maximum radius of the diffuser...|$|R

Substitution of composite material over the conventional steel material for <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> has increasing the advantages of design due to its high specific stiffness and strength. <b>Drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is {{the main component of}} drive system of an automobile. Use of conventional steel for manufacturing of <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> has many disadvantages such as low specific stiffness and strength. Conventional <b>drive</b> <b>shaft</b> is made up into two parts to increase its fundamental natural bending frequency.

Many methods are available at present for the design optimization of structural systems and these methods based on mathematical programming techniques involving gradient search and direct search. These methods assume that the design variables are continuous. But in practical structural engineering optimization, almost all the design variables are discrete. This is due to the availability of components in standard sizes and constraints due to construction and manufacturing practices.
