Patients with organic causes which may produce both epilepsy and psychosis were excluded. The epileptic psychosis ratio to epilepsy was 1 : 23 and the epileptic psychosis ratio to psychosis was 1 : 7 S. The mean age at the onset of epilepsy was 19. 4 years, while the mean age at the onset ol psychosis was 29 years and thus the mean duration of epilepsy at the onset of psychosis was 9. 4 years.
