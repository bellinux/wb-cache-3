25|$|Peru was reintegrated {{into the}} global {{economic}} system, and began to attract foreign investment. The sell-off of state-owned enterprises led to improvements in some service industries, notably local telephony, mobile telephony and Internet. For example, before privatization, a consumer or business had to wait up to 10 years to get a local telephone line installed by the state-run telephone company, {{at a cost of}} $607 for a <b>residential</b> <b>line.</b> A couple of years after privatization, the wait was reduced to just a few days. Peru's Physical land based telephone network had a dramatic increase in telephone penetration from 2.9% in 1993 to 5.9% in 1996 and 6.2% in 2000, and a dramatic decrease in the wait for a telephone line. Average wait went from 70 months in 1993 (before privatization) to two months in 1996 (after privatization). Privatization also generated foreign investment in export-oriented activities such as mining and energy extraction, notably the Camisea gas project and the copper and zinc extraction projects at Antamina.|$|E

We develop a method that performs nonlinear filtering on the received signal energy to mitigate multiuser interference (MUI); and we test it over time-hopping and direct sequence impulse radio ultrawideband signals. Simulations conducted over IEEE 802. 15. 4 a <b>residential</b> <b>line</b> of sight ultrawideband multipath channels indicate that non-linear filtering helps sustain range estimation accuracy {{in the presence of}} strong MUI.

40|$|Ranging {{requires}} {{detection of}} the first arriving signal component. The accuracy of time-ofarrival-based range estimation is greatly degraded {{in the presence of}} multi-user interference (MUI). We develop a method that applies a nonlinear filter on received signal energy to suppress multiuser interference. Then, leading signal path is tracked via an iterative search back algorithm. The method is tested on time-hopping impulse radio ultrawideband systems. Simulations conducted over IEEE 802. 15. 4 a <b>residential</b> <b>line</b> of sight ultrawideband multipath channels indicate that range detection accuracy is significantly improved by the proposed non-linear filtering approach IEEE International Conference on Ultra-Wideband (ICUWB...|$|E
40|$|The Solar Decathlon is a {{biennial}} Department of Energy (DOE) collegiate {{contest to}} “promote and speed to market” solar powered, residential homes (Grose, 2009). It {{is a student}} competition wherein twenty universities are selected to design, build, and showcase residential structures that would ultimately be relocated to a competition campus in West Potomac Park in Washington D. C. to be viewed {{by the general public}} and judged by representatives of the DOE. The challenge is “design, build, and operate solar-powered houses that are cost-effective, energy-efficient, and attractive” (DOE). The project structures are homes that are designed and built to conform to the parameters set forth by the DOE in an effort to showcase the use of solar power as a practical means of <b>residential</b> <b>line</b> voltage power supply. The projects are then judged according to how well they performed within those parameters. The challenges involved in the design and construction of a “net- zero” house, that is a house that produces at least as much electricity as it consumes, were formidable. Equally formidable were the technical/logistical issues inherent in designing and constructing a building that could be disassembled and transported. Finally, reconstructing a residential dwelling, complete in all respects, in the allotted time period of seven days created educational opportunities that mirror conditions the construction manager will face in his or her professional life. Multidiscipline work groups analyzed the architectural, structural, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, building controls, and photovoltaic performance requirements. These systems not only had to be integrated within each other, but they also had to work within a tight construction budget and build schedule. Those requirements are challenging enough on a normal construction project. Added to the complexity is that the INhome had to be built on the Purdue campus and then shipped to the competition site in Washington D. C. This paper highlights the process and strategies that Team Purdue utilized to design, build, operate, move, and successfully compete in the Solar Decathlon 2011 with a net zero home...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To analyze {{differences}} in sociodemographic characteristics associated with health in individuals {{with and without}} a <b>residential</b> telephone <b>line.</b> METHODS: Data from the ISA-Capital 2003 (2003 Health Survey), a study performed {{in the city of}} São Paulo, Southeastern Brazil, were analyzed. Residents who had a <b>residential</b> telephone <b>line</b> were compared to those who reported not having a telephone line, according to sociodemographic, lifestyle, health status and health service use variables. Bias associated with noncoverage of the population without a telephone line was estimated, decreasing after the use of post-stratifi cation adjustments. RESULTS: Of all the 1, 878 interviewees aged more than 18 years, 80. 1 % had a <b>residential</b> telephone <b>line.</b> By comparing groups, the main sociodemographic differences among individuals who did not have a <b>residential</b> telephone <b>line</b> were the following: younger age, greater proportion of black and mixed individuals, smaller proportion of married interviewees, and greater proportion of unemployed individuals with a lower level of education. Residents without a <b>residential</b> telephone <b>line</b> had fewer health tests performed and smoked and drank more. In addition, this group took less medication, considered themselves to be in worse health conditions and used the SUS (National Health System) more frequently. When excluding the population without a telephone line from the analysis, estimates of dental consultations, alcoholism, drug use and SUS use to have a Papanicolaou test performed were those showing the highest bias. After post-stratifi cation adjustment, there was a decrease in the bias of estimates for the variables associated with ownership of a <b>residential</b> telephone <b>line.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The exclusion of residents without a telephone line {{was one of the main}} limitations to the studies performed in this way. However, the use of statistical techniques of post-stratifi cation adjustment enables a reduction in non-coverage bias...|$|R
