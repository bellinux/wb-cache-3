40|$|The human skull {{undergoes}} significant growth {{within the}} first two years of life (Dahm et aI, 1992). Therefore, before children under two can be considered candidates for cochlear implantation, the effects of the surgical procedure on subsequent skull growth must be well understood. To evaluate the effects of implantation on skull growth four macaque monkeys were implanted with dummy cochlear implants at six months of age. To model the procedure in the very young child, the bed for the <b>receiver-stimulator</b> was drilled across a calvarial suture down to the underlying dura and an electrode array inserted into the scala tympani via a mastoidectomy and posterior,tympanotomy. Plain skull radiographs were perioqical 1 y taken to monitor skull growth for periods of up to three years following implantation. Their longitudinal measurements revealed no evidence of asymmetrical skull growth when compared with unimplanted control animals. Computer tomographic scans taken at post-mortem confirmed these findings. Finally, subsequent histopathological evaluation of the <b>receiver-stimulator</b> package bed indicated that it becomes obliterated by hard tissue, resulting in a localized flattening of the vault under the <b>receiver-stimulator.</b> However, this tissue exhibited histological evidence of sutures, indicating that the surgical procedure should not lead to premature sutural closure. In conclusion, the present experimental results suggest that long-term cochlear implantation in very young children will not lead to any significant skull deformity. Open Acces...|$|E

[URL] anatomy of the temporal bone was studied to determine the optimal shape and dimensions of a new <b>receiver-stimulator</b> for use in young children even less than 12 months of age. There was a need to make the <b>receiver-stimulator</b> electronic package smaller so that it could be placed within the mastoid cavity, and the antenna wider, for more efficient power and data transmission. The antenna needed to conform to the smaller radius of a young child's skull. Anatomic dissections were carried out on skulls of children from 3 to 11 months of age to establish the variations in dimensions relevant for implantation. Prototype implant designs were evaluated in these skulls and {{it was found that the}} maximum thickness the anterior section of the <b>receiver-stimulator</b> should be was 5. 5 mm, and its maximum width, 18 mm. It was found that a prototype electronics package with these dimensions could be fitted comfortably into the average skull of an 8 -month-old child. A particular constraint was the depth of the bone over the sigmoid sinus and middle fossa.

Anatomic studies of skull growth have shown an increase (about 20 mm) in {{the distance between the}} round window and the asterion where the <b>receiver-stimulator</b> is usually located. In order to accommodate the skull growth of young patients, an expandable leadwire connecting the <b>receiver-stimulator</b> and the electrode array is necessary. Several expandable leadwires were evaluated in experimental animals, including helical leadwires protected by Silastic tubes and leadwires, with "V" or "W"-shaped levels in a single phase, and protected by thin Silastic or Teflon bags. The leadwires together with their controls were implanted on young animal's scapulae, temporal and parietal bones and in subcutaneous tissue. The in vivo expansion of the leadwire was monitored by periodic x-ray examination and the force to expand the leadwire was measured at the completion of implantation. The results showed that helical leadwires weresurrounded by fibrous tissue and a large force was required to expand them. The V or W-shaped leadwires were able to expand up to 20 mm in vivo and only a moderate force was required to expand them. For most of the cases, there was none or little fibrous tissue in Silastic or Teflon bags. The results indicated that for a paediatric cochlear implant, leadwires with V or W-shaped levels could, expand and biocompatible envelopes could effectively protect the leadwires from being bound by fibrous tissue.

This is {{a review}} of research to develop the University of Melbourne/Nucleus cochlear prosthesis for patients with a profound-total hearing loss. A more complete review can be obtained in Clark et al. A prototype <b>receiver-stimulator</b> and multiple-electrode array developed at the University of Melbourne was first implanted in a postlingually deaf adult patient with a profound-total hearing loss on 1 August 1978. A speech processing strategy which could help this patient understand running speech, especially when combined with lipreading was developed in 1978 following initial psychophysical studies. A prototype wearable speech processor was fabricated in 1979, that could provide significant help {{for the first two}} patients in understanding running speech when used in combination with lipreading compared with lipreading alone, and it also enabled them to understand some running speech when using electrical stimulation alone. An implantable <b>receiver-stimulator</b> and wearable speech processor embodying the principles of the prototype devices were then produced for clinical trial by the Australian biomedical firm, Nucleus Ltd, and its subsidiaries, Cochlear Pty Ltd and Cochlear Corporation. This cochlear implant was initially clinically trialled on six patients at The Royal Victorian Eye & Ear Hospital in 1982, and shown to give similar results to those obtained with the prototype device. In view of these findings a clinical trial was carried out for a Premarket Approval Application to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and extended to a number of centres in the US, Canada, and West Germany. This clinical trial confirmed that patients could understand running speech when electrical stimulation was combined with lipreading, and that some patients could also understand running speech when using electrical stimulation alone.

[URL] stimulation of the auditory system to reproduce hearing commenced through academic curiosity, and the hope of helping deaf people. It received direction from neurophysiology, and later psychophysics and speech science. In the 1960 s and 1970 s there were many questions requiring answers before cochlear implants could become a practical reality. Key concerns were: (1) the cochlea was too complex for electrical stimulation to reproduce the coding of sound; (2) multiple electrodes inserted into the cochlea for the place coding of frequency could damage the auditory nerves to be stimulated; (3) speech was too complex to be reproduced by electrical stimulation; and (4) children born deaf would not develop the appropriate neural connectivity for speech understanding. The first questions were addressed on the experimental animal. Speech research on patients was only possible {{with the advent of}} silicon chip technology allowing the development of an implantable <b>receiver-stimulator</b> package. Initial research established proof of principle that connected discourse was possible with multiple electrode stimulation of the auditory nerve in severely and profoundly deaf people. The research has been developed industrially for the benefits to be provided on a widespread basis through clinics worldwide. Further research has resulted in continuing improvements so that the average profoundly deaf person can hear as well as someone with severe hearing loss using a hearing aid. There is still much research required to achieve high fidelity sound, hearing in noise, and totally implantable devices. Open Acces...|$|E

This results, however, in increased package dimensions which makes its placement and the design of the surgery more critical. This problem is increased by {{the fact that we have}} considered it important to be able to remove the package and replace it with another without disturbing the implanted electrode array, should the first <b>receiver-stimulator</b> fail or an improved design become available. This has meant the design of a special connector (Patrick, 1977; Clark et al., 1978) which adds to the dimensions of the implanted unit. In addition the placement of the coils for transmitting power and information has to be considered. Not only is it desirable to site the coils at a convenient location behind the ear to facilitate the placement and wearing of the external transmitter, but there should also be no relative movement between the coils and the electronic package. These design considerations have led to the sitting of the coils on top of the hermetically-sealed box, and further increased the height of the package.

The inner and middle cars were adult size at birth. The external auditory canal and most parts of the temporal hone were subject to significant lateral growth. The size of the pneumatised mastoid increased in all directions. In the facial recess, however, no postnatal growth was observed. Between birth and adulthood an average of 12 mm (SD 5 mm) of growth was seen directly between the sino-dural angle and the round window, the landmarks approximating the Implantation site for the <b>receiver-stimulator</b> and the electrode entry point into the inner car. However, if an electrode leadwire is fixed at a cortical fixation site such as the posterosuperior point of Macewen's triangle, the leadwire would be subject to approximately 20 mm of growth. These results indicate that a paediatric cochlear implant design incorporating an expandable leadwire to accommodate this growth should allow up to 25 mm of leadwire lengthening. The fossa incudis showed no growth relative to the round window and was found to be a convenient fixation site for the electrode array close to the cochlea. From an anatomical and surgical point of view, cochlear implantation in very young children is feasible, provided the electrode array is secured and the design accommodates for controlled leadwire lengthening.
