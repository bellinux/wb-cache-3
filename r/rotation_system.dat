5|$|Agricultural {{improvements}} {{beginning in}} the 17th century resulted in the enclosure of the commons and ultimately in the Victoria era the emergence of large and well-managed farms using a five-shift <b>rotation</b> <b>system</b> and producing high-quality beef cattle.|$|E
5|$|Advice on more {{productive}} techniques for farming {{began to appear}} in England in the mid-17th century, from writers such as Samuel Hartlib, Walter Blith and others. The main problem in sustaining agriculture in one place for a long time was the depletion of nutrients, most importantly nitrogen levels, in the soil. To allow the soil to regenerate, productive land was often let fallow and in some places crop rotation was used. The Dutch four-field <b>rotation</b> <b>system</b> was popularised by the British agriculturist Charles Townshend in the 18th century. The system (wheat, turnips, barley and clover), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing livestock to be bred year-round. The use of clover was especially important as the legume roots replenished soil nitrates.|$|E

Our {{interest}} in computer graphics motivates a revised study of graph <b>rotation</b> <b>systems,</b> which are constructs by which topological graph theorists specify {{the placement of}} graphs on surfaces, non-orientable as well as orientable. Whereas orientable imbeddings have been studied extensively, non-orientable imbeddings have been comparatively neglected. This study extends general <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> into a solid mathematical model {{for the development of}} an interactivegraphics cyclic-weaving system. This involves a systematic exploration and characterization of dynamic surgery operations on graph <b>rotation</b> <b>systems,</b> such as edge-insertion, edge-deletion, and edge-twisting, which are used within an interactive-graphics system for designing weavings. Some fundamental theoretical results for the model are derived.

5|$|The {{development}} of a three-field <b>rotation</b> <b>system</b> for planting crops increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system, with a consequent increase in production. The {{development of}} the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently, aided by {{the spread of the}} horse collar, which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen. Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture, factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Agronomy) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2008. A {{two year}} {{experiment}} (2004 - 2005) {{was conducted at}} the Tygerhoek Experimental Farm near Riviersonderend in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The effect of different crop <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> on soil properties, disease and insect pests, weed populations, wheat growth, yield and quality in the wheat crop phase, included in these crop <b>rotation</b> <b>systems,</b> was determined. This trial {{was part of a}} long term crop rotation experiment started in 2002. This trial was laid out as a block design with four replications. Crop <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> included wheat, barley, canola, lupins and pasture phases which consisted of medics and clovers planted collectively. Soil samples were taken at each replication for N-incubations for determination of mineral N (NO 3 - -N plus NH 4 + -N) at 0 - 150 mm soil depth. A basic soil chemical analysis was done at 0 - 150 mm and 150 - 300 mm soil depths, respectively. Each sub-plot (replication) consisted of a 3 m 2 block that was divided into a 1. 5 m 2 block for harvest and smaller 0. 25 m 2 blocks for samples that were taken at different growth stages throughout both seasons. Dry mass and nitrogen (N) content of different plant components, leaf area index, disease symptoms and pest damage were recorded from each sample. Trends in basic soil chemical properties mostly differed between crop <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> during different seasons while similar trends in soil mineral nitrogen occurred. Highest soil mineral N levels occurred after one or two consecutive years of pasture while levels after a lupin phase were disappointingly low in both seasons. These high soil mineral N levels showed similar trends to wheat grain quality and some wheat yields, while the most influencing factors on wheat grain yield were probably soil physical properties. Soil mineral N after canola was high during plant after which levels were much lower than many other crop <b>rotation</b> <b>systems.</b> This occurrence will probably need a re-evaluation of N fertilizing programs if the same trends are found in similar, but longer trials. Lolium spp. was the most prominent weed that occurred in both seasons at some crop <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> seemingly with no direct effect from crop rotation. Highest disease incidence mainly from Septoria spp. and Puccinia spp. occurred, particularly in wheat/wheat rotations, except for Puccinia which showed high ratings of disease symptoms in all crop rotations in the drier 2004 season. Lower ratings occurred in crop <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> when wheat was preceded by nonwheat crops. Insect pest damage showed no similar trends indicating no direct effect of crop rotation on these pests and/or effective control from applied pesticides in both seasons. It was concluded that climate {{was one of the most}} influencing factors affecting differences and seem to be the main cause for different trends found between these two seasons in similar crop <b>rotation</b> <b>systems.</b> A similar trial with longer duration than this one is thus needed to obtain conclusive trends. This also indicates the importance of integration of crop rotation and management practices that are most optimal during dry and wet seasons, thus limiting risk...|$|R

The comparative analysis of this effect in relation to alternative systems or practices is essential for a comprehensive appreciation in their merit. This field experiment was comprised of four three-year rotation cycles. Wheat (Triticum turgidum durum) was seeded for two consecutive years after common vetch (Vicia sativa L.), treated in three different ways, and after fallow and compared with three wheat monocultures: the conventional one, the continuous straw incorporation, and the sewage sludge incorporation once every three years. Wheat grain and straw yields and N uptake were compared among treatments. Results showed that <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> that included vetch were the most promising for improving sustainability. Maximum N uptake and the greatest yield surpluses were obtained when wheat followed vetch incorporated during flowering. When vetch in the rotation was cut for hay or left to fill grains subsequent wheat showed also enhanced yields. Fallow affected the <b>rotation</b> <b>system’s</b> fertility due to the incorporation of volunteer plants into the soil.

40|$|The alfalfa {{pastureland}} in the semiarid Loess Plateau {{region of}} Northwest China usually has dry soil layers. A field experiment was conducted from October 2000 to October 2004 to examine soil water recovery and crop productivity on a 9 -year-old alfalfa pasture. This experiment included six treatments: alfalfa pasture for 10 - 14 years, a conventional farming system without prior alfalfa planting, and four alfalfa-crop rotation treatments. For the rotation treatments, after 9 years of alfalfa selected crops were planted from 2001 to 2004 {{in the following}} sequence: (1) millet, spring wheat, potatoes, peas; (2) millet, corn, corn, spring wheat; (3) millet, potatoes, spring wheat, corn; (4) millet, fallow, peas, potatoes. The results showed that dry soil layers occurred in alfalfa pasture. We then plowed the alfalfa pasture and planted different crops. The soil water gradually increased during crop growth in the experimental period. The degree of soil water recovery in the four alfalfa-crop rotation treatments was derived from comparison with the soil water in the conventional system. After 4 years, the soil water recovery from the alfalfa-crop <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> at 0 - 500  cm soil depth was 90. 5 %, 89. 8 %, 92. 2 % and 96. 7 %, respectively. Soil total N content and soil respiration rate were high in the alfalfa-crop <b>rotation</b> <b>systems.</b> The yields of spring wheat in 2002, peas in 2003 and potatoes in 2004 in the alfalfa-crop <b>rotation</b> <b>systems</b> {{were not significantly different}} from yields in the conventional system. In the alfalfa-crop <b>rotation</b> <b>systems,</b> the yields of spring wheat and peas were greatly influenced by rainfall and were lowest in the dry year of 2004; the yields of corn and potatoes had a direct relationship with water use and were lowest in 2003. In summary, soil water in dry soil layers can recover, and crop yields in the alfalfa-crop systems were equal to those of the conventional system. ...|$|R
