5|$|The Pizza Burger is {{a burger}} sold {{exclusively}} at the BK Whopper Bar location in Times Square, New York City that {{was introduced in}} September 2010. It consists of four Whopper patties on a 9.5inch sesame bun, sliced into six pieces and topped with pepperoni, mozzarella, basil pesto and marinara sauce. The whole burger contains more than the <b>recommended</b> <b>daily</b> <b>allowance</b> of calories for men at 2,520 calories, with 144grams of fat, 59g of which is saturated, and 3,780mg of sodium, {{more than double the}} <b>recommended</b> <b>daily</b> <b>allowance</b> for adults. However, according to Burger King's Vice President of global marketing, John Schaufelberger, the burger is not intended to feed just one person. Each slice has 420 calories, 24g fat (10g saturated), and 630mg sodium.|$|E

The human ascorbic acid requirement cannot be calculated by a linear extrapolation from guinea pigs per kg of body weight because guinea pigs are much smaller than human beings and, hence, their metabolism is more rapid per unit of body weight.

50|$|The {{assessment}} of vitamin B6 status is essential, as the clinical {{signs and symptoms}} in less severe cases are not specific. The three biochemical tests most widely used are the activation coefficient for the erythrocyte enzyme aspartate aminotransferase, plasma PLP concentrations, and the urinary excretion of vitamin B6 degradation products, specifically urinary PA. Of these, plasma PLP {{is probably the best}} single measure, because it reflects tissue stores. Plasma PLP less than 10 nmol/l is indicative of vitamin B6 deficiency. A PLP concentration greater than 20 nmol/l has been chosen as a level of adequacy for establishing Estimated Average Requirements and <b>Recommended</b> <b>Daily</b> <b>Allowances</b> in the USA. Urinary PA is also an indicator of vitamin B6 deficiency; levels of less than 3.0 mmol/day is suggestive of vitamin B6 deficiency.|$|R

Dietary intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaire using 24 -Hours-Recall method for three consecutive days. Nutrition education was also imparted for 4 months.

Significant increase was observed in average intake of proteins, dietary fibre, n- 6 fatty acids, vitamins and minerals due to increase in average daily intake of pulses, sprouts, other vegetables, fruits, roots and tubers and less intake of fat and energy dense foods.

The rate of production of ascorbic acid, in mammals that synthesize it has been listed as 3 - 19 g/ 70 kg per day. If this high rate of synthesis represents the requirement of such animals, mutations that caused a loss of ascorbic-acid-synthesizing ability would be eliminated by natural selection on diets that failed to supply these large quantities. The loss of ascorbic-acid-synthesizing ability by human beings could indicate a low requirement, which has enabled our species to spread to regions of the earth where dietary sources of ascorbic acid are poor...|$|R

In total, 14 elements were analyzed, 13 (Ca, K, Mg, Na, Mn, Fe, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni, Co, Cd, and Pb) by flame atomic absorption spectrometry, and P by UV-Vis spectrometry, after mineralization of samples. It was found that K was the most abundant macroelement in the analyzed samples, whereas among microelements, the highest concentration was found for Mn.
