The device is small enough to be used with a 12 mm trocar sleeve and transmits sufficient torque to fully secure bone screws. The articulating joint enables correct screw alignment at obtuse angles, up to 60 ° from the tool axis. A novel articulating joint is presented, wherein a flexible shaft both transmits torque and actuates the joint; antagonist force is provided by a super-elastic spring. Screws are Joseph E Petrzelka MED- 10 - 1046 2 secured against the driver blade during insertion with a retention mechanism that passively <b>releases</b> the <b>screw</b> once it is securely seated in the bone.

In the 12th grade {{he got a}} job on the first street team for Houston radio station Majic 102. During his senior year Ron C earned a grant to attend Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, to study communication. He attended Wiley for a year and worked at the school-run radio station KBWC. After being there a year C took a lead at Houston urban station 97.9 The Box in promotions as an intern. In 1994 Ron C was given a paid position at KBXX 97.9 FM. That same year he met Michael “5000” Watts who was also a DJ at the station. On the south side of town a new subgenre of rap that had been created by DJ Screw was so popular that the sound was being played on the north side. Ron C teamed with Watts (who released “party tapes” which are called mixtapes today) to <b>release</b> a <b>screwed</b> and chopped tape of their own. In 1995, Swishahouse was founded as a joint venture between the two DJs. DJ Screw let south-side MCs rap on his tapes and the Swishahouse would soon do the same for rappers on the north side.|$|R

40|$|IONM is use to {{monitoring}} nervous tissues (including brain, spinal cord, cranial nerves and peripheral nerves) in real-time during surgeries, alert neurological injuries and corrective measures and prevent disability. There are various IONM monitoring techniques including evoke potentials (SSEP, BAEP, MEP), EMG (Free-running and triggered), NAP (Nerve action potential) and Electroencephalography (EEG) {{to monitor the}} functional integrity of neural structures. SSEP evaluates integrity of posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway. SSEP is clinical use in spinal cord surgeries, vascular surgeries (carotid endarterectomy, cerebral aneurysm surgery etc), and localization of sensor motor cortex. BAEP evaluates integrity of peripheral and central auditory pathway. BAEP is clinical use in CP angle tumors surgery (acoustic neuroma,meningioma), microvascular decompression of CN-VII for hemifacial spasm, CN-V for trigeminal neuralgia, CN-IX for glossopharyngeal neuralgia, skull base surgery, Suboccipital decompression (e. g. fractures/dislocation C- 1 vertebra, chiari malformation). MEP evaluates integrity of motor pathway. MEP is sensitive to neuromuscular blocker anesthetic medications. Clinical utility of MEP including any surgery risking motor pathway injury include tumor near the motor cortex or corticospinal tract, intracranial aneurysm clipping, posterior fossa surgery, tethered cord or cauda equina surgeries, spinal deformity or fracture surgery, vertebral tumor resections, and anterior cervical discectomy, descending aortic procedures, spinal arteriovenous malformation interventions and carotid endarterectomy.

Methods: Three commercially available screws for RME were tested: Leone A 2620; Dentaurum Hyrax; Forestadent Palatal Split Screw. All expansion screws were 10 mm in size. For the evaluation of mechanical properties, the screws for RME were adjusted using the same maxillary dental model. An Instron 3365 testing machine with a load cell of 5 kN recorded the forces <b>released</b> by the <b>screws</b> at different amounts of activation (1, 5, 10, 15 and 20 quarters of a turn). Each type of screw was tested 10 times. Comparisons between the forces released by the different types of screws at different amounts of activation were carried out by means of analysis of Kruskal-Wallis test with post-hoc test di Tukey (P < 0. 05). Results: The results of this study showed that all 3 expansion devices were able to develop forces that could produce a separation of the palatine processes. The Hyrax and A 2620 expanders developed force values over 20 kg and the Palatal Split screws about 16 kg.

The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and limitation of the reconstructions of the MPFL in single patellar and femoral bone tunnels. The methods used a hamstring tendon and titanium interference screws in patients with recurrent patellar dislocation. Nineteen knees in 17 patients were studied. Subjects underwent MPFL reconstruction with or without lateral <b>release</b> using interference <b>screws</b> in single patellar and femoral tunnels. Patients were evaluated using preoperative and postoperative physical and radiographic examinations, including apprehension testing, assessment of tilting and congruence angles, medial and lateral shift ratios under stress X-ray imaging, and Kujala and Lysholm scores. Average follow-up was 22  months (12 – 71  months). None experienced recurrent postoperative episodes of dislocation or subluxation. By the final follow-up, patellar apprehension had disappeared in all patients except for one with generalized joint laxity. In addition, patients showed significant improvement in the following areas: tilting angle (from 14. 4  ±  5. 6 ° to 6. 4  ±  4. 6 °, p <  0. 0001), congruence angle (0. 5  ±  16 ° to − 9. 2  ±  6. 9 °, p <  0. 001), lateral shift ratio (23. 8  ±  11. 3 % to 11. 6  ±  13. 4 %, p <  0. 001), Kujala score (74. 0  ±  7. 8 points to 95. 7  ±  4. 4 points, p <  0. 0001), and Lysholm score (71. 0  ±  10 points to 95. 5  ±  5. 3 points, p <  0. 0001).

SIMPACK {{has been used for}} MBS analysis, and ANSYS for liquid sloshing modelling and equivalent mechanical systems validation. Acceleration and braking manoeuvres of the freight train set the liquid cargo into motion. This longitudinal sloshing motion of the fluid cargo inside the tanks initiated a swinging motion of some components of the coupling gear. The coupling gear consists of UIC standard traction hooks and coupling screws that are located between buffers. One of the coupling screws is placed in the traction hook of the opposite wagon thus joining the two wagons, whereas the unused coupling screw rests on a hanger. Simulation results showed that, for certain combinations of type of liquid, filling level and container dimensions, the liquid cargo could provoke an undesirable, although not hazardous, release of the unused coupling screw from its hanger. The coupling <b>screw's</b> <b>release</b> was especially obtained when a period of acceleration was followed by an abrupt braking manoeuvre at 1 m/s 2.
