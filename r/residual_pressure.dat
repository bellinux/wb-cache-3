The cylinder must be in test and suitable for the gas to be filled, and the cylinder may not be filled above the developed pressure for the temperature reached when it is filled. An external inspection of the cylinder must be made, and specified details of the cylinder and fill must be recorded. If the fill is of a gas other than air, the analysis of the completed fill must be recorded by the filler and signed by the customer. If the <b>residual</b> <b>pressure</b> in a cylinder presented for filling does not produce a reasonably strong flow of gas from the valve when opened the filler may refuse to fill the cylinder unless an acceptable reason is given for it being empty, as there is no way for the filler to check if it has been contaminated.|$|E
25|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{process is}} inefficient, and the secondary radiation is much weaker than the primary beam. Furthermore, the secondary radiation from lighter elements is of relatively low energy (long wavelength) and has low penetrating power, and is severely attenuated if the beam passes through air for any distance. Because of this, for high-performance analysis, the path from tube to sample to detector is maintained under vacuum (around 10 Pa <b>residual</b> <b>pressure).</b> This means in practice {{that most of}} the working parts of the instrument have to be located in a large vacuum chamber. The problems of maintaining moving parts in vacuum, and of rapidly introducing and withdrawing the sample without losing vacuum, pose major challenges for the design of the instrument. For less demanding applications, or when the sample is damaged by a vacuum (e.g. a volatile sample), a helium-swept X-ray chamber can be substituted, with some loss of low-Z (Z = atomic number) intensities.|$|E

5000|$|From the {{pressure}} graphs, {{it can be}} seen that the <b>residual</b> <b>pressure</b> in the barrel as the bullet exits is quite high, in this case over 16 kpsi / 110 MPa / 1100 bar. While lengthening the barrel or reducing the amount of propellant gas will reduce this pressure, that often is not possible due to issues of firearm size and minimum required energy. Short-range target guns usually are chambered for [...]22 Long Rifle or [...]22 Short, which have very tiny powder capacities and little <b>residual</b> <b>pressure.</b> When higher energies are required for long-range shooting, hunting or anti-personnel use, high muzzle pressures are a necessary evil. With these high muzzle pressures come increased flash and noise from the muzzle blast, and, due to the large powder charges used, higher recoil. Recoil includes the reaction caused not just by the bullet, but also by the powder mass and speed (with the residual gases acting as a rocket exhaust). However, for a muzzle brake to be effective there must be significant muzzle pressure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is very {{important}} to determine the expansion <b>pressure</b> or <b>residual</b> contact <b>pressure</b> of tube-to-tubesheet joint. The expansion <b>pressure</b> and the <b>residual</b> contact <b>pressure</b> are affected by the geometry, material mechanical properties of the tube and tubesheet. In the basic theory of calculating the <b>residual</b> contact <b>pressure</b> of tube-to-tubesheet joints, the elastic-perfectly material is assumed. Because of the strain-hardening of the materials, linear strain-hardening or power strain-hardening were adopted in some analyzing models of the hydraulically expanded tube-to-tubesheet joint. In this paper, a general strain-hardening material model is adopted and an analytical model is proposed and validated by finite element analysis results. The elastic-perfectly model, linear strain-hardening model or power strain-hardening can be the special case of the present model...|$|R
50|$|The {{overpressure}} wave {{from the}} muzzle blast of a firearm can contain {{a significant amount}} of energy because it travels at an extremely high velocity. <b>Residual</b> <b>pressures</b> at the muzzle can be a significant fraction of the peak chamber pressure, especially when slow burning powders or short barrels are used.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} the barrel {{is to provide a}} {{consistent}} seal, allowing the bullet to accelerate to a consistent velocity.

The automated targeting system was taking Eagle toward what Armstrong described as a [...] "football-field sized crater, {{with a large number}} of big boulders and rocks for about one or two crater diameters around it", which he avoided by assuming manual control and flying a bit further downrange.

40|$|BACKGROUND: After Nissen fundoplication, {{troublesome}} dysphagia {{develops in}} 5 - 10 per cent of patients. The mechanism of dysphagia {{has not been}} fully resolved, {{in spite of a}} number of studies focusing on oesophageal motility and lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS) dynamics. Tightness and length of the wrap have had considerable attention, without giving a fully satisfactory explanation of the pathophysiological mechanism. METHODS: Eighteen patients with persistent dysphagia after Nissen fundoplication needing reoperation were studied. Eighteen patients, matched for age and sex, without dysphagia after Nissen fundoplication were used as controls. Reoperation consisted of conversion of a 360 degrees into a 270 degrees wrap. Barium swallow, endoscopy, oesophageal manometry and 24 -h pH monitoring were performed before and after (re) operation. RESULTS: Peristaltic amplitude, velocity and duration of contraction were not significantly influenced by operation. In 16 of 18 patients with dysphagia, LOS relaxation was incomplete and the <b>residual</b> relaxation <b>pressure</b> was significantly higher than that in the group without dysphagia (P < 0. 01). No correlation was found between LOS pressure and peristaltic amplitude, nor between LOS pressure and ramp pressure in the distal oesophagus. After reoperation, basal LOS pressure decreased significantly (P < 0. 01) and LOS relaxation was complete in all but three patients; <b>residual</b> relaxation <b>pressure</b> decreased (P < 0. 01) and was significantly lower than that after uncomplicated Nissen fundoplication. In the latter group, LOS <b>pressure,</b> <b>residual</b> relaxation <b>pressure</b> and ramp pressure increased significantly after operation (P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: A return to complete LOS relaxation and a decrease in <b>residual</b> relaxation <b>pressure</b> {{play an important role in}} resolving dysphagi...|$|R
