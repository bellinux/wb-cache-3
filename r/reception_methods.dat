40|$|Abstract — In {{a single}} carrier {{modulation}} system with cyclic prefix (SC-CP), equalization {{is possible for}} the case where the delayed signals lie within the guard interval (GI). The reception of all the delayed signals within the GI can increase the received signal power, and hence may improve the system performance. However, it also increases {{the probability that the}} channel transfer function has a zero (or zeros) on the FFT grid, which results in serious noise enhancement (NE). Therefore, some appropriate <b>reception</b> <b>methods,</b> which can receive multiple delayed signals within the GI while avoiding the NE, are required. In this paper, in order to achieve such a reception, an adaptive antenna array is applied to the SC-CP system, and the optimum weights control method is proposed.

The communication system first transmits {{a small number of}} training pulses to probe the dispersive medium. The time-reversed probe signals are then utilized as the information carrying waveforms. Rapid timing acquisition of transmitted waveforms for demodulation over elastic medium is made possible by exploring the reciprocity property of guided elastic waves.

40|$|The work {{reported}} in this thesis focuses {{on the development of}} indirect methods for the experimental determination of important source parameters for structure-borne sound source characterization. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, matrix inversion methods for the determination of blocked forces are investigated. A simplified measurement procedure is proposed which offers a solution to the two major challenges to these methods, namely the acquisition of the FRF matrix and the problems associated with matrix inversion. The proposed procedure involves a free, low-mobility receiver plate which is modelled numerically. Calculated FRFs are used together with measured velocity responses to inversely determine the blocked forces. It is found that while the method has great potential in principle, in practice the accurate modelling of the receiver plate is of critical importance. In the second part of the thesis, three formulations are considered for the indirect determination of source mobility. Instead of performing measurements on the source in the free state, the source mobility is obtained from measurements made in-situ. This approach is beneficial if the source is difficult to suspend, or if it contains non-linear structural elements. The three formulations are validated numerically and experimentally. It is found that the methods can quantify source mobilities of single-contact and multi-contact sources from in-situ measurements. However, typical measurement errors, such as background noise or inaccuracies in sensor positioning, can significantly reduce the accuracy and reliability of the methods. In the final part of the thesis, the <b>reception</b> plate <b>method</b> for the determination of the power injected by a high-mobility source into a low-mobility receiver is reviewed, and a source substitution method proposed as a development. The substitution method circumvents problems that may arise when the <b>reception</b> plate <b>method</b> is applied to coupled walls and floors. A special focus of investigation is on the calibration of the receiver structure.

The creative team want to pursue this project because we believe that early childhood audience have an {{understanding and appreciation of}} sophisticated hybridity of theatrical forms through their play. As such, the project harnesses the innovative theatre work often made for adults and creates a work with the same formal sophistication and strength for children. The project is innovative in both form and process with a view to positioning the eventual work as a festival event, for national and international audiences. To achieve this goal we have positioned the creative development with a high profile venue partner, the Queensland Performing Arts Centre, who are at the forefront of innovative festival productions for early childhood audience with the Out Of the Box Festival. The process for the creative development is a particularly risky; because it seeks a genuine convergence of forms where no one form will be privileged over the other throughout the process, however all of them through their convergence can be considered as ‘theatre’. Current Status - The work has received a New Works grant from the Australia Council Theatre Board for 25 500 for the first phase of creative development (see Funding Schedule attached for future options to bring the work to performance and potentially national/international tour) Research Outline This project positions the work as three way collaboration, between creative practitioners, industry and the Higher Education sector framing the project as both creative practice and research. Maintaining the integrity of the creative development as research Queensland University of Technology has contributed in-kind support and funds for a Research Assistant to facilitate research methodologies, data collection and reporting on the intermedial creative process and the audience’s reception of the creative development.

There is no Swedish law or national policy that determines how new children will start and continue their education in Swedish schools. The decision {{is up to the}} schools or the communes. This study investigates what kind of educational methods teachers, from a sample of two different schools, are using to educate the newly-arrived students and if these methods are making any contribution to integrating these children into the Swedish school system. The study will raise questions like, how are the new students introduced to the Swedish school, {{what is the purpose of}} having the children in preparation class as opposed to normal class, and what methods do the interviewed teachers use to integrate the new children into the school system? Interviews were conducted with four teachers, an associate professor and a senior lecturer in education, who has done several years of research about children from abroad coming in to the Swedish school system. The primary theoretical frames in this study were the sociocultural perspective, language socialization, integration and inclusion. The results show that by not having a comprehensive policy for the newly arrived students, each teacher has a different educational method and the schools are not given enough recourses to help the student succeed. One of the conclusions is that to have a good integration of new students, the schools need to find a <b>reception</b> <b>method</b> that works for each new student based on a comprehensive policy...|$|R

40|$|Wireless {{channels}} are often multipath channels. In a multipath channel, a path {{can be defined}} as a copy of the transmitted signal arriving at the receiver with a particular delay and amplitude. If the multipaths are resolvable, RAKE receivers can collect the energy of distinct paths. DS-CDMA systems, with their low auto-correlation spreading sequences, enable resolving of the multipaths and therefore the use of RAKE reception. Each RAKE finger, the elementary receiver in RAKE reception, is associated with one of the strongest incoming paths. The outputs of those fingers are combined together to detect the transmitted symbols. The conventional RAKE receivers have several weaknesses. This thesis focuses on the major weaknesses of sensitivity to interference and channel estimation error. It introduces a receiver model to cope with both of them for both single and multi antenna (MIMO) systems. We propose a new RAKE <b>reception</b> <b>method,</b> which is called the generalized decorrelating RAKE receiver (GD-RAKE). GD-RAKE is obtained by the combination of two advanced RAKE receivers: the decorrelating discrete time RAKE receiver (D-DTR) and the generalized RAKE receiver (G-RAKE). The method enables robust performance in the presence of channel estimation errors and colored noise plus interference with the help of statistics on the channel, noise and interference. Additionally the performance of the new receiver is tested in MIMO channels. Soon to be commercialized ultra wideband (UWB) systems use more than 500 MHz bandwidth. Such a high bandwidth results in many resolvable multipaths and as such the employment of RAKE receivers is very suitable. We tested the performance of a G-RAKE receiver with decision feedback equalizers and showed that {{it can be used to}} improve overall performance of the system...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- The Proposed routing {{algorithm}} Ameliorated Dynamic Source Routing protocol (ADSR) is {{a modified}} DSR protocol with improved performance for Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET). Aim of this algorithm is {{to overcome the}} disadvantages in conventional DSR Protocol: Energy constrains, congestions and route reply storm problem. ADSR adjusts the Round Trip Time and limits the RREP message count from destination to control route reply storm and congestion. It also saves the energy consumed by nodes during data communication by using Discontinuous <b>Reception</b> (DRX) <b>method.</b> All three protocols original DSR, existing system Efficient Power Aware Routing (EPAR) algorithm and proposed system ADSR are evaluated and performance comparison {{has been done to}} show the improvements in ADSR. Simulations are performed using NS- 2 by considering various network metrics...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} research paradigms which study {{factors that}} allow influencing the language {{development of children}} with mild intellectual disabilities to the greatest extent possible. Special attention {{is dedicated to the}} development of the reception competence with the use of <b>reception</b> didactics <b>methods</b> based on a relatively frequent use of less demanding non-language semiotic functions. The core of the paper presents results of an experimental case study (on a sample of five children with a mild intellectual disability over a one school year period), through which the reception competence in these children was developed with a systematic use of an adapted communication model of literary education as an experimental factor. The results have confirmed the initially set hypothesis about reception progress...|$|R
