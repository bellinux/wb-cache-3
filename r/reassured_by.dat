5|$|Harding's death {{came as a}} great {{shock to}} the nation. The {{president}} was liked and admired, and the press and public had followed his illness closely, and been <b>reassured</b> <b>by</b> his apparent recovery. Harding was returned to his train in a casket for a journey across the nation followed closely in the newspapers. Nine million people lined the tracks as Harding's body was taken from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., and after services there, home to Marion, Ohio, for burial.|$|E
5|$|And so matters stood {{until the}} massive PAVN/NLF Tet Offensive of early 1968. Although a {{tactical}} victory for American and South Vietnamese forces, Tet became a political disaster. The American public (who had been <b>reassured</b> <b>by</b> President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Pentagon that the communists were incapable of launching any such actions) were {{stunned by the}} size and ferocity of the offensive. The {{light at the end}} of the tunnel had been extinguished, if it had ever existed at all. The president, in an attempt to nudge Hanoi to the negotiating table, decreed an end to bombing operations in North Vietnam north of the 20th parallel, effectively ending Rolling Thunder on 11 November 1968.|$|E
5|$|Willoughby stormed Île de la Passe on 13 August and {{captured}} it, blocking {{the entrance to}} Grand Port. With the harbour secure, Willoughby raided along the coastline while Pym, reinforced by Henry Lambert in Iphigenia and Lucius Curtis in Magicienne, blockaded Port Napoleon. On 20 August, sails were spotted approaching Grand Port and Willoughby determined to trick the approaching ships into entering the channel under Île de la Passe, where he could attack and capture them. The squadron was Duperré's squadron returning from the African coast with their prizes and, despite misgivings from Captain Bouvet, Duperré was determined to enter Grand Port and <b>reassured</b> <b>by</b> recognition signals flown by Willoughby, who had captured the French codes on Île de la Passe. As the French passed the fort, Willoughby sprang his trap and opened fire, but a false French tricolour flying from Île de la Passe accidentally ignited as it was lowered. The fire spread to a ready magazine in the fort, which exploded, causing severe damage and casualties. In the confusion {{all but one of}} Duperré's ships successfully entered the harbour.|$|E

5|$|In 1387, {{the united}} {{forces of the}} Principality of Serbia and the Kingdom of Bosnia managed to defeat the Ottomans in the Battle of Pločnik. Encouraged by the Christian success, Ivan Shishman {{immediately}} invalidated his vassalage to Murad I and refused to send troops in his support in 1388. The Ottomans reacted by sending a 30,000-strong army, {{under the command of}} the grand vizier Ali Pasha, {{to the north of the}} Balkan Mountains. The Ottoman troops seized the fortresses of Shumen, Madara, Venchan and Ovech. Ivan Shishman left Tarnovo and headed to Nikopol, where he was besieged and forced to ask for peace. The Ottomans requested that he reconfirm his vassalage in addition to surrendering Silistra, at the time the most populous Bulgarian city along the Danube. However, Ivan Shishman, <b>reassured</b> <b>by</b> his neighbours that he would receive support and the preparations of Serbia for war, not only refused to let the Ottomans in the city, but also strengthened its walls. Ali Pasha crossed the Balkan Mountains for a second time to consecutively capture Shumen, Cherven, Svishtov and once again besiege Ivan Shishman in Nikopol. Surprised by the swift Ottoman response and having not received the promised assistance, the Bulgarian emperor had to ask for peace. His pleas were accepted, but the terms were harsher than the original: not only Silistra was to be surrendered, but Ottoman garrisons were to be stationed in other Bulgarian cities, most notably Shumen and Ovech.|$|E
5|$|Indira Parthasarathy's Nandan Kathai (1978) {{builds the}} tale of Nandanar (referred in the work as Nandan) further, {{introducing}} two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, who are as ruthless as Bharati's Vediyar. Nandanar is portrayed as a lover of art, rather than God. He {{wants to see the}} cosmic dance of Nataraja. A Devadasi called Abhirami also appears; no significant female characters are found in earlier narratives. Indira is blunt in reprimanding the Dalits for not understanding Nandanar. Nandan Kathai is a quest for liberation of Dalits and women alike. Unlike earlier narratives, Indira's tale is devoid of miracles and is a story of how Nandanar falls prey to a conspiracy. The Vediyar-priest, the Vediyar-landlord and the two non-Brahmin upper caste landholders, hatch a plot to end Nandan. They make Nandanar believe that God harvested crop from the field, an allusion to the miracle of Vediyar's impossible task in Bharati's work. Then, they persuade him to organize a dance contest between Bharatnatyam, the high-caste elites' dance and the folk dance of the Dalits. Finally, in the climax, Nandanar agrees to undergo a fire-trial, <b>reassured</b> <b>by</b> the earlier miracle, but he and Abhirami burn in the flames. The upper castes succeed in sending a warning to Dalits how trespassers of the caste code, longing for salvation, would be punished.|$|E
5|$|Lightning Returns is set {{after the}} events of Final Fantasy XIII and Final Fantasy XIII-2. In XIII, Lightning is one of six people who are turned by a fal'Cie—one of a race created by the gods—into l'Cie, {{servants}} of the fal'Cie gifted with magical powers and a 'Focus'—an assigned task to be completed within a time limit; those that succeed in their Focus go into crystal stasis, while those that fail turn into monsters called Cie'th. The six were intended to cause the large, floating sphere named Cocoon to fall onto the world of Gran Pulse below, killing all the humans of Cocoon. At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support Cocoon, preventing the catastrophe. The remaining l'Cie were made human again by the Goddess Etro, the deity responsible for maintaining the balance between the mortal world and the Unseen Realm. In XIII-2, it is revealed that Etro's interference allowed Chaos, an energy trapped in the Unseen Realm, to escape and distort the timeline as written {{after the fall of}} Cocoon. Lightning was drawn to Valhalla, Etro's citadel, and decided to stay and act as her protector. Three years after Cocoon's fall, Lightning's sister Serah sets out to correct the distortions and reunite with Lightning, while the people of Gran Pulse construct a new Cocoon, since the old one is destined to collapse. The protagonists unwittingly end up instigating the death of Etro, which allows Chaos to spill into the mortal world and bring an end to time itself. Serah also dies, causing Lightning to nearly lose hope. <b>Reassured</b> <b>by</b> her sister's spirit, Lightning chooses to enter crystal stasis to preserve her sister's memory and keep hope alive.|$|E

5|$|Mercedes Maria Theresa Immaculata McQueen (also Owen, Fisher and Browning) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British Channel 4 soap opera, Hollyoaks, played by Jennifer Metcalfe. She debuted on-screen during the episode airing on 19 June 2006 {{as the first}} character to be introduced to the series by series producer, Bryan Kirkwood. In 2008 Metcalfe feared that the character was to be axed but was later <b>reassured</b> <b>by</b> the series producer {{that she would not}} be. Metcalfe later stated her intention to stay with the series. Mercedes is part of the McQueen family and is the longest serving McQueen on the series. On 26 August 2014, it was revealed that Metcalfe had decided to quit the soap. On 18 November 2014, Mercedes was presumably stabbed to death, with her body discarded. However, Metcalfe returned to screens on 17 February 2015 in a surprise, unannounced twist which saw Mercedes revealed as alive and well, living in Nice, France. It was announced that Mercedes would make a full-time return to the show in May 2015, after brief appearances on 18 February, 9 March, and 6 April. Metcalfe took another hiatus from the show beginning 21 January 2016, before reappearing 1 April 2016. Metcalfe announced her pregnancy in 2017 and revealed that she would be taking a year's break from the show. Mercedes was last seen on screen leaving with Goldie McQueen (Chelsee Healey) on 4 July 2017. As of July 2017, Mercedes and Goldie have been removed from the show's opening credits, following their departure. On 7 September 2017, Mercedes briefly reappeared in a flashback sequence involving her and Amy Barnes surmised by James Nightingale. Mercedes will return full-term in Summer 2018.|$|E

25|$|The play {{opened at}} the Arts Theatre in Cambridge on 10 February 1951 {{although}} Christie was absent as she was in Iraq accompanying her husband Max Mallowan {{on one of his}} archaeological expeditions.

Hundreds of miles away, she was as nervous as ever at the public reaction although she was <b>reassured</b> <b>by</b> telegrams which told her that the opening night was a success.

25|$|The South Vietnamese {{eventually}} {{had their}} way.

Khánh appeared <b>reassured</b> <b>by</b> this and made a public statement on 30 December, saying he was not as hostile to the Americans as reported, and he wanted Thiệu and Cang to meet the Americans to relieve any tension that remained.

25|$|Samuel {{initially}} appointed his {{two sons}} as his successors; however, just like Eli's sons, Samuel's proved unworthy. The Israelites rejected them. Because of the external threat from other tribes, such as the Philistines, the tribal leaders decided {{that there was a}} need for a more unified, central government, and demanded Samuel appoint a king so that they could be like other nations. Samuel interpreted this as a personal rejection, and at first was reluctant to oblige, until <b>reassured</b> <b>by</b> a divine revelation. He warned the people of the potential negative consequences of such a decision. When Saul and his servant were searching for his father's lost asses, the servant suggested consulting the nearby Samuel. Samuel recognized Saul as the future king.|$|E

There was a history of either respiratory or alimentary tract symptoms, and of smoking, or a family history of cancer in 41 % of these women. The study shows that Edinburgh women are enthusiastic for breast screening and for its extension to include other forms of cancer...|$|R
25|$|While the Australian Government was <b>reassured</b> <b>by</b> Britain's {{assessment}} of the situation, the Allied military units stationed in Western Australia made preparations to resist a possible Japanese attack. The Royal Australian Air Force's (RAAF's) Western Area Command improved the readiness of its forces stationed near Perth and Exmouth Gulf in the north-west of the state. It also stockpiled bombs at Cunderdin to the north-east of Perth for use by any heavy bombers sent as reinforcements. The readiness of the Army garrison units in the Fremantle-Perth area were also increased. The Fremantle Fortress command, which {{was responsible for the}} defence of the port against naval bombardment or air attack, was placed on alert and ordered to station additional heavy anti-aircraft guns near the city's docks. On 4 March the local Volunteer Defence Corps personnel were also ordered to be able to man their assigned anti-aircraft and coast defence positions within six hours, rather than the normal warning time of 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|McNeil's actions {{came too}} late. Ogdensburg rammed Atlantic {{on the port}} side, forward of the paddlewheel, cutting into Atlantic side down to the waterline. Ogdensburg {{reversed}} and backed away from Atlantic, while Atlantic continued away under full steam. Perhaps <b>reassured</b> <b>by</b> Atlantic steaming away, McNeil steered Ogdensburg back onto its regular course. Many passengers on Atlantic were awakened by the collision, but the crew of Atlantic {{made no effort to}} alert all the passengers. Water flowing in through the hole in Atlantic soon flooded the boilers, bringing the ship to a halt. The passengers and crew began to panic, many throwing anything that would float {{over the side of the}} ship before jumping over the side themselves, where many drowned. An attempt was made to launch Atlantic three boats; one capsized, and Captain Petty suffered a concussion while lowering another, leaving him unable to provide any more assistance. The two other boats were lowered, carrying mostly crew members. The bow of Atlantic began to sink, but the stern was kept above water by air trapped inside the ship.|$|E
25|$|Having {{left his}} {{equipment}} behind during the hasty retreat, the protagonist, now obviously hallucinating, uses the almost superhuman reflexes afforded {{to him by}} the final Mark to evade death at the hands of both the bandits and the Hisomu stalkers, and travels back to Japan with Ora, who recommends he kill Azai for the dishonor of failing to maintain the traditional Hisomu way. The protagonist uses his almost preternatural abilities to infiltrate past Hisomu-jo's new sophisticated defenses, and confronts Azai in his garden. When Ora arrives and commands the protagonist to slay Azai, Azai claims to be unable to see Ora, and, suggesting that she is a symptom of the protagonist's creeping madness, insists that he satisfy his honor and kill himself before he slips too far beyond reason. Suddenly uncertain, the protagonist is <b>reassured</b> <b>by</b> Ora that Azai is lying to deceive him, and she urges him to murder Azai and purge the dishonorable Hisomu clan who followed him. Upon retrieving the ritual sword, the protagonist experiences a brief psychotic fugue state, in which he symbolically relives the events of his life subsequent to taking on the Mark. He finds himself in a courtyard opposite both Ora and Azai, who kneels and places his own sheathed sword on the ground, awaiting the protagonist's choice.|$|E

25|$|On 11 July, Rawlinson {{met again}} with the corps commanders and divisional commanders, who wanted the {{original}} plan reinstated. Haig compromised with a scheme in which XV Corps, with reinforcements, would still attack first but XIII Corps would dig positions on the south slopes of the ridge from Longueval to Bazentin and send patrols forward, ready to attack if it were feasible, to assist the XV Corps attack against both Bazentin woods and Bazentin le Petit. XV Corps would wheel east, to roll up the defences opposite XIII Corps which would then attack. Rawlinson contacted Haig again on 12 July and his Major-General General Staff (MGGS) Archibald Montgomery, contacted Launcelot Kiggell the BEF Chief of the General Staff, to make a final appeal. Haig gave way, provided that the supporting points were built by XIII Corps and the flanks were protected by garrisons in Mametz and Trônes woods. Most of Mametz Wood had already been captured and the fight for Trônes Wood continued. Haig was also <b>reassured</b> <b>by</b> Major-General Noel Birch the BEF MGRA (Major-General Royal Artillery) that the bombardment was succeeding, that German underground shelters in the second position would be shallower than those overrun on 1 July, that the British had gained artillery superiority and that a dawn attack would mean {{plenty of time for}} exploitation.|$|E
