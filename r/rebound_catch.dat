6000|$|Here's the problem. Instead {{of pulling}} honestly, Prince is lagging back and {{manoeuvring}} for a bite at Milda's neck. I have four reins in my hands. I must put these four reins into my left hand, properly gather the whip handle and the bight of the lash {{in my right}} hand, and throw that lash past Maid without striking her and into Prince. If the lash strikes Maid, her thoroughbredness will go up in the air, and I'll have a case of horse hysteria on my hands for the next half hour. But follow. The whole problem is not yet stated. Suppose that I miss Maid and reach the intended target. The instant the lash cracks, the four horses jump, Prince most of all, and his jump, with spread wicked teeth, is for the back of Milda's neck. She jumps to escape--which is her second jump, for the first one came when the lash exploded. The Outlaw reaches for Maid's neck, and Maid, who has already jumped and tried to bolt, tries to bolt harder. And all this infinitesimal fraction of time I am trying to hold the four animals with my left hand, while my whip-lash, writhing through the air, is coming back to me. Three simultaneous things I must do: keep hold of the four reins with my left hand; slam on the brake with my foot; and on the <b>rebound</b> <b>catch</b> that flying lash {{in the hollow of}} my right arm and get the bight of it safely into my right hand. Then I must get two of the four lines back into my right hand and keep the horses from running away or going over the grade. Try it some time. You will find life anything but wearisome. Why, the first time I hit the mark and made the lash go off like a revolver shot, I was so astounded and delighted that I was paralysed. I forgot to do any of the multitudinous other things, tangled the whip lash in Maid's harness, and was forced to call upon Charmian for assistance. And now, confession. I carry a few pebbles handy. They're great for reaching Prince in a tight place. But just the same I'm learning that whip every day, and before I get home I hope to discard the pebbles. And as long as I rely on pebbles, I cannot truthfully speak of myself as [...] "tooling a four-in-hand." ...|$|E

5000|$|Steinmetz was {{credited}} with being an innovator in technique. In an era when the underhand, two-handed shot was the norm, Steinmetz often used a [...] "one-hander." [...] Steinmetz later recalled that the one-hander was [...] "always good {{for three or four}} baskets before they caught on to it." [...] He also had the ability to <b>rebound</b> or <b>catch</b> a pass and shoot while in the air, [...] "a feat that was unheard of in those days." [...] In 1958, Steinmetz told a reporter that the modern game was as different from the game he played as [...] "hearts is from poker." [...] He concluded that the biggest change in the game was eliminating the [...] "center jump," [...] in which there was a jump ball at center court after every score. He noted: [...] "It makes basketball a percentage game. Whichever team is hitting for the best percentage of their shots wins. It used to be that the good team would get the ball again in the center jump and one team would pull farther ahead of the other." ...|$|R
