25|$|Until {{the early}} 19th century, {{there were only}} a few {{craftsmen}} and merchants in the town, because they had to pay taxes to the bishop who owned the city. By the 1830s 10% of the residents of the mostly Roman Catholic town were Jewish, but even they did not give a boost to trade. Because of this, even though the town was the centre of administration, economically and culturally it wasn't <b>really</b> <b>important.</b> Even though it had about 3,500 residents, it had only two primary schools. The cultural centres of the comitatus were Kanizsa and Keszthely.|$|E

25|$|The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, {{holder of}} the Karma Kagyu and Nyingma lineages, in a 2008 talk {{delivered}} to LGBT Dharma practitioners at the Shambhala Meditation Center of New York, stressed that for vajrayana lay practitioners, homosexual relationships {{are no better}} or worse than heterosexual relationships and that only unhealthy relationships in general are to be avoided. Both the Nalandabodhi sangha, which was founded by The Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche, and the Shambhala sanghas founded by Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche have stated that they are welcoming of all sexual orientations. The Shambhala Meditation Center of New York hosts a weekly practice group, Queer Dharma, specifically catering {{to the needs of}} the LGBTQ Buddhist community. According to the Danish Karma Kagyu Lama Ole Nydahl, Buddha saw homosexuality as circumstances making life more difficult, but also explained the reason for homosexuality could be aversion against the opposite sex in a former life. Nydahl says however that sexual orientation is not <b>really</b> <b>important</b> in order to practice Buddhism.|$|E
25|$|Sea ice {{serves to}} {{stabilise}} methane deposits on {{and near the}} shoreline, preventing the clathrate breaking down and venting into the water column and eventually reaching the atmosphere. From sonar measurements in recent years researchers quantified the density of bubbles emanating from the subsea permafrost into the Ocean (a process called ebullition), and found that 100–630mg methane per square meters is emitted daily along the East Siberian Shelf, into the water column. They also found that during storms, methane levels {{in the water column}} drop dramatically, when wind-driven air-sea gas exchange accelerates the ebullition process into the atmosphere. This observed pathway suggests that methane from seabed permafrost will progress rather slowly, instead of abrupt changes. However, Arctic cyclones, fueled by global warming and further accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could contribute to more release from this methane cache, which is <b>really</b> <b>important</b> for the Arctic. An update to the mechanisms of this permafrost degradation, implying the possibility of being close to an acceleration of methane release was published in 2017.|$|E
25|$|During this period, the MWRC {{networked}} {{with community}} cultural leaders through the Kimberley Aboriginal Law and Cultural Centre (KALACC), an Aboriginal organisation {{that supports the}} traditional practices of the 30 language groups in the Kimberley. Oscar revealed the significance of their support in the alcohol restriction campaign:It was <b>really</b> <b>important</b> to let elders know what was happening. We liaised with cultural leaders and elders through KALACC. KALACC helped facilitate approval from elders for the alcohol restrictions.The role of KALACC was critical; {{it would have been}} very interesting had they not supported the campaign. The support of KALACC managed some of the forces in the community.Oscar’s move to get the backing of elders and cultural leaders was a major factor in persuading the Director of Liquor Licensing to impose the alcohol restrictions and should not be underestimated. Certain sectors of the community were against the restrictions and the support from elders gave the MWRC campaign the legitimacy it needed in enduring strong criticism. In the face of fierce opposition from some members of her community who had a vested interest in the sale of alcohol, Oscar stood firm. She knew the restrictions would give her people much needed relief from the trauma and chaos caused by alcohol abuse.|$|E
