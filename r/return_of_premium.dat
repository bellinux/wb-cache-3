Under the Heston’s stochastic volatility model, this paper focuses on mean-variance insurers with the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> clauses to study the optimal time-consistent investment strategy for the DC pension merged with an annuity contract. Both accumulation phase before retirement and distribution phase after retirement are studied. In the time-consistent framework, the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations associated with the optimization problem are established. Applying stochastic optimal control technique, the time-consistent explicit solutions of the optimal strategies and the efficient frontiers are obtained.

40|$|The {{guaranteed}} minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) rider {{guarantees the}} <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>premiums</b> {{in the form}} of periodic withdrawals while allowing policyholders to participate fully in any market gains. The product has evolved into a lifetime version (GLWB) and is a vital component of the variable annuity marketplace, representing asset values of 294 B as of September 2011. GMWB riders represent an embedded option on the account value with a fee structure that is different from typical financial derivatives. We present an in-depth study into pricing and hedging the GMWB rider from a financial economic perspective. Our main contributions are twofold. We construct a binomial asset pricing model for GMWBs under optimal policyholder behaviour which results in explicitly formulated perfect hedging strategies in a binomial world. The numerical toolbox for pricing GMWBs in a Black-Scholes world is expanded to include binomial methods. To motivate our work, we begin with a review of the continuous model and a comprehensive synthesis of results from the literature. Throughout, particular focus is placed on the unique perspectives of the insurer and policyholder and the unifying relationship. We also present an approximation algorithm that significantly improves efficiency of the binomial model while retaining accuracy. Several numerical examples are provided which illustrate both the accuracy and the tractability of the model. Finally, we explore the effect of deterministic mortality on pricing GMWBs, and run mortality simulations to obtain hedging results which support the diversification principle...|$|R

"Commutation provision" [...] means {{a verbal}} or written agreement, {{whether or not}} {{formally}} incorporated into an insurance or reinsurance policy, that allows the policyholder to commute the policy, usually implying that all liabilities and rights created by that contract are extinguished {{in return for the}} balance of an experience account. Generally provisions such as [...] "profit sharing" [...] or [...] "low claims bonus," [...] which also produce a <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> that can be reduced by claims payments, are not considered Commutation Provisions if they do not extinguish the contract.

50|$|Term life {{insurance}} can be contrasted to permanent {{life insurance}} such as whole life, universal life, and variable universal life, which guarantee coverage at fixed premiums for {{the lifetime of}} the covered individual unless the policy is allowed to lapse. Term insurance is not generally used for estate planning needs or charitable giving strategies but is used for pure income replacement needs for an individual. Term insurance functions {{in a manner similar}} to most other types of insurance in that it satisfies claims against what is insured if the premiums are up to date and the contract has not expired and does not provide for a <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> dollars if no claims are filed. As an example, auto insurance will satisfy claims against the insured in the event of an accident and a homeowner policy will satisfy claims against the home if it is damaged or destroyed, for example, by fire. Whether or not these events will occur is uncertain. If the policyholder discontinues coverage because he or she has sold the insured car or home, the insurance company will not refund the full premium.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine if the return is higher for active savers than fornon-active savers in the Swedish premium pension system. The {{timeframe}} {{of the study is}} 2001 – 2009 and it is presumed that the pension saver only makes one choice of funds in the Swedish premium pension system and then keeps these. No regard has been taken to the different fees associated with funds and the management of them. The study is based on a quantitative approach since it employs numerical secondary data and it has a deductive approach given that it is based on existing theory. The study was conductedby comparing the average <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the Swedish <b>premium</b> savings fund with the average <b>return</b> <b>of</b> three different fund portfolios with different risk levels recommended by Morningstar. The study shows that those who place their savings in the recommended fund portfolios receive a higher return in two out of three fund portfolios. However,being an active saver can be associated with higher risk and an active choice is not always profitable. Validerat; 20131029 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, it {{is shown}} {{that with a}} certain {{definition}} of risk-based discounted loss reserves and a certain method of surplus allocation, there is an amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> for a contract which has the following properties: (1.) It is the amount <b>of</b> <b>premium</b> required for the contract to neither help nor hurt the insurer's risk-return relation. (2.) It produces an internal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> equal to the insurer's target return. If the insurer gets more than this amount <b>of</b> <b>premium,</b> then the insurer can get more return with the same risk by increasing the percentage <b>of</b> the <b>premium</b> for the overall book {{which is in the}} segment. Conversely, if the insurer gets less than this amount <b>of</b> <b>premium,</b> the insurer can increase its return by decreasing the percentage <b>of</b> the overall <b>premium</b> which is in the segment.

40|$|LawLL. D. The {{contract}} of insurance {{is one of}} the more frequently concluded commercial contracts. The premium which is undertaken in terms of an insurance contract {{is one of the}} essential features of the insurance contract. Notwithstanding the obvious importance of the role <b>of</b> the <b>premium</b> and the legal aspects surrounding it, it has in the past often received but scant treatment in insurance-law materials. In this thesis it is shown that there exist a number of aspects regarding the premium which are unclear and in need of careful scrutiny. In the case of certain other aspects (regarding the premium), although there is certainty as to their contents it is necessary to identify and (re-) define their place in the broader scheme of the insurance law. The study commences with an investigation into the historical development of the concepts of "insurance" and "premium". This is followed by a study of the relevant principles of Roman-Dutch law. A comparative study is made of the law in a number of countries, namely, the Netherlands, Belgium, England and Australia. The position in South African law is also considered. An introductory study is made regarding those concepts in South African indigenous law which are insurance-like. Finally, a number of conclusions are drawn and recommendations are made in respect of a selection of aspects regarding the premium which are unclear. These aspects concern the nature of the premium; the question whether "premiumless" or "free" insurance is legally possible; the question whether the parties may agree to insure at a "reasonable premium"; the protection of the insured in the case of the non­ payment of the premium; the receipt <b>of</b> the <b>premium</b> by the broker; the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the <b>premium</b> where the insured has acted fraudulently; the legal tenability of the practice of insuring the premium; the possibility that the contribution in terms of some concepts of our indigenous law may resemble the premium; and finally, the analogous method as a source of law to extend and broaden the pool of legal principles applicable to the insurance contract...|$|R
