25|$|The <b>rufous-naped</b> <b>lark</b> is sedentary, {{territorial}} and monogamous. It {{is often}} sluggish, allowing a close approach.

25|$|The <b>rufous-naped</b> <b>lark</b> is {{geographically}} very variable, and {{is taken}} to form a species complex with the allopatric red-winged lark of East Africa, and perhaps with the Somali lark. It is a smaller version of the first, with a finer bill and shorter tail, but their morphological and vocal features do not intergrade where their ranges meet. The rufous nape is an equivocal field character, being absent in the tropical races and in some individuals.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rufous-naped</b> <b>lark</b> {{is found}} {{in many parts of}} sub-Saharan Africa. It has a very large but {{discontinuous}} range, with an estimated global extent of occurrence of 5,600,000km2. Its range is believed to be increasingly fragmented in the north, from which a declining population is inferred. The southern African population has not contracted in range or abundance, save for areas of extensive cultivation or urbanization. Livestock ranching is believed to have created bare patches in grasslands, which they favour. The populations of southern Mozambique and Swaziland have been estimated at >50,000 and 100,000 individuals respectively.|$|E
25|$|Sharpe's lark, M. (a.) sharpii, {{of northwestern}} Somalia, has almost plain, coppery red upper parts and is {{sometimes}} (e.g., by Sibley and Monroe) {{regarded as a}} separate and endangered species. Its small range of some 21,200km2 is impacted by overgrazing and conversion to croplands. It may however be conspecific with Somali lark, M. (a.) somalica, which differs by its very long bill and white edges to the outer tail feathers. The Somali lark is sometimes considered a race of <b>rufous-naped</b> <b>lark,</b> but is alternatively deemed a full species in Mirafra or Certhilauda.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rufous-naped</b> <b>lark</b> (Mirafra africana) or rufous-naped bush lark is a {{widespread}} and conspicuous species of lark in the lightly wooded grasslands, open savannas and farmlands of the Afrotropics. Males attract attention to themselves by their bold and repeated wing-fluttering displays from prominent perches, which {{is accompanied by a}} melodious and far-carrying whistled phrase. This rudimentary display has been proposed as the precursor to the wing-clapping displays of other bush lark species. They have consistently rufous outer wings and a short erectile crest, but the remaining plumage hues and markings are individually and geographically variable. It has a straight lower, and longish, curved upper mandible.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rufous-naped</b> <b>lark</b> is {{a fairly}} large and robust lark species, with rather heavy flight. The sexes are similar, but males average larger and heavier. Adults are {{individually}} and geographically variable. It measures 15â€“18cm from bill tip to tail tip and weighs 40-44g. The streaked upper parts, short erectile crest, creamy-buff eyebrow that merges with the lore, and the rufous flight feathers are easily discernible features. The hindcrown and nape are streaked along the feather centers while the margins vary from chestnut, rufous or pinkish buff to greyish brown. The wings appear conspicuously rufous in flight, while the outer edges of the primaries show up as a rufous panel on the closed wing. The underwing coverts are rufous, and upper coverts are broadly edged tawny or buff (or grey in race grisescens). The tail is dark brown, but the outer webs of the outer tail feathers vary from buff (cf. africana and sharpii) to tawny or bright rufous. The mantle is lighter brown than the back, and the rump still darker brown. The flanks are a shade darker than the rufous-buff belly, but regionally the plumage may also be stained red by soil. The throat is unmarked but the pale rufous upper breast is streaked and spotted darker brown. The eyes are hazel brown, the longish bill is blackish and pinkish, and the feet pink to pinkish brown. Juveniles have bold black spotting on the crown, mantle and wing coverts, all edged with buff, while the breast spotting is more blotchy or diffuse.|$|E

5000|$|The red-winged lark {{is taken}} to form a species complex with the {{allopatric}} <b>rufous-naped</b> <b>lark,</b> and perhaps with the Somali lark. The name [...] "red-winged lark" [...] is sometimes used as an alternate name for the Indian bush lark. The alternate names red-winged bush lark and rufous-winged bush lark may {{also be used to}} describe the Indian bush lark or the Bengal bush lark respectively.|$|E
50|$|Such a {{description}} is insufficient, however, since as {{with some other}} lark species {{it is difficult to}} definitively describe the bird without comparison to its close relatives. In the case of Ash's lark, it is smaller than the <b>rufous-naped</b> <b>lark</b> or the red-winged lark, and more greyish and marked on its mantle than either the singing lark (which has a thicker bill) or the pink-breasted lark (which has a pinkish breast).|$|E
