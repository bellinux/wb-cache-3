The only reasonable explanation for the observed market behavior is tacit collusion. We analyze the effects of a number of proposed reform alternatives and we find that lowering the intervention price or the export subsidies will only serve to strengthen the tacitly collusive behavior whereas tariff reductions will always be beneficial to the EU consumer.

40|$|The present paper {{reports a}} {{comparative}} evaluation of four multivariate {{statistical process control}} (SPC) techniques for the on-line monitoring of an <b>industrial</b> <b>sugar</b> crystallization process. The process itself is challenging since it is carried out in multiple phases and there exists strong non-linear and dynamic effects between the variables. The methods investigated include classical on-line univariate statistical process control, batch dynamic principal component analysis (BDPCA), moving window principal component analysis (MWPCA), batch observation level analysis (BOL) and time-varying state space modelling (TVSS). The study is focused on issues of on-line detection of changes in crystallization process operation, the early warning of process malfunctions and potential production failures; problems {{that have not been}} directly addressed by existing statistical monitoring schemes. The results obtained demonstrate the superior performance of the TVSS approach to successfully detect abnormal events and periods of bad operation early enough to allow bad batches and related losses in amounts of recycled sucrose to be significantly reduced...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} that shapes the {{microbial}} community assembly in activated sludge wastewater treatment processes provide a conceptual foundation for improving process performance. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare two major theories (deterministic theory and neutral theory) regarding the assembly of microorganisms in activated sludge: Six lab-scale activated sludge sequencing batch reactors were inoculated with activated sludge collected from three different sources (domestic, <b>industrial,</b> and <b>sugar</b> industry WWTP). Additionally, two reactors were seeded with equal proportion of sludge from the three WWTPs. Duplicate reactors were used for each sludge source (i. e. domestic, <b>industrial,</b> <b>sugar</b> and mix). Reactors were operated in parallel for 11 weeks under identical conditions. Bacterial diversity and community structure in the eight SBRs were assessed by 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. The 16 S rRNA gene sequences were analyzed using taxonomic and clustering analysis and by measuring diversity indices (Shannon-weaver and Chao 1 indices). Cluster analysis revealed that the microbial community structure was dynamic and that replicate reactors evolved differently. Also the microbial community structure in the SBRs seeded with a different sludge did not converge after 11 weeks of operation under identical conditions. These results suggest that history and distribution of taxa in the source inoculum were stronger regulating factors in shaping bacterial community structure than environmental factors. This supports the neutral theory which states that the assembly of the local microbial community from the metacommunity is random and is regulated by the size and diversity of the metacommunity. Furthermore, sludge performance, measured by COD and ammonia removal, confirmed that broad-scale functions (e. g. COD removal) are not influenced by dynamics in the microbial composition, while specific functions (e. g. nitrification) are more susceptible to these changes...|$|R

40|$|In this {{research}} a new heterogeneous catalyst has {{been prepared for}} biodiesel production. The catalyst was prepared by sulfonating <b>industrial</b> <b>sugar</b> waste. Unlike homogeneous catalysts, which require further purification and separation from the biodiesel production reaction media, this inexpensive synthetic catalyst {{does not need to}} go through an additional separation process. This advantage consequently minimizes the total application costs. The catalyst was prepared by partially carbonizing sugar beet pulp at 400 °C. The carbonization product was then sulfonated with concentrated H 2 SO 4 vapor in order to produce a solid catalyst. The prepared catalyst was used in the esterification reaction between palm fatty acid distillate (PFAD) and methanol. The effects of the temperature, methanol/PFAD ratio, reaction time and catalyst dosage on the efficiency of the production were individually investigated. The optimum biodiesel production occurred at 85 °C, a reaction time of 300 min, catalyst dosage of 3 g and methanol/PFAD ratio of 5 : 1 (mol/mol), lowering the acid value from 198 to 13. 1 (mg KOH/g oil) or the equivalent, with a fatty acid methyl ester yield of around 92 %. The results suggest that the synthesized inexpensive catalyst is useful for biodiesel production from PFAD...|$|R
40|$|Sugar {{has been}} {{described}} appropriately, and elegantly, by an old Hindu philosopher as "The Life-Giving Energy of the Sun". It has also been estimated, perhaps conservatively, that sugar provides 10 % of the energy intake of the world's population. In times of world demand, rapid expansion and increasing annual tonnages, there would appear little need or desire to divert one's attention from the major preoccupation of producing "the best sugar in the world". It is indeed at these times when some consolidation is necessary to ensure the stability of our niarke. ts, particularly the South African market, that we must study and {{be familiar with the}} uses of sugar and the consumer's requirements. The South African Sugar Association recently established a Market Research Committee to perform this function and to promote sugar by-products, mod~fied sugars, and sugar derivatives.

Investors are leasing fertile farmland at bargain prices {{in order to produce}} food, feed and agro-fuels for an export market. The phenomenon of land grabbing - large-scale investments in agricultural land in developing countries – has been accompanied by evictions of poor farmers from their land, destruction of livelihoods and severe violations of human rights.

40|$|Research into fermentative {{production}} of lactic acid from agricultural by-products has recently {{concentrated on the}} direct conversion of biomass, whereby pure sugars are replaced with inexpensive feedstock {{in the process of}} lactic acid production. In our studies, for the first time, the source of carbon used is sugar beet pulp, generated as a by-product of <b>industrial</b> <b>sugar</b> production. In this paper, we focus on the simultaneous saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass and fermentation of lactic acid, using mixed cultures with complementary assimilation profiles. Lactic acid is one of the primary platform chemicals, and can be used to synthesize a wide variety of useful products, including green propylene glycol. A series of controlled batch fermentations was conducted under various conditions, including pretreatment with enzymatic hydrolysis. Inoculation was performed in two sequential stages, to avoid carbon catabolite repression. Biologically-synthesized lactic acid was catalytically reduced to propylene glycol over 5 % Ru/C. The highest lactic acid yield was obtained with mixed cultures. The yield of propylene glycol from the biological lactic acid was similar to that obtained with a water solution of pure lactic acid. Our results show that simultaneous saccharification and fermentation enables generation of lactic acid, suitable for further chemical transformations, from agricultural residues...|$|R

50|$|A typical sugar {{estate was}} 900 acre.

With {{the exception of}} the bookkeeper, {{by the middle of the}} eighteenth century, skilled enslaved Africans had replaced white indentured servants in these posts. The field enslavement' quarters were usually about a half mile away, closer to the <b>industrial</b> <b>sugar</b> mill, distillery and the boiling and curing houses, as well as the blacksmiths' and carpenters' sheds and thrash houses. In addition, there was a poultry pen and a cattle yard along with a hospital for Africans. Some estates, if large enough, had accommodation for an estate doctor. Estates had estate gardens and the Africans had their own kitchen gardens as well as polnicks provision grounds found in the hills, which were required by law from as early as 1678. During enslavement, however, the enslaved Africans kept pigs and poultry and grew mangoes, plantain, ackee, okra, yam and other ground provisions. The cultivation of these lands took on greater proportions as plantations were abandoned when the island faced increasing competition from Brazil, Cuba and beet sugar, a loss in labour after emancipation in the 1830s as well as the loss of protective trade duties after the passage of the 1846 Sugar Equalization Act in England.|$|R
