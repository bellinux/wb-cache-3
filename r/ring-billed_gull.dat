5|$|In 2009, $1 {{million of}} federal {{stimulus}} money was delegated to {{the restoration of}} the marshland near the Nueces Bay Causeway to increase the population of birds and fish. The Coastal Bend Bays and Estuaries Program and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service collaborated to place soil and plant marsh near the causeway to allow a larger nursing location for fish and provide greater quantities of food for water birds. Over 490 species of birds have been found in the area including the brown pelican, black-billed whistling duck, reddish egret, white-faced ibis, pauraque, buff-bellied hummingbird, golden-fronted woodpecker, long-billed thrasher, olive sparrow, Neotropic cormorant, laughing gull, Franklin's gull, <b>ring-billed</b> <b>gull,</b> herring gull, gull-billed tern, common loon, brown-crested flycatcher, hooded oriole, peregrine falcon and piping plover. Bird populations are protected and can be viewed at the Hans and Pat Suter Wildlife Refuge on Oso Bay.|$|E

40|$|Late-nesting <b>Ring-billed</b> <b>Gulls</b> in {{this study}} laid fewer and smaller eggs and hatched fewer young than earlier nesting pairs. Birds nesting {{late in the season}} {{appeared}} to lack sufficient stimuli for incubation, as indicated by their increased restlessness on the nest and higher desertion rates. Factors affecting their behavior include physical condition and social and environmental stimuli. Late-nesting gulls had a lower body weight and condition index than peak-nesting gulls. Their smaller egg size was attributable to decreased amounts of albumen. Analyses of blood metabolites and hormones were inconclusive. It is suggested that the low reproductive success experienced by "late"-nesting <b>Ring-billed</b> <b>Gulls</b> {{in this study}} results predominantly from factors during the incubation period...|$|R

40|$|Understanding how birds {{cope with}} climate change has {{received}} much attention in recent years. So far, more emphasis {{has been given}} to passerine species than to any other groups of birds, possibly because of the availability of long-term data sets. Our objective was to study the effect of climate change on spring arrival date and breeding chronology of <b>Ring-billed</b> <b>Gulls</b> (Larus delawarensis), a short-distance migrant with a diverse diet. Based on Étude des Populations d'Oiseaux du Québec (EPOQ) checklists, we found that gulls arrived in southern Québec five days earlier in 2012 than in 1971. Sporadic observations in three nearby colonies indicated that <b>Ring-billed</b> <b>gulls</b> laid eggs eight days earlier in 2012 than they did in 1978. Both arrival and laying dates closely fit temperature warming. Because of their diverse diet, <b>Ring-billed</b> <b>Gulls</b> always have access to some food resources during the breeding period making a mismatch between phenology and food abundance unlikely. Continuous warming may enhance the use of agricultural lands by gulls before and during the breeding period. However, this may not be sufficient to compensate for a reduction of refuse accessibility at landfills that have implemented deterrence programs...|$|R

40|$|Several study {{areas were}} {{investigated}} at two Port Colborne terneries during the summers of 1973 and 1974 {{in an attempt}} to determine the influence of clutch size, time of clutch initiation, position in the colony, proximity to <b>Ring-billed</b> <b>Gulls,</b> vegetation and nesting substrate on the reproductive performance of the Common Tern. Hatching success and reproductive success (the number of chicks fledged per egg laid) were generally higher for 3 -egg than 2 -egg clutches but fledging (the number of chicks fledged per egg hatched) success was usually independant of clutch size. Hatching, fledging and reproductive success declined as a function of time of clutch initiation. Mean clutch sizes also generally declined as a function of time. Nests located {{in the center of the}} colony exhibited higher fledging success than those on the periphery. Rock-based clutches had a lower hatching success than clutches initiated on sand or dried vegetation.

40|$|AbstractRing-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) {{and gray}} gulls (Larus modestus) are two species active both {{by day and}} night. We have {{investigated}} the retinal adaptations that allow the diurnal and nocturnal behaviours of these two species. Electroretinograms and histological analyses show that both species have a duplex retina in which cones outnumber rods, {{but the number of}} rods appears sufficient to provide vision at night. Their retinas respond over the same scotopic dynamic range of 3. 4 logcdm− 2, which encompasses all of the light levels occurring at night in their photic environment. The amplitudes of the scotopic saturated a- and b-wave responses as well as the photopic saturated b-wave response and the photopic sensitivity parameter S are however higher in <b>ring-billed</b> <b>gulls</b> than in gray gulls. Moreover, the process of dark adaptation is about 30 min faster in gray <b>gulls</b> than in <b>ring-billed</b> <b>gulls.</b> Our results suggest that both species have acquired {{in the course of their}} evolution functional adaptations that can be related to their specific photic environment...|$|R

Infection rates in laboratory experiments were high, but intensities were low. Pathology of natural infections in drills is described. The infection lasts at least two years, possibly even for life. Natural infection rates of juvenile herring <b>gulls</b> (Larus argentatus), <b>ring-billed</b> <b>gulls</b> (L. delawarensis), and juvenile laughing gulls (L. atricilla) are reported. Juvenile herring and <b>ring-billed</b> <b>gulls</b> were readily infected experimentally with P. acanthus, juvenile laughing gulls were less susceptible, and nestling least terns (Sterna albifrons) appeared to be resistant.
