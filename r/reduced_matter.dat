As the edifice itself was very large, and mind had so essentially <b>reduced</b> <b>matter</b> in the monikin species, there could not have been less than fifty thousand tails present. Just before the ceremonies commenced, Dr. Reasono approached our tribbune, passing from one to another of the party, saying a pleasant and encouraging word to each, in a way to create high expectations in us all as to what was to follow. We were so very evidently honored and distinguished, that I struggled hard to subdue any unworthy feeling of pride, as unbecoming human meekness, and in order to maintain a philosophical equanimity under the manifestations of respect and gratitude that I knew were about to be lavished upon even the meanest of our party. The Doctor was yet {{in the midst of his}} pointed attentions, when the king's eldest first cousin of the masculine gender entered, and the business of the meeting immediately began. I profited by a short pause, however, to say a few words to my companions. I told them that there would soon be a serious demand on their modesty. We had performed a great and generous exploit, and it did not become us to lessen its merit by betraying a vainglorious self-esteem. I implored them all to take pattern by me; promising, in the end, that their new friends would trebly prize their hardihood, self-denial, and skill.|$|E

Under the pearl rafts, however, the quantities of these constituents have high values in both of the seas. 2) The values of ignition loss are higher in the Sasebo Bay than in the Omura Bay. Under the pearl rafts, however, these values are high, in both of the seas. 3) The ratios of organic carbon to total nitrogen are nearly ten, in the regions rich in organic matters, especially at the estuary of the Hiu, bottoms under the pearl rafts and the inlet of the strait. From the above results, we consider that these constituents are, mainly, derived from sewerages at the ordinary stations and from excretions of pearl oysters under the rafts. According to statistics, we recognize the following relations. 4) The sulfides have positive correlations with the organic carbons and the <b>reducing</b> <b>matters</b> but not with the ignition losses and the total nitrogens. 5) The ignition losses have positive correlations with the total nitrogens and the organic carbons but not with the <b>reducing</b> <b>matters</b> and ratios of organic carbon to total nitrogen. 6) The total nitrogens have positive correlation with the organic carbons and <b>reducing</b> <b>matters...</b>|$|R

40|$|It {{is shown}} that the most unequilibrated {{enstatite}} chondrite, Qingzhen, contains a population of enstatite grains which appear to have formed under more oxidizing nebular conditions than {{the bulk of the}} meteorite, which is highly reduced. These grains are black in transmitted light {{because of the presence of}} micron-sized inclusions of Ni-poor, Cr-rich metal, and occur either isolated within the matrix or in chondrule interiors. The textural occurrence of these grains argues against their having been introduced during collision of Qingzhen with an oxidized meteorite. Most likely, they originated in the same general nebular neighborhood of the reduced bulk Qingzhen material and were subsequently transported into the reducing environment either before or during the process of chondrule formation.

40|$|We {{apply the}} time-renormalization group {{approach}} {{to study the}} effect of primordial non-Gaussianities in the non-linear evolution of cosmological dark matter density perturbations. This method improves the standard perturbation approach by solving renormalization group-like equations governing the dynamics of gravitational instability. The primordial bispectra constructed from the dark matter density contrast and the velocity fields represent initial conditions for the renormalization group flow. We consider local, equilateral and folded shapes for the initial non-Gaussianity and analyze as well the {{case in which the}} non-linear parameter f(NL) parametrizing the strength of the non-Gaussianity depends on the momenta in Fourier space through a power-law relation, the so-called running non-Gaussianity. For the local model of non-Gaussianity we compare our findings for the power-spectrum with those of recent N-body simulations and find that they accurately fit the N-body data up to wave-numbers k similar to 0. 25 h/Mpc at z = 0.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of Fe-containing phases of carbonaceous chondrites heated under various oxidation-reduction conditions was investigated {{by means of}} M 0 ssbauer spectroscopy. Heating of the lower petrological types of chondrites (CM 2) released gases which initially produced oxidizing conditions (N 450 ~ and then reducing conditions (> 700 ~ Phase transformation occurred rapidly (during 1 - 5 minutes) at all temperatures. During heating the Fe-bearing phyllosilicate phases in CM 2 -chondrite converted to Fe-bearing olivine, metallic iron and troilite (pentlandite). These phases resemble those of CO 3, CV 3 and EH-chondrites. Iron distribution resembling that of ordinary chondrites (some additional Fe 2 + in pyroxene) was obtained only by heating a mixture of oxidized matter (CM 2) with <b>reduced</b> <b>matter</b> (EH). A phase transition discovered at 1050 ~ is probably the temperature boundary between conditions of formation of the two main components of ordinary chondrites: matrix and chondrules.

40|$|High Microbial Abundance (HMA) sponges {{constitute}} a guild of suspension-feeding sponges that host vast populations of symbiotic microbes. These symbionts mediate a complex series of biogeochemical transformations that fuel the holobiont’s metabolism. Although sponges are aerobic animals, suboxic and anaerobic bacteria {{are known to}} reside within their bodies. However, {{little is known about}} the chemical characteristics of the sponge environment in which they occur and almost no data are available regarding the dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics inside the holobiont in its natural habitat. In this study we examined the oxygen dynamics in situ in the HMA sponge Theonella swinhoei. A submersed data-logging system equipped with micro-sensors was used to continuously record DO concentrations inside the sponge body and in its outflowing water for up to 48 hours. Actively pumping sponges exhibited high DO removal rates punctuated with short bursts of extreme DO uptake (> 90 µmol DO Lpumped- 1), never before observed in sponges. Such a high DO removal rate indicates the consumption of a considerable amount of <b>reduced</b> <b>matter,</b> far exceeding the available sources in the surrounding water of the oligotrophic coral-reef ecosystem inhabited by this sponge. The inner body of the sponge remained suboxic throughout the experiments, with short events of further rapid DO concentration decline. Moreover, DO concentrations measured in the body and in the outflowing water were found to be uncorrelated. Our findings support a previous hypothesis of bacterial symbiont farming by the sponge as a potential source for acquiring reduced material. Moreover, this suggests a complex and highly localized control of the holobiont’s metabolism, probably associated with the microbial community’s metabolism. Our results indicate that temporal micro-environments exist in the sponge at alternating locations, providing suitable conditions for the activity of its anaerobic microbial symbionts...|$|E

In addition, a voxel-based morphometry analysis based on the segmentation of magnetization transfer parameter maps showed that developmental prosopagnosics also had <b>reduced</b> grey <b>matter</b> volume in the right middle fusiform gyrus and the inferior temporal gyrus.

Grey matter volume in the lateral occipital cortex was associated with component scores related to object recognition tasks.

40|$|The {{objective}} is to evaluate clinical characteristics and cerebral alterations in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with diurnal visual hallucinations (VI-Is). Assessment was performed using magnetic resonance image (MRI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Thirty-nine patients with PD (53. 8 %) and ten controls were studied. Voxel based morphology analysis was performed. Eleven patients presented diurnal VHs and among these, six had cognitive dysfunction. Patients with VHs performed worse in the mentation-related UPDRS I (p = 0. 005) and motor-related UPDRS III (p = 0. 02). Patients with VHs showed significant clusters of <b>reduced</b> grey <b>matter</b> volume compared to controls in the left opercula frontal gyrus and left superior frontal gyrus. PD without hallucinations demonstrated <b>reduced</b> grey <b>matter</b> volume in the left superior frontal gyrus compared to controls. Comparisons between patients with VHs regarding the presence of cognitive dysfunction showed that cases with cognitive dysfunction as compared to those without cognitive dysfunction showed significant clusters of <b>reduced</b> grey <b>matter</b> volume in the left opercular frontal gyrus. Cases without cognitive dysfunction had <b>reduced</b> grey <b>matter</b> substance in the left insula and left trigonal frontal gyrus. judging from our findings, an abnormal frontal cortex, particularly left sided insula, frontal opercular, trigonal frontal gyrus and orbital frontal would make PD patients vulnerable to hallucinations. Compromise of the left operculum distinguished cases with VHs and cognitive dysfunction. Our findings reinforce the theoretical concept of a top-down visual processing in the genesis of VI-Is in PD.
