25|$|Cockatoo {{species have}} a mobile crest of {{feathers}} {{on the top}} of their heads, which they can raise for display, and retract. No other parrots can do so, but the Pacific lorikeets in the genera Vini and Phigys can ruffle the feathers of the crown and nape, and the <b>red-fan</b> <b>parrot</b> (or hawk-headed parrot) has a prominent feather neck frill that it can raise and lower at will. The predominant colour of plumage in parrots is green, though most species have some red or another colour in small quantities. Cockatoos are the main exception to this, having lost the green and blue plumage colours in their evolutionary history; they are now predominately black or white with some red, pink, or yellow. Strong sexual dimorphism in plumage is not typical among parrots, with some notable exceptions, the most striking being the eclectus parrot. However {{it has been shown that}} some parrot species exhibit sexually dimorphic plumage in the ultraviolet spectrum, normally invisible to humans.|$|E
500|$|In 1891, the Italian {{zoologist}} Tommaso Salvadori included Psittacus violaceus in {{a list of}} synonyms of the <b>red-fan</b> <b>parrot</b> (Deroptyus accipitrinus), a South American species. In 1905, the American zoologist Austin Hobart Clark {{pointed out}} that the colouration of the two species was dissimilar (their main similarity being a frill on the neck), and that Buffon stated that the parrot of Guadeloupe was not found in Cayenne where the <b>red-fan</b> <b>parrot</b> lives. Clark instead suggested that the Guadeloupe species was most closely related to the extant, similarly coloured imperial amazon (Amazona imperialis) of Dominica. He therefore placed the Guadeloupe bird in the same genus, with the new combination Amazona violacea, and referred to it by the common name [...] "Guadeloupe parrot". The name Amazona comes from the French word [...] "Amazone", which Buffon had used to refer to parrots from the Amazonian rainforest. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway suggested that the amazon of Guadeloupe may have formed a superspecies with the imperial amazon and the extinct Martinique amazon (Amazona martinicana), and was perhaps a subspecies of the former. He considered it a hypothetical extinct species since it was only known from old accounts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red-fan</b> <b>parrot</b> (Deroptyus accipitrinus), {{also known}} as the hawk-headed parrot, is an unusual New World parrot hailing from the Amazon Rainforest. It is {{the only member of the}} genus Deroptyus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Red-fan</b> <b>parrots,</b> {{although}} not particularly common in aviculture are sometimes kept as aviary birds or companion parrots. While juvenile birds {{tend to be}} docile, adults can be particularly ill-tempered, stubborn, unpredictable and strong-willed birds, showing extreme aggression towards humans and other birds housed with them (including others of their own species and/or their own mates), particularly when in breeding condition. <b>Red-fan</b> <b>parrots,</b> when kept as pets tend to bond with one person and require firm handling and a patient owner, experienced in both bird-keeping and the reading of parrot body language. However, as with all parrots, temperament can vary greatly from individual to individual and some <b>red-fan</b> <b>parrots</b> make excellent companions.|$|R
500|$|Upon graduation, Osman Hill {{continued}} {{his role as}} a lecturer at the University of Birmingham under an apprenticeship until 1930, but teaching anatomy instead of zoology. [...] In 1930, his career took shape when he moved to Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, to become both Chair of Anatomy and Professor of Anatomy at the Ceylon Medical College (more recently named Faculty of Medicine of the University of Colombo or Colombo Medical School). His position allowed him to pursue anthropological studies of the indigenous Veddah people and comparative anatomy of primates. [...] During this time, he began developing a private menagerie of exotic and native species. [...] Consisting mostly of a variety of primates and parrots, the collection reported included several types of cockatoo (family Cacatuidae), <b>red-fan</b> <b>parrots</b> (Deroptyus accipitrinus), eclectus parrots (Eclectus roratus), star tortoises (genus Geochelone), leopard tortoises (Stigmochelys pardalis), Gal√°pagos tortoises (Chelonoidis nigra), and ruddy mongooses (Herpestes smithii). Osman Hill held this position in Ceylon for 14years, returning to the UK after being appointed as Reader in Anthropology at the University of Edinburgh in 1945. Upon his departure from Ceylon, his menagerie was divided between the London Zoo and the National Zoological Gardens of Sri Lanka.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red-fan</b> <b>parrot</b> {{possesses}} elongated {{neck feathers}} {{that can be}} raised to form an elaborate fan, which greatly increases the bird's apparent size, and is possibly used when threatened. It generally lives in undisturbed forest, feeding in the canopy on fruits. It has a dark brown face with white streaks, bare black patch round its brown eye, green wings, flanks and tail and red and blue barred breast.|$|E
