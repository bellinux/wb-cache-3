50|$|Agattu {{has seven}} large seabird colonies, and an {{estimated}} population of 66,000 birds. About 1% of the global population of red-faced cormorants and tufted puffins nest on the island. Other inhabitants include <b>rock</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> red-necked phalarope, gray-crowned rosy finch and snow bunting. Aleutian cackling geese were reintroduced to the island after foxes were eliminated from the island in the 1970s.

40|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> Calidris ptilocnemis {{have the}} most northerly non-breeding {{distribution}} of any shorebird in the Pacific Basin (upper Cook Inlet, Alaska; 61 °N, 151 °W). In terms of freezing temperatures, persistent winds and pervasive ice, this site is the harshest used by shorebirds during winter. We integrated physiological, metabolic, behavioural and environmental aspects of the non-breeding ecology of <b>Rock</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> at the northern extent of their range to determine {{the relative importance of}} these factors in facilitating their unique non-breeding ecology. Not surprisingly, estimated daily energetic demands were greatest during January, the coldest period of winter. These estimates were greatest for foraging birds, and exceeded basal metabolic rates by a factor of 6. 5, a scope of increase that approaches the maximum sustained rate of energetic output by shorebirds during periods of migration, but far exceeds these periods in duration. We assessed the quality of their primary prey, the bivalve Macoma balthica, to determine the daily foraging duration required by <b>Rock</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> to satisfy such energetic demands. Based on size-specific estimates of M. balthica quality, <b>Rock</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> require over 13 h/day of foraging time in upper Cook Inlet in January, even when feeding on the highest quality prey. This range approaches the average daily duration of mudflat availability in this region (c. 18 h), a maximum value that annually decreases due to the accumulation of shore-fast ice. <b>Rock</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> are likely to maximize access to foraging sites by following the exposure of ice-free mudflats across the upper Cook Inlet region and by selecting smaller, higher quality M. balthica to minimize foraging times. Ultimately, this unusual non-breeding ecology relies on the high quality of their prey resources. Compared with other sites across their range, M. balthica from upper Cook Inlet have relatively light shells, potentially the result of the region's depauperate invertebrate predator community. Given the delicate balance between environmental and prey conditions that currently make Cook Inlet a viable wintering area for <b>Rock</b> <b>Sandpipers,</b> small variations in these variables may affect the suitability of the site in the future...|$|R
40|$|At what {{phenotypic}} level do {{closely related}} subspecies {{that live in}} different environments differ with respect to food detection, ingestion and processing? This question motivated an experimental study on <b>rock</b> <b>sandpipers</b> (Calidris ptilocnemis). The species' nonbreeding range spans 20 deg of latitude, the extremes of which are inhabited by two subspecies: C. p. ptilocnemis that winters primarily in upper Cook Inlet, Alaska (61 °N) and C. p. tschuktschorum that overlaps slightly with C. p. ptilocnemis but whose range extends much farther south (~ 40 °N). In view of the strongly contrasting energetic demands of their distinct nonbreeding distributions, we conducted experiments to assess the behavioral, physiological and sensory aspects of foraging and we used the bivalve Macoma balthica for all trials. C. p. ptilocnemis consumed {{a wider range of}} prey sizes, had higher maximum rates of energy intake, processed shell waste at higher maximum rates and handled prey more quickly. Notably, however, the two subspecies did not differ in their abilities to find buried prey. The subspecies were similar in size and had equally sized gizzards, but the more northern ptilocnemis individuals were 10 – 14 % heavier than their same-sex tschuktschorum counterparts. The higher body mass in ptilocnemis probably resulted from hypertrophy of digestive organs (e. g. intestine, liver) related to digestion and nutrient assimilation. Given the previously established equality of the metabolic capacities of the two subspecies, we propose that the high-latitude nonbreeding range of ptilocnemis <b>rock</b> <b>sandpipers</b> is primarily facilitated by digestive (i. e. physiological) aspects of their foraging ecology rather than behavioral or sensory aspects...|$|R
40|$|Shorebirds at {{northern}} latitudes during the nonbreeding season typically carry relatively large lipid stores and exhibit an up-regulation of lean tissues associated with digestion and thermogenesis. Intraspecific variation in these tissues across sites primarily reflects differences in environmental conditions. Rock (Calidris ptilocnemis (Coues, 1873)) and Purple (Calidris maritima (Brunnich, 1764)) sandpipers {{are closely related}} species having the most northerly nonbreeding distributions among shorebirds, living at latitudes up to 61 degrees N in Cook Inlet, Alaska, and up to similar to 71 degrees N in northern Norway, respectively. Cook Inlet is the coldest known site used by nonbreeding shorebirds, and the region's mudflats annually experience extensive coverage of foraging sites by sea and shore-fast ice. Accordingly, <b>Rock</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> increase their fat stores to nearly 20 % of body mass during winter. In contrast, Purple Sandpipers exploit predictably ice-free rocky intertidal foraging sites and maintain low (...|$|R
50|$|The {{burrowing}} {{activities of}} A. pacifica may also cause {{the release of}} methylmercury and other heavy metals from underlying sediments into the water above.

40|$|Abstract. The {{importance}} of climatic {{change on the}} establishment and differentiation of high-latitude species is largely unknown. Biological effects of historic climate change can be determined from historic signals in genetic data. The <b>rock</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (Calidris ptilocnemis) is a good test case for examining these biological effects {{because it has a}} known sister species, the purple sandpiper (Calidris maritima), and it is the only endemic Beringian bird with multiple described subspecies, suggesting a process of initial establishment and subsequent differentiation in the high-latitude regions of Beringia. We sequenced 2, 074 bp of mitochondrial DNA from 40 rock sandpipers from nine breeding locations and four purple sandpipers. We used phylogenetic and coalescence methods to reconstruct trees and to evaluate the population demography, migration rates, and relative times of population divergence. Phylogenetic trees show that purple and rock sandpipers are monophyletic sister species. Within the <b>rock</b> <b>sandpiper,</b> clade branching patterns and coalescence estimates suggest that there were multiple refugial populations in Beringia, which correspond loosely to different glacial cycles. Rock sandpipers show the establishment, persistence, and accumulation of partitioned genetic diversity across several glacial cycles, implicating the presence of multiple cryptic biological refugia in this region through repeated cycles of climate change. 1...|$|E
40|$|We here report two anecdotes about avian {{interactions}} {{relevant to}} the interpretation of differences in shorebird habitat use between day and night. Several studies have reported that shorebirds avoid feeding and roosting along nearshore areas at night yet commonly use these sites during daytime. This suggests that nighttime avoidance of nearshore places {{is a response to}} increased danger of predation. When mist-netting during autumn 2005 on nearshore intertidal habitats along South Spit, Egegik Bay (Alaska Peninsula), Alaska, we discovered that shorebirds that occurred there in large numbers during daytime low tides and roosted there during daytime high tides (especially Dunlin Calidris alpina, <b>Rock</b> <b>Sandpipers</b> Calidris ptilocnemis, Black-bellied Plover Pluvialis squatarola, and Surfbirds Aphriza virgata), were absent at night. Their avoidance of the area correlated with Short-eared Owls Asio flammeus concurrently hunting over the beach and adjacent intertidal habitats. Spotlighting over nearby expansive intertidal mudflats confirmed that the same suite of species continued to forage or roost nearby at night. To bring the story full circle, the morning following one mist-netting effort we found a Short-eared Owl on the beach that had been killed earlier by a Gyrfalcon Falco rusticolus. In the owl’s stomach were remains of a freshly devoured Dunlin. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Rock</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> (Calidris ptilocnemis) is {{endemic to}} the Bering Sea region and unique among {{shorebirds}} in the North Pacific for wintering at high latitudes. The nominate subspecies, the Pribilof <b>Rock</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> (C. p. ptilocnemis), breeds on four isolated {{islands in the}} Bering Sea and appears to spend the winter primarily in Cook Inlet, Alaska. We used a stratified systematic sampling design and line-transect method to survey the entire breeding range of this population during springs 2001 - 2003. Densities were up to four times higher on the uninhabited and more northerly St. Matthew and Hall islands than on St. Paul and St. George islands, which both have small human settlements and introduced reindeer herds. Differences in density, however, appeared to be more related to differences in vegetation than to anthropogenic factors, raising some concern for prospective effects of climate change. We estimated the total population at 19 832 birds (95 % Cl 17 853 - 21 930), ranking it among the smallest of North American shorebird populations. To determine the vulnerability of C. p. ptilocnemis to anthropogenic and stochastic environmental threats, future studies should focus on determining the amount of gene flow among island subpopulations, {{the full extent of}} the subspecies' winter range, and the current trajectory of this small population...|$|E
40|$|We studied <b>Rock</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> (Calidris ptilocnemis) {{breeding}} {{behavior and}} monitored reproductive success from 1998 to 2005 on the Yukon-Kuskokwim River Delta, Alaska, USA. We banded 24 adults and monitored 45 nests. Annual return rate of adults ranged between 67 and 100 %. Six pairs of Rock Sandpipers bred at our study site for ≥ 2 years, and among these {{we did not}} observe mate change (i. e., when both members of a pair returned and each mated with a new individual). Nests were typically initiated by mid-May and 53 % of females laid second clutches if first clutches were lost through mid-June. Males regularly incubated clutches during the morning (0800 – 1259 hrs AKDT) and afternoon (1300 – 1759 hrs) and rarely during the evening (1800 – 2300 hrs), whereas female incubation was relatively consistent throughout the day. Apparent nest success (percent of known nests successfully hatching > 1 chick) among first and second nests was 19 and 44 %, respectively (n = 45). A minimum of 44 % of hatching nests fledged at least one young. Males cared for young but half of females deserted mate and brood 1 – 7 days post-hatch.

40|$|Closely {{related species}} or {{subspecies}} can exhibit metabolic differences that reflect site-specific environmental conditions. Whether such differences represent fixed traits or flexible adjustments to local conditions, however, {{is difficult to}} predict across taxa. The nominate race of <b>Rock</b> <b>Sandpiper</b> (Calidris ptilocnemis) exhibits the most northerly nonbreeding distribution of any shorebird in the North Pacific, being common during winter in cold, dark locations {{as far north as}} upper Cook Inlet, Alaska (61 °N). By contrast, the tschuktschorum subspecies migrates to sites ranging from about 59 °N to more benign locations as far south as ~ 37 °N. These distributional extremes exert contrasting energetic demands, and we measured common metabolic parameters in the two subspecies held under identical laboratory conditions to determine whether differences in these parameters are reflected by their nonbreeding life histories. Basal metabolic rate and thermal conductance did not differ between subspecies, and the subspecies had a similar metabolic response to temperatures below their thermoneutral zone. Relatively low thermal conductance values may, however, reflect intrinsic metabolic adaptations to northerly latitudes. In the absence of differences in basic metabolic parameters, the two subspecies’ nonbreeding distributions will likely be more strongly influenced by adaptations to regional variation in ecological factors such as prey density, prey quality, and foraging habitat. ...|$|E
