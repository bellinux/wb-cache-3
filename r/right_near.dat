5|$|After {{conferring with}} Desaix and Saint-Cyr at Renchen, Moreau mounted his assault on 9 July 1796. This {{decision}} preempted Archduke Charles, who {{had planned to}} attack the French on the 10th. The French commander planned to pin the Austrians in the Rhine plain while turning their left flank among the mountains of the Black Forest. For his part, Charles hoped to outflank the French left near the river and recapture Gernsbach. Latour held the Austrian <b>right</b> <b>near</b> the Rhine, Sztáray was posted in the center near Malsch, Kaim defended the left-center in the hills along the Alb River and Lindt's Saxons held the far left near Neuenbürg.|$|E
5|$|Ithan Creek {{rises in}} a small valley just south of U.S. Route 30 in the {{community}} of Wayne, Pennsylvania. It flows west for several tenths of a mile before receiving its first tributary, Browns Run, from the right and turning south. The creek passes under Pennsylvania Route 320 and receives two small unnamed tributaries from the left. It flows alongside Interstate 476 and crosses it once. After a short while, it receives Kirks Run from the <b>right</b> <b>near</b> the community of Rosemont, Pennsylvania. It flows alongside the interstate for several tenths of a mile before passing under it again. Shortly thereafter, Ithan Creek enters Haverford Township, Pennsylvania and receives its largest tributary, Meadowbrook Run. It passes under Darby Road and meets its confluence with Darby Creek.|$|E
5|$|On {{the southeastern}} {{side of the}} capital city, US127 meets I-96. From this {{interchange}} northward, the freeway is also designated as part of I-496 (Ransom E. Olds Freeway). The I-496/US127 freeway runs northward through suburban Delhi Township and into the city of Lansing. <b>Right</b> <b>near</b> the Red Cedar River, {{just west of the}} Michigan State University campus, I-496 and US127 separate as US127 continues north and I-496 turns west. This side of the city is mostly residential neighborhoods as US127 runs along the East Lansing border, but there is a commercial area surrounding the Lake Lansing Road interchange before the highway crosses into Clinton County. US127 meets I-69 northeast of Lansing, at the 1998–2002 terminus of the highway. From here north, US127 follows the former US27 north to Grayling.|$|E

5|$|Preceding {{attacks by}} Lee's army had done barely {{anything}} to accomplish Confederate objectives, {{but this did}} not deter Magruder, who rode {{back and forth across}} the battlefield, calling for reinforcements and personally launching unit after unit into a charge of the Union line. At this point, men who had always been directly under Magruder's command began to join the battle. Magruder first encountered some units of Brig. Gen. Robert Toombs. With Toombs's brigade widely dispersed, the individual units Magruder found were not with Toombs himself. Magruder personally led the men in a short-lived charge, followed by a disordered retreat. Other units nominally under Toombs's command appeared, charged and retreated at various times throughout the next few hours, with little or no organization. The brigades of Col. George T. Anderson and Col. William Barksdale emerged from the woods to the right of Toombs, but as they did so, Anderson's men also became separated, as the left side outpaced the right. This created an advance with two of Anderson's regiments on the far Confederate left next to Toombs, Barksdale's men in the middle, and three more Anderson regiments on the far <b>right,</b> <b>near</b> the remnants of Wright and Mahone. Anderson's right flank charged, but made it no farther than the foot of the hill before breaking and retreating under a hail of antipersonnel artillery. Anderson's left flank never charged. Barksdale's brigade charged at roughly the same time, and made it considerably farther up the hill, engaging the Union infantry of Brig. Gen. Daniel Butterfield in a firefight that lasted more than an hour.|$|E

25|$|During late 1843 and 1844, Drummond made {{a number}} of {{journeys}} with his son Johnston, who was rapidly becoming a highly respected botanical and zoological collector in his own <b>right.</b> <b>Near</b> the end of 1843, the pair made an expedition to the north and east of Bolgart.

25|$|Napoleon's {{soldiers}} plodded along roads deep in mud from days of rain. The men had {{to suffer}} hunger pangs when the provision wagons failed to turn up. The bogged artillery was only brought forward when the rural inhabitants {{in large numbers}} helped haul the guns through the mud. At first the French population had resigned itself to the Allied invasion, but after suffering {{at the hands of}} the Russians and Prussians, the people were eager to assist the army. On 10 February, as Blücher accompanied the column of Kaptzevich and Kleist while it marched toward Sézanne, the sound of artillery began to rumble ominously to the <b>right</b> <b>near</b> Champaubert.|$|E

Carr tried to score from third, and was gunned down on the relay from Allen to Hawkins to Duncan. Kansas City's only hit in the last three innings was a one-out double by Duncan in {{the top of the}} seventh, so they were unable to catch Hilldale.|$|E

Third (Parke's) Brigade followed after the First. They continued {{until they came}} in contact with enemy pickets, about {{a mile and a half}} (2km) away from the Fort Thompson line held by the Rebels. Daylight having been exhausted, Burnside ordered a halt and had the brigades bivouac in the order of their march: First Brigade on the <b>right</b> <b>near</b> the road, Second Brigade on the left near the railroad, and Third Brigade to the rear of the First.

25|$|Pujara (25) fell on {{the second}} ball of Day 3 and Vijay (68) was gone soon after. But then Virat Kohli and Ajinkya Rahane put on a 77-run {{partnership}} as India were 3/224 at lunch. The pair continued after lunch and built a massive partnership as they both brought up centuries, Kohli's 3rd of the series, as they led India {{all the way to}} tea at 3/336. Another 68 runs were added in the final session before Rahane (147) eventually was dismissed after a 262-run partnership. Debutant KL Rahul (3), MS Dhoni (11) and R Ashwin (0) all fell in quick secession after that as India lost 4/25. Kohli (169) was dismissed <b>right</b> <b>near</b> {{the end of the day}} and the umpires called stumps with India at 8/462, trailing Australia by 68 runs.|$|E
25|$|On 28 November the French army {{advanced}} in three columns against the Prussian position. with Taponier leading the right, Hoche {{the center and}} Ambert the left. Taponier moved against the village of Vogelweh while Ambert aimed to cross the Lauter at Hirschhorn. Taponier's column {{was the first to}} encounter the Prussians and to open the battle, meeting moderate success. The initial attack carried his troops onto the outer ridge of the Hoheneck heights. Taponier also came up against the Galgenberg (Gallows Hill) which was defended by a Prussian redoubt. Alarmed at the march of Ambert's column, Brunswick reacted by sending Kalckreuth north to block it. Kalckreuth's force took a new position with his left flank on the Lauter, his center at Morlautern and his <b>right</b> <b>near</b> Erlenbach. Another division was placed on the Kaiserberg, while Duke Karl August of Saxe-Weimar was left to defend the western approaches to Kaiserslautern.|$|E

25|$|Dense {{bush made}} an attack difficult, because {{observation}} beyond {{a few yards}} was impossible, {{making it difficult to}} maintain direction, provide mutual support or to gain a sufficient field of fire for supporting machine-guns, which would also be limited by the difficulty of transporting ammunition. Bryant decided on an attack from two directions, preceded by a screen of skirmishers. On the <b>right</b> <b>near</b> the railway, the Pioneer and part of G Company of the Gold Coast Regiment and Castaing's French detachment were to advance around the left flank, while the Pioneer Company was to pin down the Germans frontally. Half of C Company, I Company and three guns of the Gold Coast Regiment were to advance around the right flank, while half of C Company pinned down the Germans opposite, the guns giving such support as they could. The half of G Company attacking near the railway was reinforced by seventeen of the French Sénégalais soldiers for the attack.|$|E
