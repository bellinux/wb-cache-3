5|$|From {{the first}} article, {{cataloguing}} {{the rights of}} man, Mason derived the following articles, which make clear that the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> is to secure and protect those rights, and if it fails to do so, the {{people have a right}} to amend or abolish it. Property could not be taken for public use without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives. If accused, a person had the right to a speedy and local trial, based on an accusation made known to him, with the right to call for evidence and witnesses in his favor.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{has been}} {{described}} as conservative and libertarian. According to University of Georgia political scientist Keith Poole, Paul had the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress from 1937 to 2002, and is the most conservative of the candidates that had sought the 2012 Republican nomination for president, on a scale primarily measuring positions on the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in managing the economy– not positions on social issues or foreign policy matters. Other analyses, in which key votes on domestic social issues and foreign policy factor more heavily, have judged Paul much more moderate. The National Journal, for instance, rated Paul only the 145th most conservative member of the House of Representatives (out of 435) based on votes cast in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Due to Song's {{enormous}} {{population growth}} and the body of its appointed scholar-officials being accepted in limited numbers (about 20,000 active officials during the Song period), the larger scholarly gentry class would now take over grassroots affairs on the vast local level. Excluding the scholar-officials in office, this elite social class consisted of exam candidates, examination degree-holders not yet assigned to an official post, local tutors, and retired officials. These learned men, degree-holders, and local elites supervised local affairs and sponsored necessary facilities of local communities; any local magistrate appointed to his office by the government relied upon {{the cooperation of the}} few or many local gentry in the area. For example, the Song government—excluding the educational-reformist government under Emperor Huizong—spared little amount of state revenue to maintain prefectural and county schools; instead, the bulk of the funds for schools was drawn from private financing. This limited <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> officials was a departure from the earlier Tang dynasty (618–907), when the government strictly regulated commercial markets and local affairs; now the government withdrew heavily from regulating commerce and relied upon a mass of local gentry to perform necessary duties in their communities.|$|E

It was underlined that while the concept of multistakeholder cooperation is widely recognized as a vital feature of Internet policy processes, Brazil's intervention at the WTPF was intended to remind everyone that the <b>roles</b> and responsibilities <b>of</b> different stakeholders, particularly <b>of</b> <b>governments,</b> were far from well understood or agreed.|$|R

25|$|In the 1950s, the Republic of China (ROC) government, {{retreated to}} Taiwan {{after losing the}} Chinese Civil War, carried out land reform {{policies}} such as the 375 Rent Reduction. In the 1960s, the agrarian economy was replaced with light industry as small and medium enterprises started to form. From 1966 to 1980, Taiwan's economy was gradually stabilized as the Ten Major Construction Projects laid a foundation in further economic developments. After the 1980s, the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in the economy gradually lessened as many government-owned corporations were privatized.|$|E

25|$|In turn, the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in the {{national}} economy had become associated with the assumption {{by the state of}} the responsibility for assuring its citizens of a degree of economic well-being. The system of economic protection for at-risk citizens sometimes called the welfare state grew out of the Great Depression, which created a popular demand for governmental intervention in the economy, and out of the theoretical contributions of the Keynesian school of economics, which asserted the need for governmental intervention to counter market imperfections.|$|E
25|$|Several {{factors are}} {{associated}} with states' decisions to accept or reject Medicaid expansion {{in accordance with the}} Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Partisan composition of state governments is the most significant factor, with states led primarily by Democrats tending to expand Medicaid and states led primarily by Republicans tending to reject expansion. Other important factors include the generosity of the Medicaid program in a given state prior to 2010, spending on elections by health care providers, and the attitudes people in a given state tend to have about the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> and the perceived beneficiaries of expansion.|$|E
25|$|To promote industrialization, the {{government}} decided that, while it should help private business to allocate resources and to plan, {{the private sector}} was best equipped to stimulate economic growth. The greatest <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> was to help provide the economic conditions in which business could flourish. In short, government {{was to be the}} guide, and business the producer. In the early Meiji period, {{the government}} built factories and shipyards that were sold to entrepreneurs at a fraction of their value. Many of these businesses grew rapidly into the larger conglomerates. Government emerged as chief promoter of private enterprise, enacting a series of pro-business policies.|$|E

25|$|Because the Roman Catholic Church {{had played}} such an {{important}} role in the Reconquista (Christian reconquest) of the Iberian peninsula from the Moors, the Church in essence became another arm of the Spanish government. The Spanish Crown granted it a large role in the administration of the state, and this practice became even more pronounced in the New World, where prelates often assumed the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> officials. In addition to the Church's explicit political role, the Catholic faith became a central part of Spanish identity after the conquest of last Muslim kingdom in the peninsula, the Emirate of Granada, and the expulsion of all Jews who did not convert to Christianity.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{constant}} security threats, Israel—a majorly Jewish state—has thrived economically. Throughout the 1980s and the 1990s {{there were numerous}} liberalization measures: in monetary policy, in domestic capital markets, and in various instruments of governmental interference in economic activity. The <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in the economy was considerably decreased. On the other hand, some governmental economic functions were increased: a national health insurance system was introduced, though private health providers continued to provide health services within the national system. Social welfare payments, such as unemployment benefits, child allowances, old age pensions and minimum income support, were expanded continuously, until they formed a major budgetary expenditure. These transfer payments compensated, to a large extent, for the continuous growth of income inequality, which had moved Israel from among the developed countries with the least income inequality to those with the most.|$|E
25|$|The 1930s {{also saw}} {{a change in the}} <b>role</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> Until then, the state acted {{primarily}} in response {{to the demands of the}} export sector. During the first half of the decade, it was forced to interfere swiftly in an attempt to control the external crisis and to avoid the collapse of the coffee economy; government leaders hoped that the crisis would pass soon and that another export boom would occur. However, with the magnitude and duration of the crisis it became clear that Brazil could no longer rely solely on exports of primary goods and that it was necessary to promote economic diversification. During the Estado Novo, the government made initial attempts at economic planning, and in the late 1930s began to establish the first large government enterprise, an integrated steel mill, Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional.|$|E
50|$|Changes {{occurred}} {{from the}} 1970s to the 1980s.
