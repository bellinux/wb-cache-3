50|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} propagating a tree vegetatively is rooting or taking cuttings. A cutting (usually {{a piece of}} stem of the parent plant) is cut off and stuck into soil.

However, although this works well for some plants (such as figs and olives), for most fruit tree cultivars this method has much too low a success rate to be commercially viable. Root cuttings (pieces of root cut off and induced to grow a new trunk) are also not used to propagate fruit trees, although this method is successful with some herbaceous plants.|$|R

40|$|Since plant root systems capture both {{water and}} {{nutrients}} {{essential for the}} formation of crop yield, there has been renewed biotechnological focus on root system improvement. Although water and nutrient uptake can be facilitated by membrane proteins known as aquaporins and nutrient transporters, respectively, there is a little evidence that root-localised overexpression of these proteins improves plant growth or stress tolerance. Recent work suggests that the major classes of phytohormones are involved not only in regulating aquaporin and nutrient transporter expression and activity, but also in sculpting root system architecture. Root-specific expression of plant and bacterial phytohormone-related genes, using either root-specific or root-inducible promoters or grafting non-transformed plants onto constitutive hormone producing rootstocks, has examined the role of <b>root</b> <b>hormone</b> production in mediating crop stress tolerance.

40|$|AbstractHorticulture is {{the branch}} of {{agriculture}} that deals with science and technology and business of plant cultivation and it {{is considered to be}} the foremost part of the world economy. Even though, one of the major challenges which has seriously influenced the economic loss of horticulture is rooting of cuttings and root growth inhibiting plant pathogens. To address this issue through nanobiotechnology, we ingeniously build a concept of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) as “nano-bullets” can act for a dual mode like root enhancer and pathogen destroyer on the target site. After that, we succeeded in AgNPs synthesis, using two auxin <b>rooting</b> <b>hormones</b> of Indole- 3 -acetic acid and Indole- 3 -butyric acid as a reducing cum stabilizing agent. Further, its efficacy of root promoting and pathogen inhibitory action was sufficiently validated through in vitro and ex vitro studies with model plants and plant pathogens. As a result, the action duality of hormone-stabilized AgNPs was manifested to threefold enhanced root growth compared to controls and it increased the rooting capabilities against root growth inhibiting phytopathogens. This feature was also proved by the direct antifungal assay. Moreover, hormone-AgNPs left no toxicity to treated plants which was revealed by RAPD molecular markers. Therefore, with a detailed study and analysis with instruments such as Spectroscopy, TEM, Zetasizer, FTIR, Cyclic Voltammetry, Fluorescence microscopy (nanoparticles uptake), SEM coupled with EDS (bioaccumulation), TGA (grafting density) and PCR (RAPD analysis), this study can unravel the relevance, scope and current challenges at horticulture plants root development and plant disease management for the sustainable agricultural crop production...|$|R
40|$|Growth, in {{particular}} {{reorganization of the}} root system architecture, mineral homeostasis and <b>root</b> <b>hormone</b> distribution were studied in Arabidopsis thaliana upon copper excess. Five-week-old Arabidopsis plants growing in hydroponics were exposed to different Cu 2 + concentrations (up to 5 μM). Root biomass was more severely inhibited than shoot biomass and Cu was mainly retained in roots. Cu 2 + excess also induced important changes in the ionome. In roots, Mg, Ca, Fe and Zn concentrations increased, whereas K and S decreased. Shoot K, Ca, P, and Mn concentrations decreased upon Cu 2 + exposure. Further, experiments with seedlings vertically grown on agar were carried out to investigate the root architecture changes. Increasing Cu 2 + concentrations (up to 50 μM) reduced the primary root growth and increased the density of short lateral roots. Experiment of split-root system emphasized a local toxicity of Cu 2 + on the root system. Observations of GUS reporter lines suggested changes in auxin and cytokinin accumulations and in mitotic activity within the primary and secondary root tips treated with Cu 2 +. At toxic Cu 2 + concentrations (50 μM), these responses were accompanied by higher root apical meristem death. Contrary to previous reports, growth on high Cu 2 + did not induce an ethylene production. Finally lignin deposition was detected in Cu 2 +-treated roots, probably impacting on the translocation of nutrients. The effects on mineral profile, hormonal status, mitotic activity, cell viability and lignin deposition changes on the Cu 2 +-induced reorganization of the root system architecture are discussed. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Jatropha curcas {{has limited}} natural {{vegetative}} propagation {{and is usually}} propagated by seed.

To address this opportunity, we collected native Populus L. (Salicaceae) and Salix L.

Our objectives were to: 1) identify hormone treatments that enhanced root initiation and early growth of the native genotypes; 2) incorporate Salicaceae prop-agation methodology into phyto-recurrent selection; and 3) establish a population of genotypes {{that can be used}} for afforestation and restoration efforts throughout New York City.
