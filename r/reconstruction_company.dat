40|$|A company {{reconstruction}} is {{an alternative}} procedure, for companies in payment difficulty, to receivership. Those {{in any kind of}} relationship with the ailing company ends up in a dif- ficult situation at a company reconstruction, as in any case when someone is in financial difficulties. Not only is there a risk for the providers not to get paid, the costumers are also at risk if the <b>reconstruction</b> <b>company</b> does not fulfil their agreement. These kinds of rela- tionships are controlled by a contractual relationship. Therefore the regulation has to con- tain how to deal with these contracts when the ailing company no longer can fulfil its obli- gations of the contract. In combination with this, the number of franchise companies is growing in Sweden. Franchise is where a franchisor grants a franchisee intellectual property rights for a fee. In a company reconstruction the franchise relationship becomes another important aspect to take into account because of the degree of dependence between the franchisor and the franchisee. Further the obligations are more comprehensive in the fran- chise agreement than in many other agreements. The question here is how a franchise rela- tionship is affected by a company reconstruction of the other party. This has two perspec- tives; first the contractual relationship between the parties, and second how their coopera- tion affects the end of the reconstruction. The contractual matter in this case is not statutory in Sweden. Therefore analogies are used in these kind of situations. The conclusion of this thesis is that problems occurs and for that reason an extended statutory regarding franchise relationships would be beneficial. On the other hand, the franchise relationship can be beneficial when one of the parties is in a company reconstruction. The close cooperation and support between the parties weighs out the disadvantages in this case. ...|$|E

50|$|Non-performing assets {{had been}} the single largest cause of {{irritation}} of the banking sector of India. Earlier the Narasimham Committee-I had broadly concluded that {{the main reason for}} the reduced profitability of the commercial banks in India was the priority sector lending. The committee had highlighted that 'priority sector lending' was leading to the buildup of non-performing assets of the banks and thus it recommended it to be phased out. Subsequently, the Narasimham Committee-II also highlighted the need for 'zero' non-performing assets for all Indian banks with International presence. The 1998 report further blamed poor credit decisions, behest-lending and cyclical economic factors among other reasons for the buildup of the non-performing assets of these banks to uncomfortably high levels. The Committee recommended creation of Asset Reconstruction Funds or Asset <b>Reconstruction</b> <b>Companies</b> to take over the bad debts of banks, allowing them to start on a clean-slate. The option of recapitalisation through budgetary provisions was ruled out. Overall the committee wanted a proper system to identify and classify NPAs, NPAs to be brought down to 3% by 2002 and for an independent loan review meachnism for improved management of loan portfolios.The committee's recommendations let to introduction of a new legislation which was subsequently implemented as the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 and came into force with effect from 21 June 2002.|$|R
