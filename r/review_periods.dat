40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{variable}} <b>review</b> <b>period</b> model using dynamic programming for order crossover problem. The proposed model {{is compared to}} an existing variable <b>review</b> <b>period</b> model and classical <b>review</b> <b>period</b> in terms of minimum inventory cost. The simulation is applied with six scenarios and sensitivity analysis is also done. The results show a variable <b>review</b> <b>period</b> model performs smaller inventory cost for small variation of lead-time compared to classical <b>review</b> <b>period</b> model. On the other hand, classical periodic review model is sensitive with {{the changes in the}} variation of demand distribution and service level. The proposed model gives the better solution compared to variable <b>review</b> <b>period</b> model for the six scenarios with the inventory cost saving as 11 - 42 %. The sensitivity analysis for a variable <b>review</b> <b>period</b> model and a proposed model are applied and compared. From sensitivity analysis, it can be concluded variable <b>review</b> <b>period</b> with dynamic programming gives the best solution in terms of the changes of holding cost and ordering cost.

50|$|The aims of RADAR are to {{disseminate}} safety reports for serious adverse drug reactions (sADRs) {{and to identify}} barriers to identification and reporting of these clinical events. Investigators have developed a well-coordinated system to accurately compile case report information on sADRs and to identify milestones associated with identification and reporting of the relevant ADR information. This ADR identification system allows us to amass pertinent sADR information from a diverse set of data sources {{in order to identify}} and report sADRs in a timely and thorough manner. With increasingly shortened <b>review</b> <b>periods,</b> postmarketing surveillance for sADRs has become very important. In some instances, initial cases are identified at hospital case conferences and reported to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or to the pharmaceutical manufacturer. The RADAR methodology relies on initial recognition of these “sentinel” cases that then prompts hypothesis-driven inquiries as to whether an unrecognized adverse drug event signal is present in the population of those exposed to that drug.|$|E
40|$|A {{supplier}} stocking {{goods for}} delivery to a retailer may face a finite-horizon service-level agreement. In this context, the service-level agreement is a commitment by a supplier {{to achieve a}} minimum fill rate over a specified time horizon. This kind of service level agreement is an important, but under-studied coordination mechanism. We focus {{on the impact of}} two contract parameters, the length of the review period and the magnitude of the bonus for meeting or exceeding the service-level target. For a supplier following a base stock (order-up-to) inventory policy, increasing the bonus increases optimal supplier stocking levels, while lengthening the review period may increase or decrease optimal stocking levels. We investigate these mechanisms in a controlled laboratory setting and find that longer <b>review</b> <b>periods</b> are generally more effective than shorter <b>review</b> <b>periods</b> in inducing higher stocking levels.

30|$|Some {{efficient}} measures should {{measure the}} ability of the ex ante control chart to detect abnormal behavior of the project progress. For this purpose, three performance assessment measures have been proposed. The first measure is the true alarm rate which refers to the probability of truly detecting an abnormal situation for a particular scenario. This measure defines how many correct signals generate among all <b>review</b> <b>periods</b> available during the project execution. It is calculated by dividing the total number of signals produced by the ex ante control chart to the number of <b>review</b> <b>periods</b> in which one or more activities exist with an ahead-of-schedule or behind-of-schedule situation. The second measure is the false alarm rate which refers to the probability of falsely detecting an abnormal situation. This measure defines how many wrong signals generated among all <b>review</b> <b>periods</b> available during the project execution. A false alarm occurs when a signal is generated even if all the activities are executed as planned.|$|E

40|$|We study a two-echelon serial {{inventory}} {{system with}} stochastic demand. We assume that fixed ordering costs are charged only when an order initiates a non-zero shipment. The system is centrally controlled and ordering decisions {{are based on}} echelon base stock policies. The review period of the upper echelon is an integer multiple of the review period of the lower echelon. We derive an exact analytical expression for the objective function. From this expression, we determine optimal base stock levels and <b>review</b> <b>periods.</b> Through a numerical study we show {{that there may be}} several combinations of optimal <b>review</b> <b>periods</b> and that under high fixed ordering costs both stockpoints have the same order frequency. In addition, we identify parameter settings under which the system behaves like a PUSH-system, where the upstream stockpoint never holds any stock.
