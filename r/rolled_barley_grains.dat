40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the effect of non-protein nitrogen source of urea with <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> (BG) or corn silage (CS) based diet in Holstein bull calves. Nutrient digestibility, rumen fermentation activities, microbial nitrogen yield (MN) and blood metabolites were determined. Holstein bull calves (14), weighing 126 ± 4. 2 kg were allocated in 2 different diets based on BG or CS for 9 weeks. Diets were based on <b>rolled</b> <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> (BG) and on finely chopped corn silage (CS). Both diets were supplemented with 7. 5 g/kg urea on DM basis. Intake and performance of animal did not differ between diets, whereas digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) decreased in BG diet. Ruminal concentration of propionate and blood glucose concentration increased in BG calves, whereas ruminal pH and acetate concentration increased in CS fed calves. The ruminal NH 3 -N was increased in CS diet, while excretions of allantoin, purine derivatives and estimated MN yield through urine were greater in BG diet vs. CS diet. In conclusion, the results suggested that increased urinary PD excretion and consequently increased estimated MN yield value for BG diet presented more potential for this diet to be synchronized with urea in calves’ rumen digestion...|$|R

The control ration averaged 87. 7 % <b>rolled</b> <b>barley</b> <b>grain,</b> 5. 6 % supplement and 6. 8 % barley silage (DM basis) over both trials. Dietary treatments included replacement of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> at 20 or 40 % of the diet (DM basis) with wheat or corn DDGS. For Trial 1, steers were slaughtered at a constant finish weight of 645 kg. Data was analyzed as a completely randomized design using pen as the experimental unit. Feeding increasing levels of wheat DDGS quadratically increased dry matter intake (DMI) (P 0. 05). Feeding both wheat and corn DDGS increased (P= 0. 01) the excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus. Replacement of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> with up to 40 % corn or wheat DDGS improved gain:feed and reduced days on feed, respectively with no detrimental effect on carcass quality grade or sub-primal boneless boxed beef yield.

Proteolytic {{activity}} in ruminal fluid from cattle fed {{two levels of}} barley grain: a comparison of three methods of determination. Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture, 82 (15), 1886 - 1893. The effects of proportion of concentrate in the ruminant diet {{and the effects of}} freezing ruminal content prior to assay on proteolytic {{activity in}} ruminal inoculum were evaluated using three analytical techniques. A novel approach for determining proteolytic activity (PA) of ruminal fluid utilising N- 15 -labelled casein was compared with two published procedures. In a crossover experiment, four heifers were fed two isonitrogenous diets containing (dry matter basis) 50 % barley silage, 45 % <b>rolled</b> <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> and 4 % soybean meal (medium-grain diet, MG) or 8 % barley silage, 89 % <b>rolled</b> <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> and 2 % soybean meal (high-grain diet, HG). Ruminal fluid was analysed either fresh or after having been frozen at - 40 degreesC for 45 days. Substrates utilised in measuring PA included N- 15 -labelled casein (produced by infusing ((NH) -N- 15) (2) SO 4 into the rumen of a lactating dairy cow), C- 14 -labelled casein and azocasein. Incubations were conducted in 0. 2 m phosphate buffer (pH 6. 8) for 20 min at 39 degreesC. In the N- 15 -casein incubations, PA was estimated as (i) N soluble in 5 % trichloroacetic acid (TCASN), (ii) N soluble in 5 % TCA corrected for microbial N uptake (TCAMICR) and (iii) N depleted from the soluble protein N pool (SPR). In the C- 14 -casein incubations, PA was measured as TCA-soluble radioactivity; in the azocasein method it was measured as dye released during incubation. Across treatments the highest (P < 0. 001) proteolytic activity was measured by the SPR method, followed by TCAMICR, TCASN and C- 14 -casein. The lowest activity was recorded using the azocasein method. Within the N- 15 - and C- 14 -casein methods, PA in previously frozen ruminal fluid was higher (P < 0. 05) with the HG diet than with the MG diet, and higher (P < 0. 05) in previously frozen fluid than in inoculum processed fresh. This study demonstrates that increasing the proportion of grain in the diets of cattle and freezing the ruminal inoculum both increase proteolytic activity measured in ruminal fluid. The proposed N- 15 -casein method yielded higher proteolytic activity values than the C- 14 -casein method. Copyright (C) 2002 Society of Chemical Industry.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of supplementing wheat-based dry distillers’ grains with solubles (DDGS) on cow performance, forage utilization, and production costs. In the first two experiments, 48 dry, pregnant Black Angus cows (mean BW±SD; 598. 2 ± 4. 2 kg) stratified by body weight (BW) and days pregnant were allocated randomly to one of three replicated (n= 2) treatments. Cows were managed on stockpiled crested wheatgrass pasture (TDN= 49. 0, CP= 7. 3 (% DM)) in experiment one (EXP 1) and barley straw-chaff residue (TDN= 45. 4, CP= 8. 6 (% DM)) in experiment two (EXP 2). EXP 1 supplement treatments were (1) 100 % DDGS (70 : 30 wheat:corn blend; DDGS); (2) 100 % commercial supplement (COMM); or (3) control– no supplement (CONT). EXP 2 supplement treatments were (1) 100 % DDGS (70 : 30 wheat:corn blend; DDGS); (2) 50 % DDGS + 50 % <b>rolled</b> <b>barley</b> (50 : 50); or (3) 100 % <b>rolled</b> <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> (control; BARL). Forage utilization was measured for both trials using the herbage weight disappearance method. Cow BW, body condition score (BCS), and rib and rump fat were measured at the start and end of trial and cow BW was corrected for conceptus gain based on calving data. There was no effect (P > 0. 05) of treatment on forage utilization in either experiment. In EXP 1, cow performance was not affected (P > 0. 05) by supplement strategy. In EXP 2, BW change was 11. 3, 6. 8, and - 6. 5 (P 0. 41) by treatment. Apparent total tract digestibility of CP was increased (P = 0. 02) by supplementation, but was not different between DDGS, COMM, and BAR+CM treatments. Ruminal pH was not affected (P = 0. 20) by treatment diet, but rumen ammonia-N was increased (P < 0. 01) by supplementation. The potentially degradable and undegradable forage fractions were affected (P < 0. 02) by supplementation, reducing the extent of forage degradation. Also, there was a tendency (P = 0. 06) for the rate of forage DM degradation to increase when supplements were fed. The results of these experiments indicate that wheat-based DDGS can be used as a supplement for beef cows consuming forages with similar or greater effects compared to a commercial pellet and <b>barley</b> <b>grain.</b> DDGS had similar effects on rumen metabolism as the commercial range pellet or <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> and canola meal, suggesting DDGS can be substituted on a unit basis with these supplements. As such, the inclusion of wheat-based DDGS as a supplement for beef cows will depend on the initial price of the supplement...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOur {{objective}} was to evaluate the effects of dietary starch content, altered by partial substitution of dietary grain with wheat dried distillers grain with solubles (DDGS), on the interval from calving to first ovulation, concentrations of hormones and metabolites in plasma and follicular fluid, and granulosa cell gene expression in preovulatory follicles. Sixty lactating dairy cows were assigned to 1 of 2 diets from calving until 84 d postpartum. Diets were formulated to contain either 17. 3 % <b>rolled</b> <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> (29. 2 % starch) or 17. 2 % wheat DDGS (19. 1 % starch), with 43. 0 % barley silage and 21. 6 % rolled corn grain as the other major ingredients (dry matter basis). Transrectal ultrasonography was performed twice weekly to monitor ovarian dynamics from 7 ± 2 d postpartum until ovulation or until 56 d in milk, whichever occurred earlier. Plasma concentrations of insulin and insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1) were determined in all 60 cows, and that of glucose, fatty acids, and urea in a subset of 24 cows, representing those in which the first ovulation occurred spontaneously within 5 wk postpartum. Estradiol (proestrus) and progesterone (12 d postovulation) in plasma were also measured. Concentrations of insulin, IGF- 1, glucose, fatty acids, and urea were determined in follicular fluid (wk 9), and the expression of LH receptor, estrogen receptor β, cytochrome P 450 aromatase, and plasma type glutathione peroxidase genes measured in granulosa cells obtained from the preovulatory follicles at wk 9 postpartum in the subset of 24 cows. Diets did not alter the interval from calving to first ovulation (32. 3 ± 2. 5 d), but a significantly lower proportion of cows on the DDGS diet (20 %) ovulated multiple (≥ 2) follicles at the first ovulation than those on the <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> diet (40 %). The incidence of multiple ovulations tended to be lower at first insemination (10 vs. 21 % for cows fed DDGS and <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> diets, respectively). Mean plasma concentration of insulin was higher in cows fed the <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> diet (2. 5 vs 1. 6 IU/mL), and a diet by time interaction was noted, with cows on the <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> ration having higher insulin from wk 6 to 12 postpartum; however, mean plasma IGF- 1 concentration did not differ between dietary groups. In the subsets, mean plasma concentrations of metabolites or estradiol and progesterone were not affected by diet, parity, or diet by parity interactions. Cows on the DDGS diet had lower concentrations of IGF-I (69 vs. 108 ng/mL) and higher fatty acids (222 vs. 149 mEq/L) in the follicular fluid obtained from preovulatory follicles. Diet, parity, and diet by parity interactions {{did not affect the}} concentrations of insulin, glucose, urea, estradiol, and progesterone in follicular fluid. Diets did not alter the expression profiles of LHr, estrogen receptor β, CYP 19, and GPx 3 genes in granulosa cells. In summary, diets did not affect the interval from calving to first ovulation or granulosa cell gene expression. However, reducing dietary starch content by a partial replacement of dietary grain with wheat DDGS increased fatty acids in follicular fluid and reduced the concentrations of insulin in plasma, IGF- 1 in follicular fluid, and the incidence of multiple ovulations...|$|R

Animal Feed Science and Technology, 118, (1 - 2), 79 - 91. Bacterial protein supply from the rumen is frequently low in animals fed on silage-based diets, partially {{because of the}} lack of rumen available sources of energy. An in vitro experiment was designed to determine the optimum rate of inclusion of <b>rolled</b> <b>barley</b> to optimise rumen efficiency of bacterial protein synthesis (EBPS) of diets comprising a typical ryegrass silage (GR; crude protein (CP) = 139 g/kg dry matter (DM); water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) = 71 g/kg DM; NH 3 ?N = 133 g/kg N; pH 4. 23) or red clover silage (RC; CP = 168 g/kg DM; WSC = 28 g/kg DM; NH 3 ?N = 80 g/kg N; pH 4. 12). Both silages were mixed with increasing proportions of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> (0, 150, 300 and 450 g/kg DM). Treatments were tested using the rumen simulation technique (RUSITEC), replicated in three independent 10 -day incubation periods (blocks). Artificial saliva was infused at a rate of 0. 5 ml/min, and on day 4 of incubation 15 NH 4 SO 4 was added as a microbial marker. Ammonia?N and pH of the effluent were above 50 mg/l and 6. 6, respectively, in all treatments and at all time points measured. Inclusion of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> reduced the effluent concentrations of acetic, propionic and total volatile fatty acids (P ? 0. 06). Apparent digestibilities of DM (DMAD) and organic matter (OMAD) did not differ between RC or GR silages, but RC had lower (P < 0. 001) neutral and acid detergent fibre digestibilities than GR silage. The effluent concentrations of acetic, propionic, butyric and total volatile fatty acids from GR was higher (P < 0. 05) than from RC diets. Inclusion of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> linearly (P < 0. 06) reduced the effluent acetic, propionic and total volatile fatty acid concentrations, but increased DMAD, OMAD and efficiency of bacterial dry matter synthesis (EBDMS). However, there was no clear response in EBPS from GR silage supplemented with barley, but in RC silage, EBPS increased up to a barley inclusion rate of 300 g/kg DM.

40|$|The fibrous barley hull is {{the main}} reason for barley’s low {{available}} energy relative to corn. <b>Barley</b> <b>grain</b> contains hydroxycinnamic acids (mainly ferulic acid (FA) and ñ-coumaric acid (PCA)) which are cross-linked to polysaccharides, therefore, limit cell wall degradability in the rumen. Paricle size of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> also affects the digestion of barley in the rumen. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate a set of barley varieties grown in Saskatchewan (Canada) and provided by Crop Development Center (CDC, Canada) and find a variety with low hull, FA, PCA and fiber content, while maintaining large particle size after mechanical processing, and having high nutrient availability. Three studies were conducted to determine the content of barley hull, FA, PCA, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and acid detergent lignin (ADL) in various barley varities. Mean/median particle size of the <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> after coarse dry-rolling was also determined. The relationships among these parameters and the digestibility of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> in ruminants were then assessed. Six barley varieties (AC Metcalfe, CDC Dolly, McLeod, CDC Helgason, CDC Trey and CDC Cowboy) from samples grown in three years (2003, 2004 and 2005) were evaluated in each study. The first study determined the original content of barley hull, FA, PCA, NDF, ADF, ADL, and mean/median particle size of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> and evaluated the effects of barley variety. The results showed barley variety had a significant impact on the chemical and physical profiles of <b>barley</b> <b>grain,</b> with CDC Helgason and CDC Dolly showing relatively lower content of barley hull, FA, PCA, NDF, ADF, ADL, hemicellulose and cellulose, and moderate mean/median particle size, whereas McLeod and CDC Cowboy showed the opposite. The second study involved two consecutive trials. Trial 1 was to assess differences in the in situ rumen degradability of dry matter (DM), FA, PCA, NDF, ADF and ADL at 12 and 24 h of rumen incubations. Results revealed that CDC Dolly consistently showed relatively lower rumen residues of DM, FA, PCA, NDF, ADF and ADL at 12 and 24 h, with McLeod being opposite. Barley variety displayed some effects on the digestibility of DM, FA, PCA, NDF, ADF and ADL at 12 and 24 h. Since CDC Dolly demonstrated relatively less content of hull, FA, PCA, NDF, ADF, ADL and mean/median particle size and higher rumen digestibility among the six barley varieties, while McLeod was the opposite, CDC Dolly and McLeod were selected for the third trial in order to compare differences in the rumen degradation kinetics of DM, FA and PCA. Trial 2 did not show significant differences in effective degradation of DM, FA, except for PCA. In general, CDC Dolly exhibited better degradability of DM, FA and PCA than McLeod. The third study analyzed the correlation and regression between the original content of barley hull, FA, PCA, NDF, ADF, ADL and mean/median particle size in <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> and rumen residual content of the corresponding parameters at 12 and 24 h of rumen incubation. Results showed that FA content in <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> had a predominantly negative effect on DM degradability, while barley hull content affected the degradability of NDF and ADF. In summary, the present studies show that hull and FA content in <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> have negative effects on the degradability of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> in ruminants and also showed that CDC Dolly could be an ideal feed <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> for ruminants due to its lower hull and FA content and higher rumen dry matter degradability...|$|R

40|$|Malting is the {{controlled}} germination of <b>barley</b> <b>grains,</b> under specific conditions {{and up to}} the point of grain modification, and is the keystone of the brewing and distilling industries.

FPLC based protein fractionation, SDS – PAGE analysis and MALDI – ToF mass spectroscopy were used in an attempt to purify metallo and serine class proteases from extracts of four day micro malted malt and germinating <b>barley</b> <b>grains.</b> A combination of class specific protease inhibitors, germination studies, enzyme assays of both <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> proteases and specific starch degrading enzymes, and western blotting were employed to investigate the roles of the different protease classes in both overall grain physiology during germination and specifically, in the regulation of enzymes involved in starch breakdown.

The control diet (BF 0) included grass silage (460 g kg 1 dry matter) and <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> (540), BF 25 diet included grass silage (460), <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> (405) and BF (135), BF 50 diet included grass silage (460), <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> (270) and BF (270), and BF 75 diet included grass silage (460), <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> (135) and BF (405). At stage 1 there were only two treatments (BF 0 and BF 50) and at stage 2, all four treatments were included. All bulls were fed total mixed ration ad libitum. The mean initial live weight of the bulls was 261 kg and the mean final live weight 650 kg. At stage 1 there were no significant treatment differences in dry matter, energy or protein intakes or in live weight gain. At stage 2, replacing <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> with BF led to a linear decrease of daily live weight gain (P < 0. 05) and a linearly reduced feed conversion (kg dry matter kg 1 live weight gain) (P < 0. 05). The apparent digestibility of the organic matter and neutral detergent fibre decreased linearly with increasing BF supplementation (P < 0. 001). The dressing proportion and the carcass fat score decreased linearly (P < 0. 05) with partial replacement of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> with BF. On carcass conformation, treatment had a significant (P < 0. 05) quadratic effect: the BF 25 and BF 50 diets were classified highest. The results indicate that 50 % of barley starch can be replaced with BF without affecting growth, but feed efficiency factors may decrease when barley starch is replaced with BF. At 75 % replacement, feed intake was reduced, which resulted in a lower energy intake and reduced level of performance. ...|$|R

Results {{showed that the}} extract exhibited high antioxidant activities in vitro and in vivo, evidenced by its ability to chelate ferrous ions, scavenge hydroxyl and superoxide radicals, and prevent lipid peroxidation of liver homogenate. The extract significantly increased the total antioxidant capability (T-AOC) in aged mice (P < 0. 05). The activities of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) increased while levels of malondialodehyde (MDA) and manoamine oxidase (MAO) decreased in both the liver and brain of aged mice treated with the extract compared to the control (untreated mice). The results demonstrate potential antioxidant activities and antiaging effect of roasted <b>barley</b> <b>grain.</b> This provides scientific support {{for the use of}} roasted <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> as an antioxidant against oxidative stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} {{was to determine the}} effect of diversified nitrogen fertilization (0, 25 and 50 kg&# 8226;ha- 1) on selected properties of grains, malts and brewing worts. Brewing value of <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> was determined by Molina-Cano method. It was stated that the higher doses of nitrogen caused an increase of yield, as a result of stronger productive tillering of plants. Significant growth of grain yield was obtained by the in-creasing of nitrogen fertilization from 25 to 50 kg&# 8226;ha- 1. Malts from naked <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> were produced {{in the same way as}} malts of the Pilznen type. According to Molina-Cano method, the naked <b>barley</b> <b>grain</b> of Rastik cultivar was qualified as brewing, because of high malt extractivity.
