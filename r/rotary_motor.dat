5|$|Natural {{selection}} therefore {{explains why}} wheels are an unlikely {{solution to the}} problem of locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing one or more key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; in the evolution of flagella, individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the <b>rotary</b> <b>motor,</b> for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells. This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called exaptation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The <b>rotary</b> <b>motor</b> at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
50|$|As with <b>rotary</b> <b>motors,</b> linear motors {{frequently}} {{run on a}} {{three-phase power}} supply and can support very high speeds. However, there are end-effects that reduce the motor's force, and it is often not possible to fit a gearbox to trade off force and speed. Linear induction motors are thus frequently less energy efficient than normal <b>rotary</b> <b>motors</b> for any given required force output.|$|R
40|$|Molecular motors can {{be defined}} as {{molecules}} that are able to convert any type of energy input (a fuel) into controlled motion.

40|$|Control of the {{direction}} of motion is an essential feature of biological <b>rotary</b> <b>motors</b> and results from the intrinsic chirality of the amino acids from which the motors are made. In synthetic autonomous light-driven <b>rotary</b> <b>motors,</b> point chirality is transferred to helical chirality, and this governs their unidirectional rotation. However, achieving directional rotary motion in an achiral molecular system in an autonomous fashion remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report an achiral molecular motor in which {{the presence of a}} pseudo-asymmetric carbon atom proved to be sufficient for exclusive autonomous disrotary motion of two appended rotor moieties. Isomerization around the two double bonds enables both rotors to move in the same direction with respect to their surroundings-like wheels on an axle-demonstrating that autonomous unidirectional rotary motion can be achieved in a symmetric system...|$|R

50|$|In addition, {{unlike a}} <b>rotary</b> <b>motor,</b> an {{electrodynamic}} levitation force is shown, this is zero at zero slip, {{and gives a}} roughly constant amount of force/gap as slip increases in either direction. This occurs in single sided motors, and levitation will not usually occur when an iron backing plate is used on the secondary, since this causes an attraction that overwhelms the lifting force.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two new light-driven {{molecular}} <b>rotary</b> <b>motors</b> {{based on}} the N-alkylated indanylidene benzopyrrole frameworks are proposed and studied using quantum chemical calculations and nonadiabatic molecular dynamics simulations. These new motors perform pure axial rotation, and the photochemical steps of the rotary cycle are dominated by the fast bond-length-alternation motion that enables ultrafast access to the S 1 /S 0 intersection. The new motors are predicted to display a quantum efficiency {{higher than that of}} the currently available synthetic all-hydrocarbon motors. Remarkably, the quantum efficiency is not governed by the topography (peaked versus sloped) of the minimum-energy conical intersection, whereas the S 1 decay time depends on the topography {{as well as on the}} energy of the intersection relative to the S 1 minimum. It is the axial chirality (helicity), rather than the point chirality, that controls the sense of rotation of the motor. Conversion of the energy of light to directional mechanicalmotion is one of the promising routes to building nanomachines for biological and chemical application. 1 − 3 Light-driven molecular <b>rotary</b> <b>motors</b> (molecular motors, in the following) utilize the photoinduced cis−trans (or E−Z) isomerization of the double bond (to date, CC 4 − 7 an...|$|R
