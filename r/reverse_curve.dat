40|$|Introduction: In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} intrusion mechanics with accentuated and <b>reversed</b> <b>curve</b> of Spee on root resorption of the maxillary and mandibular incisors. Methods: A sample of 60 patients with Class I and Class II Division 1 malocclusions having nonextraction treatment was divided into 2 groups with the following characteristics: group 1 comprised 30 deepbite patients, treated with accentuated and <b>reversed</b> <b>curve</b> of Spee intrusion mechanics, with an initial mean age of 12. 8 +/- 1. 23 years (range, 10. 01 - 15. 32 years), and group 2 comprised 30 patients with normal overbite treated without intrusion mechanics, with an initial mean age of 12. 87 +/- 1. 43 years (range, 10. 02 - 15. 36 years). Pretreatment and posttreatment periapical radiographs were used to evaluate root resorption. The groups were compared by using the Mann-Whitney U test. Correlation between root resorption and tooth movement was investigated with the Spearman correlation coefficient. Results: The deepbite group treated with accentuated and <b>reversed</b> <b>curve</b> of Spee had statistically greater root resorption (1. 87) than the normal overbite group (1. 54), at P=. 017. Changes in overbite and vertical displacements of the maxillary central incisor apices had significant correlations to root resorption (r = 0. 30, P =. 019; r = 0. 27, P =. 037, respectively). Conclusions: Accentuating and <b>reversing</b> the <b>curve</b> of Spee in the archwires to correct deep overbite causes more root resorption than nonintrusive mechanics...|$|R
500|$|Approaching {{the city}} of Glenwood Springs, the highway enters Glenwood Canyon. Both {{the federal and state}} {{departments}} of transportation have praised the engineering achievement required to build the freeway through the narrow gorge while preserving the natural beauty of the canyon.

2500|$|In side profile, turret deck ships resembled other {{merchant}} vessels with flush decks or {{with small}} forecastles and poop decks. In cross-section {{the differences between}} turret deck vessels and more conventional ships are apparent. There was no gunwale; the vertical side of a turret ship curves inward above the load line to a horizontal plane. This flat area {{was known as the}} harbour deck. Further inboard, this [...] "deck" [...] arced to the vertical again by a <b>reverse</b> <b>curve.</b> That vertical plane then joined the weather deck atop the turret at a right angle. Structurally these elements were part of the hull, not of the superstructure, and the cargo holds of the ship extended up to the true weather deck atop the turret.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proposed}} route {{was accepted}} by the Board of Directors of the Boston and Lowell Railroad, and work began on the building phase. The road was begun from both ends at once, and some sources say that they both started on the right hand side of the right-of-way, missing {{in the middle and}} having to put in an embarrassing <b>reverse</b> <b>curve</b> to tide them over until they built the other side. Yankee and Irish laborers were hired to construct the railroad, which was made especially difficult and because the Directors wanted to make the road using the best techniques then known. This, for them, meant laying imported British iron rails with a [...] wall of granite under each rail. They did this because it was commonly believed that the train would sink into the ground if the rails did not have strong support.|$|E

50|$|In economics, the <b>Reverse</b> Laffer <b>curve</b> is a {{representation}} of the relationship between rates of purchasing power provided to purchasers through increased corporate taxation and redistribution leading to levels of increased profit for those corporations.

50|$|From Tank Creek, trains only travel about 1 mi before {{reaching}} Tall Timber Resort. Another mile {{and the train}} is traveling on a very narrow rock wall before rounding the curve and climbing into Cascade. Cascade is two hours and 26 mi by rail from Durango, and in the winter trains are turned here on the wye due to avalanche chutes further up the railroad. After crossing the Animas a third time, the railroad curves {{to the east and}} heads towards Needleton. The grade through here tends to stairstep between short steep 3% grades and longer gradual 2-2.5% while winding through many <b>reverse</b> <b>curves.</b> Unlike the mainline that was constructed by the D&RG before arriving in Durango, the Silverton branch was laid without compensated curves, and the trains can really drag into some of the <b>reverse</b> <b>curves</b> against the engine.

2500|$|The design {{evolved from}} earlier straight-stemmed, long-keel boats into a beamy shallow hull with a {{pronounced}} <b>reverse</b> <b>curve</b> in the midship section and a cut away forefoot. The square tuck stern changed into an immersed elliptical counter, either by evolution or {{adoption of the}} Southport form, the change being complete before 1880. All of the boats had wide side decks and a long cockpit, {{about a third of}} the beam in width, with low freeboard and a low rail to facilitate lifting the gear on board. These shrimp boats, about , were fast and handy in the shallow waters of Morecambe Bay. The larger boats were called “prawners”, though they were actually used to catch pink shrimps (Pandalus montagui). In addition to the larger prawner (called [...] "sprawner" [...] at Morecambe) a subtype called [...] "bay boat" [...] developed for the holiday trade. The bay boat had a shallow draft so it could operate around Grange-over-Sands at the head of Morecambe Bay.|$|E
