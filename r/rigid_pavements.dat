50|$|One major design {{consideration}} of <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> is reducing fatigue failure {{due to the}} repeated stresses of traffic. Fatigue failure is common among major roads because a typical highway will experience millions of wheel passes throughout its service life. In addition to design criteria such as traffic loadings, tensile stresses due to thermal energy {{must also be taken}} into consideration. As pavement design has progressed, many highway engineers have noted that thermally induced stresses in <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> can be just as intense as those imposed by wheel loadings. Due to the relatively low tensile strength of concrete, thermal stresses are extremely important to the design considerations of <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements.</b>|$|E

50|$|The overall {{purpose of}} highway {{maintenance}} is to fix defects {{and preserve the}} pavement's structure and serviceability.

50|$|Portland cement {{concrete}} (PCC) {{is the most}} common material used in the construction of rigid pavement slabs. The reason for its popularity is due to its availability and the economy. <b>Rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> must be designed to endure frequently repeated traffic loadings.

30|$|Paved {{roads are}} {{typically}} categorized {{as either a}} flexible or <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> system. Sometimes, {{as part of the}} reclamation, the old road is not completely removed prior to construction of the new road and is referred to as a composite pavement [60]. The major difference between flexible and <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> systems is the application of a bituminous surface layer (e.g., asphalt layer) in a flexible pavement or a Portland cement concrete layer in a <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> system. In general, regardless of the type, pavement systems are constructed with the highest quality materials on the top where traffic stresses are greatest [60]. The thickness of the layers within the pavement system will typically decrease as constructed over subgrade due to the increased cost of the materials.|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{adequacy of}} a <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> can normally be predicted {{based on its}} structural response to the applied loads. While considerable knowledge of pavement behaviour under static loads is available word-wide, only very limited {{number of studies have}} been carried out in the past to determine the effect of dynamic loads on <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> deteriorations. Hence, opinions differ as to which type of load (static or dynamic) results in greater values of base deflection or flexural stress. In the present study, a <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> test section consisting of two jointed reinforced concrete pavements and two jointed plain (unreinforced) concrete pavements was constructed and tested under both quasi-static and dynamic truck loads. Truck load was allowed to wander at predetermined locations on top of the instrumented pavement. Nominal speeds from 5 km/h to 55 km/h were used in the study. Various devices including strain gauges, displacement transducers, vertical accelerometers and thermocouples were installed at different depths along the test section.

50|$|<b>Rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> are {{generally}} constructed in three layers - a prepared subgrade, base or subbase, and a concrete slab. The concrete slab is constructed {{according to a}} designed choice of plan dimensions for the slab panels, directly influencing the intensity of thermal stresses occurring within the pavement. In addition to the slab panels, temperature reinforcements must be designed to control cracking behavior in the slab. Joint spacing {{is determined by the}} slab panel dimensions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> are {{generally}} used in constructing airports and major highways, {{such as those}} in the interstate highway system. In addition, they commonly serve as heavy-duty industrial floor slabs, port and harbor yard pavements, and heavy-vehicle park or terminal pavements. Like flexible pavements, rigid highway pavements are designed as all-weather, long-lasting structures to serve modern day high-speed traffic. Offering high quality riding surfaces for safe vehicular travel, they function as structural layers to distribute vehicular wheel loads in such a manner that the induced stresses transmitted to the subgrade soil are of acceptable magnitudes.|$|E
50|$|Near {{the end of}} a rigid pavement's service life, a {{decision}} must be made to either fully reconstruct the worn pavement, or construct an overlay layer. Considering an overlay can be constructed on a rigid pavement that has not reached the end of its service life, it is often more economically attractive to apply overlay layers more frequently. The required overlay thickness for a structurally sound rigid pavement is much smaller than for one that has reached the end of its service life. Rigid and flexible overlays are both used for rehabilitation of <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> such as JPCP, JRCP, and CRCP.|$|E

From the preliminary waste named as hypo sludge, due to its low calcium is taken out to replace the cement in concrete. Major initiatives are needed in India to use these large volumes in construction industry especially in <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> construction and other infrastructure projects. Moreover Use of Hypo Sludge in construction of <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> will improve transportation functionality and ecological sustainability and results in improved traffic safety and reduced life-cycle cost. Use of Hypo Sludge in construction of <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> will benefit urban growth, public health and surrounding communities by encouraging smart growth by integrating and guiding future growth.

40|$|Basically, {{construction}} of road pavement has 2 (two) types, are <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> and flexible <b>pavement.</b> <b>Rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> has many advantages: {{the design is}} simple, the maintenance is easy and it is suitable for heavy load traffic {{as well as for}} sub grade with low CBR value However, the main disadvantage of <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> is its inflexibility because the flexural strength of concrete is low. To increase the flexibility of concrete, adding elastic material (waste tire) into concrete mixture is needed. This is very possible, because waste tire has high modulus of elasticity value and low density. This research is conducted to find the influence of waste tire fiber addition towards the increase of flexural strength and compressive strength of <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement.</b> This research uses tire shreds 4 mm x 4 mm x 60 in mm size which are mixed randomly into various concentrations. Concrete mechanic behaviors, flexural strength and compressive strength, are measured by testing cylinder and beam concrete specimens.

50|$|The {{wearing course}} is the upper layer in roadway, airfield, and {{dockyard}} construction. The term 'surface course' is sometimes used, however this term is slightly different {{as it can be}} used to describe very thin surface layers such as chip seal. In <b>rigid</b> <b>pavements</b> the upper layer is a portland cement concrete slab. In flexible pavements, the upper layer consists of asphalt concrete, that is a construction aggregate with a bituminous binder. The wearing course is typically placed on the binder coarse which is then laid on the base course, which is normally placed on the subbase, which rests on the subgrade. There are various different types of flexible pavement wearing course, suitable for different situations. Stone mastic asphalt is a type of flexible pavement wearing course which is typically used for heavily trafficked roads.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> is {{frequently}} misunderstood form of construction. Many people assume that <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> is costly and not effective. However, {{it has been}} proven that it is good in term of the strength and durability to cater high traffic load compare to flexible pavement. However, {{in order to have}} good <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement,</b> the design procedures of the pavement should be properly applied. The vital issue in pavement design is thickness. There are two main approaches of design the <b>rigid</b> <b>pavement</b> thickness which are Portland Cement Association (PCA) method and American Association of States Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) method. However, both methods are difficult to conduct manually and may produce inaccurate result. The difficulties can be expressed in term of time consuming and tedious calculation.
