Bart <b>rolls</b> <b>out</b> the first issue of Angry Dad, which becomes a hit with the kids in school. During an autograph signing session in the schoolyard, Bart is approached by a spokesman for an Internet entertainment site.

25|$|After Kim Schneider <b>rolls</b> <b>out</b> on {{her second}} shot hit, Kaitlyn Lawes {{responds}} by hitting it a sitting two for Canada. Holland's final shot {{is a long}} double, which she jams leaving Canada sitting one. Jennifer Jones draws to an open house for her second point.|$|E
25|$|While {{a normal}} leg break spins from the leg to the off side, {{away from a}} {{right-handed}} batsman, a googly spins the other way, from off to leg, into a right-handed batsman (and is distinct from an off break delivery). The bowler achieves this change of spin by bending the wrist sharply from the normal leg break delivery position. When the ball <b>rolls</b> <b>out</b> of the hand (from the side near the little finger, as in a normal leg break), it emerges with clockwise spin (from the bowler's point of view). A googly may also be achieved by bowling the ball as a conventional leg break, but spinning the ball further with the fingers just before it is released.|$|E
25|$|In {{hopes of}} {{stealing}} a victory, Amber Holland opts {{to utilize the}} four rock rule, by having lead Heather Kalenchuk place a high centre line guard on her first rock. Jones responds by having lead Dawn Askin throw a rock in the rings to have the possible winning point. Holland calls for Kalenchuk to throw a tight guard to utilize the four rock rule once again, but she is heavy and it lands in the 12ft, in front of Askin's rock. This gives Canada the permission to remove it, which Jones asks Askin to do. However, Askin flashes her stone, missing everything entirely. Tammy Schneider then places a tight guard for Saskatchewan. At this point, Canada can start removing guards, and Jill Officer can now remove the high guard, which she peels off. Tammy Schneider then replaces it, and it is once again removed by Officer. Kim Schneider then puts up another high centre line guard, but it is removed Kaitlyn Lawes. Kim Schneider on her second rock comes a bit heavy, ending up as a halfway guard. Jones opts to have Lawes remove it as well. At this point, Amber Holland decides to make her move by coming around the tight guard placed by Tammy Schneider. Her rock has good weight, {{but it is too}} far outside, and the entire rock is visible for Jennifer Jones to remove, and even roll in for shot. Jones does remove the stone, but instead <b>rolls</b> <b>out</b> to the 12ft. On her final stone, Holland makes a perfect come around, landing on the button. This leaves Jones with a double run back on to it for the win. Jones almost makes the shot, but the Canada rock rolls further than the Saskatchewan rock, giving the title to Saskatchewan {{for the first time since}} 1997.|$|E
