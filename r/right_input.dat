50|$|Quantification is {{not universally}} {{implemented}} in Rete engines, and, {{where it is}} supported, several variations exist. A variant of existential quantification referred to as negation is widely, though not universally, supported, and is described in seminal documents. Existentially negated conditions and conjunctions involve the use of specialised beta nodes that test for non-existence of matching WMEs or sets of WMEs. These nodes propagate WME lists only when no match is found. The exact implementation of negation varies. In one approach, the node maintains a simple count on each WME list it receives from its left input. The count specifies the number of matches found with WMEs received from the <b>right</b> <b>input.</b> The node only propagates WME lists whose count is zero. In another approach, the node maintains an additional memory on each WME list received from the left input. These memories are a form of beta memory, and store WME lists for each match with WMEs received on the <b>right</b> <b>input.</b> If a WME list {{does not have any}} WME lists in its memory, it is propagated down the network. In this approach, negation nodes generally activate further beta nodes directly, rather than storing their output in an additional beta memory. Negation nodes provide a form of 'negation as failure'.|$|E

40|$|Sound {{localization}} requires {{comparison between}} the inputs {{to the left and}} right ears. One important aspect of this comparison is the differences in arrival time to each side, also called interaural time difference (ITD). A prevalent model of ITD detection, consisting of delay lines and coincidence-detector neurons, was proposed by Jeffress (J Comp Physiol Psychol 41 : 35 – 39, 1948). As an extension of the Jeffress model, the process of detecting and encoding ITD has been compared to an effective cross-correlation between the input signals to the two ears. Because the cochlea performs a spectrotemporal decomposition of the input signal, this cross-correlation takes place over narrow frequency bands. Since the cochlear tonotopy is arranged in series, sounds of different frequencies will trigger neural activity with different temporal delays. Thus, the matching of the frequency tuning of the left and <b>right</b> <b>inputs</b> to the cross-correlator units becomes a ‘timing’ issue. These properties of auditory transduction gave theoretical support to an alternative model of ITD-detection based on a bilateral mismatch in frequency tuning, called the ‘stereausis’ model. Here we first review the current literature on the owl’s nucleus laminaris, the equivalent to the medial superior olive of mammals, which is the site where ITD is detected. Subsequently, we use reverse correlation analysis and stimulation with uncorrelated sounds to extract the effective monaural inputs to the cross-correlator neurons. We show that when the left and <b>right</b> <b>inputs</b> to the cross-correlators are defined in this manner, the computation performed by coincidence-detector neurons satisfies conditions of cross-correlation theory. We also show that the spectra of left and <b>right</b> <b>inputs</b> are matched, which is consistent with predictions made by the classic model put forth by Jeffress...|$|R

For concreteness of analysis, a concurrency control protocol based on Thomas' Majority Consensus protocol and the Two-Phase Commit Protocol is used. A new performance measure called expected system degradation is proposed; this measure is a combination of availability of data and the transaction response time; this is the first step towards the ultimate goal of defining the notion of availability for real-time transaction systems.

40|$|Leveraging topos theory a {{semantics}} can {{be given}} to sequential circuits where time-sensitive gates, such as unit delay, are treated uniformly with combinational gates. Both kinds of gates are functions in a particular topos: the topos of presheaves over the natural ordering of N. This is used to show that sequential circuits validate the equational theory of traced categories. When giving semantics to circuits (typically boolean circuits), it is customary to treat the combinational – i. e. time-independent – parts of the circuits differently from time sensitive ones. Since it is usually assumed that the only time-sensitive gate is the unit delay, each outgoing wire from a delay is considered an additional input, and each incoming wire an additional output. Some care is taken to feed the right output into the <b>right</b> <b>input</b> at next iteration, and so time-sensitivity is eliminated and one can reason on a purely combinational circuit...|$|E

The key idea is to properly select and coordinate the two sequences of TV deterministic configurations used by the two stages of switch fabrics, thereby forming a joint sequence with both staggered symmetry property and in-order packet delivery property. With a single-packet-buffer-per-middle-stage VOQ, a joint sequence with both properties is first constructed.
