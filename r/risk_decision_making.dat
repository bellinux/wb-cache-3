40|$|Coastal {{hazards and}} their {{associated}} risks {{are not new}} to coastal managers, engineers and planners. As an island nation {{the coast of the}} United Kingdom (UK) has been an attractive area for settlement for centuries. Consequently, a substantial proportion of urban development in the UK is at risk of flooding or coastal erosion. Traditional responses to coastal hazards across Europe have been based upon reactive, parochial hard engineering structural solutions in order to protect assets at risk. These practices have been predominantly sectoral due to fragmented institutional arrangements, with limited integration between the sectors of shoreline management and the land-use planning system. Additionally, historic coastal <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> has shown little understanding of the complexities of coastal systems. Whilst within contemporary coastal <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making,</b> there is limited transparency as to the role of natural coastal change. Levels of uncertainty exacerbate the complex task of managing coastal risk, in particular in relation to the natural coastal change evidence base. Using a multiple-case study approach, decision making practices in relation to coastal risk in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were evaluated. Concomitantly, the role of the natural coastal change evidence base within these decision making processes was scrutinised. Research investigations were facilitated via the development of two distinct and innovative methodological approaches that framed and guided two semi-structured interview schedules and a number of documentary reviews. This deductive process included a case study selection hypothesis and a Research Strategy Model (with Empirical Indicators). Case study results established the complexities associated with coastal <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making,</b> including historic, contemporary and likely future decision making practices. In particular, the range of decision makers involved and the hierarchical and framed nature of decision making were identified. Importantly, traceable coastal <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> relationships that exist temporally, spatially and sectorally were ascertained. Forcing factors or 'context issues' that influence these decision making practices were highlighted. It was further determined that the role of natural coastal change science, as part of the coastal <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> evidence is constrained. This was found to be due to a number of issues, including the perpetuation of the science-practice disconnect, aggravated by natural coastal change scientific uncertainty. Through analysis of empirical findings and consideration of the underlying case study hypothesis and previous construction of decision making, a conceptualisation of coastal <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> was developed. This seeks to convey hypothetical stages of coastal <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> pathways and convey the wider complex decision context, including intricate pathway connections. A revised suite of supporting Empirical Indicators allows for a structured and comprehensive assessment of decision making, and importantly, a mechanism by which to explore the role of science within coastal <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Constructive {{critical}} {{discussion of}} risk issues between risk stakeholders should {{improve the quality}} of business decisions. This {{is one of the reasons}} why most financial organisations employ risk managers to assist business in such decisions. Role differences between risk managers and business decision makers in the decision making processes can be expected to attract people with role-compatible characteristics and personality types. Related personality-based differences in approach to risk-related questions should add to the quality of business decisions. This exploratory study investigated whether the typical personality traits and <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> propensity of risk managers and business decision makers differ in the personal wealth management division of a large financial services organisation. A three-phased mixed-method exploratory research approach was used to investigate this question. The first phase consisted of 10 semi-structured one-on-one interviews with risk stakeholders at management level in the organisation. The aim of the interviews was to gain an understanding of conflict situations that arose due to risk decision taken. In the second phase, this information was used to design and develop seven scenario-based <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> vignettes. In the third phase, a. sample of 138 risk managers and decision makers completed the HEXACO PI-R 60 -item personality inventory and the <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> vignettes. The application of scenario-based <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> vignettes to study risk stakeholder decisions is new to the financial sector. Despite our initial expectations, the personality traits and <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> propensity did not significantly differ between the risk and decision making groups. This result indicates that unfounded expectations of difference in approach between risk role-players may give management a false sense of comfort that risk managers are effectively challenging risk decisions taken by business decision makers. The research findings have implications for risk management and recruitment practices for organisations that rely on risk managers making a valuable contribution to business decisions. Master...|$|E

40|$|Background: Risk aversion is {{associated}} with many important decisions among younger and middle aged persons, but the association of <b>risk</b> aversion and <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> has not been well studied among older persons who face {{some of the most}} significant decisions of their lives. Method: Using data from 606 community-dwelling older persons without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, an ongoing longitudinal epidemiologic study of aging, we examined the association of <b>risk</b> aversion with <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> <b>Risk</b> aversion was measured using standard behavioral economics questions in which participants were asked to choose between a certain monetary payment ($ 15) versus a gamble in which they could gain more than $ 15 or gain nothing; potential gamble gains ranged from $ 20 to $ 300 with the gain amounts varied randomly over questions. <b>Decision</b> <b>making</b> was measured using a 12 item version of the <b>Decision</b> <b>Making</b> Competence Assessment Tool. Findings: In a linear regression model adjusted for age, sex, education, and income, greater risk aversion was associated with poorer <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> (estimate=- 1. 03, standard error (SE) = 0. 35, p= 0. 003).

40|$|Cognitive and biopsychological {{research}} has identified {{a significant relationship}} between perception, decision making and the negative consequences associated with sustained gambling. Drug and alcohol research suggests that how individuals navigate decisions involving motivating but risky activities involves several important, distinct, but interrelated aspects of cognition. Nevertheless, risk perception and decision making has received little attention in the gambling literature. The aim of the current thesis therefore was to investigate risk perception in gambling, and to develop a model of gambling decision making mindful of risk perception concepts. The project applied the Mental Models methodology and included: a literature review, a qualitative study evaluating expert opinions regarding gambling <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making,</b> a second qualitative study evaluating lay gambler mental models of risk, and a quantitative evaluation of risk perception and decision making concepts via a self-report questionnaire. Data from all phases of the project were used to develop an assessment tool (Gambling Risk Decisions Questionnaire) and theoretical model of gambling <b>risk</b> <b>decision</b> <b>making.</b> It was anticipated that understanding the processes by which risk perception predisposes an individual to maintain gambling despite adverse consequences would act as an invaluable guide for preventative educational campaigns, clinical treatment, and social policy interventions. Taken together, results of the four studies confirmed the importance of relationships between decision making, behaviour, consequences, and disorder, with disorder largely predictable based on several core decision making factors, despite individual variation in clinical presentation...|$|E
