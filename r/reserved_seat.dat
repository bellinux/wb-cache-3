25|$|While the mutants demand {{desegregation}} {{and equal}} rights from Mayor Poopenmeyer, Astor tries {{to force them}} back underground using a wave of sewage held in Madison Cube Garden, but Fry uses the 's energy to part the wave and defend the mutants. He shows the mayor and Astor the Land Titanic passenger manifest, which includes Leela's maternal grandmother, {{who worked on the}} Land Titanic when it sunk. Leela's grandmother explains that Astor's husband gave up his <b>reserved</b> <b>seat</b> on the life car for her and her mother. The widowed Astor is moved and urges Mayor Poopenmeyer to support mutant equality. As he and Leela kiss over their victory, Fry's grotesque form melts away, revealing itself to be Astor's mutated husband who fell into the toxic lake and survived as the Land Titanic sunk; Fry had unknowingly lodged himself in the mutant's mouth. The Astors happily reunite, and the Planet Express crew throw another party in celebration together with Leela's family, who are now allowed access to the surface.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{relationship}} between <b>reserved</b> <b>seats</b> for ethnic groups in national legislatures and corruption. In 2008, over 30 countries were <b>reserving</b> <b>seats</b> for ethnic groups in their national legislature. The share of <b>seats</b> that was <b>reserved</b> ranged from a 2 percent <b>reserved</b> <b>seats</b> arrangement for a small ethnic minority, to a 100 percent <b>reserved</b> <b>seats</b> power-sharing arrangement between two or more ethnic groups. By applying theories of informal power, this essay hypothesizes that <b>reserving</b> <b>seats</b> reduces corruption. In contrast to the theory, an initial bivariate regression shows that <b>reserved</b> <b>seats</b> are associated with higher levels of corruption. However, when controlling for conflict history, democracy, ethnic fractionalization, GDP/capita, fuel exports, newspaper circulation, and region, this association turns into a negative one, indicating that <b>reserved</b> <b>seats</b> might reduce corruption. The main finding of the study is that having less than 25 percent of the total amount of legislative <b>seats</b> <b>reserved</b> for ethnic groups reduces corruption more than having no <b>reserved</b> <b>seats</b> at all or more than 25 percent <b>reserved</b> <b>seats.</b> This suggests that certain types of <b>reserved</b> <b>seats</b> arrangements are useful for fighting corruption. ...|$|R

2500|$|On December 26, 2010, the Philadelphia Eagles {{home game}} against the visiting Minnesota Vikings was {{postponed}} before any snow had fallen due to an impending blizzard in Philadelphia.

2500|$|Authors Donald Freed and Raymond Briggs {{claimed in}} Killing Time (1996), their {{book about the}} Simpson case, that an unnamed source told them that while Nigg had lived in Colorado, {{he was known to}} law {{enforcement}} there to be [...] "involved in the narcotics culture" [...] in Aspen (where another branch of Mezzaluna is located) and Denver. According to journalist Joseph Bosco, who had a <b>reserved</b> <b>seat</b> at the entire trial, Nigg [...] "lived beyond his apparent means", driving a Mercedes and living in a luxury condominium while ostensibly deriving most of his income from waiting tables and occasional low-level acting jobs. Freed and Briggs, among others, have also observed that the circumstances of the killing seem to suggest the assailants' true intent was to kill Nigg rather than rob him. Moreover, Nigg and Goldman were not the only Mezzaluna waiters who had fallen victim to foul play around that time: two others were missing, and a third had his car destroyed by fire in Corona del Mar during 1994.|$|E

A few evenings after that, I was at that copy of {{a copy of a}} tournament, and, a few gradines below me, I saw the man of the Prince Albert coat and the derby hat. I had already made up my mind that he was an American, for I supposed that an Englishman would rather perish than wear such a coat with such a hat, and as I had wished all my life to speak to a circus-man, I went down and boldly accosted him. [...] "Are you a brother Yankee?" [...] I asked, and he laughed, and confessed that he was an Englishman, but he said he was glad to meet any one who spoke English, and he made a place for me by his side. He was very willing to tell how he happened to be there, and he explained that he was the manager of a circus, which had been playing to very good business all winter in Spain. In an evil hour he decided to come to Italy, but he found the prices so ruinously low that he was forced to disband his company. This diving girl was all that remained to him of its many attractions, and he was {{trying to make a living}} for both in a country where the admission to a circus was six of our cents, with fifty for a <b>reserved</b> <b>seat.</b> But he was about to give it up and come to America, where he said Barnum had offered him an engagement. I hope he found it profitable, and is long since an American citizen, with as good right as any of us to wear a Prince Albert coat with a derby hat.|$|E
6000|$|Here we {{may return}} to the {{narrative}} called The Acts of the Apostles, which we left {{at the point where}} the stoning of Stephen was followed by the introduction of Paul. The author of The Acts, though a good story-teller, like Luke, was (herein also like Luke) much weaker in power of thought than in imaginative literary art. Hence we find Luke credited with the authorship of The Acts by people who like stories and have no aptitude for theology, whilst the book itself is denounced as spurious by Pauline theologians because Paul, and indeed all the apostles, are represented in it as very commonplace revivalists, interesting us by their adventures more than by any qualities of mind or character. Indeed, but for the epistles, we should have a very poor opinion of the apostles. Paul in particular is described as setting a fashion which has remained in continual use to this day. Whenever he addresses an audience, he dwells with great zest on his misdeeds before his pseudo conversion, with the effect of throwing into stronger relief his present state of blessedness; and he tells the story of that conversion over and over again, ending with exhortations to the hearers to come and be saved, and threats of the wrath that will overtake them if they refuse. At any revival meeting today the same thing may be heard, followed by the same conversions. This is natural enough; but it is totally unlike the preaching of Jesus, who never talked about his personal history, and never [...] "worked up" [...] an audience to hysteria. It aims at a purely nervous effect; it brings no enlightenment; the most ignorant man has only to become intoxicated with his own vanity, and mistake his self-satisfaction for the Holy Ghost, to become qualified as an apostle; and it has absolutely nothing to do with the characteristic doctrines of Jesus. The Holy Ghost may be at work all round producing wonders of art and science, and strengthening men to endure all sorts of martyrdoms for the enlargement of knowledge, and the enrichment and intensification of life ("that ye may have life more abundantly"); but the apostles, as described in The Acts, take no part in the struggle except as persecutors and revilers. To this day, when their successors get the upper hand, as in Geneva (Knox's [...] "perfect city of Christ") and in Scotland and Ulster, every spiritual activity but moneymaking and churchgoing is stamped out; heretics are ruthlessly persecuted; and such pleasures as money can purchase are suppressed so that its possessors are compelled to go on making money because there is nothing else to do. And the compensation for all this privation is partly an insane conceit of being the elect of God, with a <b>reserved</b> <b>seat</b> in heaven, and partly, since even the most infatuated idiot cannot spend his life admiring himself, the less innocent excitement of punishing other people for not admiring him, and the nosing out of the sins of the people who, being intelligent enough to be incapable of mere dull self-righteousness, and highly susceptible to the beauty and interest of the real workings of the Holy Ghost, try to live more rational and abundant lives. The abominable amusement of terrifying children with threats of hell is another of these diversions, and perhaps the vilest and most mischievous of them. The net result is that the imitators of the apostles, whether they are called Holy Willies or Stigginses in derision, or, in admiration, Puritans or saints, are, outside their own congregations, and to a considerable extent inside them, heartily detested. Now nobody detests Jesus, though many who have been tormented in their childhood in his name include him in their general loathing of everything connected with the word religion; whilst others, who know him only by misrepresentation as a sentimental pacifist and an ascetic, include him in their general dislike of that type of character. In the same way a student who has had to [...] "get up" [...] Shakespear as a college subject may hate Shakespear; and people who dislike the theatre may include Moliere in that dislike without ever having read a line of his or witnessed one of his plays; but nobody with any knowledge of Shakespear or Moliere could possibly detest them, or read without pity and horror a description of their being insulted, tortured, and killed. And the same is true of Jesus. But it requires the most strenuous effort of conscience to refrain from crying [...] "Serve him right" [...] when we read of the stoning of Stephen; and nobody has ever cared twopence about the martyrdom of Peter: many better men have died worse deaths: for example, honest Hugh Latimer, who was burned by us, was worth fifty Stephens and a dozen Peters. One feels at last that when Jesus called Peter from his boat, he spoiled an honest fisherman, and made nothing better out of the wreck than a salvation monger.|$|E
