5000|$|A grapple {{truck is}} a truck {{that has a}} grapple loader mounted to its frame which is used for loading and {{sometimes}} hauling bulky waste. A grapple loader is defined by ANSI Z245.1 as:“a hydro-mechanical device able to rotate on an axis with a grapple or bucket attached {{at the end of}} the bottom, which is intended for the collection of waste that due to size and/or weight is impractical to containerize.” [...] Grapple trucks are commonly used by municipal sanitation or public works departments, and by waste collection companies. Grapple trucks can also sometimes be used in road construction and repair. There are six types of bulky waste collection system in which grapple trucks are used: loader and body systems, <b>rear</b> <b>steer</b> system, rolloff systems, rear mounted loader and haul truck systems, rear mounted loader and trailer systems, and transfer systems.|$|E
5000|$|In {{an active}} four-wheel {{steering}} system, all four wheels {{turn at the}} same time when the driver steers. In most active four-wheel steering systems, the rear wheels are steered by a computer and actuators. The rear wheels generally cannot turn as far as the front wheels. There can be controls to switch off the <b>rear</b> <b>steer</b> and options to steer only the rear wheels independently of the front wheels. At low speed (e.g. parking) the rear wheels turn opposite to the front wheels, reducing the turning radius, sometimes critical for large trucks, tractors, vehicles with trailers and passenger cars with a large wheelbase, while at higher speeds both front and rear wheels turn alike (electronically controlled), so that the vehicle may change position with less yaw and improved build-up of the lateral acceleration, enhancing straight-line stability. The [...] "snaking effect" [...] experienced during motorway drives while towing a travel trailer is thus largely nullified.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. An {{iterative}} simulation-based nonlinear optimisation technique is used here to explore optimally controlled behaviour {{of a large}} RWD vehicle with <b>rear</b> <b>steer</b> and idealised differential actuators. A novel tyre model is also introduced, which uses simple analytic functions for separated calculation of lateral and longitudinal force, with both based on the combined slip and vertical load. By first considering suitable transient and steady-state targets for the yaw rate, optimal control is simulated which is effective throughout the lateral acceleration range. Interestingly this can be closely emulated under stable conditions using PID control of <b>rear</b> <b>steer</b> only, according to the yaw rate target and {{without the need for}} separate lateral velocity control. PID is no longer successful when stabilising control is considered, so future research will consider an extension to the nonlinear optimisation method for such cases...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study is}} to develop and {{evaluate}} an AFS and an ARS controllers to enhance lateral stability of a vehicle. A sliding mode control (SMC) and a fuzzy logic control (FLC) methods are applied to calculate the desired additional steering angle of AFS equipped vehicle or desired <b>rear</b> <b>steer</b> angle of ARS equipped vehicle. To validate AFS and ARS systems, an eight degree of freedom, nonlinear vehicle model and an ABS controllers are also used. Several road conditions are {{used to test the}} performances. The results showed that the yaw rate of the AFS and the ARS vehicle followed the reference yaw rate very well within the adhesion limit. However, the AFS improves the lateral stability near the limit compared with the ARS. Because the SMC and the FLC show similar vehicle responses, performance discrimination is small. On split- road, the AFS and the ARS vehicle had enhanced the lateral stability...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} use of {{feedback}} controller augmentation of driver inputs to achieve a desired vehicle performance. The vehicle performance is specified as a Reference Model. The driver maintains nominal control of the vehicle by direct actuation of the front steering inputs. The controller then determines the appropriate <b>rear</b> <b>steer</b> inputs necessary for tracking the reference model. As a consequence the driver is able to specify, within limits, the type of handling behavior required of the vehicle. A strategy based on yaw rate control is presented. An appropriate vehicle model is developed and a polynomial pole placement technique is used to control the vehicle. To account for vehicle model changes due to variations in forward velocity, a continuous time Recursive Least Squares approach is examined for on-line identification and adaptive control. The strategy and control designs are implemented experimentally on the Illinois Roadway Simulator (IRS), a scale vehicle testbed for vehicle dynamics and controls. Results and limitations are discussed...|$|E
500|$|Because of the {{theoretical}} benefits, especially a simplified front-wheel drive mechanism, {{attempts have been made}} to construct a rideable rear-wheel steering bike. The Bendix Company built a rear-wheel steering bicycle, and the U.S. Department of Transportation commissioned the construction of a rear-wheel steering motorcycle: both proved to be unrideable. Rainbow Trainers, Inc. in Alton, Illinois, offered US$5,000 to the first person [...] "who can successfully ride the rear-steered bicycle, <b>Rear</b> <b>Steered</b> Bicycle I". One documented example of someone successfully riding a rear-wheel steering bicycle is that of L. H. Laiterman at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, on a specially designed recumbent bike. The difficulty is that turning left, accomplished by turning the rear wheel to the right, initially moves the center of mass to the right, and vice versa. This complicates the task of compensating for leans induced by the environment. Examination of the eigenvalues for bicycles with common geometries and mass distributions shows that when moving in reverse, so as to have rear-wheel steering, they are inherently unstable. Other, purpose-built designs have been published, however, that do not suffer this problem.|$|R

Effectiveness of ESC systems in influencing rollover stability in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) dynamic rollover test is first evaluated. Since there is no generally accepted objective and repeatable procedure for evaluating and quantifying vehicle handling {{as it relates to}} safety, a process of developing such a test procedure is described. Vehicle handling tests used in the automotive industry are briefly reviewed. The criteria used for selection of maneuvers that show the best potential and can characterize these aspects of handling, which affect safety, are described. A subset of the most promising maneuvers is selected. A step steer maneuver and an open loop maneuver with steering reversal are further developed through simulations and vehicle testing. A preliminary handling metric is described, which balances the aspects of handling influencing safety. Test results for both handling tests are presented, which compare performance of vehicle with ESC and ARS systems enabled to a passive vehicle...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present an {{optimised}} 3 degrees-of-freedom non-linear dynamic {{model of a}} four-wheel-steering (4 WS) vehicle. As variables, we retain the lateral velocity V, the rolling velocity p and yaw velocity r. The front steer angle delta (f) and <b>rear</b> <b>steer</b> angle delta (r) {{are considered to be}} linear functions of the steering wheel angle theta (s) and of d theta (s) /dt, the proportionality parameters being k(1 f), k(2 f) for delta (f) and k(1 r), k(2 r) for delta (r). The parameters k(1 f), k(2 f), k(1 r), k(2 r) are optimised by use of the BOX mathematical algorithm. In a first optimisation loop we minimise the sideslip angle beta of the vehicle and in a second optimisation loop we assure, that the resultant (taken in the centre of gravity of the vehicle) of all the transversal forces F-y applied on the wheels of the vehicle (reaction forces contained in the road plane), give a component F-yx along the longitudinal axis of the vehicle, that takes a non negative value. This assures, that the motor of the vehicle will not waste fuel to overcome resistance forces originating from the steering system of the vehicle. A numerical application is also presented for a 4 WS vehicle negotiating a curve at constant velocity. The results are compared to those obtained by two models frequently used in the literature. The comparison testifies on the superiority of our model for the application presented here...|$|E
