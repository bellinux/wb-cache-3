50|$|We use <b>RxQual</b> SUB {{when we have}} DTX DL {{activated}} because <b>RxQual</b> FULL values {{will not}} be reliable, because they will use Bit error rate (BER) measurements when nothing has been sent, what leads to a very high BER and a poor <b>RxQual.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are {{two types}} of <b>RxQual</b> values, FULL and SUB.|$|E
50|$|<b>RxQual</b> {{is used in}} GSM and {{is a part of}} the Network Measurement Reports (NMR).|$|E
50|$|Each <b>RxQual</b> value {{corresponds}} {{to an estimated}} number of bit errors {{in a number of}} bursts.|$|E
50|$|The {{official}} {{definition of}} <b>RxQual</b> {{is given in}} Chapter 8.2.4 of GSM TS 05.08 (ETSI TS 100 911), later superseded by 3GPP TS 45.008.|$|E
50|$|If DTX DL is deactivated, {{is better}} to use <b>RxQual</b> FULL values, they are more precise, because it uses all frames on the SACCH multiframe, whether they have been {{transmitted}} from the base station or not.|$|E
50|$|In analog systems the {{parameters}} used as criteria for requesting a hard handover {{are usually the}} received signal power and the received signal-to-noise ratio (the latter may be estimated in an analog system by inserting additional tones, with frequencies just outside the captured voice-frequency band at the transmitter and assessing the form of these tones at the receiver). In non-CDMA 2G digital systems the criteria for requesting hard handover may be based on estimates of the received signal power, bit error rate (BER) and block error/erasure rate (BLER), received quality of speech (<b>RxQual),</b> distance between the phone and the BTS (estimated from the radio signal propagation delay) and others. In CDMA systems, 2G and 3G, the most common criterion for requesting a handover is Ec/Io ratio measured in the pilot channel (CPICH) and/or RSCP.|$|E
40|$|Drivetest {{is a way}} to get {{information}} that performed online from TEMS devices. For drivetest and logfile recording, devices have to be connected. Instead presents online data, TEMS replays logfiles for advanced observations and analysis. In this Final Project, TEMS Investigation is used outdoor and uses GPS (Global Positioning System) as navigation device and parameters plotting through drivetest route. Parameters that observed is RxLev, <b>RxQual,</b> andn SQI. Drivetest done every Saturday and Sunday during three weeks, starting on August 23 rd 2009 until September 10 th 2009 in drivetest area that divided in four sub routes. By means of datas collecting by drivetest during three weeks, call quality in GSM network can be found out, such as dropped call, blocked call, and another events occur. Those events can be observed from RxLev, <b>RxQual,</b> and SQI values that performed on screen during call. Drivetest results show that the best call quality are on average value of RxLev, <b>RxQual</b> andSQI, respectively - 79. 33 dBm, 0. 67; and 24. 78, while the worst call quality are on average value of RxLev, <b>RxQual</b> andSQI, respectively - 78. 00 dBm, 1. 78, and 17. 44. As for the best service quality provided by operator at CSSR and DCR value, respectively 94. 73...|$|E
40|$|Handover is the {{switching}} frequency when the mobile station (MS) moves into regions or cells that have channels with different frequencies with previous cell {{so that the}} on going talks will not be interrupted. In the system handovers are {{not all of the}} handover process goes well, but of course many factors that can affect keberasilan handover is, in other words every handover failures are not only determined by Rx Level is not good, but on the quality of Rx Level very both can also be a failure of handover, because the quality is not very good <b>RxQual.</b> <b>RxQual</b> does very well also could affect the successful handover system. <b>RxQual</b> is not very good quality can be caused by azimutch, M-tilt and frequency interference at the BTS. Failure handover on site id 140 367 villages lime sector 2 to the site id 140 365 Bappeda sector 1 using TEMS version 11 were taken before and after optimization stages. The percentage HOSR obtained prior to optimization of 99. 615 % with enough categories, After optimization stages HORS percentage increased up to 100 %. Failure handover on site towards the site Bapeda limestone villages because interference co-channal.

This paper exposes the cell cluster {{performance evaluation}} and optimization carried out on a commercial GSM (Global System for Mobile Communication) network operating at Onitsha and environs, Anambra State, south-East Nigeria. The performances of the network was analysed using specific key performance indicators (KPIs) such signal coverage rate, coverage reliability, TCH congestion rate, carried traffic, throughput capacity, <b>RxQual,</b> and SQI before and the optimisation exercise. The results show that after optimization process, the network coverage, capacity and quality-based KPIs were greatly improved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} propagation environment to the GSM cellular mobile network. Based on the propagation dependent environment, the mobile station suffered from the interference anytime and anywhere. This paper shows the measurement and analysis results for a special case in a live GSM network. The measurement-processing data from the field-strength driving test shows the enormous variances about 28 % of the measured RXLEV> =- 75 dBm (received signal strength) between the short call case (105 seconds for conversation and 15 seconds for idle, cycling) and the long call case (1800 seconds for conversation and 15 seconds for idle, cycling). Our investigation for the GSM network {{is based on the}} GSM metrics RXLEV, <b>RXQUAL,</b> DTX, slow frequency hopping and handover characteristics. The problems caused by measurement instruments are outside the scope of this paper...|$|E
40|$|Handover {{decisions}} in GSM networks {{are based on}} the difference in received signal strength, between the serving cell and the neighboring cells. But in a practical scenario, particularly in city area,considering difference in signal level strength alone, is an inferior criteria to decide handover issue,because the towers are in close proximity & the absolute signal strength is quite good to continue the communication,without much difficulty. Also, in these environments, multipath reflections, scattering due to moving vehicles & diffraction from multiple building edges,contributes to poor signal quality, hence forcing the mobile to transmit more power to continue the communication. Continuation of an active call {{is one of the most}} important quality measures in the cellular systems. Handover process enables a cellular system to provide such a facility by transferring an active call from one cell to another. Different approaches have been proposed and applied in order to achieve better handover service, by various researchers. The principal parameters considered in the present work, which are used to evaluate handover techniques are: Received signal quality (<b>RxQual),</b> FER, Received signal level, MS-BS distance, transmit power (TxPower) & aggregate C/I. In the present work, thorough analysis has been done for the received signal strength difference threshold, along with other RF quality parameters. To ensure best performance to all mobile users at all times and all locations an active set of parameters has been calculated for critical values along with signal strength difference threshold...|$|E
