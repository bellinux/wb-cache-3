40|$|This book {{is about}} the {{statistical}} principles behind the design of effective experiments and focuses on the practical needs of applied statisticians and experimenters engaged in design, implementation and analysis. Emphasising the logical principles of statistical design, rather than mathematical calculation, the authors demonstrate how all available information {{can be used to}} extract the clearest answers to many questions. The principles are illustrated {{with a wide range of}} examples drawn from real experiments in medicine, industry, agriculture and many experimental disciplines. Numerous exercises are given to help the reader practise techniques and to appreciate the difference that good design can make to an experimental research project. Based on Roger Mead's Design of Experiments, this new edition is thoroughly revised and updated to include modern methods relevant to applications in industry, engineering and modern biology. It also contains seven new chapters on contemporary topics, including <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation</b> and fractional replication...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{potential}} for transmission {{of infectious diseases}} offered by the school environment {{are likely to be}} an important contributor to the rates of infectious disease experienced by children. This study aimed to test whether the addition of hand sanitiser in primary school classrooms compared with usual hand hygiene would reduce illness absences in primary school children in New Zealand. Methods and Findings: This parallel-group cluster randomised trial took place in 68 primary schools, where schools were allocated using <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation</b> (1 : 1 ratio) to the intervention or control group. All children (aged 5 to 11 y) in attendance at participating schools received an in-class hand hygiene education session. Schools in the intervention group were provided with alcohol-based hand sanitiser dispensers in classrooms for the winter school terms (27 April to 25 September 2009). Control schools received only the hand hygiene education session. The primary outcome was the number of absence episodes due to any illness among 2, 443 follow-up children whose caregivers were telephoned after each absence from school. Secondary outcomes measured among follow-up children were the number of absence episodes due to specific illness (respiratory or gastrointestinal), length of illness and illness absence episodes, and number of episodes where at least one other member of the household became ill subsequently (child or adult). We also examined whether provision of sanitiser was associated with experience of a skin reaction. The number of absences for any reason and th...|$|E

40|$|Background:Newborn deaths {{account for}} 57 % of deaths in {{children}} younger than 5 years in Pakistan. Although a large programme of trained lady health workers (LHWs) exists, {{the effectiveness of this}} training on newborn outcomes has not been studied. We aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} a community-based intervention package, principally delivered through LHWs working with traditional birth attendants and community health committees, for reduction of perinatal and neonatal mortality in a rural district of Pakistan. Methods: We undertook a cluster randomised trial between February, 2006, and March, 2008, in Hala and Matiari subdistricts, Pakistan. Catchment areas of primary care facilities and all affiliated LHWs were used to define clusters, which were allocated to intervention and control groups by <b>restricted,</b> stratified <b>randomisation.</b> The intervention package delivered by LHWs through group sessions consisted of promotion of antenatal care and maternal health education, use of clean delivery kits, facility births, immediate newborn care, identification of danger signs, and promotion of careseeking, control clusters received routine care. Independent data collectors undertook quarterly household surveillance to capture data for births, deaths, and household practices related to maternal and newborn care. Data collectors were masked to cluster allocation, those analysing data were not. The primary outcome was perinatal and all-cause neonatal mortality. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, ISRCTN 16247511. Findings: 16 clusters were assigned to intervention (23 353 households, 12 391 total births) and control groups (23 768 households, 11 443 total births). LHWs in the intervention clusters were able to undertake 4428 (63 %) of 7084 planned group sessions, but were only able to visit 2943 neonates (24 %) of a total 12 028 livebirths in their catchment villages. Stillbirths were reduced in intervention clusters (39. 1 stillbirths per 1000 total births) compared with control (48. 7 per 1000, risk ratio [RR] 0. 79, 95 % CI 0. 68 - 0. 92, p= 0. 006). The neonatal mortality rate was 43. 0 deaths per 1000 livebirths in intervention clusters compared with 49. 1 per 1000 in control groups (RR 0. 85, 0. 76 - 0. 96, p= 0. 02).

40|$|Background: Therapeutic {{antibodies}} targeting EGFR have {{activity in}} advanced colorectal cancer, but results from clinical trials are inconsistent {{and the population}} in which most benefit is derived is uncertain. Our aim {{was to assess the}} addition of panitumumab to irinotecan in pretreated advanced colorectal cancer. Methods: In this open-label, randomised trial, we enrolled patients who had advanced colorectal cancer progressing after fluoropyrimidine treatment with or without oxaliplatin from 60 centres in the UK. From December, 2006 until June, 2008, molecularly unselected patients were recruited to a three-arm design including irinotecan (control), irinotecan plus ciclosporin, and irinotecan plus panitumumab (IrPan) groups. From June 10, 2008, in response to new data, the trial was amended to a prospectively stratified design, <b>restricting</b> panitumumab <b>randomisation</b> to patients with KRAS wild-type tumours; the results of the comparison between the irinotcan and IrPan groups are reported here. We used a computer-generated randomisation sequence (stratified by previous EGFR targeted therapy and then minimised by centre, WHO performance status, previous oxaliplatin, previous bevacizumab, previous dose modifications, and best previous response) to randomly allocate patients to either irinotecan or IrPan. Patients in both groups received 350 mg/m 2 intravenous irinotecan every 3 weeks (300 mg/m 2 if aged ≥ 70 years or a performance status of 2); patients in the IrPan group also received intravenous panitumumab 9 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall survival in KRAS wild-type patients who had not received previous EGFR targeted therapy, analysed by intention to treat. Tumour DNA was pyrosequenced for KRASc. 146, BRAF, NRAS, and PIK 3 CA mutations, and predefined molecular subgroups were analysed for interaction with the effect of panitumumab. This study is registered, number ISRCTN 93248876. Results: Between Dec 4, 2006, and Aug 31, 2010, 1198 patients were enrolled, of whom 460 were included in the primary population of patients with KRASc. 12 - 13, 61 wild-type tumours and no previous EGFR targeted therapy. 230 patients were randomly allocated to irinotecan and 230 to IrPan. There was no difference in overall survival between groups (HR 1 · 01, 95 % CI 0 · 83 - 1 · 23; p= 0 · 91), but individuals in the IrPan group had longer progression-free survival (0 · 78, 0 · 64 - 0 · 95; p= 0 · 015) and a greater number of responses (79 [34 %] patients vs 27 [12 %]; p< 0 · 0001) than did individuals in the irinotecan group. Grade 3 or worse diarrhoea (64 [29 %] of 219 patients vs 39 [18 %] of 218 patients), skin toxicity (41 [19 %] vs none), lethargy (45 [21]% vs 24 [11 %]), infection (42 [19 %] vs 22 [10 %]) and haematological toxicity (48 [22 %] vs 27 [12 %]) were reported more commonly in the IrPan group than in the irinotecan group. We recorded five treatment-related deaths, two in the IrPan group and three in the irinotecan group. Interpretation: Adding panitumumab to irinotecan did not improve the overall survival of patients with wild-type KRAS tumours. Further refinement of molecular selection is needed for substantial benefits to be derived from EGFR targeting agents. Funding: Cancer Research UK, Amgen Inc. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The role of backcountry huts as {{focal points}} for weed {{establishment}} and spread into New Zealand’s national parks has received little attention. In {{this study we}} describe the pattern of weed spread around Takahe Valley Hut, Murchison Mountains, Fiordland National Park. Established in 1948, the hut is located at 900 m a. s. l. at the ecotone between Nothofagus forest and valley floor shrubland/grassland. We recorded the distribution of vascular plants in quadrats (110) placed by <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation</b> around the hut, and measured relative irradiance and distance from the hut. Nine exotic species, mostly grasses, were recorded, the most frequent being Agrostis capillaris (34 %). The majority of occurrences of exotic plant species were located {{in the immediate vicinity}} (less than 5 m) of the hut but two exotic species (Agrostis capillaris and Dactylis glomerata) ranged more widely. Exotic species were present in well-drained shrubland and grassland but did not extend far into Nothofagus forest or onto infertile wetlands. The percentage of exotic species in quadrats declined significantly with distance from the hut. There was no linear relationship between the percentage of exotic species and relative irradiance. When forest quadrats were excluded, the number of native species in quadrats was negatively correlated with the number of exotic species, suggesting competitive displacement of native species by exotics in non-forest habitats. Long-term persistence of most exotic species at this site depends on physical disturbance and nutrient enrichment associated with human activities at the hut site. However the maintenance of this specie...|$|E

Stratification of sample squares was based on predefined strata (called land classes) which have been derived from a classification of all 1 km squares in Britain based on their topographic, climatic and geological attributes obtained from published maps. A series of vegetation plots were located within each 1 km square using a <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation</b> procedure designed to reduce aggregation. Linear features (road verges, watercourse banks, hedges, arable margins and field boundaries) and areal features (fields, unenclosed land and small semi-natural biotope patches) were sampled. Linear plots were 1 x 10 m laid out along a feature whilst unenclosed land and small biotopes were sampled using 2 m x 2 m plots. Larger randomly-placed plots were nested 14 m² plots with an inner nest of 2 m x 2 m. Within each 1 km Countryside Survey sample square the land cover and all landscape features were mapped and each parcel of land (and vegetation plot) has been assigned to a Broad Habitat/EUNIS habitat type. This database of vegetation plots is a very useful resource. The data is freely available from the website, however, there are restrictions on the release of the spatial location of the plots. There is now a considerable time-series of plots within the database going back to 1978 representing different habitat types and landscape features that can be analysed to determine changes in vegetation metrics (e. g.

Evidence-based {{guidelines}} {{for the management of}} people with dementia in general practice exist; however, detection, diagnosis and disclosure of dementia have been identified as potential evidence-practice gaps. Interventions to implement guidelines into practice have had varying success. The use of theory in designing implementation interventions has been limited, but is advocated because of its potential to yield more effective interventions and aid understanding of factors modifying the magnitude of intervention effects across trials. This protocol describes methods of a randomised trial that tests a theory-informed implementation intervention that, if effective, may provide benefits for patients with dementia and their carers. Aims This trial aims to estimate the effectiveness of a theory-informed intervention to increase GPs’ (in Victoria, Australia) adherence to a clinical guideline for the detection, diagnosis, and management of dementia in general practice, compared with providing GPs with a printed copy of the guideline. Primary objectives include testing if the intervention is effective in increasing the percentage of patients with suspected cognitive impairment who receive care consistent with two key guideline recommendations: receipt of a i) formal cognitive assessment, and ii) depression assessment using a validated scale (primary outcomes for the trial). Methods The design is a parallel cluster randomised trial, with clusters being general practices. We aim to recruit 60 practices per group. Practices will be randomised to the intervention and control groups using <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation.</b> Patients meeting the inclusion criteria, and GPs’ detection and diagnosis behaviours directed toward these patients, will be identified and measured via an electronic search of the medical records nine months after the start of the intervention.

40|$|Abstract Background Evidence {{generated}} from reliable research is not frequently implemented into clinical practice. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are a potential vehicle to achieve this. A recent systematic review of implementation strategies of guideline dissemination {{concluded that there}} was a lack of evidence regarding effective strategies to promote the uptake of guidelines. Recommendations from this review, and other studies, have suggested the use of interventions that are theoretically based because these may be more effective than those that are not. An evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of acute low back pain was recently developed in Australia. This provides an opportunity to develop and test a theory-based implementation intervention for a condition which is common, has a high burden, and for which there is an evidence-practice gap in the primary care setting. Aim This study aims to test the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention for implementing a clinical practice guideline for acute low back pain in general practice in Victoria, Australia. Specifically, our primary objectives are to establish if the intervention is effective in reducing the percentage of patients who are referred for a plain x-ray, and improving mean level of disability for patients three months post-consultation. Methods/Design This study protocol describes the details of a cluster randomised controlled trial. Ninety-two general practices (clusters), which include at least one consenting general practitioner, will be randomised to an intervention or control arm using <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation.</b> Patients aged 18 years or older who visit a participating practitioner for acute non-specific low back pain of less than three months duration will be eligible for inclusion. An average of twenty-five patients per general practice will be recruited, providing a total of 2, 300 patient participants. General practitioners in the control arm will receive access to the guideline using the existing dissemination strategy. Practitioners in the intervention arm will be invited to participate in facilitated face-to-face workshops that have been underpinned by behavioural theory. Investigators (not involved in the delivery of the intervention), patients, outcome assessors and the study statistician will be blinded to group allocation.

Evidence of the impact of interventions to improve health services on population-level malaria indicators is needed. We are conducting a cluster-randomised trial to assess whether a complex intervention delivered at public health centres in Uganda improves health outcomes of children and treatment of malaria, as compared to the current standard of care. 				 				 					 						Methods/Design 					Twenty public health centres (level II and III) in Tororo district will be included; 10 will be randomly assigned to the intervention and 10 to control. Clusters will include households located within 2 &# 160;km of health centres. The trial statistician will generate the random allocation sequence and assign clusters. Health centres will be stratified by level, and <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation</b> will be employed to ensure balance on cluster location and size. Allocation will not be blinded. The intervention includes training in health centre management, fever case management with use of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria, and patient-centered services, and provision of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) and RDTs when stocks run low. The impact of the intervention on population-level health indicators will be assessed through community surveys conducted at baseline in randomly selected children from each cluster, and repeated annually for two years. The impact on individuals over time will be assessed in a cohort study of children recruited from households randomly selected per cluster. The impact on health centres will be assessed using patient exit interviews, monthly surveillance, and assessment of health worker knowledge and skills. The primary outcome is the prevalence of anaemia (haemoglobin < 11. 0 &# 160;g/dL) in individual children under five measured in the annual community surveys. The primary analysis will be based on the cluster-level results. 				 				 					 						Discussion 					The PRIME trial findings will be supplemented by the PROCESS study, an evaluation of the process, context, and wider impact of the PRIME intervention which will be conducted alongside the main trial, together providing evidence of the health impact of a public sector intervention in Uganda.

Innovative interventions are urgently needed to strengthen community buy-in, {{to increase the}} coverage of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and other routine immunisations, and to enhance immunity through the introduction of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in combination with OPV. We aimed to evaluate the acceptability and effect on immunisation coverage of an integrated strategy for community engagement and {{maternal and child health}} immunisation campaigns in insecure and conflict-affected polio-endemic districts of Pakistan. Methods We did a community-based three-arm cluster randomised trial in healthy children aged 1 month to 5 years that resided within the study sites in three districts of Pakistan at high risk of polio. Clusters were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm using <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation</b> in blocks of 20 by an external statistician (1 : 1 : 1) to receive routine polio programme activities (control, arm A), additional interventions with community outreach and mobilisation using an enhanced communication package and provision of short-term preventive maternal and child health services and routine immunisation (health camps), including OPV (arm B), or all interventions of arm B with additional provision of IPV delivered at the maternal and child health camps (arm C). An independent team conducted surveys at baseline, endline, and after each round of supplementary immunisation activity for acceptability and effect.

Practitioners in the control group received a printed copy of the guideline. Practitioners in the intervention group received a theory-based intervention developed to address prospectively identified barriers to practitioner compliance with the guideline. The intervention primarily consisted of an educational symposium. Patients aged 18 years or older who visit a participating practitioner for acute non-specific LBP of less than three months duration over a two-week data collection period, three months post the intervention symposia, are eligible for inclusion. Sample size calculations are based on recruiting between 15 to 40 patients per practice. Outcome assessors will be blinded to group allocation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Evidence {{generated}} from reliable research is not frequently implemented into clinical practice. Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are a potential vehicle to achieve this. A recent systematic review of implementation strategies of guideline dissemination {{concluded that there}} was a lack of evidence regarding effective strategies to promote the uptake of guidelines. Recommendations from this review, and other studies, have suggested the use of interventions that are theoretically based because these may be more effective than those that are not. An evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of acute low back pain was recently developed in Australia. This provides an opportunity to develop and test a theory-based implementation intervention for a condition which is common, has a high burden, and for which there is an evidence-practice gap in the primary care setting. Aim: This study aims to test the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention for implementing a clinical practice guideline for acute low back pain in general practice in Victoria, Australia. Specifically, our primary objectives are to establish if the intervention is effective in reducing the percentage of patients who are referred for a plain x-ray, and improving mean level of disability for patients three months post-consultation. Methods/Design: This study protocol describes the details of a cluster randomised controlled trial. Ninety-two general practices (clusters), which include at least one consenting general practitioner, will be randomised to an intervention or control arm using <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation.</b> Patients aged 18 years or older who visit a participating practitioner for acute non-specific low back pain of less than three months duration will be eligible for inclusion. An average of twenty-five patients per general practice will be recruited, providing a total of 2, 300 patient participants. General practitioners in the control arm will receive access to the guideline using the existing dissemination strategy. Practitioners in the intervention arm will be invited to participate in facilitated face-to-face workshops that have been underpinned by behavioural theory. Investigators (not involved in the delivery of the intervention), patients, outcome assessors and the study statistician will be blinded to group allocation.

40|$|Background: Chlorhexidine {{umbilical}} cord washes reduce neonatal mortality in south Asian populations with high neonatal mortality rates and predominantly home-based deliveries. No data exist for sub-Saharan African populations with lower neonatal mortality rates or mostly facility-based deliveries. We compared {{the effect of}} chlorhexidine with dry cord care on neonatal mortality rates in Zambia. Methods: We undertook a cluster-randomised controlled trial in Southern Province, Zambia, with 90 health facility-based clusters. We enrolled women who were in their second or third trimester of pregnancy, aged at least 15 years, and who would remain in the catchment area for follow-up of 28 days post-partum. Newborn babies received clean dry cord care (control) or topical application of 10 mL of a 4 % chlorhexidine solution once per day until 3 days after cord drop (intervention), according to cluster assignment. We used stratified, <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation</b> to divide clusters into urban or two rural groups (located < 40 km or ≥ 40 km to referral facility), and randomly assigned clusters (1 : 1) to use intervention (n= 45) or control treatment (n= 45). Sites, participants, and field monitors were aware of their study assignment. The primary outcomes were all-cause neonatal mortality within 28 days post-partum and all-cause neonatal mortality within 28 days post-partum among babies who survived the first 24 h of life. Analysis was by intention to treat. Neonatal mortality rate was compared with generalised estimating equations. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials. gov (NCT 01241318). Findings: From Feb 15, 2011, to Jan 30, 2013, we screened 42   356 pregnant women and enrolled 39   679 women (mean 436 · 2 per cluster [SD 65 · 3]), who had 37   856 livebirths and 723 stillbirths; 63 · 8 % of deliveries were facility-based. Of livebirths, 18   450 (99 · 7 %) newborn babies in the chlorhexidine group and 19   308 (99 · 8 %) newborn babies in the dry cord care group were followed up to day 28 or death. 16   660 (90 · 0 %) infants in the chlorhexidine group had chlorhexidine applied within 24 h of birth. We found {{no significant difference in}} neonatal mortality rate between the chlorhexidine group (15 · 2 deaths per 1000 livebirths) and the dry cord care group (13 · 6 deaths per 1000 livebirths; risk ratio [RR] 1 · 12, 95 % CI 0 · 88 – 1 · 44). Eliminating day 0 deaths yielded similar findings (RR 1 · 12, 95 % CI 0 · 86 – 1 · 47). Interpretation: Despite substantial reductions previously reported in south Asia, chlorhexidine cord applications did not significantly reduce neonatal mortality rates in Zambia. Chlorhexidine cord applications do not seem to provide clear benefits for newborn babies in settings with predominantly facility-based deliveries and lower (< 30 deaths per 1000 livebirths) neonatal mortality rates.

40|$|Background: Pakistan faces huge {{challenges}} in eradicating polio due to widespread poliovirus transmission and security challenges. Innovative interventions are urgently needed to strengthen community buy-in, {{to increase the}} coverage of oral polio vaccine (OPV) and other routine immunisations, and to enhance immunity through the introduction of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in combination with OPV. We aimed to evaluate the acceptability and effect on immunisation coverage of an integrated strategy for community engagement and {{maternal and child health}} immunisation campaigns in insecure and conflict-affected polio-endemic districts of Pakistan. Methods: We did a community-based three-arm cluster randomised trial in healthy children aged 1 month to 5 years that resided within the study sites in three districts of Pakistan at high risk of polio. Clusters were randomly assigned by a computer algorithm using <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation</b> in blocks of 20 by an external statistician (1 : 1 : 1) to receive routine polio programme activities (control, arm A), additional interventions with community outreach and mobilisation using an enhanced communication package and provision of short-term preventive maternal and child health services and routine immunisation (health camps), including OPV (arm B), or all interventions of arm B with additional provision of IPV delivered at the maternal and child health camps (arm C). An independent team conducted surveys at baseline, endline, and after each round of supplementary immunisation activity for acceptability and effect. The primary outcome measures for the study were coverage of OPV, IPV, and routine extended programme on immunisation vaccines and changes in the proportion of unvaccinated and fully vaccinated children. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01908114. Findings: Between June 4, 2013, and May 31, 2014, 387 clusters were randomised (131 to arm A, 127 to arm B, and 129 to arm C). At baseline, 28   760 children younger than 5 years were recorded in arm A, 30   098 in arm B, and 29   126 in arm C. 359 clusters remained in the trial until the end (116 in arm A, 120 in arm B, and 123 in arm C; with 23   334 children younger than 5 years in arm A, 26   110 in arm B, and 25   745 in arm C). The estimated OPV coverage was 75 % in arm A compared with 82 % in arm B (difference vs arm A 6 · 6 %; 95 % CI 4 · 8 – 8 · 3) and 84 % in arm C (8 · 5 %, 6 · 8 – 10 · 1; overall p< 0 · 0001). The mean proportion of routine vaccine doses received by children younger than 24 months of age was 43 % in arm A, 52 % in arm B (9 %, 7 – 11) and 54 % in arm C (11 %, 9 – 13; overall p< 0 · 0001). No serious adverse events requiring hospitalisation were reported after immunisation. Interpretation: Despite the challenges associated with the polio end-game in high-risk, conflict-affected areas of Pakistan, a strategy of community mobilisation and targeted community-based health and immunisation camps during polio immunisation campaigns was successful in increasing vaccine coverage, including polio vaccine coverage.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{potential}} for transmission {{of infectious diseases}} offered by the school environment {{are likely to be}} an important contributor to the rates of infectious disease experienced by children. This study aimed to test whether the addition of hand sanitiser in primary school classrooms compared with usual hand hygiene would reduce illness absences in primary school children in New Zealand. METHODS AND FINDINGS: This parallel-group cluster randomised trial took place in 68 primary schools, where schools were allocated using <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation</b> (1 : 1 ratio) to the intervention or control group. All children (aged 5 to 11 y) in attendance at participating schools received an in-class hand hygiene education session. Schools in the intervention group were provided with alcohol-based hand sanitiser dispensers in classrooms for the winter school terms (27 April to 25 September 2009). Control schools received only the hand hygiene education session. The primary outcome was the number of absence episodes due to any illness among 2, 443 follow-up children whose caregivers were telephoned after each absence from school. Secondary outcomes measured among follow-up children were the number of absence episodes due to specific illness (respiratory or gastrointestinal), length of illness and illness absence episodes, and number of episodes where at least one other member of the household became ill subsequently (child or adult). We also examined whether provision of sanitiser was associated with experience of a skin reaction. The number of absences for any reason and the length of the absence episode were measured in all primary school children enrolled at the schools. Children, school administrative staff, and the school liaison research assistants were not blind to group allocation. Outcome assessors of follow-up children were blind to group allocation. Of the 1, 301 and 1, 142 follow-up children in the hand sanitiser and control groups, respectively, the rate of absence episodes due to illness per 100 child-days was similar (1. 21 and 1. 16, respectively, incidence rate ratio 1. 06, 95 % CI 0. 94 to 1. 18). The provision of an alcohol-based hand sanitiser dispenser in classrooms was not effective in reducing rates of absence episodes due to respiratory or gastrointestinal illness, the length of illness or illness absence episodes, or the rate of subsequent infection for other members of the household in these children. The percentage of children experiencing a skin reaction was similar (10. 4 % hand sanitiser versus 10. 3 % control, risk ratio 1. 01, 95 % CI 0. 78 to 1. 30). The rate or length of absence episodes for any reason measured for all children also did not differ between groups. Limitations of the study include that the study was conducted during an influenza pandemic, with associated public health messaging about hand hygiene, which may have increased hand hygiene among all children and thereby reduced any additional effectiveness of sanitiser provision. We did not quite achieve the planned sample size of 1, 350 follow-up children per group, although we still obtained precise estimates of the intervention effects. Also, it is possible that follow-up children were healthier than non-participating eligible children, with therefore less to gain from improved hand hygiene. However, lack of effectiveness of hand sanitiser provision on the rate of absences among all children suggests that {{this may not be the}} explanation. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of hand sanitiser in addition to usual hand hygiene in primary schools in New Zealand did not prevent disease of severity sufficient to cause school absence.

40|$|Background Although {{effective}} topical repellents provide {{personal protection}} against malaria, whether mass use of topical repellents {{in addition to}} long-lasting insecticidal nets can contribute to a further decline of malaria is not known, particularly in areas where outdoor transmission occurs. We aimed to assess the epidemiological efficacy of a highly effective topical repellent in addition to long-lasting insecticidal nets in reducing malaria prevalence in this setting. Methods A cluster randomised controlled trial {{was done in the}} 117 most endemic villages in Ratanakiri province, Cambodia, to assess the efficacy of topical repellents in addition to long-lasting insecticidal nets in controlling malaria in a low-endemic setting. We did a pre-trial assessment of village accessibility and excluded four villages because of their inaccessibility during the rainy season. Another 25 villages were grouped because of their proximity to each other, resulting in 98 study clusters (comprising either a single village or multiple neighbouring villages). Clusters were randomly assigned (1 : 1) to either a control (long-lasting insecticidal nets) or intervention (long-lasting insecticidal nets plus topical repellent) study group after a <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation.</b> All clusters received one long-lasting insecticidal net per individual, whereas those in the intervention group also received safe and effective topical repellents (picaridin KBR 3023, SC Johnson, Racine, WI, USA), along with instruction and promotion of its daily use. Cross-sectional surveys of 65 randomly selected individuals per cluster were done {{at the beginning and end}} of the malaria transmission season in 2012 and 2013. The primary outcome was Plasmodium species-specific prevalence in participants obtained by real-time PCR, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Complete safety analysis data will be published seperately; any ad-hoc adverse events are reported here. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 01663831. Findings Of the 98 clusters that villages were split into, 49 were assigned to the control group and 49 were assigned to the intervention group. Despite having a successful distribution system, the daily use of repellents was suboptimum. No post-intervention differences in PCR plasmodium prevalence were observed between study groups in 2012 (4 · 91 % in the control group vs 4 · 86 % in the intervention group; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1 · 01 [95 % CI 0 · 60 – 1 · 70]; p= 0 · 975) or in 2013 (2 · 96 % in the control group vs 3 · 85 % in the intervention group; aOR 1 · 31 [0 · 81 – 2 · 11]; p= 0 · 266). Similar results were obtained according to Plasmodium species (1 · 33 % of participants in the intervention group vs 1 · 10 % in the intervention group were infected with Plasmodium falciparum; aOR 0 · 83 [0 · 44 – 1 · 56]; p= 0 · 561; and 1 · 85 % in the control group vs 2 · 67 % in the intervention group were infected with Plasmodium vivax; aOR 1 · 51 [0 · 88 – 2 · 57]; p= 0 · 133). 41 adverse event notifications from nine villages were received, of which 33 were classified as adverse reactions (11 of these 33 were cases of repellent abuse through oral ingestion, either accidental or not). All participants with adverse reactions fully recovered and 17 were advised to permanently stop using the repellent. Interpretation Mass distribution of highly effective topical repellents in resource-sufficient conditions did not contribute to a further decline in malaria endemicity in a pre-elimination setting in the Greater Mekong subregion.

40|$|In 2009, on {{the basis}} of {{promising}} evidence from trials in south Asia, WHO and UNICEF issued a joint statement about home visits as a strategy to improve newborn survival. In the Newhints trial, we aimed to test this home-visits strategy in sub-Saharan Africa by assessing the effect on all-cause neonatal mortality rate (NMR) and essential newborn-care practices. The Newhints cluster randomised trial was undertaken in 98 zones in seven districts in the Brong Ahafo Region, Ghana. 49 zones were randomly assigned to the Newhints intervention and 49 to the control intervention by use of <b>restricted</b> <b>randomisation</b> with stratification to ensure comparability between interventions. Community-based surveillance volunteers (CBSVs) in Newhints zones were trained to identify pregnant women in their community and to make two home visits during pregnancy and three {{in the first week of}} life to promote essential newborn-care practices, weigh and assess babies for danger signs, and refer as necessary. Primary outcomes were NMR and coverage of key essential newborn-care practices. Analyses were by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00623337. 16, 168 (99 %) of 16, 329 deliveries between November, 2008, and December, 2009, were livebirths; the status at 1 month was known for 15, 619 (97 %) livebirths. 482 neonatal deaths were recorded. Coverage data were available from 6029 women in Newhints zones; of these 4358 (72 %) reported having CBSV visits during pregnancy and 3815 (63 %) reported having postnatal visits. This coverage increased substantially from June, 2009, after the introduction of new implementation strategies and reached almost 90 % for pregnancy visits by the end of the trial and 75 % for postnatal visits. The Newhints intervention significantly increased coverage of key essential newborn-care behaviours, except for four or more antenatal-care visits (5975 [76 %] of 7859 vs 5988 [74 %] of 8121, respectively; relative risk 1 · 02, 95 % CI 0 · 96 - 1 · 09; p= 0 · 52) and baby delivered in a facility (5373 [68 %] vs 5539 [68 %], respectively; 0 · 97, 0 · 81 - 1 · 14; p= 0 · 69). The largest increase was for care-seeking, with 102 (77 %) of 132 sick babies in Newhints zones taken to a hospital or clinic compared with 77 (55 %) of 139 in control zones (1 · 43, 1 · 17 - 1 · 76; p= 0 · 001). Increases were also noted in bednet use during pregnancy (5398 [69 %] of 7859 vs 5135 [63 %] of 8121, respectively; 1 · 12, 1 · 03 - 1 · 21; p= 0 · 005), money saved for delivery or emergency (5730 [86 %] of 6681 vs 5525 [80 %] of 6941, respectively; 1 · 09, 1 · 05 - 1 · 12; p < 0 · 0001), transport arranged in advance for facility (2496 [37 %] vs 2061 [30 %], respectively; 1 · 30, 1 · 12 - 1 · 49; p= 0 · 0004), birth assistant for home delivery washed hands with soap (1853 [93 %] of 1992 vs 1817 [87 %] of 2091, respectively; 1 · 05, 1 · 02 - 1 · 09; p= 0 · 001), initiation of breastfeeding in less than 1 h of birth (3743 [49 %] of 7673 vs 3280 [41 %] of 7921, respectively; 1 · 22, 1 · 07 - 1 · 40; p= 0 · 004), skin to skin contact (3355 [44 %] vs 1931 [24 %], respectively; 2 · 30, 1 · 85 - 2 · 87; p= 0 · 0002), first bath delayed for longer than 6 h (3131 [41 %] vs 2269 [29 %], respectively; 1 · 65, 1 · 27 - 2 · 13; p < 0 · 0001), exclusive breastfeeding for 26 - 32 days (1217 [86 %] of 1414 vs 1091 [80 %] of 1371; 1 · 10, 1 · 04 - 1 · 16; p= 0 · 001), and baby sleeping under bednet for 8 - 56 days (4548 [79 %] of 5756 vs 4291 [73 %] of 5846; 1 · 09, 1 · 03 - 1 · 15; p= 0 · 002). There were 230 neonatal deaths in the Newhints zones compared with 252 in the control zones. The overall NMRs per 1000 livebirths were 29 · 8 and 31 · 9, respectively (0 · 92, 0 · 75 - 1 · 12; p= 0 · 405). The reduction in NMR with Newhints is consistent with the reductions achieved in three trials undertaken in programme settings in south Asia. Because there is no suggestion of any heterogeneity (p= 0 · 850) between these trials and Newhints, the meta-analysis summary estimate of a reduction of 12 % (95 % CI 5 - 18) provides the best evidence for the likely effect of the home-visits strategy delivered within programmes in sub-Saharan Africa and in south Asia. Improvements in the quality of delivery and neonatal care in health facilities and development of innovative, effective strategies to increase coverage of home visits on the day of birth could lead to the achievement of more substantial reductions.
