40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{radiation}} tolerant CMOS standard cell library, and demonstrate its effectiveness in implementing radiation hardened digital circuits. We exploit {{the fact that if}} a gate is implemented using only PMOS (NMOS) transistors then a radiation particle strike can result only in logic a 0 to 1 (1 to 0) ip. Based on this observation, we derive our <b>radiation</b> hardened <b>gates</b> from regular static CMOS gates. In particular, we separate the PMOS and NMOS devices, and split the gate output into two signals. One of these outputs of our <b>radiation</b> tolerant <b>gate</b> is generated using PMOS transistors, and it drives other PMOS transistors (only) in its fanout. Similarly, the other output (generated from NMOS transistors) drives only other NMOS transistors in its fanout. Now, if a radiation particle strikes one of the outputs of the <b>radiation</b> tolerant <b>gate,</b> then the gates in the fanout enter a high-impedance state, and hence preserve their output values. Our <b>radiation</b> hardened <b>gates</b> exhibit an extremely high degree of SEU tolerance, which is validated at the circuit level. Using these gates, we also implement circuit level hardening based on logical masking, to selectively harden those gates in a circuit which contribute most to the soft error failure of the circuit. The gates with a low probability of logical masking are replaced by SEU tolerant gates from our new library, such that the digital design achieves a 90 % soft error rate reduction. Experimental results demonstrate that this reduction is achieved with a modest layout area and delay penalty of 62 % and 29 % respectively, for area mapped designs. In contrast with existing approaches, our approach results in SEU immunity for extremely large critical charge values (> 650 fC). I...|$|R

Only 10 patients underwent cardiac catheterization. ResultsOur initial experience showed that MSCT is capable of complementing echocardiography and replacing diagnostic cardiac catheterization for anatomical delineation if performed with an optimum technique.

40|$|We present {{theoretical}} and {{experimental studies of}} the direct current effect on the detection of subterahertz and terahertz <b>radiation</b> in <b>gated</b> two-dimensional structures. We developed a theory of the current-driven detection both for resonant case, when the fundamental frequency of plasma oscillation is large compared to inverse scattering time, omega(0) tau >> 1, and for the nonresonant case, omega(0) tau << 1, when the plasma oscillations are damped. We predict that, in the nonresonant case, even a very small dc current would increase the detection amplitude up to two orders of magnitude. Physically, this increase is related to an abrupt transition from the linear to saturation region near the knee of the current-voltage characteristic. When the current increases up to the saturation value, the electron concentration near the drain becomes very low and can be strongly affected by a small external field. As a consequence, the two-dimensional channel becomes extremely sensitive to external perturbations. In the resonant case, the detection amplitude has maxima when the radiation frequency is equal to fundamental plasma frequency and its harmonics. We predict that the effective linewidths of the respective resonances would decrease with the increasing current. Physically, this happens because dc current shifts the system towards the plasma wave instability. At some critical current value, the width corresponding to the fundamental frequency would turn to zero, indicating the onset of plasma waves generation.

While visual estimation of CCS using attenuation correction CT (CTAC) images obtained during positron emission tomography (PET) appears to agree with CAC scans, the quantification of CCS by CTAC has not been extensively studied. The aim of this analysis {{is to determine the}} correlation between coronary artery calcium score (CCS) using a low dose <b>radiation</b> non ECG <b>gated</b> CTAC and a dedicated ECG gated non contrast Cardiac CT (CAC). MethodsWe included 147 patients (mean age 62 years, 52 % male) who underwent myocardial perfusion positron emission tomography (PET) and coronary calcium score in the same setting. Calcium score was calculated twice on both non-contrast gated CT (120 Kvp, 200 mA, 2. 5 mm slice thickness), and computed tomography attenuation correction CTAC (120 Kvp, 20 mA, 3. 8 mm slice thickness) using Agatston method by two physicians blinded to the results of the other study. A threshold of 130 HU was used to define detected calcium. ResultsNearly half of the patients included in the study were obese (median BMI > 31 kg/m 2). 92 cases (63 %) had CCS> 0. There was a strong statistical correlation between calcium score obtained from the two scans at patient level (R= 0. 897, P< 0. 0001) and at vessel level (r= 0. 827, P< 0. 001). However, compared to CAC, calcium score on CTAC was overestimated in 5 cases and underestimated in 86 (59 %) patients with median difference of 88 (range 1 – 1468). Of the 92 patients with detected calcium on CAC, 39 (42 %) patients had no detected calcium on CTAC. ConclusionA very low radiation attenuation correction computed tomography scan underestimates calcium score often. A total of 42 % of patients with coronary calcifications were missed on the CT attenuation correction...|$|R
