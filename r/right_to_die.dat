The following year the Oregon <b>Right</b> <b>to</b> <b>Die</b> PAC (ORDPAC) campaigned successfully for {{the passage of}} Measure 16 in Oregon; 51% of Oregon voters approved the Death with Dignity ballot initiative which created the Oregon Death With Dignity Law (DWD) allowing those who are terminally ill to hasten death in consultation with their physician and under strict safeguards, making Oregon the first U.S. state {{and one of the}} first jurisdictions in the world to officially do so. Subsequently, the Oregon Death with Dignity Legal Defense and Education Center (ODLDEC), the forerunner to the Death with Dignity National Center, a 501(c)(3) organization, was founded to defend the voter-approved law.

Stutsman successfully defended the Death with Dignity law in the first federal court challenge spanning 1994 to 1997. See Lee v. State of Oregon,107 F.3d 1382 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 927 (1997).

On January 17, 2006, the United States Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in favor of the physician, pharmacist, and the State of Oregon. See Oregon v.

He further cited that the Supreme Court wrote in the said case, [...] " [...] may include the right of a dying man to also die with dignity when his life is ebbing out. But the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> with dignity {{at the end of life}} is not to be confused or equated with the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> an unnatural death curtailing the natural span of life." ...|$|E

Frank Schaeffer and his associate, Jim Buchfuehrer provided a private, five-hour screening of Whatever Happened to the Human Race? to Jack Kemp and wife Joanne in their home that, according to Frank Schaeffer's account of the late evening and early morning event in his book Crazy for God, led to both the Schaeffers and Koop obtaining [...] "...access to everyone in the Republican Party".

500|$|Protection of {{life and}} {{personal}} liberty is also stated under right to life and personal liberty. Article 21 declares that no citizen can be denied his life and liberty except by law. This means that a person's life and personal liberty can be disputed only if that person has committed a crime. However, {{the right to life}} does not include the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> and hence, suicide or an attempt thereof, is an offence. (Attempted suicide being interpreted as a crime has seen many debates. The Supreme Court of India gave a landmark ruling in 1994. The court repealed section 309 of the Indian penal code, under which people attempting suicide could face prosecution and prison terms of up to one year. In 1996 however another Supreme Court ruling nullified the earlier one.) [...] "Personal liberty" [...] includes all the freedoms which are not included in Article 19 (that is, the six freedoms). The right to travel abroad is also covered under [...] "personal liberty" [...] in Article 21.|$|E
500|$|Whether {{the right}} to life {{guaranteed}} by Article 9(1) encompasses a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>die</b> – that is, a right to commit suicide or a right to assisted suicide, usually {{in the face of a}} terminal illness – has not been the subject of any Singapore court case. In other jurisdictions, {{the right to}} life has generally not been interpreted in this way. In Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab (1996) the Indian Supreme Court held that {{the right to life}} is a natural right embodied in Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, and since suicide is an unnatural termination or extinction of life it is incompatible and inconsistent with the concept of the right to life. The US Supreme Court has also declined to recognize that choosing death is a right protected by the Constitution. In Washington v. Glucksberg (1997), a group of Washington residents asserted that a state law banning assisted suicide was unconstitutional on its face. The majority held that as assisted suicide is not a fundamental liberty interest, it was not protected under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Several of the justices seemed persuaded that the availability of palliative care to [...] "alleviate suffering, even to the point of causing unconsciousness and hastening death" [...] outweighed recognizing a new unenumerated [...] "right to commit suicide which itself includes a right to assistance in doing so".|$|E

Empirical evidence suggests many of the concerns governing the regulation of assisted dying in the medical context are present in the death row case. This Article therefore urges courts to use a balancing test comparable to that developed in cases involving assisted dying in the medical context. Further, counsel should be appointed to articulate the state’s interests in subjecting the conviction and sentence to appellate review...|$|R
