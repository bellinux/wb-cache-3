5|$|A {{number of}} <b>royal</b> castles, from the 12th century onwards, formed an {{essential}} network of <b>royal</b> storehouses in the 13th century {{for a wide}} range of goods including food, drink, weapons, armour and raw materials. Castles such as Southampton, Winchester, Bristol and the Tower of London were used to import, store and distribute <b>royal</b> wines. The English <b>royal</b> castles also became used as gaols – the Assize of Clarendon in 1166 insisted that <b>royal</b> sheriffs establish their own gaols and, in the coming years, county gaols were placed in all the shrieval <b>royal</b> castles. Conditions in these gaols were poor and claims of poor treatment and starvation were common; Northampton Castle appears to have seen some of the worst abuses.|$|E
5|$|Adding to the {{confusion}} is the tendency of units (again for historical reasons) to misuse titles for larger administrative structures. Although the <b>Royal</b> Artillery consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls itself the <b>Royal</b> Regiment of Artillery when referring to the units as a whole. The <b>Royal</b> Logistic Corps and Intelligence Corps are not corps-sized, but consist of several battalions or regiments.|$|E
