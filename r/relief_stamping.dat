40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a re-evaluation of the talismanic seal stones of Crete. Its {{purpose is to}} present previous scholarship on these seal stones, introduce the reader to {{a new way of}} recording and viewing seal stones through Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI), and to offer the data from a study on 384 talismanic seal stones. Seals were small stones or pieces of wood or ivory with intaglio, meaning designs were cut into their surface {{in order to create a}} <b>relief</b> when <b>stamped</b> in wet clay or a similar substance. They served several purposes: as identification, as a way of showing ownership, as a magical charm, and as portable art or jewelry. By around 2500 BCE, seal stones were in use on the island of Crete. Most of these seal stones were used for their sphragistic properties – that is, authenticating documents or otherwise securing property. The talismanic stones, categorized by Sir Arthur Evans, were rarely used in this way. Evans believed these stones were worn as magical charms or talismans. His idea has been criticized, but today we are no closer to ascertaining how this type of seal stone was used. For this study, the data on 384 talismanic seal stones was collected and organized. RTI was performed on 12 seal stones, as a new way of making digital surrogates and learning more information about the stone surface. The results of this study are presented here to clear up some of the confusion surrounding the talismanic seal stone of Crete. Advisor: Philip Sapirstei...|$|R

40|$|Pattern {{generation}} on the micro- and nano-scale {{is a vital}} {{ingredient in}} a vast variety of applications including biosensors and array devices. Current technologies are generally macroscopically-based, however a considerable increase in demand upon down-sizing must result in enabling meso/nanoscopic manipulation. Soft lithography is now routinely utilised in various applications with particular attention and importance placed on pattern transfer onto polymeric materials via the creation of masters. These are now fabricated using a number of techniques, all capable of producing well-defined surface topographies. The microelectronic industry utilises methods such as photolithography in order to fabricate such master templates at the micron scale. Various polymers {{can be used to}} transfer patterns One of the most widely used is polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The elastomer is chemically resistant, has a low surface energy and readily conforms to different surface topographies. Obtaining a master is the limiting factor in the production of PDMS replicas. The use of Diamond-Like-Carbon (DLC) as a master template is demonstrated in this study. PDMS micro/nano stamps and 3 dimensional PDMS structures have been created and routinely reproduced. Intricate surface relief patterns are formed on the DLC surface from lithographic techniques by Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) operated in the electrical conductivity mode. The mode induces oxidation on a DLC surface creating patterns in the tens of nm. An example of a lithographic pattern created on a DLC surface by this method is shown in the topographical image in Fig. 1 (a). The template shown in Fig. 1 (a) was then coated with a layer of PDMS and thus used as a master. The resultant fabricated PDMS stamp is shown in Fig. 1 (b). The <b>relief</b> of the <b>stamp</b> correlates very well with the dimensions of the DLC master. © 2006 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Tese de doutoramento em Ciências Jurídicas (ramo de conhecimento em Ciências Jurídicas Empresariais) A tese é constituída por quatro Capítulos. No I, intitulado, As Novas Tecnologias e a Privacidade, procurou efectuar-se uma análise das consequências da utilização das NTIC na relação de trabalho, começando primeiro pela sua análise e a forma como surgiram. Essa opção é essencial, como que revestindo a natureza de questão prévia para delimitar o tema objecto de análise. Pretendeu-se, ainda, analisar a noção de privacidade, assim como a sua perspectivação {{temporal}} e enquadramento jurídico, quer no Direito internacional, quer no Direito comunitário, e, ainda, sob uma perspectiva de Direito comparado, procurando aferir-se da sua origem e respectiva evolução, assim como da sua ligação estrutural às inovações tecnológicas e ao direito à autodeterminação informativa. Visou-se, ainda, sob o ponto de vista do Direito nacional, abordar, ainda que sucintamente, o tratamento deste direito em vários ramos do Direito, como o Direito constitucional, o Direito penal, o Direito civil e o Direito do trabalho, numa perspectiva jurídica claramente interdisciplinar. No Capítulo II, O Poder de Controlo Electrónico do Empregador e as Novas Tecnologias, pretendeu-se analisar o poder de controlo do empregador, começando por uma breve referência aos vários poderes de que este é detentor e à sua classificação clássica que o integra no poder directivo, o que implicou a análise deste, ainda que sucinta. Tentou-se, ainda, aferir quais as condições de exercício do poder de controlo do empregador, essencial para examinar, nos capítulos seguintes, os respectivos limites. Visou-se, ainda, estudar um novo tipo de poder de controlo do empregador que justifica a sua autonomização em relação ao poder directivo e que é o poder de controlo electrónico do empregador. Este poder está intimamente relacionado com as NTIC e aumenta, de uma forma sem precedentes, a capacidade de controlo do empregador na medida em que surge associado ao poder das máquinas, principalmente do computador, de delimitação difícil. Entendeu-se, também, ser necessária uma referência, ainda que breve, à eventual responsabilidade do empregador por actos dos seus trabalhadores sendo este um dos argumentos mais invocados para tentar legitimar o controlo do empregador das NTIC utilizadas pelos trabalhadores. No Capítulo III, O Controlo através de Meios Audiovisuais, visámos abordar a relação do poder de controlo electrónico do empregador com a utilização de meios audiovisuais, tentando, em primeiro lugar, aferir qual ou quais os vários direitos em causa, dando relevo ao direito à privacidade na sua vertente de direito à autodeterminação informativa e de tratamento de dados. Tentou-se, ainda, aferir da possibilidade de se considerar a imagem e o som como dados pessoais e tratou-se o problema do relevo do consentimento do trabalhador visado. A questão do controlo electrónico foi analisada numa dupla vertente: na decisão de adopção dos instrumentos que o suportam; e, na fase subsequente, na decisão de aplicação destes meios na relação de trabalho, com o objectivo de proceder ao estudo dos vários princípios em causa e dos problemas por eles suscitados. No último Capítulo, o IV, justamente intitulado O Controlo das Comunicações Electrónicas e o Poder Informático do Empregador, procurou examinar-se quais os limites ao poder de controlo electrónico do empregador no que concerne às comunicações electrónicas através da utilização do computador, da internet, e do e-mail dos trabalhadores, com a questão prévia da possibilidade de um direito à utilização pessoal destes meios por parte dos trabalhadores e o estabelecimento de políticas claras sobre a utilização dos meios, estabelecendo limites ao seu uso, mas não legitimando uma proibição para fins pessoais. Analisou-se, ainda, quais as eventuais formas de controlo destes meios por parte do empregador, {{considerando que}} em relação à internet os direitos que estão em causa são diferentes dos direitos no caso do e-mail, já que este é considerado um meio de comunicação. Se em relação à internet se considera que grande parte dos argumentos invocados pelos empregadores não devem ser atendidos, devendo preferir-se a prevenção à repressão, em relação ao e-mail a questão não se coloca em termos similares. Pretendeu defender-se ser preferível a divisão entre e-mails pessoais e e-mails profissionais, ficando ao empregador interdito o conhecimento do conteúdo dos primeiros face à sua protecção pelo direito ao sigilo das comunicações previsto constitucionalmente. A tese termina com Conclusões onde, em termos sintéticos, se procurou encontrar algumas propostas de solução para as diversas questões colocadas, problematizadas na Introdução e desenvolvidas nos quatro Capítulos. This thesis is constituted by four Chapters. In the I, entitled, The New Technologies and the Privacy, {{it sought to}} make {{an analysis of the}} consequences of the use of NTIC in the work relationship, beginning first for the analysis and to the form how they appeared. That option is essential, as that covering the nature of previous subject to delimit the theme analyzed. It was intended, still, to analyze the notion of privacy, as well as her temporary perspective and juridical framing, in the International Law, and in the Community Law, and, still, under a perspective of Compared Law, trying to check of her origin and respective evolution, as well as of her structural connection to the technological innovations and the right to the informative selfdetermination. It was sought, still, under {{the point of view of}} the National Law, to approach, although synthetically, the treatment of this right in several branches of the Law, as the Constitutional Law, the Criminal Law, the Civil law and the Labour Law, in a clearly interdisciplinary juridical perspective. In the Chapter II, The Power of Electronic Control of the Employer and the New Technologies, it was intended to analyze the power of control of the employer, beginning for an abbreviation reference to the several powers that this is holder and to his classic classification that it integrates it in the management power, what implicated the analysis of this, although brief. We tried, still, to check which the conditions of exercise of the power of control of the employer, essential to examine, in the following chapters, the respective limits. It was sought, still, to study a new type of power of control of the employer that justifies his study separated in relation to the management power and that is the power of electronic control of the employer. This power is intimately related with NTIC and it increases, in an unprecedented way, the capacity of control of the employer in the measure in that associate appears to the power of the machines, mainly of the computer, of difficult delimitation. We understood, also, to be necessary a reference, although brief, to the eventual responsibility of the employer for their workers' acts being this one of the arguments more invoked to try to legitimate the control of the employer of NTIC used by the workers. In the Chapter III, The Control through Audiovisual Means, we try to approach the relationship of the power of electronic control of the employer with the use of audiovisual means, trying, in first place, to check which of several rights were in cause, giving relief to the right to privacy in its right slope to the informative selfdetermination and of treatment of data. We tried, still, to check of the possibility to consider the image and the sound as personal data and the problem of the <b>relief</b> of the <b>stamped</b> worker's consent was treated. The subject of the electronic control was analyzed in a couple slope: in the decision of adoption of the instruments that support it; and, in the subsequent phase, in the decision of application of these means in the work relationship, with the aim of proceeding to the study of the several principles in cause and of the problems for them raised. In the last Chapter, the IV, exactly entitled The Control of the Electronic Communications and the Computing Power of the Employer, we tried to examine which the limits to the power of electronic control of the employer in what concerns to the electronic communications through the use of the computer, of the internet, and of the workers' e-mail, with the previous question of the possibility of a right to the personal use of these means on the part of the workers and the establishment of clear politics about the use of the means, establishing limits to its use, but not legitimating a prohibition for personal ends. It was analyzed, still, which the eventual forms of control of these means on the part of the employer, considering that in relation to the internet the rights that are in cause are different from the rights in the case of the e-mail, since this is considered a middle of communication. If in relation to the internet it is considered that great part of the arguments invoked by the employers should not be assisted, should be preferred the prevention to the repression, in relation to the e-mail the subject is not put in similar terms. We intended to defend to be preferable the division between personal e-mails and professional e-mails, being to the employer injunction the knowledge of the content of the first in relation to its protection for the right to the secrecy of the communications foreseen constitutionally. This thesis finishes with Conclusions where, in synthetic terms, we tried to find some proposed of solution for the several questions analyzed, problematized in the Introduction and developed in the four Chapters...|$|R
