A certificate of completion was issued on 27 August specifying a sum of money that was to be retained by the employer government against defective work and for maintenance for a period of one year.

50|$|The {{court held}} further that the {{certificate}} of completion signified the coming into existence of a right to claim payment of the <b>retention</b> <b>money</b> subject to a suspensive condition, namely the repair of any defects which might manifest themselves during the retention period. It has been accepted in commerce and by the courts of South Africa {{for more than a}} century that future rights could be ceded and transferred in anticipando. Accordingly, the cession of 31 December 1984, was a valid one. If it incorporated a transfer in anticipando of the right in question (which only came into being at a later stage), it would have been legally effective.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the ground}} that {{withholding}} the thing sold was regarded already in the Corpus Juris as analogous to the holding of a pledge, {{one would expect that}} the exceptio would only apply as a defence until performance was actually made. The right of withholding (the converse of the exceptio) is therefore essentially a means of enforcing the counter-performance. It can fulfil a function similar to <b>retention</b> <b>moneys</b> in a building contract. On the other hand, it follows that, as long as performance remains possible and the contract is not cancelled, the other party can still perform. Indeed, this possibility should be related to the doctrine of mora and purgatio morae.|$|R
5000|$|The {{words of}} the deed, in {{particular}} the words [...] "transfer and make over," [...] and the reference to moneys and amounts becoming due and owing in future, indicated a present mutual intention of now transferring rights as they came into existence in the future.
