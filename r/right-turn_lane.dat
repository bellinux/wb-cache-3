The research showed that the capacity of a signalized intersection approach with a short <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane</b> is strongly related to the length of the <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane,</b> the proportion of through or right-turn vehicles, and cycle length.

This research evaluates the effect of these weaving maneuvers on the operations of a free <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane</b> at the ramp terminals.

40|$|Guidelines {{for the use}} of right-turn lanes at {{access points}} on urban two-lane and four-lane {{sections}} of the state highway system in Nebraska were developed in this research. The guidelines are {{based on the results of}} a benefit-cost analysis conducted over the range of conditions representative of those on urban sections of the state highway system in Nebraska. The guidelines define the design hour traffic volumes for which the benefits of right-turn lanes exceed their costs. The benefits used in the analysis were operational and accident cost savings they provide to road users. The operational cost savings were those associated with reductions in stops, delay, and fuel consumption experienced by through traffic. These operational effects were determined by computer simulation. The accident cost savings were those associated with the reduction in accidents expected from the lower speed differences between right-turning and through traffic provided by right-turn lanes. The relationship between speed differential and accidents established by Solomon (14) was used to estimate the reduction in rearend accidents that would be expected to result from the provision of a <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane.</b> The <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane</b> costs used in the development of the guidelines were typical <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane</b> construction costs on urban sections of the state highway system in Nebraska. These costs were computed as a function of roadway speed and right-of-way cost. The right-of-way costs used included zero for construction within the existing right-of-way and values representative of low, medium, and high urban right-of-way costs in Nebraska. ^ The guidelines define the right-turn design hour volume required to justify a <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane</b> as a function of the following factors: (1) directional design hour volume, (2) roadway speed, (3) number of lanes on the roadway, and (4) right-of-way cost. The guidelines indicate that the right-turn design hour volume that warrants a <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane</b> is lower on roadways with higher directional design hour volumes and higher roadway speeds, because the road user costs associated with the operational and safety effects of right turns are greater on higher-volume, higher-speed roadways. Likewise, the right-turn design hour volume required to justify a <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane</b> on a two-lane roadway is lower than that on a four-lane roadway. Comparison with guidelines developed by others indicates that the guidelines developed in this research are within the range of existing guidelines. In addition, they are more definitive than the other guidelines because they account for the effects of roadway speed and right-of-way costs. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the safety of cyclists in five bicycle {{facility}} layouts in signalized intersections at various traffic volumes in order to assess if some layouts are better than others with regards to cyclist safety and to develop methods to facilitate this comparison. The five layouts included two full-length bicycle tracks with and without separate <b>right-turning</b> <b>lane,</b> two truncated bicycle tracks – one in which cyclists and right-turning vehicles merge in the <b>right-turning</b> <b>lane,</b> one continued into a narrow bicycle lane – and a recessed bicycle track. Using two different definitions of traffic conflicts the safety of cyclists in each layout is calculated as the risk of a cyclist being involved in a conflict with left- and right-turning vehicles at low, medium and high vehicle volumes, respectively. In total, around 35, 500 left-turning vehicles, 38, 000 right-turning vehicles and 16, 000 cyclists going straight ahead were observed, resulting in 12 left-hook and 25 right-hook traffic conflicts for the reaction-based indicator and 25 left-hook and 80 right-hook traffic conflicts for the time-based indicator. The results show that regardless of which of the two conflict indicators were used, the number of conflicts was too small to make firm conclusions about which layout is safest for cyclists at various traffic volumes, although the study was based on 80 h of video recordings from each of the five intersections. However, a recessed bicycle track seems to be safer than the other geometric layouts. In order to facilitate the detection of conflicts, we developed watchdog video analysis software to reduce the amount of video. This software compressed 400 h of video into 64 h, i. e. 16 % of its original length.

40|$|Analysis of {{the right}} turn lane length of urban roads in {{left-hand}} traffic countries, such as Australia, UK and India (left-turn lane length in right-hand traffic countries such as USA), at signalised intersections encounters two main geometric features namely, deceleration length and storage length. The literature shows that in routine practice, the deceleration length is generally estimated by using constant deceleration rate. Many researchers consider this assumption for all design speeds unrealistic as it {{does not reflect the}} influence of the pavement condition. Hence, it may be desirable to consider the pavement’s condition in terms of its longitudinal coefficient of friction in the design analysis. In regard to the storage length, a large number of the current guidelines and models estimate the storage length of <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane</b> at signalised intersections under split phase. Hence, {{there is a need to}} examine other phase types and timings and integrate the signal timing as a part of the geometric design In this thesis, two analytical expressions have been analysed for the design of deceleration length. The first expression assumes a constant deceleration rate, and the second expression employs the concept of forces on a rotating wheel in which the coefficient of longitudinal friction between a vehicle’s tyres and the road surface is considered. The calculated deceleration lengths by these two expressions were compared with the recommended values in American and Australian standards as well as with the deceleration lengths that were obtained by a recent simulation study presented in the literature. It has been found that applying a constant deceleration rate of 2. 74 m/s 2 in the first expression provides the values of deceleration length comparable to most guidelines and studies. The second expression highlights the importance of using the pavement design in terms of the coefficient of friction to reduce the deceleration length in the case of limited space. A MATLAB based simulation programme has been developed to provide an estimate of the <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane</b> storage length for different traffic volumes in order to avoid the problems associated with blocking and overflow of right turn vehicles in 95 % of cycles. In established intersections that cannot be modified due to physical constraints, the model is flexible enough to examine different signal phase types and timings and provides other solutions to reduce overflow and/or blockage situations. The simulation model also takes into consideration the leftover queue. The model results have been compared against an available analytical method in which similar signal phases and timings were investigated. The outcomes are similar to those of the analytical model in most of the signal phase types. The simulation model provides the flexibility to estimate the <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane</b> length for different combinations of through lane and <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane</b> traffic volumes. The developed simulation model has also been validated against the field data using three parameters, namely 95 th percentile of maximum queue, overflow cycle percentage, and blockage cycle percentage. Comparing with the field observations yields a level of accuracy in the range of 78 %- 85 %. Finally this simulation model has been used to optimise the green time in the case of split phase that demonstrates a large difference in traffic volumes of two opposite approaches; this could reduce the mean wait time by up to 28 %...|$|E
40|$|RTOR) is {{a traffic}} control {{strategy}} at signalized intersections that allows vehicles to turn right during red phases provided {{they do not}} impede the vehicles and pedestrians in green phases. RTOR is primarily a delay and energy conservation measure,’ Several studies that examined the impact of RTOR on vehicular delays have shown the potential of reducing fuel consumption by about 5 percent on urban streets. 2 ’ 3 The reduction of delay and fuel consumption is related to extra capacity because RTOR allows vehicles to pass through an intersection in red phases. The extra capacity can be significant if an exclusive <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane</b> is provided. If an exclusive <b>right-turn</b> <b>lane</b> is not provided, a straight-through vehicle arriving during a red phase will block all the following right-turning vehicles; thus, the extra capacity can be relatively small in a through-right shared lane. Chapter 9 of the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM) provides a powerful technique for evaluating how well an intersection will operate. ” This technique, however, is less successful in dealing with intersections where RTOR movement is permitted because it requires the analyst to supply RTOR volumes. When applying this method to existing intersections, the analyst should have no difficulty in counting RTOR volumes in the field. When applying this method to proposed plans, however, the analyst has no way to estimate RTOR volumes. The Highway Capacity Software (HCS), which {{was developed by the}} Federal Highway Administration as a faithful implementation of the HCM method, provides the analyst with a credible guideline. ’ This guideline, however, is limited because RTOR volumes cannot be greater than right-turning volumes. In fact, not only is RTOR volume less than right-turning volume, it is also less than the RTOR capacity, which cannot be determined through the HCM guideline. This situation has led to a need for a formula to compute RTOR capacity. This paper proposes a method to calculate this capacity. Before addressing capacit y computation, however, it is necessary to investigate the factors that affect RTOR capacity...|$|E

The rebuilt intersection would {{take the form of a}} roundabout, replacing several intersecting roadways that connect the north and south sections of Front Street with US41/M-28 through the existing intersection. The previous intersection configuration dated back to the 1960s. It had been labeled as [...] "dangerous and [...] significant traffic delays" [...] by the designers of the replacement. A traffic study concluded in 2007 that the intersection would need either the roundabout or a traffic signal with several turning lanes to accommodate the traffic needs in the area. MDOT decided in favor of a two-lane, [...] roundabout retaining the <b>right-turn</b> <b>lanes</b> from the previous intersection layout. These lanes will be used by right-turning traffic to bypass the circle at the center of the intersection.|$|R
40|$|In British Columbia (BC), over 20, 000 {{injuries}} and 400 fatalities occurred each year at intersections between 2000 and 2004. Using Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis, {{the objective of}} this study is to identify which of the 12 intersection characteristics play a role in predicting intersection safety. Using data from 19 intersections from Surrey, Richmond and Vancouver from the years 2000 to 2004, the findings reveal that traffic volume, restricted left-turns, permissive left-turns and <b>right-turn</b> <b>lanes</b> are positive predictors of intersection casualties. Five policy alternatives are proposed: 1) status quo, 2) reducing traffic volume, 3) eliminating the use of restricted left-turns, 4) using protected over permissive left-turns and 5) prohibiting right-turn on red. The policies are evaluated using three criteria 1) cost; 2) reduced casualty and 3) time delay. Based on the evaluation, status quo emerges as the most effective recommendation for reducing intersection casualties and improving intersection safety...|$|R
