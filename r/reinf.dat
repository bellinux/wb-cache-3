40|$|Myanmar was visitedduring April 5 and 11, 2002, {{and land}} use was {{surveyed}} around Yezin of the central Myanmar and in the Ayeyarwady delta of the lower Myanmar. Agriculture in Myanmar is, in general, practiced under the <b>reinfed</b> condition. In this visiting time, Myanmar was in the hot and dry season, and 80 to 90 % of the cultivated land was observed to be in no cropping. The remaining 10 to 20 % wad irrigated and planted with summer rice. Shifting cultivation was surveyed at Sinthot village near Yezin, under Pyinmana township, Mandalay Division. Main crops planted in this village are rice, banana,corn chilly turmeric ginger,sesame, and beans. After slushu and burn of weeds and bushes, these crops are planted in April in the start of thr rainy season and harvested in October, except for banana. No planting is performed in the second year. Banana is harvested after 5 to 6 years, with the a fallow duration of 4 to 5 years, and shifting cultiavtion will be started again. The field after harvesting of the first-year crops was observed. Paddy-rice cultivation was surveyed at Shwe Kya village near Yezin, under Pyinmana township, Mandalay Division. Irrigation water from the Yezin dam is available in this village, and rice is cropped two times in a year. The first crop (monsoon rice) is transplanted in June to July and harvested in thefirst week of November with a growing period of 130 to 135 days. The second crop (summer rice) is directly seeded in February with a drum seeder and is harvested in May. The paddy field where summer rice is growing is observed. The variety was IR 50, and the growing condition was good. Psddy-rice cultivation in the Ayeyarwady delta was surveyed at Myanma Billion Company under Nyaungdon township, Ayeyarwady Division. This area {{is located in the}} depressed region, and rice is cropped ince in the dry season in a year. Water level is too deep to cultivate rice in the rainy season. Summer rice is transplanted in Decenmer an harvested in April with the growing period of 120 days. The yield of the summer rice is 3. 6 Mg/ha. The fertilizer does is 63 kg/ha for N and 31 kg/ha for P 205. Potassium fertilizer is not applied. In addition to the survey of land use, Yezin Agricultutal University which is only a four-year course agricultural unievrsutu in Myanmar was visited.

40|$|A {{new concept}} of a neutron {{absorption}} material (i. e., an artificial rare earth compound) was introduced for criticality control in a spent fuel storage system. In particular, spent nuclear fuels were considered as a potential source of rare earth elements because the nuclear fission of uranium produces {{a full range of}} nuclides. It was also found that an artificial rare earth compound (<b>RE?inf?</b> 2 ?/inf?O?inf? 3 ?/inf?) as a High-Level Waste (HLW) was naturally extracted from pyroprocessing technology developed for recovering uranium and transuranic elements (TRU) from spent fuels. In this study, various characteristics (e. g., activity, neutron absorption cross-section) were analyzed for validating the application possibility of this waste compound as a neutron absorption material. As a result, the artificial rare earth compound had a higher neutron absorption probability in the entire energy range, and it can be used for maintaining sub-criticality for more than 40 years {{on the basis of the}} neutron absorption capability of Boral™. Therefore, this approach is expected to vastly improve the efficiency of radioactive waste management by simultaneously keeping HLW and spent nuclear fuel in a restricted space.

40|$|Plant fibres have {{a unique}} set of {{properties}} ranging from being stiff and brittle, such as hemp and flax, to more ductile, such as coir, c ombining these properties with their cost and availability makes them attractive alternative reinforcements for the production of greener composites. This article reviews the tensile properties of various plant fibre or plant based natural fibre - reinforced polymer s reported in the literature. We critically discuss the use of plant fibres as reinforcement for the production of bio - based, renewable or green polymer composites, showing t he evolution of the properties of plant fibre composites. The reported tensile properties of plant fibre - reinforced polymer composites are compared against various renewable and n on - renewable engineering/commodity polymers as well as the tensile properties of commercially available randomly oriented glass fibre - reinforced polymers (GFRP). G reen composites containing random short plant fibres do have similar properties to randomly oriented GFRP at a lower overall part weight. U nidirectional plant fibre - <b>reinf</b> orced polymers offer better performance than randomly oriented GFRP and could have the potential to be adapted in applications requiring even higher mechanical performance, especially in areas where the use of costly synthetic fibres might be less attracti ve. Furthermore, plant fibres can also be regarded as effective fillers to replace more expensive polymer s and improve the green credential s of final composite parts. These features may motivate the industry to introduce more plant fibre - based products to the market...|$|E
40|$|Trabajo presentado en el 4 th International Workshop on the Biology of Fish Gametes, celebrado en Albufeira (Portugal) del 17 al 20 de septiembre de 2013. It {{is known}} that {{cryopreservation}} promotes cellular damage that could compromise sperm quality. In sperm, seminal plasma provides the major defense against oxidative stress. However, dilution in the extender before cryopreservation reduces the co ncentration of antioxidants in seminal plasma, diminishing sperm protection against reactive oxyge n species (ROS). In previous studies of our group it was demonstrated {{that this type of}} damage could be in part counteracted by the addition of antioxidants into the extenders. Extenders suppleme nted with vitamins C or E, improved sperm motility of cryopreserved sperm (Martínez-Páramo et al., 2012), and taurine and hypotaurine, besides improving motility, reduced DNA fragmentati on (Martínez-Páramo et al., 2013). However, the antioxidant supplemented extenders did not redu ce lipid peroxidation or improved sperm viability. Taking into account that broodstock diet {{plays an important role in}} gametogenesis and gamete quality (Izquierdo et al., 2001), in this wo rk, a nutritional approach to enhance the sperm antioxidant defense was attempted. Therefore, three experimental diets were tested in European seabass and gilthead seabream with the aim of <b>reinf</b> orcing the sperm antioxidant system before and after cryopreservation. The supplements chosen were vitamins, selenium and zinc, because of their antioxidant capacity and important role in sp ermatogenesis.

30|$|As was {{explained}} in the previous sections, SOLID 46 with anisotropic material properties {{has been used to}} model FRP laminates (Parvin and Granata 2000; Kachlakev et al. 2001; Mahini 2005). Tension-only membrane SELL 41 and elastic SHELL 99 have also been used for this purpose (Mirmiran et al. 2000; Hawileh et al. 2012). One possibility to better model FRP in ANSYS which is not tried previously by researchers (although used for modeling reinforcing bars in concrete, (Hunley and Harik 2012)) is to use its reinforced shells and solids elements. These elements constitute a base element that can be reinforced with additional elements. In the case of FRP, the saturant can be used as the base element while fibers are added as reinforcing elements. Figure  6 shows the saturant and the fibers as different element. Reinforcing elements can be defined as discrete or smeared, and they can act as tension-only, compression only or tension and compression elements. In fact, for FRP, the tension-only fibers are used. Element SHELL 181 can be used as the base element for FRP composite material. Then, it can be reinforced using <b>REINF</b> 265 smeared element. Each layer of reinforcement behaves as a unidirectional material. All layers including the base element perform like a parallel system. Perfect bond is assumed amongst the layers. Each layer can have its own thickness (defined as fiber area and space), orientation and local axis coordinate system. This option seems to be most appropriate for modeling FRP sheets in ANSYS. Fibers are embedded inside the base saturant and can have different directions without affecting each other. Even though the fibers are modeled as tension-only elements, the saturant which represents the base element can be modeled as an elastic element with isotropic properties.|$|E
40|$|The unique mechanical, thermal, and {{electrical}} properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) make them an ideal reinforcement for the metal matrix composites (MMCs). The successful incorporation of CNTs as reinforcement in MMCs {{can result in}} the development of lightweight and high-strength structures which can eventually result in weight savings for the automobile and aerospace industries. In the last two decades extensive research has been carried out to improve the dispersion of CNTs in metal and polymer matrices. Challenges remain to effectively disperse CNTs within the matrix materials with minimal damage during the composite processing stages. The ultra-high Young&# 039;s modulus and other superior mechanical and thermal properties of CNTs have been attributed to the strong sp 2 carbon-carbon (C-C) bonds present in their structures. In order to fully utilize the unique properties of CNTs as reinforcement, damages to CNTs in the form of damaging these sp 2 C-C bonds have to be minimized. A variety of processing techniques have been developed to fabricate CNTs reinforced MMCs but mechanical alloying (MA) via powder metallurgy (PM) is most widely used process to develop the nano-composites. The role of processing variables during PM and their effects on the structural integrity of CNTs have been reviewed in this work. Governing principles to predict the mechanical properties of CNTs with incorporating the key process variables are deduced. With the help of these governing equations, critical study of the processes parameters and their effects on the structural integrity of CNTs, it is possible to optimize the processing methodologies of CNTs reinforced MMCs and get the maximum benefit from the unique properties of CNTs. It is assumed that better dispersion of CNTs in the metal matrices, retaining the structural integrity of CNTs and optimization of process parameters would result in better mechanical and tribological properties of CNTs <b>reinf...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of fiber orientation {{is of great}} interest for efforts to predict the microstructure and material properties of a suspension flow system. In this research a fiber-level, hybrid simulation method, LBM‒EBF (coupled lattice‒Boltzmann method with the external boundary force method) is undertaken to advance the current understanding of the hydrodynamic interaction induced rotational diffusion mechanism for rigid fibers in semidilute suspension of low Reynolds number flow. The LBM‒EBF simulations correctly predict the orbit constant distribution of fibers in a sheared semidilute suspension flow. It is demonstrated that an anisotropic, weak rotary diffusion model can fit the orbit constant distribution very well, {{but it can not}} describe the asymmetry in Stokes flow observed in semidilute suspension. The rotational diffusion process is then characterized with a three dimensional spatial tensor representation of the rotational diffusivity. A scalar measure of the rotational diffusion‒'scalar Folgar‒Tucker constant', C[subscript I], is extracted from this tensor. The study provides substantial numerical evidence that the range of C[subscript I] (0. 0038 to 0. 0165) obtained by Folgar&Tucker (J. <b>reinf.</b> plast. and comp, v. 3, 1984) in a semidilute regime is overly diffusive, and that the correct magnitude is of O(10 ⁻⁴). The study reveals that the interactions among fibers become more frequent with either the decrease of fiber aspect-ratio, r[subscript p] (keeping nL³ constant, where n is the fiber number density, and L is the fiber length) or with the increase of nL³ (keeping r[subscript p] constant) in the semidilute regime, which in consequence causes an increase in C[subscript I]. The rheological properties of sheared semidilute suspension are also computed with direct LBM‒EBF simulations. The LBM‒EBF investigation is extended to characterize the fiber orientation in a linearly contracting channel similar to a paper machine 'headbox'. It is found that the rotational diffusion is the predominant term over the strain rate in the semidilute regime for a low Reynolds number flow, and it results in a decreasing trend of rotational Peclet number, Pe, along the contraction centerline. Lastly, in order to improve the numerical consistency of the existing LBM‒EBF approach, a modification to the body force term in the LB equation is suggested, which can recover the exact macroscopic hydrodynamics from the mesoscale.
