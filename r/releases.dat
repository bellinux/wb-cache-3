5000|$|The {{most common}} form of non-rolling <b>release</b> (or {{standard}} <b>release)</b> software is fixed <b>release</b> software, where (unlike a [...] rolling <b>release)</b> the <b>release</b> is [...] and occurs at a fixed point in time. A minor software <b>release</b> in-between software versions is called a point <b>release.</b> Some software projects adopt a date-based (also termed a timed or scheduled <b>release)</b> <b>release</b> policy, where software is <b>released</b> on a specific predetermined date, versus others which use a state-based (or <b>release</b> when ready) <b>release</b> policy, where software is <b>released</b> once deemed by the development team to be in a release-ready state.|$|R

They can apply to any piece or collection of software; for example application software might adopt either a rolling <b>release</b> or fixed <b>release</b> software development model.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to develop bilayered tablets of lornoxicam to achieve biphasic <b>release</b> pattern. A bilayered tablet, consisting of an immediate and controlled <b>release</b> layer, was prepared by direct compression technique. The controlled <b>release</b> effect was achieved by using various hydrophilic natural, semi synthetic and synthetic controlled <b>release</b> polymers such as xanthan gum, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) to modulate the <b>release</b> of the drug. The in vitro drug <b>release</b> profiles showed the biphasic <b>release</b> behavior in which the immediate <b>release</b> (IR) layer containing the lornoxicam was <b>released</b> within 15 minutes, whereas the controlled <b>release</b> (CR) layer controlled the drug <b>release</b> for up to 24 h. All the bilayered tablets formulated have followed the zero order <b>release</b> with non-Fickian diffusion controlled <b>release</b> mechanism after the initial burst <b>release.</b> FTIR studies revealed {{that there was no}} interaction between the drug and polymers used in the study. Statistical analysis (ANOVA) showed {{no significant difference in the}} cumulative amount of drug <b>release</b> after 15 min, but significant difference (p < 0. 05) in the amount of drug <b>released</b> after 24 h from optimized formulations was observed. Based on the <b>release</b> kinetic parameters obtained, it can be concluded that xanthan gum polymer was suitable for providing a biphasic <b>release</b> of lornoxicam...|$|R
