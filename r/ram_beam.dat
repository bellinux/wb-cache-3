40|$|Erosion {{rates of}} organic {{materials}} are measured {{during a recent}} flight of the shuttle (STS- 8). Several forms of carbon {{and a variety of}} thermosetting and thermoplastic polymers are exposed to the <b>ram</b> <b>beam</b> of atomic oxygen. Arrhenius energies of about 1000 to 2000 cal/mole were measured from the rate dependencies on temperature. If some simple assumptions are made about the chemical nature of the desorbed species, the data can be used to estimate production rates at surfaces in orbit under different conditions of temperature, oxygen atom flux, and material surface conditions...|$|E

In {{order to}} inspect on wall {{condition}} inside the coke oven, an inspection device {{has been developed}} to protect a camera inside and sustains high temperature long enough {{so that it can}} be permanently-installed on the pusher <b>ram</b> <b>beam.</b> The temperature of the coking chamber during operation is about 1200 C while the maximum tolerable temperature of a camera is less than 40 C. The device has to function as a good thermal insulator with cooling element for the camera at the pusher head and for signal cables along the beam. In this paper, the necessary conditions of the inspective device were found out by building a three-dimensional numerical model of the device to simulate the temperature distribution inside the device with CFD commercial software...|$|E

Total weight was 1,100 lbs.|$|R
40|$|Our results {{demonstrate}} that photorefractive residual amplitude modulation (RAM) noise in electro-optic modulators (EOMs) {{can be reduced}} by modifying the incident beam intensity distribution. Here we report {{an order of magnitude}} reduction in <b>RAM</b> when <b>beams</b> with uniform intensity (flat-top) profiles, generated with an LCOS-SLM, are used instead of the usual fundamental Gaussian mode (TEM 00). RAM arises from the photorefractive amplified scatter noise off the defects and impurities within the crystal. A reduction in RAM is observed with increasing intensity uniformity (flatness), which is attributed to a reduction in space charge field on the beam axis. The level of RAM reduction that can be achieved is physically limited by clipping at EOM apertures, with the observed results agreeing well with a simple model. These results are particularly important in applications where the reduction of residual amplitude modulation to 10 ^- 6 is essential...|$|R
30|$|Other {{potential}} emerging {{classes of}} memory technologies, we are describing in short, are molecular tunnel memory (MTM), polymeric ferroelectric <b>RAM</b> (PFRAM), spin-polarized <b>beam</b> magnetic memory (SPBMM), light memory, and complex metal-oxide RRAM (CMORRAM). We {{can say that}} these are sister memory technologies of molecular memory, ferroelectric/polymer memory, magnetic memory, and metal-oxide RRAM, respectively. Although these new technologies will almost certainly result in more complex memory hierarchies than their family memories, {{they are likely to}} allow the construction of memory chips that are nonvolatile, have low energy, and have density and development close to or better than those of DRAM chips, with improved performance and allowing memory systems to continue to scale up.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{adhesion}} capacity of unmodified mud grouts used to repair structural cracks on medium and large scale <b>rammed</b> earth specimens. <b>Beam</b> and wallet-specimens were manufactured using a soil from Alentejo (Portugal), whose {{particle size distribution}} had to be first corrected due to its high clay content. An “artificial” (composed by kaolin and limestone powder) and a “natural” (composed by sieved soil and limestone powder) mud grout were used to repair the specimens, which were previously tested under three-point bending and diagonal-compression and then retested. The grout injection shown to provide satisfactory results regarding the adhesion capacity, but {{only if it is}} performed with the “natural” mud grout.
