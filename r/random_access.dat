5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} {{are usually}} {{designed to work}} in either the pointer machine or <b>random</b> <b>access</b> machine models of computing. The main {{difference between these two}} models is in how memory may be addressed. The <b>random</b> <b>access</b> machine allows any value that is stored in a register to be used as the address of memory read and write operations, with unit cost per operation. This ability allows certain complex operations on data to be implemented quickly using table lookups. In contrast, in the pointer machine model, read and write operations use addresses stored in pointers, and it is not allowed to perform arithmetic operations on these pointers. In both models, data values may be added, and bitwise Boolean operations and binary shift operations may typically also be performed on them, in unit time per operation. Different integer sorting algorithms make different assumptions, however, about whether integer multiplication is also allowed as a unit-time operation. Other more specialized models of computation such as the parallel <b>random</b> <b>access</b> machine have also been considered.|$|E

In this paper, we introduce a new approach called SaveRF (Save <b>random</b> <b>accesses</b> in Relevance Feedback) for iterative relevance feedback search. SaveRF predicts the potential candidates for the next iteration and maintains this small set for efficient sequential scan. By doing so, repeated candidate accesses can be saved, hence {{reducing the number of}} <b>random</b> <b>accesses.</b> In addition, efficient scan on the overlap before the search starts also tightens the search space with smaller pruning radius.

40|$|We {{consider}} a scenario {{where we want}} to query a large dataset that is stored in external memory and does not fit into main memory. The most constrained resources in such a situation are the size of the main memory and the number of <b>random</b> <b>accesses</b> to external memory. We note that sequentially streaming data from external memory through main memory is much less prohibitive. We propose an abstract model of this scenario in which we restrict the size of the main memory and the number of <b>random</b> <b>accesses</b> to external memory, but admit arbitrary sequential access. A distinguishing feature of our model is that it allows the usage of unlimited external memory for storing intermediate results, such as several hard disks that can be accessed in parallel. In this model, we prove lower bounds for the problem of sorting a sequence of strings (or numbers), the problem of deciding whether two given sets of strings are equal, and two closely related decision problems. Intuitively, our results say that there is no algorithm for the problems that uses internal memory space bounded by N 1 −ε and at most o(log N) <b>random</b> <b>accesses</b> to external memory, but unlimited “streaming access”, both for writing to and reading from external memory.

40|$|Permutation is a {{fundamental}} operator for array data, with applications in, for example, changing matrix layouts and reorganizing data cubes. We consider the problem of permuting large quantities of data stored on secondary storage supporting fast <b>random</b> block <b>accesses,</b> such as solid state drives and distributed key-value stores. Faster <b>random</b> <b>accesses</b> open up interesting new opportunities for permutation. While external merge sort has often been used for permutation, it is an overkill that fails to exploit the property of permutation fully and carries unnecessary overhead in storing and comparing keys. We propose faster algorithms with lower memory requirements for a large, useful class of permutations. We also tackle practical challenges that traditional permutation algorithms have not dealt with, such as exploiting <b>random</b> block <b>accesses</b> more aggressively, considering the cost asymmetry between reads and writes, and handling arbitrary data dimension sizes (as opposed to perfect powers often assumed by previous work). As a result, our algorithms are faster and more broadly applicable. ...|$|R
40|$|Top-k query {{processing}} is {{an important}} building block for ranked retrieval, with applications ranging from text and data integration to distributed aggregation of network logs and sensor data. Top-k queries operate on index lists for a query’s elementary conditions and aggregate scores for result candidates. One of the best implementation methods in this setting is the family of threshold algorithms, which aim to terminate the index scans {{as early as possible}} based on lower and upper bounds for the final scores of result candidates. This procedure performs sequential disk accesses for sorted index scans, but also has the option of performing <b>random</b> <b>accesses</b> to resolve score uncertainty. This entails scheduling for the two kinds of accesses: 1) the prioritization of different index lists in the sequential accesses, and 2) the decision on when to perform <b>random</b> <b>accesses</b> and for which candidates. The prior literature has studied some of these scheduling issues, but only for each of the two access types in isolation. The current paper takes an integrated view of the scheduling issues and develops novel strategies that outperform prior proposals by a large margin. Our main contributions are new, principled, scheduling methods based on a Knapsackrelated optimization for sequential accesses and a cost model for <b>random</b> <b>accesses.</b> The methods can be further boosted by harnessing probabilistic estimators for scores, selectivities, and index list correlations. In performance experiments with three different datasets (TREC Terabyte, HTTP server logs, and IMDB), our methods achieved significant performance gains compared to the best previously known methods...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{volume of}} time-based generated {{data and the}} shift in storage technologies suggest that {{we might need to}} reconsider indexing. Several workloads- like social and service monitoring- often include attributes with implicit clustering because of their time-dependent nature. In addition, solid state disks (SSD) (using flash or other low-level technologies) emerge as viable competitors of hard disk drives (HDD). Capacity and access times of storage devices create a trade-off between SSD and HDD. Slow <b>random</b> <b>accesses</b> in HDD have been replaced by efficient <b>random</b> <b>accesses</b> in SSD, but their available capacity is one or more orders of mag-nitude more expensive than the one of HDD. Indexing, however, is designed assuming HDD as secondary storage, thus minimizing <b>random</b> <b>accesses</b> at the expense of capacity. Indexing data using SSD as secondary storage requires treating capacity as a scarce re-source. To this end, we introduce approximate tree indexing, which em-ploys probabilistic data structures (Bloom filters) to trade accuracy for size and produce smaller, yet powerful, tree indexes, which we name Bloom filter trees (BF-Trees). BF-Trees exploit pre-existing data ordering or partitioning to offer competitive search perfor-mance. We demonstrate, both by an analytical study and by ex-perimental results, that by using workload knowledge and reduc-ing indexing accuracy up to some extent, we can save substantially on capacity when indexing on ordered or partitioned attributes. In particular, in experiments with a synthetic workload, approximate indexing offers 2. 22 x- 48 x smaller index footprint with competitive response times, and in experiments with TPCH and a monitoring real-life dataset from an energy company, it offers 1. 6 x- 4 x smaller index footprint with competitive search times as well. 1...|$|R

5|$|COBOL {{supports}} three file formats, or : sequential, indexed and relative. In sequential files, {{records are}} contiguous {{and must be}} traversed sequentially, similarly to a linked list.
