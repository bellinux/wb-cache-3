There will often be a solid colour spot {{at the base of}} the tail and a white tip. The tail should be set moderately low, following the slope of the back. It should hang in a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a <b>reasonable</b> <b>level</b> of brush.|$|E
5|$|Day 3 outlooks {{refer to}} the day after tomorrow, and include the same {{products}} (categorical outline, text description, and probability graph) as the Day 2 outlook. As of June 2012, the SPC forecasts general thunderstorm risk areas. Higher probability forecasts are less and less likely as the forecast period increases due to lessening forecast ability farther in advance. Day 3 moderate risks are quite rare; these have been issued only fourteen times since the product became operational (most recently for May 9, 2015). Day 3 high risks are never issued and the operational standards do not allow for such. This is most likely because it would require both a very high degree of certainty (60%) for an event which was still at least 48 hours away and a <b>reasonable</b> <b>level</b> of confidence that said severe thunderstorm outbreak would include significant severe weather (EF2+ tornadoes, hurricane-force winds, and/or egg-sized hail).|$|E

That November, Melody Maker reported that Love {{and the group}} wanted to look beyond surf rock and avoid {{living in the past}} or resting on the band's laurels. When Wilson resigned from touring in order to focus on songwriting and producing, the rest of the band assumed that he would continue making music that their audiences expected of them. [...] Although The Beach Boys Today! and Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!) (both released in 1965) were more sophisticated and elaborate than previous albums, they were still within the realm of acceptability for the band, producing a <b>reasonable</b> <b>level</b> of record sales and chart activity. This was not the case for the next two album projects recorded over 1966 and 1967, where Wilson's bandmates were not entirely supportive of his new creative ambitions. Wilson was also encumbered by pressure from Capitol Records and the group's fanbase. While the band's contemporaries grew more intellectually aware, Capitol continued to bill the Beach Boys as [...] "America’s Top Surfin' Group!", expecting Wilson to write more surfing material for the yearly summer markets, despite his growing disinterest.|$|E
500|$|Wrinch {{replied to}} the steric-clash, free-energy, {{chemical}} and residue-number {{criticisms of the}} cyclol model. [...] On steric clashes, she noted that small deformations of the bond angles and bond lengths would allow these steric clashes to be relieved, or at least reduced to a <b>reasonable</b> <b>level.</b> [...] She noted that distances between non-bonded groups within a single molecule can be shorter than expected from their van der Waals radii, e.g., the 2.93 Å distance between methyl groups in hexamethylbenzene. [...] Regarding the free-energy penalty for the cyclol reaction, Wrinch disagreed with Pauling's calculations and stated that too little was known of intramolecular energies {{to rule out the}} cyclol model on that basis alone. [...] In reply to the chemical criticisms, Wrinch suggested that the model compounds and simple bimolecular reactions studied need not pertain to the cyclol model, and that steric hindrance may have prevented the surface hydroxyl groups from reacting. [...] On the residue-number criticism, Wrinch extended her model to allow for other numbers of residues. [...] In particular, she produced a [...] "minimal" [...] closed cyclol of only 48 residues, and, on that (incorrect) basis, may have been the first to suggest that the insulin monomer had a molecular weight of roughly 6000 Da.|$|E
500|$|A third {{programme}} {{of expansion}} was initially mooted in 2008. The {{aim of this}} programme was to expand the stadium into an all-embracing [...] "sports village", replete with an ice rink, indoor golf course, restaurants and shops. Gateshead Council invited tenders in August 2008 from commercial organisations interested in undertaking the development. A formal draft development brief was compiled and published in November 2009. A report to Council in December 2009 noted {{that there had been}} [...] "a <b>reasonable</b> <b>level</b> of interest at the preliminary stage" [...] from private investors, but that only one detailed proposal had been submitted, which had been declined by the Council on financial grounds. The report also noted concerns that the original centrepiece of the proposed village, the ice rink, may have been deterring investors and that a similar proposal to redevelop land at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland was detracting from what councillors had hoped to be a unique feature of the proposed village. The result was that a fresh proposal was raised to remove the ice rink from the brief in an attempt to [...] "stimulate the market". A public consultation was undertaken and in May 2010 the council reported that 327 of the 375 responses received were in favour of the amended proposal. As a result, notice was given to developers that the council intended to market the site and ten responses were received.|$|E

With the amount of cheap manatee jokes kept to a <b>reasonable</b> <b>level,</b> this episode also manages to find an excellent balance between comedy and storytelling. It's a fantastic way to celebrate the Family Guy one-hundredth episode milestone.

500|$|Although {{they never}} {{finished}} below third place from 1952 through 1960, the [...] "Go-Go White Sox" [...] were a team which thrived on speed, defense and pitching rather than hitting, and Pierce struggled for offensive support throughout {{his time with}} the club. Both Richards and Lopez – who became Chicago's manager in 1957 – placed a low emphasis on offense, with Lopez expressing his philosophy that [...] "all a team really needed was pitching and defense, because if you didn't allow the other team to score, eventually they would give you a run, and you'd win the game." [...] Nellie Fox, who was also Pierce's roommate, turned to him on one occasion when the White Sox picked up a run following a scoring drought and said, [...] "Here's your run. Now {{go out there and}} hold it." [...] Although AL teams averaged 4.46 runs per game from 1949 through 1961, and the White Sox averaged 4.53 runs in games started by their other pitchers, they averaged only 4.20 runs in Pierce's starts – a figure which drops to 4.07 if the two-month scoring outburst in 1956 is discounted; in over two thirds of his losses with Chicago (105 of 152), and fully one third of his starts (130 of 390), they scored two or fewer runs. They averaged 3.7 runs in his 1953 starts, and 3.6 runs in his 1955 starts; even in 1959, when the pennant-winning White Sox averaged 4.29 runs per game, they averaged only 3.36 runs in Pierce's starts. By 1955 it was regularly noted that Chicago's offensive struggles were placing undue pressure on the pitching staff, wearing them out with [...] "one tense game after another, never having a comfortable margin that might permit a little breather now and then"; Pierce was described as [...] "the unluckiest pitcher in the majors" [...] that year {{due to the lack of}} scoring. But in contrast, when he had a <b>reasonable</b> <b>level</b> of offensive backing he was far more successful, posting a record of 30–11 when Chicago scored four runs and 99–10 when they scored five or more; from September 1951 through May 1958, he was 71–6 when they scored at least four runs and 55–1 when they scored at least five.|$|E
