50|$|Centropomus Lacépède, 1802, is a genus of {{predominantly}} marine fish {{in family}} Centropomidae of order Perciformes. The type species is Centropomus undecimalis, the common snook. Commonly known as snooks or <b>róbalos,</b> the Centropomus species are native to tropical and subtropical {{waters of the}} western Atlantic and eastern Pacific Oceans.|$|E
50|$|Centropomus parallelus is {{a species}} of fish in the family Centropomidae, the snooks and <b>robalos.</b> It is known by several common names, {{including}} fat snook, smallscale fat snook, little snook, and chucumite. It is native to the western Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, its distribution extending from southern Florida in the United States to southern Brazil near Florianópolis.|$|E
50|$|Centropomidae is {{a family}} of {{freshwater}} and marine fishes in the Perciformes. The sole genus in the family is Centropomus, known commonly as the snooks or <b>robalos.</b> Prior to 2004, three other genera were placed in Centropomidae in subfamily Latinae, which has since been raised to the family level and renamed Latidae because a cladistic analysis showed the old Centropomidae to be paraphyletic, leaving Centropomus as the only remaining genus in this family. These are popular game and food fishes.|$|E

50|$|Kimmel took <b>Robalo</b> to the South China Sea {{to operate}} against tanker traffic trying {{to supply the}} Japanese fleet at Tawi Tawi. During one attack against a target, <b>Robalo</b> was {{attacked}} by a Japanese plane. Bombs from the plane severely damaged the submarine's periscopes, damaged her conning tower, and wrecked her radar. When diving to escape the aircraft, the main induction flooded and the boat plunged towards the bottom until Kimmel stopped her descent at 350 feet. Despite the damage, Kimmel insisted the <b>Robalo</b> remain on patrol.|$|R

5000|$|For {{her second}} patrol, Robalo {{went to the}} South China Sea, {{assigned}} to interdict Japanese tanker traffic from French Indochina to the fleet anchorage at Tawi Tawi. On 24 April 1944 off Indochina [...] she was bombed by a Japanese antisubmarine aircraft, suffering shattered and flooded periscopes and loss of radar, while taking a harrowing plunge to 350 ft after her main induction was improperly closed (a casualty frighteningly reminiscent of Squalus) in diving to escape. {The [...] "Robalo" [...] had been seen by Japanese aircraft carrier Kaiyō while escorting convoy Hi-58; {{which resulted in the}} [...] "Robalo" [...] being damaged 24 April 1944 one of the ships which escaped damage from the [...] "Robalo" [...] was the Mayasan Maru.} On a [...] "wildly aggressive patrol" [...] lasting 51 days, Robalo fired twenty torpedoes in four attacks. In regard to the four claims by the Robalo: on May 3, 1944 6 torpedoes against a 4000-ton freighter {no damage}; May 8, 1944 4 torpedoes against a 1900-ton submarine {no damage}; May 17, 1944 6 torpedoes against a 7500 tanker {1 hit} and 4 torpedoes against a 1500-ton destroyer {no damage}.

40|$|Os <b>robalos</b> Centropomus são peixes que possuem alto valor {{comercial}} e grande importância econômica e social. Possuem potencial para aqüicultura, pois se adaptam ao confinamento e arraçoamento. O conhecimento dos requerimentos nutricionais dos <b>robalos</b> é básico para a elaboração de rações específicas. Para determinar a digestibilidade de alguns ingredientes utilizados em rações para peixes, trabalhou-se Centropomus parallelus, utilizando-se o farelo de soja, farelo de aveia e farelo de arroz, testados como ingredientes de rações que continham 0, 5 % de óxido crômico (Cr 2 O 3) como marcador externo. A metodologia experimental foi composta de quatro tanques cilíndrico-cônicos, com volume de 60 L e 10 peixes cada, conectados a dois filtros biológicos interligados com volume útil de 100 L. O fundo dos tanques foi usado para coleta dos excrementos e as amostras foram armazenadas e, após, secas em estufa a 55, 0 ºC para análises. Os valores de digestibilidade aparente da matéria seca, proteína bruta e energia bruta das rações foram, respectivamente: farelo de soja, 78, 74 %, 90, 96 %, 82, 66 %; farelo de aveia, 48, 06 %, 81, 10 %, 60, 25 %; farelo de arroz, 59, 34 %, 86, 98 %, 69, 06 % e da matéria seca digestível, proteína digestível e energia digestível dos alimentos: farelo de soja, 65, 38 %, 36, 04 %, 3497 kcal/kg; aveia, 21, 36 %, 9, 15 %, 4197 kcal/kg; farelo de arroz, 46, 41 %, 6, 57 %, 3434 kcal. The snooks Centropomus parallelus are fishes {{with high}} commercial value {{and social and}} economic importance. They have potencial {{to be used in}} aquaculture, as they accept to be confined and to be fed with ration. The knowledge of the nutritional requeriments of the snook is basic to produce especific ration. Centropomus parallelus fed soybean meal, oat meal and rice meal, tested as ration ingredients with 0. 5 % to chromium oxide (Cr 2 O 3), as a external marker, were used to determine the digestibility of some ingredients used in fish ration. The experimental methodology was composed by four cylinder-conical tanks, with 60 L of volume each, with ten fishes, connected to two interchanged biological filter with 100 L of volume. The bottom of the tanks was used for the excrement collection, and the samples collected were frozen and, after, dried in stove at 55. 0 ºC for analyses. The apparent digestibility values of dry matter, crude protein and gross energy in the ration were: soybean meal, 78. 74, 90. 96, and 82. 66 %; oat, 48. 06, 81. 10 %, and 60. 25 %; rice meal, 59. 34, 86. 98, and 69. 06 %; dry matter digestibility, crude protein digestibility and gross energy digestibility of ingredients were: soybean meal, 65. 38 %, 36. 04 %, 3497 kcal/kg; oat, 21. 36 %, 9. 15 %, and 4197 kcal/kg; rice meal, 46. 41 %, 6. 57 %, and 3434 kcal/kg...|$|E

5000|$|... ‘Róbalo’ or snook are world-renowned {{game fish}} of the Centropomidae family - genus Centropomus {{that are much}} sought after by fly fishing enthusiasts and sportfishing charters. Six Atlantic and six Pacific Ocean species are {{currently}} recognized as scientifically valid. All are known to inhabit Central America and all are excellent gamefish. There is no evidence found of the individual species crossing from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean or vice versa through the Panama Canal. All <b>Robalo</b> or snook species are capable of inhabiting both fresh and saltwater and are known to seasonally occupy Gatun Lake, which forms a water bridge connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans {{as an integral part}} of the Panama Canal. Of the twelve species only 4 are known to reach sizes in excess of 10 lbs. - two Atlantic Ocean species (Centropomus undecimalis and Centropomus poeyi) and two Pacific Ocean species (Centropomus viridis and Centropomus nigrescens). The eight species of smaller <b>Robalo</b> usually grow to less than 6 lbs. and can be readily distinguished by from the four larger species by their noticeably longer anal spine, anal fin configuration and body shape. The four large species are immediately recognizable by their more streamlined appearance given by the longer narrower body shape. Many individual species of <b>Robalo</b> bear a close resemblance to one another although they may be from the same or different oceans so identification is best left up to experts. The two Atlantic Ocean large <b>Robalo</b> species (Centropomus undecimalis and Centropomus poeyi) are virtually identical in appearance. They can usually only be distinguished by the number of gill rakers each possesses. The <b>Robalo</b> or common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) commonly has eleven to thirteen non-rudimentary gill rakers and the Mexican snook (Centropomus Poeyi) is most often found to possess fifteen to eighteen non-rudimentary gill rakers. The Pacific Ocean “Robalo Ñato” or white snook (Centropomus viridis) is also a dead ringer for the common snook (Centropomus undecimalis). The distinguishing feature is also the non-rudimentary gill raker count with thirteen to fifteen for the white snook (Centropomus Viridis). They act, breed, grow and fight virtually the same. Curiously, laboratory reared specimens of the common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) showed meristic variations in vertebrae, fin ray and gill raker numbers not observed in specimens from the wild. These variations are suspected to be due to diet and growth rates. Large <b>Robalo</b> caught in Lake Gatun invariably cause a wealth of confusion. The IGFA requires verification of the species by a designated authority for world record claims. The two Pacific Ocean species of large <b>Robalo</b> (Centropomus viridis and Centropomus nigrescens) are somewhat easier to distinguish.|$|R
