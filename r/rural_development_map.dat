40|$|In {{this study}} a {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> Plans (RDPs) in four intermediate rural regions (Northern Netherlands, Lower Saxony, Wales and Emilia Romagna) and four most urban regions (Southern Netherlands, North Rhine-Westphalia, Flanders and Lombardia) is made. Such plans are designed in {{the scope of the}} second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). In particular, the focus was on the question whether the menu approach of the second pillar enables EU member states and regions to design <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> Plans with a tailor-made set of measures which address their specific <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> needs. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} the current menu of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> measures is sufficient to suit the wide range of socio-economic, ecological and physical circumstances in the EU regions. The analysis also revealed that there is some overlap between the three <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> priorities of the second pillar. Therefore, an outline of future <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> priorities and measures in the EU is designed, in which it is attempted to avoid overlap between the various <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> priorities and in which each measure contributes to the achievement of one development priority only. In addition, it is proposed that regions would select only those measures in their <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> Plan which really address the <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> needs in their region, even if this results in a <b>Rural</b> <b>Development</b> Plan with only one or two <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> measures. Such an approach of selecting <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> measures according to regional needs will result in a large variation in <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> measures implemented and may be considered regional differentiation of EU <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> polic...|$|R
40|$|With the {{socio-economic}} transformation, {{regional development}} factors recombination and followed industrial restructuring {{have changed the}} rural areas in eastern coastal China deeply. The interaction between the material and non-material elements affecting rural production and lifestyles shaped different <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> types depending on a carrier, which is composed of different industries. Accordingly, this paper makes the definitions of four <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> types, i. e., farming industry dominated <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type (FIT), industry dominated <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type (IDT), <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type focusing on business, tourism and services industries (BTT), and balanced <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type (BDT), and classifies the <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> types in eastern coastal China. Then, taking the social representation approach and basing on the major factors affecting the long-term <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> and the exertion of {{the functions of the}} countryside with regard to society, the assessment indicator system of rurality degree index (RDI) was established to distinguish the rurality degree of different types. The results indicated that. to some extent, the RDI may accurately reflect the status quo of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> and the exertion of the functions of the countryside with regard to society, and can also reflect the different stage in what the same <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> type in different region stays. The authors argue that the study on the interaction of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> factors in the process of economic and social transformation and the subsequent <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> model is very important to deeply understand the <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> and to smoothly achieve coordinated and balanced rural-urban development in developing countries, which are experiencing rapid industrialization and urbanization.
