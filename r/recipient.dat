We hypothesized that chimpanzees would use visual gestures toward attentive <b>recipients</b> and auditory/tactile gestures toward inattentive <b>recipients.</b> We also hypothesized that gesture sequences would be more prevalent toward unresponsive rather than responsive <b>recipients.</b> The chimpanzees used significantly more auditory/tactile rather than visual gestures first in sequences with both attentive and inattentive <b>recipients.</b> They rarely used visual gestures toward inattentive <b>recipients.</b> Auditory/tactile gestures were effective with and used with both attentive and inattentive <b>recipients.</b> <b>Recipients</b> responded significantly more to single gestures than to first gestures in sequences. Sequences often indicated that <b>recipients</b> {{did not respond to}} initial gestures, whereas effective single gestures made more gestures unnecessary.

40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) -reverse {{seroconversion}} (RS) following allogeneic hematopoietic {{stem cell}} transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a frequent late-onset complication in <b>recipients</b> with previous HBV infection. We followed 38 allo-HSCT <b>recipients</b> with previous HBV infection, and conducted posttransplant HB vaccine intervention in 13 <b>recipients.</b> First, we followed the <b>recipients</b> without any intervention (historic control) until 2003; hence, we commenced HB vaccination. Out of the patients who underwent transplantation after 2003, 13 <b>recipients</b> were immunized by a standard three-dose regimen after immunosuppressant cessation (vaccine group), whereas 12 <b>recipients</b> were observed without any intervention (nonvaccine group). Eight of the 13 historic control group <b>recipients</b> and 3 of the 12 nonvaccine group <b>recipients,</b> {{but none of the}} 13 vaccine group <b>recipients,</b> suffered HBV-RS. Cumulative risks of HBV-RS at 3 years post-HSCT in the historic control, nonvaccine and vaccine groups were 41 %, 39 %, and 0 % respectively (P =. 022).

5|$|Matching, also {{referred}} to as “cost sharing”, is a requirement for the <b>recipient</b> to provide contributions or donations (usually non-federal) of a specified amount or percentage to supplement federal assistance received. In other words, when the <b>recipient</b> participates in a federal program (e.g. it receives federal assistance) and an operating budget is prepared, the federal government may require the <b>recipient</b> to provide contributions to cover a portion of that program’s operations. The matching requirement is based on the assertion that total program expenses are 100% and that, although the federal government provides assistance for most of those expenses, the <b>recipient</b> must still cover a portion of them. Such proportion is solely decided by the federal government, but usually the <b>recipient</b> decides how that contribution is provided and to which expenses, so long as the contribution is verifiable, generally does not originate from another federal program, and is considered in the operating budget. The expenses must be necessary and reasonable, allowed under cost principles (see B section above), and not used for another federal program. Matching may be in the form of contributing the recipient’s own funds or money to suffrage program allowable costs (e.g., paying program utility bills, paying part of program personnel payroll, etc.) or, in some cases, in the form of in-kind contributions, which are donations of non-monetary objects such as services, materials, property, etc.|$|E
