40|$|In recent years, both in Russia {{and most}} {{economically}} developed countries {{there is a}} growth of illegitimate births. The {{birth of a child}} prior <b>to</b> <b>marriage</b> is usually considered as a risk factor for his health. In Murmansk maternity hospitals, there was an assessment of main health indices of 3 newborns groups: born in <b>registered</b> <b>marriage</b> (114 children), in civil marriage (106 children) and born to unwed mothers (103 children). By questioning mothers, the authors have revealed certain medical and social risk factors for their health. It was established that the health of children born in civil marriage is not worse and according to some indices it is even better than the health of children born in <b>registered</b> <b>marriage.</b> According <b>to</b> most parameters, the health of children born to unwed mothers was certainly worse than the health of the newly born children born <b>to</b> mothers in <b>registered</b> <b>marriage.</b> The differences in indices were due to a larger number of medical and social risk factors, negatively affecting the health of the children born to unwed mothers. Misbegotten children cannot be considered as one group of a social risk. We should only refer children born to unwed mothers to the high risk group, while according to the level of health risk children born in civil marriage are comparable with children born <b>to</b> mothers in <b>registered</b> <b>marriage.</b> Key words: misbegotten children, health of newborns, risk factors. </strong...|$|R

5|$|Despite {{his fame}} and popularity, like many former {{servicemen}} contending with post-war economic hardship, Smith struggled financially – a predicament compounded by illness.

50|$|Internal {{passports}} {{were used}} in the Soviet Union for identification of persons for various purposes. In particular, passports were used to control and monitor the place of residence by means of the propiska, a regulation designed to control the population's internal movement by binding a person to his or her permanent place of residence. For example, a valid propiska was necessary to receive higher education or medical treatment, although these services were not limited to the location <b>registered.</b> Besides <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> a resident of another area, university education was the most popular way of circumventing one's propiska and residing elsewhere. Also, since only a minority of dwellings were privately owned, having a propiska at a certain address meant that one had the right to live there.|$|R

Since the texts do not provide the laws, its explanation is also not found in conventional fiqh.

30|$|Moreover, the {{academic}} literature depicts Chinese transnational marriages as a strongly gendered phenomenon. According to Beijing Statistical Yearbook, {{by the middle}} of 2011, there were nearly 0.6 million foreigners living in Beijing long-term. In 2012, more than 25, 000 foreign students came to Beijing for bachelor and postgraduate studies. According to Huang’s (2010) study on the foreign population in Beijing, in 2007, the male to female sex ratio of foreigners working in Beijing is 392 : 57. This statistic may explain why international dating in Beijing seems to be becoming more a practice for Chinese women than for Chinese men (Wang X: Gender, dating, and violence in Urban China, forthcoming). Based on Beijing marriage registration data for the period from 2004 to 2011, Gao and her colleagues (2013) found that there were 7011 transnational <b>marriages</b> <b>registered</b> in Beijing, amounting to around 0.7  % of total marriage registrations. Gao et al. (2013) also found that 63.5  % of the overseas partners were from greater China (Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan), the USA, Canada, Japan, and Australia. Official marriage records analysed by Jeffreys and Pan (2013 : 357) show that women constituted a large majority of the Chinese citizens who <b>registered</b> a <b>marriage</b> <b>to</b> a foreigner, even though their share declined from 97  % in 1979 to 77.3  % in 2010.|$|R

5000|$|In medieval Europe, {{marriage}} was governed by canon law, which recognised as valid only those marriages where the parties stated they took {{one another as}} husband and wife, regardless of {{the presence or absence}} of witnesses. It was not necessary, however, to be married by any official or cleric. This institution was cancelled in England with the enactment of [...] "Lord Hardwicke's Marriage Act" [...] of 1753, which required that, in order to be valid and <b>registered,</b> all <b>marriages</b> were <b>to</b> be performed in an official ceremony in a religious setting recognised by the state, i.e. Church of England, the Quakers, or in a Jewish ceremony. Any other form of {{marriage was}} abolished. Children born into unions which were not valid under the Act would not automatically inherit the property or titles of their parents. For historical reasons, the Act did not apply in Scotland. Consequently, until 1940, it continued to be enough in Scotland for a man and a woman to pledge their commitment to each other in front of witnesses <b>to</b> legalise their <b>marriage.</b> This led <b>to</b> an industry of [...] "fast marriages" [...] in Scottish towns on the border with England; the town of Gretna Green was particularly well known for this.
