40|$|The {{problem of}} {{transferring}} a rocket vehicle from a given circular orbit {{to a larger}} coplanar circular orbit in minimum time, using a constant low-thrust rocket engine, is considered. Parameters are chosen to correspond to a transfer from the earth's orbit in heliocentric space to the orbit of Mars. A path satisfying the first order necessary conditions of variational calculus is shown to be locally minimizing by application {{of a set of}} second order conditions. A physical explanation is offered to justify the <b>retrothrust</b> period occurring during the flight. A neighboring optimum feedback control law, based on estimated time-to-go, is applied to this problem. State variable and terminal constraint feedback gains are calculated while one of the second order conditions, involving the backward integration of a matrix Riccati equation, is being tested...|$|E
40|$|The thermal {{protection}} required for decelerating and maneuvering spacecraft by aerodynamic forces is determined for return missions from geosynchronous to low Earth orbits. The effect of vehicle configuration on surface heating rates and selection of heat shield materials is analyzed. The {{effects of the}} current widespread estimates {{in the structure of}} atmospheric density are also evaluated. It is shown that nonequilibrium radiation can be a major source of surface heating during atmospheric entry and a significant factor for heat shielding requirements. It is also demonstrated that drag-brake concepts have application to a broad range of orbital transfer missions because of the favorable tradeoffs with aeromaneuvering vehicles in volumetric efficiency, <b>retrothrust</b> plane-change capability, and heat protection requirements. In addition, {{the results of this study}} indicate that the aeroassist technique produces acceptable penalties in vehicle payload capacity for drag-brake concepts, because of the system's heat protection requirements, and is highly attractive relative to all-propulsive orbital change maneuvers...|$|E
40|$|An {{analytical}} {{study was}} made to assess {{the ability of a}} plot, simulated by permissible error performance, to control the entire lunar approach and descent with relatively simple guidance schemes. The control task consisted of applying <b>retrothrust</b> during the hyperbolic approach to establish a lunar orbit. During this lunar coasting orbit, the lunar module was separated from the command and service module. A second deorbit thrust period was used on the lunar module to establish a coasting descent, and a final thrust period was used to put the vehicle into a reasonable landing situation. Throughout the maneuver the pilot was permitted to make reasonable errors, selected in a random manner, in the thrust time and attitude control. The control schemes consisted of maintaining a constant vehicle attitude with respect to the line of sight to the lunar horizon for the first and second thrust periods, and a constant angle with respect to the line of sight to the orbiting command and service module for the third thrust period.

40|$|The Greater Caucasus (GC) fold-and-thrust belt {{lies on the}} {{southern}} deformed edge of the Scythian Platform (SP) and results from the Cenoozoic structural inversion of a deep marine Mesozoic basin {{in response to the}} northward displacement of the Transcaucasus (lying south of the GC subsequent to the Arabia-Eurasia collision. A review of existing and newly acquired data has allowed a reconstruction of the GC history through the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. In Permo(?) -Triassic times, rifting developed along at least {{the northern part of the}} belt. Structural inversion of the basin occurred during the Late Triassic corresponding to the Eo-Cimmerian orogeny, documented SE of the GC and probably linked to the accretion of what are now Iranian terranes along the continental margin. Renewed development of extensional basin formation in the area of the present-day GC began in Sinemurian-Pliensbachian times with rift activity encompassing the Mid-Jurassic. Rifting led to extreme thinning of the underlying continental crust by the Aalenian and concomitant extrusion of mid-ocean ridge basalt lavas. A Bathonian unconformity is observed on both sides of the basin and may either correspond to the end of active rifting and the onset of post-rift basin development or be the record of collision further south along the former Mesozoic active margin. The post-rift phase began with deposition of Late Jurassic platform-type sediments onto the margins and a flysch-like unit in its deeper part, which has transgressed the basin during the Cretaceous and Early Cenozoic. An initial phase of shortening occurred in the Late Eocene under a NE-SW compressional stress regime. A second shortening event that began in the Mid-Miocene (Sarmatian), accompanied by significant uplift of the belt, continues at present. It is related to the final collision of Arabia with Eurasia and led to the development of the present-day south-vergent GC fold-and-thrust belt. Some north-vergent <b>retrothrusts</b> are present in the western GC and a few more in the eastern GC, where a fan-shaped belt can be observed. The mechanisms responsible for the large-scale structure of the belt remain a matter of debate because the deep crustal structure of the GC is not well known. Some (mainly Russian) geoscientists have argued that the GC is an inverted basin squeezed between deep (near) -vertical faults representing the boundaries between the GC and the SP to the north and the GC and the Transcaucasus to the south. Another model, supported in part by the distribution of earthquake hypocentres, proposes the existence of south-vergent thrusts flattening at depth, along which the Transcaucasus plunges beneath the GC and the SP. In this model, a thick-skinned mode of deformation prevailed in the central part of the GC whereas the western and eastern parts display the attributes of thin-skinned fold-and-thrust belts, although, in general, the two styles of deformation coexist along the belt. The present-day high elevation observed only in the central part of the belt would have resulted from the delamination of a lithospheric root. Â© The Geological Society of London 2006...|$|R
40|$|The {{most recent}} period of {{orogenesis}} in southern Alaska began in late Neogene {{time with the}} collision of the Yakutat microplate, which is partially accreted to and partially subducted beneath the Alaskan margin to form the St. Elias Mountains. One of the most dynamic areas within the orogen is the Eastern syntaxis where the Dangerous River Zone (DRZ), a significant structural and lithologic boundary, partitions deformation between dextral transpressive structures associated with the Queen Charlotte-Fairweather fault and the Yakutat fold and thrust belt. The DRZ originated as a suture zone between an oceanic plateau and the continental margin or a previously unrecognized structure within the Chugach accretionary complex, which has implications for the crustal structure beneath the western third of the Yakutat microplate. ^ Neotectonic studies suggest significant spatial and kinematic variation in active deformation during the collision of the Yakutat microplate. The St. Elias orogen experienced a widespread structural reorganization in the Quaternary with oblique convergence accommodated by an en echelon thrust array. The new tectonic configuration also includes the continuing development of an incipient indentor corner, significant <b>retrothrust</b> motion, and shifting deformation fronts. Reorganization is temporally linked to intense glacial erosion {{in the core of}} orogen and rapid sedimentation in offshore depocenters during the Pleistocene. ^ Near the end of the Pleistocene, large tidewater and piedmont glacial complexes began to break up and retreated from the continental shelf resulting in significant isostatic adjustments. Marine to terrestrial sedimentary deposits in the Gulf of Alaska provide constraints on the timing and magnitude of glacial rebound as well as changes in relative sea-level {{at the end of the}} Last Glacial Maximum. Drastic ice retreat resulted in rapid isostatic uplift, which was locally exceeded by equally rapid sea-level rise. ...|$|E
