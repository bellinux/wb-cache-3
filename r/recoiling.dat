5|$|There are {{differences}} between the German and French releases of the film. The character Allan Grey is named David Gray for the German release, which Dreyer attributed to a mistake. The German censors ordered cuts to the film that still exist today in some prints. The scenes {{which had to be}} toned down include the doctor's death under the milled flour and the vampire's death from the stake. There are other scenes that were shot and included in the script that do not exist in any current prints of Vampyr. These scenes reveal the vampire in the factory <b>recoiling</b> against a shadow of a Christian cross as well as a ferryman guiding Gray and Gisèle by getting young children to build a fire and sing a hymn to guide them back to the shore.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} damaged in the engagement, {{although}} Saumarez's damage was almost entirely confined to his rigging: very few shots had actually struck his hull during the battle, {{and the only}} one that provoked notice passed across the deck without causing injury and struck a cannon on the opposite site, setting it off {{in the direction of a}} number of small gunboats that were approaching from the shore. Casualties on Crescent were equally light, with just one man injured; he had been standing too close to his own cannon during the opening broadside and had been struck by the <b>recoiling</b> gun, suffering a broken leg. Damage and losses on the French ship were very severe, with the rigging in tatters, the hull and lower masts repeatedly struck and casualties that Saumarez initially estimated at more than 120 men killed or wounded, although French accounts give the lower figure of 33 killed and 48 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Doggett {{goes off}} alone {{to see the}} woman who guarded the {{creature}} in the woods. The woman implies that Mulder, feeling sorry for the creature, was trying to euthanize the creature, not save Hangemuhl. Doggett hears a noise and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns to {{the woman in the}} woods who watches over the creature; after <b>recoiling</b> at its ugliness, the woman explains that it looks the way it does because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the creature away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman kneels beside the dead soul eater. She weeps over it, revealing that, by eating Doggett's death, it has finally been allowed to die.|$|E

Trying to figure the net <b>recoil</b> energy of a firearm (also known as felt <b>recoil)</b> is a futile endeavor. Even if you can calculate the <b>recoil</b> energy loss due to: muzzle brake; <b>recoil</b> operated action or gas operated action; mercury <b>recoil</b> suppression tube; <b>recoil</b> reducing butt pad and or hand grip; shooting vest and or gloves, the human factor is not calculable.|$|R
5|$|While Seaborg {{applied for}} funding, Harvey {{worked on the}} {{einsteinium}} target, while Thomson and Choppin focused on methods for chemical isolation. Choppin suggested using α-hydroxyisobutyric acid to separate the mendelevium atoms {{from those of the}} lighter actinides. The actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique, introduced by Albert Ghiorso. In this technique, the einsteinium was placed {{on the opposite side of}} the target from the beam, so that the <b>recoiling</b> mendelevium atoms would get enough momentum to leave the target and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold. This recoil target was made by an electroplating technique, developed by Alfred Chetham-Strode. This technique gave a very high yield, which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the einsteinium target material. The recoil target consisted of 109 atoms of 253Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil. It was bombarded by 41MeV alpha particles in the Berkeley cyclotron with a very high beam density of 6×1013 particles per second over an area of 0.05cm2. The target was cooled by water or liquid helium, and the foil could be replaced.|$|E

25|$|While a half-owner of the Brewers, Veeck {{served for}} nearly three years in the United States Marine Corps during World War II in an {{artillery}} unit. During this time a <b>recoiling</b> artillery piece crushed his leg, requiring amputation first of the foot, and shortly after of the leg above the knee. Over the course of his life he had 36 operations on the leg. He had a series of wooden legs and, as an inveterate smoker, cut holes in them to use as an ashtray.|$|E
25|$|A {{recoilless}} rifle (RCLR) or recoilless gun is a lightweight weapon that fires a heavier projectile {{that would be}} impractical to fire from a <b>recoiling</b> weapon of comparable size. Technically, only devices that use a rifled barrel are {{recoilless rifle}}s. Smoothbore variants are recoilless guns. This distinction is often lost, and both are often called recoilless rifles. The key difference from rocket launchers (whether man-portable or not) is that the projectile of the recoilless rifle has no propulsion of its own - once out of the rifle, it does not accelerate further, like a missile or rocket would. Normally used for anti-tank roles, the first effective system of this kind was developed during World War II by William Kroeger and Clarence Musser.|$|E

25|$|Anderson's {{attack was}} poorly coordinated and driven {{back by the}} heavy {{firepower}} of the Union cavalry's Spencer repeating carbines. By 9 a.m. Wright's lead elements arrived at the crossroads, but Wright decided to delay Grant's intended attack until after Smith arrived, which occurred in the afternoon, and the XVIII Corps men began to entrench {{on the right of}} the VI Corps. At 6:30p.m. the attack that Grant had ordered for the morning finally began. Both Wright's and Smith's corps moved forward. Wright's men made little progress south of the Mechanicsville Road, <b>recoiling</b> from heavy fire. North of the road, Brig. Gen. Emory Upton's brigade also met with heavy fire from Brig. Gen. Thomas L. Clingman's brigade and fell back to its starting point. To Upton's right, the brigade of Col. William S. Truex found a gap in the Confederate line through a swampy, brush-filled ravine. As Truex's men charged through the gap, Clingman swung two regiments around to face them, and Anderson sent in Brig. Gen. Eppa Hunton's brigade from his corps reserve. Truex became surrounded on three sides and was forced to withdraw.|$|E
500|$|Kaczynski {{was born}} on May 22, 1942, in Chicago, Illinois, to working-class, second-generation Polish Americans, Wanda Theresa (née Dombek) and Theodore Richard Kaczynski. His parents told his younger brother David Kaczynski that Ted had been a happy baby until severe hives forced him into {{hospital}} isolation with only limited contact with others, after which he [...] "showed little emotion for months". Wanda later recalled Ted <b>recoiling</b> from a picture of himself as an infant being held down by physicians examining his hives, and said he always showed sympathy to animals in cages or otherwise helpless, which she speculated stemmed from his experience in hospital isolation.|$|E
500|$|Beiderbecke {{joined the}} Wolverine Orchestra late in 1923, and the seven-man group first played a speakeasy called the Stockton Club near Hamilton, Ohio. Specializing in hot jazz and <b>recoiling</b> from {{so-called}} sweet music, the band took {{its name from}} {{one of its most}} frequent numbers, Jelly Roll Morton's [...] "Wolverine Blues." [...] During this time, Beiderbecke also took piano lessons from a young woman who introduced him to the works of Eastwood Lane. Lane's piano suites and [...] orchestral arrangements were self-consciously American while still having French Impressionist allusions, and the works are said to have deeply influenced Beiderbecke's style, especially on [...] "In a Mist." [...] A subsequent gig at Doyle's Dance Academy in Cincinnati became the occasion for a series of band and individual photographs that resulted in the most famous image of Beiderbecke—sitting fresh-faced, his hair perfectly combed, his horn resting on his right knee.|$|E

500|$|In 1928, Walter Bothe {{observed}} that beryllium emitted a highly penetrating, electrically neutral radiation when bombarded with alpha particles. It was later discovered that this radiation could knock hydrogen atoms out of paraffin wax. Initially {{it was thought}} to be high-energy gamma radiation, since gamma radiation had a similar effect on electrons in metals, but James Chadwick found that the ionization effect was too strong for it to be due to electromagnetic radiation, so long as energy and momentum were conserved in the interaction. In 1932, Chadwick exposed various elements, such as hydrogen and nitrogen, to the mysterious [...] "beryllium radiation", and by measuring the energies of the <b>recoiling</b> charged particles, he deduced that the radiation was actually composed of electrically neutral particles which could not be massless like the gamma ray, but instead were required to have a mass similar to that of a proton. Chadwick now claimed these particles as Rutherford's neutrons. For his discovery of the neutron, Chadwick received the Nobel Prize in 1935.|$|E
500|$|The fourth devil, Toby (Wally Dalton), is {{convinced}} that Black really does {{know that they are}} demons. Toby also recounts his story, in which he begins to feel ennui at his failure to damn humans for some time. He meets and courts an aging stripper, Sally, who falls in love with him.

Burt Lancaster's fans were not thrilled with their idol either, [...] "finding the film too static and talky". The film was a box office failure, and Hecht blamed his producing partner Hill. [...] "The night of the preview, Harold said to me, 'You know you've wrecked our company? We're going to lose {{over a million dollars}} on this picture,'" [...] Hill recalled. However, Lancaster blamed Lehman, who remembers a confrontation they had: [...] "Burt threatened me at a party after the preview.

500|$|The {{official}} synopsis establishes back-story that is {{not seen}} or referenced {{in the beginning of}} the film, stating that Mrs. Gage turned to her only son for support after losing the last of her savings. Seeking his support, Mrs. Gage arrives at his house and is shown in by her granddaughter, Marie. The son welcomes his mother, but his wife strongly objects to having her mother-in-law take up residence in the house. Shown to her room by Marie, Mrs. Gage makes herself comfortable and gives Marie a kitten. [...] "Granny" [...] quickly becomes friends with little Marie. The wife struggles with Granny's presence, but her patience is tested when Granny knocks over a vase, and in <b>recoiling,</b> knocks over a sewing box. The mother delivers an ultimatum to her husband, [...] "Either your mother or I must leave this house!" [...] Though not shown, the husband decides that his mother is to go.

500|$|On 5 July 1943, {{the first}} day of Operation Citadel (5–16 July 1943), the German code name for the Battle of Kursk, in the Großdeutschland area of operations, the Panther {{battalion}} got bogged down in the mud near Beresowyj and failed to support the Füsiliers attack. Nipe indicates that often Oberst Karl Decker and Oberstleutnant Meinrad von Lauchert have been made responsible for this failure. However, Nipe argues [...] "that it can safely be assumed that Strachwitz was present; thus, any responsibility regarding actions of Großdeutschlands Panzers belongs to the Panzer Count." [...] Following the battle, Decker wrote a letter to Guderian complaining about the unnecessary losses incurred by the Großdeutschland division. In this letter Decker stated that how Strachwitz led his tanks on {{the first day}} of Kursk was [...] "idiotic". Strachwitz was wounded again on 10 July. His battle group had been ordered into combat by Hörnlein. The objective was to capture Hill 258.4, about [...] west of Werchopenje. The battle group encountered roughly 30 Soviet tanks on evening of 9 July. An attack proved unfeasible due to the settling darkness. During these events he received news that his son, Hyacinth, had been severely wounded. At dusk on 10 July he ordered the attack on the Soviet tanks. The first T-34s had been destroyed and Strachwitz was directing the attack from his command Panzer and had ordered his gunner to hold fire. Strachwitz was carelessly resting his left arm on the gun-breech. The gunner, without orders, fired the gun, causing the <b>recoiling</b> gun to smash his left arm. Strachwitz was immediately evacuated to a field hospital. Strachwitz's arm was put in a cast and against medical advice he returned to his regiment.
