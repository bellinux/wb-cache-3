40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{occurrence}} of invasive plants species such as Heracleum mantegazzianum, Solidago canadensis and gigantea, Impatiens glandulifera, <b>Reynoutria</b> japonica, <b>sachalinensis</b> and bohemica., which are the most feared plants in the Czech Republic. Invasions are an environmental problem on a global scale, which is increasingly the more discussed. The mapping {{took place in the}} summer of 2015 on the territory of protected natural region Křivoklátsko, where there is a large extent Sites of Community Importance. The thesis is also focused on the characteristics of the area with European significance. It evaluated the incidence of plant sites, their surface representation and percentage of species in different habitats. Impatiens glandulifera, near Berounka river, was the most surface represented, as the river is the main source of spread for this species. Another occuring species was Solidago canadensis and only two specimen of Reynoutria japonica. The invaded areas expansion on the area of interest is minimal...|$|R
40|$|The {{invasion}} {{of plants and}} animals species are considered as one of the main danger for diversity of natural ecosystems worldwide. With destruction of habitats represent the main reason of the current global wave of taxa extinctions. The obviousness of biological invasions are financial costs in different branches connected with their prevention and liquidation. The main purpose of this master thesis was to evaluate the economic impacts of {{invasion of}} the selected invasive species, concretely Grand hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum), Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), Giant goldenrod and Canadian (Solidago gigantea and canadensis) and also Japanese knotweed, Giant knotweed and Bohemian knotweed (<b>Reynoutria</b> japonica, <b>sachalinensis</b> and × bohemica).

40|$|Resumé The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{summarize}} actual results of the field research of invasive neophytes' occurrence in the riverbank vegetation of selected water courses in the Czech Republic. In total approximately 850 km of the riverbank vegetation was mapped using author's own method. The riverbank vegetation was defined according to Novak et al. (1986) as the vegetation belt along a water course with boundaries represented by the water surface and the riverbank edge. The occurence of 22 most important invasive neophytes (sensu Pyšek et al. 2002) was registered using a logarithmical scale (1 = 1 - 9 specimen, 2 = 10 - 99 specimen, 3 = 100 - 999 specimen etc.). Some related species were not recognized (following species were aggregated together: Galinsoga parviflora and G. ciliata; Solidago gigantea and S. canadensis; Parthenocissus quinquefolia a P. inserta and <b>Reynoutria</b> japonica, R. <b>sachalinensis</b> and R. × bohemica). In total, occurence of 17 taxons was registered. The field research was conducted during the summer period of 2006, 2007 or 2008. Development in the years 2006 and 2008 could be compared for 218 segments, that was mapped in both time relations.

40|$|Abstract: The {{effect of}} {{traditional}} management {{on the initial}} phase of invasion into mesic mown meadows was studied in the Kfivokl~tsko protected landscape area in Central Bohemia, the Czech Republic. In 1996, rhizome fragments of alien species native to Asia, i. e. <b>Reynoutria</b> japonica, R. <b>sachalinensis</b> and their hybrid R. xboheraica were planted in experimental plots and their establishment recorded. Established plants were then subjected to the following six treatments which simulated the management practices traditionally {{used in the study}} area: mowing twice a year, grazing bygoats and sheep separately at wodifferent intensities, and a control plot. Plant survival was recorded in the two years following planting. In order to compare the effect of the growing period, the xperiment with R. japonica was conducted in two subsequent years (1995 and 1996) thus allowing observations ver three years on this species. The experiment was carried out in two sites (meadows), with t ree blocks of treatments e tablished in each. Significantly better establishment was found in R. japonica and R. xbohemica than in R. sachalinensis. Survival of all three taxa was negatively effected by all the management treatments applied (P < 0. 001). In control plots with plants of all three taxa, there was virtually no mortality during the growing seasons of either year and the number of surviving plants decreased only in the winter. In the former two species, 38. 5 + 19. 4 % of plants urvived the first winter, the corresponding figure for the latter being only 7. 2 ± 6. 1 %. It can be concluded that traditional management provided it i...|$|R

40|$|The Bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{invasive}} plant species. Following invasive plant species were mapped in the South Bohemian region of Třeboň: Canadian goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), Giant goldenrod (Solidago gigantea), Bohemian knotweed (Reynoutria x bohemica), Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica), Sakhalin knotweed (<b>Reynoutria</b> <b>sachalinensis)</b> and Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera). The goal of this thesis was to map the above-mentioned species in one part of Stropnice Site of Community Importance and its surroundings. Furthermore, the thesis also aimed to record the most frequently colonized biotopes according to the invaded locations. The results show that Canadian goldenrod colonized seventeen locations and therefore {{it is one of the}} most invasive species. Next, Himalayan balsam was found in seven locations and Japanese knotweed in five locations. Last, Bohemian knotweed and giant goldenrod each colonized only one location. In this area, such species most often invade biotopes affected by people and locations near water resources. The plants also grow mostly in wet localities...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the issue of {{invasive}} plant species around the Stropnice Special Area of Conservation located in the region of Třeboň. The aim of this thesis was to map following invasive plant species: Canadian goldenrod (Solidago canadensis), Giant goldenrod (Solidago gigantea), Japanese knotweed (Reynoutria japonica), Sakhalin knotweed (<b>Reynoutria</b> <b>sachalinensis),</b> Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) and Giant hogweed (Heracleum mantegazzianum). The locations of the above-mentioned species were mapped using GPS. The data were then digitized and map outputs were created using the ArcGIS 10. 2. 2 program. These outputs identified the expansion of the invasive plant species. The results showed that giant hogweed is not located in the mapped area, but the other mapped invasive plant species were found there. These species most often invaded the biotope of mesic Arrhenatherum meadows (T 1. 1), followed by tall-sedge beds (M 1. 7) and anthropogenic areas with sporadic vegetation outside human settlements (X 6). The problem of invasive plant species can be solved by their removal and by educating the general public about the risks these plants pose...|$|E
40|$|My PhD {{thesis is}} focused on study of plant-soil interactions. Chapter 1 {{is focused on}} general {{introduction}} to the interactions between plants and soil biota in terms of relationships between soil organisms and aboveground biomass as well as root biomass. Chapter 2 is focused on food interaction of Folsomia candida and soil microscopic fungi (Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium expansum, Absidia glauca, and Cladosporium herbarum). Fungi were grown separately on Petri dishes or on different litter type (oak, alder and willow) separately as well. Laboratory experiments showed that food preference was more influenced by different litter types than fungal species. In chapter 3 was studied long-term production of hybrid sorrel {{and its effect on}} the composition of the soil meso and macrofauna, basal soil respiration, microbial biomass and composition of cultivable fraction of soil microscopic fungi in comparison with oilseed rape and cultural meadow. There was found that long-term production of hybrid sorrel affects the composition of soil fauna, while the microbial activity of the soil was more affected by agriculture practices, especially tillage.

40|$|One of the {{properties}} of systemically acquired resistance in plants is their concomitance with the biochemical changes including enhancement of activities of defense-related enzymes. The leaf extract of <b>Reynoutria</b> <b>sachalinensis</b> (F. Schmidt) Nakai {{is known to be}} an effective compound for the control of a few plant diseases particularly powdery mildew of cucurbits (caused by fungal pathogen Podosphaera fusca), by inducing host defense responses. In the present investigation, the effects of this extract on some defense responses of cucumber plants were studied via in vivo tests. Changes of defense responses in the extract treated-cucumber plants, with or without pathogen inoculation, were studied and compared with those of non-treated control plants. Results indicated that specific activity of peroxidase increased significantly in treated tissues. Enhancement of enzyme activity showed the same patterns in both the pathogen inoculated- and non-inoculated-plants; thus the pathogen attack did not affect the enzyme activity. Specific activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase in the non-inoculated extract treated-plants showed a transient fast increase during 24 hours after the treatment, whereas in the inoculated ones, it showed a permanent slow increase probably due to the interaction between extract treatment and pathogen attack. Phenolic content of extract treated-plant tissues, despite small fluctuations, did not show any definite pattern of changes...|$|E
40|$|Salinity {{is a major}} {{abiotic factor}} that causes serious {{problems}} in agriculture around the world which leads to reduced crop production. Scientists {{all over the world}} are looking for natural, environment friendly compounds against biotic and abiotic factors. Milsana, a formulated plant extract from <b>Reynoutria</b> <b>sachalinensis,</b> is widely used to elicit plant defences against biotic stress. In addition Milsana has been found to act by enhancing the flavonoid metabolic pathway. Considering the about the effect of Milsana concentration on tomato plants under physiological conditions and under NaCl stress was examined. The experimental approach included the study of the effect of various concentrations of Milsana (0 / 5 %, 1. 0 % and 2. 0 %) on untreated plants and plants under salinity stress (70 mM and 140 mM NaCl). Plant height, fruit quality, antioxidant and photosynthetic capacity were used to determine the response of tomato plants to Milsana, NaCl stress, and their combination. The effect of Milsana was tested in two different sets of experiments, one carried out in growth chambers under controlled conditions and the other carried out in a greenhouse. Milsana led to enhanced growth, when applied to non saline stressed plants. Furthermore the negative effect of NaC 1 on photosynthesis, ROS homeostasis, and fruit quality traits was counteracted by the application of Milsana...|$|E
40|$|Accumulation of {{phenolic}} compounds (p-coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids and p-coumaric acid methyl ester) was followed in susceptible (Mustang) and tolerant (Flamingo) cucumber (Cucumis sativus) cultivars. The {{objective was to}} determine whether these compounds played a role in resistance against powdery mildew following a prophylactic treatment with Milsana (leaf extracts from the giant knot weed <b>Reynoutria</b> <b>sachalinensis,</b> polygonaceae). This treatment significantly reduced the incidence of powdery mildew in both cultivars. Phenolic compounds were extracted from leaves. In the hydrolyzed fraction containing phenolic aglycones, levels of p-coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids and of p-coumaric acid methyl ester increased in all treatments (with leaf extracts of R. Sachalinensis, powdery mildew, or both) except the control, one or two days after treatment. In the fraction containing free phenolics, from the tested compounds, only ferulic acid showed an increase in cv. Flamingo (tolerant), and was particularly evident following treatments. On the other hand, the amounts of hydroxycinnamic acids increased rapidly in the two cultivars following Milsana treatment, suggesting their role in disease reduction. All compounds showed antifungal activity when tetsed against common pathogens of cucumber (Botrytis cinerea, Pythium ultimum, and P. aphanidermatum), but in general methyl esters were more fungitoxic than their corresponding free acids. This study suggests that cucumber is able to release antifungal compounds that are instrumental in repressing powdery mildew infection. This response is seemingly independent from the level of genetic resistance associated with each cultivar. Peer reviewe...|$|E

The nomenclature of the species were united by Key to the Flora of the Czech Republic by Kubát et al. (2002). A total of 18 species were found in 561 locations. The most numerous species from all locations include: Conyza canadensis (207 locations), Solidago canadensis (147), Robinia pseudoacacia (125), Symphoricarpos albus (89) and Parthenocissus inserta (77). The least numerous are: Pinus strobus (1), Reynoutria bohemica (6), Impatiens parviflora (7) and Rhus hirta (9). Five species from the designed species list were not found: Heracleum mantegazzianum, <b>Reynoutria</b> <b>sachalinensis,</b> Impatiens glandulifera, Senecio inaequidens and Rudbeckia laciniata. Species that were most represented along the roads include: Solidago canadensis and S. gigantea, Conyza canadensis and Aster lanceolatus and A. novi-belgii.

40|$|Polyphenolic {{substances}} {{contained in}} many plants possess strong antioxidant activity. One of the perspective plants for obtaining polyphenols manifesting pharmacological effects is the giant knotweed or the Sakhalin knotweed, syn. Polygonum sachalinense F. Schmidt, syn. Fallopia sachalinensis Ronse Dec r., <b>Reynoutria</b> <b>sachalinensis</b> Nakai, Tiniaria sachalinensis Janch. This plant has been adapted for conditions of Republic of Moldova by scientists of Botanical Garden (Institute), who have bred a new variety GIGANT. The leaves {{have been collected}} during the entire season at different vegetation stages, namely at 20, 60, 150 and 180 days of growing up. The extracts from leaves and flowers have been prepared using water-ethanol solution with concentration of 70 %. The total polyphenolic content has been determined by Folin-Ciocalteu procedure and calculated in gallic acid equivalent. At the beginning of intensive development of plants (on 20 th day) the leaves contained about 5. 31 ± 0. 05 mg of polyphenols per g of fresh weight. During the period of 20 - 60 growing days the accumulation of polyphenolic substances in leaves increased fast and their content reached to value of 20. 45 ± 0. 32 mg/g. The maximal content of polyphenols in leaves {{as well as in}} flowers was detected at the stage of abundant flowering at 150 th growing day. In this stage the flowers contained 1. 2 times more polyphenolic substances than the leaves. This balance changed substantially in period of seed formation (180 days), when the content of polyphenols in leaves decreased insignificantly from 28. 90 ± 0. 26 to 24. 20 ± 0. 62 mg/g, but in flowers this index dropped by 4. 5 times. This fact reflected the physiological changes in plants associated with processes of seed formation and their preparation for winter. Thus, leaves and flowers of giant knotweed in conditions of Republic of Moldova accumulated polyphenols in big quantities, which justifies its use as a medicinal plant and a new source of valuable bioactive substances. </p...|$|E
