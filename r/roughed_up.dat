25|$|When Rena Price {{reached the}} {{intersection}} of Avalon Boulevard and 116th Street that evening, she scolded Frye about drinking and driving, as he recalled in a 1985 interview with the Orlando Sentinel. The situation quickly escalated: someone shoved Price, Frye was struck, Price jumped an officer, and another officer pulled out a shotgun. Backup police officers attempted to arrest Frye by using physical force to subdue him. After rumors spread {{that the police had}} <b>roughed</b> <b>up</b> Frye and kicked a pregnant woman, angry mobs formed.

25|$|Glamorgan won the toss at a cold Edgbaston {{and chose}} to bat. The pitch hade been <b>roughed</b> <b>up</b> to {{encourage}} {{turn for the}} benefit of Ashley Giles. The England selectors will have been pleased that he made the most of it, taking 6 for 44, the third-best figures of his career. First, however, Matthew Elliott, Glamorgan's Australian batsman scored 84 to take his team to a comfortable looking 157 for 3. However, Glamorgan then lost their final seven wickets for just 41 runs. Warwickshire's catching was excellent, as they restricted their opposition to 198 off 63.3 overs, two short of their first bonus point. Nick Knight and Mark Wagh then saw Warwickshire through to 68 for no loss, before bad light stopped play.|$|E

Disturbances broke out during the first game in Tegucigalpa, but the situation got considerably worse during the second match in San Salvador. Honduran fans were <b>roughed</b> <b>up,</b> the Honduran flag and national anthem were insulted, and the emotions of both nations became considerably agitated.

25|$|The {{most infamous}} {{declaration}} {{of politics and}} sport was the Football War between El Salvador and Honduras. Though the build-up to the war {{had to do with}} more socio-economic issues like immigration and land reform, the impetus for war was an inflammation of tensions set off by rioters during the second North American qualifying round for the 1970 FIFA World Cup. Disturbances broke out during the first game in Tegucigalpa, but the second leg saw the situation get considerably worse in San Salvador. Honduran fans were <b>roughed</b> <b>up,</b> the Honduran flag and national anthem were insulted, and the emotions of both nations became considerably agitated. In retaliation, violence against Salvadoran residents in Honduras, including several Vice Consuls, increased. An unknown number of Salvadorans were killed or brutalized, and tens of thousands began fleeing the country. The press of both nations contributed to a growing climate of near-hysteria, and on June 27, 1969, twelve days after the second-leg game, Honduras broke diplomatic relations with El Salvador. On July 14, 1969, the Salvadoran army launched an attack against Honduras. The Organization of American States negotiated a cease-fire which took effect on July 20, with the Salvadoran troops withdrawn in early August.|$|E

The Dodgers then proceeded to be blown out 12–2 as Troy Tulowitzki slugged two homers and Melvin Mora hit a grand slam, while John Ely was <b>roughed</b> <b>up</b> in the loss. The Dodgers fell behind 6–1 in the series finale, but came back to send the game into extra innings, finally winning the game 7–6 on a walk-off hit by A. J. Ellis in the 11th inning. The Dodgers two-year stay as National League Western Division champions came to an end on September 21 when they were officially eliminated from post-season contention when the Giants beat the Cubs. The Dodgers then proceeded to be shut out by the Padres 6–0, the first career shutout for Padres starter Clayton Richard and the 17th time the Dodgers had been shut out in 2010, the most in the league and their highest total since 1989. In the next game, Ted Lilly struck out eight in seven innings, but the Dodgers managed just three hits in a 3–1 defeat. The Dodgers avoided being swept at home due to Hiroki Kuroda's eight-inning, one-run performance in the Dodgers' 3–1 win over the Padres.|$|E

500|$|The Sugar Act of 1764 and the Stamp Act of 1765 {{severely}} curtailed mercantile {{trade in}} the colonies. [...] The latter act prompted Arnold to join the chorus of voices in opposition to those taxes, and also led to his entry into the Sons of Liberty, a secret organization that was not afraid to use violence to oppose implementation of those and other unpopular Parliamentary measures. Arnold initially took no part in any public demonstrations but, like many merchants, continued to trade as if the Stamp Act did not exist, in effect becoming a smuggler {{in defiance of the}} act. [...] Arnold also faced financial ruin, falling £16,000 in debt, with creditors spreading rumors of his insolvency {{to the point where he}} took legal action against them. On the night of January 28, 1767, Arnold and members of his crew, watched by a crowd of Sons of Liberty, <b>roughed</b> <b>up</b> a man suspected of attempting to inform authorities of Arnold's smuggling. Arnold was convicted of a disorderly conduct charge and fined the relatively small amount of 50 shillings; publicity of the case and widespread sympathy for his view probably contributed to the light sentence.|$|E

500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalized}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 6 reviews, and {{scored higher than}} any other album by Clarkson. AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave it a rating of three-and-a-half out of five stars. He described its uptempo arrangements, as well as Clarkson's vocal performance, as [...] "bold and brassy" [...] and its mid-tempo arrangements as [...] "even more alluring". He also noted the track selection [...] "favors the bold," [...] but that [...] "she fares well in this setting, always sounding like the strongest element in the mix". Towards {{the end of his}} review, he wrote: [...] "Perhaps the concept and execution are conventional, but even in this utterly expected setting, Clarkson retains her fiery, individual spirit, and that's what makes Wrapped in Red appealing: to the letter, it delivers what it promises." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine also gave it a similar rating. He noted that the album [...] "largely offers a respite from the pop-rock template she's been relentlessly pursuing since Breakaway, with less shouting and more of the varied range and texture on full display that helped coronate her the winner of the inaugural season of American Idol. For better or worse, a decade of recording and touring has <b>roughed</b> <b>up</b> the edges of her voice, lending a lived-in quality that imbues lyrics about love and longing with an authenticity that might have otherwise been missing had she recorded these songs just a few years earlier." ...|$|E
