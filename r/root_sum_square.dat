40|$|In {{preparation}} for the fourth satellite in the CubeSat program at the Julius-Maximilians-Universität in Würzburg, a real-time orbit determination algorithm was developed. Due to strict power and volumetric constraints, {{the goal was to}} make use of sensors already existing onboard the third satellite in the program, called UWE- 3. The algorithm implemented is an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that makes use of magnetometer and sun sensor measurements in its update step. It is attitude independent as it uses only the norm of the magnetic field, and the cosine of the angle between the magnetic field and the sun vector. The propagation step models the satellite dynamics as a two-body problem with J 2 perturbations. The update step uses the International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) and a model of the earth's movement around the sun as references.

The knowledge of all possible variations in an assembly due to the specified tolerances is essential to ensure universal interchangeability. Tolerance zone, as defined in [1], is a virtual region formed around a true feature. Tolerance zone propagation can be effectively used to observe variations due to individual part tolerances in an assembly. Although the concept of tolerance zones is not explicitly used in most existing tolerance analysis methods, the underlying principles can be readily used to generate a tolerance zone. However, it is seen that tolerance zones generated by Worst Case or <b>Root</b> <b>Sum</b> <b>Square</b> (RSS) models do not encompass all possible variations inan assembly made of parts that are within tolerance specification, because the effect of non-worst case stacking situations is not considered. The new perspective on tolerance analysis, discussed in this paper, addresses the effect of non-worst case stacking situations by studying angular accumulation in addition to linear accumulation of tolerances. In a general plus/minus tolerance part there is a high probability that the part conforms to the specified tolerances with a surface that is not at the true angular position with respect to other features. Such parts when assembled together lead to angular stack-up. In this paper, angular accumulation is addressed using the concept of tolerance zones and a mathematical basis is developed for the representation and analysis of angular accumulation based on classical kinematic theories. Possible applications of this analysis are also discussed. 2 ̆...|$|E

The barotropic model with tidal and atmospheric forcing and the atmospheric wind fields allow us to evaluate the forces acting on the MGT. The sea surface slope force dominates the budget. Calving occurred when high tide and strong nontidal currents (due to atmospheric forcing) combined to lead to the monthly maximum forces exerted on the MGT (i. e., between 10 and 13 February 2010).

The model, which is configured from the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS), is three-level nested with the finest resolution of 1. 6 km in the Monterey Bay, California. Forced by tidal signal along the open boundaries in west, north and south directions, ROMS can simulate barotropic tides reasonably well in the region. The total discrepancy of the amplitudes of eight major tide constituents, as measured by <b>root</b> of <b>summed</b> <b>squares,</b> is 3. 5 cm in the open ocean compared with tide amplitudes estimated by Topex/POSEIDON along-track altimetry observation. Along the coastal region, the discrepancy of amplitudes is 5. 4 cm which is about 10 % of the amplitude of the most energetic M 2 constituent. For these major tide constituents, the phase error is generally much less than half hour. The simulated sea surface tidal current, which is heavily influenced by internal tide activity, shows sensitivity to stratification. 1...|$|R
