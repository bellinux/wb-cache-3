5|$|The {{alkylation}} <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> {{more widely}} used than the acylation reaction, although its practice is more technically demanding because the <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> more sluggish. For both reactions, the aluminium chloride, {{as well as}} other materials and the equipment, should be dry, although a trace of moisture is necessary for the reaction to proceed. A general problem with the Friedel–Crafts <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> that the aluminium chloride catalyst sometimes is required in full stoichiometric quantities, because it complexes strongly with the products. This complication sometimes generates a large amount of corrosive waste. For these and similar reasons, more recyclable or environmentally benign catalysts have been sought. Thus, the use of aluminium trichloride in some applications is being displaced by zeolites.|$|E

40|$|Cellular {{reactions}} {{caused by}} tuberculin, various tuberculin fractions and various non-specific stimuli were studied in tuberculous animals. The <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> then {{compared with those}} in the Arthus phenomenon caused by tuberculin in animals previously sensitized with tuberculin. At an early stage tuberculin <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> evidently leukocytic, later monocytic <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> dominant. Apparently this process of the cellular <b>reactions</b> <b>is</b> related to the quantity of tuberculin injected. In general the cellular response, in tuberculin <b>reactions</b> <b>was</b> of a monocytic type, while that in the Arthus phenomenon was leukocytic. The difference between them seemed to be {{due to the fact that}} the tuberculin showed a reaction of a delayed type. These monocytic <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> more intense when purified tuberculin was used. The histological changes in the intracutaneous tuberculin <b>reaction</b> <b>were</b> fundamentally due to the vascular <b>reaction,</b> and <b>were</b> somewhat similar to those in the Arthus phenomenon, but at least a part of the regressive changes of the epidermis and the cutis, which were simultaneously observed, seemed to he primary when considered from the findings on the intracorneal reactions...|$|R
5|$|This {{phosphorylation}} <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> an equilibrium, {{which can}} be shifted by altering the proton-motive force. In {{the absence of a}} proton-motive force, the ATP synthase reaction will run from right to left, hydrolyzing ATP and pumping protons out of the matrix across the membrane. However, when the proton-motive force is high, the <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> forced to run in the opposite direction; it proceeds from left to right, allowing protons to flow down their concentration gradient and turning ADP into ATP. Indeed, in the closely related vacuolar type H+-ATPases, the hydrolysis <b>reaction</b> <b>is</b> used to acidify cellular compartments, by pumping protons and hydrolysing ATP.|$|E

Documented adverse drug <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> assessed and analyzed for incidence, purpose of visit, types, drug classes, individual drug causing adverse drug reactions, type of cutaneous reaction, and various predisposing factors. Management and outcome of the adverse drug <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> also studied. Adverse drug <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> also assessed for causality, using Naranjo&#x 2032;s scale, severity, and preventability, using Hartwig et al. scale. Adverse drug reaction attributes to 77 &#x 0025; of the hospital visit. Incidence of reported cutaneous adverse drug <b>reactions,</b> <b>were</b> 2. 85 &#x 0025;. Majority of the adverse drug reactions (96 &#x 0025;) were of type B. Antibiotics (30 &#x 0025;), were the common class of drugs, causing a cutaneous adverse drug reactions. Maximum number of adverse drug <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> due to Acetaminophen, Amoxicillin, antitubercular drugs, and Phenytoin. Most of the adverse drug <b>reactions</b> <b>were</b> managed by withdrawal of drug (81 &#x 0025;), and 58 &#x 0025; patients were recovered from the reaction. Naranjos scale classifies, 29 as probable, 21 as possible, and 3 as definite adverse drug reactions.
