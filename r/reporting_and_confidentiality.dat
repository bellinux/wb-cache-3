40|$|Accordingly, it is {{necessary}} that some independent body have the authority both to review research contracts for compliance with norms of subject protection and ethical integrity, and to reject studies that fail to meet ethical standards. Such review should take place {{prior to the start of}} research, not later. Because of its expertise and authority, the institutional ethics review board (IRB or REB) is the appropriate body to undertake such review. Much recent commentary has focused on contractual restrictions on the investigator's freedom to publish research findings. The Olivieri experience, and that of other investigators, has brought freedom of publication issues into sharp focus. Clinical study agreements also raise a number of other ethical issues relating to human subjects and research integrity, however, including disclosures relating to patient safety, data analysis <b>and</b> <b>reporting,</b> budget, <b>confidentiality,</b> <b>and</b> premature termination of the study. This paper describes the ethical issues at stake in structuring such agreements and suggests ethical standards to guide institutional ethics review...|$|R
40|$|All of {{the papers}} in this session are {{concerned}} with striking a balance between concerns about protecting the confidentiality of respondents, whether these are individuals or households, and reducing response burden. In {{the case of the}} paper by Bates and her colleagues, data are potentially shared between individuals within the same household, and this is designed to increase interviewing efficiency (and interview consistency, although, it should be noted, the consistency may be spurious, brought about by the method of interviewing used). The other two papers focus on potential data sharing among federal agencies {{in order to reduce the}} burden on business establishments of responding to multiple similar survey requests. The Nichols <b>and</b> Willimack study <b>reports</b> on qualitative interviews with members of the corporate reporting staff in 30 large multi-unit firms in order to explore their attitudes toward <b>reporting</b> burden <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> protection. The authors believe that, since more information is already publicly available about large businesses than about individuals, especially publicly owned businesses, information obtained about such companies may not require the same stringent confidentiality protections as those afforded information obtained about individuals. It is also true that, unlike individuals, who are ordinarily not selected for more than on...|$|R

40|$|Athlete support {{personnel}} (ASP) implement {{drug control}} policies for sport, such as anti-doping. Interviews with 39 ASP reveal how differences between {{policy and practice}} play out in their "lived experience" of anti-doping. While most ASP support the ideology underlying anti-doping at a "common sense" level (using popular drug and sporting discourses such as "drugs are bad" and sporting virtue), they are critical of anti-doping practice. Combined with no direct experience with doping, ASP saw doping as a rare event unlikely to emerge in practice. Most ASP took a laissez-faire approach to anti-doping, relying on managers {{to know what to}} do in the unlikely event of a doping incident. Despite broadly supporting the ideas of anti-doping, ASP raised concerns around implementation with regards to Athlete Whereabouts and recreational drug use. In response to hypothetical doping events, a number of ASP would seek to persuade the athlete to discontinue doping rather than meet mandatory reporting obligations. Part of this extended from conflicts between professional and anti-doping obligations (e. g. mandatory <b>reporting</b> <b>and</b> patient <b>confidentiality).</b> ASP demonstrate anti-doping policies are in tension with a practice that systematically normalises substance based performance enhancement early in sporting careers. Anti-doping agencies need to do more to engage with ASP as the "front line" of drug management in sport, including resolving contradictions across policies and in practice...|$|R

40|$|Objectives - The study aims {{to explore}} within the {{community}} pharmacy practice context the views of mental health stakeholders on: (1) current and past experiences of privacy, <b>confidentiality</b> <b>and</b> support; and (2) expectations and needs in relation to privacy <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> Methods - In-depth interviews and focus groups were conducted in three states in Australia, namely Queensland, the northern region of New South Wales and Western Australia, between December 2011 and March 2012. Key findings - There were 98 participants consisting of consumers and carers (n= 74), health professionals (n= 13) and representatives from consumer organisations (n= 11). Participants highlighted a need for improved staff awareness. Consumers indicated a desire to receive information {{in a way that}} respects their privacy <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality,</b> in an appropriate space. Areas identified that require improved protection of privacy <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> during pharmacy interactions were the number of staff having access to sensitive information, workflow models causing information exposure and pharmacies' layout not facilitating private discussions. Challenges experienced by carers created feelings of isolation which could impact on care. Conclusions - This study explored mental health stakeholders' experiences and expectations regarding privacy <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> in the Australian community pharmacy context. A need for better pharmacy staff training about the importance of privacy <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>and</b> strategies to enhance compliance with national pharmacy practice requirements was identified.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{investigate}} the tradeoff between performance <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> in signature-based air indexing schemes for wireless data broadcast. Two metrics, namely false drop probability and false guess probability, are defined {{to quantify the}} filtering efficiency <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> loss of a signature scheme. Our analysis reveals that false drop probability and false guess probability share a similar trend as the tuning parameters of a signature scheme change and {{it is impossible to}} achieve a low false drop probability and a high false guess probability simultaneously. In order to balance the performance <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality,</b> we perform an analysis to provide a guidance for parameter settings of the signature schemes to meet different system requirements. In addition, we propose the jump pointer technique and the XOR signature scheme to further improve the performance <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality.</b> A comprehensive simulation has been conducted to validate our findings.

This study {{aimed to explore}} various cadres of providers' experiences in providing HIV testing services and their understanding of elements that impact on quality of service in Zambia. Sixteen in-depth interviews and two focus group discussions were conducted with HIV testing service providers including lay counselors, nurses and laboratory personnel at purposively selected HIV testing sites at a national reference hospital in Lusaka. Qualitative content analysis was adopted for data analysis. Lay counselors <b>and</b> nurses <b>reported</b> <b>confidentiality</b> <b>and</b> privacy to be greatly compromised due to limited space in both in- and out-patient settings. Difficulties in upholding consent were reported in provider-initiated testing in in-patient settings. The providers identified non-adherence to testing procedures, high workload and inadequate training and supervision as key elements impacting on quality of testing. Difficulties related to testing varied by sub-groups of providers: lay counselors, in finger pricking and obtaining adequate volumes of specimen; non-laboratory providers in general, in interpreting invalid, false-negative and false-positive results. The providers had been participating in a recently established national HIV quality assurance program, i. e. proficiency testing, but rarely received site supervisory visits. Task-shifting coupled with policy shifts in service provision has seriously challenged HIV testing quality, protection of <b>confidentiality</b> <b>and</b> the process of informed consent.
