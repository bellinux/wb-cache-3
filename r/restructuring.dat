5|$|President John Patrick Crecine {{proposed}} a controversial <b>restructuring</b> in 1988. The Institute {{at that point}} had three colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Management, and the catch-all COSALS, the College of Sciences and Liberal arts. Crecine reorganized the latter two into the College of Computing, the College of Sciences, and the Ivan Allen College of Management, Policy, and International Affairs. Crecine announced the changes without asking for input, and consequently many faculty members disliked him for his top-down management style. The administration sent out ballots in 1989, and the proposed changes passed with very slim margins. The <b>restructuring</b> took effect in January 1990. While Crecine was seen in a poor light at the time, the changes he made are considered visionary. In January 1994, Crecine resigned.|$|E

5|$|Since its predecessor's {{inception}} in 1953, Burger King has used several variations of franchising {{to expand its}} operations. In the United States, the company originally relied on a regional franchise model with owners having exclusive expansion rights in a defined geographic territory. This model proved to be problematic as it led to issues of food quality, procedures and image management. A 1970s attempt by one of its largest franchises {{to take over the}} chain led to a <b>restructuring</b> of its franchising system, tossing the old method in favor of a restricted, per store licensing model. The 1978 <b>restructuring,</b> led by a new director of operations, firmly placed the mantel of franchise oversight on the shoulders of the company.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the MMPI- 2 <b>restructured</b> clinical scales and the original clinical scales was evaluated using an outpatient clinical sample (N = 150). Similar patterns of cor-relations to those reported by Tellegen et al. in 2003, such as high correlations between the <b>restructured</b> scales and their original scale counterparts and lower intercorrelations among the <b>restructured</b> scales than among the original scales, {{were found in the}} outpatient sample. The former provided evidence of convergence between the two sets of scales, whereas the lat-ter increases the potential for discriminant validity in the <b>restructured</b> scale profiles. Mean T-scores of the <b>restructured</b> scales were significantly lower than their original scale counter-parts for every clinical scale except Scale 1 (hypochondriasis). Individual profiles exhibited fewer scale elevations using the <b>restructured</b> clinical scales (M = 2. 15, Mdn = 2. 0) than the original clinical scales (M = 3. 29, Mdn = 3. 0).

5|$|As {{part of the}} <b>restructuring,</b> 3G {{also moved}} to change many aspects of {{corporate}} operations throughout 2011-2012.

Other new or reformulated products would follow. In terms of its franchise operations, Burger King initiated a move to become more like competitors Subway and KFC and began to sell off the majority of corporately owned restaurants {{in order to become}} an exclusive franchised operation. 3G also moved to mend relations with its American franchises, which had become rather rancorous during TPG's tenure.

5|$|As the new decade began, KKR began <b>restructuring</b> RJR. In January 1990, it {{completed}} {{the sale of}} RJR's Del Monte Foods to a group led by Merrill Lynch. KKR had originally identified a group of divisions that it could sell to reduce debt. Over the coming years, RJR would pursue a number of additional restructurings, equity injections and public offerings of stock to provide the company with added financial flexibility. KKR contributed $1.7 billion of new equity into RJR in July 1990 to complete a <b>restructuring</b> of the company's balance sheet that appeased unhappy bondholders. KKR's equity contribution {{as part of the}} original leveraged buyout of RJR had been only $1.5 billion. In mid-December 1990, RJR announced an exchange offer that would swap debt in RJR for a new public stock in the company, effectively an unusual means of taking RJR public again and simultaneously reducing debt on the company.|$|E

5|$|Following {{through on}} the CEO's opinion that the company needed a {{consistent}} marketing plan and management team to succeed, the company began its moves by replacing its chairman and CEO Jerry W. Levin with its own choice of executives, Barry J. Gibbons, {{chairman and managing director}} of Grand Metropolitan Retailing, Ltd., as chief executive and Ian A. Martin, Grand Met's top executive in the United States, as chairman. The moves came to no surprise to Wall Street analysts and franchisees, as they were expected due to reservations about Levin after his appointment by the outgoing management at Pillsbury. Grand Met's first major <b>restructuring</b> move was the dismantling of Burger Kings 50-year-old purchasing and distribution arm, Distron. Unhappy with the distribution group, the company originally thought to dispose of the division after the purchase but instead decided to reorganize it into two separate groups, one for procurement (Burger King Purchasing or BKP) and another for distribution (Burger King Distribution Services or BKDS). With the <b>restructuring,</b> the company eliminated many positions and ended up laying off over a hundred staff members as a consequence.|$|E
