Most households use the freezer-on-top-and-refrigerator-on-bottom style, which has been the basic style since the 1940s.

50|$|In {{order for}} {{consumers}} {{to better understand the}} different energy efficiencies and cost associated with appliance options, appliances must be labeled to give consumers this information.

50|$|A vapor {{compression}} {{cycle is}} used in most household refrigerators, <b>refrigerator-freezers</b> and freezers. In this cycle, a circulating refrigerant such as R134a enters a compressor as low-pressure vapor at or slightly below {{the temperature of the}} refrigerator interior. The vapor is compressed and exits the compressor as high-pressure superheated vapor. The superheated vapor travels under pressure through coils or tubes that make up the condenser; the coils or tubes are passively cooled by exposure to air in the room. The condenser cools the vapor, which liquefies. As the refrigerant leaves the condenser, it is still under pressure but is now only slightly above room temperature. This liquid refrigerant is forced through a metering or throttling device, also known as an expansion valve (essentially a pin-hole sized constriction in the tubing) to an area of much lower pressure. The sudden decrease in pressure results in explosive-like flash evaporation of a portion (typically about half) of the liquid. The latent heat absorbed by this flash evaporation is drawn mostly from adjacent still-liquid refrigerant, a phenomenon known as auto-refrigeration. This cold and partially vaporized refrigerant continues through the coils or tubes of the evaporator unit. A fan blows air from the refrigerator or freezer compartment ("box air") across these coils or tubes and the refrigerant completely vaporizes, drawing further latent heat from the box air. This cooled air is returned to the refrigerator or freezer compartment, and so keeps the box air cold. Note that the cool air in the refrigerator or freezer is still warmer than the refrigerant in the evaporator. Refrigerant leaves the evaporator, now fully vaporized and slightly heated, and returns to the compressor inlet to continue the cycle.|$|E

40|$|In {{almost all}} {{domestic}} refrigerators-freezers all components are {{assembled in the}} same relative position since several years ago. It is also known that the condenser releases heat at high temperatures (first law of thermodynamics) {{as well as the}} compressor. This heat is rejected to the environment in almost all practical situations partially by natural air convection. However, part of it is due to thermal radiation that causes an overheating of the <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> surfaces adjacent to those equipments. As a consequence there are more heat gains to the <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> through these surfaces and hence higher air temperatures inside. This paper describes how a simple technique can be very useful in order to minimize that part of heat transfer by radiation. The improvement is achieved by placing a radiation shield - a sheet of aluminium foil - over the surfaces close to the condenser and the compressor. For validating this technique a <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> was monitored with thermocouples for the measurements of the inside air temperatures in two situations: with and without the radiation shield. Results show that with this practice the average inside air temperatures in the <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> could decrease to about 2 K. An available commercial code was used in order to simulate the air temperature distribution and air velocities inside the refrigerator cabinet in both situations. Results from the experimental apparatus and from simulations show that there is a good agreement between them which validates the experiments carried out. Also an available commercial code, the Fluent, was used to simulate the internal air temperature in both situations. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd and IIR...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} frost {{formation}} {{on the performance}} of a domestic <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> evaporator coil was investigated. A low temperature evaporator test facility was developed to closely simulate <b>refrigerator-freezer</b> conditions. The rate of frost deposition on the evaporator was determined to be constant with respect to time for a ten-hour testing period over a range of air inlet temperatures and relative humidities, refrigerant temperatures, and airflow rates. Higher humidities and air inlet temperatures and lower refrigerant temperatures were found to increase the frosting rate significantly. Varying the airflow rate was found to slightly affect the frosting rate. Increasing the airflow rate increased the frosting rate a small amount, while, decreasing the airflow rate decreased the frosting rate an equally small amount. However, it appears that the actual correlation between airflow rate and frosting rate is not this straight-forward, but is, instead, the result of the influences of the mass transfer coefficient, the evaporator surface temperature, and the air moisture capacity. How these factors balance one another determines the actual relationship between frost rate and airflow. rate.
