In 1993, in his article ‘A new strongly minimal set’ Hrushovski produced a family of counterexamples to Zilber’s conjecture. His method consists in two steps. Firstly he builds a ‘limit’ structure from a suitable class of finite structures in a language consisting only of a ternary <b>relational</b> <b>symbol.</b> Secondly, in a step called the collapse, he defines a continuum of subclasses such that the corresponding ‘limit’ structures are new strongly minimal structures. These new strongly minimal structures are non isomorphic but Hrushovski then asks if they are geometrically equivalent. We first analyze the pregeometries arising from different variations of the construction before the collapse. In particular we prove that if we repeat the construction starting with an n-ary <b>relational</b> <b>symbol</b> instead of a 3 -ary <b>relational</b> <b>symbol,</b> then the pregeometries associated to the corresponding ‘limit’ structures are not locally isomorphic when we vary the arity.

Students were asked to define the equal sign and to rate six fictitious students ’ definitions of the equal sign. Elementary school students interpreted the equal sign as an operational symbol meaning the answer or the total in all contexts, whereas undergraduate and graduate students viewed it as a <b>relational</b> <b>symbol</b> of equivalence in all contexts.

With this goal in mind, we have developed Functional Strips, a language that adds first-class function symbols to Strips providing additional flexibility in the codification of planning problems. This extension is orthogonal and complementary to extensions accommodated in other languages such as conditional effects, quantification, negation, etc. Function <b>symbols,</b> unlike <b>relational</b> <b>symbols,</b> can be nested so objects need not be referred to by their explicit names and as a result more efficient encodings can be provided.

40|$|Symbolic {{execution}} is {{a technique}} enabling the automatic generation of test inputs that exercise a set of execution paths within a code unit to be tested. If the paths cover a sufficient part of the code under test, the test data offer a representative view of the actual behaviour of this code. This notably enables detecting errors and correcting faults. Relational databases are ubiquitous in software, but symbolic execution of code units that manipulate them remains a non-trivial problem, particularly because of the complex structure of such databases and the complex behaviour of SQL statements. Finding errors in such code units is yet critical, as it can avoid corrupting important data. In this work, we define a symbolic execution translating database manipulation code directly into constraints and integrate it with a more traditional symbolic execution of normal program code. The database tables are represented by <b>relational</b> <b>symbols</b> and the SQL statements by relational constraints over these symbols. An algorithm based on these principles is presented for the symbolic execution of simple Java methods that implement transactional use cases by reading and writing in a relational database, the latter subject to data integrity constraints.

The target language for the constraints produced by the tool is the SMT-Lib standard and the used solver is Microsoft Z 3.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a study of a fifth-grade class and their {{understanding}} of mathematical equivalence and if their understanding affects how they solve algebraic word problems. Within their understanding of mathematical equivalence the equal sign plays an important part. This study is based on former research about the main topic (Chesney & McNeil. 2014; Kieran. 1981; Knuth et al. 2006) that detected many pupils in elementary school with an operational understanding of the equal sign. Therefor the pupils have misconceptions {{about the meaning of}} the equal sign not being a <b>relational</b> mathematical <b>symbol,</b> but they view the sign as a "do something signal" (Knuth et al. 2006). This interpretation could take part in weakening the development of the pupils conceptual understanding of mathematical equivalence and will therefore influence the pupil’s algebraic results. My two research questions are as follow: 1. What kind of understanding does a fifth-grade class show about mathematical equivalence? 2. How do pupils, with different understanding about mathematical equivalence, solve algebraic word problems? In this study, I use a qualitative research design and within the design I take use of case study and multiple case study as methods. To answer my first research question the students completed mathematical tasks constructed to reveal their understand of mathematical equivalence. To increase the validity of this study I analysed the result and compared it to their general mathematical abilities. To evaluate the pupils understanding I included their interpretation of the equal sign and its role in mathematics, and I looked at the students’ performance in solving equivalence problems. To answer my second research question, I completed to task-based interviews with pupils that previously had been categorized with different understanding of mathematical equivalence. The pupils had to solve five algebraic word problems and I analysed their performance based on their task reasoning and strategic choices. The result of the analysis revealed that about 45 % of the pupils in this fifth-grade class showed signs of operational understand, and about 48 % was categorized with a good understanding of mathematical equivalence. The result is coherent with the previous research mentioned before. One of my findings was that some of the equivalence tasks had higher failure rate and was therefore more challenging than others. My analysis showed that the format of the tasks had a direct link with the result and the pupil’s achievements. I also found a strong connection between the students that showed good understanding of equivalence and a relational interpretation of the equal sign. When it comes to the pupils solving of algebraic word problems, the result from the analysis showed that students with different understanding of mathematical equivalence had different solving processes. Pupils that was categorized with operational understanding used almost exclusively strategies that is related to elementary word problems that shows no signs of understanding the functional relationship between the values. On the other hand, the students that was categorized with good understanding of equivalence used multiple strategies that showed understanding of the notion of balancing two sides of an equation.

40|$|ABSTRACT Creative {{industries}} enjoy a {{great deal}} of attention in Western economies these days. Creative industries can be identified in sectors producing new artistic artefacts, such as those occurring in the film industry, or in the performing arts, etc., or in the manufacturing and service sectors, where the implementation of novelties is at the heart of the productive capabilities of firms. Post-modern consumption is strongly characterized by fashion, because it assists the fragmentation and an ‘‘aestheticization’’ of daily life. Fashion goods become symbolic <b>relational</b> goods, status <b>symbols,</b> means of communication of identity and aesthetic satisfaction. Our research topics concern: firstly, a theoretical discussion on the evolution of fashion, which has moved from a top-down model (as envisaged by the class-conscious approach of Simmel) to a bottom-up model, as described in the post-modernist approach by Lipovetsky; secondly, a theoretical reflection on the business model adopted by firms to deal with the issue of designing new products, which is often related to the building of external-to-the-firm creative networks; thirdly, a theoretical discussion on the model of an industrial district, seen here as an efficient organizational tool very efficient to deal with the circulation and external absorption of knowledge and fashion trend information. District firms, using a multiplicity of fashion sources, are able to increase their probability of selecting the winning fashion trends, and to reduce their probability of ‘‘not-knowing’’ the winning fashion trends. We present some empirical evidence showing that a complex governance of several fashion sources is required to intercept fashion trends. Fashion emerges in a chaotic environment, as a bottom-up recursive process, partially controlled by fashion firms that scan external information sources and build some interpretative/creative capability developed together with external-to-thefirm agents. Our work uses some empirical data collected through a survey based in the industrial district of Montebelluna, localized in northern Italy, in Treviso. In Montebelluna, several important international producers of sport shoes and sport items are located.
