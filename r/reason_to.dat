5|$|Another peace {{agreement}} between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans lasted until 1552, when Suleiman decided to attack Eger. The siege proved futile, and the Habsburg victory reversed a period of territorial losses in Hungary.

However, although {{the campaign was}} initially boosted by a £1,000 donation from Octavia Hill, fundraising was slow, and by October 1898 only £2,000 had been raised.

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{scientists}} {{generally recognized}} that the number of neurons in the adult brain (roughly 100 billion) did not increase significantly with age, giving neurobiologists good <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe that memories were generally not the result of new neuron production.

40|$|Morality seems important, in {{the sense}} that there are {{practical}} reasons — at least for most of us, most of the time — to be moral. A central theoretical motivation for consequentialism is that it appears clear that there are practical <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> promote good outcomes, but mysterious why we should care about non-consequentialist moral considerations or how they could be genuine <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> act. In this paper we argue that this theoretical motivation is mistaken, and that because many arguments for consequentialism rely upon it, the mistake substantially weakens the overall case for consequentialism. We argue that there is indeed a theoretical connection between good states and <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> act, because good states are those it is fitting to desire and there is a conceptual connection between the fittingness of a motive and <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> perform the acts it motivates. But while some of our motives are directed at states, others are directed at acts themselves. We contend that just as the fittingness of desires for states generates <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> promote the good, the fittingness of these act-directed motives generates <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> do other things. Moreover, we argue that an act’s moral status consists in the fittingness of act-directed feelings of obligation to perform or avoid performing it, so the connection between fitting motives and <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> act explains <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> be moral whether or not morality directs us to promote the good. This, we contend, de-mystifies how there could be non-consequentialist reasons that are both moral and practical...|$|R

40|$|This paper employs {{survey data}} on the <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> quit of Dutch job changers who entered or left a public sector job in 2001. We show that workers' <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> quit their public sector job {{influence}} their decision to stay in or leave their industry of employment. A bad experience with, for instance, pay, work pressure, or job duties makes a change in industry more likely. Likewise, many workers who quit out of dissatisfaction with pay or management leave the public sector altogether. Lastly, it is shown that workers' <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> quit fully explain the differences in wage growth between intra- and interindustry job movers.
