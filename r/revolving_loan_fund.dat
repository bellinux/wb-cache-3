40|$|State {{infrastructure}} banks (SIBs) are state-run <b>revolving</b> <b>loan</b> <b>funds</b> {{that offer}} financial assistance for transportation projects mainly through low-interest loans. This study examines {{the role of}} SIBs in transportation finance by investigating {{the extent to which}} SIBs provide lower cost borrowing than would be available through the municipal bond market. The authors use a two-step research approach: developing a predictive model to estimate the interest rate for the non-SIB financing alternative of municipal bond financing and then calculating the differential interest rate between SIB loans and municipal bonds. The authors also explore the impact of SIB goals, project type, state aid, and stateâ€”local equity {{on the size of the}} interest rate savings. The authors find that SIB loan interest rates are lower than those of comparable municipal bonds; the size of this interest rate savings is influenced by the SIB goals and stateâ€”local equity concerns. state infrastructure bank; transportation finance; innovative finance; borrowing costs; <b>revolving</b> <b>loan</b> <b>funds...</b>|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few years <b>revolving</b> green <b>loan</b> <b>funds</b> have been {{implemented}} at about fifty schools all across the country to help fund sustainability projects on their campus. These green revolving funds are used to invest in sustainability projects that lower operating expenses, for example, energy bills. The savings that these projects produce then get sent back to the fund and are reinvested in additional projects. These <b>loan</b> <b>funds</b> have been incredibly helpful in furthering the sustainability goals of colleges, while also helping to save the universities money. My research included looking into how other universities are implementing these <b>revolving</b> <b>loan</b> <b>funds,</b> with a focus on universities in our peer group, to determine how Southern Illinois University can best implement one of these funds on our campus. I also spoke to stakeholders on campus to find out their ideas or opinions on the fund.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of the energy policy of the Black Sea countries has been the provision of required energy on a timely, reliable, cost-effective, and high-quality basis {{in order to support}} sustainable development and social progress. The policy also makes notable efforts to ensure adequate funding and encouragement of investments from the public and private sector as well as from foreign capital. However, the efficient realization of energy projects depends greatly on adequate and timely identification of possible sources and tools of funding. Lack of public funds and the difficulties in obtaining financing are strong deterrents to energy investments in many countries around the world, and more specifically in economies under transition. Alternative financial mechanisms have been developed to overcome these barriers. This article appraises four financial mechanisms - third-party financing, build-operate-transfer, venture capital, and <b>revolving</b> <b>loan</b> <b>funds</b> - according to the priorities of the energy sector of the Black Sea countries...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated framework for financing and implementing small-scale (<$ 1 M USD) energy efficiency {{projects in the}} transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE). Central themes of this framework are to: • Reduce the time, cost, and expertise needed to prepare the underlying technical and financial assessments, and business plans. • Establish a <b>revolving</b> <b>loan</b> <b>fund(s)</b> to service qualified projects at acceptable rates. The basic process of qualifying and selecting small-scale projects is little {{different from that of}} traditional financing, but the unique feature proposed is to simplify and streamline the procedures so that smaller projects become cost-effective on their own or at reduced levels of bundling. This is accomplished while maintaining acceptable levels of the associated technical, financial, and implementation risks that relate to loan repayment. A major benefit would be the availability of finance to small to medium-size private and municipal sector projects. In addition, a streamlined investment process targeting small-scale energy efficiency projects would promote economic development, environmental improvement, and improved living conditions in the transition economies...|$|R
