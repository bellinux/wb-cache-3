The luminaire directs the light obliquely over the desk, with the highest illuminance typically about 1' to 1½' to the side of the lamp head. It mostly has an arm system that holds the lamp head horizontally irrespective of the arm movement - a parallel arm. Asymmetric lamps often cause more <b>reflected</b> <b>glare</b> than other lamps. In workplaces where people use different table heights, an asymmetric lamp may cause direct glare due to its absence of means for glare control (ref:1).|$|E

50|$|Lenses {{of fixed}} tint are graded {{according}} to the optical density of the tint; in the UK sunglasses must be labelled and show the filter category number. Lenses with light transmission less than 75% are unsuitable for night driving, and lenses with light transmission less than 8% (category 4) are unsuitable for driving at any time; they should by UK law be labelled 'Not suitable for driving and road use'. Yellow tinted lenses are also not recommended for night use. Due to the light levels within the car, filter category 2 lenses which transmit between 18% and 43% of light are recommended for daytime driving. Polarised lenses normally have a fixed tint, and can reduce <b>reflected</b> <b>glare</b> more than non-polarised lenses of the same density, particularly on wet roads.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to above applications, some other designs of the channels and {{applications of the}} liquid colour-changing lenses can also be implemented. For example, when applied on the rearview mirror of cars, they can decrease {{the intensity of the}} <b>reflected</b> light, reduce <b>glare</b> effects and comfort driver’s eyes by the colour liquids filled with. When applied on windows of cars, airplanes or rooms, they can reduce the transmitting intensity of light and prevent human privacy automatically or under one’s control.|$|R
60|$|The earth {{on which}} she was lying {{projected}} like a cape into the river. Quite close to her was a brimming lake of dammed-up water, from which these warm rivulets and torrents were trickling. Wisps of vapour came into circling existence {{a foot or so}} from its mirror-surface. Near at hand and reflected exactly in the water was the upper part of a familiar-looking stone pillar. On the side of her away from the water the heaped ruins rose steeply in a confused slope up to a glaring crest. Above and <b>reflecting</b> this <b>glare</b> towered pillowed masses of steam rolling swiftly upward to the zenith. It was from this crest that the livid glow that lit the world about her proceeded, and slowly her mind connected this mound with the vanished buildings of the War Control.|$|R

She put her hand in his, and thus they went on, to a place where the <b>reflected</b> sun <b>glared</b> up from the river, under a bridge, with a molten-metallic glow that dazzled their eyes, though the sun itself was hidden by the bridge. They stood still, whereupon little furred and feathered heads popped up from the smooth surface of the water; but, finding that the disturbing presences had paused, and not passed by, they disappeared again. Upon this river-brink they lingered till the fog began to close round them--which was very early in the evening {{at this time of the}} year--settling on the lashes of her eyes, where it rested like crystals, and on his brows and hair.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the {{usability}} of using polarized filters for reading lamp to reduce disturbing <b>reflected</b> <b>glare</b> was tested {{based on a}} within-subject design ergonomic research. Results show that with the increasing polarization degree the subjective rating score decreases, which means that increasing polarization of the optical film reduces the <b>reflected</b> <b>glare.</b> Statistical analysis shows that there is high correlation (0. 05 level, 2 -tailed) between the subjective rating score on <b>reflected</b> <b>glare</b> {{and the degree of}} polarization. An univariate analysis of variance proves that the different evaluation caused by the optical films with different polarization degrees has statistically significant meaning (F= 108. 4, p< 0. 001). The results of this research is very useful for optical design of reading lamp, which occupies a big market in China, affecting the visual comfort of huge numbers of readers, such as students and office people...|$|E

40|$|A {{field survey}} {{was carried out}} to {{evaluate}} lighting conditions of visual display terminal (VDT) workplaces. Measurements were made concerning direct and <b>reflected</b> <b>glare</b> at 834 workplaces, illuminance of work surfaces and luminance characteristics of VDT screens at 659 workplaces. The results indicated that direct glare was present at 18. 9 %, and <b>reflected</b> <b>glare</b> at 32. 1 % of the workplaces surveyed. The illumination levels of work surfaces were between 300 and 1, 000 lx for keyboards or documents and below 500 lx for screens at 62 % of the workplaces. Insufficient illumination level as low as 300 lx on a keyboard or document were founded at 19. 3 % of the workplaces. Correlation analysis of illumination levels revealed that a keyboard illuminance above 750 lx resulted in an excessive vertical illuminance on screen above 5 OO lx. Most screens (73. 8 %) showed a character-background luminance ratio ranging from 3 to 15. Only 13. 8 % of the screens surveyed were, however, above 10 cd/㎡ as to the background luminance. The results of the survey suggested that the narrow space of VDT workrooms was responsible for these inadequate lighting conditions {{which could lead to}} visual fatigue of the operators...|$|E
5|$|In 1841, {{following}} {{suggestions from}} the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of <b>reflected</b> heat and <b>glare</b> from the asphalt surface. The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly. The fountains were fed from two wells, one {{in front of the}} National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel. Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a computer-aided visualization on {{the influence of}} reflected sunbeams from curtain wall buildings. A survey was made to local buildings and it was discovered that <b>reflected</b> <b>glare</b> is a significant urban problem. Based on survey findings, a simulation was conducted to compare with actual occurrences in order to increase the comprehension of the consequences of window orientation and angles in the design stage. The simulation enabled design evaluation with an inspection above normal eye level and in a broader area, than that which normally could be achieved in a site survey at a pedestrian's or a driver's level. The computer simulation verified the influence of reflection on the urban environment by using a time-based record. In order to provide design solutions, the simulation used a 10 x 10 x 10 cube in referencing the horizontal area that would receive reflections. Due to the symmetric shape of the cube, a butterfly shaped boundary of reflection area (BRA) was concluded. BRA is smaller on the summer solstice than on the spring or autumnal equinox. In order to reduce BRA, a passive design approach was applied by tilting or rotating walls to evaluate how the tilted angles or orientation of the façade could affect <b>reflected</b> <b>glare...</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce energy use in {{lighting}} Union Carbide recently issued drastically reduced new lighting level standards. A computerized lighting cost program was also developed. Using this program a number of additional energy saving techniques were identified. Savings in power and cost were quantified for typical examples as follows: Task lighting, high light source efficacy, high luminaire mounting height, efficient luminaires, surroundings painted a light color, regular luminaire cleaning, use of natural light, and turning off lights when not in use. In addition energy can be reduced by {{improving the quality of}} light. This is done through improved contrast, sufficient size of task, minimal direct and <b>reflected</b> <b>glare,</b> and reduced shadows. Visual examples are given...|$|E
40|$|One of the functions, {{fulfilled}} by {{a building}} envelope, is {{the regulation of}} daylight. Daylight control technologies for buildings are important for glare reduction and visual comfort of the occupants. The current technologies provide various solutions to reduce glare, by directing or blocking light. Unfortunately, this is often conflicting with other requirements, like visibility. Therefore, the main objective of this report is to develop an adaptive system, which reduces glare and improves visual comfort in standard office buildings. Biomimicry is a problem solving methodology, inspired by natural strategies. Inspired by {{the eyes of a}} fish, polarization of light will decrease the <b>reflected</b> <b>glare</b> tremendously, without depriving visibility.

5000|$|Light {{reflected}} from a non-metallic surface becomes polarized; {{this effect}} is maximum at Brewster's angle, about 56° from the vertical for common glass. A polarizer rotated to pass only light polarized in the direction perpendicular to the reflected light will absorb much of it. This absorption allows <b>glare</b> <b>reflected</b> from, for example, {{a body of water}} or a road to be reduced. Reflections from shiny surfaces (e.g. vegetation, sweaty skin, water surfaces, glass) are also reduced. This allows the natural color and detail of what is beneath to come through. Reflections from a window into a dark interior can be much reduced, allowing it to be seen through. (The same effects are available for vision by using polarizing sunglasses.) ...|$|R
50|$|Landing {{lights are}} {{typically}} only useful as visibility aids to the pilots when the aircraft {{is very low}} and close to terrain, as during take-off and landing. Landing lights are usually extinguished in cruise flight, especially if atmospheric conditions are likely to make the lights <b>reflect</b> or <b>glare</b> back {{into the eyes of}} the pilots. However, the brightness of landing lights makes them useful for increasing the visibility of an aircraft to other pilots, and so pilots are often encouraged to keep their landing lights on while below certain altitudes or in crowded airspace. Some aircraft (especially business jets) have lights that— when not needed to directly illuminate the ground—can operate in a flashing mode to enhance visibility to other aircraft. One convention is for commercial aircraft to turn on their landing lights when changing flight levels. Landing lights are sometimes used in emergencies to communicate with ground personnel or other aircraft, especially if other means of communication are not available (radio failures and the like). Additionally, landing lights have at times been installed as a vehicle high beam in the hot rod scene, although this is not legal.|$|R
40|$|In {{the world}} of sports, {{especially}} at the professional level, athletes use every advantage they can to remain competitive. Glare from the sun or stadium lights can interfere with performance by reducing contrast between targets of interest and their background, for example, a ball moving through a crowded stadium. Methods to reduce this glare have been developed, and currently the most common is wearing eye-black grease or black adhesive strips (an alternative to the grease) under the eyes. The first evidence of an athlete's use of a dark substance on the cheek is found in a 1942 photograph of Washington Redskins fullback Andy Farkas (1, as cited 2). In that era, players would burn cork and smear the ash on their cheeks. They thought that the dark pigment would absorb light, thereby preventing <b>reflected</b> light (<b>glare)</b> from interfering with their vision. Since then, ingredients have changed, but the concept lives on. There is even a waterproof form of eye black made for surfers called "Glareblox, " though eye black is most commonly worn by baseball or football players (3). Today, eye black is very common and available at nearly every sporting goods store. Recently, {{a different way of}} wearing eye black has emerged. Some players paint their entire faces, sometimes with elaborate designs, perhaps in an effort to intimidate their competition. In the professional leagues this ca...|$|R
40|$|An onsite {{evaluation}} {{was conducted}} at five establishments using VDTs to examine VDT workstation designs and to compare these designs to recommendations obtained from the literature. Measurements were made of such critical design factors as keyboard height, screen height, workstation illumination, and glare. Illumination levels were generally in the 500 to 700 Ix range, and questionnaire data confirmed that these levels were acceptable to most employees. A number of design problems {{were found in the}} VDT workstations, including excessive keyboard heights and screen pos'itioning which would require excessive inclination {{of the head and neck}} for screen viewing. A majority of the operators surveyed found a number of factors to be bothersome, including screen readability, <b>reflected</b> <b>glare,</b> screen brightness, and flicker.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a post-occupancy {{study of the}} lighting environment in a green office. A multiple-tool methodology was developed and tested, which included occupant surveys, interviews, illuminance measurements, sky view analyses by a fisheye-lens camera, examinations of the lighting control scheme, and user behaviour observations. Occupants reported an overall satisfied rating of the lighting environment. The dissatisfaction sources identified were <b>reflected</b> <b>glare</b> from other buildings and lack of individual lighting control. Two design suggestions were generated to inform lighting environmental design. First, effective glare control systems like shadings and thick blinds {{should be considered in}} daylighting design in a compact urban environment; secondly, individual task lights should be adopted to increase occupants’ comfort by enabling them to adjust the workspace to their individual needs. In sum, the tool-kit is proved to be able to identify satisfaction levels and dissatisfaction sources...|$|E

The flat-topped, white houses surrounding the plaza <b>reflected</b> a dazzling <b>glare,</b> and the heat shimmered mercilessly upon the rough paving-stones. Flakes of plaster had fallen from the buildings; a few of them were mere ruins, relics of a past age; for the town had been built when conquistadores from Spain first plunged into the tropic forest to search for El Dorado. Here and there dilapidated green lattices shaded upper windows, and nearer the ground narrow openings were guarded by rusty iron bars; but some of the houses showed blank outer walls, and the plaza had rather an Eastern than an American look. Spain has set upon the New World the stamp the Moors impressed on her.|$|R

40|$|This study {{compared}} the quantitative {{influence of a}} variety of factors on the performance of low-beam headlamps. The factors included were vertical aim, horizontal aim, mounting height, lateral separation, lens dirt, lamp voltage, number of functioning lamps, vehicle type, beam pattern and light source. The following aspects of headlamp performance were considered: visibility of pedestrians, visibility of road delineation, visibility of vehicle reflex reflectors, visibility of rettoreflective traffic signs, visibility of targets near the road expansion point, glare directed towards oncoming drivers, <b>glare</b> <b>reflected</b> from wet pavement towards oncoming drivers, glare directed towards rearview mirrors of preceding vehicles, and foreground illumination. A sales-weighted average US beam pattern, with lamps mounted at sales-weighted average locations, formed the basis for most of the analyses. The results indicate that, from among the factors studied, vertical aim is overwhelmingly {{the most important factor in}} influencing the performance of low-beam headlamps. The second most important factor is the number of functioning lamps. The main implication of this study is that major improvements in current (fixed as opposed to adaptive) low-beam headlighting could be achieved primarily by better control of vertical aim and by use of longer-life headlamps...|$|R
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} assess the capabilities and limitations of the Private Eye, a miniature, head-mounted monitor. The first experiment compared the Private Eye with a cathode ray tube (CRT) and hard copy in both a constrained and unconstrained work envelope. The task was a simulated maintenance and assembly task that required frequent reference to the displayed information. A main effect of presentation media indicated faster placement times using the CRT as compared with hard copy. There {{were no significant differences}} between the Private Eye and either the CRT or hard copy for identification, placement, or total task times. The goal of the second experiment was to determine the effects of various local visual parameters on the ability of the user to accurately perceive the information of the Private Eye. The task was an interactive video game. No significant performance differences were found under either bright or dark ambient illumination environments nor with either visually simple or complex task backgrounds. <b>Glare</b> <b>reflected</b> off of the bezel surrounding the monitor did degrade performance. It was concluded that this head-mounted, miniature monitor could serve a useful role for in situ operations, especially in microgravity environments...|$|R
