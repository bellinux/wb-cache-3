50|$|By June 2013, it was {{announced}} by BSP Governor Amando M. Tetangco, Jr that the country's outstanding external debt registered by the BSP has declined by US$1.0 billion (or 1.8%) to US$58.0 billion from US$59.0 billion in March. According to him, this was largely a result of net loan repayments, mostly by the public sector, as well as negative foreign exchange <b>revaluation</b> <b>adjustments</b> as the US dollar strengthened, particularly against the Japanese Yen. This decrease supported the yearly trend with debt stock reflecting a reduction of US$3.2 billion (or 5.3%) from US$61.2 billion in June 2012.|$|E
50|$|This {{implies that}} FX {{requirements}} for debt payments are well spread out and, thus, more manageable.The {{weighted average maturity}} for all MLT accounts stood at 17.0 years, with public sector borrowings having a longer average tenor of 22.2 years compared to 8.6 years for the private sector. ST external debt comprised the 17.4 percent balance of the debt stock, consisting largely of bank borrowings, intercompany accounts of foreign bank branches, trade credits, and deposits of non-residents.Public sector external debt stood at US$39.1 billion (or 52.0 percent of total debt stock), slightly lower than the US$39.3 billion level (50.7 percent) as of end-2014 due mainly to negative FX <b>revaluation</b> <b>adjustments</b> (US$209 million) as the US Dollar strengthened against most currencies.Private sector debt likewise declined to US$36.2 billion from US$38.3 billion a quarter ago due largely to the net repayments of bank liabilities (US$2.9 billion).|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the role of}} <b>revaluation</b> and <b>adjustment</b> factors in pension systems. The first part sheds light on the determination of <b>revaluation</b> and <b>adjustment</b> factors according to the General Social Security Act (Allgemeines Sozialversicherungsgesetz — ASVG) and how these factors have evolved over time. The analysis shows that since the mid- 1980 s the revaluation factors have been set {{more or less in}} line with the inflation rate; in other words, contributions have not, in fact, been revalued in real terms. The author then demonstrates that such a system eventually conflicts with principles of intragenerational and intergenerational fairness. In such case, the mere extension of the assessment period may entail substantial reductions in pension benefits. When we consider the Austrian situation, extending the assessment period from 15 to 40 years may cause the average pension to drop by 11 % to 36 % (depending on the underlying assumptions). Capping maximum losses at 10 % certainly is a solution for persons aged 35 + at the cutoff date, but anyone younger than that would have to bear the brunt of such a pension reform measure. In the light of the problematic fairness aspects of the current revaluation regime, relating the necessary reform of the Austrian pension system and the concomitant paring of benefits too closely to the effects of this revaluation regime {{does not seem to be}} the right approach. In a new (harmonized) system, the revaluation factors should at any rate be linked to wage growth. The last section of this paper focuses on issues which are crucial in wage-based revaluation regimes and which are mainly related to the emergence of demographic shifts. Some of the questions tackled are: Should revaluation be based on the growth rate of average earnings or of the total wage bill? Is the 80 - 45 - 65 formula frequently cited in the pension reform debate in Austria consistent in itself? Should automatic adjustment factors (sustainability factors) be built into the pension system, and if so, which ones? Does it make any difference then whether we are dealing with a traditional pay-as-you-go pension model or a notional account system?Pension Systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{international}} Investment Position (IPP) is {{a statement}} that shows the value of external financial assets and liabilities of residents of an economy {{at a point in}} time. Its evolution {{at the end of a}} specific period reflects balance of payments financial account transactions, valuation changes (in asset prices and exchange rates) and other adjustments, which consist mainly of reclassifications of external financial assets and liabilities. The purpose of this paper is to provide figures on trends of valuation adjustments due to price and exchange rate changes implicit in Spain´s International Investment Position (IIP), and to briefly analyze their limitations. We found that valuation effects depend on the characteristics of the financial instruments involved, and on the sources of information available for each component. In the case of portfolio investment transactions, we used security by security market prices that were available for the years 2003 and 2004. Additionally, in Spain´s international investment position, most foreign direct investment data are not available at market values. As these assets and liabilities have experienced important price increases between 1993 and 2006, we present a new methodology for measuring foreign direct investment positions that includes valuation effects. The results presented in this paper show that in Spain, revaluations of stocks explain a very important part of changes in the IIP during recent years: 55 % of the increase in the net liability position of the Spanish economy between 1993 and 2004 reflects changes of value due to variations in prices or in exchange rates of external assets and liabilities. Overall, the sum of these revaluation effects represent 19 % of GDP of the year 2004. Between 1997 and 2004, Spain’s net liability position increased 247, 930 million euros, of which balance of payments financial account transactions accounted for 52, 6 %, whereas <b>revaluations</b> and other <b>adjustments</b> explain the remaining 47, 3 %. The latter is broken own into 27, 6 % due to price effects, 10, 1 % to exchange rate changes, and 9, 6 % to other adjustments. ...|$|R
