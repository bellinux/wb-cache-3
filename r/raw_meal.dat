The standard gauge railway that had operated since {{the opening of the}} factory was replaced initially by dump-trucks, before being superseded by conveyor belts.

This kiln produced clinker by the dry process, as opposed to Kilns 1 - 6 which heated the crushed lime and clay as a slurry mixture. Dry process kilns were much more efficient as there was no water to evaporate first. Kiln 7 also featured a Preheater which heated the <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> using the kiln exhaust gases to around 800 Degrees before entering the main Kiln.

Aspergillus niger is evaluated as the only microorganism which meets the requiring that the microorganism can directly release the phosphorus from the <b>raw</b> bone <b>meal</b> of pig and goat, after screened 62 calcium phosphate solubilizing microorganisms from different resources. The main mechanism of A. niger dissolves the <b>raw</b> bone <b>meal</b> is the release of oxalic acid. In liquid media, A. niger dissolved more phosphate from the goat bone than from pig bone. The addition of extra nitrogen to lower the C/N ratio can improve the release of phosphate from goat bone, but no significant increase from pig bone.

The C&D waste which are faced in this research are Recycled Concrete Aggregates (RMA) and Recycled Masonry Aggregates (RMA). According to the target that has set in this dissertation, the planning of the experimental process is focused in three parts. The basic points of each part are ascribed afterwards: a) Characterization of C&D waste, examination of their composition compatibility with the composition of the cement <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> of industrial origin and cement <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> mixtures determination - preparation, b) Burnability study of cement <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> mixtures and c) Preparation of clinkers and Portland cements and examination of their quality characteristics.

40|$|Calcium looping is a {{promising}} post-combustion technology for capturing CO 2 from flue gases by using solid CaO-based sorbents (e. g. limestone). It {{is based on}} a dual fluidized bed (DFB) system that involves a carbonator - where flue gas is absorbed by CaO - and a regenerator where captured CO 2 is enriched to be processed and stored. The potential reuse of spent – from repeated cycles - CaO in cement <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> is among the advantages of the technology. This could allow substantial CO 2 savings in an industry that thrives for decarbonisation. In this study, purged CaO – taken from a 200 KWth DFB pilot facility in the University of Stuttgart - was used in <b>raw</b> <b>meal.</b> The aim was to evaluate if clinker (thus cement and concrete) of acceptable quality can be produced and if any bottlenecks exist. Purged CaO was found chemically compatible with <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> and can replace all limestone in the mix without altering the quality targets. Its elevated SO 3 content (approx. 2 %) however allows for approximately. 10 % addition or else clogging phenomena can occur in the preheater. Practically to allow complete limestone replacement and avoid undesired process implications – in kiln systems with no by-pass installed - SO 3 of the purged sorbent must be kept up to 0. 3 %. Trace elements were found very low, posing no concern for clinker or emissions. Sulphur was in the form of anhydrite, thus it is not expected to give rise to SOx emissions. Burnability of <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> was improved and clinker quality was found similar to the reference case.

Results of the study showed among others that final live weight and daily feed intake were depressed above 50 % level of soyabean <b>meal</b> replacement with <b>raw</b> sorrel seed <b>meal</b> in the diets. <b>Raw</b> sorrel seed <b>meal</b> can therefore replace soyabean meal upto 50 % without adverse effect on broiler performance...|$|R
40|$|The cement {{industry}} has {{for some time}} been seeking alternative raw material for the Portland cement clinker production. The aim {{of this research was}} to investigate the possibility of utilizing iron ore tailings (IOT) to replace clay as alumina-silicate raw material for the production of Portland cement clinker. For this purpose, two kinds of clinkers were prepared: one was prepared by IOT; the other was prepared by clay as a reference. The reactivity and burnability of <b>raw</b> <b>meal,</b> mineralogical composition and physical properties of clinker, and hydration characteristic of cement were studied by burnability analysis, differential thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, and hydration analysis. The results showed that the <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> containing IOT had higher reactivity and burnability than the <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> containing clay, and the use of IOT did not affect the formation of characteristic mineralogical phases of Portland cement clinker. Furthermore, the physical and mechanical performance of two cement clinkers were similar. In addition, the use of IOT was found to improve the grindability of clinker and lower the hydration heat of Portland cement. These findings suggest that IOT can replace the clay as alumina-silicate raw material for the preparation of Portland cement clinker...|$|E
40|$|In {{connection}} with {{the design of a}} new preheater for the application in the cement manufacturing plant which does not use a cyclone tower, particle beds may be formed inside the equipment when <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> is heated up to approximately 850 ºC. Experiences and equipment design from the industry show that congested particles that cause blockages are often occurring, especially at temperatures above 600 ºC – 700 ºC. For this reason, the study of the flow properties of the <b>raw</b> <b>meal,</b> so that the design of the new preheater can ensure a correct operation, is highly important. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to study which parameters affect the flow properties of the bulk solids and, more specifically, to experimentally determine the dependence of the <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> flow properties with the temperature using different testing methods carried out at temperatures up to 850 ºC, which needed to be previously designed and developed. The methods used for the flowability characterization were the uniaxial shear test, the rheological shear test and the poured angle of repose measurement. Precisely, the rheological shear test was an innovation on this thesis, since until the date a rheometer had not been used with this purpose. The results obtained with the flowability testing methods concluded that the <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> flow behavior is kept nearly constant until a temperature around 700 ºC, and from that temperature onwards an increase of the cohesion is achieved, decreasing is flowability. This results matched with another results obtained with coal fly ash found in the literature. Besides, in terms of the effectiveness and reliability of the methods, the uniaxial shear test and the rheological shear test seemed to be fairly adequate for the particle characterization at high temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of CaO and P 2 O 5 upon the reactivity of cement <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> {{was investigated in}} this paper. Ash of bone meal containing Ca 3 (PO 4) 2 - 3 CaO·P 2 O 5 {{was used as the}} source of P 2 O 5. Two series of samples with different content of the ash of bone meal were prepared. In the first series, the ash of bone was added into cement <b>raw</b> <b>meal.</b> The second series of samples were prepared by considering ash as one of CaO sources. Therefore, the total content of CaO in cement <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> was kept constant, while the amount of P 2 O 5 increased. These different series of samples were investigated by analyzing free lime content in the clinkers. The XRD analysis and Electron Micro Probe Analyzer analysis of the clinkers were also carried out. Two parameters were used to characterize the reactivity of cement raw meal: content of free lime and Burnability Index (BI) calculated from free lime content in both series of samples burnt at 1350 ºC, 1400 ºC, 1450 ºC and 1500 ºC. According to the first parameter, P 2 O 5 content that drastically makes worse the reactivity of cement <b>raw</b> <b>meal</b> was found at 1. 11 wt. % in the first series, while this limit has reached 1. 52 wt. % in the second one. According to the BI, the limit of P 2 O 5 was found at 1. 42 wt. % in the first series and 1, 61 wt. % in the second one. Furthermore, EPMA has demonstrated the presence of P 2 O 5 in both calcium silicate phases forming thus solid solutions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{method for}} the {{detoxification}} of commercial deoiled linseed meal was stan-dardized that involved water boiling of powdered meal and subsequent removal of water solubles by centrifugation. The hot-air dried sludge was evaluated for its possible {{use as a}} protein sup-plement in broiler chick rations. Growth studies of chicks showed that water-boiled linseed meal at 50 % protein replacement level was superior to, and at 75 % protein replacement level was on par with, the control diet based on expeller pressed groundnut cake. <b>Raw</b> linseed <b>meal</b> at 20 % protein replacement level was significantly inferior. Chicks fed on processed linseed meal showed no gross histopathological and biochemical changes. Increased weight of the heart, lungs, pancreas, liver, kidney, brain and adrenals, higher serum globulin content, and a marked accumulation of cysta-thione in kidney, liver, and brain were observed in chicks fed <b>raw</b> linseed <b>meal.</b> (Key words. - linseed meal, detoxification, free amino acids, broiler rations...|$|R
40|$|Although {{concrete}} is {{a durable}} material, {{it has a}} big impact on the environment due to its high production volumes. This impact is mostly related to the consumption of virgin raw materials, the production of waste and the emission of carbon dioxide. To optimize the recycling opportunities of concrete, Completely Recyclable Concrete is designed as a raw material for clinker production, without the need for ingredient adjustments. However, CRC concrete constructions may be exposed to environments rich in chlorides, sulphates and other ions, affecting the clinkering process of CRC rubble. Therefore, {{it is important to know}} the effect of these ions on the mineralogy of CRC clinker. In this study the effect of sulphate additions to CRC <b>raw</b> <b>meals</b> on the final clinker mineralogy was studied by XRD/Rietveld analysis. It was found that an increasing sulphate content stimulates the formation of CaO containing sulphates such as calcium langbeinite and anhydrite. Additionally SO 3 was found to stabilize belite at the expense of alite...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the effects of feeding <b>raw</b> kapok seed <b>meal</b> on growth performance, nutrient digestibility and carcass characteristics of weaner rabbits. Thirty (30) weaner rabbits {{were used for the}} study. Five diets were compounded using <b>raw</b> kapok seed <b>meal</b> (RKSM) at 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 % inclusion levels. The rabbits were weighed and randomly assigned to the five dietary treatments replicated three times with two rabbits per replicate in a completely randomized design. The proximate composition of <b>raw</b> kapok seed <b>meal</b> showed it contains 89. 51 % dry matter, 17. 45 % crude fibre, 22. 59 %, crude protein, 10. 05 % ether extracts, 6. 53 %, ash and 43. 38 % nitrogen free extract. The seed meal also contains tannin (2. 53 %), Alkaloid (3. 34 %), phenol (2. 48 %), flavonoid (2. 95 %), saponin (1. 30 %), trypsin inhibitors (17. 97 %), hemagglutinin (1. 69 %) and total oxalate (1. 12 %). The result of growth performance and nutrient digestibility decreased significantly (P< 0. 01) as the dietary levels of <b>raw</b> kapok seed <b>meal</b> increases. Similarly carcass and internal organ weights were significantly influenced by the dietary levels of RKSM. The relative weights of liver, lungs and kidney significantly (P< 0. 01) increased beyond 15 % RKSM inclusion in the diet. It was concluded that RKSM can be fed to weaner rabbit up to 10 % inclusion levels without any adverse effect on the rabbit performance...|$|R
