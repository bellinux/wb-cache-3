40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{the behavior of}} two agents who {{need to make a}} joint decision but they have conflicting preferences about the choice of the outcome. Conventionally such problem is considered as the bargaining problem described as the situation of dividing a pie. But we introduce the model that sheds a different light on the problem in question. The problem is described as the conflict situation modelled as a two-stage game. In the first stage players propose outcomes. The settlement is made if the proposed outcomes are the same. If not, the game moves onto the second stage where they play the concession game called the escalation game. In the escalation game, each player, in turn, has the choice between either to submit by accepting the other’s demand or to escalate by way of insisting his demand to be accepted. Each escalation generates a probability of an inefficient outcome. There are two main findings: (1) it is shown that the player’s decision is determined by his <b>risk</b> <b>limit</b> which measures his intensity towards winning. (2) if the escalation game allocates the demand of the player with the highest <b>risk</b> <b>limit,</b> then players propose the Nash cooperative solution.

Moreover, while EMH predicts that all price movement (in the absence of change in fundamental information) is random (i.e., non-trending), many studies have shown a marked tendency for the stock market to trend over time periods of weeks or longer. Various explanations for such large and apparently non-random price movements have been promulgated. For instance, some research has shown that changes in estimated risk, and the use of certain strategies, such as stop-loss limits and value at <b>risk</b> <b>limits,</b> theoretically could cause financial markets to overreact. But the best explanation seems to be that the distribution of stock market prices is non-Gaussian (in which case EMH, in any of its current forms, would not be strictly applicable).|$|E

These revised <b>risk</b> <b>limits</b> represent the result of the technical evaluation of the first series of Dutch Intervention Values for soil and groundwater. This report presents information on what the main causes of the differences between these <b>risk</b> <b>limits</b> and the current Intervention Values for soil/sediment and groundwater are, how firm the revised <b>risk</b> <b>limits</b> are and what future developments will probably have an impact on the newly derived values. The main reasons for revising the ecotoxicologically based <b>risk</b> <b>limits</b> for soil are: more ecotoxicological data, use of equilibrium-partitioning in the case of little data availability; differences in data evaluation and derivation of separate (instead of summed) values per compound. The main reasons for revising the human toxicologically based <b>risk</b> <b>limits</b> for soil are: revised human-toxicological Maximum Permissible Risk levels, modifications of the model concepts for human exposure modelling and revised input parameters for substances (e. g. Kow, Koc, vapour pressure). How firm ecotoxicological <b>risk</b> <b>limits</b> are largely depends on the amount (and quality) of available toxicity data, the possibility of new data becoming available in the near future and developments in the risk assessment methodology. New data are not expected in large numbers. The firmness of the human-toxicological <b>risk</b> <b>limits</b> also depends on the quality of the data, the possibility of new data becoming available, the basis of and new insights into modelling human exposure and the distribution of data in the input parameters. The uncertainty of the derived <b>risk</b> <b>limits</b> depends, for many compounds, partly on the Koc. The differences between the recommendations of the Technical Soil Protection Committee (TCB) on derivation of intervention values and the derivation of <b>risk</b> <b>limits</b> for underpinning Intervention Values are very limited and clarified. Developments in both the ecotoxicological and human-toxicological risk assessment that could have an impact on the methodology and derived values are identified. No directly applicable results are expected from ecotoxicological developments in the short term. With respect to human risk assessment, some results can be expected on the bioavailability of soil contaminants in the human body and uptake of contaminants in crops. Furthermore, it is recommended to encourage implementing of some developments in risk assessment in the longer term (e. g. generating more toxicological data and stimulating implementation of bioavailability in soil quality objectives) ...|$|E

Surprisingly, even if ballots are known to be missing from the manifest, {{it is not necessary to}} make worst-case assumptions about those ballots [...] for instance, to adjust the margin by the number of missing ballots [...] to ensure that the audit remains conservative.

The modification [...] phantoms to evil zombies (~ 2 EZ) [...] requires only an upper bound on the total number of ballots cast. ~ 2 EZ makes the audit P-value stochastically larger than it would be had the manifest been accurate, automatically requiring more than enough ballots to be audited to offset the manifest errors.
