5000|$|Towada-Minami Station is <b>reversal</b> <b>station</b> with {{a single}} island {{platform}} serving traffic on a switchback. The station has a Midori no Madoguchi staffed ticket office.|$|E
50|$|San Francisco International Airport {{station is}} a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) <b>reversal</b> <b>station</b> on the Pittsburg/Bay Point-SFO/Millbrae line located inside the San Francisco International Airport, {{also known as}} SFO or SFIA.|$|E
50|$|Since Kilkenny is a stub <b>station,</b> <b>reversal</b> is necessary. Non Passenger trains {{such as the}} DFDS Freight {{train from}} Ballina - Waterford avoid Kilkenny by using Lavistown loop which joins both lines going into Kilkenny.|$|R
500|$|... station {{had opened}} in May 1842. Following {{the opening of}} the branch to Tunbridge Wells in 1845, it was renamed Tunbridge Junction in January 1852. The {{original}} station stood to the east of the road bridge, whereas the current station, opened in 1864, stands to the west. Trains leaving Tunbridge had to reverse to reach Tunbridge Wells. This arrangement lasted until 1857, when a new section of line was constructed enabling trains to reach the Hastings line without <b>reversal.</b> The <b>station</b> is [...] from [...] via [...]|$|R
50|$|<b>Reversal</b> at the <b>station</b> {{have been}} carried out using {{automatic}} train operation since June 2008. Platform screen doors were installed to protect passengers from falling under driverless trains. It was the first station on the metro to be so equipped, except on Line 14, which was built for automatic operations at its inception. A rubber-tired tramway (Line 6) from Châtillon to Vélizy-Villacoublay opened in 2014.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 8,017 persons used the line {{during its first}} month of operations. After {{the opening of the}} Northern Railway in 1873, {{passenger}} trains often continued to go past Monsheim for several decades to Marnheim on the Langmeil-Monsheim railway. In the summer of 1914, the local traffic trains on the Alsenz Valley, instead of running to Kaiserslautern, ran on the Bad Münster-Neustadt route, requiring a <b>reversal</b> in Hochspeyer <b>station.</b>|$|R
50|$|Broom Junction was awkwardly {{laid out}} for the {{dominant}} mineral traffic heading from Northamptonshire towards South Wales, as it required <b>reversal</b> at the <b>station.</b> Engines working through required {{to turn on the}} turntable. On 28 September 1942 a south curve was opened by the LMS enabling direct running without entering Broom station. 0 The SMJR passenger service between Stratford and Broom was closed temporarily on 16 June 1947, and the closure was made final on 23 May 1949.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1890s, seven trains went to Kaiserslautern and six to Neustadt; another train ran between Neustadt and Lambrecht. In {{the summer}} of 1914, the trains on the Alsenz Valley Railway (Alsenztalbahn) ran on the Bad Münster-Neustadt route, {{requiring}} a <b>reversal</b> in Hochspeyer <b>station</b> with the locomotive running around the train, and also stopping in Lambrecht. During the First World War and the inter-war period, local transport was largely limited to the Neustadt-Kaiserslautern route. The number of services was also reduced.|$|R
2500|$|Iarnród Éireann (Irish Rail) {{provides}} rail {{services from}} Dublin to Waterford [...] which pass through Kilkenny MacDonagh Station in Kilkenny and Thomastown railway station. Waterford railway station is located just outside County Kilkenny. The stations served are Dublin Heuston, Newbridge, Kildare, Athy, Carlow, Muine Bheag (Bagenalstown), Kilkenny, Thomastown, Waterford Plunkett. Since Kilkenny is a stub <b>station,</b> <b>reversal</b> is necessary. Non Passenger trains {{such as the}} DFDS Freight train from Ballina - Waterford avoid Kilkenny by using Lavistown loop which joins both lines going into Kilkenny. All direct services are operated by 22000 railcars. There is a service every 2 hours.|$|R
5000|$|The {{construction}} of the Rügen embankment in 1936 involved some re{{construction of}} the Angermünde-Stralsund line. In Stralsund, a new signal box was built, the tracks of Stralsund freight yard were extended and a single-track curve, the so-called [...] "Berlin curve", was built to the Angermünde-Stralsund line, so that the <b>reversal</b> in Stralsund <b>station</b> could be avoided, especially for freight trains. At {{the same time the}} line was upgraded to allow higher speeds. The speed limit was raised from 100 km/h along the entire route to 120 km/h on the Angermünde-Ducherow section (and continuing on the branch to Heringsdorf) and 110 km/h on the Ducherow-Stralsund section.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} opened by the Great Western Railway on 30 March 1908, as Cheltenham Malvern Road. It was {{provided}} so that trains {{along the line}} to [...] {{would not have to}} start and terminate at , which involved a <b>reversal.</b> The <b>station</b> took its name from the road to the north from which a long driveway provided the main means of public access. Unlike the other stations on the line, Malvern Road had a single island platform, 860 ft long on the Up side and 702 ft on the Down side, which was reached by means of a covered footbridge leading from the booking office. The platform served both main running lines, together with a bay at the north end into which local branch railmotor services to and from [...] reversed before returning to the St. James terminus, which was much closer to Cheltenham town centre. Malvern Road did not have a resident stationmaster, and it was placed under the responsibility of the St. James stationmaster who also took charge of [...] and [...] stations. Stone from the Cleeve Hill quarries was used in the station buildings, while the platform copings were sourced from Pontypridd.|$|R
50|$|Eastgate {{station was}} closed on 1 December 1975, {{along with the}} Tuffley Loop. This was partly an attempt by British Rail to cut {{maintenance}} costs and partly a result of pressure from the road lobby and local councillors who wanted to rid Gloucester of four of its level crossings. Services that had previously called at Eastgate now had to perform a <b>reversal</b> at Central <b>station,</b> an operational inconvenience {{that has led to}} fewer trains calling at Gloucester. As the rebuilt Gloucester Central station was not completed until 1977, the administrative offices on Eastgate station lingered on in use for nearly two more years until demolition came in 1977. The site is now an Asda supermarket. Only a very few traces of the former Tuffley Loop can now be found.|$|R
50|$|The {{connection}} was opened on 15 October 1879. It amounted to {{an extension of}} the Würzbach Railway (Schwarzenacker-St. Ingbert), which had been completed in 1866 and 1867 and branched off the Homburg-Zweibrücken railway. Its main purpose was to provide a connection for coal trains from the Saarbrücken area to the South Palatinate Railway (Südpfalzstrecke; Landau-Zweibrücken), which opened in 1875, to avoid the detour via Neunkirchen and Bexbach and a <b>reversal</b> in Homburg <b>station.</b> In this way the route used for transport of coal was shortened and the costs were reduced. The same thing applied to products from industrial towns such as Dillingen and Saarlouis, as well as from neighbouring Lorraine (then German Lothringen). In addition, this resulted in a shorter connection between Homburg and Saarbrücken than the previous route via Bexbach and Neunkirchen.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1868, {{together}} with the Köln-Mülheim-Bergisch Gladbach line. In 1870, a line was built from the entrance of Bergisch Gladbach station to Bensberg, requiring trains running to Bensberg to reverse in the station. Due to the increased size of the station a signal box was opened in 1890 at the station entrance on the island between the line to Köln-Mülheim, the line to Bensberg and the Tannenbergstraße level crossing. From 1912 until 1960 there was a connecting curve at Gronau junction so that <b>reversal</b> at the <b>station</b> could be avoided. During {{the establishment of the}} Rhine-Sieg S-Bahn, the Sülz Valley Railway between Köln-Mülheim and Bergisch Gladbach was electrified in 1974-75. Electrification in Bergisch Gladbach station itself, however, was limited to the track serving S-Bahn platform and one other track, which has since been closed.|$|R
50|$|The Gujarat Sampark Kranti Express runs {{three days}} a week. As of 1 November 2009, 2917 departs ADI every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 1720 and arrives at NZM at 1040 on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday, {{averaging}} 65 km/h speed during its run. 2918 departs NZM every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at 1405 and arrives at ADI at 630 on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, averaging 69 km/h speed. In its journey, the train passes through the Indian states of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Delhi. Some cities where the Gujarat Sampark Kranti Express halts en route are Anand, Vadodara, Dahod, Ratlam, Kota and Mathura. The entire route of the train is on double-line electrified track section of Indian Railways. The train experiences a <b>reversal</b> at Vadodara <b>station</b> and the locomotive hauling it is brought {{around to the other}} end of the train to take it towards Ahmedabad or Delhi.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1914, the trains on the Alsenz Valley Railway (Alsenztalbahn) ran on the Bad Münster-Neustadt route, {{requiring}} a <b>reversal</b> in Hochspeyer <b>station</b> with the locomotive running around the train, and also stopping in Frankenstein. During the First World War and the inter-war period, local transport was largely limited to the Neustadt-Kaiserslautern route. In {{the middle of the}} Second World War, most local services on the Mannheim-Saarbrücken railway ran only on sections of the line. As a rule, they ran as far west as Homburg at the most. In the post-war period, services were largely limited to the Neustadt-Kaiserslautern section. From 1991, trains on the Trier-Offenburg route stopped at all stations to the east of Kaiserslautern and thus also in Frankenstein. A few years later the Homburg-Neckarelz route was added, continuing to Osterburken or Heilbronn. From 2001 onwards the trains that previously ran to Offenburg, largely ran only as far as Karlsruhe.|$|R
