Southern also proposed that, following the changes to the door operation, that conductors would now take on an [...] "on-board supervisor role", which would enable conductors {{to be able to}} concentrate on the passengers more as opposed to the doors, but the RMT and ASLEF union described this as an attempt to make conductors unnecessary, and would also be unsafe. However, the rail safety regulator, the Rail Safety and Standards Board, said that [...] "We have 30 years of data which we have analysed.

[...] The BBC suggested that the RMT union are particularly worried about the new method of operation because if drivers, rather than conductors, control the doors then trains could run without conductors and any strike by conductors would not have the power to cancel trains. As a result of this, the RMT and Aslef unions went on strike over the changes, causing severe disruption to Southern services.|$|E

The results indicated that the flow in the tunnels is dominated by a strong background flow that is independent of the train movement but that the flow structure in the main interchange station in the system was found to be very complicated with stratification and flow reversals being observed. The impact of the ventilation system on the natural airflow indicates a lack of understanding of subway climatology when the system was constructed. It is considered that a full and extensive monitoring of the entire subway system be undertaken over a prolonged period to facilitate a full understanding of the airflow and its interaction with the over ground climate.

40|$|Traffic related air {{pollution}} {{is one of}} major environmental issues in densely populated urban areas including Hong Kong. A series of control measures has been implemented by Hong Kong government to cut traffic related air pollutants, including retrofitting the Euro II and Euro III buses with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) devices to lower nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) emissions. In order to reveal the real-life roadside air quality and {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the control measures, this study first analyzed the recent six-year data regarding concentrations of pollutants typically associated with traffic recorded in two governmental roadside monitoring stations and second conducted on-site measurements of concentration of pollutants at pedestrian level near five selected roads. Given that there is a possibility of ammonia leakage as a secondary pollutant from SCR devices, a special attention was paid to the measurements of ammonia level in bus stations and along roadsides. Important influencing factors, such as traffic intensity, street configuration and season, were analyzed. Control measures implemented by the government are effective to decrease the traffic emissions. In 2014, only NO 2 cannot achieve the annual air quality objective of Hong Kong. However, it is important to find that particulate matters, rather than NO 2, post potentially a short-term exposure <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers</b> and pedestrians.

At the time (and to a certain extent also today) one of the most cited arguments against one-man operation was the safety <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers</b> and bystanders if the driver fell ill. The dead man switch ensured that the tram would stop in the event of an incapacitated driver. For this reason, the Birneys were also called [...] "safety cars". Another critical feature of the Birney in dealing with safety issues from the critics of one-man operation was its compact size which eased the drivers view of the road and reducing the number of doors to a single one.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} terrorist threats and illegal proliferation of nuclear material and technology, {{there is a}} need for increased research in the area of detection of smuggled fissile material, some of which is designated by the International Atomic Energy Agency as special fissile material. This thesis focuses on a hypothetical scenario in which a terrorist organization has managed to smuggle an amount of special fissile material onto a personal recreational watercraft and sail it into a marina. If the boat could be forced to go through a detector system, then the contents could be interrogated and a determination made of whether any special fissile material was aboard. This thesis examines the hypothesis that active interrogation may be used successfully in the detection of special fissile material in such an environment. It shows that it is feasible to use an active neutron system to detect a significant quantity of special fissile material onboard a small boat via the differential dieaway technique. The MCNP Monte Carlo transport code was used to simulate the use of a pulsed neutron generator to induce fission in the fissile material and then estimate the detector response. The detector modeled was based on elastic scattering-induced recoil protons using pure hydrogen gas. There was a significant difference between the system with and without the presence of fissile material, and the estimated detector response for the system with fissile material present was shown to be sufficiently greater than the response due to background radiation only. Additionally, dose was estimated and found to be small enough that the system would not likely pose a significant radiological health <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers</b> on the boat...|$|E
40|$|Waiting for {{copyright}} {{information from}} publisherThe Safety Risk Model (SRM) {{is a key}} source of information for the GB rail industry. It is a structured representation of the 120 hazardous events {{that can lead to}} injury or death during the operation of the railway and is used to estimate the <b>risk</b> <b>to</b> <b>passengers,</b> workers and third parties. The SRM includes both rare but high consequence events such as train collisions and more frequent but lower consequence events such as passenger accidents at stations. In aggregate, these lower consequence events make an important contribution to the overall risk, which is measured by a weighted sum of injuries of different severity. Where possible, the SRM is derived from historical incident data, but the derivation of the model parameters still present challenges, which differ for different subsets of events. High consequence events occur rarely so it is necessary to use expert judgement in detailed models of these incidents. In comparison, the low consequence events occur more frequently, but both records of incidents and the models in the SRM are less detailed. The frequency of these low consequence events is sufficient to allow both the absolute risk and trends in the overall risk to be monitored directly. However, without explicit causal factors in the data or the model, the models are less able to support risk management directly, since this requires estimates of the risk reduction possible from particular interventions and control measures. Moreover, such estimates must be made locally, taking account of the local conditions, and at each location even the low consequence events are infrequent. In this paper we describe an approach to modelling the causes of low consequence events in a way that supports the management of risk. We show both how to extract more information from the available data and how to make use of expert judgement about contributory factors. Our approach uses Bayesian networks: we argue their advantages over fault and event trees for modelling incidents that have many contributory causes. Finally, we show how the new approach improves safety management, both by estimating the contribution of the underlying causes to this risk and by predicting how possible management interventions and control measures would reduce this risk...|$|E

The paper presents a case study that investigates how the cooling load discharge from an ECS system affects the flow behaviour inside a typical mid-size, wide-body aircraft passenger cabin. The investigation uses commercial off-the-shelf one dimensional (1 D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software to model the cooling pack, cabin air distribution system, and {{three quarters of the}} passenger cabin. The centre section of the cabin is modelled using a commercial off-the-shelf three dimensional (3 D) CFD package, with the co-simulation middleware providing coupling adapters to ensure that two-way, bilateral exchange of boundary parameters between the 1 D and the 3 D CFD models gives continuity of mass and momentum transfer. The 1 D and 3 D CFD applications and Co-simulation middleware are supplied by 3 independent commercial organisations. The results of the case study are discussed including the co-simulated 'velocity field of the air discharge' and the 'temperature gradient inside the cabin' within the 3 D CFD model as well as the flow and temperature fields within the one-dimensional ECS cooling pack model. The paper concludes by discussing how the proper implementation of the co-simulation methods developed in this case study could bring significant benefits to engineering companies using CFD tools, including improved quality of simulation results and reduced simulation run times...|$|R

40|$|The Overhead Line Equipment (OLE) is a {{critical}} sub-system of the 25 kV AC overhead railway electrification system, which is the main method of railway electrification on the British railway network. OLE failures can result in significant delays and pose <b>risks</b> <b>to</b> <b>passenger</b> safety, therefore, inspection and maintenance is undertaken to improve component reliability and uphold {{the availability of the}} system. OLE asset management strategies can be evaluated using a life cycle cost analysis that considers degradation processes and maintenance activities of the OLE components. The investment required to deliver the level of performance desired by railway customers and regulators can be based on evidence from the analysis’ results. This thesis presents a methodology for modelling the asset management and calculating the whole life cost of the OLE to allow such analysis to take place. This research has developed a High Level Petri net model to simulate the degradation, failure, inspection and maintenance of the main OLE components in a stochastic manner. The model simulates all the main OLE components concurrently in the same model and fixed time interval inspections and condition-based maintenance regimes are considered. The various dependencies between the different components and processes considered, such as opportunistic inspection and maintenance, are also taken into account. The use of High Level Petri nets allows the processes considered to be modelled in a more accurate and efficient manner in comparison to standard Petri nets. The model is used to calculate various statistics associated with the cost, maintenance requirements and reliability of the individual OLE components and the OLE system over its life cycle. This is demonstrated using an example analysis for a 2 -mile section of electrified line, which also describes how the outputs obtained can be used by decision makers to study the performance of the components and the implications of the maintenance strategy evaluated by the model. Finally, a Genetic Algorithm is used in conjunction with the Petri net developed to find the optimum maintenance strategies that result in the lowest total cost of the system.
