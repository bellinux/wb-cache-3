500|$|In late 1987, Slayer {{returned}} to the studio to record their fourth studio album. To contrast the speed of Reign in Blood, the band consciously decided {{to slow down the}} tempos, and incorporate more melodic singing. According to Hanneman, [...] "We knew we couldn't top Reign in Blood, so we had to slow down. We knew whatever we did was gonna be compared to that album, and I <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> actually discussed slowing down. It was weird—we've never done that on an album, before or since." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the atomic}} bombing of Hiroshima, on August 6, 1945, Agnew, along with Alvarez and Johnston, flew as a {{scientific}} observer in The Great Artiste, piloted by Charles Sweeney, which tailed the Enola Gay as the instrumentation aircraft. [...] Agnew later recalled, [...] "After we dropped our gauges I <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> made a sharp turn to the right {{so that we would}} not get caught in the blast – but we still got badly shaken up by it." [...] He brought along a movie camera and took the only existing movies of the Hiroshima event as seen from the air.|$|E

[...] He recalled one of the times they held hands:I <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> went to this club, and I don't go to clubs, which was called the Roxy. And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed. But that means nothing to kids today. She grew up too fast. She wasn't into innocence, and I love that.|$|E

[...] Although [...] "unclubable" [...] reflects Hawkins's relationship with others of Johnson's circle, Johnson and Hawkins had a close friendship as Miss Reynolds describes: [...] "As we were returning from the meadows that day, I <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> met Sir John Hawkins, whom Dr. Johnson seemed much rejoiced to see; and no wonder, for I have often heard him speak of Sir John in terms expressive of great esteem and much cordiality of friendship" [...] Their relationship began around 1739 and they were both involved with The Gentleman's Magazine. Later, Hawkins was, in 1749, a member of Johnson's first club: the Ivy Lane club.|$|E

[...] Oxford's stroke and Olympic bronze medallist Tim Foster told his crew [...] "We'll always <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> lost the Boat Race, but don't forget we are still good rowers." [...] Cadoux-Hudson stated {{in an interview that}} there were two occasions where the blades clashed: [...] "Cambridge were being warned on one occasion and Oxford on the other, so I think it equalled out at the end. I don't think it affected the outcome".|$|E
500|$|In November 2015, {{conductor}} Robert Ziegler, {{who worked}} with Radiohead on The King of Limbs, tweeted photos of the band recording with a string orchestra. The strings and choir sections were arranged by Greenwood and performed by the London Contemporary Orchestra with conductor Hugh Brunt; the orchestra had previously worked with Greenwood on his score for the 2012 film The Master. The strings were recorded at RAK Studios in London. Cellist Oliver Coates said: [...] "Nigel, Jonny and Thom all have this awesome relationship, and were so animated during the recording. I <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> were laying down the cello part {{at the end of}} 'Daydreaming' and Thom said, 'That's it – that is the sound of the record.'" [...] Greenwood had the cellists detune their cellos for the song, creating a [...] "growling" [...] sound. Additional string and choir parts were recorded but cut from the album.|$|E

[...] Volk was responsible for covering Pro Football Hall of Famers Bob Hayes and Mike Ditka in the Super Bowl, and he {{played a key role}} in the Colts' victory. [...] In the fourth quarter, the Colts trailed the Cowboys 136. [...] Volk intercepted a pass by Cowboys quarterback Craig Morton at the Dallas 33-yard line and returned it 30 yards to the 3-yard line to set up the tying touchdown. [...] Baltimore quarterback Earl Morrall later referred to Volk's interception as the play of the game. [...] Interviewed in 2009, Volk cited Super Bowl V as his fondest memory of playing in Baltimore. [...] He recalled team owner Carroll Rosenbloom flying the whole team, families included, to the Bahamas the day after the game: [...] "The next day we all got on the plane and flew over to the Bahamas. He took the whole family – my wife and one kid, at the time. I <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> were on the beach, Tom Mitchell and I, and we got the paper to make sure it was really true - that we did win.

The stallion {{getting ready to go}} is smelling the mares and he's running like a bat out of hell and Linda's behind me saying, 'I'm very nervous about this horse.' And I said, 'Join the club.

I met Frazer at a local Hell gig in Long Eaton and it turned out they were thinking of getting a second guitarist. I heard a tape (which I still have, it's priceless) of a show they did in a pub in Nottingham and decided to have a jam as I was wanting to get some experience playing, after all I was the ripe old age of 15. Hell, two weeks after I joined, the original guitarist quit (i think this was on the cards) and the drummer left (thankfully) after we did our first demo a couple of months later, I think due to me having a go about his girlfriend being in the studio (you see, good work ethic back then!). It was Tim Bowler (the drummer from Hell) who introduced us to Simon Negus. The name Sabbat came from a book on witchcraft, but I actually found some old school books of mine with ideas doodled on them so I'm sure I had some doing in suggesting it, but I do <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> liked the way the word looked in the scrawly type of writing so we went with it.

[...] Lisa said [...] "We go from something like “Sanctified,” which, to be honest, wasn’t written with the idea of being a Veronicas track. That was very much written when I was in Nashville and I was immersing myself in the blues and roots-y, swampy soul singing. Then we were working with Billy Corgan we did a “fuck you” kind of track “Did You Miss Me,” which we rap on, which is a completely different thing. We get poppy with “Cold,” and bring it back to an acoustic song like “You and Me” which could be considered a little bit folk-y, country" [...] " [...] Lisa said [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>we</b> really got into trip hop and decided we were going to make a trip hop album. I then got on a bluesy-rock-swampy-soul kick after we'd spent some time in Nashville. Eventually we came back around to songs like Cruel – the stuff people identify with The Veronicas." [...] In an interview with Stephanie Anderson of BuzzFeed, the duo elaborated on the change from their first two albums, with Jessica saying: [...] "If things were one dimensional on the first and second record, like, we would say exactly how we felt, and it was all just, total passion, we really didn’t overthink it, we just put down what we were feeling, [...] is more, 3D-4D...
