25|$|When a {{cartridge}} is fired, {{the internal}} pressure expands {{the case to}} fit the chamber in a process called obturation. To allow ease of chambering the cartridge when it is reloaded, the case is swaged back to size. Competition shooters, using bolt action rifles {{that are capable of}} camming a tight case into place, often <b>resize</b> only the neck of the cartridge, called neck sizing, as opposed to the normal full length resizing process. Neck sizing is only useful for cartridges to be re-fired in the same firearm, as the brass may be slightly oversized in some dimensions for other chambers, but the precise fit of case to chamber will allow greater consistency and therefore greater potential accuracy. Some believe that neck sizing will permit a larger number of reloads with a given case in contrast to full size resizing, although this is controversial. Semi-automatic rifles and rifles with SAAMI minimum chamber dimensions often require a special small base resizing die, that sizes further down the case than normal dies, and allows for more reliable feeding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Visualization <b>resizing</b> {{is useful}} for many {{applications}} such as collaborative business intelligence where users may use display devices with different sizes and aspect ratios. General <b>resizing</b> techniques (e. g., uniform scaling) and image <b>resizing</b> techniques suffer from several drawbacks, as they do not consider the content of visualizations. In this work, we introduce ViSizer, a perception-based framework for automatically <b>resizing</b> a visualization to fit any display. It can largely preserve salient features while <b>resizing</b> the visualization to an arbitrary aspect ratio with minimum visual clutter introduced. To achieve this, we formulate an energy function based on a perception model (feature congestion), which aims to determine the optimal deformation for every local region. We subsequently transform the <b>resizing</b> problem into a non-linear optimization problem by the energy function. An efficient optimization algorithm is introduced to iteratively solve the problem, allowing for automatic visualization <b>resizing...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for interactive content-aware image <b>resizing.</b> The <b>resizing</b> is performed on warping a triangular mesh over the image, which captures the image saliency information {{as well as the}} underlying image features. The warped triangular mesh and the horizontal and vertical scales of all triangles are simultaneously obtained by a quadratic optimization which can be achieved by solving a sparse linear system. Our approach can preserve the shapes of curved features in the <b>resized</b> images. The <b>resizing</b> operation can be performed in an interactive rate which makes the proposed approach practically useful for realtime image <b>resizing.</b> To guarantee foldover free <b>resizing</b> result, we modify the optimization to a standard quadratic programming. A number of experimental results have shown that our approach has obtained pleasing results and outperforms the previous approaches.

5|$|The {{usefulness}} of inversion {{can be increased}} significantly by <b>resizing.</b> As noted in Viète's reconstruction, the three given circles and the solution circle can be <b>resized</b> in tandem while preserving their tangencies. Thus, the initial Apollonius problem is transformed into another problem that may be easier to solve. For example, the four circles can be <b>resized</b> so that one given circle is shrunk to a point; alternatively, two given circles can often be <b>resized</b> {{so that they are}} tangent to one another. Thirdly, given circles that intersect can be <b>resized</b> so that they become non-intersecting, after which the method for inverting to an annulus can be applied. In all such cases, the solution of the original Apollonius problem is obtained from the solution of the transformed problem by undoing the <b>resizing</b> and inversion.|$|R

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{security}} of a given steganographic algorithm strongly depends on the statistical properties of the cover source. In this paper, we study how downsampling affects steganographic security. The secure payload no longer scales according to the square-root law because <b>resizing</b> changes the statistical properties of the cover source. We demonstrate this experimentally for various types of <b>resizing</b> algorithms and their settings and thoroughly interpret the results. Modeling digital images as Markov chains allows us to compute the Fisher information rate for the simplest <b>resizing</b> algorithm with the box kernel and derive the proper scaling of the secure payload with <b>resizing.</b> The theory fits experimental data, which indicates the existence of a new scaling law expressing the length of secure payload when the cover length is not modified by adding or removing pixels but, instead, by subsampling. Since both steganography and steganalysis is today commonly evaluated through controlled experiments on <b>resized</b> images (e. g., the BOSSbase), the effect of <b>resizing</b> on security is of utmost importance to practitioners.

2500|$|Duckpin bowling is a {{variation}} of bowling that uses balls which are significantly smaller than those used in ten-pin bowling, weighing [...] each, which are devoid of finger holes. The pins are correspondingly shorter and lighter than their ten-pin equivalents. Hence, when the pins are knocked down, they resemble a [...] "flock of flying ducks". While the rules remained almost identical {{to those of the}} Ten-pin game, one rule change was made: A bowler is allowed to use three bowls on each turn. Strikes would still be strikes and spares still spares, but when all pins were knocked down on the third ball, it counts as a score of ten. During the summer of 1900, some bowlers at Diamond Alleys in Baltimore, Maryland thought it might be interesting to <b>resize</b> the pins to match the 6-inch ball. Thus, the inventor of duckpin bowling, John Van Sant, used a wood turner to do exactly that.|$|E

[...] All cast lead bullets, whether with or without a gas check, must still be lubricated, to prevent leading of the rifling of the barrel. [...] A lubricating/resizing press, which is a special purpose bullet processing press, can be either a standalone press dedicated to lubricating and resizing bullets, or can be an add-on to a reloading press, at the option of the handloader. [...] Not all handloaders <b>resize</b> cast lead bullets, although all handloaders do lubricate cast lead bullets.

2500|$|Shotshell presses are {{generally}} a single {{unit of the}} [...] "H" [...] configuration that handles all functions, dedicated to reloading just one gauge of shotshell. Shotshell reloading is similar to cartridge reloading, except that, instead of a bullet, a wad and a measure of shot are used, and after loading the shot, the shell is crimped shut. Both 6 and 8 fold crimps are in use, for paper hulls and plastic hulls, respectively. [...] Likewise, roll crimps are in use for metallic, paper, and plastic hulls. [...] The shotshell loader contains stations to <b>resize</b> the shell, measure powder, load the wad, measure shot, and crimp the shell. Due to the low cost of modern plastic shotshells, and the additional complexity of reloading fired shells, shotshell handloading is not as popular as cartridge handloading. [...] For example, unlike when handloading rifle and pistol cartridges, where all the various components (cases, gas checks, powder, primers, etc.) from different manufacturers are usually all interchangeable, shotshells typically are loaded for particular brands of shotshell cases (called hulls) only with one specific brand of wad, shot cup (if used), primer, and powder, further increasing the complexity and difficulty of reloading shotshells. Substitution of components is not considered safe, as changing just one component, such as a brand of primer, can increase pressures {{by as much as}} 3500 PSI, which may exceed SAAMI pressure limits. [...] Reloading shotshells is therefore more along the lines of precisely following a recipe with non-fungible components. [...] Where shotshell reloading remains popular, however, is for making specialized shotgun shells, such as for providing lowered recoil, when making low-cost [...] "poppers" [...] used for training retrievers before hunting season to acclimate hunting dogs to the sound of a gun firing without actually shooting projectiles, for achieving better shot patterning, or for providing other improvements or features not available in commercially loaded shotshells at any price, such as when handloading obsolete shotshells with brass cases for gauges of shotshells that are no longer commercially manufactured.|$|E

40|$|Hardware {{designers}} are constantly {{looking for ways}} to squeeze waste out of architectures to achieve better power efficiency. Cache <b>resizing</b> is a technique that can remove wasteful power consumption in caches. The idea is to determine the minimum cache a program needs to run at near-peak performance, and then reconfigure the cache to implement this efficient capacity. While there has been significant previous work on cache <b>resizing,</b> existing techniques have focused on controlling <b>resizing</b> for a single level of cache only. This sacrifices significant opportunities for power savings in modern CPU hierarchies which routinely employ 3 levels of cache. This paper investigates multi-level cache <b>resizing</b> (MCR). MCR independently <b>resizes</b> all caches in a modern cache hierarchy to minimize dynamic and static power consumption at all caching levels simultaneously. Specifically, we study a static-optimal version of MCR, and find <b>resizing</b> a 3 -level hierarchy can reduce total energy dissipation by 58. 9 % with only 4. 4 % degradation in performance. Our study shows a non-trivial portion of this gain – 1 3 rd for programs exhibiting good temporal locality–comes from optimizing the interactions between <b>resizing</b> decisions at different caching levels. We also propose several dynamic <b>resizing</b> algorithms that can automatically find good size configurations at runtime. Our results show dynamic MCR can achieve between 40 – 62 % energy savings with slightly higher performance degradation than static-optimal MCR. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—the {{most popular}} image and video {{compression}} {{methods such as}} JPEG, MPEG 1 / 2 / 4, H. 261 / 3 / 4 use transform domain techniques {{and in particular the}} Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). One application for such images or video sequences is <b>resizing.</b> <b>Resizing</b> is extensively used to meet the requirements of a specific system, to satisfy user’s interests, or to correct spatial distortions. However, a major difficulty encountered when <b>resizing</b> such media is the high computational complexity and the loss of quality caused by the decompression and compression. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to implement an arbitrary ratio image <b>resizing</b> scheme in the DCT domain for transcoding of the compressed images. There are several advantages in working in the DCT domain, of these advantages the one that stands out the most is the fact that images are stored in the DCT domain and therefore no initial computation is needed in order to work on the image. The downsizing process in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain can be implemented by truncating high-frequency coefficients, whereas the upsizing process is implemented in the DCT domain by padding zero coefficients to the high-frequency part. The implemented method combines a fast inverse and forward DCT of composite length for arbitrary-ratio upsizing or downsizing. The implemented method shows a good peak signal-to-noise ratio and less computational complexity compared with the spatial-domain and previous DCT-domain image <b>resizing</b> methods. Further it will compare several methods offered by different authors for image <b>resizing.</b> The implemented method of arbitrary ratio image <b>resizing</b> improve peak signal-to-noise ratio and reduces computational complexity when compared with other existing methods. This implemented approach of image <b>resizing</b> is extended for video <b>resizing.</b> The PSNR values of the <b>resized</b> video are calculated by using an existing tool.
