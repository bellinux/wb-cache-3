Its continued deterioration has increased the risk of its <b>radioactive</b> <b>inventory</b> leaking out into the environment. Between 2004 and 2008, workers stabilized the roof and western wall of the shelter. However, construction of the NSC was necessary in order to continue containing the radioactive remains of ChNPP reactor 4. Further upgrades to the area in preparation for NSC construction were completed in 2010 and included road and rail connections, site services (power, water, drains, and communications), facility for workers (also offers medical and radiation protection facilities), and the installation of a long-term monitoring system. It has been estimated that up to 95% of the original <b>radioactive</b> <b>inventory</b> of reactor unit 4 still remains inside the ruins of the reactor building.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{experience}} with AVR, a full scale power station (the thorium high-temperature reactor or THTR-300 rated at 300 MW) was constructed, dedicated to using thorium as the fuel. THTR-300 suffered a number of technical difficulties, and owing to these and political events in Germany, was closed after only four years of operation. One cause for the closing was an accident on 4 May 1986 with a limited release of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>inventory</b> into the environment. Although the radiological impact of this accident remained small, it is of major relevance for PBR history. The release of radioactive dust {{was caused by a}} human error during a blockage of pebbles in a pipe. Trying to restart the pebbles' movement by increasing gas flow led to stirring up of dust, always present in PBRs, which was then released, radioactive and unfiltered, into the environment due to an erroneously open valve.|$|E

To trace the dust and tritium inventory in the machine, the use of collectors in the form of removable samples was evaluated, beside other techniques, since it provides a reliable way to follow the history of the deposits and check critical areas. Four types of removable probes and two optional active diagnostics were selected out of about 30 different options. For all four probes, a conceptual design was worked out and the feasibility was checked with preliminary estimations of thermal and electromagnetic loads, as well as remote handling paths. The highest temperature estimated for the front face of all probes lies in the range 300 – 500 °C, which is tolerable.

40|$|An {{air cargo}} {{inspection}} system combining two nuclear reaction based techniques, namely Fast-Neutron Resonance Radiography and Dual-Discrete-Energy Gamma Radiography {{is currently being}} developed. This system is expected to allow detection of standard and improvised explosives as well as special nuclear materials. An important aspect for the applicability of nuclear techniques in an airport inspection facility is the inventory and lifetimes of radioactive isotopes produced by the neutron and gamma radiation inside the cargo, {{as well as the}} dose delivered by these isotopes to people in contact with the cargo during and following the interrogation procedure. Using MCNPX and CINDER 90 we have calculated the activation levels for several typical inspection scenarios. One example is the activation of various metal samples embedded in a cotton-filled container. To validate the simulation results, a benchmark experiment was performed, in which metal samples were activated by fast-neutrons in a water-filled glass jar. The induced activity was determined by analyzing the gamma spectra. Based on the calculated <b>radioactive</b> <b>inventory</b> in the container, the dose levels due to the induced gamma radiation were calculated at several distances from the container and in relevant time windows after the irradiation, in order to evaluate the radiation exposure of the cargo handling staff, air crew and passengers during flight.

40|$|The {{decommissioning}} of a {{light water}} reactor (LWR), which is licensed under § 7 of the German Atomic Energy Act, following the post-operational phase requires a comprehensive licensing procedure including in particular radiation protection aspects and possible impacts to the environment. Decommissioning includes essential changes in requirements for the systems and components and will mainly lead to the direct dismantling. In this context, neutron induced activation calculations for the structural components have {{to be carried out}} to predict activities in structures and to estimate future costs for conditioning and packaging. To avoid an overestimation of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>inventory</b> and to calculate the expenses for decommissioning as accurate as possible, modern state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo-Techniques (MCNP™) are applied and coupled with present-day activation and decay codes (ORIGEN-S).

In this paper the calculation procedure is described and the obtained results are presented with a validation along with measured activities and photon dose rates measured in the post-operational phase. The validation shows that the applied calculation procedure is suitable for the determination of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>inventory</b> of a nuclear power plant. Even the measured gamma dose rates in the post-operational phase at different positions in the reactor building agree within a factor of 2 to 3 with the calculation results.

The radioactive graphite {{issues associated with}} the Magnox reactors relate mainly to the reactor core graphite but, at two of the stations, there is also another graphite waste stream which results from the handling of their particular design of fuel elements which incorporate graphite fittings.
