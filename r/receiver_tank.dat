40|$|A vortex motion phase {{separator}} is disclosed for transferring {{a liquid}} in a zero gravity environment {{while at the}} same time separating the liquid from vapors found within either the sender or the receiving tanks. The separator comprises a rigid sender tank having a circular cross-section and rigid <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> having a circular cross-section. A plurality of ducts connects the sender tank and the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank.</b> Disposed within the ducts connecting the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> and the sender tank is a pump and a plurality of valves. The pump is powered by an electric motor and is adapted to draw either the liquid or a mixture of the liquid and the vapor from the sender tank. Initially, the mixture drawn from the sender tank is directed through a portion of the ductwork and back into the sender tank at a tangent to the inside surface of the sender tank, thereby creating a swirling vortex of the mixture within the sender tank. As the pumping action increases, the speed of the swirling action within the sender tank increases creating an increase in the centrifugal force operating on the mixture. The effect of the centrifugal force is to cause the heavier liquid to migrate to the inside surface of the sender tank and to separate from the vapor. When this separation reaches a predetermined degree, control means is activated to direct the liquid conveyed by the pump directly into the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank.</b> At the same time, the vapor within the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> is directed from the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> back into the sender tank.

50|$|In an oil-{{injected}} rotary-screw compressor, oil {{is injected}} into the compression cavities to aid sealing and provide cooling sink for the gas charge.

40|$|Architectures for {{extended}} duration missions often include an on-orbit replenishment {{of the space}} vehicle's cryogenic liquid propellants. Such a replenishment could be accomplished via a tank-to-tank transfer from a dedicated tanker or a more permanent propellant depot storage tank. Minimizing the propellant loss associated with transfer line and receiver propellant tank thermal conditioning is essential for mass savings. A new methodology for conducting tank-to-tank transfer while minimizing such losses has been demonstrated. Charge-Hold-Vent is the traditional methodology for conducting a tank-to-tank propellant transfer. A small amount of cryogenic liquid is introduced to chill the transfer line and propellant tank. As the propellant absorbs heat and undergoes a phase change, the tank internal pressure increases. The tank is then vented to relieve pressure prior to another charge of cryogenic liquid being introduced. This cycle is repeated until the transfer lines and tank are sufficiently chilled and the replenishment of the propellant tank is complete. This method suffers inefficiencies due to multiple chill and vent cycles within the transfer lines and associated feed system components. Additionally, this system requires precise measuring of cryogenic fluid delivery for each transfer, multiple valve cycling events, and other complexities associated with cycled operations. To minimize propellant loss and greatly simplify on-orbit operations, an alternate methodology has been designed and demonstrated. The Vented Chill / No Vent Fill method is a simpler, constant flow approach in which the propellant tank and transfer lines are only chilled once. The <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> is continuously vented as cryogenic liquid chills the transfer lines, tank mass and ullage space. Once chilled sufficiently, the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> valve is closed and the tank is completely filled. Interestingly, the vent valve can be closed prior to <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> components reaching liquid saturation temperature. An incomplete fill results if insufficient energy {{is removed from the}} tank's thermal mass and ullage space. The key to successfully conducting the no vent fill is to assure that sufficient energy is removed from the system prior to closing the <b>receiver</b> <b>tank</b> vent valve. This paper will provide a description of the transfer methodology and test article, and will provide a discussion of test results...|$|E
