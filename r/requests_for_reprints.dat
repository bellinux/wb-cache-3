40|$|Abstract: The present {{dilemma in}} {{providing}} dental {{services to the}} indigent and Medicaid recipients throughout this nation has generated considerable controversy as {{to the evolution of}} the problem. Most states recognize that there are deficiencies in the provision of dental services to these populations and are seeking resolutions. While state licensing board practices and dental professional society politics have been the object of criticism as contributing to if not causing of this problem, other rational and statistically valid explanations for the current difficulty exist. As an explanation for access to care issues, this paper explores the decline in the national numbers of dental practitioners and concomitant dental productivity. Furthermore, it relates those parameters to the dramatic rise in the utilization and demand for dental services resulting from a robust economy, population growth trends, and changes in state and federal Medicaid legislation that increase numbers of Medicaid-eligible recipients. While these general trends are national in scope and application, the state of North Carolina and its experience will be used to fully explore the impact of these trends {{at the state and local}} level.

40|$|The {{present study}} used the lens model to {{generate}} idiographic {{data in the}} context of individual judgement of work-family conflict/harmony. This model takes an individual’s differential dependence on various cues in a social judgement situation into account. Thirty females and 30 males participated in the two sessions of the study. Each participant was presented with 25 profiles. Each profile contained bar diagrams depicting differential magnitudes of harmony factors. The magnitude of each factor was systematically varied across profiles. Each participant was asked to examine a profile and indicate the extent of harmony experienced on a 20 -point scale. This procedure was repeated for conflict factors. Child-related support emerged as the most significantfactor. Emotional supportfrom spouse and clarity ofdivision of duties were moderately significant. Temperamental differences betweenpartners was a significant conflict-inducing criterion. Family demands and work obligations were significant for females only. Apart from generating relevant dimensions for the study of work-family linkages, the study also offered a possible framework of deriving indigenous parameters {{with the help of the}} lens model.

The research reported here contrasts the claims of a discontinuous, prefix-stripping model, and of a cohort-based continuous access model. In three experiments, using the gating, auditory lexical decision, and auditory naming tasks, we compared recognition-points for prefixed words (such as miscount) and their corresponding free stems (such as count). The results disconfirm the pretix-stripping model, showing that the recognition-point for a prefixed word {{was determined by the}} properties of the word as a complete, full form, and not, as a prefu-stripping model requires, by the properties of its stem. 6 1988 Academic PRSS, IIIC. The mental representation of lexical form constitutes the search space within which the listener conducts the on-line process of lexical access. The research we report here is concerned with the properties of these mental representations and with {{the manner in which they}} are accessed over time. It contrasts, in particular, theories of continuous and of discontinuous access, and their associated claims about the representation of lexical form.

40|$|Ten {{different}} {{phonological awareness}} tasks {{were administered to}} a group of kindergarten children whose reading ability was assessed 1 year later. The ex-traneous cognitive requirements inherent in the tasks varied widely. The children’s performance on three tasks that involved a rhyming response was at ceiling, and these tasks did not correlate with subsequent reading progress. The other seven measures were all moderately related to later reading ability and, employed in sets, were very strong predictors. The relative predictive accuracy of the phono-logical tasks was equal to or better than more global measures of cognitive skills such as an intelligence test and a reading readiness test. The phonological tasks had a large amount of common variance. Factor analysis revealed only one factor on which all the nonrhyming phonological tasks loaded highly. The results bolster the construct validity of phonological awareness, indicate considerable comparability and interchangeability among the tasks used to measure the construct, and are encouraging as regards the possible use of such tasks in predictive test batteries. Researchers interested in the cognitive determinants of early reading acquisition have increasingly focused on phonological awareness as a The authors thank Cecilia Wiar, Principal, and the teachers and students of Clarkston Elementary School, Clarkston, MI, for their cooperation.

40|$|Estimating {{parameters}} describing response time distributions is difficult. The {{most commonly used}} method for parameter estimation is the maximum likelihood method (ML). However, this method applied on the three-parameter Weibull distribution returns biased estimates {{and the amount of}} bias is unknown. A recent method, that we call nested maximum likelihood, was proposed by Gourdin, Hansen and Jaumard (1994). Due to its complexity, it has never been used and tested systematically. Here I compare it to the maximum likelihood method. The results shows that nested maximum likelihood is slightly better than ML. Although the gains are marginal, the method has important implications for future research in parameter estimation. Statistical methods in psychology are dominated by the normal distribution. However, very few measures in experimental psychology follow this distribution. For example, the time to complete a task (maybe the most direct access to cognitive processes) is always asymmetrical with a long tail to the right (e. g. Cousineau and Shiffrin, 2004, Hockley, 1984, with an exception, Hopkins and Kristofferson, 1980). Hence, it is of prime importance that we move towards a description of the response times (RTs) that acknowledge this asymmetry. The most natural such description assumes that there is a true minimum RT below which {{it is not possible to}} respond (fast-guessing notwithstanding). Then, three convenient descriptors could be: the lowest possible RT, the width of the distribution and the degree of asymmetry. See Rouder, Lu, Speckman, Sun and Jiang (2005) for reasons supporting this choice. Whereas the width is akin to standard deviation, We would like to thank Sébastien Hélie for his comments on an earlier version of this text. <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>reprint</b> should be addressed to Denis Cousineau, Département d...|$|R

A cross-sectional self-report survey of childhood family life and adolescent development was carried out with 357 university students aged 18 to 24 from Toronto, Canada. In women, earlier menarche was associated with more parental marital con ¯ ict in early childhood (birth to age 7), more parental marital unhappiness throughout childhood (birth to age 11), more independence from mother or father in late childhood (age 8 to 11), less anxiousness or internalising symptoms (anxiousness/depression) in late childhood (age 8 to 11), earlier age at dating men, and more boyfriends. In men, earlier spermarche was associated with father absence (birth to before spermarche), more stress in quality of family life, parental marital unhappiness, and parental marital con ¯ ict in early childhood (birth to age 7), more independence from mother or father in late childhood (age 8 to 11), earlier age at dating women, more girlfriends, and earlier age at sexual intercourse.
