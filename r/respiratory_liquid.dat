The population included a control group (CTL; 37 TW and 25 BAL) and a pathological group (PAT; 259 TW and 387 BAL), including horses either suffering from respiratory diseases including syndrome of tracheal inflammation, inflammatory airway disease, recurrent airway obstruction, or submitted to respiratory investigation because of exercise intolerance or poor performance. Each <b>respiratory</b> <b>liquid</b> was submitted to a standardised cytological analysis, mentioning the morphological abnormalities of exfoliated epithelial cells (ECAb) and ciliocytophthoria (CCPh) as markers of potential viral infection, as well as PCR assays including a consensus PCR and virus-specific PCR for both equine alphaherpesviruses (EHV- 1; EHV- 4) and gammaherpesviruses (EHV- 2; EHV- 5). The EHV infections were more prevalent in the TW of PAT group (= 0. 004), with the highest prevalence being for EHV- 2 (= 0. 006). The EHV detection in BALs was not significantly different between groups. The EHVs detection in TW was correlated to the polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) counts in the <b>respiratory</b> <b>liquid</b> but not with CCPh or ECAb. CCPh or ECAb were associated with both consensus PCR and EHV- 2 and EHV- 5 virus-type PCR in the BAL only. The significant detection of EHVs in the TW of PAT group in association with the PMN increased counts could lead to further investigations about their putative role in equine syndrome of tracheal inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Fully synthetic, biochemically inert and water-immiscible liquid perfluorochemicals (PFCs) are {{recognised}} as flexible liquid carriers/scavengers of gaseous compounds (respiratory gases mainly, i. e. O 2 and CO 2) {{and increasingly}} applied in bioprocess engineering. A range of unmatched physicochemical properties of liquid PFCs, i. e. outstanding chemo- and thermostability, extremely low surface tension, simultaneous hydro- and lipophobicity, which result from carbon chain substitution with fluorine atoms (the most electronegative chemical element) {{and the presence}} of intramolecular C-F bonds (the strongest single bond known in organic chemistry) have been described in detail. Exceptional propensity to solubility of <b>respiratory</b> gases in <b>liquid</b> perfluorinated compounds has been widely discussed. Advantages and disadvantages of bioprocess applications of liquid PFCs {{in the form of a}} pure PFC as well as in an emulsified form have been pointed out. A liquid PFC-mediated mass transfer intensification in various types of microbial, plant cell and animal cell culture systems: from miniaturised microlitre-scale cultures, via biomaterial-based scaffolds containing culture systems, to litre-scale bioreactors, has been reviewed and elaborated on bearing in mind the benefits of bioprocesses...|$|R
40|$|Objective: B. contaminans was cultured from <b>respiratory</b> {{secretions}} and <b>liquid</b> docusate (Colace) in a Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit (NICU) {{patient with}} community-acquired Legionnaire’s disease {{but not from}} another bottle given to the patient. Unexpectedly, C. pelliculosa was cultured from two bottles, but not the B. contaminans bottle or respiratory secretions. Methods: B. cepacia, later identified as B. contaminans, was cultured from a bottle of liquid docusate (Colace) dispensed to a non-cystic fibrosis patient. His respiratory secretions were colonized with B. contaminans. Results: Eradication of B. contaminans colonization in the patient’s respiratory secretions was attempted. With levofloxacin, B. contaminans developed multidrug resistance (MDR). Subsequent TMP-SMX therapy {{did not result in}} further MDR. Nine other ICU patients were given docusate from the same lot, but there were no other B. contaminans isolates. Conclusion: B. contaminans colonization of respiratory secretion may be difficult to eliminate. The significance of C. pelliculosa cultured from liquid docusate (Colace) remains to be elucidated. In this case, it appeared that B. contaminans may have inhibited the growth of C. pelliculosa in the same bottle. Others should be alerted to the possibility that C. pelliculosa may be present in B. contaminans–contaminated lots of liquid docusate (Colace) ...|$|R
40|$|The spleen is {{the most}} common primary site for hemangiosarcoma in dogs. The tumor is {{characterized}} by rapid growth and widespread metastasis, presumably due to both its tissue of origin, the vascular endothelium, and its resultant ready access to systemic circulation. The most common clinical presentation is a palpable abdominal mass, hemoperitoneum, anemia, shock and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. At the Small Annual Species Hospital (National Autonomous University of Mexico) arrived a German Shepherd dog, a 7 year old male with the next signs: Abdominal distention, depression and anorexia. At physical examination it showed weak pulse, cyanosis, high <b>respiratory</b> frequency and <b>liquid</b> in the abdominal cavity. The radiological study showed an image that was compatible with a peritoneal effusion. An abdominal puncture was made, and a sanguinolent liquid was obtained. Fluid therapy and blood transfusion were renovated and the hematocrit was decreased. After the therapy were established, a celiotomy extracting near 41 of intraperitoneal hemorrhagic liquid was done. Multiple tumoral nodules were observed in the spleen showing the origin of the bleeding. The liver presented several metastatic foci. A total splenectomy was performed taking also a biopsy of the hepatic nodules. The necropsy revealed large areas of hemorrhages and subcutaneous edema in the ventral abdomen. The liver had numerous subscapular hemorrhagic nodules; the other abdominal viscerae were icteric, and a few petechial hemorrhages were found on the serosae. Microscopic study of the affected organs showed primary foci of hemangiosarcoma in the spleen and metastasis to liver, epiploa and bronchial lymph nodules. There was also disseminated intravascular coagulation, because there was the presence of fibrin thrombi in alveolar capillaries in lungs and in glomerular capillaries in kidneys...|$|R
