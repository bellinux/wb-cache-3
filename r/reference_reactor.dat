5000|$|The gas-cooled {{fast reactor}} (GFR) {{system is a}} nuclear reactor design which is {{currently}} in development. Classed as a Generation IV reactor, it features a fast-neutron spectrum and closed fuel cycle for efficient conversion of fertile uranium and management of actinides. The <b>reference</b> <b>reactor</b> design is a helium-cooled system operating with an outlet temperature of 850 °C using a direct Brayton closed-cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency. Several fuel forms are being considered for their potential to operate at very high temperatures and to ensure an excellent retention of fission products: composite ceramic fuel, advanced fuel particles, or ceramic clad elements of actinide compounds. Core configurations are being considered based on pin- or plate-based fuel assemblies or prismatic blocks, which allows for better coolant circulation than traditional fuel assemblies.|$|E
40|$|Implementation of an in-mill {{biological}} treatment plant is one solution to {{the problems associated with}} closure of whitewater systems. It is, however, important to operate the treatment with low concentration of nutrients in the effluent. The effect on the COD reduction from decreased additions of NH 4 -N and PO 4 -P were investigated in three parallel aerobic suspended carrier reactors during treatment at 46 to 48 degreesC of whitewater from a recycled paper mill producing liner and fluting. In the <b>reference</b> <b>reactor,</b> a COD reduction of 89 % was achieved and 45. 6 mg NH 4 -N/(g COD reduced) and 11. 6 mg PO 4 -P/(g COD reduced) was consumed at an organic load around 20 kg COD/(m(3.) d). Reduced additions of NH 4 -N decreased the COD reduction. Addition of 56 % of the consumption of NH 4 -N in the <b>reference</b> <b>reactor</b> resulted in a COD reduction of 80 %. The response from decreased addition of PO 4 -P was different compared to NH 4 -N but it could not be determined if this is due to unsuitable experimental design or a different reaction mechanism. Reducing the addition of PO 4 -P to 26 % of the consumption of PO 4 -P in the <b>reference</b> <b>reactor,</b> decreased the COD reduction to 83 %. The main conclusion from the experiment is: {{biological treatment}} has the potential of treating whitewater from recycled paper mills with low effluent nutrient concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The PACTEL {{is a test}} {{facility}} designed to model the thermal-hydraulic behaviours of the Soviet-designed VVER- 440 pressurized water reactors currently in use in Finland. These reactors have unique features that differ from other PWR designs. The PACTEL simulates the major components and systems of the reference PWR, {{making it possible to}} examine postulated small- and medium-break LOCA's and operational transients. The PACTEL is a volume-scaled model (1 : 305). To ensure that gravitational forces remain equal to those in the <b>reference</b> <b>reactor,</b> the major components and systems in the PACTEL preserve a 1 : 1 elevation equivalence to the <b>reference</b> <b>reactor.</b> Preserving the elevation equivalence and scaling by volume results in relatively small hydraulic diameters.

The malfunction of the natural convection valve initiates core internal circulation loop directly proportional to the size of core bypasses.

During {{the severe}} {{accident}} in {{nuclear power plant}} (NPP), large amounts of fission products are released with accident progression, including In-vessel and Ex-vessel release.

40|$|Hydrogen was {{produced}} by aqueous-phase reforming (APR) of sorbitol in a carbon-on-alumina tubular membrane reactor (4 nm pore size, 7 cm long, 3 mm internal diameter) that allows the hydrogen gas to permeate to the shell side, whereas the liquid remains in the tube side. The hydrophobic nature of the membrane serves to avoid water loss and to minimize {{the interaction between the}} ceramic support and water, thus reducing the risks of membrane degradation upon operation. The permeation of hydrogen is dominated by the diffusivity of the hydrogen in water. Thus, higher operation temperatures result in an increase of the flux of hydrogen. The differential pressure has a negative effect on the flux of hydrogen due to the presence of liquid in the larger pores. The membrane was suitable for use in APR, and yielded 2. 5 times more hydrogen than a <b>reference</b> <b>reactor</b> (with no membrane).

Following the preliminary CFD results, the analysis of the air-ingress accident has been performed by two different codes: GAMMA code (system analysis code, Oh et al. 2006) and FLUENT CFD code (Fluent 2007). Eventually, the analysis results showed that the actual onset time of natural convection (~ 160 sec) would be significantly earlier than the previous predictions (~ 150 hours) calculated based on the molecular diffusion air-ingress mechanism.

40|$|AbstractTransferability of {{fracture}} toughness data obtained on small scale specimens to a full-scale cracked structure involves both in-plane and out-of-plane constraint effects. Both in-plane and out-of-plane constraint {{effects of a}} crack in a <b>reference</b> <b>reactor</b> pressure vessel (RPV) subjected to pressurized thermal shock (PTS) are analyzed by two-parameter and three-parameter methods. T 11 (the second term of William's extension acting parallel to the crack plane) generally displays a reversed relation to the stress intensity factor (SIF) with the transient time, which indicates that the loading (SIF) {{plays an important role}} on the in- plane constraint effect. T 33 (the second term of William's extension acting along the thickness) displays a different relation to T 11 during the transient. The results demonstrate that both in-plane and out-of-plane constraint effect should be analyzed separately in order to describe precisely the stress distribution ahead of the crack tip. The local approach to fracture, i. e. σ*-A* model is used to predict the in-plane and out-of-plane constraint effect by considering the micro mechanism of cleavage fracture...|$|E
