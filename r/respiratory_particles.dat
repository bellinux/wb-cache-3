Materials and methods: This study was conducted in three steps; evaluation of particulate air pollutants before design, design and implementation of local ventilation system and evaluation of local ventilation system. Sampling of respiratory and inhalational particles was done with the use of nylon cyclone and PVC filter according to the NIOSH 0600 method.

METHODS: We used a five-stage cascade impactor for bioaerosol collection in a coastal city on the eastern Mediterranean Sea during a north African dust storm. Bacterial communities associated with aerosol particles of six different size ranges were characterized following molecular culture–independent methods, regardless of the cell culturability (analysis of 16 S rRNA genes). RESULTS: All 16 S rDNA clone libraries were diverse, including sequences commonly found in soil and marine ecosystems. Spore-forming bacteria such as Firmicutes dominated large particle sizes (> 3. 3 µm), whereas clones affiliated with Actinobacteria (found commonly in soil) and Bacteroidetes (widely distributed in the environment) gradually increased their abundance in aerosol particles of reduced size (< 3. 3 µm).

Computational models, validated by experimental results, are then developed to explore the spatial relationships of supply-exhaust air ventilation in patient corridors. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine optimal HVAC design strategies to contain and remove airborne contaminants in healthcare environments. ^ In addition to occupant comfort, hospital HVAC systems are designed to provide ventilation and directional airflow to contain, dilute and remove contaminants including airborne disease. Of 183 epidemiological studies published worldwide from 1960 - 2005, however, only 10 studies were deemed by a panel of international experts as having conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of ventilation to control the spread of airborne disease in healthcare settings. ^ Two experimental tests were conducted; one placing patient corridors under directional airflow and the second placing the corridors under non-directional airflow. The purpose of these tests was to observe the spatial-temporal movement of artificially-generated aerosols with respect to particle size and ventilation mode and to assess the probability of contamination from infectious sources inside and outside of the patient area. Next, computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models were developed and validated by experimental results to test several ventilation rates with modified supply-exhaust air system configurations in patient corridors. ^ Results suggest that dissemination of bio-aerosols in hospital corridors could be exacerbated by directional airflow caused by either the spatial arrangement of supply-exhaust air ventilation, or, the pressure relationship between the corridor and surroundings spaces. Within the non-directional or ‘neutral’ airflow regime, modified supply-exhaust air system configurations reduced average particle concentration 30 % and transport distance more than 60 % without increasing air change rate. Aerosols ≤ 0. 5 μm, however, were observed more than 30 m from the source with comparatively less regard to airflow mode or supply-exhaust air system configuration. Ventilation arrangements can potentially reduce concentrations and improve distributions of particles. And, higher ventilation rates do not necessarily culminate in better results. ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDiesel {{emissions}} {{are a major}} contributor to combustion-generated airborne ambient particles. To understand the role of diesel particulate emissions on health effects, it is important to predict the actual particulate dose deposited in the human respiratory tract, with respect to number, surface area and mass. This is complicated by the agglomerate nature of some of these particles. In this study the respiratory tract deposition fraction in the size range 10 – 500 nm, was determined for 10 healthy volunteers during both idling and transient engine running conditions of a heavy duty diesel engine. The aerosol was characterized with respect to both chemical and physical properties including size resolved particle effective density. The dominating part of the emitted particles had an agglomerate structure. For those formed during transient running conditions, the relationship between particle mass and mobility diameter could be described by a power law function. This was not the case during idling, most likely because of volatile compounds condensing on the agglomerates. The <b>respiratory</b> tract <b>particle</b> deposition revealed large intra-subject variability with some subjects receiving a dose that was twice as high as that of others, when exposed to the same particle concentration. Associations were found between total deposited fractions (TDF), and breathing pattern. There was a difference between the idling and transient cycle with TDF being higher with respect to number during idling. The measured size-dependent deposition fraction of the agglomerated exhaust particles from both running conditions was nearly identical and closely resembled that of spherical hydrophobic particles, if plotted as a function of mobility diameter. Thus, for the size range covered, the mobility diameter could well describe the diameter-dependent <b>particle</b> <b>respiratory</b> tract deposition probability, regardless of the agglomeration state of the particles. Whilst mobility diameter well describes the deposition fraction, more information about particle characteristics is needed to convert this to volume equivalent diameter or estimate dose with respect to surface area or mass. A methodology is presented and applied to calculate deposited dose by surface area and mass of agglomerated particles. The methodology may be useful in similar studies estimating dose to the lung, deposition onto cell cultures and in animal studies...|$|R
40|$|Diesel {{emissions}} {{are a major}} contributor to combustion-generated airborne ambient particles. To understand the role of diesel particulate emissions on health effects, it is important to predict the actual particulate dose deposited in the human respiratory tract, with respect to number, surface area and mass. This is complicated by the agglomerate nature of some of these particles. In this study the respiratory tract deposition fraction in the size range 10 - 500 nm, was determined for 10 healthy volunteers during both idling and transient engine running conditions of a heavy duty diesel engine. The aerosol was characterized with respect to both chemical and physical properties including size resolved particle effective density. The dominating part of the emitted particles had an agglomerate structure. For those formed during transient running conditions, the relationship between particle mass and mobility diameter could be described by a power law function. This was not the case during idling, most likely because of volatile compounds condensing on the agglomerates. The <b>respiratory</b> tract <b>particle</b> deposition revealed large intra-subject variability with some subjects receiving a dose that was twice as high as that of others, when exposed to the same particle concentration. Associations were found between total deposited fractions (TDF), and breathing pattern. There was a difference between the idling and transient cycle with TDF being higher with respect to number during idling. The measured size-dependent deposition fraction of the agglomerated exhaust particles from both running conditions was nearly identical and closely resembled that of spherical hydrophobic particles, if plotted as a function of mobility diameter.

40|$|This study {{examines}} size-resolved physicochemical data for particles sampled near mining and smelting operations and a background urban site in Arizona {{with a focus}} on how hygroscopic growth impacts particle deposition behavior. Particles with aerodynamic diameters between 0. 056 - 18 μm were collected at three sites: (i) an active smelter operation in Hayden, AZ, (ii) a legacy mining site with extensive mine tailings in Iron King, AZ, and (iii) an urban site, inner-city Tucson, AZ. Mass size distributions of As and Pb exhibit bimodal profiles with a dominant peak between 0. 32 and 0. 56 μm and a smaller mode in the coarse range (> 3 μm). The hygroscopicity profile did not exhibit the same peaks owing to dependence on other chemical constituents. Submicrometer particles were generally more hygroscopic than supermicrometer ones at all three sites with finite water-uptake ability at all sites and particle sizes examined. Model calculations at a relative humidity of 99. 5 % reveal significant <b>respiratory</b> system <b>particle</b> deposition enhancements at sizes with the largest concentrations of toxic contaminants. Between dry diameters of 0. 32 and 0. 56 μm, for instance, ICRP and MPPD models predict deposition fraction enhancements of 171 %- 261 % and 33 %- 63 %, respectively, at the three sites. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Particle biokinetics is {{important}} in hazard identification and characterization of inhaled particles. Such studies intend to convert external to internal exposure or biologically effective dose, and may help to set limits in that way. Here {{we focus on the}} biokinetics of inhaled nanometer sized particles in comparison to micrometer sized ones. The presented approach ranges from inhaled particle deposition probability and retention in the respiratory tract to biokinetics and clearance of particles out of the <b>respiratory</b> tract. <b>Particle</b> transport into the blood circulation (translocation), towards secondary target organs and tissues (accumulation), and out of the body (clearance) is considered. The macroscopically assessed amount of <b>particles</b> in the <b>respiratory</b> tract and secondary target organs provides dose estimates for toxicological studies on the level of the whole organism. Complementary, microscopic analyses at the individual particle level provide detailed information about which cells and subcellular components are the target of inhaled particles. These studies contribute to shed light on mechanisms and modes of action eventually leading to adverse health effects by inhaled nanoparticles. We review current methods for macroscopic and microscopic analyses of particle deposition, retention and clearance. Existing macroscopic knowledge on particle biokinetics and microscopic views on particle organ interactions are discussed comparing nanometer and micrometer sized particles. We emphasize the importance for quantitative analyses and the use of particle doses derived from real world exposures...|$|R
40|$|Dry powder inhaler (DPI) is a {{dosage form}} for {{delivering}} fine drug powders to the <b>respiratory</b> tract. <b>Particle</b> size and size distribution, proportion of fines, particle shape, particle surface roughness, flow rate and adhesion force {{have been reported}} to affect the aerosolization process. Several mechanisms for particle dispersion in DPI have been considered; a proposed mechanism to explain the particle dispersion phenomenon is the active site theory. However, there have been several conflicting reports, therefore, an agglomeration/fracture hypothesis has been also proposed. Particle dispersion is associated with events such as impact, acceleration, shear stress, and turbulent flow. The aim {{of this study is to}} use high-speed video imaging to provide direct experimental observation of the particle dispersion process in order to unveil a mechanism for particle dispersion. Mixture of micronized lactose and coarse lactose carrier was placed in a model inhaler device, a high speed video imaging was used to capture the dry powder inhalation process. The flow pattern was found to be turbulent. Particles were observed to collide with one another, causing detachment of micronized particles from the surfaces of the coarse lactose particles. Impact of the powder agglomerates on the device grid also contributed to deaggregation and dispersion of the particles. The findings suggest that collision and impact are important mechanisms for the dispersion of DPI particles...|$|R
40|$|Age-specific {{quarterly}} asthmatic hospital {{discharge rates}} in Hong Kong during 1983 to 1989 {{were examined in}} relation to mean levels of six pollutants: sulfur dioxide (SO 2), ozone (O 3), total suspended <b>particles</b> (TSP), <b>respiratory</b> suspended <b>particles</b> (RSP), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and nitrogen oxides (NO(x)). Discharges from the hospital of children under 14 years of age represented 56 % of 33, 952 discharges recorded in all age groups. Trends of adult hospitalization rates over time remained stable during the study period. In children, however, {{there was an increase}} in these rates, particularly marked in the age group of 1 to 4 years. Univariate analysis revealed a strong correlation between quarterly mean TSP and hospital discharge rate for the 1 to 4 -year-old children (r =. 62, P <. 001). In the 5 to 14 -year-old age group, there was an inverse relationship between hospital discharge rate and sulfur dioxide level (r = -. 38, P <. 05). Stepwise multiple regression analysis, controlling for confounding variables (seasonal and annual trends of asthma hospitalizations) confirmed these relationships. A highly significant linear regression equation was derived between hospitalization rate for ages 1 to 4 years and total suspended particles (P <. 001). The highly significant correlation between pollution and asthmatic hospitalization rate for the 1 to 4 -year-old group suggests that young children are vulnerable to the adverse environmental effects of pollution. Auditing these relationships offers a logical basis for approaching control. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
