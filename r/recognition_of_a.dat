5|$|A {{constitutional}} {{convention was}} convened in Salt Lake City on March 8, 1849, {{to work on}} a proposal for federal <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> state or territory. The convention resulted in the provisional State of Deseret. Deseret claimed most of present-day Utah, Nevada and Arizona, with parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming. Brigham Young was elected governor on March 12, 1849, and the legislature first met on July 2, 1849. The state, having never been recognized by the federal government, was formally dissolved on April 5, 1851, several months after word of the creation of Utah Territory reached Salt Lake City.|$|E
5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at a glance. Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E
5|$|For much of Arsenal's history, {{their home}} colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though {{this has not}} always been the case. The choice of red is in <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{charitable}} donation from Nottingham Forest, soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, Fred Beardsley and Morris Bates, were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball. The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.|$|E

5|$|In 1829, the {{legislature}} appointed commissioners {{to locate a}} canal and layout the surrounding town. The commissioners employed James Thompson to survey and plat the town of Chicago, {{which at the time}} had a population of less than 100. Historians regard the August 4, 1830, filing of the plat as the official <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> municipalitely known as Chicago. Block 37 is one of the city's original 58 blocks in the layout of the town,.|$|E
5|$|Institute Professor is {{the highest}} title that can be awarded to {{a faculty member at}} the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a {{research}} university located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States. It is analogous to the titles of distinguished professor, university professor, or regents professor used at other universities in <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> professor's extraordinary research achievements and dedication to the school. At MIT, Institute Professors are granted a unique level of freedom and flexibility to pursue their research and teaching interests without regular departmental or school responsibilities; they report only to the provost. Usually no more than twelve professors hold this title at any one time. The position was created by President James R. Killian in 1951 and John C. Slater was the first to hold the position.|$|E
5|$|After {{the court}} adjourned, St-Calais was held as a {{prisoner}} at Wilton Abbey until his followers in Durham relinquished the castle. Once the castle was back under the king's control, St-Calais was released, and left for Normandy, and no more was heard of his appeal to Rome. Pope Urban II did write to the king in 1089 requesting that St-Calais be restored to his see, but nothing came of it. In Normandy, St-Calais quickly became one of Duke Robert's principal advisors and his chief administrator. On 14 November 1091 he regained the favour of William Rufus, and was restored to his see. Duke Robert had persuaded the king to allow Bishop William's return, perhaps in <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> service St-Calais performed for the king by brokering {{the end of a}} siege in Normandy that the king's forces were about to lose. The end of the siege prevented the loss of the castle.|$|E

5|$|Thanks {{to popular}} support within Poland, {{as well as}} to {{international}} support and media coverage, the Gdańsk workers held out until the government gave in to their demands. On August 21 a Governmental Commission (Komisja Rządowa) including Mieczysław Jagielski arrived in Gdańsk, and another one with Kazimierz Barcikowski was dispatched to Szczecin. On August 30 and 31, and on September 3, representatives of the workers and the government signed an agreement ratifying many of the workers' demands, including the right to strike. This agreement {{came to be known as}} the August or Gdańsk agreement (Porozumienia sierpniowe). Other agreements were signed in Szczecin (the Szczecin Agreement of August 30), and Jastrzębie-Zdrój on September 3. It was called the Jastrzębie Agreement (Porozumienia jastrzebskie) and as such is regarded as part of the Gdańsk agreement. Though concerned with labor-union matters, the agreement enabled citizens to introduce democratic changes within the communist political structure and was regarded as a first step toward dismantling the Party's monopoly of power. The workers' main concerns were the establishment of a labor union independent of communist-party control, and <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> legal right to strike. Workers' needs would now receive clear representation. Another consequence of the Gdańsk Agreement was the replacement, in September 1980, of Edward Gierek by Stanisław Kania as Party First Secretary.|$|E
5|$|US113 was reconstructed from Berlin to the Delaware {{state line}} in three {{sections}} starting in 1998. The first section was constructed {{on a new}} alignment from north of MD818 to south of MD589 to quell objections from residents of Friendship over the divided highway passing through their community. This segment, work on which included finishing the MD90 interchange 24 {{years after it was}} partially constructed, was completed in 2000. The second segment of US113 reconstruction, from south of MD589 to Jarvis Road, included two relocations from the old highway to reduce impacts to St. Martin's Episcopal Church and the community of Showell. The second section, including the interchange with MD589, was placed under construction in 2000 and was completed in 2002. The divided highway was completed to the Delaware state line after the second carriageway was added along the existing alignment north of Jarvis Road between 2001 and 2003. Sections of old alignment of US113, service roads, and reconstructed connections with other highways were designated MD575 starting in 2000. In November 2001, the National Partnership for Highway Quality awarded its Special <b>Recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Small Project Award to the Maryland Department of Transportation for the department's use of a modified design-bid-build contract approach to reduce the time needed to complete the first segment of the US 113 expansion north of Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Totti did recuperate in {{time and}} was {{eventually}} named to Lippi's final 23-man squad for the 2006 World Cup. Despite initial concerns over his match fitness, Totti was an important player in Marcello Lippi's team, and played in all seven games for Italy, including the victorious final against France, which Italy won on penalties, although he was substituted off in the 61st minute. He played the entire time in Germany with metal plates and screws in his ankle that {{had yet to be}} removed following the surgery. Throughout the tournament, he usually played as an attacking midfielder, in front of deep-lying playmaker Andrea Pirlo, and behind strikers Luca Toni, Alberto Gilardino, Vincenzo Iaquinta, or Filippo Inzaghi; these players were supported defensively by Gennaro Gattuso, Simone Perrotta and Daniele De Rossi in midfield. Totti finished the tournament with the joint-highest number of assists, along with his teammate Pirlo, Juan Román Riquelme, Bastian Schweinsteiger, and Luís Figo (4). Totti set up Pirlo's goal from a short corner in Italy's opening 2–0 win against Ghana, Marco Materazzi's goal from a corner in Italy's final group match, a 2–0 win against the Czech Republic, and two goals in a 3–0 win against Ukraine in the quarter-finals: the opener by Gianluca Zambrotta, and one of Luca Toni's goals. Totti also scored a goal via an injury-time penalty in Italy's 1–0 round of 16 win over Australia on 26 June, and was involved in Del Piero's last-minute extra-time goal in the semi-final, which sealed a 2–0 victory for the Italians over hosts Germany, and a place in the World Cup final. Throughout the competition, Totti completed 185 passes and took 19 shots; in <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful tournament, he was selected for the 23-man All-Star Team.|$|E
