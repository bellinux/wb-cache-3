However, AID techniques suffer from higher false alarm rate compared to signature-based intrusion detection techniques.

The identification of the intrusion context can help to significantly enhance the detection rate and lower the false alarm <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>AID</b> techniques. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the concept, a simple but representative scheme for intrusion context identification is proposed, in which the anomalies in the intrusive datasets are visualized first, and then the intrusion contexts are identified from the visualized anomalies.

In addition, as an application of the visualized anomalies, an implicit design drawback in t-stide is found after careful analysis. Finally, based on the identified intrusion context and the efficiency comparison, several findings are made which can offer useful insights and benefit future research on AID techniques. 1...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the role of}} class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) in virus infection, we have investigated {{the influence of the}} primary and secondary infections of influenza virus on mice deficient of activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID), which is absolutely required for CSR and SHM. In the primary infection, AID deficiency caused no significant difference in mortality but did cause difference in morbidity. In the secondary infection with a lethal dose of influenza virus, both AID �/ � and AID �/ � mice survived completely. However, AID �/ � mice could not completely block replication of the virus and their body weights decreased severely whereas AID �/ � mice showed almost complete prevention from the reinfection. Depletion of CD 8 � T cells by administration of an anti-CD 8 monoclonal antibody caused slightly severer body weight loss but did not alter the survival <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>AID</b> �/ � mice in secondary infection. These results indicate that unmutated immunoglobulin (Ig) M alone is capable of protecting mice from death upon primary and secondary infections. Because the titers of virus-neutralizing antibodies were comparable between AID �/ � and AID �/ � mice {{at the time of the}} secondary infection, a defect of AID �/ � mice in protection of morbidity might be due to the absence of either other Ig classes such as IgG, high affinity antibodies with SHM, or both.

Since many recipient countries are dependent on aid, disbursement delays might matter for its effectiveness. The emphasis is put on the so-called pipeline approach, according to which, in the short run, disbursement constraints may lead to huge delays and weak <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> disbursement relative to commitments. After the literature review on disbursement delays, we use the framework <b>of</b> programmable <b>aid</b> to run some econometric estimations through a dynamic model, an ARDL, for a panel of 48 African countries during the period of 1975 – 2008. We find disbursement constraints mainly at the short-run level, while the main donor's specific factors seem to be the selectivity and the degree <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> fragmentation.

40|$|Activation-induced {{cytidine}} deaminase (AID) is {{an enzyme}} that initiates the secondary antibody diversification events of somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch recombination (CSR). AID {{is expressed in}} activated B lymphocytes and deaminates cytidines to uridines, thus introducing mutations and/or double-strand breaks throughout the immunoglobulin (Ig) locus. Although AID activity is mostly targeted to the Ig locus, it mutates many other genes at lower rates and this off-target activity induces genomic lesions leading to transformation of B cells. The structure of AID has not been solved, which is partially the reason that several important questions remain unanswered about its mechanism of action. Our lab has recently shown that AID from different species has disparate rates of deamination, and that the deamination <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>AID</b> from each species is thermosensitive, such that fish AID are cold-adapted relative to human AID. Here, we have measured the activity of purified AID from human, zebrafish, channel catfish, pufferfish (takifugu), and hybrid AID containing {{various parts of the}} aforementioned, over a wide range and fine increments of temperatures. Our aim was to elucidate the relationship between thermosensitivity of AID and its primary structure, by identifying region(s) and/or residue(s) within the enzyme that affect thermosensitivity. We found that this characteristic is mostly determined by the C-terminus in the sense that swapping this region resulted in transferring thermosensitivity patterns from the donor enzyme. We also found that AID activity is not always optimal at native physiological temperature, such that human AID is optimal at 32 °C instead of 37 °C. Based on our data, we postulated that this finding may have implications for evolution of AID. Overall, our work has shed light on mechanistic features of AID as well as aspects on its evolution...|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{the author}} explores whether the growing {{presence}} of Chinese financial assistance is decreasing the bargaining power of traditional donors vis-à-vis African governments. The article relies {{on data from}} an original survey of high-ranking donor officials working in multiple African countries, as well as case-studies of Chinese engagement in three diverse African country contexts: Ghana, Uganda and Tanzania. It finds that claims of a ‘silent revolution’ in development cooperation due to China's increased involvement {{in the region are}} overstated. Among donor officials, there is far from consensus that China is decreasing the bargaining power of their agency. On the contrary, evidence from Ghana, Tanzania and Uganda suggests that traditional development aid continues {{to play an important role}} and that, in practice, China rarely directly competes with traditional donors. There are, however, two important caveats to this claim. First, when China and traditional donors do directly compete—for example, on infrastructure projects—many recipient governments prefer assistance from China. Second, given China's interest in expanding markets and acquiring natural resources, countries receiving higher amounts of Chinese official finance are likely to have lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> dependence. As a result, financing from China is likely to be correlated with a decline in the bargaining power of traditional donors, even if it is not causing such a decline...|$|R

In this paper, we present a method for estimation and compensation of the mismatch errors. The estimation method requires no knowledge about the input signal except {{that it should be}} bandlimited to the Nyquist frequency for the complete ADC system.

Furthermore, we found that most AID conformations exhibit fully or partially occluded catalytic pockets.

40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{estimated}} in overseas studies that between 1 % and 40 % <b>of</b> hearing <b>aids</b> dispensed are not used (Dillon et al, 1999; Kochkin, 2005; Lupsakko & Kautiainen, 2005; Parving & Sibelle, 2001; Smeeth et al, 2002; Stark & Hickson, 2004). Hearing aid non-use has not been evaluated in the New Zealand context, so it is {{the aim of this}} study to determine the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> hearing <b>aid</b> non-use in New Zealand and to investigate factors that may predict whether hearing aid adopters go on to be successful hearing aid users. Methods: Participants engaged in a phone interview that was conducted to investigate factors affecting hearing aid use. The interview questions were related to the Health Belief Model and thus focused on perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived barriers, perceived benefits and self-efficacy <b>of</b> hearing <b>aid</b> use. Descriptive qualitative analysis was then applied to analyse themes from the interviews. Results: Ten barriers and nine facilitators to hearing aid use in New Zealand were found. Perceived severity and self-efficacy were also studied in relation to hearing aid use. It was found that perceived severity did affect hearing aid use, with those who perceive their hearing severity to be worse, wearing their hearing aids more than those who perceive no or little hearing difficulty. Whereas self-efficacy <b>of</b> hearing <b>aid</b> management did not have a significant relationship with hearing aid use. Conclusion: The results from this study highlight reasons why hearing aid adopters become successful or unsuccessful hearing aid users. It is hoped clinicians will be able to provide additional support to those who are considered unsuccessful users or at risk of becoming an unsuccessful user...|$|R
