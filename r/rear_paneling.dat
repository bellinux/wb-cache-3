50|$|Although it was {{supposed}} to be the sports model of the Triumph range, the Tiger 110 was later fitted with the <b>rear</b> <b>paneling</b> that was introduced with Triumph's 350cc 3TA twin in 1959. This rear cowling earned it the nickname 'bathtub' from its shape and made the T110 look somewhat staid. In any event, from 1959, the T120 Bonneville was now Triumph's leading sports model and before the introduction of Edward Turner's unit construction 650cc twin in 1962, the T110 was dropped from Triumph's range.|$|E
25|$|The {{prototype}} first flew on 30 May 1939 {{powered by}} two Walter Sagitta I-SR air cooled vee piston engines. The trial flights identified {{problems with the}} cooling of the rear engine and general engine performance. It was proposed to use Rolls-Royce or Daimler-Benz engines in the production aircraft. Concerns were also raised about the pilot clearing the rear propeller {{if he had to}} bail out and an ejector seat was studied. As a provisional solution, rails were put {{on both sides of the}} forward fuselage for the Fokker test pilot, Gerben Sonderman, to use to bail out in an emergency. The aircraft was flown 11 times for a total flight time of less than four hours. The <b>rear</b> fuselage <b>paneling</b> was modified significantly before the last few flights in an attempt to address chronic rear engine cooling problems. On the 11th flight in April, the undercarriage was damaged, and the programme was abandoned in May 1940 when the German forces invaded the Netherlands.|$|R
