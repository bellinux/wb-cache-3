5|$|The first {{establishment}} of Nonconformists in Poulton were the Methodists, in 1784. The group {{met in a}} <b>room</b> <b>behind</b> the King's Arms and initially suffered persecution from other locals. They built a chapel {{in what is now}} Church Street in 1819, the second Methodist chapel to be built on the Fylde. The chapel was enlarged in 1861 and 1909 and finally demolished in 1970, replaced by a new chapel in Queen Street. The Congregational church established a chapel in the town in 1809. Its use was intermittent and at one point the building was used as a warehouse. A new chapel was built in 1899.|$|E

25|$|In December 1952, when Lula {{was only}} 7 years old, his mother {{decided to move}} to São Paulo with her {{children}} to rejoin her husband. After a journey of thirteen days in a pau-de-arara (open truck bed), they arrived in Guarujá and discovered that Aristides had formed a second family with Valdomira. Aristides' two families lived in the same house for some time, but they did not get along very well, and four years later, Eurídice moved with her children to a small <b>room</b> <b>behind</b> a bar in São Paulo. After that Lula rarely saw his father, who became an alcoholic and died in 1978.|$|E

25|$|When in 1684 Louis XIV {{moved into}} the {{adjacent}} room to the south (the chambre du roi), this central <b>room</b> <b>behind</b> {{the facade of the}} avant-corps was designated as the salon du roi or the salon où le roi s’habille ("the room in which the king dresses"). For 17 years, it served as venue for the ceremonies that surrounded the life of the king, such as the lever and the coucher. When the chambre de Louis XIV was established in 1701, the archways to the Hall of Mirrors were sealed off, and the room became the ideological as well as physical focal point of the palace. The king died in this room on 1September 1715. Later, Louis XV and Louis XVI would continue to use it for the lever and the coucher. On 6 October 1789, Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and the Dauphin appeared on the balcony before the mob that forced the royal family to move from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2010 {{the church}} was subject to Archaeological Monitoring and Recording during {{excavations}} {{as part of the}} establishment of welfare services. The £135,000 refurbishment added a tower meeting <b>room</b> <b>behind</b> a new screen, an oak kitchen, toilets and central heating. The works included construction of a pit for an oil storage tank for a new boiler. Trenches were dug within the churchyard, tower and north aisle. Some human remains, including a child's, were unearthed in the churchyardsubsequently reburiedas was animal bone. Stone foundations at the south from the church were found that predate the tower. Pieces of 5th- to 8th-century Saxon to 19th-century pottery were found, and possible post holes that might indicate timber structures as part of the church's history. Some pottery was identified as being from Staffordshire and Derbyshire. An Early Medieval floor of layered straw was exposed. Tower floor excavations uncovered fragments of 19th-century glass and ironwork, and evidence of pre-14th- or 15th-century stonework that had been integrated into the tower.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} 1838 {{structure was}} relatively small; only two storeys tall with a full-height, central, curved bay, and an accordingly curved pediment on top, the villa {{was designed by}} Thomas McKay (who had also designed and built Earnscliffe) in a Regency style, inspired {{by the work of}} architect Sir John Soane, who had himself designed a never realised government house for the then capital of Upper Canada, York, in 1818. Unlike the present arrangement, the rooms of the McKay villa for entertaining, sleeping, and service were dispersed throughout the two floors of the structure, with the main parlour located on the second level, in an oval <b>room</b> <b>behind</b> the curved, south bay, which National Capital Commission Chief Architect David Scarlett said in 2014 was made in such a shape so as to display the advanced abilities of McKay's stonemasons. The main entrance to the house was on the west side and opened into a hall with stairs to the upper floor directly ahead. Along the south front were a library, a dining room, and a boudoir, all with French doors opening onto a narrow balcony; the dining room was served by three of these doors, one of which now opens into the Tent Room's antechamber, one into the Long Gallery, and one that still opens to the outside. The French door originally opening from the boudoir is today the window of the Pauline Vanier Room.|$|E
50|$|Two <b>rooms</b> <b>behind</b> {{the stables}} also once served horse-related functions. One retains the iron {{hitching}} posts and wood flooring. The other {{has been converted}} into a kitchen, with those features removed.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, new gameday locker <b>rooms</b> <b>behind</b> {{the north}} end zone (underneath the newly {{completed}} Campus Rec Center) were added, {{as well as a}} new bigger video board above {{the north end}} zone.|$|R

500|$|Other {{than the}} {{modifications}} to the guns to use British ammunition no changes {{were made to the}} [...] secondary armament.

Each gun was provided with 100 high explosive shells and 100 Common-pointed, capped shells. The magazine for the two side guns was shared between them, with a shell room directly under each turret. The boiler room was {{directly in front of the}} magazine and the engine <b>room</b> <b>behind</b> it.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{of housing}} and shops in Cardiff Road was {{undertaken}} between 1897 and 1901. A power station was erected next to the Assembly <b>Rooms</b> <b>behind</b> the West End Hotel, to provide electrical power for the West End Hotel.|$|R

500|$|Nolan {{has also}} {{stressed}} the importance of establishing a clear point of view in his films, and makes frequent use of [...] "the shot that walks into a <b>room</b> <b>behind</b> a character, because... that takes [...] inside the way that the character enters". He has also used cinéma-vérité techniques (such as hand-held camera work) to convey realism. In an interview at the Film Society of Lincoln Center, he explained his emphasis on realism in The Dark Knight trilogy: [...] "You try and get the audience to invest in cinematic reality. When I talk about reality in these films, it's often misconstrued as a direct reality, but it's really about a cinematic reality." ...|$|E
500|$|In Las Hilanderas, {{probably}} {{painted the}} year after Las Meninas, two different scenes from Ovid are shown: one in contemporary dress in the foreground, and the other partly in antique dress, played before a tapestry on {{the back wall of}} a <b>room</b> <b>behind</b> the first. According to the critic Sira Dambe, [...] "aspects of representation and power are addressed in this painting in ways closely connected with their treatment in Las Meninas". In a series of portraits of the late 1630s and 1640s—all now in the Prado—Velázquez painted clowns {{and other members of the}} royal household posing as gods, heroes, and philosophers; the intention is certainly partly comic, at least for those in the know, but in a highly ambiguous way.|$|E
500|$|At {{the centre}} of this wing is the famous balcony with the Centre <b>Room</b> <b>behind</b> its glass doors. This is a Chinese-style saloon {{enhanced}} by Queen Mary, who, working with the designer SirCharles Allom, created a more [...] "binding" [...] Chinese theme in the late 1920s, although the lacquer doors were brought from Brighton in 1873. Running {{the length of the}} piano nobile of the east wing is the great gallery, modestly known as the Principal Corridor, which runs the length of {{the eastern side of the}} quadrangle. It has mirrored doors, and mirrored cross walls reflecting porcelain pagodas and other oriental furniture from Brighton. The Chinese Luncheon Room and Yellow Drawing Room are situated at each end of this gallery, with the Centre Room obviously placed in the centre.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two rooms}} {{on either side}} of the rear of the chapel. When the school was first built the two <b>rooms</b> <b>behind</b> the chapel were used by the priests as living quarters, but now they are the {{headquarters}} for the school's active Chaplaincy Team.|$|R
50|$|Inside {{the church}} are the {{original}} simple pews and finely carved altar rail. Three <b>rooms</b> <b>behind</b> the altar once provided living quarters for the priest whenever {{he stayed in}} the village. Father Mazzuchelli opened a school in these rooms in 1847 and staffed the small school with Sinsinawa Dominican Sisters.|$|R
50|$|It {{was divided}} into three {{horizontal}} sections (diazomata).

500|$|Luke is beardless and in {{his early}} 40s, [...] close to van der Weyden's age in the mid-1430s. His face is not idealised; he is middle-aged with light stubble and greying hair. [...] The <b>room</b> <b>behind</b> him {{contains}} his attributes including an ox and an open book representing his Gospel. He is painted with more naturalism than Mary; his eyes in particular are more realistically drawn. Christ's conform to the then idealised form, as simple crescents. Mary's are formed from curved lines typical of late Gothic ideals of feminine beauty. Compared to contemporary paintings of this type, the work is unusually free of inscriptions; they appear only on items in Luke's study, dimly perceived on his right: on a book, on an ink bottle, and on a scroll emanating {{from the mouth of}} his ox, beneath the small desk.|$|E
500|$|As a stop-gap measure, the {{fortified}} vaults in {{the basement}} of the United States Treasury Building were converted into living quarters for the president and his family, to be used in the event an attack came prior to the bunker's completion. Unlike the White House, which was a fragile structure with what was then a shallow basement, the Treasury Building has a deep basement built into a foundation of granite and its vaults are nested into stone. The ten-room presidential suite sat two floors below the cash <b>room</b> <b>behind</b> a steel bank door and was described as [...] "every bit as nice as a suite at the Mayflower Hotel". The tunnel, connecting the White House to the open areaway of the Treasury Building, was excavated to allow the evacuation of the president from one building to the other without the need to make the crossing outdoors.|$|E
500|$|As the {{revolution}} progressed, rebel strength peaked at around 50,000 fighters. Despite their initial successes, the rebel leaders were seldom on good terms, and constant infighting plagued their camp. In {{the western part}} of the country, Jakov Nenadović was the principle figure. In the east, Milenko Stojković and Petar Dobrnjac held sway. The latter two opposed Karađorđe's attempts to create a centralized state, fearing that this would result in their own power being diminished. Others, such as Nenadović, complained that Karađorđe was becoming too authoritarian. Nenadović suggested that the rebels establish a central council to rein in Karađorđe's power and write up a constitution based on the rule of law. Karađorđe balked at the possibility. [...] "It's easy for this sovereign law of yours to rule in a warm <b>room,</b> <b>behind</b> this table," [...] he responded, [...] "but let us see tomorrow, when the Turks strike, who will meet them and beat them." ...|$|E
50|$|However, even it its severe {{design the}} façade betrays some {{internal}} secrets, {{the first floor}} is obviously a piano nobile, as {{a hint of the}} importance of this floor is indicated on the exterior by, not only tall pedimented windows but also above them blind windows indicating the double height of the reception <b>rooms</b> <b>behind</b> them.|$|R

50|$|For {{about the}} next 40 years, the school was housed in various British schools in the City of Birmingham and in <b>rooms</b> <b>behind</b> the church, used temporarily.

Since then, the school has been housed next to the church, in its own separate premises.|$|R
