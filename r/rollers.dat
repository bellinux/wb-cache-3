5|$|The long-tailed {{ground roller}} is a shy and elusive bird and, if {{seen by a}} human observer, it either freezes or runs away. As its short wings suggest, the species rarely flies, {{but it is a}} {{powerful}} runner. While largely terrestrial, it roosts in low trees and bushes, and sings from low perches. Long-tailed ground <b>rollers</b> are solitary outside the breeding season. Although diurnal, it does occasionally forage at night unlike most other ground <b>rollers.</b> When calling, this ground roller bobs its head and raises its tail. The long-tailed ground roller also raises its tail when it is excited.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Double-row tapered <b>roller</b> bearing 353112 {{is used in}} trucks, and the {{external}} load and pressure distribution of the bearing are calculated combining with the specific operating conditions. Tapered <b>roller</b> bearings typically employ <b>roller</b> profile modification to equalize the load distribution, minimize the stress concentration at the <b>roller</b> ends. Doing FEA (finite element analysis) on the contact stress with the changing <b>roller</b> crowning between <b>roller</b> and races, the appropriate <b>roller</b> profile and the crown drop of <b>roller</b> can be achieved. Finally the best control equation of <b>roller</b> crowning is given out. It has important guiding significance {{for the improvement of}} <b>roller</b> crowning design of truck hub bearings...|$|R

5|$|The flaps {{are mounted}} by steel sliders and <b>rollers,</b> {{attached}} to brackets {{on the rear}} spar. The trapezoidal ailerons are near the wingtips. The fuselage of the Su-25 has an ellipsoidal section and is of semi-monocoque, stressed-skin construction, arranged as a longitudinal load-bearing framework of longerons, beams and stringers, with a transverse load-bearing assembly of frames.

5|$|This {{same general}} {{area of the}} {{property}} was used also for the drying of the varnished fabric. This consisted of twenty foot high clothes line-type poles that were 100 feet apart and further protected by wind-break fences of canvas. Between the poles were strung wires for laying the wet varnished fabric onto for drying. After drying the fabric was then rewound onto <b>rollers</b> and varnished {{over and over again}} several more times to each side and thoroughly dried each time.

5|$|Vehicles {{built in}} 1940 (only) were fitted with {{removable}} loading ramps, cable <b>rollers</b> {{to act as}} pulleys, and a reinforced tail gate to allow a Flak 30, mounted on a Sd.Ah. 51 trailer, to be quickly dismounted. From 1940 they were fitted with rifle racks over the front fenders and from 1942 these were given sheet metal covers as protection from the weather. Flak 38s were mounted on 10/4s beginning in 1941 although the platform wasn't widened until later. As the war progressed the guns were more often fitted with gun shields.|$|E
5|$|When a {{specimen}} of the African river martin from Gabon was first formally described by German zoologist Gustav Hartlaub in 1861, {{it was not}} initially identified {{as a member of}} the swallow and martin family. Hartlaub placed it with the <b>rollers,</b> and later authors either put it in its own separate family, or with the woodswallows. It was only following study of the anatomy of the species by Lowe that it was determined to be closely related to the swallows and martins, but sufficiently different that it could be placed in a separate subfamily Pseudochelidoninae.|$|E
5|$|Both {{tracks and}} wheels {{were used for}} {{steering}}.

The drive sprocket had the track-saving but more complicated <b>rollers</b> rather than the more common teeth. The rear suspension consisted of five double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the Schachtellaufwerk layout, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front axle had transversely mounted leaf springs and shock absorbers - the only ones on the vehicle.|$|E

50|$|<b>Roller</b> Game was a {{variation}} of the sport of <b>roller</b> derby that was played in Japan by the <b>Roller</b> Game League, established in 1990. <b>Roller</b> Game was played on either a flat or banked track, and on either traditional (quad) <b>roller</b> skates or inline skates.

The rear suspension consisted of six double roadwheels, overlapping and interleaved in the usual Schachtellaufwerk system used for German half-track vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars. An idler wheel, mounted {{at the rear of the}} vehicle, was used to control track tension. The front wheels had leaf springs and shock absorbers.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of his {{earliest}} recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and <b>rollers</b> like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk and pop.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{people could}} {{do little to}} protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating the insects {{may have been some}} consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where eggs were laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with <b>rollers</b> and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
