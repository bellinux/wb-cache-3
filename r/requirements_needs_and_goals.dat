40|$|Critical aspect in {{the modern}} {{e-learning}} systems is selecting the most adequate learning materials based on learners’ <b>requirements,</b> <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> knowledge <b>goals.</b> It is especially important because of information overload. In addition, e-learning systems should deliver learning materials to learners in the format adequate to their learning style. On the other hand, it is common practice to use tags in order to filter the most useful learning materials because they allow learners to mark or highlight some learning materials with their own tags. In that way learners contribute to organizing and retrieving useful learning materials. Our previous research was focused on tag-based collaborative filtering and learning style determination in order to suggest useful learning material in adequate format. In this paper, we propose a new tag-based collaborative algorithm that takes in consideration the factors that affect the tag-based collaborative filtering {{in order to develop}} more efficient and accurate algorithm, and suggest the learning materials based on posted tags rating and students rating. The developed system was implemented at the Faculty of Law – Bitola, and the evaluation results are shown in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Important aspect in {{the modern}} {{e-learning}} systems is selecting the most adequate learning materials based on learners’ <b>requirements,</b> <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> knowledge <b>goals.</b> Recommender systems based on collaborative filtering contribute to overcoming the information overload in personalized learning environments. That’s why there is imminent need of using systems that {{have the capability to}} detect the learners’ <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> to recommend them the most adequate learning context. In recent years, it is common practice to use tags in the process of filtering the most useful learning materials.

40|$|The Center for Studies in Higher Education, with generous {{funding from}} the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, is {{conducting}} research to understand the <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> desires of faculty for inprogress scholarly communication (i. e., forms of communication employed as research is being executed) as well as archival publication. In the interest of developing {{a deeper understanding of}} how and why scholars do what they do to advance their fields, as well as their careers, our approach focuses in fine-grained analyses of faculty values and behaviors throughout the scholarly communication lifecycle, including sharing, collaborating, publishing, and engaging with the public. Well into our second year, we have posted a draft interim report describing some of our early results and impressions ased on the responses of more than 150 interviewees in the fields of astrophysics, archaeology, biology, economics, history, music, and political science. Our work to date has confirmed the important impact of disciplinary culture and tradition on many scholarly communication habits. These traditions may override the perceived "opportunities" afforded by new technologies, including those falling into the Web 2. 0 category. As we have listened to our diverse informants, as well as followed closely the prognostications about the likely future of scholarly communication, we note that it is absolutely imperative to be precise about terms. That includes being clear about what is meant by "open access" publishing (i. e., using preprint or postprint servers for scholarship published in prestigious outlets versus publishing in new, untested open access journals, or the more casual individual posting of working papers, blogs, and other non-peer-reviewed work). Our research suggests that enthusiasm for technology development and adoption should not be conflated with the hard reality of tenure and promotion <b>requirements</b> (including the <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>goals</b> of final archival publication) in highly competitive professional environments...|$|R
