50|$|The FSA type {{lubricator}} differs by each pump {{having two}} separate pistons {{to control the}} pumping & distribution of oil. The pistons are driven by cams on the driving shaft. The driving shaft is driven via a means of a roller <b>ratchet</b> <b>assembly</b> which converts the reciprocating motion of the operating linkage to rotary motion.|$|E
50|$|The DV {{range was}} {{available}} in range of sizes with capacities ranging from 8 to 36 pints, {{and the number of}} feeds from 1 to 26. Each of the lubricators consist of a reservoir, a <b>ratchet</b> <b>assembly,</b> a sliding shaft assembly, and the pump units. A screwed oil filler cap is fitted to the lockable hinged lid of the reservoir and a sight glass for indicating the oil level is fitted to the front face of the reservoir. The pumps of the DV type lubricator are operated by a sliding shaft assembly, unlike the Silverton or Wakefield lubricators which are operated by a rotating camshaft.|$|E
5000|$|Impact {{wrenches}} {{are available}} in all sizes and in several styles, depending on the application. ¼" [...] drive wrenches are commonly available in both inline (the user holds the tool like a screwdriver, with the output on the end) and pistol grip (the user holds a handle which is {{at right angles to}} the output) forms, and less commonly in an angle drive, which is similar to an inline tool but with a set of bevel gears to rotate the output 90°. ⅜" [...] impacts are most commonly available in pistol grip form and a special inline form known as a [...] "butterfly" [...] wrench, which has a large, flat throttle paddle {{on the side of the}} tool which may be tilted to one side or the other to control the direction of rotation, rather than using a separate reversing control, and shaped to allow access into tight areas. Regular inline and angle ⅜" [...] drive impact wrenches are uncommon, but available. ½" [...] drive units are virtually only available in pistol grip form, with any inline type being virtually impossible to obtain, due to the increased torque transmitted back to the user and the greater weight of the tool requiring the larger handle. ¾" [...] drive impact wrenches are again essentially only available in pistol grip form. 1" [...] drive tools {{are available in}} both pistol grip and [...] "D handle" [...] inline, where the back of the tool has an enclosed handle for the user to hold. Both forms often also incorporate a side handle, allowing both hands to hold the tool at once. 1¼" [...] and larger wrenches are usually available in [...] "T handle" [...] form, with two large handles on either side of the tool body, allowing for maximum torque to be applied to the user, and giving the best control of the tool. Very large impact wrenches (up to several hundred thousand foot-pounds of torque) usually incorporate eyelets in their design, allowing them to be suspended from a crane, lift, or other device, since their weight is often more than a person can move. A recent design combines an impact wrench and an air ratchet, often called a [...] "reactionless air ratchet" [...] by the manufacturers, incorporating an impact assembly before the <b>ratchet</b> <b>assembly.</b> Such a design allows very high output torques with minimal effort on the operator, and prevents the common injury of slamming one's knuckles into some part of the equipment when the fastener tightens down and the torque suddenly increases. Specialty designs are available for certain applications, such as removing crankshaft pulleys without removing the radiator in a vehicle.|$|E
40|$|The Bremsstrahlung safety shutter is an {{important}} device for synchrotron radiation facility personal safety. The APS front ends have double redundant safety shutter assemblies (as per PSAR requirements) that are located about 22. 6 m from the source, just upstream of the <b>ratchet</b> wall. These <b>assemblies</b> are needed to guard against an accidental positron beam loss during injection and normal operation, which then can result in high energy Bremsstrahlung radiation being directed down the front end into the First Optics Enclosure (FOE) and the experimental station. In the APS top-up mode of operation, the positron injection will be continued during the normal operation. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} have special Bremsstrahlung shielding to protect the downstream experimental area. There are many ways to do this, but the most economical way is to design a special long Bremsstrahlung collimator in the front-end area. The better the collimation in the front end, the less the shielding material needed in the beamline. The major difficulty in designing the front-end special Bremsstrahlung collimator is the space problem. In the APS, the total length available for the APS ID front end is only about 7. 6 m; there is not extra space for additional collimators. To solve this problem, we propose here a novel integrated design that will provide the functions of both a Bremsstrahlung collimator and a safety shutter...|$|R
40|$|The USA LLC Materials & Processes (M&P) Engineering Department had {{recommended}} the application {{and evaluation of}} Ion Vapor Deposition (IVD) aluminum to SRB Hardware for corrosion protection and elimination of hazardous materials and processes such as cadmium plating. IVD is an environmentally friendly process that has no volatile organic compounds (VOCs), or hazardous waste residues. It lends itself to use with hardware exposed to corrosive seacoast environments as found at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS), Florida. Lifting apparatus initially coated with cadmium plating for corrosion protection; was stripped and successfully re-coated with IVD aluminum after the cadmium plating no longer protected the GSE from corrosion, Since then, and after completion of a significant test program, the first flight application of the IVD Aluminum process on the Drogue Parachute <b>Ratchet</b> <b>Assembly</b> is scheduled for 2002...|$|E
