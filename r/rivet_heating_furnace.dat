40|$|Based on {{thermal value}} theory, {{the aim of}} this paper is to deduce the {{theoretical}} formulas for evaluating the energy ef-fective utilization degree in technological pyrological processes exemplified by metallurgical <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces.</b> <b>Heat</b> transfer models for continuous <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces,</b> batch-type <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces,</b> and regenerative <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces</b> are es-tablished, respectively. By analyzing the movement path of injected infinitesimal heat attached on steel or gas, thermal value equations of continuous, batch-type, and regenerative <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces</b> are derived. Then the influences of such factors as hot charging, gas preheating and intake time of heat on energy effective utilization degree are discussed by thermal value equations. The results show that thermal value rises with hot charging and air preheating for continuous <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces,</b> with shorter intake time when heat is attached on steel or longer intake time when heat is attached on gas for batch-type <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces</b> and that with more heat supply at early heating stage or less at late stage for regen-erative <b>heating</b> <b>furnaces...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Industrial <b>heating</b> <b>furnace</b> has a {{great deal}} of special {{characteristics}} such as big capacity, long lag and non-linear trait, etc. In order to control it better, we present a sort of fuzzy neural network temperature control model. It can transform the rulers of fuzzy logic control to a pair of input-output samples of multilayer forward neural network. The knowledge is not expressed by a serial of rules but distributed into the whole network. Based on this model, we have designed a two-stage fuzzy neural network temperature control system for industrial <b>heating</b> <b>furnace.</b> The first-stage controller is responsible for determining the control variable according to deviation information of controlled variable. The second-stage controller takes charges of adjusting the control variable coming from the first-stage controller through other process parameters. The system takes full account of the impact of many process parameters on controlled variable. It uses two-stage fuzzy neural network controller to decentralize process of control parameters, which makes it easy to extract fuzzy rules, greatly reduces the number of fuzzy rules and produces reasonable control outputs. Engineering applications show that the system has a lot of advantages such as high accuracy, strong robustness, etc. Its quality is superior to conventional control and it is suitable for long lag, non-linear system in particular.
