25|$|Stephenson's novel REAMDE was {{released}} on September 20, 2011. The title is a play on the common filename <b>README.</b> This thriller, set in the present, centers around a group of MMORPG developers {{caught in the middle}} of Chinese cyber-criminals, Islamic terrorists, and Russian mafia.|$|E
25|$|As {{stated in}} the <b>readme</b> file {{accompanying}} Sandbox, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition or Windows Vista x64 are the only officially supported operating systems for running the editor. According to Crytek, using a 32-bit OS can lead to instabilities with production size levels due to the low amount of virtual memory available and is therefore not supported.|$|E
25|$|The first limited demo of Flight Simulator X was {{released}} to the public on August 9, 2006, and available for download on the website. Although playable, the August demo represented a beta release of the product and had a number of bugs, some of which were recognized in the official installation's <b>README</b> file. On October 2, 2006, the demo was superseded by a newer release which, while having fewer bugs, is almost identical to the first demo. The DHC-2 Beaver was removed in favor of a Learjet 45. Both versions featured Princess Juliana International Airport on St. Maarten and the surrounding area only as opposed to the entire world.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the precise}} {{meaning of the}} title's three-letter acronym is never {{revealed}} during the game, the gaming press and fans adopted Murder, Death, Kill, which was coined as a neologism in the 1993 film Demolition Man. Another possibility is documented in the game manual, where Kurt's mission is named [...] "Mission: Deliver Kindness". It could also stand for the first initials of the game's characters; Max, Dr. Hawkins, and Kurt. In the <b>README</b> for the PC version of the game, it is stated [...] "It stands for whatever we say it stands for on any given day; i.e., today it stands for Mother's Day Kisses." [...] In the European PC release, the background images during installation present many possible meanings for the letters; {{one of which is}} [...] "Murder, Death, Kill". In the Japanese release, on the back cover it says in bold yellow letters: [...] "My Dear Knight". During the installation of MDK2, various meanings are shown, again including [...] "Murder, Death, Kill". The original meaning of [...] "MDK" [...] from the company's initial promo video was in fact [...] "Murder Death Kill". In a 2009 interview with NowGamer, David Perry revealed that because the North American publisher PIE was supposed to make toys based on the game, they did not like the title, so the words were removed and simply replaced with [...] "MDK".|$|E
