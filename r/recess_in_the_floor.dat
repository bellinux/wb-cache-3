50|$|Cave 13 {{contains}} a large figure of Nārāyaṇa, the recumbent figure of Viṣṇu resting. Before the niche are two shallow <b>recess</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> These received pillar bases {{for some sort}} of porch. There is a shallow vertical recess above the cave, matched by a similar recess in the opposite cliff face, suggesting that {{there was some sort of}} architectural curtain wall across the passage at this point. The cave has received a modern in screen, a great disfigurement.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the episode, Abe watches his idol Ben Matlock talk to a crowd of excited seniors at the Grand Opening of the Center for Geriatric Medicine. Ben Matlock is a character from the NBC/ABC television series Matlock, portrayed by Andy Griffith and created by Dean Hargrove. The crowd cheer for Matlock by singing a slightly changed version of the [...] "We Love You, Conrad" [...] song from stage musical Bye Bye Birdie. Homer dances on giant piano keys <b>recessed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> toy store, spoofing a scene from the 1988 film Big. Lisa wants Lisa Lionheart to have [...] "the wisdom of Gertrude Stein, the wit of Cathy Guisewite, the tenacity of Nina Totenberg, the common sense of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and the down-to-earth good looks of Eleanor Roosevelt." ...|$|R

50|$|The Lars Petterson-Fred Gurney Three-Decker is a {{historic}} triple decker house at 2 Harlow Street <b>in</b> Worcester, Massachusetts. <b>The</b> house was built c. 1910 by Lars Petterson, a local builder who developed {{a number of other}} properties in Worcester. It has Colonial Revival styling, including a <b>recessed</b> porch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third <b>floor</b> under <b>the</b> gambrel roof, with first and second-floor porches below supported by square columns. The roof has large gambrel-roof dormers on the sides, and a modillioned cornice.|$|R
50|$|Different stadiums were {{released}} in different markets. TakaraTomy and Sonokong used Beystadiums {{similar to those}} featured <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anime, with open sections <b>in</b> <b>the</b> walls and openings on the sides to launch into, while Hasbro designed new stadiums with high walls and pockets that counted as a ring-out instead. Common features of a Beystadium include a shallow impression called a cyclone ridge, which allows Attack type Beyblades to move around quickly without accidentally knocking themselves out, and cyclone points, which are <b>recessed</b> disks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stadium <b>floor</b> that spin freely to add randomness to a battle.|$|R
40|$|The Red Kangaroo, Macropus rufus, is a {{specialist}} inhabitant of the hot, arid interior of Australia. Physiological adaptations that {{enable it to}} survive in this extreme environment are not fully understood, but include modifications of the kidney to optimize water economy {{and the ability to}} reabsorb water from digesta. To date, no nasal adaptations have been revealed in M. rufus, even though specializations in this region for thermoregulation and water conservation are common in arid-zone placental mammals, such as camels. Here, we investigate the nasal osteology and histology of M. rufus and describe two previously unreported features. Computed-tomographic scans reveal two modifications of <b>the</b> premaxillae <b>in</b> adult M. rufus: a sulcus on the inner margin of lateral walls of the nasal cavity, and a longitudinal <b>recess</b> lying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> nasal cavity. Histological analysis shows that these are lined with simple respiratory epithelia; no additional glandular structures were evident. The submucosa of the lateral sulcus was highly vascular, suggesting a role <b>in</b> thermoregulation. <b>The</b> lamina propria of the ventral recess was relatively avascular, but contains lymphatic vessels. Presence of <b>the</b> lateral sulcus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tropical Antilopine Kangaroo, M. antilopinus, and absence of either feature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> more mesic-adapted grey kangaroos (M. fuliginosus, M. giganteus), lends support to the hypothesis that this premaxillary modification may reflect adaptation of the nasal cavity for thermoregulation. The ventral nasal recess was unique to M. rufus and we suggest that it {{may play a role in}} water conservation in this species via reclamation of moisture by the lymphatic system. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of a nasal mechanism for water reclamation in mammals...|$|R
