5|$|Kirkpatrick Chapel {{was named}} {{in honour of}} Sophia Astley Kirkpatrick. Kirkpatrick was the wife of Littleton Kirkpatrick, a local {{attorney}} and politician {{who was a member}} of the board of trustees of Rutgers College from 1841 until his death in 1859. When Sophia Kirkpatrick died in 1871, Rutgers was named as the <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee</b> of her estate. A bequest of $61,054.57 (2013: US$1,174,079.38) from her estate funded the construction of the chapel. According to Rutgers, this marked the first time in New Jersey history that an institution became a direct heir to an estate.|$|E
5|$|When Sophia Astley Kirkpatrick (1802–1871) died on March 6, 1871 {{at the age}} of 68, {{she named}} Rutgers College as her estate's <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee.</b> At that time, Rutgers was a small, private liberal arts college in New Brunswick, New Jersey, {{affiliated}} with the Dutch Reformed faith. Founded in 1766 as Queen’s College, Rutgers is the eighth-oldest institution of higher education established in the United States. It was one of nine colleges founded in the American colonies before the Revolutionary War. Rutgers' website states that this bequest from Sophia Kirkpatrick's will {{was the first time in}} New Jersey legal history that an institution became a direct heir to an estate.|$|E
25|$|Administration cum testamento annexo, {{where the}} {{deceased}} {{has left a}} will but has appointed no executor to it, or the executor appointed has died or refuses to act. In this case the court will make the grant to the person, usually the <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee,</b> with the largest beneficial interest in the estate.|$|E
50|$|He married Frances Susannah, {{youngest}} daughter of Samuel Lovick Cooper and widow of Frederick Tyrrell, but left no issue. By his will he appointed his brother Henry, barrister-at-law, and his nephew Francis, <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees.</b>|$|R
50|$|Caxaro was {{certainly}} {{a good friend of}} some of these men, both for intellectual as well as personal reasons. The fact that he designated the Dominicans as his general inheritors, or <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees,</b> in his will is proof enough of this.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{there it}} is, you see, there it is," [...] said Mr. Trumbull, significantly. [...] "It can't be denied that undeserving {{people have been}} <b>legatees,</b> and even <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees.</b> It is so, with {{testamentary}} dispositions." [...] Again he pursed up his lips and frowned a little.|$|R
25|$|Adoption {{had to be}} with {{consent of}} the natural parents, who usually {{executed}} a deed making over the child, who thus ceased to have any claim upon them. But vestals, hierodules, certain palace officials and slaves had no rights over their children and could raise no objection. Orphans and illegitimate children had no parents to object. Ingratitude by adopted children was severely frowned on by the law: if the adopted child of a prostitute abandoned his foster parents {{and returned to his}} biological father's house, his eye was torn out. If an adopted child rejected his foster parents, claiming they were not his mother and father, his tongue was torn out. An adopted child was a full heir; the contract might even assign him the position of eldest son. Usually, he was <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee.</b>|$|E
500|$|Though, {{according}} to acquaintances, {{many of his}} friends had heard nothing from him since his departure for Tahiti, his will made provision for a scholarship at Magdalene and named the college as his <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee.</b> His literary assets at death were valued at £5,007. Though Keable received a Protestant burial in Papeete, some accounts suggest {{that in the last}} weeks of his life he formally converted to Catholicism. Other commentators suggest the pagan sentiments he expressed about the birth of his new son as a riposte to social convention tend to indicate otherwise. Hugh Cecil argues that, at his death, Keable most likely just became [...] "able to reconcile his two ideals, romantic-erotic and religious, and could die peacefully accepting the rituals he loved." ...|$|E
500|$|Since {{allowing}} the {{trustee of the}} will to retain the property {{is at the heart}} of the [...] "fraud", it is not clear why courts have considered the appropriate remedy to recognise a trust on behalf of others, rather than a resulting trust in favour of the estate (the <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee).</b> To this it has been argued that, since the testator is dead, a resulting trust is often reversing the beneficiary's claims since the testator cannot make any attempt to revoke or undo the trust terms. Save in case of a will and except the plain reading of clauses within the will, having admitted external evidence as operating under the proper introduction of the doctrine of incorporation by reference, a conclusive claim that it is necessary to observe further the formality requirement cannot be disregarded, because Will Act clearly set out the requirements of property transfer in case of failure has to be based on result trust that a party ultimately intended. The enforcement of the secret trust as a response to perceived fraud also opens the door to a further form of deceit, whereby the trustee funnels the trust monies to the wrong beneficiary. In light of evidential burden of proof, when establishing the identity of the secret beneficiary, ...|$|E
25|$|Chapman (otherwise Mr Lawrence) was {{probably}} disappointed when his brother Francis died unmarried in 1915, leaving him only £25,000 of his estate of £120,296, with £10,000 {{going to the}} Adelaide Hospital in Dublin and £25,000 being shared by Chapman's four daughters, who were also the <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees.</b> When Chapman (Lawrence) received the £25,000, he shared part of it out among his sons.|$|R
5000|$|Tooley {{witnessed}} Richard Burbage's will in 1619. In his {{own will}} of 3 June 1623, Tooley names Henry Condell and Cuthbert Burbage as his executors and <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees.</b> The bequests in Tooley's will are interesting {{for the light}} they throw on the actors of the King's Men, and the close relationship Tooley shared with the Burbage family. Those bequests include: ...|$|R
60|$|Now, Ahab and {{his three}} mates formed what may be called the first table in the Pequod's cabin. After their departure, taking place in {{inverted}} order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees.</b> They made a sort of temporary servants' hall of the high and mighty cabin.|$|R
500|$|Two further {{problems}} are apparent {{when considering the}} fraud theory {{in the context of}} half-secret trusts. Since the will mentions the trust, it is impossible for the trustee to deny the existence of the trust. Whether or not the intended beneficiaries can be ascertained, in case of inter vivo transaction, the trust-beneficiary cannot benefit personally and any meaning of fraud seems apparent because fraud requires an intention to act dishonestly. It appears to create an alternative route: the trustee may bring false oral testimony in favour of a third party who was not the intended beneficiary, a party that cannot benefit if the law did not uphold half-secret trusts in conclusion but it could operate without court's interference. Secondly, a half-secret trust ought to fail for uncertainty, being a trust with no terms, with a resulting trust to the <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee.</b> Under the rule of three uncertainties in private trust, half or fully secretly trust ought to fail because of lack of intentional element. Those in favour of its enforcement must therefore observe the imposition of resulting trust as required under three certainties rule, and the [...] "fraud" [...] theory seems insufficient to do so, since there is no sublet and significant impact for dishonest act and if otherwise fraud can be upheld; and therefore no conduct {{on the part of the}} trustee to warrant it. The deceased's intended disposition remains imperfectly constituted and the intended beneficiary's claim is thus weaker than the residuary legatee's. Whilst one response has been to suggest that whether a resulting trust or enforcement of the secret trust is most appropriate remedy is a question for the courts, subsequent cases have typically defined the automatic resulting trust, as in this case, as operating as a matter of law and not a question for the courts, and this should be settled by parliament legislation.|$|E
500|$|Since my {{work was}} announced, several Lives and Memoirs of Dr. Johnson have been published, the most voluminous {{of which is}} one {{compiled}} for the booksellers of London, by Sir John Hawkins, Knight, a man, whom, during my long intimacy with Dr. Johnson, I never saw in his company, I think but once, and I am sure not above twice. Johnson might have esteemed him for his decent, religious demeanour, and his knowledge of books and literary history; but from the rigid formalities of his manners, {{it is evident that}} they never could have lived together with companionable ease and familiarity; nor had Sir John Hawkins that nice perception which was necessary to mark the finer and less obvious parts of Johnson's character. His being appointed one of his executors, gave him an opportunity of taking possession of such fragments of a diary and other papers as were left; of which, before delivering them up to the <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee,</b> whose property they were, he endeavoured to extract the substance. In this he has not been very successful, as I have found upon a perusal of those papers, which have been since transferred to me. Sir John Hawkins's ponderous labours, I must acknowledge, exhibit a farrago, of which a considerable portion is not devoid of entertainment to the lovers of literary gossipping; but besides its being swelled out with long unnecessary extracts from various works, (even one of several leaves from Osborne's Harleian Catalogue, and those not compiled by Johnson, but by Oldys,) a very small part of it relates to the person who is the subject of the book; and, in that, there is such an inaccuracy in the statement of facts, as in so solemn an authour is hardly excusable, and certainly makes his narrative very unsatisfactory. But what is still worse, there is throughout the whole of it a dark uncharitable cast, by which the most unfavourable construction is put upon almost every circumstance in the character and conduct of my illustrious friend; who, I trust, will, be a true and fair delineation, be vindicated both from the injurious misrepresentation of this authour, and from the slighter aspersions of a lady who once lived in great intimacy with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Sophia Astley Kirkpatrick died in 1871, {{she left}} named Rutgers College as the <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee</b> of her estate. The college's {{trustees}} decided to appropriate {{most of the}} bequest to fund {{the construction of a}} chapel. The chapel was designed by Henry Janeway Hardenbergh at the beginning his career, and in the third of three projects for the college. [...] Hardenbergh employed the High Victorian Gothic Revival style—and in particular features common to fourteenth-century German and English Gothic churches—popular at {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century.|$|E
50|$|A {{testator}} gave £12,000 in a codicil to {{five people}} on trust, saying they should invest using their discretion and ‘to apply the income.... {{for the purposes}} indicated by me to them.’ Four were told the general objects, and the fifth got detailed instructions. All accepted. The fifth also made a memorandum of the testator’s instructions, but {{a few hours after}} the codicil was executed. The <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees</b> claimed that any trust was invalid, because parol evidence was inadmissible to establish the testator’s purposes.|$|R
50|$|Daniel Wright Vautier then {{attained}} twenty-one in {{the month}} of March 1841, and {{as he was about to}} be married, he presented a petition for the trustees to be ordered to transfer to him the East India stock, or it be sold and the proceeds transferred to him. His application came before the Master of the Rolls, who on becoming aware of the earlier order dated 25 July 1835 remitted it to the Lord Chancellor for hearing to enable other <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees</b> to present an appeal petition from that order to the Lord Chancellor.|$|R
50|$|If a {{testamentary}} trust fails, the property usually {{will be held}} on resulting trusts for the testator's residuary estate. Some famous English trust law cases were on behalf of the <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees</b> under a will seeking to have {{testamentary trust}}s declared void so as to inherit the trust property. An infamous example is Re Diplock 1941 Ch 253, which resulted in the suicide of one of the trustees who was personally liable to account for trust funds that had been disbursed for what he thought were perfectly valid charitable trusts).|$|R
2500|$|Sidaway had a {{de facto}} spouse, {{by the name of}} Mary Marshall (d. 1849). Marshall had been sentenced to {{transportation}} for life at the Old Bailey on 23 February 1785 and had arrived in the First Fleet in the Lady Penrhyn. Sidaway died on 13 October 1809, described by the Sydney Gazette as a philanthropist and a respected member of society. [...] Mary Marshall was granted administratrix of all of Sidaway's land and effects. As Sidaway's <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee,</b> she sent Governor Macquarie a memorial applying for a renewal of the lease on Sidaway's property in Sydney, but this was refused. She continued in Sydney as a publican.|$|E
2500|$|To Head, {{ever the}} scientist, the illness was his [...] "second {{personal}} experiment" [...] and he described its progress as thoroughly as the first. His final wish was to aid 'the {{purpose of the}} advancement in England of the science of medicine in the widest sense' with the Royal Society as <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee.</b> He had led a productive life {{and he had been}} rewarded with many honours for his art of science. Granted membership and, in 1900, fellowship to the Royal College of Physicians, [...] he was also elected as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1899 and was to be given a role on the council, a silver Royal Medal and a vice-presidency in turn. Knighted in 1927 he was also to be granted an Honorary Fellowship at his Alma Mater, Trinity College, in 1929. All of this well-deserved recognition for a man who, had his headmaster had his way, would never have completed his education.|$|E

By the way, {{there seems to be no}} mention in the will of a <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee.</b> Ernest, my boy, we may have to fight over that." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{family of}} Lees of Barna, Tipperary, claimed descent from Cromwell Lee, and {{according}} to Chambers {{this may have been}} through an illegitimate son, Robert Lee of New Woodstock, son of Cromwell's servant, Joan Hopkins alias Hatton. In his will he left Joan some kine and household goods at Cutteslowe, to her daughter Alice a marriage portion of £10, and to Robert his household furniture and his leases from Merton College. He made Joan and Robert his <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees.</b> She later married one Thomas Aylwin or Ayleward of Eversley, a witness to the will.|$|R
50|$|After lodging a {{liquidation}} {{and distribution}} account to which {{there has been}} no objection, or any objections made have been overruled by the court, the executor must distribute the balance of the assets to the beneficiaries. Where there is no will, the assets are distributed among the heirs according to the rules of intestate succession; where there is a will, the assets are distributed according to the provisions of that will. In the latter case, the legacies are paid or distributed first, the balance going to the heirs; the consequence is that the heirs are in effect <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees.</b>|$|R
500|$|The cy-près {{doctrine}} {{applies to}} {{two types of}} situations: subsequent failures and initial failures.

The courts instead simply {{determine whether or not}} the reason for failure falls within Section 13, based on the basic intention underlying the original gift.|$|R
60|$|After Coningsby's {{visit to}} the Castle in 1836 a very {{important}} change occurred in the disposition of Lord Monmouth's estate.

"I {{have given}} a {{judgment}} for the <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee</b> under the will," [...] said the Court, [...] "put the costs upon the contestants, decided all questions relating to fees and other charges; and, in short, the estate in litigation has been settled, with all controversies, disputes, misunderstandings, and differences of opinion thereunto appertaining." ...|$|E

[...] Due to the debts, a protracted lawsuit ensued and {{a large part of the}} estate was lost in the legal costs. It was widely reported that she had made it a condition of the inheritance that her executors publish all her correspondence with Swift, but in fact no such stipulation seems to have been made.|$|R

50|$|He adopted {{literature}} as his profession, {{and although he}} was called to {{the bar at the}} Inner Temple, on 5 May 1809, he did not meet with sufficient success to abandon his pen. He was a regular contributor to various periodicals, and especially to the Morning Chronicle under Perry. Art notices, dramatic criticisms, and verses on the topics of the day were his principal contributions; and to the last day of his life he retained his position of art critic on the staff of The Observer.

60|$|Mr Podsnap {{inquires}} {{what would}} become of the very large fortune, {{in the event of}} the marriage condition not being fulfilled?

6000|$|... "So I did. That is {{the amount}} of the fortune left by the {{eccentric}} old hospital-for-incurables founder. When poor Hardy made out his will he made me <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee</b> because the trifle he had to leave--his kit, etcetera,--was not worth dividing between me and Armstrong. If it had been worth much he would have divided it. It is therefore my duty now to divide it with my friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was still}} a residue of {{personal}} property {{as well as the}} land, but the whole was left to one person, and that person was--O possibilities! O expectations founded on the favor of [...] "close" [...] old gentlemen! O endless vocatives that would still leave expression slipping helpless from the measurement of mortal folly!--that <b>residuary</b> <b>legatee</b> was Joshua Rigg, who was also sole executor, and who was to take thenceforth the name of Featherstone.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his will}} he made three friends, Peter Finley Dunne, Harry Payne Whitney, and Francis Patrick Garvan, the <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees</b> of his estate and, thus, his {{publishing}} company. Collier evidently believed {{that his wife}} had sufficient money of her own. In fact, she did not and would receive only a few thousand dollar from her husband's will. Dunne, Whitney, and Garvan then renounced the bequest so that Mrs. Collier could benefit fully. [...] In addition to selling the troubled publishing company, his wife donated their home in the Wickatunk section of Marlboro Township, New Jersey to the Sisters of the Good Shepherd who made it a home for troubled young women. This was later opened up to children of all ages and what has become known as Collier High School.|$|R

Lord Monmouth's trustee and executor! 'You know you are my executor.' Sublime truth! It ought to be blazoned in letters of gold in the most conspicuous part of Rigby's library, to remind him perpetually of his great and impending destiny. Lord Monmouth's executor, and very probably one of his <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees!</b> A legatee of some sort he knew he was. What a splendid memento mori! What cared Rigby for the borough of Darlford? And as for his political friends, he wished them joy of their barren benches. Nothing was lost by not being in this Parliament.|$|R
2500|$|Chapman had a sister, Caroline Margaret Chapman, who in 1894 {{married her}} cousin, Montagu Chapman, later the fifth Chapman baronet, and Sir Montagu died childless in 1907. In 1911, his widow made a Will which divided the Killua estate, leaving £20,000 to her brother, Chapman, and {{separate}} large amounts to his four daughters. However, {{when she died}} in 1920, the £20,000 went to the daughters, as her <b>residuary</b> <b>legatees,</b> as Chapman had himself died {{a few months before}} and she had not specified that the bequest was to go elsewhere in that event. The loss of the £20,000 may explain the bitterness of an allusion to the Chapmans which T. E. Lawrence added to Liddell Hart's biography of him: [...] "The father's family seemed unconscious of his sons, even when after his death recognition of their achievement might have done honour to the name." ...|$|R
