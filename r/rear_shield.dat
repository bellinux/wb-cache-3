In a previous study (Internal Note 95 - 12 DIM), simulations showed that a thick tungstene beam shielding (and a C+W absorber) reduces background {{at a level of}} some 0. 01 hits/cm 2 on the first chambers. But the price of this shielding and the still too high beackground led to new studies about the beam shielding.

Simulations showed that these three "exotic" shapes reduce the background by a factor of 1. 5 to 2 compared to the "standard" geometry of the beam shielding. These new geometries decrease the amount of materials and allow the replacement of a part of the expensive tungstene by lead.

Interrogation of the network was performed to identify the input parameters that most heavily correlated with the output prediction. Although {{the majority of the}} traditional parameters (i. e. those identified in the empirical ballistic limit equation) were amongst the most influential, some unexpected (and potentially spurious) parameters were also identified.

Failure limits in the shatter regime {{are based on a}} linear interpolation between the onset of projectile fragmentation, and impulsive rupture of the <b>shield</b> <b>rear</b> wall. A series of hypervelocity impact tests have been performed on aluminum alloy Whipple shields to investigate failure mechanisms and performance limits in the shatter regime. Test results demonstrated a more rapid increase in performance than predicted by the latest iteration of the JSC Whipple shield BLE following the onset of projectile fragmentation. This increase in performance was found to level out between 4. 0 - 5. 0 km/s, with a subsequent decrease in performance for velocities up to 6. 0 km/s. For a detached spall failure criterion, the failure limit was found to continually decrease up to a velocity of 7. 0 km/s, substantially varying from the BLE, while for perforation-based failure an increase in performance was observed. An existing phenomenological ballistic limit curve was found to provide a more accurate reproduction of shield behavior that the BLE, however a number of underlying assumptions such as the occurrence of complete projectile fragmentation and the effect on performance of incipient projectile melt were found to be inaccurate. A cratering relationship based on the largest residual fragment size has been derived for application at velocities between 3. 0 - 4. 0 km/s, and was shown to accurately reproduce the trends of the experimental data. Further investigation is required to allow a full analytical description of shatter regime performance for metallic Whipple shields...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of honeycomb cells in a dual-wall structure is advantageous for mechanical performance and low weight in spacecraft primary structures but detrimental for shielding against impact of micrometeoroid and orbital debris particles (MMOD).

The Multipurpose Laboratory Module (MLM) is a Russian research module scheduled for launch and ISS assembly in 2011 (currently under review). Baseline shielding of the MLM is expected to be predominantly {{similar to that of the}} existing Functional Energy Block (FGB), utilizing a baseline triple wall configuration with honeycomb sandwich panels for the dual bumpers and a thick monolithic aluminum pressure wall. The MLM module is to be docked to the nadir port of the Zvezda service module and, as such, is subject to higher debris flux than the FGB module (which is aligned along the ISS flight vector). Without upgrades to inherited shielding, the MLM penetration risk is expected to be significantly higher than that of the FGB module. Open-cell foam represents a promising alternative to honeycomb as a sandwich panel core material in spacecraft primary structures as it provides comparable mechanical performance with a minimal increase in weight while avoiding structural features (i. e. channeling cells) detrimental to MMOD shielding performance. In this study, the effect of replacing honeycomb sandwich panel structures with metallic open-cell foam structures on MMOD shielding performance is assessed for an MLM-representative configuration. A number of hypervelocity impact tests have been performed on both the baseline honeycomb configuration and upgraded foam configuration, and differences in target damage, failure limits, and derived ballistic limit equations are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{presence}} of a honeycomb core in a multi-wall shielding configuration for protection against micrometeoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) particle impacts at hypervelocity is {{generally considered to be}} detrimental as the cell walls act to restrict fragment cloud expansion, creating a more concentrated load on the <b>shield</b> <b>rear</b> wall. However, mission requirements often prevent the inclusion of a dedicated MMOD shield, and as such, structural honeycomb sandwich panels are amongst the most prevalent shield types. Open cell metallic foams are a relatively new material with novel mechanical and thermal properties that have shown promising results in preliminary hypervelocity impact shielding evaluations. In this study, an ISS-representative MMOD shielding configuration has been modified to evaluate the potential performance enhancement gained through the substitution of honeycomb for open cell foam. The baseline shielding configuration consists of a double mesh outer layer, two honeycomb sandwich panels, and an aluminum rear wall. In the modified configuration the two honeycomb cores are replaced by open-cell foam. To compensate for the heavier core material, facesheets have been removed from the second sandwich panel in the modified configuration. A total of 19 tests on the double layer honeycomb and double layer foam configurations are reported. For comparable mechanical and thermal performance, the foam modifications were shown to provide a 15 % improvement in critical projectile diameter at low velocities (i. e. 3 km/s) and a 3 % increase at high velocities (i. e. 7 km/s) for normal impact. With increasing obliquity, the performance enhancement was predicted to increase, up to a 29 % improvement at 60 (low velocity). Ballistic limit equations have been developed for the new configuration, and consider the mass of each individual shield component in order to maintain validity in the event of minor configuration modifications. Previously identified weaknesses of open cell foams for hypervelocity impact shielding such as large projectile diameters, low velocities, and high degrees of impact obliquity have all been investigated, and found to be negligible for the double-layer configuration...|$|R
5000|$|According to Honda, [...] "Engineers {{started with}} Honda’s Global Light Truck {{platform}} and transformed 93% {{of the components}} into a mission-specific platform with seven high-strength steel cross members that create a fully boxed ladder frame that was fully integrated into a unique unibody design. Further differentiation included a unique suspension design with custom components, 100% unique sheetmetal and a 95% exclusive interior." [...] The steel-reinforced fully boxed ladder-like unibody frame with its [...] "four-bone" [...] design and four-wheel independent suspension provided space for designers to build unique storage solutions in, around, {{and on top of}} the frame. Starting {{at the front of the}} Ridgeline, engineers crafted a hood that supported a unique cold air intake system for the engine that draws outside air from above and in front of the radiator to support torque production and deep water fording. This hood design also allowed engineers to build environmentally protected windshield wipers that were also heated to improve winter performance. [...] Honda also incorporated large side-view mirrors to support better visibility while towing; due to the mirrors’ size, Honda built small vortex generators on top of the mirrors to help reduce air turbulence. [...] In the crew-cab, the unibody frame allowed engineers to build a cabin with a flat load floor (i.e. no transmission hump) and more passenger space than other mid-size trucks. [...] At the center of the truck, the C-pillar's unique shape was specifically designed to help distribute large loads across the unibody frame and the cab so the truck could achieve its targeted payload and towing figures. [...] Also, the design of the C-pillar, rear roof garnish, and tailgate were built to maintain good aerodynamics and reduce turbulence between the cab and the tailgate while maintaining driver visibility. This aerodynamic design allowed them to create a <b>rear</b> garnish that <b>shields</b> the <b>rear</b> glass window so when it's opened at speed there is no buffeting or rainwater intrusion. [...] The bed is built out of steel-reinforced Sheet Molding Composite (SMC) which is dent resistant, corrosion resistant, and is covered with a non-slip coating. It is supported by high strength steel-reinforced crossmembers (three under the bed and two in the rear cab wall) to safely secure and support loads, even under conditions that would cause the SMC to fail.|$|R
2500|$|According to Honda, [...] "Engineers {{started with}} Honda’s Global Light Truck {{platform}} and transformed 93% {{of the components}} into a mission-specific platform using approximately 44% high-strength steel across the unibody and seven high-strength steel cross members to create a fully boxed ladder frame that is fully integrated into the unibody. [...] Further differentiation included a unique suspension design with custom components, 100% unique sheetmetal and a 95% exclusive interior." [...] According to Autoweek, The Ridgeline's [...] "unibody has many braces, brackets, and reinforced areas that require more welding than traditional pickups." [...] The steel-reinforced fully boxed ladder-like unibody frame with its [...] "four-bone" [...] design and four-wheel independent suspension provided space for designers to build unique storage solutions in, around, {{and on top of}} the frame. Starting {{at the front of the}} Ridgeline, engineers crafted an aluminum hood that supports a unique cold air intake system for the engine that draws outside air from above and in front of the radiator to support torque production and deep water fording which Honda attempted to patent. [...] This hood design also allowed engineers to build environmentally protected windshield wipers that are also heated to improve winter performance. [...] Honda also incorporated large side-view mirrors to support better visibility while towing; due to their size, Honda incorporated small vortex generators on top of the mirrors to reduce air turbulence which Honda also attempted to patent. [...] In the crew-cab, the unibody frame allowed engineers to build a cabin with a flat load floor (i.e. no transmission hump) and more passenger space than other mid-size trucks. [...] At the center of the truck, the C-pillar's unique shape was specifically designed to help distribute large loads across the unibody frame and the cab so the truck could achieve its targeted payload and towing figures. [...] Also, the design of the C-pillar, rear roof garnish, and tailgate were built to maintain good aerodynamics and reduce turbulence between the cab and the tailgate while maintaining driver visibility. [...] This aerodynamic design allowed them to create a <b>rear</b> garnish that <b>shields</b> the <b>rear</b> glass window so when it's opened at speed there is no buffeting or rainwater intrusion.

[...] It is supported by high-strength steel crossmembers (three under the bed and two in the rear cab wall) to safely secure and support heavy loads, even under conditions that would cause the SMC to fail or during collisions that would try to force that load into the cab.|$|R
50|$|By 18 November, the II Corps {{held the}} {{northern}} part and the VIII Corps held {{the south side of}} the salient. Brigadier-General C. F. Aspinall, the Brigadier-General General Staff (BGGS) of VIII Corps, wrote a report describing the vulnerability of the position and its approaches to German artillery. Aspinall estimated that repairing the transport routes and keeping them open despite German bombardments, would take eight labour battalions when VIII Corps had only three. Aspinall considered that the morale effect of holding the village after such an effort by both sides was considerable, that parts of the <b>rear</b> area were <b>shielded</b> from German observers and it would be a good jumping-off position for an offensive towards Westroosebeke or the Lys valley but that its positions lacked observation to the north and north-east. Remaining in the salient would mean that the Germans could continue bombard the defenders from an arc of 240°, reinforcements had no cover and supplies had to be carried forward a great distance. It would be easy for the Germans to prevent troops moving into the salient and they could smother the area with artillery-fire, guaranteeing a constant drain of casualties. Because the salient needed an excessive amount of artillery, the crews would have little rest, being so vulnerable to flanking-fire and the infantry holding the area would be too worn out to fight in a spring offensive. Aspinall recommended that unless there was another offensive in early 1918, the British should withdraw about 8000 yd, to a line from Westhoek along Pilckem Ridge to the north. A retirement should not be delayed until a German attack, because much of the artillery would be lost but rather be a surprise as soon as the new front line was ready. Despite the gloomy prognosis, Rawlinson decided that the army should remain on the ridge. Teall Cottage was captured on the night of 21/22 November and on the night of 24/25 November two battalions of the 8th Division attacked without artillery support and advanced the line to the ridge crest, which increased the depth of observation into the German lines by 400 yd. A German counter-attack on the 8th Division front at 6:00 a.m. on 30 November was anticipated and was repulsed, with many German casualties inflicted by British small-arms fire and a prompt artillery barrage. Teall Cottage, having been transferred from the 8th Division to the 32nd Division area on 24/25 November, was recaptured and a British counter-attack on the cottage before dawn on 1 December failed, with 102 casualties.|$|R
