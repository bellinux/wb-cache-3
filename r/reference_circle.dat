The minimum zone tolerance (MZT) approach provides the minimum roundness error, i. e. the minimum distance between the two concentric <b>reference</b> <b>circles</b> containing the acquired profile; more accurate form error estimation results in less false part rejections. MZT is still an open problem and is approached here by a Genetic Algorithm. Only few authors have addressed the definition of the search space center and size and its relationship with the dataset size, which greatly influence the inspection time for the profile measurement and the convergence speed of the roundness estimation algorithm for a given target accuracy. Experimental tests on certified roundness profiles, using the profile centroid as the search space center, have shown that the search space size is related to the number of dataset points and an optimum exists, which provides a computation time reduction up to an order of magnitude...|$|R
40|$|Clustering is an {{efficient}} approach in a {{wireless sensor network}} (WSN) to reduce the energy consumption of nodes and to extend the lifetime of the network. Unfortunately, this approach requires that all cluster heads (CHs) transmit their data to the base station (BS), which {{gives rise to the}} long distance communications problem, and in multi-hop routing, the CHs near the BS have to forward data from other nodes that lead those CHs to die prematurely, creating the hot zones problem. Unequal clustering has been proposed to solve these problems. Most of the current algorithms elect CH only by considering their competition radius, leading to unevenly distributed cluster heads. Furthermore, global distances values are needed when calculating the competition radius, which is a tedious task in large networks. To face these problems, we propose a flooding tree uneven clustering protocol (FTUC) suited for large networks. Based on the construction of a tree type sub-network to calculate the minimum and maximum distances values of the network, we then apply the unequal cluster theory. We also introduce <b>referenced</b> position <b>circles</b> to evenly elect cluster heads. Therefore, cluster heads are elected depending on the node’s residual energy and their distance to a <b>referenced</b> <b>circle.</b> FTUC builds the best inter-cluster communications route by evaluating a cluster head cost function to find the best next hop to the BS. The simulation results show that the FTUC algorithm decreases the energy consumption of the nodes and balances the global energy consumption effectively, thus extending the lifetime of the network...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTwo {{different}} groups of subjects had to adjust two-dimensional stimuli, differing in size, shape and type (dot patterns or irregular contour figures), within a <b>reference</b> <b>circle.</b> The two groups performed under two different instructions. The first instruction stressed matching the centres of the stimulus and the circle, while the second required simply positioning the test stimulus {{in the middle of}} the <b>reference</b> <b>circle.</b> In two control experiments the subjects had to determine the position of the centres of each stimulus and of the <b>reference</b> <b>circle.</b> Under the first instruction the accuracy of performance, estimated by the variance of the responses, depended on the stimulus size, shape and type in agreement with previous results and models of relative localization. Under the second instruction, however, accuracy remained invariant. Possible mechanisms of relative localization that might differ at their first stages of localization of the separate stimuli are considered. Copyright © 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Filtration {{techniques}} are useful tools of analysing roundness profiles. The 2 RC filter and Gaussian filter {{are commonly used}} to assess peripheral undulations of the roundness data. However they cannot do every aspect of functional prediction. Morphological filters are employed to characterise roundness profiles for functional assessment. Traditional computation methods for morphological filters are limited to planar surfaces and unable to be extended to roundness measurement. A novel method based on alpha shape theory is developed {{to break up the}} confinement. The morphological closing and opening envelopes are obtained by rolling a disk upon the roundness profile from the air and material side of the component respectively. They can be used to identify significant peaks and valleys on the profile respectively, which are vital to the functional performance of component, especially contact phenomenon. A case study is presented that various options of morphological filters and <b>reference</b> <b>circles</b> are applied to a roundness profile, delivering different functional meanings. An in-depth comparison of morphological filters and the Gaussian filter is followed to derive their pros and cons...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a method}} to carry out optical interferometric measurements for the surface roughness of spheres in a biomedical application to an artificial joint, using two beams of a Michelson interferometric microscope with digital image processing and a computational system. There will be two kinds of microscopic interferograms formed from the interference between the measurement beams reflected from the artificial joint surface and the reference beams from the reference surface. One interferogram has equal circular interference fringes and another has localized arc interference fringes. To process these two interferograms by using a digital image processing system, the edges {{of each of the}} interference fringes which are modulated by the micro-structure of the artificial joint surface can be extracted. The paper proposes an algorithm for the calculation of the standard <b>reference</b> mean <b>circles</b> and mean curves from each of the fringe edges by using the least square fitting method and to obtain the profile departures from the <b>reference</b> mean <b>circles</b> and mean curves and the surface roughness parameters...|$|R

30|$|Forging {{spur gears}} {{are widely used}} in the driving system of mining {{machinery}} and equipment due to their higher strength and dimensional accuracy. For the purpose of precisely calculating the volume of cylindrical spur gear billet in cold precision forging, a new theoretical method named average circle method was put forward. With this method, a series of gear billet volumes were calculated. Comparing with the accurate three-dimensional modeling method, the accuracy of average circle method by theoretical calculation was estimated and the maximum relative error of average circle method was less than 1.5  %, which was in good agreement with the experimental results. Relative errors of the calculated and the experimental for obtaining the gear billet volumes with <b>reference</b> <b>circle</b> method are larger {{than those of the}} average circle method. It shows that average circle method possesses a higher calculation accuracy than <b>reference</b> <b>circle</b> method (traditional method), which should be worth popularizing widely in calculation of spur gear billet volume.|$|E

40|$|A large {{international}} effort {{is under way}} to assess {{the presence of a}} shadow in the radio emission from the compact source at the centre of our Galaxy, Sagittarius A$^*$ (Sgr A$^*$). If detected, this shadow would provide the first direct evidence of the existence of black holes and that Sgr A$^*$ is a supermassive black hole. In addition, the shape of the shadow could be used to learn about extreme gravity near the event horizon and to determine which theory of gravity better describes the observations. The mathematical description of the shadow has so far used a number of simplifying assumptions that are unlikely to be met by the real observational data. We here provide a general formalism to describe the shadow as an arbitrary polar curve expressed in terms of a Legendre expansion. Our formalism does not presume any knowledge of the properties of the shadow, e. g. the location of its centre, and offers a number of routes to characterize the distortions of the curve with respect to <b>reference</b> <b>circles.</b> These distortions can be implemented in a coordinate independent manner by different teams analysing the same data. We show that the new formalism provides an accurate and robust description of noisy observational data, with smaller error variances when compared to previous approaches for the measurement of the distortion.
