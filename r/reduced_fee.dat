25|$|The {{popularity}} of the film was unprecedented and cinemas played the film for longer runs than usual, often to packed houses, while some arranged additional screenings to meet demand. The film {{is thought to have}} achieved attendance figures of twenty million in its first six weeks of release. The film also attracted more middle-class audiences, some of whom had never been to a cinema before. William Jury, as the film's booking director, initially charged exhibitors £40, with the fee decreasing by £5 a week; after two months, a <b>reduced</b> <b>fee</b> of £6 for three nights put the film within the price range of village halls wishing to show the film. By October 1916, the film had been booked by more than two thousand cinemas in Britain, earning over £30,000.|$|E

500|$|Hitchcock {{insisted that}} Bernard Herrmann write the score for Psycho despite the composer's refusal {{to accept a}} <b>reduced</b> <b>fee</b> for the film's lower budget. The {{resulting}} score, according to Christopher Palmer in The Composer in Hollywood (1990) is [...] "perhaps Herrmann's most spectacular Hitchcock achievement." [...] Hitchcock {{was pleased with the}} tension and drama the score added to the film, later remarking [...] "33% of the effect of Psycho was due to the music." [...] The singular contribution of Herrmann's score may be inferred from the unusual penultimate placement of the composer's name in the film's opening credit sequence, as it is followed only by Hitchcock's directing credit.|$|E

Standard unlimited MetroCards are not accepted on AirTrain JFK.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Hands {{over the}} City, Steiger agreed {{to appear in}} another Italian film, Time of Indifference (1964), in which he starred {{opposite}} Claudia Cardinale and Shelley Winters. Though Steiger's powerful performance was unaffected, the production was marred by a dispute between director Francesco Maselli and producer Franco Cristaldi, with one wanting {{it to be a}} purely political film and the other wanting emphasis on the erotic subplot and his relationship with Cardinale. In Sidney Lumet's gritty drama The Pawnbroker (1964), Steiger played an embittered, emotionally withdrawn survivor of the Holocaust living in New York City. Richard Harland Smith of TCM notes that Steiger's career was waning at the time, and he had to [...] "scramble for paying gigs for a decade" [...] before getting this part. Steiger agreed to a <b>reduced</b> <b>fee</b> of $50,000. [...] He read Lumet's novel and the script many times to develop an intimate understanding of the character, and insisted on reducing his lines to make his character more realistic and alienated from society. Lumet noted that during the production Steiger had a tendency to be overly dramatic, stating: [...] "Sure, Rod has weaknesses of rhetoric, but you can talk them through with him. I explained that this solitary Jew could not rise to heights of emotion; he had been hammered by life and by people. The faith he had to find was in other people, because God had betrayed him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Building on {{an effort}} started in 2001 to {{increase}} scores by providing breakfast before tests, Balboa initiated a pilot breakfast program in 2005 called [...] "Grab N Go." [...] A first for Northern California, {{the program has}} {{increased the number of}} disadvantaged students receiving breakfast. Using magnetic swipe cards, eligible students can pick up a pre-bagged meal as they enter the building and can eat the meal during the first ten minutes of their first class. Previously, students would have to arrive up to 30 minutes before classes started and finish the meal in the cafeteria. Prior to 2001 participation in the free or <b>reduced</b> <b>fee</b> meal program averaged under 40% of eligible enrollment. Since the pilot program started, breakfast participation has averaged over 55%. Credited with increasing academic performance, the program was nominated by Nancy Pelosi for and subsequently received a Victory Against Hunger Award from the [...] in 2006. Balboa was one of four schools nationwide to receive part of a grant from the [...] campaign in March 2007 to support the program. Balboa has continued to serve subsidized lunch meals in a traditional two-tiered system. The social stratification caused by the separate lunch lines has attracted some criticism and efforts by the district to improve participation by eligible students.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the age of}} 13, Airy stayed {{frequently}} with his uncle, Arthur Biddell at Playford, Suffolk. Biddell introduced Airy to his friend Thomas Clarkson, the slave trade abolitionist who lived at Playford Hall. [...] Clarkson had an MA in mathematics from Cambridge, and examined Airy in classics and then subsequently arranged {{for him to be}} examined by a Fellow from Trinity College, Cambridge on his knowledge of mathematics. As a result, he entered Trinity in 1819, as a sizar, meaning that he paid a <b>reduced</b> <b>fee</b> but essentially worked as a servant to make good the fee reduction. Here he had a brilliant career, and seems to have been almost immediately recognised as the leading man of his year. In 1822 he was elected scholar of Trinity, and in the following year he graduated as senior wrangler and obtained first Smith's Prize. On 1 October 1824 he was elected fellow of Trinity, and in December 1826 was appointed Lucasian professor of mathematics in succession to Thomas Turton. This chair he held for little more than a year, being elected in February 1828 Plumian professor of astronomy and director of the new Cambridge Observatory. In 1836 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society and in 1840, a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1859 he became foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.|$|E
