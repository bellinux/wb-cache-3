5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent <b>remedial</b> <b>actions</b> to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Remedial</b> <b>actions.</b> These {{are usually}} {{long-term}} response actions. <b>Remedial</b> <b>actions</b> seek to permanently and {{significantly reduce the}} risks associated with releases or threats of releases of hazardous substances, and are generally larger more expensive actions. They can include measures such as using containment to prevent pollutants from migrating, and combinations of removing, treating, or neutralizing toxic substances. These actions can be conducted with federal funding only at sites listed on the EPA National Priorities List (NPL) in the United States and the territories. Remedial action by responsible parties under consent decrees or unilateral administrative orders with EPA oversight may be performed at both NPL and non-NPL sites, commonly called Superfund Alternative Sites in published EPA guidance and policy documents.|$|E

The UMTRA Project routinely monitors radiation, radioactive residual materials, and hazardous constituents at associated former uranium tailings processing sites and disposal sites. At {{the end of}} 1994, surface <b>remedial</b> <b>action</b> was complete at 14 of the 24 designated UMTRA Project processing sites: Canonsburg, Pennsylvania; Durango, Colorado; Grand Junction, Colorado; Green River Utah, Lakeview, Oregon; Lowman, Idaho; Mexican Hat, Utah; Riverton, Wyoming; Salt Lake City, Utah; Falls City, Texas; Shiprock, New Mexico; Spook, Wyoming, Tuba City, Arizona; and Monument Valley, Arizona. Surface <b>remedial</b> <b>action</b> was ongoing at 5 sites: Ambrosia Lake, New Mexico; Naturita, Colorado; Gunnison, Colorado; and Rifle, Colorado (2 sites). <b>Remedial</b> <b>action</b> has not begun at the 5 remaining UMTRA Project sites {{that are in the}} planning stage. Belfield and Bowman, North Dakota; Maybell, Colorado; and Slick Rock, Colorado (2 sites). The ground water compliance phase of the UMTRA Project started in 1991. Because the UMTRA Project sites are. ` different stages of <b>remedial</b> <b>action,</b> the breadth of the UMTRA environmental protection program differs from site to site. In general, sites actively undergoing surface <b>remedial</b> <b>action</b> have the most comprehensive environmental programs for sampling media.

In particular, the AMRO will, during peace time, conduct annual consultations with individual member economies and, on this basis, prepare quarterly consolidated reports on the macroeconomic assessment of the ASEAN+3 region and individual member countries.

500|$|The fishing {{industry}} on Dal {{is the second}} largest industry {{in the region and}} is central to many of the people's livelihoods who reside on the lake's periphery. Dal's commercial fisheries are particularly reliant on carp fish species, which were introduced into the lake in 1957. As a result, carp constitutes 70% of all the fish caught in the lake while the schizothonax constitutes 20% and other species account for 10%. Fishermen use a locally manufactured cast net which comprises six parts with a diameter of 6 metres. It is operated from a wooden fishing boat made out of deodar, typically 20ftx4ft in size. The gradual decline in quality of the lake water through pollution has resulted in lower fish stocks and the extinction of endemic varieties of fish. The causes for such deterioration have been identified and <b>remedial</b> <b>actions</b> have been initiated.The various fishing nets being used in Dal are cast net (Zaal/Duph), Long line (Walruz), Gill net (Pachi, Shaitan zaal), Rod and line (Bislai), Scoop net (Attha zaal) (Bhat et al., 2008) ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{addresses}} in {{turn the}} activities considered {{essential to the}} identification of properties {{in the vicinity of}} the designated inactive uranium mill tailings sites suspected of containing residual radioactive material; the radiological characterization of each property necessary to define the extent of contamination; and the analysis/evaluation of survey results against criteria established by or based on EPA Standards for <b>Remedial</b> <b>Action</b> at Inactive Processing Sites (40 CFR 192) to support elimination or inclusion of such properties in the <b>remedial</b> <b>action</b> program. The overall intent is to minimize the extent of radiological survey efforts required to determine if a property should be included in the Uranium Mill Tailings <b>Remedial</b> <b>Action</b> Program (UMTRAP) or eliminated from further consideration for <b>remedial</b> <b>action,</b> thus, relegating the more detailed radiological characterization work on properties included for <b>remedial</b> <b>action</b> to the engineering phase of the program.

500|$|General Commandant Superior Aubert, who {{had been}} so lenient towards Le Tacon, {{organised}} an internal army purge in parallel with the trials of the Criminal Commissions. Its objectives were to reassert control over the native armed forces in Tonkin by identifying, penalising, isolating, and re-educating disloyal troops, thereby setting an example to the others. According to Patrice Morlat, [...] "545 tirailleurs and warrant officers were the object of sanctions: 164 were transferred into disciplinary companies in Tonkin, 94 to Africa..., 57 were {{handed over to the}} civilian jurisdiction, and 160 were reduced to the ranks and put on leave without pay." [...] Such <b>remedial</b> <b>actions</b> demonstrated the level of infiltration of the army, and clearly showed that the predominant culpability for the mutiny was seen to be placed squarely on the Vietnamese. In contrast with the first phase of suppression of the VNQDD in 1929, when 121 soldiers suspected of having VNQDĐ membership were punished and 40 put under investigation by the Sûreté, the measures taken after Yen Bay were far more extensive and harsh. More than 500 out of Tonkin's 12,000 indigenous soldiers, a percentage of 4.5%, were punished by the military, demonstrating the extent to which Vietnamese soldiers in the north were seen to be involved in activities contrary to their military duty.|$|E
