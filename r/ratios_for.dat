5|$|Submarine escape {{training}} led US Navy {{personnel to}} believe that Haldane's allowable supersaturation <b>ratios</b> <b>for</b> fast tissues were unnecessarily conservative, as calculated values indicated that supersaturation in trainees exceeded Haldane's limits, {{but they did not}} develop DCS. A large number (2143) of experimental dives were conducted over 3 years to derive allowable supersaturation <b>ratios</b> <b>for</b> a Haldanian 5 compartment model with compartment half-times of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 70 minutes. Values for critical supersaturation derived from this experimental work were different for each tissue compartment. Values for slow tissues (75 and 40-minute) were close to Haldane's findings, but considerably higher values were found for the fast tissues. These values were so high that the researchers concluded that the 5- and 10-minute tissues were not relevant to the development of DCS. Based on these conclusions, a set of tables was computed which omitted the 5- and 10-minute tissues.|$|E
