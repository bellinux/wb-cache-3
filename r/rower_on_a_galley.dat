40|$|Convicts made up an {{important}} {{segment of the}} labor pool in early modern Europe. This essay first focuses <b>on</b> <b>a</b> claim of compensation for the services of convict <b>rowers</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> private <b>galley</b> serving in the Naples fleet {{in the sixteenth century}} and follows contemporary calculations attempting to determine the “cost” of such labor. It then examines the supply side of those relations by analyzing sentences to the galleys from the 1560 s to the 1660 s...|$|R

50|$|Before her death, Anna Petrovna {{had asked}} to be buried {{alongside}} her father in St Petersburg. Two ships, the Raphael and the Cruiser, were dispatched to Kiel for Anna’s body. The coffin was transported up the River Neva <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley,</b> with long black crape hanging overboard, trailing in the water. On 12 November 1728, Anna was laid to rest next to her parents in the still unfinished St Peter and St Paul Cathedral.|$|R

After being forced to serve as <b>a</b> slave <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley,</b> Sir Oliver is liberated by Barbary pirates. He joins the pirates, gaining the name [...] "Sakr-el-Bahr" [...] (the hawk of the sea), and swears vengeance against his brother.|$|R
50|$|Ushakov {{was born}} in the village of Burnakovo in the Yaroslavl gubernia, to a modest family of the minor nobility. On 15 February 1761, he signed up for the Russian Navy in Saint Petersburg. After training, he served <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> in the Baltic Fleet. In 1768 he was {{transferred}} to the Don Flotilla (Azov Sea Navy) in Taganrog, and served in the Russo-Turkish War (1768-74). He commanded Catherine II's own yacht, and later defended Russian merchant ships in the Mediterranean from British naval attacks.|$|R
50|$|Bertrandon de la Broquière left Ghent in February 1432. He {{took the}} route through Champagne and Burgundy to Italy. He {{first went to}} Rome, where he was {{received}} by Pope Eugene IV. On 25 March he set out from Rome for Venice, where he embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> bound for Jaffa on 8 May. The ship was loaded with pilgrims, many of them Burgundians. This part of the voyage is largely ignored in his memoires. He provides only brief descriptions of the Italian cities he passed through {{on his way to}} the sea.|$|R
50|$|He {{was the son}} of Pedro de Toledo Osorio, 5th Marquis of Villafranca, and Elvira de Mendoza. As a {{child he}} was already Trece (thirteen) in the Order of Santiago, Prince of Montalbano and Duke of Fernandina. He joined the navy in 1606 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> under the command of his father and in 1623 became Captain General of the Galleys of Spain. In this capacity, he participated in the {{successful}} Defense of Cadiz in 1625, and won a victory against France when he conquered the Lérins Islands (1635).|$|R
5000|$|At {{a remarkably}} young age, Cadamosto cast {{out as a}} {{merchant}} adventurer, sailing with Venetian galleys in the Mediterranean. From 1442 to 1448, Alvise undertook various trips on Venetian galleys to the Barbary Coast and Crete, as a commercial agent of his cousin, Andrea Barbarigo. [...] In 1451, he was appointed noble officer of the marine corps of crossbowmen <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> to Alexandria. The next year, he served the same position <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Venetian <b>galley</b> to Flanders. Upon his return, he found his family disgraced and dispossessed. His father, caught in a bribery scandal, had been banished from Venice, and taken refuge in the Duchy of Modena. His Querini relatives {{took the opportunity to}} seize possession of his family's property. This setback marred the future prospects of Cadamosto's career in Venice, and probably encouraged his spirit of adventure, hoping to restore his family name and fortune by great feats of his own.|$|R
50|$|Hajji Murad, also Hajji Murat, was an Ottoman Empire {{ambassador}} to France in the 16th century. Hajji Murad and his retinue travelled to France in 1565, <b>on</b> board <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> headed for Malta {{and then on}} two galliots which landed in Marseilles in May 1565.|$|R

25|$|The {{traditional}} two side rudders were complemented with a stern rudder {{sometime after}} c. 1400 {{and eventually the}} side rudders disappeared altogether. It was also during the 15th century that large artillery pieces were first mounted on galleys. Burgundian records from the mid-15th century describe galleys with some form of guns, but do not specify the size. The first conclusive evidence of a large cannon mounted <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> comes from <b>a</b> woodcut of <b>a</b> Venetian <b>galley</b> in 1486. The first guns were fixed directly on timbers in the bow and aimed directly forwards, a placement that would remain largely unchanged until the galley disappeared from active service in the 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Jan Potocki {{was born}} into the Potocki aristocratic family, that owned vast estates across Poland. He was educated in Geneva and Lausanne, served twice in the Polish Army as a captain of engineers, and spent some time <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> as novice to the Knights of Malta. His {{colorful}} life took him across Europe, Asia and North Africa, where he embroiled himself in political intrigues, flirted with secret societies {{and contributed to the}} birth of ethnology - {{he was one of the}} first to study the precursors of the Slavic peoples from a linguistic and historical standpoint.|$|R
40|$|This {{essay will}} {{introduce}} an unpublished urban perspective of Alicante. This drawing {{is part of}} a manuscript kept in the Library Riccardiana of Florence; it is a travel diary written in the first fifteen years of the XVIIth century by <b>a</b> sailor <b>on</b> board the galley of the Tuscan Order of St. Stephen. The perspective was sketched in 1611 and is accompanied by a description of the locations, with particular attention to the fortifications. Alicante is portrayed from the sea and from the northeast: the author is <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley,</b> <b>a</b> short distance from the coast and he uses a low point of view <b>on</b> the horizon. <b>As</b> a result, it provides a reliable picture of an urban and territorial system, comparable to the best-known iconography and it is therefore an interesting testimony of the sites and fortifications before the French bombardment of 1691...|$|R
50|$|The embassy {{arrived in}} Marseille on 3 April 1535 and {{departed}} on 11 April 1535 on the Ottoman galleys {{that had been}} waiting there.

They first stopped at Tunis, where Barbarossa armed <b>a</b> special <b>galley</b> to transport De la Forest to Constantinople.|$|R
50|$|In 1610 Vincenzo was {{involved}} in another fight, this time bloodless, but was again forced to flee to Florence. Here, {{at the age of}} eight, Ferdinando Cospi became a page of Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. In 1616 he joined the Order of the Knights of St. Stephen, but so he would not have to serve <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> he was made a page of the grand master, who was also the Grand Duke, and who brought him up with his children. When Cosimo II died in 1621, Ferdinando II promoted Cospi to a page of the black livery, and took him to live in the Palazzo Vecchio.|$|R
50|$|Valjean serves {{his time}} <b>on</b> <b>an</b> actual <b>galley.</b> <b>On</b> leaving the bishop's house, Valjean kneels <b>on</b> <b>a</b> fallen rose.

5000|$|Ploughed like <b>a</b> slave <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> (Пахал, как раб на галерах) - (The Russian verb пахать {{also has}} the general meaning of [...] "to do hard work".) This is how Putin {{described}} his work as President of Russia from 2000 to 2008 during a Q&A conference in February 2008. Not only did the phrase itself became popular, but a wrong hearing of it—как раб ("like a slave") in Russian sounds almost identical to как краб ("like a crab")—led to {{the appearance of a}} popular Internet nickname for Putin, [...] "Crabbe" [...] (Russian: Крабе), while Dmitry Medvedev was (for some reason) similarly nicknamed Shmele (Russian: Шмеле, a non-existent vocative form of шмель, meaning [...] "bumblebee").|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the later}} galleys were monstrous in size, with oars as long as 17 metres each pulled {{by as many as}} eight banks of rowers. With so many rowers, if one of them was killed by a {{catapult}} shot, the rest could continue and not interrupt the stroke. The innermost oarsman <b>on</b> such <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> had to step forward and back a few paces with each stroke.|$|R
50|$|Archbishop John VIII (Giovanni Bruni) {{participated in}} the Council of Trent between 1551 and 1552, and between 1562 and 1563, at which {{sessions}} he spoke with distinction. He was the fiercest opponent of the surrender {{of the city of}} Bar to the Turks. However, the Venetian governor of Bar, Count Alessandro Donato, and the Venetian military commander Giovanni Guidaccioni, decided that surrender was unavoidable. One source claims that they had sent the Archbishop and 600 soldiers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> to Ali Pasha (Ali Müezzinzade Pasha), the admiral of the besieging Ottoman fleet, who offered to purchase the Archbishop for 25,000 Venetian sequins; but any such offer was never finalised. Like many other people from Bar and Ulcinj whom the Ottoman forces had captured when those cities fell to their attacks and were surrendered to them in August 1571, the Archbishop was one of the slaves who rowed in <b>an</b> Ottoman <b>galley</b> at the Battle of Lepanto on 7th October.|$|R
50|$|As {{a member}} of D'Ornessan's staff, he {{traveled}} to Istanbul <b>on</b> <b>a</b> French <b>galley,</b> and wrote <b>a</b> famous account of his travels, Le Voyage du Baron de Saint Blancard en Turquie. He was a witness of the Siege of Corfu (1537), and also witnessed the depredations of the Ottoman fleet in Christian territory.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Cilius {{has failed}} {{in an attempt}} to {{purchase}} Sophia's freedom; to save her from the Neapolitan slave market, he sets the Roman prisoners free and escapes, with them and his followers, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> of his own. After a storm, the two parties blunder into each other <b>on</b> <b>a</b> deserted Calabrian coast. They fight; Cilius captures Facertes, Cicilia, and Paulina, but Virgilius, though wounded (again), escapes. Cilius soon tracks him down; they fight; more wounds. In the final revelation scene, Cilius turns out to be Lucius, the long-lost brother of Facertes and Cicilia. In the rather rushed and perfunctory conclusion, Virgilius wins Cicilia, and Facertes will marry Sophia; Cilius/Lucius loves her too, but this is forgotten about, as is Paulina's affection for Virgilius. Multiple plot holes (how did Caesar's daughter get captured by slavers; how did Sicilian princess Cicilia get captured by slavers; etc.) are left unfilled.|$|R
50|$|Under the 1640 {{codification}} of gabelle law by Jean-Baptiste Colbert, {{participating in}} faux saunage, warranted {{a range of}} harsh punishments. Merely housing a faux-saunier could lead to imprisonment, fines, and, if repeated, death. Faux-sauniers could be sentenced to up to ten years <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> if they were caught without weapons, and to death if caught while armed. Other forms of faux-saunage included sheepherders letting their flock drink from salty ponds, traders overly salting cod during transportation, and fishing at night (so that fisherman with great knowledge of waterways couldn’t smuggle salt). French nobles, if caught purchasing contraband salt, would immediately lose their status of nobility following their first offense. In 1773, along the Loire River, which separated the regions of Brittany and Anjou, with respective salt prices of 31 sous and 591 sous, over 3000 soldiers were stationed {{in response to the}} massive amounts of smuggling that took place.|$|R
6000|$|Man after man {{was taken}} away, {{one at a}} time, and the wrecks of men were brought back, one by one, to rave and howl in the darkness. And as I lay there {{and listened to the}} moaning and the groaning, and all the idle {{chattering}} of pain-addled wits, somehow, vaguely reminiscent, {{it seemed to me that}} somewhere, some time, I had sat in a high place, callous and proud, and listened to a similar chorus of moaning and groaning. Afterwards, as you shall learn, I identified this reminiscence and knew that the moaning and the groaning was of the sweep-slaves manacled to their benches, which I heard from above, <b>on</b> the poop, <b>a</b> soldier passenger <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> of old Rome.

5000|$|Christian Europeans {{soon began}} {{attempting}} {{to find the}} sea route {{to the mouth of}} the Senegal. The first known effort may have been by the Genoese brothers Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi, who set out down the coast in 1291 in a pair of ships (nothing more is heard of them). In 1346, the Majorcan sailor, Jaume Ferrer set out <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>galley</b> with the explicit objective of finding the [...] "River of Gold" [...] (Riu de l'Or), where he heard that most people along its shores were engaged in the collection of gold and that the river was wide and deep enough for the largest ships. Nothing more is heard of him either. In 1402, after establishing the first European colony on the Canary Islands, the French Norman adventurers Jean de Béthencourt and Gadifer de la Salle set about immediately probing the African coast, looking for directions to the mouth of Senegal.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>rower</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> {{fixed seat}} {{is limited in}} the amount of power he can apply to the oars by the {{strength}} in his upper body and the distance he can pull the oars on each stroke. After riggers were added to the shell allowing the use of longer oars, rowers took advantage by taking longer strokes and using their legs during the stroke. At first, the athletes wore trousers with wear resistant leather bottoms covered in grease and the shells had concave, longitudinal seats. The athletes could then use their legs to slide along the seat, adding the power of their legs and letting them greatly lengthen the stroke. This eventually led to the modern sliding seat, mounted on rollers, which allows nearly frictionless movement of the rower's body.The first sliding seat was developed by George Warren of Toronto, a boat builder and famous decoy maker, who at the time was coach to world rowing champion Ned Hanlen. With the advent of the sliding seat Ned was able to greatly outperform his English and American counterparts.|$|R
