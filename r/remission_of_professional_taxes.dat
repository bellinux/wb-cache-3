Moreover, the tax advisors exhibit a significantly higher level of overconfidence compared to laymen and the degree of overconfidence increases with professional experience.

Respondents are presented with realistic tax return scenarios, in which the demands of the client are varied according to the risk of audit, the severity of tax law and the materiality of dollar amounts involved. The findings suggest that the severity of tax law violation is an important factor in ethical decision-making, but that audit risk and the amounts involved are not. The lack of support for audit risk as an influential variable is an important outcome, because policy makers have traditionally proceeded on the basis that increases in audit probabilities will reduce the likelihood of taxpayers adopting aggressive tax reporting positions. However, since the findings are based on an Australian sample, care must be taken in generalizing these findings elsewhere. The implications are important in that alternative enforcement and compliance strategies must be considered by tax administrators.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of tax {{simplification}} on various indicators of {{the efficiency of the}} tax system and on the distribution of income. The analysis is based on a simulation model (FiFoSiM) using German income tax and household survey microdata. We model tax simplification as the abolition of a set of deductions from the tax base included in the German income tax system. We find that this form of tax base simplification leads to a reduction in the use <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>tax</b> advice, a more equitable income distribution and an increase in tax revenue. If these measures are combined with a reduction of income tax rates to preserve revenue neutrality, the effects depend on the type of rate schedule adjustment. The combination with a flat rate tax implies redistribution in favour of very high incomes, and an overall increase in income inequality. Efficiency effects in terms of changes in marginal tax rates and labor supply effects are mixed. The combination with a rate schedule adjustment which preserves the directly progressive rate schedule yields a tax reform which reduces the inequality of after tax incomes. We conclude that tax simplification may improve the efficiency of the tax system without increasing inequality of after tax income.

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} use of tax rate variables in both micro and macro-economic research, measurement of income tax rates has largely been ignored. When tax returns are unavailable, income variables are used to compute tax rates. Measurement error in income and unobserved deductions, exemptions and credits make these inherently noisy measures of true rates. This dissertation reports new survey measures of average (ATR) and marginal (MTR) income tax rates from the Cognitive Economics Study (CogEcon). Survey measures are interpreted as tax rate perceptions, which are used to correct for survey noise when imputing true rates and then to characterize heterogeneity in misperceptions. Chapter 1 advances a new survey methodology for measuring income tax rates. Data come from a panel of respondents' reported marginal tax rates, average tax rates and income in two subsequent waves of CogEcon. The individual measures of tax beliefs display heterogeneity, even after accounting for income and potential survey noise. Respondents systematically overestimate average tax rates and exhibit substantial heterogeneity. Perceptions of marginal tax rates are accurate at the mean, but exhibit mean reversion and substantial heterogeneity. Perceptions of marginal and average tax rates (conditional on the true rates) vary depending on cognitive ability, general financial knowledge and use <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>tax</b> assistance. Chapter 2 uses a finite mixture model to uncover heterogeneous income tax rate perceptions. This paper establishes four new results. First, almost half of respondents do not distinguish between marginal and average tax rates. Second, roughly 30 percent of respondents know the statutory marginal tax rates schedule (and answer questions accordingly). Third, among respondents who think all income is taxed at the same rate, roughly 40 percent think all of their income is taxed at the statutory marginal tax rate. Finally, respondents with higher cognitive ability {{are more likely to}} report statutory marginal tax rates, but only among respondents who prepare their own income tax returns...|$|R
