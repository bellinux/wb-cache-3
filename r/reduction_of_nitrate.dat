Sand filters, lagooning and reed beds can all be used to reduce nitrogen, but the activated sludge process (if designed well) {{can do the job}} the most easily. Since denitrification is the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrate</b> to dinitrogen (molecular nitrogen) gas, an electron donor is needed. This can be, depending on the waste water, organic matter (from feces), sulfide, or an added donor like methanol. [...] The sludge in the anoxic tanks (denitrification tanks) must be mixed well (mixture of recirculated mixed liquor, return activated sludge , and raw influent) e.g. by using submersible mixers in order to achieve the desired denitrification.|$|E

The catalytic <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrates</b> was efficiently performed with H- 2 or H- 2 + HCOOH as the reductant, but was poorly efficient in the presence of HCOOH alone. In the photocatalytic experiments, UV irradiation significantly improved the reaction provided that both H- 2 + HCOOH were present. Ammonium formation occurred at high conversion <b>of</b> <b>nitrates,</b> whatever the reaction conditions applied.

2500|$|Denitrification is the {{utilization}} of nitrate (...) as a terminal electron acceptor. [...] It is a widespread process {{that is used by}} many members of the Proteobacteria. [...] Many facultative anaerobes use denitrification because nitrate, like oxygen, has a high reduction potential. [...] Many denitrifying bacteria can also use ferric iron (...) and some organic electron acceptors. [...] Denitrification involves the stepwise <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrate</b> to nitrite (...) , nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (...) , and dinitrogen (...) by the enzymes nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, nitric oxide reductase, and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively. [...] Protons are transported across the membrane by the initial NADH reductase, quinones, and nitrous oxide reductase to produce the electrochemical gradient critical for respiration. [...] Some organisms (e.g. E. coli) only produce nitrate reductase and therefore can accomplish only the first reduction leading to the accumulation of nitrite. [...] Others (e.g. Paracoccus denitrificans or Pseudomonas stutzeri) reduce nitrate completely. [...] Complete denitrification is an environmentally significant process because some intermediates of denitrification (nitric oxide and nitrous oxide) are important greenhouse gases that react with sunlight and ozone to produce nitric acid, a component of acid rain. [...] Denitrification is also important in biological wastewater treatment where it is used {{to reduce the amount of}} nitrogen released into the environment thereby reducing eutrophication.|$|E

Catalytic <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrates</b> emerged as a promising technique to remove nitrate in water.

The highest nitrogen yield is achieved with a Cu/Zn ratio 1. Also, the incidence of the Pt metal loading was studied {{in the range of}} 0. 5 - 2 %.

40|$|The {{reduction}} by CO under dry {{condition of}} NOx species stored at 350 C onto a PtABa/Al 2 O 3 Lean NOx Trap catalyst is investigated {{by means of}} transient response methods (CO-TPSR and CO-ISC experiments) and complementary FTIR spectroscopy.

The CO-TPSR and CO-ISC experiments and the combined FTIR study show that (i) the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrates</b> by CO occurs via a consecutive reaction scheme with formation of nitrites and then of surface isocyanate/cyanate species followed by the reaction of these species with residual nitrites to give nitrogen; (ii) the reaction of NCO species with nitrites to give nitrogen is slower than the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>nitrates</b> to give nitrites and then NCO species; (iii) upon contact with oxygen at increasing temperature, NCO species can be re-oxidized to surface nitrites {{at first and then}} to surface nitrates; (iv) the formation of nitrogen is observed during the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> stored NOx by CO, and during the oxidation of surface NCO species upon oxygen addition and upon admission of NO in the presence of excess O 2.
