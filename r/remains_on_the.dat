If the migrating group <b>remains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same face of the π system, the shift is known as suprafacial, while if the migrating group transfers to the opposite face is called an antarafacial shift, which are impossible for transformations that occur within small- or medium-sized rings.|$|E
5|$|Although the Act of Parliament {{defining}} {{high treason}} <b>remains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom's statute books, {{during a long}} period of 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England in 1870. The death penalty for treason was abolished in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Mount Osmond {{contains}} {{a number of}} historical attractions; notably in the former mines and mining infrastructure that <b>remains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hillside {{as a reminder of}} its past. The mines continue up throughout the hills from Glen Osmond. While Wheal Gawler and Wheal Watkins are former open-cut mines (located in Glen Osmond), Mount Osmond contains more mineshafts which are up to sixty metres deep.|$|E

5|$|The Panama–Pacific International Exposition, {{constructed}} in San Francisco by the Golden Gate {{at a cost}} of $50 million, was open from February 20, 1915, to December 4, 1915. About 19,000,000 people attended, and the exposition was a great success, generating enough profit to build the San Francisco Civic Auditorium with about $1 million remaining. The Palace of Fine Arts is the only building from the fair which <b>remains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> site.|$|E

5|$|A {{division}} of the DOT, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), regulates safety for the U.S. trucking industry. The FMCSA enforces the length, width, and weight limits of CMVs set by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for interstate commercial traffic. Interstate commercial traffic is generally limited to a network of Interstate Highways, U.S. Highways, and state highways known as the National Network (NN). Provided the truck <b>remains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> NN, it {{is not subject to}} state limits. These limits (which can be lower or higher than federal limits) come into effect for intrastate commercial traffic, provided the vehicle is not on the NN.|$|E

5|$|An Italian Canadian butcher named Lupo is {{complaining}} {{about his job}} one day, while cutting meat in his shop. As each new slice falls to the ground, Lupo grows increasingly angry and swears at the meat. He then accidentally cuts off his own thumb, which inexplicably causes his entire body to fall apart. Blood gushes out onto the ground, and the various pieces of Lupo's body collapse into a pile. The screen darkens and closes in on Lupo's severed head, but before the scene can disappear entirely, Lupo's head jumps forward, still alive. It <b>remains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen, shouting insults during the credits, and then falls asleep.|$|E
5|$|Brummer and Bremse {{typically}} operated together {{throughout the}} war. They participated in numerous minelaying operations in 1916 and 1917. The two cruisers devastated a British convoy to Norway in October 1917, sinking the two escorting destroyers {{and most of}} the transports. Both were interned at Scapa Flow {{at the end of the}} war; they were successfully scuttled in June 1919. Brummer <b>remains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the harbor, but Bremse was raised for scrapping in 1929 and broken up in the early 1930s.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{a recall}} vote was held asking if 2003 inductee Chris Benoit, who {{killed his wife}} and son before {{committing}} suicide in June 2007, should remain in the hall. To have Benoit removed, Meltzer required that 60% of voters must agree with the proposal. Although the majority voted for Benoit's removal, they only represented 53.6% of the votes, falling short of the number required. Benoit <b>remains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> list of inductees.|$|E
5|$|In Harrison, NY120 passes several mansions on {{both sides}} of the highway as it {{gradually}} turns northwestward and approaches I-287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). The route parallels the western edge of the freeway for several blocks to Westchester Avenue, where NY120 meets the southern end of NY120A, an alternate route through the easternmost part of Westchester County. While NY120A heads east toward Port Chester, NY120 takes on the Westchester Avenue name as the two directions of the route split to follow collector/distributor roads running northwestward along both sides of I-287. The route <b>remains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> frontage roads for about a half-mile (0.8km) to another section of Purchase Street, where NY120 turns to follow a slightly more northward track through another residential section of Harrison.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Cochrane argues that each school has an {{important}} contribution to make to animal justice, particularly liberalism and utilitarianism. He then outlines his own approach. He writes that, while talk of our political and moral obligations to animals is today more prominent than ever, it <b>remains</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> periphery of mainstream dialogue in political theory. He closes by arguing that this neglect is a problem for political theory, and that animals are owed justice. If the book's claims are correct, Cochrane concludes, questions concerning the treatment of animals should be considered some of the most pressing political issues today.|$|E

5|$|Retained {{under the}} Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, both ships were modernized significantly, with torpedo bulges and oil-fired boilers {{installed}} and other improvements made, but were demilitarized under {{terms of the}} 1930 London Naval Treaty. Florida was scrapped, Utah converted into first a radio-controlled target ship, then an anti-aircraft gunnery trainer. She served in the latter role until sunk by the Japanese during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941.

5|$|Runyon {{was built}} {{immediately}} after the entry of Union forces into Virginia on May 24, 1861, on the land of James Roach, a Washington building contractor.

Union soldiers garrisoned the fort until its dismantling {{following the end of}} the Civil War in 1865.
