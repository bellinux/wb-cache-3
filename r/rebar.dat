5|$|Makeup artist Baker {{provided}} the special makeup effects for The Incredible Melting Man, {{which included the}} gradual melting of Steve West. <b>Rebar</b> wore facial appliances that simulated melting flesh, and {{his hands and feet}} were fitted with liquid substances that dropped off as he walked, creating the appearance that West's body was falling apart. During one scene, a murdered fisherman's severed head falls down a waterfall and smashes on the rocks below. To create the effect, Baker used a gelatin head with a wax skull and fake blood inside, which burst out upon impact.|$|E
5|$|Alex <b>Rebar,</b> {{in one of}} only {{a handful}} of film {{appearances}} throughout his acting career, starred as Steve West. Burr DeBenning played Dr. Ted Nelson, and General Michael Perry was portrayed by Myron Healey, who was, Everman notes, often cast as a villain in 1950s science fiction films. Film director Jonathan Demme played the small role of Matt Winters, one of West's victims. Rainbeaux Smith, best known for her appearances in B movies and exploitation films, appeared in The Incredible Melting Man as a model who finds one of West's victims while trying to avoid a photographer seeking to take explicit photos of her.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a model {{based on the}} thermal network concept and Fourier’s law, a model to predict the effective thermal conductivity(keff) of reinforced concrete containing round <b>rebars.</b> To validate the mathematical models for the effective thermal of reinforced concrete containing round <b>rebars</b> oriented normal (θ⊥) or parallel (θ∥) to the heat-flow direction was investigated numerically using ANSYS CFX 16.2. Mathematical models were compared with FVM results at various volume fraction of steel, number of <b>rebars</b> and orientations of <b>rebars.</b> At {{the same number of}} <b>rebars,</b> the effective thermal conductivity of reinforced concrete is affected by volume fraction of steel. Furthermore, at the same volume fraction of steel, the effective thermal conductivity decreases as the number of <b>rebars</b> increases if the <b>rebars</b> are in the θ⊥ orientation, but increases as the number of <b>rebars</b> increases if they are in the θ∥ orientation. The mathematical model generally matches the results of FVM well. The average standard deviation between models and FVM results is 0.52 %. The small magnitude of this disagreement indicates that these mathematical models can be used to estimate keff of reinforced concrete containing multiple round <b>rebars</b> at volume fraction of steel less than 15 %.|$|R
40|$|In a {{large number}} of steel {{reinforced}} concrete buildings in Greece, spalling of the cement has left the steel reinforcement (<b>rebars)</b> exposed to the atmosphere. This has led to corrosion of the exposed <b>rebars,</b> especially in coastal areas, with questions regarding their remaining load-carrying capacity. This work addresses the problem of corrosion and strength degradation of such exposed <b>rebars.</b> A large number of samples (sections of exposed <b>rebars)</b> were collected from buildings up to 96 years old, and weight loss measurements, tensile testing and fractographic analysis were carried out. Accelerated corrosion testing (salt spray) was performed on new similar grade <b>rebars</b> in order to establish a correlation with the naturally corroded exposed <b>rebars.</b> It was found that exposed <b>rebars</b> suffer from uniform corrosion followed by degradation of mechanical properties. In certain cases the properties were below the minimum threshold required by the international standards. A rough estimate of the correlation factor between natural corrosion of exposed <b>rebars</b> and salt spray corrosion has been derived. This correlation factor could be used, under certain limitations, to estimate the condition, in terms of mechanical property degradation and structural integrity, of coastal buildings with exposed <b>rebars</b> in Greece.

Compost blankets were applied to large sections of the soil to replace lost nutrients. In 2009 the foundation began removing metal and <b>rebar</b> snow fences embedded in the soil just below the pass summit during the 1960s as part of an abortive project to increase meltwater capture by the Twin Lakes Tunnel. They were an aesthetic blight as well as an environmental problem, and had to be removed using a team of mules and helicopters due to the wilderness area restrictions. The last fence material was removed in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Baker created four {{distinct}} {{stages of}} makeup design so that West {{would appear to}} melt gradually as time passed. However, after the film went through two separate stages of editing, these makeup stages were ultimately eliminated from the final cut, and the character looks generally the same throughout the film. Richard Meyers, author of The World of Fantasy Films, said actor <b>Rebar</b> was impatient and uncooperative with the extensive makeup sessions required for the effects, and thus did not wear all of the facial appliances Baker designed. This, Meyers said, {{might have been an}} additional factor in the lack of makeup effect stages in the final film. The version of the film shot by Sachs had not included any scenes with West before he sustained the radiation poisoning that caused his body to melt. Such scenes were, however, re-shot later by the producers without Sachs' participation.|$|E

30|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to estimate the effective thermal conductivity model for the reinforced concrete containing round <b>rebars.</b> The thermal network concept and Fourier’s law are used to develop a mathematical model to calculate the effective thermal conductivity (keff) of reinforced concrete with different numbers of round <b>rebars</b> oriented either normal or parallel to the heat-transfer direction, and different volume fractions of steel. Model predictions generally agree well with results of numerical simulations using the finite-volume method (FVM). FVM results suggest that at fixed volume fractions of steel, the effective thermal conductivity decreases as the number of round <b>rebars</b> increases if the <b>rebars</b> are in the normal orientation but increases as the number of round <b>rebars</b> increases if they are in the parallel orientation. This research can be used in practical conditions to predict the effective thermal conductivity of reinforced concrete containing round <b>rebars</b> accurately.|$|R
25|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} columns typically contain large diameter vertical <b>rebar</b> (reinforcing bars) {{arranged in}} a ring, surrounded by lighter-gauge hoops of <b>rebar.</b> Upon analysis of failures due to earthquakes, it has been realized that the weakness {{was not in the}} vertical bars, but rather in inadequate strength and quantity of hoops. Once the integrity of the hoops is breached, the vertical <b>rebar</b> can flex outward, stressing the central column of concrete. The concrete then simply crumbles into small pieces, now unconstrained by the surrounding <b>rebar.</b> In new construction a greater amount of hoop-like structures are used.|$|E
25|$|There {{is growing}} {{interest}} in applying external reinforcement to existing structures using advanced materials such as composite (fiberglass, basalt, carbon) <b>rebar,</b> which can impart exceptional strength. Worldwide {{there are a number}} of brands of composite <b>rebar</b> recognized by different countries, such as Aslan, DACOT, V-rod, and ComBar. The number of projects using composite <b>rebar</b> increases day by day around the world, in countries ranging from USA, Russia, and South Korea to Germany.|$|E
25|$|In wet {{and cold}} climates, {{reinforced}} concrete for roads, bridges, parking structures and other structures {{that may be}} exposed to deicing salt may benefit from use of corrosion-resistant reinforcement such as uncoated, low carbon/chromium (micro composite), epoxy-coated, hot dip galvanised or stainless steel <b>rebar.</b> Good design and a well-chosen concrete mix will provide additional protection for many applications. Uncoated, low carbon/chromium <b>rebar</b> looks similar to standard carbon steel <b>rebar</b> due to its lack of a coating; its highly corrosion-resistant features are inherent in the steel microstructure. It can be identified by the unique ASTM specified mill marking on its smooth, dark charcoal finish. Epoxy coated <b>rebar</b> can easily be identified by the light green colour of its epoxy coating. Hot dip galvanized <b>rebar</b> may be bright or dull grey depending on length of exposure, and stainless <b>rebar</b> exhibits a typical white metallic sheen that is readily distinguishable from carbon steel reinforcing bar.

40|$|The {{reinforced}} concrete structures have to survive high temperature and carbonation at low latitude region. The {{research on the}} effect of temperature and the effect of carbonation are vital to the corrosion of the <b>rebars</b> in concrete structures. The coupled effect of temperature and carbonation on the corrosion of <b>rebars</b> was researched by using the open circuit potential (OCP), the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and the potentiodynamic polarization (PP) measurement in the simulated concrete pore solutions (SPSs). The high temperature environment is conducive to the formation of passivated surface of <b>rebars</b> in SPSs, but the dissolution velocity of passivated surface is higher. The <b>rebars</b> have the greater capacity of passivity at lower temperature. The corrosion rate of <b>rebars</b> at higher temperature is smaller in moderate pH value (10. 6) SPSs. The <b>rebars</b> suffer from serious corrosion in the pH = 9. 6 SPSs at 318 [*]K temperature...|$|R

25|$|Ultimate failure {{leading to}} {{collapse}} {{can be caused}} by crushing the concrete, which occurs when compressive stresses exceed its strength, by yielding or failure of the <b>rebar</b> when bending or shear stresses exceed the strength of the reinforcement, or by bond failure between the concrete and the <b>rebar.</b>|$|E
25|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} {{can fail}} due to inadequate strength, leading to mechanical failure, or {{due to a}} reduction in its durability. Corrosion and freeze/thaw cycles may damage poorly designed or constructed reinforced concrete. When <b>rebar</b> corrodes, the oxidation products (rust) expand and tends to flake, cracking the concrete and unbonding the <b>rebar</b> from the concrete. Typical mechanisms leading to durability problems are discussed below.|$|E
25|$|One form of {{retrofit}} is {{to drill}} numerous holes into {{the surface of}} the wall, and secure short L-shaped sections of <b>rebar</b> to the surface of each hole with epoxy adhesive. Additional vertical and horizontal <b>rebar</b> is then secured to the new elements, a form is erected, and an additional layer of concrete is poured. This modification may be combined with additional footings in excavated trenches and additional support ledgers and tie-backs to retain the span on the bounding walls.|$|E

The keff model of reinforced concrete containing multiple round <b>rebars</b> can be acquired by solving complex thermal network (Fig.  4). The thermal network including many round <b>rebars</b> can be generally expressed in two parts: concrete layer that is modelled by using the thermal resistance of concrete; and a mixed layer composed of alternating thermal resistances of concrete and steel. The two layers are stacked alternately beginning and ending with concrete layers (Fig.  4). The theoretical model of keff is derived as follows.|$|R
40|$|During the {{electrochemical}} realkalisation treatment of reinforced concrete, hydroxyl ions are produced around the <b>rebars</b> {{leading to an}} increase of the pH {{which is expected to}} stop or slow down the corrosion activity of the <b>rebars.</b> In this paper, two sets of carbonated reinforced concrete slabs were realkalised : for the first set, the <b>rebars</b> were corroded due to an accelerated carbonation process and for the second set, the <b>rebars</b> were additionally intentiostatically corroded after the same carbonation process. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the realkalisation used as a maintenance or rehabilitation treatment, electrochemical characterizations (rest potential, linear polarization resistance, impedance) were performed as non destructive tests. Analytical characterizations such as qualitative and quantitative pH determinations were also conducted. According to {{the electrochemical}} results, the efficiency of the treatment depends on the initial corrosion state of the <b>rebars.</b> These results will be discussed together with the evolution of the basicity of the concrete around the <b>rebars</b> to finally assess the efficiency of the realkalisation treatment...|$|R
50|$|A {{possible}} economical {{solution for}} this paradox is the placing {{of a second}} layer of corrosion-resistant reinforcement like stainless steel <b>rebars</b> or meshes or FRP <b>rebars</b> in the concrete cover to distribute the cracks.|$|R
25|$|When a {{concrete}} structure is designed, it is usual {{to specify the}} concrete cover for the <b>rebar</b> (the depth of the <b>rebar</b> within the object). The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or building codes. If the reinforcement {{is too close to}} the surface, early failure due to corrosion may occur. The concrete cover depth can be measured with a cover meter. However, carbonated concrete incurs a durability problem only when there is also sufficient moisture and oxygen to cause electropotential corrosion of the reinforcing steel.|$|E
25|$|Cracking of the {{concrete}} section {{is nearly impossible to}} prevent; however, the size and location of cracks can be limited and controlled by appropriate reinforcement, control joints, curing methodology and concrete mix design. Cracking can allow moisture to penetrate and corrode the reinforcement. This is a serviceability failure in limit state design. Cracking is normally the result of an inadequate quantity of <b>rebar,</b> or <b>rebar</b> spaced at too great a distance. The concrete then cracks either under excess loading, or due to internal effects such as early thermal shrinkage while it cures.|$|E

40|$|Modelling of {{existing}} reinforced concrete (r. c.) frames designed without specific seismic rules {{is a key}} problem for maintenance, structural upgrading and seismic assessment. In many European countries a very large percentage of reinforced concrete buildings are 40 years old, or even older; thus reinforcement consists of smooth <b>rebars,</b> since only in the 1970 ’s did early applications of deformed <b>rebars</b> appear. Technical literature on mechanical performances of anchored smooth <b>rebars</b> is non-comprehensive, mainly from the deformation standpoint, despite the relevance of this aspect to the response of critical regions, i. e. beam to column joints and column bases. In the present paper a series of experimental tests on smooth <b>rebars</b> are presented; they are aimed at describing in detail the force–slip relation for the bond mechanism for straight <b>rebars</b> and for anchoring end details, i. e. circular hooks with a 180 ∘ opening angle...|$|R

25|$|There is {{considerable}} overlap between {{the subjects of}} non-steel reinforcement and fiber-reinforcement of concrete. The introduction of non-steel reinforcement of concrete is relatively recent; it takes two major forms: non-metallic <b>rebar</b> rods, and non-steel (usually also non-metallic) fibres incorporated into the cement matrix. For example, there is increasing interest in glass fiber reinforced concrete (GFRC) and in various applications of polymer fibres incorporated into concrete. Although currently {{there is not much}} suggestion that such materials will in general replace metal <b>rebar,</b> some of them have major advantages in specific applications, and there also are new applications in which metal <b>rebar</b> simply is not an option. However, the design and application of non-steel reinforcing is fraught with challenges. For one thing, concrete is a highly alkaline environment, in which many materials, including most kinds of glass, have a poor service life. Also, the behaviour of such reinforcing materials differs from the behaviour of metals, for instance in terms of shear strength, creep and elasticity.|$|E

40|$|Although {{steel is}} most {{commonly}} used as a reinforcing material in concrete due to its competitive cost and favorable mechanical properties, the problem of corrosion of steel <b>rebars</b> leads {{to a reduction in}} life span of the structure and adds to maintenance costs. Many techniques have been developed in recent past to reduce corrosion (galvanizing, epoxy coating, etc.) but none of the solutions seem to be viable as an adequate solution to the corrosion problem. Apart from the use of fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) <b>rebars,</b> hybrid <b>rebars</b> consisting of both FRP and steel are also being tried to overcome the problem of steel corrosion. This paper evaluates the performance of hybrid <b>rebars</b> as longitudinal reinforcement in normal strength concrete beams. Hybrid <b>rebars</b> used in this study essentially consist of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) strands of 2 mm diameter wound helically on a mild steel core of 6 mm diameter. GFRP stirrups have been used as shear reinforcement. An attempt has been made to evaluate the flexural and shear performance of beams having hybrid <b>rebars</b> in normal strength concrete with and without polypropylene fibers added to the concrete matrix...|$|R
40|$|Composite {{reinforcing}} bars (<b>rebars)</b> {{that are used}} in concrete members with high performance (strength and durability) properties could have beneficial effects on the behavior of these members. This is especially vital when a building is constructed in an aggressive environment, for instance a corrosive environment. Although tension capacity/weight (or volume) ratios in composite <b>rebars</b> (carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP), etc.) are very high when compared to steel <b>rebars,</b> major weaknesses in concrete members reinforced with these composite <b>rebars</b> may be the potential consequences of relatively poor bonding capacity. This may even be more crucial when the member is subjected to cyclic loading. Although monotonic bond tests are available in the literature, only limited experimental studies exist on bond characteristics under cyclic loading conditions. In order to fill this gap and propose preliminary design recommendations, 10 specimens of 10 -mm-diameter ribbed CFRP <b>rebars</b> embedded in specially designed high strength concrete (f’c = 70 MPa) blocks were subjected to monotonic and cyclic pullout tests. The experimental results showed that cyclically loaded CFRP <b>rebars</b> had less bond strength than those companion specimens loaded monotonically...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to investigate the influence of FRP confinement on the buckling behavior of longitudinal steel reinforcing bars (<b>rebars)</b> in RC columns subjected to monotonic and cyclic axial compression. Test results of 12 FRP-confined RC columns and 12 FRP-confined plain concrete columns (control specimens) are presented with particular attention to the evolution of strains in the longitudinal steel <b>rebars</b> and the FRP jacket as the load increases. For an FRP-confined RC column subjected to monotonic axial compression, the contribution of longitudinal steel <b>rebars</b> to the overall axial load carried by the column was deduced by subtracting the contribution of the FRP-confined plain concrete from the total axial load. The test results showed that the compressive stress-strain response of longitudinal steel <b>rebars</b> in FRP-confined RC columns follows that from tensile testing before the axial stress reduces gradually due to the onset of buckling deformation. Significant interactions were found to exist between FRP confinement and the buckling of longitudinal steel <b>rebars.</b> This interaction should be carefully considered when formulating constitutive laws for both the longitudinal steel <b>rebars</b> and the FRP-confined concrete for use in theoretical modeling.
