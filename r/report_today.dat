5000|$|Harold and Maude {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with several}} critics being {{offended by the}} film's dark humor. Roger Ebert, in a review dated January 1, 1972, gave the film 1 and a half out of 4 stars. He wrote, [...] "And so what we get, finally, is a movie of attitudes. Harold is death, Maude life, and they manage to make the two seem so similar that life's hardly worth the extra bother. The visual style makes everyone look fresh from the Wax Museum, and all the movie lacks {{is a lot of}} day-old gardenias and lilies and roses in the lobby, filling the place with a cloying sweet smell. Nothing more to <b>report</b> <b>today.</b> Harold doesn't even make pallbearer." [...] Vincent Canby also panned the film, stating that the actors [...] "are so aggressive, so creepy and off-putting, that Harold and Maude are obviously made for each other, a point the movie itself refuses to recognize with a twist ending that betrays, I think, its life-affirming pretensions." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{company also}} did work in {{underdeveloped}} countries. In the late 1940s, many poor countries desired {{to raise their}} standard of living by increasing output of food, natural resources and manufactured goods. Iran, for example, made a noteworthy start toward this end by engaging Overseas Consultants Inc. to advise on a proposed US$650,000,000 development program. (TIME Magazine, Oct. 24, 1949). The company conducted a detailed study that ultimately resulted in a multi-volume <b>report.</b> <b>Today,</b> the report provides invaluable historical insight into the economic development of Iran as of the late 1940s. Unfortunately, implementation of the plan fizzled out because the impoverished Iranian government lacked sufficient funds. Foreign aid donors - during, in part, the brief rule of Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadeq - did not provide money for implementation. (TIME Magazine, Jun. 4, 1951). The foreign aid donors were not forthcoming because Mossadeq and the Iranian government wished to see those funds or loans benefit Iran's oil industry directly, not benefit the Iranian-Anglo Oil company exclusively, which was owned principally by the British government.|$|E

The December 13, 2003 killing of the Anuak people was alleged to have been sparked by the death of 8 Ethiopia highlanders who were killed by unknown groups.

[...] The athlete committee, the Institute of National Anti-Doping Organizations, and the leaders of anti-doping agencies in Austria, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States called for Russia to be banned from the 2016 Olympics in Rio. After Bach delayed a decision on whether to ban the entire Russian team, IOC member Dick Pound said, [...] "the IOC is for some reason very reluctant to think about a total exclusion of the Russian team. But we've got institutionalized, government-organised cheating on a wide scale across a whole range of sports in a country. You've got to keep from turning tolerance into: ‘We have zero tolerance except for Russia.'" [...] Bruce Arthur of the Toronto Star said, [...] "If the threshold Russia established is not high enough to merit a total ban from an Olympic Games, it's a remarkable precedent to set." [...] Former IOC vice president, Kevan Gosper of Australia, said, [...] "we {{have to be very careful}} making the wrong move with an important country like Russia", to which Richard Hind of The Daily Telegraph (Australia) responded, [...] "And there is the IOC in a nut shell.

50|$|Noticed at WTVT-TV by Florida native Deborah Amos of National Public Radio, Shuster {{was invited}} to move to Washington and join NPR where {{he became one of}} the early {{producers}} of All Things Considered evening news magazine program. Shuster later joined the Washington-based Associated Press Radio Network, and the Africa Service of the Voice of America, before becoming the Geneva, Switzerland-based foreign correspondent of ABC News, first under ABC’s Paris Bureau Chief Pierre Salinger and later reporting directly to ABC Chief Foreign Correspondent Peter Jennings. For nine years with ABC Shuster worked in more than 40 developing countries covering mainly Africa, South and East Asia, and Latin America. In 1986, CNN Executive Producer Stuart Loory approached Scott Shuster for help with a new program he was planning, CNN World <b>Report</b> (<b>today</b> known as CNN World View). The program was to launch in 1987 and would feature news items produced by the (at that time largely government-owned) television broadcasters of a list of nations, eventually 150 countries. This content would be broadcast worldwide: On CNN in the US, on CNN International around the world, as well as on the government-owned broadcasting stations that contributed the material. Knowing of Shuster’s long experience as the guy in the Safari Suit reporting for ABC from the most distant lands, Loory asked Shuster to try to sign up government broadcasters in Africa in particular. Shuster visited and brought to CNN program contribution relationships with the television broadcasters of Senegal, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Zaire (today’s Democratic Republic of Congo), and with the government film unit of Chad (where there was as yet, no television).|$|E
