25|$|AF {{is often}} treated with {{medications}} {{to slow the}} heart rate to a near normal range (known as <b>rate</b> <b>control)</b> or to convert the rhythm to normal sinus rhythm (known as rhythm control).

40|$|Fluid bed coating {{has been}} shown to be a {{suitable}} manufacturing technique to formulate poorly soluble drugs in glass solutions. Layering inert carriers with a drug–polymer mixture enables these beads to be immediately filled into capsules, thus avoiding additional, potentially destabilizing, downstream processing. In this study, fluid bed coating is proposed for the production of controlled release dosage forms of glass solutions by applying a second, <b>rate</b> <b>controlling</b> membrane on top of the glass solution. Adding a second coating layer adds to the physical and chemical complexity of the drug delivery system, so a thorough understanding of the physical structure and phase behavior of the different coating layers is needed. This study aimed to investigate the surface and cross-sectional characteristics (employing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS)) of an indomethacin–polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) glass solution, top-coated with a release <b>rate</b> <b>controlling</b> membrane consisting of either ethyl cellulose or Eudragit RL. The implications of the addition of a pore former (PVP) and the coating medium (ethanol or water) were also considered. In addition, polymer miscibility and the phase analysis of the underlying glass solution were investigated. Significant differences in surface and cross-sectional topography of the different <b>rate</b> <b>controlling</b> membranes or the way they are applied (solution vs dispersion) were observed. These observations can be linked to the polymer miscibility differences. The presence of PVP was observed in all <b>rate</b> <b>controlling</b> membranes, even if it is not part of the coating solution. This could be attributed to residual powder presence in the coating chamber. The distribution of PVP among the sample surfaces depends on the concentration and the <b>rate</b> <b>controlling</b> polymer used. Differences can again be linked to polymer miscibility. Finally, it was shown that the underlying glass solution layer remains amorphous after coating of the <b>rate</b> <b>controlling</b> membrane, whether formed from an ethanol solution or an aqueous dispersion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Optimal {{structural}} superplasticity and the {{deformation of}} nanostruc-tured {{materials in the}} thermally activated region are regarded as being caused by the same physical process. In this analysis, grain/interphase boundary sliding con-trols the rate of deformation {{at the level of}} atomistics. Boundary sliding develops to a mesoscopic level by plane interface formation involving two or more boundaries and at this stage the <b>rate</b> <b>controlling</b> step is boundary migration. In other words, grain/interphase boundary sliding is viewed as a two-scale process. The non-zero, unbalanced shear stresses present at the grain/interphase boundaries ensure that near-random grain rotation is also a non-rate controlling concomitant of this mecha-nism. Expressions have been derived for the free energy of activation for the atomic scale <b>rate</b> <b>controlling</b> process, the threshold stress that should be crossed for the commencement of mesoscopic boundary sliding, the inverse Hall–Petch effect and the steady state rate equation connecting the strain rate to the independent vari-ables of stress, temperature and grain size. Beyond the point of inflection in the log stress–log strain <b>rate</b> plot, climb <b>controlled</b> multiple dislocation motion within the grains becomes increasingly important and at sufficiently high stresses becomes <b>rate</b> <b>controlling.</b> The predictions have been validated experimentally...|$|R
