30|$|By {{imposing}} {{higher taxes}} on the purchase of less efficient vehicles, <b>registration</b> <b>taxes</b> influence consumer behaviour directly {{at the point of}} vehicle sale. Denmark’s purchase-tax system led to an average fuel efficiency increase of 4.1  l/ 100  km for diesel light vehicles and 0.6  l/ 100  km for petrol [74]. Purchase or <b>registration</b> <b>taxes</b> are highly visible, which is very helpful in steering buyers’ decisions towards more efficient vehicles and may also result in lower car ownership rates: a 10  % increase in car <b>registration</b> <b>taxes</b> would reduce car ownership in European cities by about 1.4  % [74], which would, in turn, result in lower overall car use and a higher share of more efficient modes in urban areas. However, there may be negative welfare or equity implications [27]. Taxes imposed {{at the time of the}} first registration may also delay the renewal of the vehicle fleet, as car owners may keep their vehicles longer and may prefer to replace current vehicle with other used rather than new ones. An ex-post assessment of the Netherland’s feebates estimated the scheme saved approximately 0.6 - 1  m tonnes of CO 2 per annum [28], approximately 2 – 3  % of the Netherland’s total transport sector CO 2 emissions. The Dutch system’s provision of direct incentives to buy very efficient cars has had a measurable effect on purchasing decisions, with the market share of cars from the highest efficiency class increasing from 0.3 to 3.2  %, and that for the second highest class increasing from 9.5 to 16.1  % in 2002 [90]. Following the government’s decision to discontinue the feebates, efficient cars’ market share dropped almost instantly, although it stayed higher than before the scheme’s introduction [74].|$|R

Electric cars are also exempt from the <b>registration</b> <b>tax.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2010, Councillor Rob Ford won the mayoralty on {{promises}} to cut taxes. During his term, Council cancelled the vehicle <b>registration</b> <b>tax,</b> made various department 'essential services' and out-sourced some garbage pickup services. Council removed some of Ford's mayoral powers following the disclosures of Ford's drug abuse, giving powers to the deputy mayor. Although Ford ran for re-election, ill-health {{forced him to}} drop out. The mayoralty was won by John Tory, former leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservatives.|$|E
25|$|The first {{deliveries}} in {{the country}} occurred on August 22, 2013, at Tesla's European Distribution Center in Tilburg. A total of 1,194 units were sold in 2013. After {{the end of the}} <b>registration</b> <b>tax</b> exemption, sales fell significantly, and only 262 units were sold during the first four months of 2014. In April 2014 the Schiphol Group announced that three companies were selected to provide all-electric taxi service in Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The concessions started on June 1, 2014 and service is provided with 100 Tesla Model S cars, which jointed service to the electric buses and hybrid cars already operating at the airport.|$|E

25|$|The {{legal status}} of an ICE {{motorized}} bicycle in the United States is presently determined {{by the laws of}} each state and/or local jurisdiction. Several states allow ICE motorbikes to be operated on roadways without <b>registration,</b> <b>tax,</b> or licensing {{in the same manner as}} bicycles, providing certain restrictions are observed. Many state jurisdictions use limits on top speed and/or engine displacement to determine if ICE motorized bicycles require registration and licensing—sometimes as mopeds, sometimes as motorcycles. Some states prohibit the use of motorbikes on multi-use recreational paths or high-speed, limited access roadways, while others require additional safety equipment for operation on public roads, such as wearing a helmet. Many United States cities and other local jurisdictions may impose additional restrictions upon ICE motorized bicycles when operated on public streets and roadways.|$|E
2500|$|Electric {{vehicles}} weighing under 2,000kg {{are exempt}} from the new car <b>registration</b> <b>tax</b> since 1985, but available models were so limited that by 2009 only 497 EVs are registered in the entire country.

30|$|A Dutch {{policy paper}} on traffic and {{transport}} emissions[124] {{stated that it}} is not desirable for the diesel share in new passenger car sales to increase for air pollution concerns. The third national environmental policy plan (1998) targeted to reduce the diesel share of new passenger car sales from 11 % in 1998 to only 5 % in 2010 (G Geilenkirchen, personal communication). Dutch <b>registration</b> and circulation <b>taxes</b> for Diesel cars are close to prohibitive unless cars are driven a high mileage. Whereas the annual circulation tax for a gasoline car is approximately 600 €, it is double for a diesel car. Moreover, <b>registration</b> <b>taxes</b> have been 1868 € higher for diesel cars than for petrol cars. This tax is currently being transformed to a CO 2 -dependent tax, but a compensatory diesel penalty will persist. As a result of the fiscal policies, the share of diesel cars in the Netherlands has been much lower than the EU-average, varying between 20 % and 30 % (G Geilenkirchen, personal communication).|$|R
2500|$|All hybrid and {{electric}} vehicles {{are exempt from}} <b>registration</b> <b>tax.</b> The Government announced that from October 27, 2016, electric vehicles {{would be eligible for}} a 21% rebate of the gross purchase price, capped at a [...] ( [...] at the December 2016 exchange rate). Furthermore, to promote electric cars, the Government has added some other regulatory incentives, such as green license plates, and simplified tax and regulations on electric charge points. By 2020, the Government expects that there will be 30,000 environmentally friendly cars on Hungarian roads.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, the Dutch {{government}} set incentives such as {{the total}} exemption of the registration fee and road taxes, which resulted in savings of approximately [...] for private car owners over four years, and [...] for corporate owners over five years. Other vehicles including hybrid electric vehicles were also exempt from these taxes if they emit less than 95 g/km for diesel-powered vehicles, or less than 110 g/km for gasoline-powered vehicles. The exemption from the <b>registration</b> <b>tax</b> ended on January 1, 2014, and thereafter, all-electric vehicles pay a 4% registration fee and plug-in hybrids a 7% fee.|$|E
