50|$|Rock-quality {{designation}} (RQD) is a rough {{measure of}} the degree of jointing or fracture in a rock mass, measured {{as a percentage of the}} drill core in lengths of 10 cm or more. High-quality rock has an RQD of more than 75%, low quality of less than 50%.Rock quality designation (RQD) has several definitions. The most widely used definition was developed in 1964 by D. U.

The results of the experiment indicate that up to 37 % of the thermal energy used by a shower can be recovered with the system developed in this study. These results are based on a drainage water temperature of 101 °F (38 °C) and a supply water temperature of 76 °F (24 °C) at an average effluent mass flow rate of 6. 74 kg/s.
