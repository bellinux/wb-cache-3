40|$|Purpose: Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a preventable disease {{that can have}} improved outcomes with early diagnosis and treatment. The CDC recommends that HIV testing be incorporated into clinical settings as part of <b>routine</b> medical care. Methods: Individual, open-ended {{interviews were conducted with}} primary care providers and administrators to obtain their views regarding the meaning of <b>routine</b> HIV testing and the barriers and facilitators to implementing <b>routine</b> HIV testing in their respective practices. Results: Most respondents supported <b>routine</b> HIV testing, although their definitions of <b>routine</b> varied. Barriers for providers included time and financial constraints to appropriately conduct HIV counseling and testing and inadequate HIV education and training. Facilitators for implementing <b>routine</b> HIV testing included patients’ feelings of empowerment and reduced HIV stigma. Conclusions: The implementation of <b>routine</b> HIV testing in primary care practices appears to be an acceptable public health intervention. Next steps should include efforts to standardize the definition of <b>routine</b> HIV testing and working with primary care settings to better understand and reduce barriers to <b>routine</b> testing...|$|R
