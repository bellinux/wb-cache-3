40|$|Oil seed rape is an {{important}} non-cereal crop used mainly for edible oil production. Canola pods are fragile and its branches are twisted together at harvesting time. Harvesting with a conventional combine can pull off twisted branches and cause appreciable losses {{in the vicinity of}} divider at combine header. In this study, a hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>divider</b> was designed and developed to separate twisted pods and reduce the grain loss. The device is made up of two cylinders and a number of fingers, the cylinders rotate in opposite direction and fingers move in and out through holes on cylinder walls. The assembly was expected to separate the twisted pods and reduce grain loss. A hydraulic motor driven by combine hydraulic system was used to rotate the separating cylinders. The separating assembly was installed on righthand side of the combine harvester header. A split-plot experiment was used to evaluate the performance of the unit. Field tests were carried out at combine forward speed of 1. 5 kmh- 1. Variables were: cylinders rotary speed in three levels (50, 75 and 100 rpm), the number of fingers in three levels (16, 12 and 8), and the tests were conducted with and without combine reel. Two different positions of finger protrusion were also considered in field tests. The results were compared with those of a conventional combine header. The results show that the medium rotational speed (75 rpm) exhibited lowest seed loss. Furthermore, as the number of fingers increased, the seed loss tended to decrease. The seed loss also decreased in the presence of combine reel. Also, findings showed there is {{no significant difference between the}} two protrusions trajectories of fingers. A twenty percent decrease in seed loss was observed at rotary speed of 75 rpm and number of fingers of 16 in the presence of combine reel...|$|E
30|$|The second-cut PFAA hay was {{stored in}} square bales at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) and {{analyzed}} for PFAAs concentration at the Chemical and Veterinary Analytical Institute in Münster (Table  1). The PFAA-free hay (1 st cut) was cultivated and harvested from a PFAAs unpolluted farmland in Lower-Saxony, Germany, {{provided by the}} Department Institute of Physiology of the University of Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Foundation. For sample preparation, PFAA-free hay and PFAA hay were cut with a sheep shearing machine into small pieces of 0.5 – 1  cm. Thereafter, the hay were divided homogeneously into 10  g samples by a <b>rotary</b> sample <b>divider.</b>|$|R
30|$|Sixty {{samples were}} {{processed}} for coccolith analysis (at ~[*] 3  m intervals). Sediment samples were freeze-dried and prepared following combined dilution and filtering (Andruleit 1996), which enabled {{estimates of the}} absolute numbers of coccoliths per gram of dry sediment. Between 61 and 129  mg of dry bulk sediment was suspended in buffered water and treated ultrasonically for ~[*] 30  s. Samples were wet-split using a <b>rotary</b> sample <b>divider,</b> and 1 / 100 of the original solution was filtered through polycarbonate filters (0.45  μm pore size) with a vacuum pump. The filters were dried in an oven at ~[*] 40  °C for at least 24  h and stored. A small part of each filter was cut out, fixed on an aluminum stub, and sputtered with gold/palladium. Following a counting routine, a minimum of 400 coccoliths per sample were identified and classified under SEM at ×[*] 3000 magnification. However, in a few cases, this minimum number was not reached. Identification of coccoliths followed Young et al. (2003) and the electronic guide Nannotax 3 ([URL] TWC indicators included the taxa Calcidiscus leptoporus, Gephyrocapsa oceanica, and Helicosphaera carteri (Muza 1992).|$|R
40|$|The {{filtration}} {{technique is}} a widely applied method to calculate absolute coccolith abundances in paleoceanographic, paleoclimatic and ecological studies. Here, we have tested the accuracy and reproducibility of absolute coccolith abundance estimates obtained with the filtration method in combination with a <b>rotary</b> sample <b>divider.</b> The examination of two different filtration devices, a funnel and an in-line system, analysing a known number of microbeads per weight, revealed that counts obtained with funnel systems are up to Ø 18. 6 % too high. Repeated analyses (15 ×) of a fine-fraction sediment sample revealed {{a standard deviation of}} ± 11. 4 % for the in-line system and ± 15. 2 % for the funnel system, respectively. The comparison between three sub-samples (three splits of 1 / 30) showed a standard deviation of 4. 6 % for the in-line system and 9. 9 % for the funnel system, respectively. Therefore, we assume that the potential split error for the rotary splitter is ? 4. 6 %. The comparison of our results with estimates for the same samples analysed with the random settling and the “spiking with microbeads and spraying method” (SMS method) reveal that only the data obtained with the SMS and in-line filter method are statistically equal. The results obtained with the settling method are too low, whilst the results obtained with funnel filtration are too high in terms of coccolith absolute abundances. Our results confirm that the filtration method, including sample splitting with a rotary splitter, is a suitable method for the analysis of absolute coccolith abundances. However, the use of different filtration devices appears to affect the accuracy and reproducibility of the results. Furthermore, the number of splitting steps should be as small as possible to avoid an increase of error due to error propagation. In order to increase the reliability of the filtration method, we suggest calibrating a filtration device with microbeads as a standard measure. The reported reproducibility of the various preparation techniques may help to compare data sets obtained with different methods. <br/...|$|R
