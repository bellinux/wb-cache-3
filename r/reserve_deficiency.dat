40|$|The {{discount}} window refers to lending {{by each of}} the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks to depository institutions. Discount window loans generally fund {{only a small part}} of bank reserves. For example, during 1990 and 1991, {{discount window}} loans averaged just over 1 percent of total reserves. Nevertheless, the window is perceived as an important tool for reserve adjustment, and at times it has been an important part of the Federal Reserve's monetary control procedures. HOW THE DISCOUNT WINDOW WORKS Discount window lending takes place through the reserve accounts depository institutions are required to maintain at their Federal Reserve Banks. In other words, banks borrow reserves at the discount window. This is illustrated in balance sheet form in Table 1. Suppose the funding officer at Bob's Bank finds it has an unanticipated <b>reserve</b> <b>deficiency</b> of $ 1 million and decides to go to the discount window for an overnight loan in order to cover it. Once the loan is approved, Bob's Bank's reserve account is increased by $ 1 million. This shows up on the asset side of Bob's balance sheet as an increase in "Reserves with Federal Reserve Bank, " and on the liability side as an increase in "Borrowings from Federal Reserve Bank. " The transaction also shows up on the Federal Reserve Bank's balance sheet as an increase in "Discounts and Advances" on the asset side and an increase in "Bank Reserve Accounts " on the liability side. This set of balance shee...|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, {{federal funds}} are {{overnight}} borrowings between {{banks and other}} entities to maintain their bank reserves at the Federal Reserve. Banks keep reserves at Federal Reserve Banks to meet their reserve requirements and to clear financial transactions. Transactions in the federal funds market enable depository institutions with reserve balances in excess of reserve requirements to lend reserves to institutions with <b>reserve</b> <b>deficiencies.</b> These loans are usually made for one day only, that is, [...] "overnight". The interest rate at which these deals are done is called the federal funds rate. Federal funds are not collateralized; like eurodollars, they are an unsecured interbank loan.|$|R

40|$|Although {{there have}} been a large number of {{empirical}} studies of the demand for international reserves, there have not been many successful demonstrations that deviations of the actual stock of reserves from the target level defined by the demand function trigger a process of adjustment. This paper presents new evidence which suggests that central banks do have a target level of international reserve holdings, and that the adjustment of actual reserves towards the target level is quite rapid. In addition, an economic theory of the speed of adjustment is presented and tested. The evidence suggests that central banks adjust more rapidly to <b>reserve</b> <b>deficiencies</b> than to surpluses, that the speed of adjustment is positively related to the divergence between the actual level of reserves and the target level, and that countries which hold abnormally large quantities of reserves do so, in part, in order to adjust more slowly. Finally, the paper examines the applicability of the model to the current regime of managed flexible exchange rates. The evidence suggests that the move towards greater exchange rate flexibility has not significantly altered the reserve holding behavior of the world's central banks. ...|$|R

40|$|Of {{particular}} importance {{is the evidence}} that no small mammal species have been lost from the reserve in the last 26 years; Pseudomys albocinereus, Tarsipes rostratus and Sminthopsis (sp) p. were recorded in both years’ surveys. Records of P. albocinereus {{in this study are}} significant as they confirm the persistence of the species on the Dandaragan Plateau, whereas on the adjacent Swan Coastal Plain the species has not been recorded since 1987. Overall, the persistence of small mammals in this reserve, unlike the nearby reserves on the Swan Coastal Plain (SCP), could be attributed to the mix of vegetation types within the reserve and the larger size of Boonanarring Nature <b>Reserve.</b> However, <b>deficiencies</b> in the monitoring programme were identified. There is a need to improve the long-term monitoring of small mammals within the BNR with long-term, repeat-measures, analysis and reporting...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} {{of the life cycle}} life estimation concept was brought about by the need to improve the accuracy of life forecasts for certain types of telecommunication property. The main characteristic of these properties is that they are subject to rapid and cyclical technological change. In conjunction with the life cycle life estimation concept it has been necessary to reconsider the related capital recovery procedures. This study examines in detail a life cycle depreciation (LCD) model;Four steps are required for the model: Data analysis, life cycle forecasts, life estimation, and depreciation calculation. Among the four steps, the forecasts of the life cycles are the key to the accuracy of capital recovery. The depreciation rates are computed by the Investment Recovery Life (IRL) and the Remaining Investment Recovery Life (RmIRL) from the life estimation of a life cycle. The characteristics of the life cycle depreciation are also presented;The LCD model is compared with the conventional depreciation models, and is tested and validated using known property life cycles based on property experience simulated with Iowa type curves. The IRL is shown to be able to represent the overall life characteristics of the life cycle and to produce capital recovery results duplicating the broad group depreciation method. The results of the capital recovery studies on the simulated data also indicated that the LCD depreciation model is equivalent to the traditional vintage group depreciation if both have the same forecasting capabilities;Finally, the effects of life estimation on reserve requirements were examined by applying the life cycle depreciation model to the actual property data. The data were from crossbar, analog-ESS, and digital-ESS switching equipment accounts of several telecommunications companies. These analyses indicated that the actual prescribed depreciation rates have been too low to adequately recover the investment over the property 2 ̆ 7 s expected life. Tests were made to determine the sensitivity of the reserve level to errors in life cycle forecasting. All the companies experienced <b>reserve</b> <b>deficiencies</b> for their actually reported reserve levels even when excessively long life cycles were applied to the model;The life cycle depreciation model presented in this study has shown to be not only correct but also readily applicable...|$|R
40|$|As {{renewable}} {{electricity generation}} becomes more in demand on the market, {{the task of}} producing electricity without interruptions grows more complicated. Conditions like hours of sunshine and wind speed to supply solar and wind power plants cannot be accurately predicted or controlled. In order to maintain a reliable power supply, the supply network must be adapted if the expansion {{of these types of}} production is to be sustainable. The purpose of this report is to describe the approach to investigate and visualize how the Swedish electricity system is affected by the introduction of more renewable electricity generation. This has been done by studying a larger collection of scientific literature evaluated for its relevance and reliability, which has then been compiled into this report. After that, a model has been designed and integrated with a web interface to simulate and visualize Sweden's electricity supply. The results from the model show that large power reserves will be needed in the power system in order to compensate for the lack of power when wind and solar power conditions are less than desirable. In addition to power <b>reserves,</b> the <b>deficiency</b> can be addressed by expanding the transmission capacity in the Swedish grid, alternatively, power can be imported from neighboring countries. In conclusion, an exclusively renewable electricity generation without nuclear power is possible, but today's power grid needs to be expanded and developed to compensate for an increasingly unpredictable power generation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an interpretation}} of the Asian meltdown focused on moral hazard as the common source of overinvestment, excessive external borrowing, and current account deficits. To the extent that foreign creditors are willing to lend to domestic agents against future bail-out revenue from the government, unprofitable projects and cash shortfalls are refinanced through external borrowing. While public deficits need not be high before a crisis, the eventual refusal of foreign creditors to refinance the country's cumulative losses forces the government to step in and guarantee the outstanding stock of external liabilities. To satisfy solvency, the government must then undertake appropriate domestic fiscal reforms, possibly involving recourse to seigniorage revenues. Expectations of inflationary financing thus cause a collapse of the currency and anticipate the event of a financial crisis. The empirical section of the paper presents evidence in support of the thesis that weak cyclical performances, low foreign exchange <b>reserves,</b> and financial <b>deficiencies</b> resulting in high shares of nonperforming loans were {{at the core of the}} Asian collapse.

40|$|Purpose. A {{key factor}} {{contributing}} to the safety and quality of ergatic system "train-driver" is {{the intensity of the}} locomotive crew’s work. The aim of this work is formalization of locomotive driver activity tension indicator. Methodology. One of the characteristics of driver activity tension is the difference between the time allotted to complete the task, and the necessary (external <b>reserve</b> or <b>deficiency</b> time). The sets of major and minor operations in the management of the train locomotive in different train situations were identified. Using the methods of fuzzy logic, the concept of "materiality of the operation of the locomotive control" is presented {{in the form of a}} set of linguistic variables. To determine the function membership of the elements of the set "the importance of the operation of the locomotive control" the method of expert evaluations was used. Coefficient of temporary tension is presented in the form of fuzzy number L-R-type. Findings. It was found the value of the relative number of operations of locomotive control according to the distribution using the parameter of operation "importance". To determine the most tensioned mode of the driver ranking the traffic condition according to the parameter of relative amounts of the important management operations was conducted. The most difficult modes are the "front hindrance", "movement in unfavorable weather conditions" and "departure from the station to the running line". Originality. The introduction of the value "conventional importance of the operation" allowed us to more accurately describe the terms of train driving. For the first time the work presents determination of tension of the driver’s work in the form of a unimodal fuzzy number, which will make it possible to use the methods of the theory of artificial intelligence to simulate activity of the locomotive driver and develop intelligent control systems. Practical value. There were obtained the opportunity to consider such an important quality indicator, as "the tension of the driver’s work" in systems of automatic train control and traffic safety. Ranking the onboard situations and control operations enables us to justify the order of management action for the improvement of the algorithms of system operation of train driving...|$|R
