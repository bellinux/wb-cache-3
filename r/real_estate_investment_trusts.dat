5|$|The IMF has {{reported}} that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with higher interest rates. Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from higher interest rates and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short-term securities and in the shadow banking system (particularly the mortgage market and <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment</b> <b>trusts).</b> Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth {{so as not to}} provoke investor withdrawal.|$|E

500|$|Historically, in the United States, {{there had}} been a group of {{publicly}} traded private equity firms that were registered as business development companies (BDCs) under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

500|$|Enron used {{special purpose}} entities—limited {{partnerships}} or companies created {{to fulfill a}} temporary or specific purpose to fund or manage risks associated with specific assets. The company elected to disclose minimal details on its use of [...] "special purpose entities". These shell companies were created by a sponsor, but funded by independent equity investors and debt financing. For financial reporting purposes, a series of rules dictate whether a special purpose entity is a separate entity from the sponsor. In total, by 2001, Enron had used hundreds of special purpose entities to hide its debt. Enron used a number of special purpose entities, such as partnerships in its Thomas and Condor tax shelters, financial asset securitization investment trusts (FASITs) in the Apache deal, real estate mortgage investment conduits (REMICs) in the Steele deal, and REMICs and <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> (REITs) in the Cochise deal.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>real</b> <b>estate</b> <b>investment</b> <b>trusts</b> and royalty trusts, the {{distributions}} paid {{often will}} be consistently {{greater than the}} company earnings. This can be sustainable because the accounting earnings do not recognize any increasing value of real estate holdings and resource reserves. If there is no economic increase {{in the value of}} the company's assets then the excess distribution (or dividend) will be a return of capital and the book value of the company will have shrunk by an equal amount. [...] This may result in capital gains which may be taxed differently from dividends representing distribution of earnings.|$|E

40|$|A <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Trust</b> {{is simply}} a body that utilises {{collective}} funds to manage and purchase income producing properties. The terminology is widely recognised internationally, although in South Africa a structure exists which is not too dissimilar to the <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Trust,</b> the listed property sector in South Africa is undergoing a huge shift {{as a result of}} the more distinguished <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Trust</b> structure being proposed by the National Treasury. This report focuses on establishing whether the proposed structure is expected to have an impact on the listed property sector in South Africa. The hypothesis is tested through the use of literature and research pieces stemming from countries where the structure is currently in existence. The proposed South African <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Trust</b> structure is studied critically to determine the key issues that will impact on performance of a listed fund, and is also compared to a selection of existing structures around the world. The key findings were conclusive in that the <b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Trust</b> is expected to have a positive impact on the listed property sector...|$|R
2500|$|In addition, {{the capital}} gains tax {{decreased}} from rates of 8%, 10%, and 20% to 5% and 15%. Capital gains taxes for those currently paying 5% (in this instance, those in the 10% and 15% income tax brackets) are scheduled to be eliminated in 2008. However, capital gains taxes remain at the regular income tax rate for property held less than one year. Certain categories, such as collectibles, remained taxed at existing rates, with a 28% cap. In addition, taxes on [...] "qualified dividends" [...] were reduced to {{the capital gains}} levels.

2500|$|In the mid-20th century, {{with the}} rise of the suburb and {{automobile}} culture in the United States, a new style of shopping center was created away from downtown. Early shopping centers designed for the automobile include Market Square, Lake Forest, Illinois (1916), and Country Club Plaza, Kansas City, Missouri (1924). From early on, the design tended to be inward-facing, with malls following theories of how customers could best be enticed in a controlled environment. Similar, the concept of a mall having one or more [...] "anchor stores" [...] or [...] "big box stores" [...] was pioneered early, with individual stores or smaller-scale chain stores intended to benefit from the shoppers attracted by the big stores. Mall construction in America was encouraged by the accelerated depreciation laws of 1954, which incentivized greenfield development on the urban fringe. A second stimulus came from legislation passed in 1960, which allowed investors to band together in REITs (<b>Real</b> <b>Estate</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>Trusts)</b> to avoid corporate income taxes. The laws helped to shape the familiar exurban landscape of malls, motels, and fast food chains.|$|E
