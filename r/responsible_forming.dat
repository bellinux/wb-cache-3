Notwithstanding all these genuine intentions of responsibility or the generation of benefits, CSR is not altruism, and its main and ultimate concerns are {{the bottom line of}} profitability and the direct and indirect benefits to the business. For market actors, solving climate- and climate change-related problems is a desirable by-product not an inherent purpose (Twigg 2001).|$|R

With the phenomenology of Merleau-Ponty, bodily dimensions and enfleshed intercorporeality are seen as media for ethically enacted and morally responsive, thus <b>responsible</b> <b>forms</b> of practicing and relationships. Then the article discusses specific forms of responsive and caring practices as well as the ethical relevance of bodies at work in organisations. Finally, practical, political, and theoretical implications are offered and perspectives for further investigating and incorporating practicing of ethics in organisations are outlined...|$|R

The new wave of genomic tools and products (e. g., CRISPR, gene drives, RNAi, synthetic biology, and genetically modified [GM] insects and fish), provide a particularly useful opportunity to reflect on and revise agricultural biotechnology governance. In response, we present five essential features to advance more socially <b>responsible</b> <b>forms</b> of governance. In presenting these, we hope to stimulate further debate and action towards improved forms of governance, particularly as these new genomic tools and products continue to emerge...|$|R

It is intended that this study should suggest the chief ambitions of the thirties writers examined, namely the formulation of a socially <b>responsible</b> <b>form</b> of literature suiting the demands of their time, and evaluate their efforts to fulfil that ambition...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has revealed that}} management knowledge can be transferred across national borders {{as a result of}} different carriers, but also acknowledges that the institutional context of different countries can shape how management knowledge is diffused. We demonstrate the importance of macro institutional arrangements on the transfer of corporate social responsibility (CSR) to Australia since the early 1990 s. Taking examples of financial markets (socially <b>responsible</b> <b>forms</b> of investment) and international environmental management standards (International Standardization Organization certification) as illustrative of how CSR practices have been diffused in Australia, it is argued that the Australian institutional context has produced a limited transfer of CSR in a largely instrumental and legitimating form. 19 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Companies {{increasingly}} {{find themselves}} {{under pressure to}} adopt socially <b>responsible</b> <b>forms</b> of operation. Since organizational change is crucially influenced by knowledge creation and sense-making, this paper aims to determine how knowledge management (KM) processes can foster (or impede) progress towards corporate social responsibility (CSR). Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the KM literature to identify areas of knowledge management that are particularly relevant to managing a company's social and environmental externalities. Findings: Distinguishing between two related but analytically distinct approaches to knowledge management, namely an element and a process view, the paper develops a conceptual model of how knowledge management can impact on CSR. Originality/value: Distinguishing between elements of knowledge and processes of managing these allows a more systematic and comprehensive approach to managing knowledge around CSR...|$|R
