30|$|In {{the case}} of the YES project, which is an example of {{community}} participation in SWM, the study shows that each participating household is encouraged to separate both <b>recyclables</b> (either organic, <b>plastics,</b> metals) and non-recyclables. Generally, some of the <b>recyclables</b> (<b>plastics,</b> WEEE, and metals) are sold directly at the household level to prospective itinerant waste buyers who roam the community on daily basis, while the mixed waste and organic materials are collected by the trained community waste pickers for a fee. These service providers haul waste from registered household sources to the composting facility. This is effectively carried out by pre-collection services using the tricycles acquired through the YES project.|$|R

5000|$|Many {{geosynthetic}} aggregates {{are also}} {{made from recycled}} materials. Being polymer based, <b>recyclable</b> <b>plastics</b> can be reused {{in the production of}} these new age of aggregates. For example, Ring Industrial Group's EZflow product lines are produced with geosynthetic aggregate pieces that are more than 99.9% recycled polystyrene. This polystyrene, that would have otherwise been destined for a landfill, is instead gathered, melted, mixed, reformulated and expanded to create low density aggregates that maintain high strength properties while under compressive loads. Such geosynthetic aggregates replace conventional gravel while simultaneously increasing porosity, increasing hydraulic conductivity and eliminating the fine dust [...] "fines" [...] inherent to gravel aggregates which otherwise serve to clog and disrupt the operation of many drainage applications.|$|R

40|$|Plastic {{pollution}} {{represents a}} major and growing global problem. It is well-known that plastics {{are a source}} of chemical contaminants to the aquatic environment and provide novel habitats for marine organisms. The present study quantified the impacts of plastic leachates from the seven categories of <b>recyclable</b> <b>plastics</b> on larval survival and settlement of barnacle Amphibalanus (=Balanus) amphitrite. Leachates from plastics significantly increased barnacle nauplii mortality at the highest tested concentrations (0. 10 and 0. 50 m(2) /L). Hydrophobicity (measured as surface energy) was positively correlated with mortality indicating that plastic surface chemistry may be an important factor in the effects of plastics on sessile organisms. Plastic leachates significantly inhibited barnacle cyprids settlement on glass at all tested concentrations. Settlement on plastic surfaces was significantly inhibited after 24 and 48 h, but settlement was not significantly inhibited compared to the controls for some plastics after 72 - 96 h. In 24 h exposure to seawater, we found larval toxicity and inhibition of settlement with all seven categories of <b>recyclable</b> commercial <b>plastics.</b> Chemical analysis revealed a complex mixture of substances released in plastic leachates. Leaching of toxic compounds from all plastics should be considered when assessing the risks of plastic pollution...|$|R

25|$|Environmental {{considerations}} of wine packaging reveal benefits and drawbacks of both bottled and box wines. The glass {{used to make}} bottles is a nontoxic, naturally occurring substance that is completely <b>recyclable,</b> whereas the <b>plastics</b> used for box-wine containers are typically much less environmentally friendly. However, wine-bottle manufacturers have been cited for Clean Air Act violations. A New York Times editorial suggested that box wine, being lighter in package weight, has a reduced carbon footprint from its distribution; however, box-wine plastics, even though possibly recyclable, can be more labor-intensive (and therefore expensive) to process than glass bottles. In addition, while a wine box is <b>recyclable,</b> its <b>plastic</b> bladder most likely is not.|$|R

50|$|The BEACH was an {{interactive}} architectural installation art designed by Snarkitecture for the National Building Museum in July 2015. Taking cues from the familiar {{experience of a}} summer day at the beach, Snarkitecture abstracted both the natural and cultural elements of the beach to create a reduced, monochromatic environment inside the museum’s Great Hall. Standard construction materials like scaffolding, drywall, and mirrors were utilized to create the enclosure that led to an ocean of 750,000 <b>recyclable</b> <b>plastic</b> balls. The BEACH welcomed visitors to explore, play and relax in a fully immersive and unique setting.|$|E
50|$|In the Eskilstuna municipality, all {{household}} {{solid waste}} is recycled with optical color sorting since 2011, {{which is a}} new way of recycling. Each waste fraction has its own colored <b>recyclable</b> <b>plastic</b> bag and is disposed of in the same garbage bin. By using optical color sorting, house owners are able to sort out organic food waste, plastic, metal and paper packaging, newspapers and household waste. The organic food waste is then used to produce biogas and the other five fractions are recycled and reused. The system of six different fractions is unique of its kind in Europe.|$|E

50|$|From the 1960s onward in the United States, with {{improvements}} in shipping and storage materials, glass bottles have almost completely {{been replaced with}} either LDPE coated paper cartons or <b>recyclable</b> HDPE <b>plastic</b> containers (such as square milk jugs), depending on the brand. These paper and plastic containers are lighter, cheaper and safer to both manufacture and ship to consumers.|$|R
50|$|Polypropylene (PP) {{is useful}} for such diverse {{products}} as reusable plastic food containers, microwave- and dishwasher-safe plastic containers, diaper lining, sanitary pad lining and casing, ropes, carpets, plastic moldings, piping systems, car batteries, insulation for electrical cables and filters for gases and liquids. In medicine, it is used in hernia treatment and to make heat-resistant medical equipment. Polypropylene sheets are used for stationery folders and packaging and clear storage bins. Polypropylene {{is defined by the}} <b>recyclable</b> <b>plastic</b> number 5. Although relatively inert, it is vulnerable to ultraviolet radiation and can degrade considerably in direct sunlight. Polypropylene is not as impact-resistant as the polyethylenes (HDPE, LDPE). It is also somewhat permeable to highly volatile gases and liquids.|$|E
50|$|The {{implementation}} of reusable plastic containers arises {{as a consequence}} of concerns with sustainability and environmental impact. Use of <b>recyclable</b> <b>plastic</b> packages is beneficial environmentally but is more expensive. The adoption of reusable plastic containers will amount to an approximate annual increase of 0.058 euros/kg of delivered goods. The cost associated with reusable plastic containers are packaging purchasing costs, transportation costs, labor/handling costs, management costs, and costs resulting from losses. Packaging purchasing costs encompasses the cost of the containers as well as any associated service costs. This cost is reoccurring but is only relevant once every 50 cycles, which is the typical lifetime of reusable plastic containers. One cycle consists of the initial stages of processing plastic containers {{all the way to the}} use and recycling of these containers by the consumers. Transportation costs are slightly higher for reusable plastic containers as compared to traditional use and throwaway plastic containers in that these reusable containers need additional transportation to recycling facilities. Reusable plastic containers also require work loading and unloading from trucks as well as quality inspection, this adds additional labor costs. Management costs exists because reusable plastic container stock count needs to be managed. The final cost of reusable plastic containers is the cost incurred when packages are lost or there are errors within the management system. Figure 2 provides a detailed summary of the costs associated with adopting reusable plastic containers.|$|E
