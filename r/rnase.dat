5|$|This ring {{structure}} {{is very similar}} to that of the proteins <b>RNase</b> PH and PNPase. In bacteria, the protein <b>RNase</b> PH, which is involved in tRNA processing, forms a hexameric ring consisting of six identical <b>RNase</b> PH proteins. In the case of PNPase, which is a phosphorolytic RNA-degrading protein found in bacteria and the chloroplasts and mitochondria of some eukaryotic organisms, two <b>RNase</b> PH domains, and both an S1 and KH RNA binding domain are part of a single protein, which forms a trimeric complex that adopts a structure almost identical to that of the exosome. Because of this high similarity in both protein domains and structure, these complexes are thought to be evolutionarily related and have a common ancestor. In bacteria, a separate <b>RNase</b> PH protein exists that is involved in transfer RNA processing, which has been shown to adopt a similar six-membered ring structure, but in this case consisting of 6 identical protein subunits. The <b>RNase</b> PH-like exosome proteins, PNPase and <b>RNase</b> PH all belong to the <b>RNase</b> PH family of RNases and are phosphorolytic exoribonucleases, meaning that they use inorganic phosphate to remove nucleotides from the 3' end of RNA molecules.|$|E
5|$|As stated above, the exosome complex {{contains}} many proteins with ribonuclease domains. The {{exact nature of}} these ribonuclease domains has changed across evolution from bacterial to archaeal to eukaryotic complexes as various activities have been gained and lost. The exosome is primarily a 3'-5' exoribonuclease, meaning that it degrades RNA molecules from their 3' end. Exoribonucleases contained in exosome complexes are either phosphorolytic (the <b>RNase</b> PH-like proteins) or, in eukaryotes, hydrolytic (the <b>RNase</b> R and <b>RNase</b> D domain proteins). The phosphorolytic enzymes use inorganic phosphate to cleave the phosphodiester bonds - releasing nucleotide diphosphates. The hydrolytic enzymes use water to hydrolyse these bonds - releasing nucleotide monophosphates.|$|E
5|$|In these diseases, {{antibodies}} {{are mainly}} directed against {{two of the}} proteins of the complex, called PM/Scl-100 (the <b>RNase</b> D like protein) and PM/Scl-75 (one of the <b>RNase</b> PH like proteins from the ring) and antibodies recognizing these proteins are found in approximately 30% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome. Although these two proteins are the main target of the autoantibodies, other exosome subunits and associated proteins (like C1D) can be targeted in these patients. At the current time, the most sensitive way to detect these antibodies is by using a peptide, derived from the PM/Scl-100 protein, as the antigen in an ELISA, instead of complete proteins. By this method, autoantibodies are found in up to 55% of patients with the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, {{but they can also}} be detected in patients suffering from either scleroderma, polymyositis, or dermatomyositis alone.|$|E

40|$|Ribonuclease {{inhibitor}} (RI) is a conserved protein of the mammalian cytosol. RI binds {{with high}} affinity to diverse secretory ribonucleases (<b>RNases)</b> and inhibits their enzymatic activity. Although secretory <b>RNases</b> {{are found in}} all vertebrates, {{the existence of a}} non-mammalian RI has been uncertain. Here, we report on the identification and characterization of RI homologs from chicken and anole lizard. These proteins bind to <b>RNases</b> from multiple species but exhibit much greater affinity for their cognate <b>RNases</b> than for mammalian <b>RNases.</b> To reveal the basis for this differential affinity, we determined the crystal structure of mouse, bovine, and chicken RI·RNase complexes to a resolution of 2. 20, 2. 21, and 1. 92  Å, respectively. A combination of structural, computational, and bioinformatic analyses enabled the identification of two residues that appear to contribute to the differential affinity for <b>RNases.</b> We also found marked differences in oxidative instability between mammalian and non-mammalian RIs, indicating evolution toward greater oxygen sensitivity in RIs from mammalian species. Taken together, our results illuminate the structural and functional evolution of RI, along with its dynamic role in vertebrate biology...|$|R

5|$|The core of {{the complex}} has a ring {{structure}} consisting of six proteins that all {{belong to the same}} class of RNases, the <b>RNase</b> PH-like proteins. In archaea there are two different PH-like proteins (called Rrp41 and Rrp42), each present three times in an alternating order. Eukaryotic exosome complexes have six different proteins that form the ring structure. Of these six eukaryotic proteins, three resemble the archaeal Rrp41 protein and the other three proteins are more similar to the archaeal Rrp42 protein.|$|E
5|$|Type I toxin-antitoxin systems {{rely on the}} base-pairing of {{complementary}} antitoxin RNA {{with the}} toxin's mRNA. Translation of the mRNA is then inhibited either by degradation via <b>RNase</b> III or by occluding the Shine-Dalgarno sequence or ribosome binding site. Often the toxin and antitoxin are encoded on opposite strands of DNA. The 5' or 3' overlapping region between the two genes is the area involved in complementary base-pairing, usually with between 19–23 contiguous base pairs.|$|E
40|$|T 2 -type <b>RNases</b> are {{responsible}} for self-pollen recognition and rejection in three distantly related families of flowering plants—the Solanaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and Rosaceae. We used phylogenetic analyses of 67 T 2 -type <b>RNases</b> together with information on intron number and position {{to determine whether the}} use of <b>RNases</b> for self-incompatibility in these families is homologous or convergent. All methods of phylogenetic reconstruction as well as patterns of variation in intron structure find that all self-incompatibility <b>RNases</b> along with non-S genes from only two taxa form a monophyletic clade. Several lines of evidence suggest that the best interpretation of this pattern is homology of self-incompatibility <b>RNases</b> from the Scrophulariaceae, Solanaceae, and Rosaceae. Because the most recent common ancestor of these three families is the ancestor of ≈ 75 % of dicot families, our results indicate that RNase-based self-incompatibility was the ancestral state in the majority of dicots...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMany ribonucleases (<b>RNases)</b> {{are highly}} cytotoxic. In some cases, they attack {{selectively}} malignant cells, triggering apoptotic response, and therefore are considered as alternative chemotherapeutic drugs. Factors that determine the cytotoxicity of <b>RNases,</b> primarily {{of those of}} microbial origin, are reviewed here. These factors include catalytic activity, ability to escape natural inhibitors, stability, and efficiency of internalization.

5|$|Chemical {{activity}} occurs along a protein's active site. Traditional drug design methods involve tightly binding to {{this site}} and blocking its activity, {{under the assumption}} that the target protein exists in one rigid structure. However, this approach works for approximately only 15% of all proteins. Proteins contain allosteric sites which, when bound to by small molecules, can alter a protein's conformation and ultimately affect the protein's activity. These sites are attractive drug targets, but locating them is very computationally costly. In 2012, Folding@home and MSMs were used to identify allosteric sites in three medically relevant proteins: beta-lactamase, interleukin-2, and <b>RNase</b> H.|$|E
5|$|In archaea, the Rrp41 subunit of {{the complex}} is a phosphorolytic exoribonuclease. Three copies of this protein {{are present in the}} ring and are {{responsible}} for the activity {{of the complex}}. In eukaryotes, none of the <b>RNase</b> PH subunits have retained this catalytic activity, meaning the core ring structure of the human exosome has no enzymatically active protein. Despite this loss of catalytic activity, the structure of the core exosome is highly conserved from archea to humans, suggesting that the complex performs a vital cellular function. In eukaryotes, the absence of the phosphorolytic activity is compensated by the presence of the hydrolytic enzymes, which are responsible for the ribonuclease activity of the exosome in such organisms.|$|E
5|$|In many bacteria, both mRNAs and non-coding RNAs can be polyadenylated. This poly(A) tail {{promotes}} degradation by the degradosome, {{which contains}} two RNA-degrading enzymes: polynucleotide phosphorylase and <b>RNase</b> E. Polynucleotide phosphorylase binds to the 3' end of RNAs and the 3' extension {{provided by the}} poly(A) tail allows it to bind to the RNAs whose secondary structure would otherwise block the 3' end. Successive rounds of polyadenylation and degradation of the 3' end by polynucleotide phosphorylase allows the degradosome to overcome these secondary structures. The poly(A) tail can also recruit RNases that cut the RNA in two. These bacterial poly(A) tails are about 30 nucleotides long.|$|E

5|$|Folding@home is {{assisting}} in research towards preventing some viruses, such as influenza and HIV, from recognizing and entering biological cells. In 2011, Folding@home began simulations {{of the dynamics}} of the enzyme <b>RNase</b> H, a key component of HIV, to try to design drugs to deactivate it. Folding@home has also been used to study membrane fusion, an essential event for viral infection and a wide range of biological functions. This fusion involves conformational changes of viral fusion proteins and protein docking, but the exact molecular mechanisms behind fusion remain largely unknown. Fusion events may consist of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds. This complexity limits typical computer simulations to about ten thousand atoms over tens of nanoseconds: a difference of several orders of magnitude. The development of models to predict the mechanisms of membrane fusion will assist in the scientific understanding of how to target the process with antiviral drugs. In 2006, scientists applied Markov state models and the Folding@home network to discover two pathways for fusion and gain other mechanistic insights.|$|E
