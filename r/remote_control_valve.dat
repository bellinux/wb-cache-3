40|$|Corrosion, poor pipe joints or {{insufficient}} {{thrust restraint}} all cause minor leakage in water pipelines. Minor leakage {{is difficult to}} eliminate because it is small and distributed. On the other hand, aged or weakened pipes may be broken accidentally because of excessive pressure, external loads, water hammer, frost or construction excavation. This emergency leakage requires rapid attention because large volumes of water may be lost. Potential for damage to other structures due to flooding or soil (slope) failures, or risk to trafKc from flooding or icing of road surfaces is also increased. In addition, in areas of significant traffic congestion, e. g. many Asian cities, it may take one or more hours to dispatch a repair crew to the site. The proposed model {{may be used in}} conjunction with a geographical information system (GIS), a monitoring/alarm system and a <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> system to form an integrated leakage detection and control system which can automatically reduce water losses and risks associated with emergency leakage. The proposed model minimizes discrete leakage while satisfying mass and energy conservation constraints. Piezometric pressure heads at the leakage points are the decision variables. The minor leakage problem can be solved as a special case of the discrete leakage minimization problem...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{availability}} on {{the market}} of <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> <b>valves</b> for water distribution systems allows a more flexible implementation of the “divide and conquer” paradigm, that consists in dividing large networks into smaller district meter areas defining a water network partitioning (WNP), aiming at controlling water balance, pressure levels and water quality protection. The positioning of gate valves is carried out using optimization approaches to guarantee the network reliability that can be significantly reduced by WNP owing to the closure of several pipes by means of gate valves, decreasing topologic and energy redundancy. Anyway, starting from the optimal positioning of <b>remote</b> <b>controlled</b> gate <b>valves,</b> obtained with SWANP software, the paper investigates the effectiveness of dynamic control, in order to face hydraulic failure in fire estinguishment. The proposed methodology, based on heuristic optimization algorithm, finds the optimal layouts minimizing the number of valves to be opened and maximizing the system performance. The study highlights the advantages of adaptively reconfigurable networks starting from a partitioned system, confirming that a dynamic control represents a significant improvement for smart water networks...|$|R

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{method for}} {{the preparation of}} elastomeric magnetic films with increased magneto-responsivity is presented. Polymeric films containing aligned magnetic microchains throughout their thickness are formed upon the magnetophoretic transport and assembly of microparticles during polymer curing. The obtained films are subsequently magnetized at a high magnetic field of 3 T directed parallel to {{the orientation of the}} microchains. We prove that the combination of both alignment of the particles along a favorable direction during curing and the subsequent magnetization of the solid films induces an impressive increase of the films’ deflection. Specifically, the displacements reach few millimeters, up to 85 times higher than those of the nontreated films with the same particle concentration. Such a process can improve the performance of the magnetic films without increasing the amount of magnetic fillers and, thus, without compromising the mechanical properties of the resulting composites. The proposed method can be used for the fabrication of magnetic films suitable as components in systems in which large displacements at relatively low magnetic fields are required, such as sensors and drug delivery or microfluidic systems, especially where <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> of <b>valves</b> is requested to achieve appropriate flow and mixing of liquids...|$|R

40|$|Surge is an {{aerodynamic}} flow instability {{which can}} lead to the catastrophic failure of the compressor sys-tem. One way to cope with this compressor flow instability is active control. For a laboratory-scale gas turbine installation, an active surge control system is proposed which consists of a plenum pressure sensor and a bleedhecycle valve. This work focuses on the selection of a <b>control</b> <b>valve.</b> More specifically, the required bandwidth and capacity of the valve are specified. To study the influence of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> on system behavior, simulations are done with the Greitzer model which describes the behavior of the nonlinear compression system during surge. This model is extended with a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> model which accounts for the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics and the effect of valve saturation. A linear static output feedback controller is used to stabilize the compression system around its nominal operating point. The main contributions of this study are the following. First, a systematic approach is presented to deter-mine the required bandwidth and capacity of a <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> for active surge control. Second, an efficient control strategy is applied: one-sided control. In this control strategy, the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> is nominally closed and only opens to stabilize the system in its nominal operating point. Third, a stability analysis of the constrained linearized compression system is presented. Using the bounded static output feedback controller, surge limit cycles are stabilized in the nominal operat-ing point. Stable operation can be sustained in this point with zero <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> mass flow if disturbances are absent. From simulations, the minimal bandwidth and capacity of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> needed for stabi-lization are determined. Surge point mass flow is seen to reduce by approximately 15 % with the applied one-sided control strategy. Furthermore, it is concluded that nonlinear flow curves of the <b>control</b> <b>valve</b> are unfavorable for active surge control...|$|R
