5|$|Shortly {{after the}} JTWC issued their final {{advisory}} on Lucille, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system near Luzon as a tropical depression. By May28, <b>radiosonde</b> data from Clark Air Base in Luzon {{indicated that the}} second system acquired a closed circulation at the 500mb level and began moving northeastward. While crossing the northern Philippines, the two systems merged and became a single cyclone, retaining the name Lucille. During its passage of the country, winds up to 63km/h (39mph) were reported in Manila. Once back over open waters, the system intensified as it accelerated northeastward, attaining tropical storm intensity early on May30.|$|E
5|$|On June26, 2005, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} {{a tropical}} wave well-inland over Africa. The feature was tracked via <b>radiosonde</b> observations from various nations {{for two days}} before being analyzed as a surface feature on June28 over western Senegal. Accompanied by scattered convection—shower and thunderstorm activity—the westward moving system featured some cyclonic flow; it emerged over the Atlantic Ocean early on June29. Conflicting observations from Dakar, Senegal, made tracking the wave difficult, with surface observations revealing a clear shift in wind direction and upper-level soundings showing no change. Regardless of the exact position of the system, accompanying convection soon diminished and the system became ill-defined. By June30, the system grew significantly and multiple low-level circulations developed within the broader cyclonic envelope. Weather models at the time depicted a low probability of tropical cyclogenesis in the subsequent days. Gradual development ensued over the following days, though the broad circulation initially remained largely devoid of convection due to dry air associated with the Saharan Air Layer.|$|E

500|$|The {{origin of}} Hurricane Mitch {{can be traced}} to a {{tropical}} wave [...] an elongated area of low air pressure moving from east to west [...] that moved through western Africa on October8, as evidenced by <b>radiosonde</b> data. On October10, the wave exited the coast, and it continued generally westward without development due to strong wind shear. The wave reached the eastern Caribbean Sea on October18, and over the subsequent few days developed an organizing area of convection, or thunderstorms. The system organized enough to prompt a Hurricane Hunters investigation, which observed a small circulation center and flight-level tropical storm force winds. As a result, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) estimated the system had developed into a tropical cyclone by 0000UTC on October22, located 415mi (665km) south of Kingston, Jamaica.|$|E

After his discovery, Scherhag assembled a team of meteorologists specifically to study the stratosphere at the Free University of Berlin. This group continued to map the northern-hemisphere stratospheric temperature and geopotential height for many years using <b>radiosondes</b> and rocketsondes. In 1979 when the satellite era began, meteorological measurements became far more frequent. Although satellites were primarily used for the troposphere they also recorded data for the stratosphere.

We compare temperatures obtained from surface observations and <b>radiosondes</b> as well as satellite-based measurements.

Deep-layer average temperatures equivalent to those obtained from the microwave sounding unit (MSU) channels 2 _L_T, representing the lower troposphere, 2 (middle troposphere) and 4 (lower stratosphere) are computed from the reanalyses. The estimation of global decadal temperature trends from surface measurements, <b>radiosondes,</b> satellite observations or reanalyses is subject to a considerable degree of uncertainty. Each of these observing systems contributes to this uncertainty. A close agreement of lower tropospheric temperature trends from the MSU, from <b>radiosondes</b> and from both reanalyses is found in the data rich regions of the Northern Hemisphere, where MSU and reanalysis data can be regarded as virtually independent. In regions without sufficient conventional observations from <b>radiosondes,</b> temperature trends cannot reliably be estimated from reanalyses. (orig.) 64 refs.
