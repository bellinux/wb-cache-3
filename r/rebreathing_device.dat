50|$|This device may be {{configured}} as a mine-laying system (particularly for attaching limpet mines {{directly to}} a ship) or as a torpedo, or {{may be used for}} intelligence gathering in harbours. They have also been used to plant listening and recording devices on undersea cables (see Operation Ivy Bells). For such military use, the operator will use a <b>rebreathing</b> <b>device</b> so as not to leave a trail of bubbles. Such devices are deployed from a service ship or a specially outfitted conventional submarine. An example is the Multi-Role Combatant Craft (MRCC) from STIDD Systems in the US STIDD.|$|E
40|$|Transient hypercapnic hyperoxemia was induced in two Rett {{syndrome}} {{children by}} the administration of a gaseous mixture of 80 percent O 2 and 20 percent CO 2. Time course studies of neurotransmitters and their metabolites showed an immediate and marked increase in central biogenic amine turnover following inhalation of the gas mixture. The increased turnover of biogenic amines was associated with improved clinical changes. This suggests a coupled relationship and provides further support for an etiological role of neurotransmitter dysfunction in Rett syndrome. In a complementary study, elevation of pulmonary CO 2 by application of a simple <b>rebreathing</b> <b>device</b> resulted in improvement of abnormal blood gases and elimination of the Cheyne-Stokes-like respiratory pattern of the Rett syndrome. Near normalization of the EEG occurred when a normal respiratory pattern was imposed {{by means of a}} respirator. Taken together, these results lead to the preliminary conclusion that cerebral hypoxemia secondary to abnormal respiratory function may contribute to diminished production of biogenic amines in Rett syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The 6 minutes walk test (6 MWT) {{is often}} {{shown to be}} the best {{predictor}} of mortality in pulmonary hypertension (PH) probably because it challenges the failing heart to deliver adequate cardiac output. We hypothesised that the 6 MWT elicits maximal cardiac output as measured during a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET). Methods: 18 patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (n = 12) or pulmonary arterial hypertension (n = 6) and 10 healthy subjects performed a 6 MWT and CPET with measurements of cardiac output (non invasive <b>rebreathing</b> <b>device)</b> before and directly after exercise. Heart rate was measured during 6 MWT with a cardiofrequence meter. Results: Cardiac output and heart rate measured {{at the end of the}} 6 MWT were linearly related to 6 MW distance (mean 6 SD: 490687 m). Patients with a high NT-pro-BNP achieve a maximum cardiac output during the 6 MWT, while in normal subjects and in patients with a low-normal NT-proBNP, cardiac output at the end of a 6 MWT was lower than achieved at maximum exercise during a CPET. In both cases, heart rate is the major determinant of exercise-induced increase in cardiac output. However, stroke volume increased during CPET in healthy subjects, not in PH patients. Conclusion: Maximal cardiac output is elicited by 6 MWT in PH patients with failing right ventricle. Cardiac output increase is dependent on chronotropic response in patients with PH...|$|E
50|$|Gaffney's 15 {{years of}} {{experience}} in cardiac research and operation of equipment such as echocardiograms and <b>rebreathing</b> <b>devices</b> led to his being selected as a payload specialist aboard STS-40 Spacelab Life Sciences (SLS 1), a mission which took place in June 1991. STS-40 was the first Spacelab mission dedicated to biomedical studies. Gaffney was a co-investigator on an experiment that studied human cardiovascular adaption to space flight. The SLS-1 mission flew over 3.2 million miles in 146 orbits and its crew completed over 18 experiments in nine days, bringing back more medical data than any previous NASA flight. Mission duration was 218 hours, 14 minutes and 20 seconds.|$|R
