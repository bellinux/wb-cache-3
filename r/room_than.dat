5|$|Guinea pigs (called cuy, cuye, or curí) were {{originally}} domesticated for their {{meat in the}} Andes. Traditionally, the animal was reserved for ceremonial meals by indigenous people in the Andean highlands, but since the 1960s, {{it has become more}} socially acceptable for consumption by all people. It continues to be {{a major part of the}} diet in Peru and Bolivia, particularly in the Andes Mountains highlands; it is also eaten in some areas of Ecuador (mainly in the Sierra) and Colombia. Because guinea pigs require much less <b>room</b> <b>than</b> traditional livestock and reproduce extremely quickly, they are a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals, such as pigs and cattle; moreover, they can be raised in an urban environment. Both rural and urban families raise guinea pigs for supplementary income, and the animals are commonly bought and sold at local markets and large-scale municipal fairs.|$|E
5|$|Turbo-electric {{propulsion}} {{was selected}} for the battlecruisers despite the fact it needed more <b>room</b> <b>than</b> geared turbines to allow for better underwater protection that wartime experience showed was essential. First used in the s, it also had several other advantages. The turbines could run at their optimum speed, without regard to propeller speed, which was economical on fuel and the machinery could be easily sub-divided which increased the ships' ability to withstand torpedo hits. The substitution of flexible electric cables for bulky steam-lines meant that the motors could be mounted further {{to the rear of}} the ship, which reduced both vibration and weight by shortening the propeller shafts. Also, the ship could go astern at full power simply by reversing the electrical polarity of the motors. Despite these factors and the fact that American companies would have struggled to produce the very large geared steam turbines needed for such big ships, the Curtis Company tried unsuccessfully to convince the Navy to reverse this decision. The Navy countered that doing so would mean a complete rearrangement of machinery spaces and a reduction in underwater protection.|$|E
500|$|The club {{finished}} third outside the promotion spots in Shankly's first part-season (1959/60). He released 24 players at the season's end. As well as Callaghan and Hunt he also retained Gerry Byrne. Shankly recognising {{the abilities of}} the existing coaching team of Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan and Reuben Bennett retained all three. An Anfield boot storage room was adopted as a strategy discussion venue by him and his coaches. The Boot Room, as it became known, became integral to their success. Bob Paisley remarked, [...] "You got a more wide-ranging discussion in the Boot <b>Room</b> <b>than</b> the boardroom. What went on was kept within those four walls. There was a certain mystique about the place." ...|$|E

500|$|Schmittou wanted [...] "to put Nashville in {{contention}} {{for a future}} major league team." [...] Along with this goal, {{the need for more}} seating, and a desire to make Greer a more attractive ballpark, significant renovations began after the 1987 season. The number of box seats was increased by 40%, the clubhouse and umpire facilities were upgraded, and the dugouts were entirely rebuilt. The new dugouts took up slightly more <b>room</b> <b>than</b> the previous ones, resulting in a minor contraction of the field's dimensions: 327feet (100m) down the left and right field lines, 371feet (113m) to left and right-center fields, and 400feet (120m) to center field. The stadium's main concourse entrance was redesigned to incorporate the stonemasonry of the adjacent Fort Negley. This expansion brought Greer's total seating capacity up to 18,000.|$|E
500|$|The {{cockatoo}} {{would have}} been a rare bird at the time, [...] "and one whose life would never in reality have been risked in an experiment such as this". It did not become well-known until after it was shown in illustrations to the accounts of the voyages of Captain Cook in the 1770s. Prior to Cook's voyage, cockatoos had been imported only in small numbers as exotic cage-birds. Wright had painted one in 1762 at the home of William Chase, featuring it both in his portrait of Chase and his wife (Mr & Mrs William Chase) and a separate study, The Parrot. In selecting such a rarity for this scientific sacrifice, Wright not only chose a more dramatic subject than the [...] "lungs-glass", but was perhaps making a statement about the values of society in the Age of Enlightenment. The white plumage of the cockatoo also shows much more effectively in the darkened <b>room</b> <b>than</b> the small dull-coloured bird in Wright's early oil sketch. A resemblance has been pointed out between the group of the bird and the two nearest figures and a type of depiction of the Trinity found in Early Netherlandish painting, where the Holy Spirit is represented by a dove, to which God the Father (the philosopher) points, while Christ (the father) gestures in blessing to the viewer.|$|E

2500|$|Critics {{have also}} pointed out that the show lacks visual punch. People interviewed in the show declare that they [...] "feel" [...] a spirit next to them, but nothing is shown to the TV viewer. In the series debut, the {{audience}} is told that a young boy sees ghosts, but the audience is not able to see any evidence of this. [...] "The most compelling footage seems to come more from the editing <b>room</b> <b>than</b> beyond the grave", noted one industry trade publication. Reviewers say the show also fails to effectively integrate and utilize the team's (apparently) sophisticated audio and video equipment to heighten tension or help support their claims of paranormal activity.|$|E
2500|$|Naive {{interpretation}} of statistics derived from data sets that include outliers may be misleading. For example, {{if one is}} calculating the average temperature of 10 objects in a room, and nine of them are between 20 and 25 degrees Celsius, but an oven is at 175°C, the median of the data will be between 20 and 25°C but the mean temperature will be between 35.5 and 40°C. In this case, the median better reflects the temperature of a randomly sampled object (but not {{the temperature in the}} <b>room)</b> <b>than</b> the mean; naively interpreting the mean as [...] "a typical sample", equivalent to the median, is incorrect. As illustrated in this case, outliers may indicate data points that belong to a different population {{than the rest of the}} sample set.|$|E

A logical riddle must be solved to gain entry, whereas the Gryffindor and Slytherin common rooms only require a password (Hufflepuffs need to tap a barrel in the rhythm of [...] "Helga Hufflepuff"), indicating that it may be easier for those students from other houses who possess a high degree of intelligence to enter this common <b>room</b> <b>than</b> others.

The Impromptu Room faces north and is located next to the bar. [...] It is commonly used as the buffet dinner food area. The third room, Tu y Yo (English: You and I), and informally known as the Blue Room for the color on its walls, faces south and is used only for events consisting of more than 150 guests. The chamfered corner of the building has a smaller, more intimate <b>room</b> <b>than</b> the others, appropriately called The Chamfered Room.

2500|$|MacVicar {{designed}} the Blantyre Mission {{as a model}} of the British teaching hospital. [...] The hospital had two wards for African males and one ward for African women. [...] There were two beds for European patients. [...] There was more light in the hospital operating <b>room</b> <b>than</b> at other hospitals in the area. [...] This light served to improve the effectiveness of the doctors, but caused anxiety in the patients. [...] The African patients thought bad spirits could come through the windows. [...] It also contained a central heating system through an underground fire chamber. [...] MacVicar maintained detailed records of the treatments given at the hospital. [...] By 1905, the average hospital stay of patients at the Blantyre Mission was about half of what patients experienced at the UMCA hospital. [...] Moreover, MacVicar sought to have in-patient care so as to avoid forcing the patients to walk many miles to receive treatment each day.|$|E
2500|$|No kill shelters {{provide more}} <b>room</b> <b>than</b> other shelters.Although proponents of no-kill make the {{distinction}} between euthanasia and killing, some still assert that the term [...] "no-kill" [...] is unfair to employees of traditional shelters. The term has also caused a divide in the animal welfare community beyond ideology as it differentiates between no-kill and [...] "kill" [...] shelters, an accusation that cast a bad light on traditional shelters. Professor of Sociology and Anthropology Arnold Arluke has argued that [...] "The no-kill perspective has damaged the community that long existed among shelter workers, changing how they think and feel about each other. The vast majority of shelter workers suddenly are thought of as cruel; five million deaths each year are seen as avoidable rather than inevitable, as previously thought. The no-kill idea created culpability within the shelter world; open-admissionists became the guilty party."

2500|$|Stretched in all dimensions, the Premier {{provided}} more interior <b>room</b> <b>than</b> {{any of its}} contemporaries. The interior was an all-new design by AMC's in-house staff {{under the direction of}} Richard A. Teague. It also included features that were considered unique at the time. The instrument panel featured [...] "a heavy dose of electronics", with all driver controls housed within a fingertip distance from the steering wheel. It used an unusual dash mounted gear selector with a thin metal lever {{at the end of which}} was a grip handle; instead if the gear selector shifting downward in the traditional fashion, the lever dropped into the dash pod in which it was mounted. The climate controls used an unusual up-down button that cycled through the different heating modes, indicated by an array of lights. All of these controls were housed in a control panel on the right side of the steering column. On the left side of the column another control contained the light and windshield wiper controls. The turn signal control was also electronic returning to its centered position immediately after a driver signaled a turn, and a gong indicated its cancellation after completing a turn. The optional cruise control was built into the leather-wrapped steering wheel. Other features included intermittent wipers, as well as automatic variable-speed that adjusted wiper speed to the amount of water that hit the windshield; with less moisture, the slower they would move, but increasing their action if a passing truck splashed the windshield with a large amount of water. Standard on all Premiers was an electronically tuned stereo sound system.|$|E
2500|$|The University of Chicago {{developed}} the major sociologists at the time. It brought them together, and even {{gave them a}} hub and a network to link all the leading sociologists. In 1925, {{a third of all}} sociology graduate students attended the University of Chicago. Chicago was very good at not isolating their students from other schools. They encouraged them to blend with other sociologists, and to not spend more time in the class <b>room</b> <b>than</b> studying the society around them. [...] This would teach them real life application of the classroom teachings. The first teachings at the University of Chicago were focused on the social problems that the world had been dealt. At this time, academia was not concerned with theory; especially not to the point that academia is today. Many people were still hesitant of sociology at this time, especially with the recent controversial theories of Weber and Marx. The University of Chicago decided to go into an entirely different direction and their sociology department directed their attention to the individual and promoted equal rights. Their concentration was small groups and discoveries of the individual’s relationship to society. The program combined with other departments to offer students well-rounded studies requiring courses in hegemony, economics, psychology, multiple social sciences and political science. Albion Small {{was the head of the}} sociology program at the University of Chicago. He played a key role in bringing German sociological advancements directly into American academic sociology. Small also created the American Journal of Sociology. [...] Robert Park and Ernest Burgess refined the program’s methods, guidelines, and checkpoints. This made the findings more standardized, concise and easier to comprehend. The pair even wrote the sociology program’s textbook for a reference and get all students on the same page more effectively. Many remarkable sociologists such as George Hebert Mead, W.E. Du Bois, Robert Park, Charles S. Johnson, William Ogburn, Hebert Blumer and many others have significant ties to the University of Chicago.|$|E
