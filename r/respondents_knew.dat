40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of knee {{injuries}} and gonarthrosis. The thesis has theoretical and empirical character. The theoretical section is divided into three main chapters. The anatomy of the knee joint is described in the first chapter. Second chapter deals with knee injuries; this part is focused on the injuries to ligaments, menisci, cartilage and patella. Gonarthrosis, its etiology, symptoms, treatment and prevention, is compiled in the last chapter. The empirical section contains the results of research. The research was performed as an anonymous questionnaire study. Respondents were older than 18 years and after the knee injury. The sample consisted of 102 respondents. The aim of the empirical section was to find out what kind of injuries the clients have experienced, their attitude towards the after-treatment of the injuries, their knowledge of gonarthrosis and whether they occupy themselves with its prevention. The results were processed into charts and graphs. The research show, that the most common injury is one to the anterior cruciate ligament. A third of the respondents does not follow the treatment regimen, most frequently they fail to walk on crutches or to wear a knee brace.

40|$|Available {{evidence}} suggests that changes in the funding of higher education have led to some students entering the sex industry {{in order to make}} ends meet. The current study comprises a sample of undergraduates (N= 130) in the south of England, who completed a cross-sectional survey of their financial circumstances, health, psychological well-being, substance use, and lifestyle. A response rate of 74 % was obtained. Data indicated that over 10 % of all <b>respondents</b> <b>knew</b> of students engaged in sex work (defined as prostitution, escorting, lap dancing or stripping) in order to support themselves financially. Poor psychological well-being, drinking problems and financial circumstances were associated with sex work, and although no direct evidence was found linking this to an earlier history of sexual abuse, there was an indirect relationship through the impact of abuse on mental health. A logistic regression model incorporating, GHQ scores, alcohol problems and hours worked outside of study strongly predicted whether <b>respondents</b> <b>knew</b> of students engaged in sex work. For lap dancing in particular the model was very strong. This study provides further evidence of students’ participation in sex work and its association with economic circumstances.

A retrospective survey was conducted using a self-administered postal questionnaire. Participants were physicians who staffed a SARS hotline during the SARS epidemic in Taipei, Taiwan from June 1 to 10, 2003. A response rate of 83 % was obtained. All <b>respondents</b> <b>knew</b> the causative agent of SARS, and knowledge regarding SARS features and preventive practices was good. However, only 54 % of <b>respondents</b> <b>knew</b> the incubation period of SARS. Hospital guidelines and news media were the major information sources.

Less than half of all respondents answered both scenarios correctly. The results obtained suggest that knowledge of SARS was generally good although obtained from both medical and non-medical sources. Specific knowledge was however lacking in certain areas and this affected the ability to appropriately triage callers. Standardized education and assessment of prior knowledge of SARS could improve the ability of physicians to triage callers in future outbreaks...|$|E

40|$|Analysis of {{a subset}} of data from a survey of 3696 relatives, friends and others who knew a sample of people dying in 1990 who lived in 20 areas of the United Kingdom (the Regional Study of Care for the Dying) is reported. Using the {{typology}} of awareness contexts developed by Glaser and Strauss [(1965) Awareness of Dying, Aldine, Chicago], the prevalence of different awareness contexts is described and compared with an earlier survey done in 1969. Open awareness of dying, where both the dying person and the <b>respondent</b> <b>knew</b> that the person was dying, is the most prevalent awareness context. This is particularly so in cancer and represents a change since 1969 when closed awareness (where the <b>respondent</b> <b>knows,</b> but the dying person does not) was more common. The characteristics of those dying in open and closed awareness contexts are then compared, suggesting that having cancer, not being mentally confused, having a <b>respondent</b> who <b>knew</b> {{for some time that}} the person was dying, and being of higher social class are independently predictive of full open awareness, a condition marked both by knowledge of dying, and a value commitment towards openness. Compared with people in closed awareness, people dying in full awareness are more able to plan their dying careers, so that they and their respondents are more satisfied with the degree of choice over the place of death, {{they are less likely to}} die alone, and are more likely to die in their own homes. Additionally, these individuals are more likely to have spoken of their wishes for euthanasia, another indicator of their desire to control the manner and timing of death. If dying from cancer, people in full open awareness are more likely to have received hospice care. It is suggested that underlying these patterns, and in contrast with some other cultures where awareness of dying is seen as less desirable, people dying in Anglophone countries are particularly concerned to maintain control over projects of self-identity. Their approach to death is a reflection of this individualism. death terminal care awareness hospice euthanasia...|$|R

40|$|Background: Listeriosis is a {{food-borne disease}} often {{associated}} with ready-to-eat foods. It usually causes mild febrile gastrointestinal illness in immunocompetent persons. In pregnant women, it may cause more severe infection and often crosses the placenta to infect the fetus, resulting in miscarriage, fetal death or neonatal morbidity. Simple precautions during pregnancy can prevent listeriosis. However, many women are unaware of these precautions and listeriosis education is often omitted from prenatal care. Methods: Volunteer pregnant women were recruited to complete a questionnaire to assess their knowledge of listeriosis and its prevention, in two separate studies. One study was {{a national survey of}} 403 women from throughout the USA, and the other survey was limited to 286 Minnesota residents. Results: In the multi-state survey, 74 of 403 respondents (18 %) had some knowledge of listeriosis, compared with 43 of 286 (15 %) respondents to the Minnesota survey.

Aim: To assess the knowledge of women`s issues in epilepsy among residents at the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. Method: Seventy two consenting residents from the Internal medicine, Family Medicine and Obstetrics & Gynecology departments of the hospital, were requested to complete the KOWIE II questionnaire designed to assess knowledge of women`s issues in epilepsy. Results: One fifth of the <b>respondents</b> <b>knew</b> {{about the effects of}} sex hormones on seizures. Two fifths knew of the higher incidence of sexual dysfunction among women with epilepsy, the undesirable effects of anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) on bone health, and the best choice of anti-epileptic drug in pregnancy.
