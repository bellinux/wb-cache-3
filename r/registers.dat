5|$|English has {{formal and}} {{informal}} speech <b>registers,</b> and informal <b>registers,</b> including child directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.|$|E
5|$|The machine's most {{significant}} innovation {{is generally considered}} to be its incorporation of index <b>registers,</b> commonplace on modern computers. The SSEM had included two <b>registers,</b> implemented as Williams tubes: the accumulator (A) and the program counter (C). As A and C had already been assigned, the tube holding the two index <b>registers,</b> originally known as B-lines, was given the name B. The contents of the <b>registers</b> could be used to modify program instructions, allowing convenient iteration through an array of numbers stored in memory. The Mark 1 also had a fourth tube, (M), to hold the multiplicand and multiplier for a multiplication operation.|$|E
5|$|Administration and {{religion}} were closely linked {{in the system}} of the Celestial Masters. Adherents were grouped by families, and each was attached to a district. Families and districts, and the gods all held copies of civil <b>registers.</b> The <b>registers</b> were detailed records of the people, and recorded each person's rank, identity and location. Any changes to those registered had to be accompanied by a monetary contribution known as a 'wage of faith.' Requests to the gods followed a bureaucratic model, and were drawn up according to specific administrative codes. The effectiveness of these requests depended upon the accuracy of the <b>registers</b> kept by the gods.|$|E
25|$|First-level nurses make up {{the bulk}} of the <b>registered</b> nurses in the UK. They were {{previously}} known by titles such as RGN (<b>registered</b> general nurse), RSCN (<b>registered</b> sick children's nurse), RMN (<b>registered</b> mental nurse) and RNMS (<b>registered</b> nurse (for the) mentally subnormal). The titles used now are similar, including RNA (<b>registered</b> nurse adult), RNC (<b>registered</b> nurse child), RNMH (<b>registered</b> nurse mental health) and RNLD (<b>registered</b> nurse learning disabilities).|$|R
5000|$|One unifying {{aspect of}} R2 <b>register</b> {{signalling}} variants {{is that all}} audio tones are combinations of two frequencies. Each pair of two frequencies is called a multi-frequency tone, or MF tone. Each call attempt has an origination end and a termination end, both to the multi-span call {{as well as for}} each span within that multi-span call routing. The origination end is called the outgoing <b>register</b> in R2 parlance. The termination end is called the incoming <b>register</b> in R2 parlance. The outgoing <b>register</b> transmits forward MF tones to the incoming <b>register.</b> The incoming <b>register</b> transmits backward MF tones to the outgoing <b>register.</b> The outgoing <b>register</b> detects backward MF tones arriving from the incoming <b>register.</b> The incoming <b>register</b> detects forward MF tones arriving from the outgoing <b>register.</b> The outgoing <b>register</b> transmits the first signal, but from that point forward the outgoing <b>register</b> merely passively responds to the prompting driven by each signal transmitted by the incoming <b>register.</b> (In apt modern-era proleptic terms, the outgoing <b>register's</b> first push signal to the incoming <b>register</b> is similar to a peer-to-peer message, whereas the incoming <b>register's</b> pull signals, which request information from the outgoing <b>register,</b> are client-server, where the client is the incoming <b>register</b> and the server is the outgoing <b>register.)</b> ...|$|R

5|$|In the {{administration}} of his diocese, Hugh introduced new methods of recording documents. This system was modelled on that which Hubert Walter had introduced into the chancery, with separate <b>registers</b> for each archdeaconry, and <b>registers,</b> or rolls, for charters and memoranda, much like the Charter Roll or Memoranda Roll of the royal chancery.

5|$|The Reverend John Vachell {{stayed on}} as vicar of St George's Littleport in title until 1830; he {{appointed}} a curate, George Britton Jermyn from 1817. Some of the St George's church <b>registers</b> were destroyed during the riots. The remaining <b>registers</b> start from 1754 (marriages), 1756 (burials), and 1783 (baptism). General unrest and riots {{such as that}} at Littleport {{may have been a}} factor in the government passing the Vagrancy Act of 1824. Due in part to some difficulties in enforcing the law and to continued public unease, the Metropolitan Police Act of 1829 was created leading to the first modern police force.|$|E
5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken <b>registers</b> of English, they are also used in written and formal <b>registers.</b>|$|E

5|$|Pronouns {{are subject}} to a {{complicated}} system of social register, the choice of pronoun depending on the perceived relationships between speaker, audience and referent (see Social <b>registers</b> below).
