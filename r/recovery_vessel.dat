25|$|After the German {{capture of}} Kristiansand Odin was {{handed over to}} the Kriegsmarine on 11 April and officially entered service as Panther on 20 April. However, before {{entering}} the Kriegsmarine she was partially rebuilt and rearmed. During the remainder of the war she operated in Skagerrak and Kattegat as an escort and training ship, in 1940 forming the 7. Torpedobootsflottille together with Gyller, and from January 1942 as a torpedo <b>recovery</b> <b>vessel</b> in Gotenhafen.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} of ordering the new multipurpose icebreaker {{was made in}} late 2004 and the Finnish Environment Institute and the Finnish Maritime Administration were authorized by the Government to make an agreement on the vessel and launch a request for tenders in early 2005. The new oil spill response vessel was expected to enter service in 2007. However, only a few offers were received and the new vessel, for which 134 million euro was reserved in the budget, {{turned out to be}} more expensive than expected. After evaluating more economic alternatives in October 2005 the committee working on the project came to a conclusion that a new multipurpose oil <b>recovery</b> <b>vessel</b> would still be the best solution to improve spill response readiness. 35 million euro were allocated for the purchasing of the new vessel.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{sensitive}} {{ecology of the}} Baltic Sea, it has been agreed in the Helsinki Convention (HELCOM) that instead of using dispersants to dissolve the oil slicks, combatting the spills is based on mechanical recovery using oil booms to limit the spill and skimmers to collect the oil from the surface as quickly and completely as possible. For this purpose every Finnish pollution control vessel is equipped with permanently installed built-in recovery equipment and such systems have also been installed on several patrol vessels of the Finnish Border Guard. As the primary mission of the new vessel is pollution prevention, the ship has an extensive array of equipment capable of detecting and recovering spilled oil and chemicals in open water, high seas and ice conditions. Some of the equipment, such as an oil-detecting radar and a thermographic camera in the mast, are used {{for the first time}} in a Finnish oil <b>recovery</b> <b>vessel.</b> In addition the ship has a weather station and a wet laboratory capable of analyzing water samples automatically.|$|E

500|$|In September 2000, a joint {{expedition}} {{to find the}} sunken battleship conducted by the BBC, NRK, and the Royal Norwegian Navy began. The underwater survey vessel Sverdrup II, operated by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, was used to scan the sea floor. After locating a large submerged object, the research team then used the Royal Norwegian Navy's underwater <b>recovery</b> <b>vessel</b> [...] to examine the object visually. The wreck was positively identified by an ROV on 10 September, which located armament consistent with that of Scharnhorst. The ship sank in approximately [...] of water. The hull lies upside down on the seabed, with debris, including the main mast and rangefinders, scattered around the wreck. Extensive damage from shellfire and torpedoes is evident; the bow was blown off, presumably from a magazine explosion in the forward turrets, and lies in a tangled mass of steel {{some distance from the}} rest of the hull.|$|E

40|$|A {{continuous}} {{process for the}} extraction of sunflower oil using supercritical CO 2, featuring multiple extractors, one oil separator and three cascaded CO 2 <b>recovery</b> <b>vessels</b> operating at different pressures, was devised and studied. For every single equipment of the plant making up the process a mathematical model was built. Experimental tests-consisting in measurements of oil solubility in supercritical CO 2 -were carried out in a laboratory-scale apparatus to characterise the behaviour of sunflower oil in the separation from the supercritical fluid. The mathematical model of the whole process was coded in the commercial gPROMS process modelling environment where both its simulation and optimisation-this latter assuming the overall oil production cost as the objective function were carried out. The process- and economics-related results are discussed and compared with those obtained with traditional and cold-pressing extraction. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
