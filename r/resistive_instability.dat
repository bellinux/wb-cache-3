50|$|Resistive instabilities are {{an issue}} for all {{magnetic}} configurations, since the onset can occur at beta values well below the ideal limit. The stability of neoclassical tearing modes (NTM) is a key issue for magnetic configurations with a strong bootstrap current. The NTM is a metastable mode; in certain plasma configurations, a sufficiently large deformation of the bootstrap current produced by a “seed island” {{can contribute to the}} growth of the island. The NTM is already an important performance-limiting factor in many tokamak experiments, leading to degraded confinement or disruption. Although the basic mechanism is well established, the capability to predict the onset in present and future devices requires better understanding of the damping mechanisms which determine the threshold island size, and of the mode coupling by which other instabilities (such as sawteeth in tokamaks) can generate seed islands. Resistive Ballooning Mode, similar to ideal ballooning, but with finite resistivity taken into consideration, provides another example of a <b>resistive</b> <b>instability.</b>|$|E

40|$|Possible {{effects of}} {{magnetic}} fields in core collapse supernovae rely on an efficient amplification {{of the weak}} pre-collapse fields. It {{has been suggested that}} the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) leads to rapid field growth. Although MRI studies exist for accretion discs, the application of their results to core collapse supernovae is inhibited as the physics of supernova cores is substantially different from that of accretion discs. We address the problem of growth and saturation of the MRI by means of semi-global simulations, which combine elements of global and local simulations by taking the presence of global background gradients into account and using a local computational grid. We analyze the dispersion relation of the MRI to identify different regimes of the instability. This analysis is complemented by simulations, where we consider a local computational box rotating at sub-Keplerian velocity, and where we allow for a radial entropy gradient. We identify six regimes of the MRI depending on the ratio of the entropy and angular velocity gradient. Our numerical models confirm the instability criteria and growth rates for all relevant regimes. The MRI grows exponentially within milliseconds the flow and magnetic field geometries being dominated by channel flows. The MRI growth ceases once the channels are disrupted by <b>resistive</b> <b>instabilities</b> (due to finite numerical conductivity), and MHD turbulence sets in. From an analysis of the growth rates of the <b>resistive</b> <b>instabilities,</b> we deduce scaling laws for the termination amplitude of the MRI which agree well with our numerical models.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} {{in the past that}} single, 2 D coronal arcades are very unlikely driven unstable by a simple shear of the photospheric footpoints of the magnetic field lines.

The photospheric footpoint velocity in this model is nonsingular and the shear dominates everywhere. Starting from a planar potential field geometry for the arcade, it is found that after some time a current sheet is formed which is unstable with respect to the tearing instability. The time of its onset scales with the logarithm of the magnetic diffusivity assumed in the calculation. In its nonlinear phase, a quasi-stationary situation arises {{in the vicinity of the}} x-line with an almost constant reconnection rate.

40|$|The {{view point}} that the spiral arms could be in quasi-steady state is {{suggested}} from the considerations of instability. The dissipation of the magnetic field in the arms by instability is supposed to compensate {{the increase in the}} field due to the wrapping of the magnetic lines of force resulting from the differential rotation in the Galactic disk.

Taking into account the compressibility of fluid, the spiral arms are shown to be unstable for the interchange model of gravitational instability against a suitable length of deformation.

40|$|The solar coronal activities, such as solar flares, are {{believed}} to arise {{as a result of}} photospheric plasma motion, which supplies magnetic free energy as well as magnetic helicity into the solar corona. In this paper, we investigated the physical relationship between magnetic helicity and the coronal activity, based on the three-dimensional numerical simulations and on the vector magnetograph observations. We found that magnetic helicity flow across the solar surface has a patchy structure, in which the right-handed helicity and the left-handed helicity were almost simultaneously injected within an active region. Furthermore, it was also revealed, in the various flare events, that the initial brightening of TRACE 1, 600 Å image was located at a region where magnetic shear is sharply reversed on the photosphere. Motivated by these observations, we carried out the numerical simulations, in which the magnetic shear in a magnetic arcade is reversed by a slow foot-point motion. It was demonstrated by the simulations that the <b>resistive</b> <b>instability</b> growing on the shear inversion layer can lead to the eruption of large-scale plasmoid through the interaction of two different kinds of magnetic reconnections.

To isolate the eruption physics, our study uses the breakout model, which is insensitive to the energy buildup process leading to the eruption. We performed 2. 5 D simulations with adaptive mesh refinement that achieved the highest overall spatial resolution to date in a CME/eruptive flare simulation. The ultra-high resolution allows us to separate clearly {{the timing of the}} various phases of the eruption. Using new computational tools, we have determined the number and evolution of all X- and O-type nulls in the system, thereby tracking both the progress and the products of reconnection throughout the computational domain. Our results show definitively that CME onset is due to the start of fast reconnection at the breakout current sheet. Once this reconnection begins, eruption is inevitable; if this is the only reconnection in the system, however, the eruption will be slow. The explosive CME acceleration is triggered by fast reconnection at the flare current sheet. Our results indicate that the explosive eruption is caused by a <b>resistive</b> <b>instability,</b> not an ideal process. Moreover, both breakout and flare reconnections begin first as a form of weak tearing characterized by a slowly evolving plasmoids, but eventually transition to a fast form with well-defined Alfvenic reconnection jets and rapid flux transfer.

This is the classic condition for the <b>resistive</b> wall <b>instability</b> and the effect of a plasma flow velocity on this mode is explored. It is noted that a stable kink mode, Doppler shifted by the flow velocity, can pass through zero frequency for a velocity which depends on the marginal condition for the external kink instability. The passage through zero frequency is the condition for the kink mode to carry negative energy. It is shown how this mode implies a critical flow speed at which the resistive wall mode is further destabilized, with a growth rate inversely proportional to the square root of the wall time. Under these circumstances, the resistive wall mode behaves more like an ideal instability.
