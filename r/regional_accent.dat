25|$|The Cornish {{language}} and culture influenced the emergence of particular pronunciations and grammar not used elsewhere in England. The Cornish dialect is spoken to varying degrees, however someone speaking full Anglo-Cornish may be practically unintelligible to one not accustomed it. Cornish dialect has generally declined, in most places it is now {{little more than a}} <b>regional</b> <b>accent</b> and grammatical differences have been eroded over time.|$|E
50|$|One {{aspect of}} the {{differences}} between American and British English is that of pronunciation, as described in American and British English pronunciation differences. The General American (GA) and the British Received Pronunciation (RP) accents have some significant points of difference, described in this article. However, other <b>regional</b> <b>accents</b> in each country also show differences, for which see <b>regional</b> <b>accents</b> of English speakers.|$|R

25|$|One factor fueling General American's {{popularity}} was {{the major}} demographic change of twentieth-century American society: increased suburbanization, leading to less mingling of different social classes and less density and diversity of linguistic interactions. As a result, wealthier and higher-educated Americans' communications became more restricted to their own demographic, which, alongside their new marketplace that transcended regional boundaries (arising from the century's faster transportation methods), reinforced a widespread belief that highly educated Americans should not possess a <b>regional</b> <b>accent.</b> A General American sound is then the result of both suburbanization and suppression of <b>regional</b> <b>accent</b> by highly educated Americans in formal settings. A second factor was a rise in immigration to the Great Lakes area (one native region of General American speech) following the region's rapid industrialization after the American Civil War, when this region's speakers went on to form a successful and highly mobile business elite, who travelled {{around the country in}} the mid-twentieth century, spreading the high status of their accent system. A third possible factor is that various sociological (often race- and class-based) forces unconsciously repelled socially-conscious Americans away from pronunciations associated with African Americans and poor white communities in the South and with Southern and Eastern European immigrant communities (for example, American Jews) in the coastal Northeast, instead settling upon or favoring pronunciations more prestigiously associated with White Anglo-Saxon Protestant culture in the remainder of the country: namely, the West, Midwest, and western New England.|$|E
25|$|The {{speaking}} dialect or accent of {{a person}} may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that {{is used in the}} style of music they are singing in, rather than a <b>regional</b> <b>accent</b> or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent {{of a person}} than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.|$|E
25|$|Vocal {{imitation}} occurs potentially {{in regard}} to a diverse range of phonetic units and types of vocalization. The world's languages use consonantal phones that differ in thirteen imitable vocal tract place of articulations (from the lips to the glottis). These phones can potentially be pronounced with eleven types of imitable manner of articulations (nasal stops to lateral clicks). Speech can be copied {{in regard to}} its social accent, intonation, pitch and individuality (as with entertainment impersonators). Speech can be articulated in ways which diverge considerably in speed, timbre, pitch, loudness and emotion. Speech further exists in different forms such as song, verse, scream and whisper. Intelligible speech can be produced with pragmatic intonation and in regional dialects and foreign accents. These aspects are readily copied: people asked to repeat speech-like words imitate not only phones but also accurately other pronunciation aspects such as fundamental frequency, schwa-syllable expression, voice spectra and lip kinematics, voice onset times, and <b>regional</b> <b>accent.</b>|$|E

500|$|Brocklebank {{was hired}} by Emmerdale to play Ivan for a three episode stint.

Brocklebank told Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury that the serial's producers did not intend for his character to develop, but they enjoyed his work and kept him on. They later extended his contract to last into mid-2006. Brocklebank found that taking the role gave him a [...] "new respect" [...] for soap opera actors because of how hard he had to work. While the actor is from Warwickshire; Ivan is a Geordie and has the <b>regional</b> <b>accent.</b> Brocklebank had to put the accent on for the role and members of the public were confused when they heard him speak in person.|$|E

During this time, Watts attended a Welsh language school, Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni. She later said of her time in Wales: [...] "We took Welsh lessons in a school {{in the middle of nowhere}} while everyone else was taking English. Wherever we moved, I would adapt and pick up the <b>regional</b> <b>accent.</b> It's obviously significant now, me being an actress. Anyway, there was quite a lot of sadness in my childhood, but no lack of love." [...] In 1978, her mother remarried (though she would later be divorced again) and Watts and her brother then moved to Suffolk, where she attended Thomas Mills High School. Watts has stated that she wanted to become an actress after seeing her mother performing on stage and from the time she watched the 1980 film Fame.|$|E

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} to {{support the notion that}} US <b>regional</b> <b>accents</b> influence decisions in the hiring process. Fifty-six people who hire for a variety of corporations participated in a computerized survey, during which they listened to speakers from regions of the US reading the same passage. Respondents judged the speakers on personal characteristics commonly considered in hiring decisions, attempted to identify the speakers' regions, and selected job categories for each speaker, in addition to providing information about their own linguistic security. Results indicate: 1) judgments based on <b>regional</b> <b>accents</b> strongly correlate to selection of job categories, 2) respondents were not able to identify <b>regional</b> <b>accents</b> correctly, and 3) negative judgments were assigned to the speakers of accents that were correctly identified...|$|R

40|$|The visual {{dimension}} has featured {{prominently in}} person perception {{in the last}} 25 years. Alone, this dimension cannot give the complete 'picture' of others because language and speech (i. e., the auditory dimension) are also highly informative. Social-cognition research investigates the role of auditory information for impression formation. In a series of experiments, we tested perceived competence, hirability, and socio-intellectual status of different targets based on their <b>regional</b> <b>accents.</b> Given identical content of statements in different conditions of an alleged job interview, <b>regional</b> German <b>accents</b> (Saxon, Bavarian, and Berlin) resulted in lower perceived competence and hirability than standard German, even though the Bavarian accent {{at the same time}} resulted in higher ratings of socio-intellectual status compared to other <b>regional</b> <b>accents</b> (Experiment 1). These findings were confirmed when using a broader population sample and a 'matched guise' technique (Experiment 2). Our findings indicate that <b>regional</b> <b>accents,</b> similar to faces, can be very powerful in creating differentiated pictures of individuals...|$|R

40|$|<b>Regional</b> <b>accents</b> {{recognition}} {{is one of}} the most important research topics in speech processing. However, the development of such systems is time-consuming and an expensive process since it requires collecting and processing a large amount of training and evaluation data for each target accent. This work presents some preliminary results about the Algerian <b>regional</b> <b>accents</b> recognition using the i-vectors approach. The experiments have been carried out using a dataset collected from the east and the center of Algeria. The obtained results show the benefits of using the i-vectors approach to recognize both <b>regional</b> <b>accents</b> and to assess the impact of evaluation data quality on the accuracy of the proposed recognition method. However, it has been noted that the confusion rates obtained between both accents may be related to the evaluation data quality, the linguistic similarity existing between both accents and some languages contact phenomenon such as the code switching...|$|R
2500|$|A {{regional}} Southern American English consolidated {{and expanded}} throughout all the traditional Southern States {{since the last}} quarter of the nineteenth century until around World War II, largely superseding the older Southern American English dialects.
