5|$|Treatment {{involves}} reassuring {{the patient}} that the often frightening symptoms will pass, <b>rehydration</b> (fluid replacement) for fluid loss from vomiting, and monitoring for cardiac arrhythmias.|$|E
5|$|The {{amount of}} fluid {{replaced}} {{depends on the}} estimated degree of dehydration. If dehydration is so severe as to cause shock (severely decreased blood pressure with insufficient blood supply to the body's organs), or a depressed level of consciousness, rapid infusion of saline (1 liter for adults, 10 ml/kg in repeated doses for children) is recommended to restore circulating volume. Slower <b>rehydration</b> based on calculated water and sodium shortage may be possible if the dehydration is moderate, and again saline is the recommended fluid. Very mild ketoacidosis with no associated vomiting and mild dehydration may be treated with oral <b>rehydration</b> and subcutaneous rather than intravenous insulin under observation for signs of deterioration.|$|E
5|$|Gastroenteritis {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral <b>rehydration</b> therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of gastroenteritis in {{both children and}} adults is <b>rehydration.</b> This is preferably achieved by drinking <b>rehydration</b> solution, although intravenous delivery may be required {{if there is a}} decreased level of consciousness or if dehydration is severe. Drinking replacement therapy products made with complex carbohydrates (i.e. those made from wheat or rice) may be superior to those based on simple sugars. Drinks especially high in simple sugars, such as soft drinks and fruit juices, are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase diarrhea. Plain water may be used if more specific ORT preparations are unavailable or the person is not willing to drink them. A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted. In those who require intravenous fluids, one to four hours' worth is often sufficient.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, {{gastroenteritis}} {{from all}} causes caused 4.6 million deaths in children, {{with the majority}} occurring in the developing world. Death rates were reduced significantly (to approximately 1.5 million deaths annually) by the year 2000, {{largely due to the}} introduction and widespread use of oral <b>rehydration</b> therapy. In the US, infections causing gastroenteritis are the second most common infection (after the common cold), and they result in between 200 and 375million cases of acute diarrhea and approximately ten thousand deaths annually, with 150 to 300 of these deaths in children less than five years of age.|$|E
5|$|Prevention {{includes}} {{hand washing}} with soap, drinking clean water, proper disposal of human waste, and breastfeeding babies {{instead of using}} formula. The rotavirus vaccine is recommended in children. Treatment involves getting enough fluids. For mild or moderate cases, this can typically be achieved by drinking oral <b>rehydration</b> solution (a combination of water, salts, and sugar). In those who are breast fed, continued breastfeeding is recommended. For more severe cases, intravenous fluids may be needed. Fluids may also be given by a nasogastric tube. Zinc supplementation is recommended in children. Antibiotics are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{chloride}} anion is {{an essential}} nutrient for metabolism. Chlorine is needed {{for the production of}} hydrochloric acid in the stomach and in cellular pump functions. The main dietary source is table salt, or sodium chloride. Overly low or high concentrations of chloride in the blood are examples of electrolyte disturbances. Hypochloremia (having too little chloride) rarely occurs in the absence of other abnormalities. Its sometimes associated with hypoventilation. It can be associated with chronic respiratory acidosis. Hyperchloremia (having too much chloride) usually does not produce symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they tend to resemble those of hypernatremia (having too much sodium). Reduction in blood chloride leads to cerebral dehydration; symptoms are most often caused by rapid <b>rehydration</b> which results in cerebral edema. Hyperchloremia can affect oxygen transport.|$|E
5|$|Venezuela's then-president Ramón José Velásquez held an {{emergency}} meeting {{to respond to}} the Bret's heavy damage. The president conveyed three days of national mourning due to the storm. About 1,400workers and volunteers helped in rescue efforts after the mudslides struck Caracas and surrounding areas, assisted by Red Cross volunteers and 800firefighters. Volunteers provided water and medicine to the affected, while workers emptied residual pools of water to mitigate the spread of disease. Storm victims were temporarily housed at the Fuerte Tiuna army base. Roads were quickly cleared of debris and mud, although many were not reopened initially due to the threat for additional mudslides. Within a week of the storm's passage, telephone service was largely repaired in Caracas and airline travel was restored. After the storm, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) provided US$50,000 in emergency spending, and UNICEF sent US$15,000 to buy oral <b>rehydration</b> salts. A Venezuelan radio station held a marathon to collect relief items, such as food or clothing.|$|E
5|$|Although Woodfull was {{a devout}} Methodist, {{he would show}} a deep concern in the {{personal}} welfare of all players, which extended to finding {{the location of the}} nearest Catholic Church for those teammates who followed the religion. At the time, Australian society at large was divided along Catholic-Protestant lines, and while O'Reilly and McCabe were full of praise for Woodfull, they were later accused of leading a Catholic revolt against the leadership of the Protestant Bradman during a divisive period in the late-1930s. While Woodfull himself never touched alcohol due to his strict adherence to his religious principles, he did not impose his beliefs on his team. He would buy drinks for his players, and ask administrators to provide more alcohol for his teammates when they were exhausted. At the time, cricketers widely regarded beer as a highly effective means of <b>rehydration,</b> and on one occasion Woodfull threatened to halt play when administrators refused his players more ale {{on the grounds that they}} had already consumed their quota.|$|E
5|$|There is no antidote, and {{supportive}} care is {{the mainstay of}} further treatment for intoxication. Though {{sometimes referred to as}} a deliriant and while muscarine was first isolated from A. muscaria and as such is its namesake, muscimol does not have action, either as an agonist or antagonist, at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor site, and therefore atropine or physostigmine as an antidote is not recommended. If a patient is delirious or agitated, this can usually be treated by reassurance and, if necessary, physical restraints. A benzodiazepine such as diazepam or lorazepam can be used to control combativeness, agitation, muscular overactivity, and seizures. Only small doses should be used, as they may worsen the respiratory depressant effects of muscimol. Recurrent vomiting is rare, but if present may lead to fluid and electrolyte imbalances; intravenous <b>rehydration</b> or electrolyte replacement may be required. Serious cases may develop loss of consciousness or coma, and may need intubation and artificial ventilation. Hemodialysis can remove the toxins, although this intervention is generally considered unnecessary. With modern medical treatment the prognosis is typically good following supportive treatment.|$|E
25|$|For babies a dropper or syringe {{without the}} needle {{can be used}} to put small amounts of fluid into the mouth; for {{children}} under 2, a teaspoon every one to two minutes; and for older children and adults, frequent sips directly from a cup. After the first two hours, <b>rehydration</b> should be continued at the same or slower rate, determined by how much fluid the child wants and any ongoing diarrheal loses. After the first two hours of <b>rehydration</b> it is recommended that to alternate between <b>rehydration</b> and food.|$|E
25|$|For {{patients}} with dehydration, oral fluid <b>rehydration</b> is needed.|$|E
25|$|Treatment is {{primarily}} supportive in nature. Early supportive care with <b>rehydration</b> and symptomatic treatment improves survival. <b>Rehydration</b> may be via the oral or by intravenous route. These measures may include management of pain, nausea, fever and anxiety. The World Health Organization recommends avoiding {{the use of}} aspirin or ibuprofen for pain due to the bleeding risk associated with use of these medications.|$|E
25|$|Dehydration, {{sometimes}} due to diarrhoea or cholera, {{may also}} be present in a population, and MSF set up <b>rehydration</b> centres to combat this. A special solution called Oral <b>Rehydration</b> Solution (ORS), which contains glucose and electrolytes, is given to patients to replace fluids lost. Antibiotics are also sometimes given to individuals with diarrhoea if {{it is known that}} they have cholera or dysentery.|$|E
25|$|Appropriate {{amounts of}} {{supplemental}} zinc and potassium {{should be added}} if available. But the availability of these should not delay <b>rehydration.</b> As WHO points out, {{the most important thing}} is to begin preventing dehydration as early as possible. In another example of prompt ORS hopefully preventing dehydration, CDC recommends for the treatment of cholera continuing to give Oral <b>Rehydration</b> Solution during travel to medical treatment.|$|E
25|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{recommends}} rehydrating {{a severely}} undernourished {{child who has}} diarrhea relatively slowly. The preferred method is with fluids by mouth using a drink called oral <b>rehydration</b> solution (ORS). The oral <b>rehydration</b> solution is both slightly sweet and slightly salty and the one recommended in those with severe undernutrition should have half the usual sodium and greater potassium. Fluids by nasogastric tube may be use in {{those who do not}} drink. Intravenous fluids are recommended only in those who have significant dehydration due to their potential complications. These complications include congestive heart failure. Over time, ORS developed into ORT, or oral <b>rehydration</b> therapy, which focused on increasing fluids by supplying salts, carbohydrates, and water. This switch from type of fluid to amount of fluid was crucial in order to prevent dehydration from diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Carrying C. difficile without {{symptoms}} is common. Treatment {{in those}} without symptoms is controversial. In general, mild cases {{do not require}} specific treatment. Oral <b>rehydration</b> therapy is useful in treating dehydration associated with the diarrhea.|$|E
25|$|Rice {{containing}} these added proteins {{can be used}} as {{a component}} in oral <b>rehydration</b> solutions which are used to treat diarrheal diseases, thereby shortening their duration and reducing recurrence. Such supplements may also help reverse anemia.|$|E
25|$|To prevent {{dehydration}} {{readily available}} fluids, preferably {{with a modest}} amount of sugars and salt such as vegetable broth or salted rice water, may be used. The drinking of additional clean water is also recommended. Once dehydration develops oral <b>rehydration</b> solutions are preferred. As much of these drinks as the person wants can be given, unless {{there are signs of}} swelling. If vomiting occurs, fluids can be paused for 5–10 minutes and then restarting more slowly. Vomiting rarely prevents <b>rehydration</b> as fluid are still absorbed and the vomiting rarely last long. A severely malnourished child with what appears to be dehydration but who has not had diarrhea should be treated as if they have an infection.|$|E
25|$|Immediate {{efforts in}} 2010 by the CDC to make {{treatment}} more accessible included {{increasing the number}} of treatment centers and <b>rehydration</b> points. As a result of these efforts the mortality rate decreased from 4% of all cases to less than 1%.|$|E
25|$|Two {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that Gatorade is at least as effective in treating dehydration as oral <b>rehydration</b> salts for adults or Pedialyte for {{children between the ages of}} 5 and 12. In both studies, however, potassium deficiency (hypokalemia) was more common in patients receiving Gatorade.|$|E
25|$|If commercially {{produced}} oral <b>rehydration</b> {{solutions are}} too expensive or difficult to obtain, solutions can be made. One such recipe calls for 1 liter of boiled water, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 6 teaspoons of sugar, and added mashed banana for potassium {{and to improve}} taste.|$|E
25|$|Robert Allan Phillips, {{working at}} the US Naval Medical Research Unit Two in Southeast Asia, {{evaluated}} the pathophysiology of the disease using modern laboratory chemistry techniques and developed a protocol for <b>rehydration.</b> His research led the Lasker Foundation to award him its prize in 1967.|$|E
25|$|A {{symptomatic}} treatment includes <b>rehydration</b> and pain relief with {{drugs such as}} paracetamol (acetaminophen in the United States). Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) should not be given because of its anticoagulant effect, which can be devastating {{in the case of}} internal bleeding that can occur with yellow fever.|$|E
25|$|Re-lactation is {{the process}} of {{restarting}} breastfeeding. In developing countries, mothers may restart breastfeeding after a weaning as part of an oral <b>rehydration</b> treatment for diarrhea. In developed countries, re-lactation is common after early medical problems are resolved, or because a mother changes her mind about breastfeeding.|$|E
25|$|In {{those with}} diarrhea, once an initial four-hour <b>rehydration</b> period is completed, zinc supplementation is recommended. Daily zinc {{increases}} {{the chances of}} reducing the severity and duration of the diarrhea, and continuing with daily zinc for ten to fourteen days makes diarrhea less likely recur {{in the next two}} to three months.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to fluids given to achieve adequate <b>rehydration,</b> {{each time the}} puppy vomits or has diarrhea in a significant quantity, {{an equal amount of}} fluid is administered intravenously. The fluid requirements of a patient are determined by the animal's body weight, weight changes over time, degree of dehydration at presentation and surface area.|$|E
25|$|A {{simple method}} {{requiring}} no specialized equipment is to snort water from cupped hands, but this clears {{little more than}} the nostrils. The application of commercially available saline nasal spray is another simple alternative, but it is relatively inefficient for washing away debris, although it may suffice for simple <b>rehydration</b> of mucous and tissues.|$|E
25|$|Vomiting often {{occurs during}} the first hour or two of {{treatment}} with ORS, especially if a child drinks the solution too quickly, but this seldom prevents successful <b>rehydration</b> {{since most of the}} fluid is still absorbed. WHO recommends that if a child vomits, to wait five or ten minutes and then start to give the solution again more slowly.|$|E
25|$|Acute {{pancreatitis}} or acute pancreatic necrosis is {{a sudden}} {{inflammation of the}} pancreas. It can have severe complications and high mortality despite treatment. While mild cases are often successfully treated with conservative measures, such as fasting and aggressive intravenous fluid <b>rehydration,</b> severe cases may require admission to {{the intensive care unit}} or even surgery to deal with complications of the disease process.|$|E
25|$|In Bangladesh zinc supplementation {{reduced the}} {{duration}} {{and severity of}} diarrhea in children with cholera when given with antibiotics and <b>rehydration</b> therapy as needed. It reduced the length of disease by eight hours {{and the amount of}} diarrhea stool by 10%. Supplementation appears to be also effective in both treating and preventing infectious diarrhea due to other causes among children in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|In warmer regions, where overripening is a concern, the {{opposite}} process of <b>rehydration</b> and acidification is used. This {{is used in}} jurisdictions such as areas of California, where if the must has excess sugar for normal fermentation, water may be added to lower the concentration. In acidification, tartaric acid {{is added to the}} must to compensate for the high levels of sugar and low levels of acid naturally found in ripe grapes.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol has a {{dehydrating}} {{effect by}} causing increased urine production (diuresis), which could cause thirst, dry mouth, dizziness and {{may lead to}} an electrolyte imbalance. Studies suggest that electrolyte changes play only a minor role in {{the genesis of the}} alcohol hangover and are caused by dehydration effects. Drinking water may help relieve symptoms as a result of dehydration but it is unlikely that <b>rehydration</b> significantly reduces the presence and severity of alcohol hangover.|$|E
25|$|The {{measles vaccine}} is {{effective}} at preventing the disease. Vaccination {{has resulted in}} a 75% decrease in deaths from measles between 2000 and 2013 with about 85% of children globally being currently vaccinated. No specific treatment is available. Supportive care may improve outcomes. This may include giving oral <b>rehydration</b> solution (slightly sweet and salty fluids), healthy food, and medications to control the fever. Antibiotics may be used if a secondary bacterial infection such as pneumonia occurs. Vitamin A supplementation is also recommended in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|Flewett's work on rotaviruses {{brought him}} {{international}} recognition {{both as a}} virologist and an electron microscopist. He {{was one of the}} first western virologists to be invited to the Peoples' Republic of China (in 1983) to lecture. He was a judge for the King Faisal International Prize in 1983, which was awarded to Professor John S. Fordtran, Dr William B. Greenough III and Professor Michael Field, for their work on oral <b>rehydration</b> therapy in reducing mortality and morbidity due to cholera and other acute infectious diarrhoeal diseases.|$|E
25|$|Inadequate medical supplies, {{water and}} {{environmental}} contamination, frequent power failures, and outdated training {{led to a}} health care crisis that added to the overall devastation. According to a 1997 UNICEF delegation, hospitals were clean but wards were devoid {{of even the most}} rudimentary supplies and equipment; sphygmomanometers, thermometers, scales, kidney dishes, spatulas, IV giving sets, etc. The mission saw numerous patients being treated with home made beer bottle IV sets, clearly unsterile. There was an absence of ORS (oral <b>rehydration</b> solution) and even the most basic drugs such as analgesics and antibiotics.|$|E
