The phytoseiid mite Euseius citrifolius Dennmark & Muma has frequently been recorded on rubber tree crops. The objective of this work {{was to determine the}} predatory activity of E. citrifolius on the different life stages (egg, larva, nymph and adult) of T. heveae. The experiments were carried out in Petri dishes (9 -cm diameter) containing a layer of wet cotton inside, onto which a disk of rubber tree leaf (2. 5 -cm diameter) was laid. The disks were taken from naturally infested leaves. Twenty specimens in the life stage that was to be tested were left on the disk and the others were eliminated; a predator life stage (larva, nymph or female) was obtained from a laboratory stock colony and put into each dish. For each tested life stage of E. citrifolius, 4 treatments (T. heveae life stages) and 20 replications were considered in a randomized block design. The observations were made after 24 hours for larvae and nymphs of the predator, and after 24, 48 and 72 hours for the females. E. citrifolius larvae and nymphs had a higher preference for T. heveae larvae followed by nymphs, eggs and adults. Within 72 hours, each predator female consumed 15. 0 larvae, 14. 5 nymphs, 7. 4 adults or 2. 2 eggs of T. heveae.

40|$|Plants {{constitute}} an ample source of nutrients for {{a diversity of}} organisms that include viruses, microbes, nematodes, insects, and mites. To protect their resources, plants possess a robust immune system that establishes structural and biochemical defenses to fight invaders. Some of these defenses are highly effective but often are very costly to sustain. Thus plants have developed inducible defenses, i. e. they are only produced when needed, regulated by a highly interconnected network in which hormones and protein hubs play important roles. However, plant diseases and pest outbreaks still occur. Many successful plant parasites manipulate the regulation of their host inducible defenses, and often they do so by employing specialized secreted proteins that sabotage the plant immunity network. In phytopathology these proteins are known as effectors. In this thesis I have discovered an arsenal of effector proteins in <b>spider</b> <b>mites,</b> particularly in the saliva of two spotted <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> (Tetranychus urticae) and the <b>red</b> tomato <b>spider</b> <b>mite</b> (T. evansi), {{both of which are}} problematic pests in agriculture.

40|$|We propose {{an optimal}} control {{framework}} to describe intra-seasonal predator-prey interactions, which {{are characterized by}} a continuous-time dynamical model comprising predator and prey density, {{as well as the}} energy budget of the prey over the length of a season. The model includes a time-dependent decision variable for the prey, representing the portion of the prey population in time that is active, as opposed to diapausing (a state of physiological rest). The predator follows autonomous dynamics and accordingly it remains active during the season. The proposed model is a generalization of the classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model towards non-autonomous dynamics that furthermore includes the effect of an energy variable. The model has been inspired by a specific biological system of predatory mites (Acari: Phytoseiidae) and prey <b>mites</b> (so-called fruit-tree <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> <b>mites)</b> (Acari: Tetranychidae) that feed on leaves of apple trees—its parameters have been instantiated based on laboratory and field studies. The goal of the work is to understand the decisions of the prey mites to enter diapause (a state of physiological rest) given the dynamics of the predatory mites: this is achieved by solving an optimization problem hinging on the maximization of the prey population contribution to the next season. The main features of the optimal strategy for the prey are shown to be that (1) once in diapause, the prey does not become active again within the same season and hence diapause is an irreversible process; (2) {{for the vast majority of}} parameter space, the portion of prey individuals entering diapause within the season does not decrease in time; (3) with an increased number of predators, the optimal population strategy for the prey is to start diapause earlier and to enter diapause more gradually. This optimal population strategy will be studied for its ESS properties in a sequel to the work presented in this article...|$|R
