5|$|On July 12, 2008, Cheney {{underwent}} a cardiological exam; doctors reported that his heartbeat was normal for a 67-year-old {{man with a}} history of heart problems. As part of his annual checkup, he was administered an electrocardiogram and <b>radiological</b> <b>imaging</b> of the stents placed in the arteries behind his knees in 2005. Doctors said that Cheney had not experienced any recurrence of atrial fibrillation and that his special pacemaker had neither detected nor treated any arrhythmia. On October 15, 2008, Cheney returned to the hospital briefly to treat a minor irregularity.|$|E
25|$|Physiologically, {{increased}} pressure in utero, rickets and increased traction on the sternum due to abnormalities of the diaphragm have been postulated as specific mechanisms. Because {{the heart is}} located behind the sternum, and because individuals with pectus excavatum {{have been shown to}} have visible deformities of the heart seen both on <b>radiological</b> <b>imaging</b> and after autopsies, it has been hypothesized that there is impairment of function of the cardiovascular system in individuals with pectus excavatum. While some studies have demonstrated decreased cardiovascular function, no consensus has been reached based on newer physiological tests such as echocardiography of the presence or degree of impairment in cardiovascular function. Similarly, there is no consensus on the degree of functional improvement after corrective surgery; A 2013 meta-analysis yielded conflicting results.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{management}} of small bowel obstructions, a commonly quoted surgical aphorism is: [...] "never let the sun rise or set on small-bowel obstruction" [...] because about 5.5% of small bowel obstructions are ultimately fatal if treatment is delayed. However improvements in <b>radiological</b> <b>imaging</b> of small bowel obstructions allow for confident distinction between simple obstructions, that can be treated conservatively, and obstructions that are surgical emergencies (volvulus, closed-loop obstructions, ischemic bowel, incarcerated hernias, etc.).|$|E
40|$|During routine dissection, an {{uncommon}} variation {{was found in}} the renal vessels of a male cadaver. a Each kidney was found to have two renal veins and the branches of the renal artery lie outside the hilum. In the present scenario, it has become imperative for the surgeons understand the abnormalities of renal vasculature, as the utility of laparoscopic renal surgeries grew considerably. Otherwise such surgeries may be hampered by these anatomical variations. The presence of these abnormalities is also accountable in <b>radiological</b> <b>Imagings,</b> renal transplant, selective segmental clamping during partial Nephrectomy. Hence, this case report will throw light in the understanding of renal vasculature and its anatomical, embryological variations...|$|R
5000|$|Pseudothrombophlebitis is {{clinically}} {{indistinguishable from}} a true thrombophlebitis such as deep vein thrombosis; the symptoms and history are similar and these conditions cannot be distinguished by clinical examination without <b>radiological</b> or arthroscopic <b>imaging.</b>|$|R
40|$|Carcinoid tumor is a slow-growing type of neuroendocrine tumor, {{originating}} in the enterochromaffin cells and secreting mainly serotonin. The diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms, hormone levels, <b>radiological</b> and nuclear <b>imaging,</b> and histological confirmation. The clinical symptoms are characterized by flushing, diarrhea, abdominal pain, telangiectasia and/or bronchoconstriction. However, most patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis because the clinic goes unnoticed or are ascribed to other abdominal conditions. We report the clinical symptoms, hormone levels, <b>radiological</b> and nuclear <b>imaging,</b> histological diagnosis, treatment and evaluation of a 44 -year-old female patient with congestive heart failure secondary to carcinoid heart disease {{in the context of}} liver metastases of an ileum carcinoid tumor...|$|R
2500|$|On <b>radiological</b> <b>imaging,</b> {{most cases}} of LCLC-RP are single [...] "coin lesions" [...] or {{discrete}} masses, but cases presenting as multiple nodules throughout the lung {{have also been}} noted. Cases with inhomogeneous-appearing consolidation on CT have been reported, as well as aerogenous, lepidic-type spread. Some large, centrally located LCLC-RP have been noted {{to show signs of}} gross necrosis and cavitation on imaging studies, as well as being associated with the presence of large bullae.|$|E
2500|$|One {{study found}} that ten percent of polytrauma {{patients}} who had no clinical signs of abdominal injury did have evidence of such injuries using <b>radiological</b> <b>imaging.</b> [...] Diagnostic techniques used include CT scanning, ultrasound, and X-ray. [...] X-ray can help determine {{the path of a}} penetrating object and locate any foreign matter left in the wound, but may not be helpful in blunt trauma. Diagnostic peritoneal lavage is a controversial technique but can be used to detect injury to abdominal organs: a catheter is placed in the peritoneal cavity, and if fluid is present, it is aspirated and examined for blood or evidence of organ rupture. [...] If this does not reveal evidence of injury, sterile saline is infused into the cavity and evacuated and examined for blood or other material. [...] While peritoneal lavage is an accurate way to test for bleeding, it carries a risk of injuring the abdominal organs, may be difficult to perform, and may lead to unnecessary surgery; thus it has largely been replaced by ultrasound in Europe and North America. [...] Ultrasound can detect fluid such as blood or gastrointestinal contents in the abdominal cavity, and it is a noninvasive procedure and relatively safe for the patient. CT scanning is the preferred technique for people who are not at immediate risk of shock, but since ultrasound can be performed right in an emergency room, the latter is recommended for people who are not stable enough to move to CT scanning. [...] However, people with abdominal trauma frequently need CT scans for other trauma (for example, head or chest CT); in these cases abdominal CT can be performed at the same time without wasting time in patient care. [...] Diagnostic laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy may also be performed if other diagnostic methods do not yield conclusive results.|$|E

30|$|Treatment {{for breast}} cancer {{generally}} has two aspects. One is surgery for local control; the other is systemic treatment to limit or eliminate potentially metastatic disease. Sequential administration of anthracycline and taxane is recommended as systemic chemotherapy in neo-adjuvant or adjuvant settings, depending on risk factors such as metastasis in axillary lymph nodes. Once metastatic breast cancer (MBC) has been diagnosed with <b>radiological</b> or <b>imaging</b> assessments, {{it is very difficult}} to achieve complete eradication of MBC while maintaining both the length and the quality of patients’ lives.|$|R

40|$|Background: Literature on renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) in children is lacking. Occasional case report has been mentioned. Aims and objective of our study are to evaluate the clinical presentation and outcome in children with RCC. Patients and Methods: Records of 11 children and adolescence, from January 2007 to June 2011, who were treated for RCC were retrospectively analysed. Age, clinical presentation, any paraneoplastic symptom or sign, haematological, bio-chemical investigations, <b>radiological</b> <b>imaging′s,</b> operative details, pathological reports and treatment details were taken from hospital records and results were analysed. All patients were followed-up with complete haemogram, biochemical investigations, ultrasonography - whole abdomen and chest X-ray at 6 months interval and patients with stages 2 and 3 were also followed-up with contrast enhanced computed tomography - whole abdomen. They were followed-up for 2 - 5 years. Results: All had undergone open radical nephrectomy with eight hilar lymph node dissection and three formal lymphadenectomy. None had received adjuvant therapy. Four patients with stage 1 were well at 5, 4, 2. 5 and 2 years. One patient with stage 1 was lost to follow-up. Three patients with stage 2 were well at 4, 3 and 2 years of follow-up while three with stage 3 were well at 5, 4 and 2 years of follow-up. Conclusions: Lymph node dissection not only improves the survival, but it guides one the exact pathological staging and one can adopt the more aggressive follow-up in advanced pathological staging and strict follow-up is mandatory...|$|R

40|$|Intra-abdominal desmoid {{tumors are}} {{commonly}} associated with genetic syndromes such as familial polyposis coli. <b>Radiological</b> cross <b>imaging</b> studies such as CT and MRI {{are used in the}} preoperative work-up of such tumors. Postoperatively, CT and MRI are useful in the assessment of recurrent desmoid tumors. MRI is more accurate in tissue characterization. Where possible, surgical resection remains the standard first-line treatment. For patients where surgery is not possible, or the resection margins are not clear, other forms of treatment are possible. These include hormonal and nonhormonal options. We present a case of a recurrent sporadic intra-abdominal (mesenteric) desmoid tumor. Such an entity is rare with few cases reported in the literature.

40|$|We {{present the}} only case in English medical {{literature}} of a spinal neurofibroma misdiagnosed as a herniated disc using {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI). This case presented with typical symptoms and radiological findings of a herniated disc. Intraoperatively, an abnormality was noted at the S 1 nerve root sleeve. Further exploration revealed a spinal neurofibroma which was completely resected, resulting in an improvement in the patient’s symptoms. Currently, there is heavy reliance on MRI as a highly sensitive and specific tool used in the diagnosis of herniated lumbar discs. Although there have been occasional reports of misdiagnoses using MRI, there are no reported cases of a spinal neurofibroma being misdiagnosed as a herniated lumbar disc. Despite great advances in <b>radiological</b> diagnostic <b>imaging,</b> surgical surprises do still occur. Ultimately, instinct is still essential in intraoperative surgical decisions...|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} misclassification of type B injuries when using X-ray and CT-scans in clinical workaday life and to compile radiologic signs of type B 1 injuries were {{the aims of the}} retrospective study. 42 % of type B injuries were initially underdiagnosed as type A. To achieve a correct diagnosis, all clinical and radiological signs must be considered. 29 % of all type B 1 injuries cannot be detected via X-ray and CT-scan. Hence the aim of the prospective clinical study was to evaluate the accuracy of ultrasound imaging in the assessment of the PLC status in thoracolumbar fractures.

30|$|The {{number of}} CT scans {{of all types}} {{performed}} in the USA has quadrupled since 1993, and the same increasing trend has also been observed in Europe [15]. The increase in imaging utilization {{has led to a}} nearly sixfold increase in the per capita dose of radiation from medical imaging occurred in the USA between 1982 and 2007. Chest imaging exposing to ionizing radiation includes chest X-ray and chest CT but also coronary CT angiography, nuclear cardiology, invasive coronary angiography and angioplasty, which account for a significant percentage of all diagnostic examinations. The chest is the most frequently evaluated region of the body in children [15]. CT scans account for 8 % of exams in the paediatric population, and data show that they are often performed without adjusting exposure parameters to weight, resulting in up to 50 % of the dose being unnecessary [15]. Moreover, <b>radiological</b> chest <b>imaging</b> should be especially well justified and carefully optimized in women because from the radiobiological viewpoint the female breast is a highly radiosensitive organ [4].|$|R
