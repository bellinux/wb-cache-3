5000|$|The most {{commonly}} employed microstrip antenna is a rectangular patch {{which looks like}} a truncated microstrip transmission line. It is approximately of one-half wavelength long. When air is used as the dielectric substrate, the length of the rectangular microstrip antenna is approximately one-half of a free-space wavelength. As the antenna is loaded with a dielectric as its substrate, the length of the antenna decreases as the relative dielectric constant of the substrate increases. The <b>resonant</b> <b>length</b> of the antenna is slightly shorter because of the extended electric [...] "fringing fields" [...] which increase the electrical length of the antenna slightly. An early model of the microstrip antenna is a section of microstrip transmission line with equivalent loads on either end to represent the radiation loss.|$|E
50|$|The {{amount of}} signal {{received}} {{from a distant}} transmission source is essentially geometric in nature due to the inverse-square law, and {{this leads to the}} concept of effective area. This measures the performance of an antenna by comparing the amount of power it generates to the amount of power in the original signal, measured in terms of the signal's power density in Watts per square metre. A half-wave dipole has an effective area of 0.13 2. If more performance is needed, one cannot simply make the antenna larger. Although this would intercept more energy from the signal, due to the considerations above, it would decrease the output significantly due to it moving away from the <b>resonant</b> <b>length.</b> In roles where higher performance is needed, designers often use multiple elements combined together.|$|E

50|$|The second design {{involved}} a console, {{similar to that}} of a musical organ of the period, in which the operator manned a set of keys, one for each letter. The sounds were produced by a common bellows that fed air through various pipes with the appropriate shapes and obstructions needed to produce that letter. Through experimentation, he came to find that the reed’s <b>resonant</b> <b>length</b> was not crucial {{to the creation of the}} high-frequency components of certain vowels and fricatives, so he tuned them all to be the same pitch for the sake of consistency between letters. While not all letters were represented at this point, Kempelen had developed the technology required to produce most vowels and several consonants, including the plosive “p”, and the nasal “m”, and thus was in a position to begin forming syllables and short words. However, this immediately led to the primary flaw of his second design: the parallel nature of the multiple reeds allowed for more than one letter to be sounded at a time. And in the process of building syllables and words, the sonic “overlap” (now referred to as co-articulation) rendered sounds very uncharacteristic of human speech, undermining the intention of the design altogether. Kempelen comments: “In order to continue my experiments it was necessary, above all, that I should have a perfect knowledge of what I wanted to imitate. I had to make a formal study of speech and continually consult nature as I conducted my experiments. In this way my talking machine and my theory concerning speech made equal progress, the one serving as guide to the other.”3 “It was possible, following the methods I’d been using, to invent separate letters, but never to combine them to form syllables, and that it was absolutely necessary to follow nature which has only one glottis and one mouth, through which every sound emerges and which gives a unity to them.”23 Thus, Kempelen began work on his third, and ultimately final design, which itself was in many ways a “close-as-possible” representation of the physiology of the vocal tract.|$|E
5000|$|The third {{approach}} {{followed a}} similar design to the first, which was conceptually more {{faithful to the}} natural design of the human vocal tract than the second. It consisted, like before, of a bellows, a reed and a simulated mouth (this time made of India rubber, for better creation of vowel sounds via manipulation by hand), but also included a “throat” to which a “nasal cavity” was attached (complete with two “nostrils” for making the “n” and “m” sounds), {{as well as several}} levers and tubes dedicated to “s” and “sh” sounds, a rod that would interfere with the reeds vibration to make a rolling “r” sound, and a separate, smaller bellows that would allow air to pass the reed while the mouth was completely closed (a feature required for the “b” sound). At one point, a special valve intended to simulate the “f” fricative was included, but was later removed when it was revealed that the same sound could be achieved by simply closing all of the orifices of the machine and allowing air to leak from the cracks. Similarly, {{at one point in the}} design, there was an alternate “mouth” assembly consisting of a wooden box with a pair of hinged shutters that acted as lips. Inside the box resided a hinged, wooden, string-operated flap that acted as a tongue. The purpose of this assembly was to mimic the mouth and tongue in the construction of plosives such as “b” and “d”, but was later removed when Kempelen recognized that without a proper tongue, the machine would never be able to produce the “t”, “k”, “d” and “g” sounds. He found his way around this entire problem by replacing the “t” and “k” sounds with the “p” sound, and the “d” and “g” sounds with the “b” sound (which itself was simply a slight variation of the “p” sound). In the context of a familiar word, listeners often ignored the mispronunciation altogether (a phenomenon later explored by researchers in the field of cognitive science). Kempelen believed that people were more forgiving of the errors made by his machine due to the frequency of the reed and vocal tract <b>resonant</b> <b>length</b> he chose to use, which create a resonance much more like a young child, than that of an adult.23 This third design, unlike those before it, was completely capable of speaking complete phrases in French, Italian and English (German was possible, but required a greater skill-level by the operator, due to the more frequent use of consonants in the German language). Its greatest limitation was the bellows, which, although they were six times the capacity of human lungs, ran empty of air much faster than that of its human counterpart. Because the design was based on a single reed as the glottal sound-source, he had none of the problems of co-articulation that came inherently with the second design. But that single reed also meant that the Speaking Machine “spoke” in monotone4. Kempelen expended some time to try and introduce several prosodic pitch-variation mechanisms into the reed assembly, but to no avail. He decided to leave the design to be improved upon by the next batch of experimenters. All of these important additions for the third design came from the two decades of intensive research of the vocal tract in relation to spoken languages by Kempelen, for which the behavior of each crucial physiological element of speech production was scrutinized and replicated acoustically and/or mechanically.3 ...|$|E

The device is a loopless antenna design that incorporates both an insulating, dielectric coating and a winding of the antenna whip into a helical shape. Because this antenna produces a broad region of high SNR and also allows for imaging near {{the tip of the}} device, it is useful for imaging long, luminal structures. To elucidate the design and function of this device, the effects of both insulation and an-tenna winding were characterized by theoretical and experi-mental studies. Insulation broadens the longitudinal region over which images can be collected (i. e., along the lumen of a vessel) by increasing the <b>resonant</b> pole <b>length.</b> Antenna winding, con-versely, allows for imaging closer to the tip of the antenna by decreasing the <b>resonant</b> pole <b>length.</b> Over a longitudinal region of 20 cm, the IVES imaging antenna described here produces a system SNR of approximately 40, 000 /r (mL– 1 Hz 1 / 2), where r is the radial distance from the antenna axis in centimeters.

40|$|First-passage {{times in}} random walks have {{a vast number}} of diverse {{applications}} in physics, chemistry, biology, and finance. In general, environmental conditions for a stochastic process are not constant on the time scale of the average first-passage time, or control might be applied to reduce noise. We investigate moments of the first-passage time distribution under a transient describing relaxation of environmental conditions. We solve the Laplace-transformed (generalized) master equation analytically using a novel method that is applicable to general state schemes. The first-passage time {{from one end to the}} other of a linear chain of states is our application for the solutions. The dependence of its average on the relaxation rate obeys a power law for slow transients. The exponent ν depends on the chain length N like ν=-N/(N+ 1) to leading order. Slow transients substantially reduce the noise of first-passage times expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV), even if the average first-passage time is much longer than the transient. The CV has a pronounced minimum for some lengths, which we call <b>resonant</b> <b>lengths.</b> These results also suggest a simple and efficient noise control strategy, and are closely related to the timing of repetitive excitations, coherence resonance and information transmission by noisy excitable systems.

40|$|Cycle length {{selection}} in corridor timing is often dictated by critical intersections {{with the highest}} level of saturation. Along corridors with balanced volumes and favorable link distances, a <b>resonant</b> cycle <b>length</b> is often sought to provide good progression in both directions of travel. This paper discusses the search for a <b>resonant</b> cycle <b>length</b> at a 5 -intersection corridor in Fishers, Indiana over a three month period. The software traffic model suggests a reasonable range of cycle lengths from 104 seconds to 124 seconds for the corridor. This cycle length range is consistent with analytical highway capacity manual delay minimization approaches. A set of eleven cycle lengths from the 104 to 124 -second range are tested over 12 weeks, with each iteration using optimized offset values generated by the Link Pivot progression optimization algorithm to maximize the percentage of vehicles arriving on green, and holding all phase splits constant. There was no obvious resonant cycle identified in the cycle length sweep, however the experiment findings indicate vehicles arriving on green decrease and travel times increase as cycle length increases. As a tradeoff, the number of force off phase terminations on the side-street phases decrease as a result of longer cycles indicating a better accommodation of sidestreet demand. Finally, a Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SURE) model was used to analyze the correlation between cycle lengths, percent of vehicles arriving on green, and travel time indicating a negative correlation between higher cycle length and progression performance...|$|R
