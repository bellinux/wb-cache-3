At Zion, the limestones and fossils of the Timpoweap, Virgin Limestone, and Shnabkaib members of the Moenkopi Formation document transgressive episodes. Unlike the Timpoweap and Virgin Limestone members, the Shnabkaib contains abundant gypsum and interbedded mudstone resulting from deposition in a restricted marine environment with complex watertable fluctuations. Regressive, red bed layers separate the transgressive strata. <b>Ripple</b> <b>marks,</b> mud cracks, and thinly laminated bedding suggest that these intervening red shale and siltstone units were deposited in tidal flat and coastalplain environments.|$|E

40|$|Many sole marks {{consisting}} of the longitudinal current ridge marks and small flute-like marks, {{were found on the}} upper and lower surfaces between the mudstone and sandstone beds in the galleries of the Taishu mine. In the Taishu mine area, there are three sandstone beds, viz. the Tsurue, Senninmabu, and Nimyaku; and two fault systems, viz. one is the N-S normal fault, and the other is the NE-SW reverse fault along the bedding plane between the mudstone and sandstone beds. These faults are important, as they are in close connection with the ore deposits. Many galleries extend along the bedding plane which forms the hanging wall of the gallery {{consisting of}} the sandstone bed. The reverse fault plane of the strike direction appears more often in the 3 to 5 mm lower horizon, than {{on the surface of the}} mudstone bed. Accordingly the authors have often found thin mudstone plates adhering to the bottom surface of the sandstone bed forming the hanging wall, which dips generally 30 to 40 degrees southeastward. The casts of the sole marks occur on the upper surface of these thin mudstone plates, and the moulds on the lower surface of the sandstone bed. The longitudinal ridge marks consist of narraw hollows and ridges. The hollows range from 3 to 10 mm in width; several mm to 7 cm in length; and about 1 mm in depth. According to DZULYNSKI's experiment, such marks are formed by a less turbulent and more regular flow of water. The small flute-like mark is found on the bottom surface of the Nimyaku sandstone bed. The small rounded mark is 1 to 5 mm in diameter, and the connecting mark is 1 to 2 cm in length. Its height is about 1 mm. Averages of twenty five directions of sole marks and bedding planes on the bottom surface of the Senninmabu sandstone bed are respectively N 70 ° E, dip 24 ° and N 30 ° E, dip 36 ° E.

Spikes with ripples were on average shorter, had higher amplitude and higher slope than spikes without ripples. 64 % of ripples started before spikes started.
