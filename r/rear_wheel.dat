5|$|Recumbent bicycles. Long-wheelbase recumbents {{require a}} good rear brake as the CG {{is near the}} <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel)</b> the center of mass is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b> Mass over the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the front wheel.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque at the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> {{to lift the}} front wheel off {{the ground in a}} maneuver called a wheelie. A line similar to the one described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although there is much less power available, if the center of mass is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.|$|E

50|$|The system {{electronically}} controlled a rear rack {{that was}} behind the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> At low speeds (up to 35 km/h), the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> move {{in the opposite direction}} from the front wheels, aiding parking and U-turns by lowering the turning circle. Above these speeds, the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> move {{in the same direction as}} the front, meaning control during high-speed maneuvers such as lane changes or cornering was improved. Either way, the turning angle of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> was slight at just 5°, a measurement Mazda determined to be optimally effective and natural to human sensitivity.|$|R
2500|$|... 3) Three-channel, three-sensor ABS: This scheme, {{commonly}} found on pickup trucks with four-wheel ABS, has a speed sensor and a valve {{for each of}} the front wheels, with one valve and one sensor for both <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> The speed sensor for the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> is located in the rear axle. This system provides individual control of the front wheels, so they can both achieve maximum braking force. The <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> however, are monitored together; they both have to start to lock up before the ABS will activate on the rear. With this system, it is possible that one of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> will lock during a stop, reducing brake effectiveness. This system is easy to identify, as there are no individual speed sensors for the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{steering}} ratio is the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire {{behavior and the}} actual turning radius. Values less than one, where the front wheel side slip {{is greater than the}} <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> side slip, are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which the front wheel must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> side slip than front wheel have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend to prefer neutral or slight over-steering. Car drivers tend to prefer under-steering.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> is {{prevented}} from precessing {{as the front}} wheel does by friction of the tires on the ground, and so continues to lean {{as though it were}} not spinning at all. Hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping.|$|E
5|$|For the {{original}} model, Holden replaced the long-serving Kingswood and Premier large executive cars developed in Australia, with another <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> drive (RWD) platform that was, however, {{based on a}} smaller European design by Opel, re-engineered for Australian conditions. Subsequent series became larger, culminating with the fourth generation Commodore, fully developed in Australia {{and based on the}} GM Zeta platform.|$|E

50|$|Most torque {{vectoring}} differentials are on all-wheel drive vehicles. A basic {{torque vectoring}} differential varies torque between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> This means that, under normal driving conditions, the front wheels receive a set percentage of the engine torque, and the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> receive the rest. If needed, the differential can transfer more torque between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> to improve vehicle performance.|$|R
50|$|E-4WD is {{a system}} used by Nissan that drives two <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> with an {{electric}} motor to supplement the traction available to a front wheel drive vehicle. This avoids the complication of installing a drive shaft to transfer power to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> It also increases efficiency as when additional traction is not needed the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> can be completely disengaged from the drive train. The system was developed by Hitachi.|$|R
5|$|A highsider, highside, or {{high side}} {{is a type of}} bike motion which is caused by a <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> gaining {{traction}} when it is not facing in the direction of travel, usually after slipping sideways in a curve. This can occur under heavy braking, acceleration, a varying road surface, or suspension activation, especially due to interaction with the drive train. It can {{take the form of a}} single slip-then-flip or a series of violent oscillations.|$|E
5|$|The chassis was {{manufactured}} from aluminium using Alcan's bonded aluminium structure vehicle technology (ASVT), {{and had a}} wheelbase of 2845mm. The {{design for}} the chassis featured <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> steering and packaged the fuel tank behind the centre bulkhead. Suspension design largely focused on road use, but a good compromise for racing use was achieved and the suspension height was adjustable. The concept car was fitted with a four-channel anti-lock braking system.|$|E
5|$|The net {{aerodynamic}} drag forces {{may be considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure. At high speeds, this will create a net moment about the rear driving wheel and result in a net transfer of load from the front wheel to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b> Also, depending on {{the shape of the}} bike and the shape of any fairing that might be installed, aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on the front wheel.|$|E
50|$|Earlier HICAS {{versions}} used hydraulics {{to steer}} the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> The hydraulic system was powered by the power steering pump and used speed sensors {{to determine how much}} and in which direction {{to steer the}} <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The kite buggy's <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are mounted}} {{at the ends}} of the rear axle. The front wheel is mounted in the front fork. In {{advanced}} buggy designs either or both front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> can be attached via suspension mechanisms.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an active}} four-wheel {{steering}} system, all four wheels {{turn at the}} same time when the driver steers. In most active four-wheel steering systems, the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> are steered by a computer and actuators. The <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> generally cannot turn as far as the front wheels. There can be controls to switch off the rear steer and options to steer only the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> independently of the front wheels. At low speed (e.g. parking) the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> turn opposite to the front wheels, reducing the turning radius, sometimes critical for large trucks, tractors, vehicles with trailers and passenger cars with a large wheelbase, while at higher speeds both front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> turn alike (electronically controlled), so that the vehicle may change position with less yaw and improved build-up of the lateral acceleration, enhancing straight-line stability. The [...] "snaking effect" [...] experienced during motorway drives while towing a travel trailer is thus largely nullified.|$|R
5|$|The <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> pods {{introduced}} to IndyCar in 2012 {{intended to prevent}} cars from becoming airborne when hitting another in the rear proved to be ineffective as there were major crashes resulting from such contact during the 2013 race in Houston involving Dario Franchitti and the 2017 Indianapolis 500 involving Scott Dixon. In addition the pods were often ripped from cars from light contact, placing hazardous debris on the track. As a result the rear pods were eliminated for 2018.|$|E
5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect {{to the point where the}} front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
5|$|As dusk {{began to}} fall on the drying track, the No. 8 Peugeot {{suffered}} from <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> hub failures which required two lengthy visits to the garage. This allowed the No. 1 Audi to take over second place. Jacques Villeneuve's No. 7 Peugeot also lost time, which dropped it to two laps behind the No. 2 Audi. The No. 1 Audi had its own brief moment when the No. 63 Corvette clipped the Audi's rear end. The Corvette was forced to take evasive action through the Dunlop Chicane's gravel trap, and the Audi required replacement rear bodywork on its next pit stop.|$|E
5000|$|As {{described}} earlier, SH-AWD {{can vary}} torque {{side to side}} through the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> This ability to drive one of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> with more power (remember the row boat analogy) is accomplished through overdriving the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> {{with respect to the}} front wheels. The Acura RL is designed with a third planetary gear set and clutch pack that are packaged into a so-called [...] "Acceleration Device", which is bolted in front of the rear differential unit. [...] The Acceleration Device allows torque to be passed to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> at a near one to one ratio, but in cornering situations, the Acceleration Device variably increases the torque passed to the rear up to 5%, depending on the cornering situation.|$|R
50|$|Brakes: Drum brake only on <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|The wheels were {{independently}} sprung, the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> being {{attached to}} a swing axle and supported by springs with hydraulic shock absorbers. All four wheels were connected to the foot brake via a hydraulic system, while the hand brake was a mechanical one operating on the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5|$|How much {{braking force}} {{to apply to}} each wheel depends both on ground {{conditions}} and on the balance of weight on the wheels at each instant in time. The total braking force cannot exceed the gravity force on the rider and bike times the coefficient of friction µ of the tire on the ground. mgµ >= Ff + Fr. A skid occurs if the ratio of either Ff over Nf or Fr over Nr is greater than µ, with a <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> skid having less of {{a negative impact on}} lateral stability.|$|E
5|$|Third, {{because the}} front and rear tires can have {{different}} slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. When understeering, the steering angle must be greater, and when oversteering, the steering angle must be less than it would be if the slip angles were equal to maintain a given turn radius. Some authors even use the term counter-steering to refer to the need on some bikes under some conditions to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> slippage.|$|E
5|$|Tires {{generate}} the lateral forces necessary for steering and balance {{through a combination}} of cornering force and camber thrust. Tire inflation pressures have also been found to be important variables in the behavior of a motorcycle at high speeds. Because the front and rear tires can have different slip angles due to weight distribution, tire properties, etc., bikes can experience understeer or oversteer. Of the two, understeer, in which the front wheel slides more than the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel,</b> is more dangerous since front wheel steering is critical for maintaining balance.|$|E

50|$|A Dana-Spicer 5-speed model 6453 {{synchromesh}} {{manual transmission}} {{had a very}} low 1st, direct 4th, and overdrive 5th. A Rockwell-Standard 2-speed transfer case also engaged the front axle automatically if the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> turned faster than the front, as when the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> spun, in any gear and any range.|$|R

5|$|At that point, Garin was leading, with Émile Georget {{almost two}} hours behind. In the fifth stage, Georget had two flat tires, {{and fell asleep}} when {{he stopped at the}} side of the road to rest; he failed to finish. Thus Garin {{extended}} his lead by winning this stage, carrying nearly three hours' advantage into the final day's racing. Garin had requested other cyclists in the leading group to let him win the stage, but Fernand Augereau refused to do this. Garin then had Lucien Pothier throw down his bicycle in front of Augereau, who fell, and Garin then bent Augereau's <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b> Augereau quickly obtained a spare bike and continued to the finish, however Garin easily won the sprint. Augereau still received a prize of 100 francs from Velo-Sport Nantes for the fastest final kilometer of the stage in the Nantes velodrome.|$|E
5|$|Following the Austrian Grand Prix on 16 July, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at three circuits from 18–21 July {{to prepare for}} the Grand Prix. McLaren, Benetton, Jordan, Jaguar, Sauber and BAR went to Silverstone over three days. Olivier Panis, McLaren's test driver, set the fastest time {{on the first day of}} testing. Jaguar test driver Luciano Burti crashed at Stowe corner where his car's suspension, front and rear wings, and sidepod were damaged. The resulting incident caused a brief halt to testing and Jaguar shipped a spare car for the next day's testing. Panis remained fastest on the second day. Trulli damaged his suspension and rear wing, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Burti suffered another incident when he lost his right <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b> Fisichella topped the third and final day's running. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent four days at the Fiorano Circuit where he concentrated on testing engine and aerodynamic development whilst Michael Schumacher did practice starts and component testing on the fourth day.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} lap Irvine overtook his {{teammate}} Herbert for tenth position. Wurz {{crashed into the}} barriers at turn 1 {{and was forced to}} retire. Gené retired on lap 22 with a gearbox issue as his teammate Mazzacane subsequently collided with the barriers at turn one on the same lap and had to retire from the event. Herbert became the first driver to make a pit stop on lap 27 although his pit crew came unprepared and Herbert was stationary for half a minute before he exited in 17th position. On the 31st lap, Diniz made contact with the barriers at turn one and he damaged his left <b>rear</b> <b>wheel,</b> causing him to retire. Häkkinen's pace was reduced by lap 36 as he slowed with an blockage on his brake pedal and made an unscheduled pit stop. His team's mechanics opened his car's inspection hatch and rearranged radio cables. They subsequently removed a data transmitter which was the cause the blockage and Häkkinen rejoined in 9th. Trulli became the next retirement of the race when he pulled {{to the side of the}} track with a gearbox problem on the following lap.|$|E
50|$|Drift trikes are {{tricycles}} {{that have}} slick <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> normally {{made from a}} hard plastic, often PVC. They are designed to drift, by intentionally initiating loss of traction to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> and counter-steering to negotiate corners. They are usually ridden on paved roads with steep downhill gradients, with corners and switchbacks.|$|R
50|$|The 4.4 m long Econovan Maxi {{offered a}} high roof, 2.0-litre petrol engine with {{five-speed}} manual of four-speed automatic, single <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> and three-seater steel-sided or six seater XL window-sided forms. Dual <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> {{were available for}} the 2.0-litre petrol or a 2.2-litre diesel, both with five-speed manual and as steel-sided vans.|$|R
2500|$|SH-AWD ("Super Handling" [...] All Wheel Drive) is a multi-vectoring all {{wheel drive}} system {{designed}} more for performance than for simply providing traction in adverse circumstances. While cruising, the system sends 90% of the power to the front wheels and 10% to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> Acceleration puts more torque on the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> The car can put up to 70% of the total available power to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> to assist with rapid acceleration, and of that 70%, 100% can be pushed to either {{the left or right}} wheel in order to assist the vehicle through a corner.|$|R
