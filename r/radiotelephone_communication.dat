5000|$|The AN/ARC-5 Command Radio Set is {{a series}} of radio receivers, transmitters, and {{accessories}} carried aboard U.S. Navy aircraft during World War II and for some years afterward. It is described as [...] "a complete multi-channel radio transmitting and receiving set providing communication and navigation facilities for aircraft. The LF-MF-HF components are designed to transmit and receive voice, tone-modulated, and continuous wave (cw) signals." [...] Its flexible design provided AM <b>radiotelephone</b> voice <b>communication</b> and MCW and CW Morse code modes, all of which are typical capabilities in other Navy aircraft communication sets of the period. It was an improvement of the Navy's ARA/ATA command set. Similar units designated SCR-274-N were used in U.S. Army aircraft. The Army set is based on the ARA/ATA, not the later AN/ARC-5. The ARA/ATA and SCR-274-N series are informally referred to as [...] "ARC-5", despite small differences that render all three series incompatible. Like the AN/ARC-5, the ARA/ATA and SCR-274-N had AM voice communication and two-way MCW and CW Morse code capability.|$|R

50|$|Because of {{the lack}} of {{legitimate}} opportunities, United was instead primarily used by company insiders to prey upon the hopes (or greed) of persons who remembered the large profits made by some early investors in telegraph and, to an even greater extent, telephone companies. United Wireless promotional materials painted a glowing picture of the company's future, including claims that their engineers would soon perfect audio transmissions, bringing income from subscribers using <b>radiotelephones</b> for personal <b>communication</b> or for listening to entertainment broadcasts. United management continued to offer new shares to the unwary at inflated prices, while enforcing restrictions designed to artificially boost the apparent stock value. A common practice was to include a clause that blocked resale of stock on the open market, by refusing to register transferred shares. These restrictions meant that United's management could declare arbitrary stock valuations that increased at regular intervals, eventually reaching $50, allowing the company to claim fictitious appreciation that was never tested on the open market.|$|R
5000|$|... 1XE was revived {{after the}} {{conclusion}} of the war, and the station reportedly began some degree of voice and music broadcasts in 1919. However, information about the entertainment broadcasts, both before and immediately after World War One, is very limited. In 1930, one former employee remembered [...] "playing phonograph records and reading jokes out of magazines in between pieces" [...] beginning in the late summer of 1920. In December 1920, Filene's department store advertised radio receivers that were [...] "a creation of a company out in Medford", and which had been used to listen [...] "to a concert given in Medford". However, during this period the broadcasts appear to have been irregularly conducted. AMRAD's primary focus after the war was adopting the <b>radiotelephone</b> for personal <b>communication,</b> and a November 1920 article about the company in the Boston Sunday Post reviewed the possibility of using wireless telephones for communication, particularly in automobiles, but didn't make any references to broadcasting activities.|$|R
5000|$|Fessenden's basic {{approach}} was disclosed in U.S. Patent 706,737, which {{he applied for}} on May 29, 1901, and was issued the next year. It called {{for the use of}} a high-speed alternator (referred to as [...] "an alternating-current dynamo") that generated [...] "pure sine waves" [...] and produced [...] "a continuous train of radiant waves of substantially uniform strength", or, in modern terminology, a continuous-wave (CW) transmitter. Fessenden began his research on audio transmissions while doing developmental work for the United States Weather Service on Cobb Island, Maryland. Because he did not yet have a continuous-wave transmitter, initially he worked with an experimental [...] "high-frequency spark" [...] transmitter, taking advantage {{of the fact that the}} higher the spark rate, the closer a spark-gap transmission comes to producing continuous waves. He later reported that, in the fall of 1900, he successfully transmitted speech over a distance of about 1.6 kilometers (one mile), which appears to have been the first successful audio transmission using radio signals. However, at this time the sound was far too distorted to be commercially practical. For a time he continued working with more sophisticated high-frequency spark transmitters, including versions that used compressed air, which began to take on some of the characteristics of arc-transmitters. Fessenden attempted to sell this form of <b>radiotelephone</b> for point-to-point <b>communication,</b> but was unsuccessful.|$|R

50|$|Guevara was {{instrumental}} in creating the clandestine radio station Radio Rebelde (Rebel Radio) in February 1958, which broadcast news to the Cuban people with statements by the 26th of July movement, and provided <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>communication</b> between {{the growing number of}} rebel columns across the island. Guevara had apparently been inspired to create the station by observing the effectiveness of CIA supplied radio in Guatemala in ousting the government of Jacobo Ãrbenz GuzmÃ¡n.|$|E
5000|$|AMRAD began {{operating}} {{an experimental}} station, 1XE, in 1917. [...] After the United States entered World War One, {{an executive order}} issued on April 7, 1917 made it illegal for civilians to possess a working radio receiver, and the government took control {{of most of the}} radio industry. During the conflict AMRAD received several profitable military contracts, and appears to {{have been one of the}} few civilian organizations allowed to conduct radio transmissions during the war. On February 21, 1919, a few months before the October 1919 date when the general ban on civilian transmitters was lifted, AMRAD announced that it would attempt to establish two-way <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>communication</b> with the George Washington as it approached Boston.|$|E
5000|$|The {{broadcasts}} {{became a}} vital source of communication {{due to increased}} government restrictions on the Cuban press. A new boosted transmitter in La Plata carried lengthy interviews and speeches by Fidel Castro and provided <b>radiotelephone</b> <b>communication</b> between the rebel columns throughout the region. Expansions in rebel numbers and more ambitious military ventures away from the group's base in the Sierra Maestra meant that each fighting column needed its own radio equipment. Eventually 32 Rebelde stations were operating throughout Cuba. The stations broadcast nightly, with each broadcast beginning with the loud declaration [...] "Â¡AquÃ­ Radio Rebelde!" [...] ("Here Radio Rebelde!") that has remained the station's trademark salutation to the present day, followed by the Cuban national anthem and the 26th of July hymn.|$|E
