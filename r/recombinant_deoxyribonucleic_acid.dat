METHODS: A duplex Polymerase Chain Reaction based on the amplification of the lectin gene and the construction of the <b>recombinant</b> <b>deoxyribonucleic</b> <b>acid</b> of transgenic glyphosate-tolerant soybean (35 S promoter and chloroplast transit peptide gene) was performed in order to analyze the deoxyribonucleic acid obtained from nine soy protein isolate-containing formulas.

However, amplicons relative to the presence of Roundup Ready soybean were restricted to one of the nine enteral nutrition formulas analyzed {{as well as to the}} soybean reference powder, as expected.
