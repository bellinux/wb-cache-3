40|$|Meat {{inspection}} is up {{for debate}} and one issue deals with how to handle chronic cases of pyaemia/ osteomyelitis in finishing pigs. In Denmark, such carcasses are required to be de-boned to avoid presence of osteomyelitis {{not found in the}} <b>rework</b> <b>area.</b> Around 40, 000 pigs (0. 24 %) are subjected to de-boning in Denmark per year, and the associated costs amount to approx. € 3 million. The questions are: 1) is the meat from such pigs fit for human consumption? 2) Is de-boning necessary, or do the meat inspectors find what they should in the <b>rework</b> <b>area?</b> And 3) which alternative practices could replace de-boning? To address this, data covering 1 year were extracted from the Danish Slaughterhouse Database including information from the 7 largest Danish abattoirs. Registration schemes covering findings during de-boning and the result of de-boning (approved/ condemned) were provided by the individual abattoirs. Additionally, a questionnaire survey was undertaken regarding the de-boning personals’ experience related to de-boning. Furthermore, samples from 102 pigs sent for de-boning at one slaughterhouse were collected. These samples included abscesses found in pigs at the <b>rework</b> <b>area</b> plus one muscle sample per pig. All samples underwent microbiological investigation. As a control group, microbiological results obtained from a similar study from carcasses unconditionally approved at meat inspection were included. Staphylococcus aureus, which has the potential to cause human illness, was found in 15 abscesses and 1 muscle of the 102 pigs sent for de-boning. S. aureus was also found in 1 of the 60 control samples. The results were included in a risk assessment that revealed the same very low health risk related to consumption of meat from de-boned pigs as from fully accepted pigs. Abscesses were found at de-boning in a low proportion of the pigs, at different sites of the carcass, varying between abattoirs. The vast majority of pigs sent for de-boning were accepted after de-boning (99. 7 %). If routine de-boning is no longer required, then focus on a thorough inspection at the rework-area will most likely result in a higher probability of finding abscesses at that stage of inspection. Moreover, overlooked abscesses will be found during cutting. Therefore de-boning is not considered necessary and could be replaced by condemnation of the affected part(s) only...|$|E

York Timbers manufacture high quality timber products for local and international markets. All four saw mills are controlled and monitored by their head office in Sabie, Mpumalanga. Recently {{it has been observed}} that the Driekop dry mill in Graskop cannot fulfil all the orders that are received resulting from limited or no availability of products. Each saw mill has among other areas, a dry mill and <b>rework</b> <b>area.</b> There are several employees working at each of the processes that occur in the dry mill. There is a constant flow of products through the dry mill. The Driekop mill experiences difficulties with operations in their dry mill such as ineffective storage of work-in-progress and finished products and poor control over inventory. This is due to the absence of a fixed storage plan for work-in-progress and finished products. These problems are inhibiting optimum product flow and affect the functionality {{of the rest of the}} plant. There is urgent need for improved product flow through the dry mill as well as a storage plan to improve inventory control. A new layout will be developed for the dry mill area using Systematic Layout Planning (SLP) to better locate and access stacks. Industrial Engineering best practices for inventory management will assist in developing the storage plan and lean manufacturing techniques will be used to help eliminate the types of waste present. Overall improved product flow through the dry mill and <b>rework</b> <b>area</b> will be achieved to increase the daily number of products produced. Thesis (B Eng.

One of its key assets was the management of an observatory platform, named IberArray, aimed to provide new geophysical datasets (seismic, GPS, MT) to constrain the structure of Iberia with unprecedented resolution. The IberArray seismic pool was composed by 70 + BB stations, covering the study area in 3 deployments with a site-density of 60 km x 60 km. The data base holds ~ 300 sites, including the permanent networks in the area. Hence it forms a unique seismic database in Europe that allows for multiple analyses to constrain the complex geodinamics of the Western Mediterranean. A summary of new results coming from different techniques is presented here. The SKS splitting analysis has provided a spectacular image of {{the rotation of the}} fast velocity direction along the Gibraltar Arc. In central and northern Iberia, the fast polarization directions are close to EW, consistently with global mantle flow models considering contributions of surface plate motion, density variations and net lithosphere rotation. Those results suggest an asthenospheric origin of the observed anisotropy related to present-day mantle flow. Receiver functions have revealed the crustal thickness variations beneath the Atlas, Rif and southern Iberia, evidencing a relevant crustal root beneath the Rif, in agreement with recent, high- density active seismic experiments. The Variscan Iberian massif shows a flat Moho discontinuity, while the <b>areas</b> <b>reworked</b> in the Alpine orogeny show a slightly thicker crust.

The primary objective of COBO is to integrate emerging and innovative technologies from different disciplines (physics, chemistry, biology, and imagery) to provide in situ experimentation and monitoring of sediment ecosystems. The Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) leads a workpackage within the COBO-project developing an Integrated Sediment Disturber (ISD), {{in order to understand the}} complex interactions between the biota (their functioning and diversity) and environmental pertubations. The ISD frame carries three rotating fork-like disturber units, which will repeatedly rework surface sediments simulating physical disturbances. Disturber arms are 50 cm in length generating a circular <b>reworked</b> <b>area</b> of about 0. 75 m². Three disturbed zones and an undisturbed control area will be monitored continuously using a digital camera and a microprofiler with oxygen microelectrodes. To study disturbance effects on the benthic community sediment sampling will be carried out using coring devices handled either by divers or a remotely controlled vehicle (ROV). This will allow the investigation of biodiversity shifts in response to pertubation and the changing chemical condition of the sediment. The ISD frame can be lowered to the seafloor on a wire (shallow-water version), however, there are attachment points for floats allowing to convert the ISD frame into a free-falling device (bottom-lander version). Integrated observations of the natural environment at high spatial and temporal resolution will enable a quantitative description of the fundamental processes governing the interaction between the biota and its chemical environment in the sediment.

After producing the data files, each stream reach is analyzed for channel shift and meander characteristics using a computer program called MEANDER. The program measures various components of stream shift, the most important of which is the average normal shift. It also measures sinuosity, time rate of change of sinuosity, average curvature, and rate of flood plain <b>area</b> <b>reworking</b> by the stream for the reach in question. A probability distribution curve for normal shift is produced for each stream analyzed. The shift measurement process is described in Chapter 5. Stream reaches are presented beginning on page 2. A ground photo, aerial photos, base map, and digitized map are included for each reach. Hydrologic and geomorphic data are also presented for each reach. The results of the computer analysis are presented as well. The results of the computer analysis for the stream reaches are used in regression analyses to try to determine relations between stream shift properties and stream parameters.

40|$|Submarine {{portions}} of Stromboli volcano {{account for about}} 98 % of the whole extent of the volcanic edifice and are mostly covered by volcaniclastic sediments that made up a modern volcaniclastic apron. The architecture and main sedimentary processes acting within the apron are depicted through the integration of geophysical evidence (multibeam, long-range side scan sonar and seismic data) and seafloor sampling. The apron shows, on the whole, a large variability both across and along slope of morphologies and deposits related to mass-wasting and reworking processes, passing into areas covered by hemipelagic sedimentation. A large spectrum of erosive-depositional features was recognized {{on the surface of}} the apron. On shallower areas (i. e. submerged shelves, shore platforms and depositional terraces), submarine features related to wave action and sea-level fluctuations are present; they mainly act as temporary storing and <b>reworking</b> <b>areas</b> for volcaniclastic material derived from subaerial portions. Unconfined cohesionless inertial flows commonly dominate the upper slope, where gradients are very high (up to 35 degrees) and grain-to-grain and grain-to-bed collisions are favoured within the flows. These flows tend to evolve into turbidity currents on the lower slope, in response to a marked decrease of slope gradients below similar to 8 degrees, generating various erosive-depositional features, such as erosive furrows, troughs, channel-levee features and coarse-grained sediment waves. The most active area of the apron lies offshore Sciara del Fuoco (on the NW flank), where a large amount of coarse-grained volcaniclastic material, derived by the persistent Strombolian activity, is collected and deposited by means of high- and low-density turbidity currents on the lower slope down to 2600 mbsl, more than 20 km far from the island. Conversely, other areas are mostly dominated by deposition via settling of suspended sediments, related both to hemipelagic sedimentation and to the dispersion of fine tephras by the prevailing wind and marine currents. Such processes interfinger and overlie in space and time, giving rise to a very complex morpho-sedimentary facies distribution. However, the structural bilateral symmetry of Stromboli volcano allows defining distinct morpho-sedimentary zones, where one (or more) type of processes dominates, and related different stratal architecture of the apron. The unbuttressed {{portions of}} the island (NW and SE) are characterized by the emplacement of wide and thick debris avalanche deposits (volume in the order of 1 - 2 km(3) for each event) related to large-scale sector collapses, representing the most important and efficient mass-wasting processes making up the apron. Such deposits are embedded within different volcaniclastic sequences and can be eroded or exhumed by successive gravity flows. The result is a highly complex (both spatially and vertically) succession of facies, where it is often difficult to depict an arranged series of processes. Conversely, on buttressed flanks (SW and NE) a more ordered evolution of processes and deposits making up the apron is observed, giving rise to a less complex apron architecture. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.

In this instance causality was not considered to be linear, proportional or incremental, but multi‐dimensional whereby each factor is interrelated and multi‐causal in nature. Findings – The findings reveal that the cause of rework in this case was poor information flow and the absence of a quality focus. This was exacerbated by the sequential procurement process and fixed power structure of the contract, and as a consequence poor decision‐making, communication, integration and co‐ordination were experienced. Practical implications – The research has highlighted the need to re‐design the structure of supply chains in construction projects, especially if information and communication technologies are to be effectively used. A conceptual model was developed from the case study findings to illustrate the interconnectedness of factors affecting rework. This model can be used by organisations for reducing the incidence of rework. Originality/value – The research has identified key variables that can contribute to the incidence of rework in projects. A pragmatic model for reducing the incidence of rework is proposed. The model that is propagated will be of use to practitioners and researchers working within project environments...|$|R
40|$|The Middle Jurassic (Upper Bathonian/Lower Callovian) sands and {{sandstones}} of the Cracow–Wieluń Upland contain detrital garnets {{with high}} {{contents of the}} pyrope molecule (30 – 73 mol %). The predominance of detrital pyrope garnets, and inclusions represented mainly by omphacite and kyanite, show that the garnets were derived from high (ultrahigh) pressure (H/UHP) metamorphic terrane rocks (garnet peridotites, eclogites and granulites). Their source is unknown. The Moldanubian Zone of the Bohemian Massif is closely comparable. However, the terranes between this zone and the Cracow–Wieluń Upland are dominated by almandine garnets. The relatively low proportion of almandine garnets in the examined samples indicates that transport of the detrital material {{could not have been}} from a far distant source as the garnet assemblage would otherwise be strongly dominated by almandine. A less distant possible source could have been the Góry Sowie Mts., which incorporate UHP/HP metamorphic rocks, but the exposed areal extent of these rocks is too small. It is possible that larger portions of these metamorphic rocks are buried beneath the Cenozoic cover and might have earlier represented a larger source <b>area.</b> <b>Reworking</b> of the entire heavy mineral spectra from older clastics is improbable because of the low maturity of the heavy mineral assemblages (higher proportion of less stable minerals). The source area therefore remains unknown. Most probably it was formed by primary crystalline complexes of lower crust to mantle origin, outcrops of which were not far distant from the area of deposition. Similar detrital garnet compositions were also recorded in the Outer Western Carpathians (Flysch Zone, Pieniny Klippen Belt), i. e. the crustal segments which formed the Silesian and Magura cordilleras; the Czorsztyn Swell was also formed by similar rocks...|$|R
40|$|Sediment {{reworking}} {{rates by}} the surface deposit-feeding bivalve Abra ovata were assessed in thin aquaria using an automated image analysis procedure for luminophore tracer particles. Experiments were carried in winter (10 °C) and summer (20 °C), and three food treatments were tested: no food addition (CF), low food addition (LF) and high food addition (HF). The rate of sediment reworking was characterized in four different ways: (1) the maximum penetration depth of luminophores (MPD), (2) {{the proportion of}} reworked sediment surface (PRS) from which individual rates of surface <b>area</b> <b>reworking</b> (IRSAR) were derived, (3) the fitting of the standard biodiffusion model resulting in a biodiffusion coefficient Db, and (4) {{the application of a}} new non-local bioturbation model that produced an alternative mixing intensity DbNL. In winter, sediment reworking was low and was not affected by food availability. In contrast, during summer, reworking activity was very high and significantly affected by food availability. This suggests that temperature and not food availability controls sediment reworking during wintertime. Although the biodiffusive and non-local models produced similar values for mixing intensities after 48 h, the non-local model gave markedly better fits during the initial stage of the experiment. This agrees nicely with theoretical predictions: over short-time scales the non-local model should provide a more accurate description of bioturbation, but as the number of bioturbation events increases, the non-local model should converge to the biodiffusion one. Yet, an additional advantage of the non-local model is that it allows constraining two crucial parameters characterizing A. ovata bioturbation: the average distance over which particles are displaced (2. 1 mm) and the waiting time between two bioturbation events (5. 39 h). Accordingly, reworking is characterized by highly frequent and small-scale particle displacement, which makes that A. ovata can be classified as a true biodiffuser. ...|$|R
40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 1289 on 14. 03. 2017 by CS (TIS) The Vera Basin {{is used as}} a case study to examine the structural evolution and sedimentary response of a basin undergoing uplift and inversion during the Plio-Pleistocene. Particular emphasis is placed on the drainage evolution during that period. Located within the Internal zone of the Betic Cordilleras, the Vera Basin is defined within a large left-lateral shear zone and has evolved as a reponse to isostatic uplift from nappe emplacement during the Oligocene, and by regional compressive tectonics. Since basin formation during the Seravallian, sedimentary fill has been dominantly marine. During the Plio-Pleistocene a switch from marine to continental conditions occurred. These sediments (Cuevas, Espiritu Santo and Salmcr 6 n Formations) represent the final stages of basin fill and form the focus of this study. The Cuevas Formation represents an early Pliocene marine transgression within the Vera Basin. Early sedimentation infilled a pronounced submarine topography produced by a rapid laie Miocene fall in sca- level. A broad, shallow shelf platform area existed which opened out to the Pliocene Mediterranean Sea towards the east. Along the northern and western basin margins, wave dominated shorelines were formed. Structural activity was confined to low amounts of basin subsidence and limited left lateral strike-slip movement along the Palomares Fault Zone. The Espiritu Santo Formation marks a major palaeogcographic reorganisation and the final marine phases of the Vera Basin during the mid to late Pliocene. Unsteady strike-slip movement along the Palomarcs fault zone on the eastern basin margin partially enclosed the Vera Basin by northwards movement of a structurally detached landmass. Gilbert-type fan-delta bodies prograded westwards from the landmass (Sierra Almagrera), infilling the central region of the basin. Early fan-delta sediments were <b>reworked</b> into shoreline <b>areas</b> along the western and northern basin margins. Western margin shorelines retreated northwards as a response to partial enclosure and a gradual lowering of sea-level. Late stages of the Espiritu Santo Formation, saw a fan-delta body prograde from the northern basin margins. Interaction between the basinal and marginal fan-delta bodies enclosed the northern region of the Vera Basin. A swamp/mangrove environment developed within the enclosed northern basin area suggesting a humid, sub-tropical climntc. Continental conditions were established during Salmer 6 n Formation times in the late Pliocene. Along the western and northern basin margins, the retreating Pliocene shorelines provided a topography onto which the primary consequent drainage network developed. Three separate drainage systems can be identified on the basis of clast assemblages, palaeocurrents, depositional style and morphological expression. Early deposition was characterised by the progradation of alluvial fans of two drainage systems (Cuevas & Jauro), sourced from the northern and western basin margins. Distal areas of the northern fan system intercalated with an evaporitic playa lake. A third drainage system in the northwest of the basin (Salmeron) developed within a topographic low between the two fan systems. An increase in structural activity {{towards the end of the}} Salmeron Formation was characterised by a basin wide phase of north-south compression. Uplift and extensional faulting lead to abandonment of the primary drainage network. Fan entrenchment and minor rerouting of sediment supplies marked the establishment of a new secondary consequent drainage network during the Pleistocene. The Pleistocene drainage network records the progressive dissection of the Vera Basin as a response to ongoing regional epeirogenic uplift. During this post-inversion phase the Rios Antas, Almanzora and Aguas developed respectively along the western, northern and southern basin margins as a series of braided streams. Distal, coastal areas of this drainage network are recorded by a series of Pleistocene shoreline sequences which developed as a response to fluctuating sea-level during the Pleistocene glacial and inlerglacial periods. Early Pleistocene proximal parts of the drainage network are well preserved. Distal parts of the Pleistocene fluvial system display limited evidence for interaction between the drainage network and shoreline sequences. This lack of preservation relates to the high energy, wave dominated deposilional setting of the Pleistocene shoreline <b>areas</b> which <b>reworked</b> fluvial sediment inputs into the shoreline environment. The Plio-Pleistocene evolution of the Vera Basin, and in particular the development of the fluvial system during this period has been highly complex. Despite the importance of sea-level and climatic controls, tectonic activity during this period of basin inversion has been the dominant control on the positioning of the drainage networks, depositional styles and sediment supply...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is an ethnographic study carried out among farmers in Mupfurudzi resettlement area in Zimbabwe {{over a period}} of 30 months. The research was carried out in Shamva Zimbabwe as an offshoot of an IFPRI   study I had been involved in, accessing the impact of agricultural research on poverty reduction with a particular focus on High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) of Maize in Zimbabwe.   The multi-disciplinary study looked at the pathways of dissemination of knowledge about hybrid maize. As the study progressed and I was confronted with situations in the field, I decided that there was a need to go beyond this rather narrow angle of study to look at the production, growth and dissemination of knowledge about farming in general and not just focus on maize cultivation as a poverty reduction strategy. The main research question that informed this research was: how knowledge is produced, reproduced, socialised and <b>reworked</b> in farming <b>areas</b> and how locally existing conditions filter themselves into the new practices. Hence the research aimed to accomplish three aims: (1) to analyse how social processes impact on the adoption, adaptation and dissemination of knowledge and technology; (2) To investigate how differences between actors (e. g. based on age, gender, social and economic standing, institutional affiliation, and the knowledge networks used by various actors) can impact on knowledge dissemination and appropriation; (3) To explore existing knowledge frameworks affect knowledge analysis and acceptance and how people bridge the gap between 'outside' and 'local' forms of knowledge. The main research method employed in this study was the ethnographic method with a focus on case studies. The case studies were based on detailed observation of the families throughout the year. I spent thirty-months in the field, covering two agricultural cycles. The principal research technique was participant observation focusing on the collection of extended case studies and life histories In-depth interviews, observation and participation constituted the main data gathering process. During the early days I had in-depth discussions with various members of the households in the sample, depending on who was available at that moment. At times I had to make special requests to speak to other members of the household, such as women and children. Ethnographic interviews (which were largely unstructured and extensive) were also important for data gathering especially when looking at household dynamics in respect of the process of knowledge formation. The research led to different conclusions. Firstly the thing that came out clearly was that usually government ignores the interests of farmers in the interests of some abstract concept of development that they develop in research institutions. As a result farmers are recruited into projects they have little interests in and the projects fail. To be successful experts have to incorporate the farmers' views into their projects. Depending on where actors are socially situated they observe things and interpret them differently, such that the same thing can be attributed to different causal factors Rural development workers must not be overly scientific ignoring the different perceptions and meanings that people attach to activities and interventions, since this can spell the failure of scientifically sound projects. For intervention to be effective, AREX and other 'experts' should understand the people's belief systems and the meanings they attach to certain things. It also became clear that farmers strategise in their dealings with other actors and agents they do not follow blindly whatever the expert says and neither did they divorce themselves altogether from 'knowledge experts'. They employed various linking and de-linking strategies in an attempt to maximise their gains from each encounter. Power is always contested and negotiated. Local farmers are not always powerless and dependent and neither is the state always powerful and dominant. Although farmers recognised that the control of government they did not regard it as an entity that had to be obeyed all the time.   It is a conclusion of this study that knowledge is not always positive {{for the people who are}} equipped with it. Although modern scientific knowledge is very efficient, it has made farmers more dependent on agro-business as opposed to the independence they had enjoyed when all the resources were locally available. It was not only scientific knowledge that was disempowering to the farmer but even local knowledge also restricted farmers in certain ways. Farming knowledge is not only about the practice of farming but also about the knowledge of politics, resistance, economics, how to resolve conflicts and knowledge of witchcraft, magic and religion. An ability to tread the delicate ground between knowledge, politics and economics is an essential tool for the rural development worker otherwise his or her effectiveness is limited. The fragmentary and contradictory nature of knowledge allowed farmers to manoeuvre within their social system and to negotiate to their advantage. This allowed farmers to work with a multiplicity of understandings, beliefs and commitments enabling them to bridge the gap between external and local knowledge. It is sustained therefore in this study that one cannot distinguish between different forms of knowledge but knowledge should be regarded as an outcome of negotiations that take place between actors and their lifeworld...|$|R
