40|$|Dicathais orbita is a predatory marine whelk of {{interest}} {{as a new}} source of protein for potential production in <b>aquaculture.</b> <b>Establishment</b> of a successful aquaculture industry based on this species will require optimisation of their diet for fast growth and survival, whilst maintaining a good proximate composition in the flesh. Here we compare the effects of four diets fed to juvenile D. orbita over a 12 week period, to evaluate consumption, feed conversion, growth rates, mortalities and proximate composition. It was found that diet impacts significantly on the growth and survival rates of this whelk, with bivalve feeds resulting in significantly higher consumption (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and growth rates (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) compared to artificial pellets, despite similar feed conversion ratios (P = 0. 359). The artificial pellets were found to have significantly less moisture, but higher protein, glycogen and lipid content than the bivalve feeds (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and resulted in whelk flesh with significantly higher energy and ash content (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). D. orbita showed a preference for scavenging frozen bivalves over predation on live molluscs in captivity, which could reflect an optimal foraging strategy to minimise the energy required to subdue prey. Overall, juvenile D. orbita display similar growth (up to 0. 8 g/month) and high survival (3 ̆e 90...|$|R
40|$|The oceans {{are faced}} with a rapidly intensifying challenge: the demand for fish is growing and global {{fisheries}} catches have plateaued. Scientists and industry experts are looking towards aquaculture, also known as fish farming, {{to bridge the gap between}} the quantity of wild-caught seafood that we can sustainably harvest from the ocean and the average person’s desire to eat healthy, inexpensive, ecologically-friendly seafood. On the surface, aquaculture provides one of the most attractive alternatives to potentially unsustainable fishing practices because it is a net producer of protein with an average feed conversion ratio of 1 : 2; using approximately one ton of wild, whole, fish to produce two tons of seafood (NOAA 2013). 1 This high feed conversion ratio makes aquaculture quite profitable when managed correctly and in fact, the number of <b>registered</b> <b>aquaculture</b> operations in the world has been doubling every 3 years since the early 1980 ’s (FAO 2011). The majority of these farms are feeding their fish with expensive, protein-rich, feed. The primary ingredient in these feeds is fishmeal made from low trophic level species, like anchoveta or sardines (NOAA 2013). Currently, global fishmeal production is approximately 5 billion metric tons which in turn requires the direct harvest of 16. 5 million tons of fish per year (IFFO 2009). Harvesting such a large proportion of select fish populations is negatively impacting marine foodwebs. In at least one recent study, scientists insisted that th...|$|R
40|$|Pharmaceuticals are {{considered}} as emerging pollutants {{of particular concern}} due to their continuous release into {{the environment and the}} potential impact on aquatic organisms. The selection of the target compounds for evaluation in fish tissue was based on physico-chemical properties, bioaccumulation potential and the results of the screening of pharmaceuticals in the effluent of WWTP Sevnica in March 2015. We chose tramadol, risperidone, desipramine, carbamazepine, irbesartan, naproxen, valsartan, atorvastatin, triclosan, simvastatin and diclofenac. The method was developed on muscle tissue and is based on the tissue homogenization with stainless steel beads, followed by extraction with acetonitrile, centrifugation and sample clean-up with solid-phase extraction (SPE). The instrumental analysis was performed with LC-MS/MS. The best and the most reproducible recoveries were observed for the samples that were diluted to 25 mL with 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 7. The method was validated and the linearity range was established, which was in the range of 0. 1 – 1000 ng/g, depending of the compound. The recoveries for the target pharmaceuticals were in the range of 24. 0 – 108. 5 %, with good reproducibility as the relative RSD values for all compounds were below 7. 5 %. LOQ values for the compounds were in the 0. 1 – 50 ng/g range. We applied the method to the fish tissue samples from the river Sava and from the <b>aquaculture</b> <b>establishment.</b> We chose muscle, liver, skin and kidney tissue samples. The results showed presence of tramadol and carbamazepine in some tissue, but the concentrations were below the LOQ...|$|R
40|$|Aquaculture {{production}} has notably {{increased in the}} last decades, mainly thanks to intensive farming. Together with market globalization, this {{gives rise to the}} spreading of several fish diseases, thus increasing the demand for veterinary drugs for aquatic species. Nonetheless, very few chemicals are registered for use in aquaculture, and fish farmers are often forced to resort to off-label use of drugs authorized for other food-producing animal species. Rainbow trout is the major farmed fish species in Italy and the second one in Europe. Erythromycin is the antibiotic of choice against gram-positive cocci, the major concern for trout farming, but it is not yet <b>registered</b> for <b>aquaculture</b> use in most European countries. The aim {{of this study was to}} follow the depletion of erythromycin in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), after its administration at 100 mg kg− 1 trout body weight day− 1 for 21 days through medicated feed (water temperature, 11. 5 °C). Erythromycin residues in fish muscle plus skin in natural proportion were determined by a validated liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method. Interpolation of our data, following European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products guidelines, gives a withdrawal time of 255 °C-days (°C-day = water temperature × days), thus showing that the general value (500 °C-day) recommended by the Council Directive (EEC) no. 82 / 2001 for off-label drug use in aquaculture would be too conservative in this case, with excessive costs for the farmers. Our study provides preliminary data for a more prudent use of erythromycin in rainbow trout, suggesting a possible withdrawal time after treatment...|$|R
40|$|The farming of {{penaeid shrimps}} in Cambodia began in 1989 and has {{significantly}} expanded since 1991. Shrimp cultivation {{has been carried}} out in the four coastal provinces, i. e. Kampot, Kep, Preah Sihanouk Ville, and Koh Kong. Black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon) and whiteleg shrimp (P. vannamei) are the main species being cultured extensively and intensively in brackishwater ponds in Kampot, Kep, and Preah Sihanouk Ville, and Koh Kong, respectively. Extensive shrimp ponds were constructed close to the mangrove areas with some containing mangroves within the pond and stocking density ranging from 5, 000 to 20, 000 postlarvae/ha. However, the productivity remains low at > 100 kg/ ha/ year. On the contrary, intensive culture has a stocking density ranging from 300, 000 to 500, 000 postlarvae/ha. While high cost of investment for farm establishment, pond construction and farm operation are required, productions of newly established farms have reached 7 to 8 metric tons (MT) /ha per crop. The occurrence of white spot disease, monodon baculovirus disease, and yellow head disease was first reported in 1999 among cultured P. monodon in Koh Kong province causing a number of farmers to stop the intensive cultivation of black tiger shrimp. To date, only a small proportion of shrimp farmers have ventured into extensive shrimp farming with approximately 10 ha of shrimp areas currently in operation. To mitigate the negative impacts of shrimp diseases and promote the expansion of the shrimp industry in Cambodia, development of a national reporting system for aquatic animal diseases; capacity building for detection, monitoring and disease surveillance; creation of National Guidelines On Good Shrimp <b>Aquaculture</b> Practices; <b>establishment</b> of subresearch centers and concomitant funding support for marine aquaculture development and extension services; establishment of local shrimp hatcheries and provision of hands-on trainings for farmers; and strengthening collaborations among provincial officers, researchers and farmers network should be accordingly instituted...|$|R
40|$|The high {{mortality}} during fish {{early life}} stages {{is a major}} bottleneck in <b>aquaculture.</b> Therefore, the <b>establishment</b> of methods to prevent and control diseases, to ensure efficient growth and to reach maximal survival rates is mandatory to optimize the productivity. A promising solution can be the early activation {{of the immune system}} by administration of probiotics as nutritional supplements. In our study we assess the effect of the probiotic candidate Bacillus subtilis on the innate and adaptive immune response of juvenile European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax). Therefore, Artemia nauplii were used as live carriers to feed B. subtilis to 3 -month-old sea bass over a period of 2 weeks. Subsequently, the juveniles were fed another week without administering B. subtilis in order to estimate the bacterial mucus-binding ability. During the course of the experiment, we evaluated direct effects on the cellular immune response by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and on survival. As a next step we will determine profiles of immune gene expression. To estimate cellular stress, the expression level of metabolism- and stress-related genes will be measured. Furthermore, the RNA/DNA ratio as an indicator of growth will be analysed...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} novel {{experimental}} technique to investigate the effect of sound on the behavior of various cultured species of fish, at first, and subsequently to demonstrate the usefulness of this effect. Three species are investigated: gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata), seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax), and red porgy (Pagrus pagrus). A digital imaging system was developed to monitor fish position in 2 dimensions as a function of time. The system includes 2 dedicated software packages for the storage and analysis of the data directly on a laptop and can be connected to a sound production system including a sound generator, an amplifier and a water-proof loudspeaker set in the water. Altogether, these constitute a portable, water-proof, easily-used instrument {{for the study of the}} effect of sound on fish behavior, and it was successfully tested in a small tank, large tank, sea cage, and in the field. The contrast of the image can be adjusted according to lighting conditions. The data-collection software records the positions of the fish as a function of time (every 1 / 15 of a second). The instrument can also operate with a portable, rechargeable battery. The experiments were conducted in a) a small tank (110 l) with 2 populations of S. aurata (gilthead seabream) weighing 5. 2 g and 12. 0 g respectively, 1 population of D. labrax (seabass) (~ 1. 6 g) and 1 population of P. pagrus (red porgy) (~ 1. 7 g) b) a large tank (10 m 3) with a population of S. aurata (~ 250 g) c) in a sea cage of an <b>aquaculture</b> <b>establishment</b> with a population of S. aurata (~ 150 g), and d) the Amvrakikos gulf (Menidi) after the release of the population of S. aurata being in the sea cage. The method of the conditioned response was applied, whereby the new stimulus, the sound, is followed by a reward: feeding. In the small tank, experiments were conducted at 6 different frequencies (100, 200, 500, 800, 1250, and 2500 Hz), and additionally also at 5000 Hz for the gilthead seabream, and at 5 levels of sound (- 62, - 42, - 32, - 20 και - 10 dBu). In the large tank, experiments were conducted with 3 different frequencies (200, 500, and 800 Hz), and at 1 level of sound (- 20 dBu), but also using sound with the timbre from 4 different groups of instruments: strings, woodwind, percussion, and electric instruments. In the sea cage, experiments were conducted with 5 different frequencies (100, 200, 500, 800, and 1250 Hz) and at 1 level of sound (- 10 dBu), whereas in the gulf 3 frequencies were used (100, 200, and 500 Hz) at - 10 dBu. The response to the sound was judged by the location of the fish with respect to the sound source before, during, and after production of sound. A positive response was observed for all three species of fish and in all developmental stages studied. The aggregation of the fish at the point of feeding is judged as a positive response. In the experimental setup used for most measurements, the feeding point and the sound source were located closely to each other. However, when the sound source was moved to other locations within the tank, the gilthead seabream located it both optically and by sound (during operation). A positive response was obtained more often when the feeding was accompanied or immediately followed by the sound and in that case a sound burst lasting 15 - 30 s was ideal. We determine that D. labrax and S. aurata are “hearing generalists” (non-specialists), that is they respond positively at low frequencies until 800 Hz. P. pagrus responded positively only at 500 Ηz. The responses are independent of the sound levels in the small tank. In the large tank we chose to use our loudest setting only. Sounds from musical instruments produce a positive response on fish which have been previously conditioned at a single frequency. However, fish did not respond, when music was played in the air (not transmitted with the underwater loudspeaker). The response to the sound is affected by abiotic factors (especially in the field), but not by the time of day. The change in behavior caused by the application of the sound pulses in the small tank appears between the 2 nd and the 4 th day of the experiments, with a progressive improvement of the response as long as the conditioning is going on. For the gilthead seabeam positive responses can be observed even after 1 month without any stimulation. The change in behavior caused by sound stimulus in the large tank appears on the 4 th day of the experiment and is not affected by the change to the other two frequencies tested. In the sea cage a weak response was observed on the 3 rd day, which, however, was not repeated on subsequent days, likely due to the abiotic factors. [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScAquaculture {{is a vast}} {{industry}} {{all over}} the world and has increased significantly during the past 30 years. In South Africa, finfish aquaculture farms stretch from Gansbaai to as far as Richards bay with the potential of extending into Mozambique. The future success of this fast growing industry in South Africa strongly relies on the development of the supporting sector such as government legislation, sponsorship, participation of the pharmaceutical industry and research and development in aquatic organism health management. Diplectanum oliveri Williams, 1989, a monogenean gill parasite of both Argyrosomus japonicus (Temminck & Schlegel, 1843) (dusky kob) and A. inodorus Griffiths & Heemstra, 1995 (silver kob) is currently regarded in South Africa as the most persistent ectoparasite associated with the culture of both fish species, causing pathological tissue changes in the areas associated with attachment and feeding which can result in stock losses. The egg production of D. oliveri was used to evaluate and develop a method to quantify monogenean infections on fish, by counting the eggs produced by infra-populations of these parasites over a 24 -hour period and to determine the reliability of this method as a non-invasive/non-destructive method to quantify the intensity of an individual infra-population of parasites on a single host. Currently, Diplectanum spp. on dusky kob are being controlled in local mariculture facilities using methods and drugs that are traditionally used for monogeneans (flukes) and are regarded as effective. Most of these drugs are, however, no longer approved for use in food fish and none of them has proven to be very effective in controlling D. oliveri in culture facilities, which can result in subsequent re-infections of epidemic proportion. Currently, there are no anthelmintics <b>registered</b> for <b>aquaculture</b> in South Africa. An registered anthelmintic used in terrestrial animals (sheep, goats, cattle and ostriches) containing praziquantel was tested at various concentrations and exposures against D. oliveri on A. japonicus to determine the efficacy of two different formulations and the potential for "off label" use. The 20 ppm (high) praziquantel concentration treatments eliminated all adult parasites, but caused significant measureable stress and affected the central nervous system of the fish, which resulted in death of all fish in the solution group after 18 hours. The 2 ppm (low) concentrations failed to remove all adult parasites. Although both the 2 hour (short) exposure/high concentration and 24 hour (long) exposure/low concentration of the suspension formulation were effective, but only the short exposure/high concentration eliminated all adult parasites with little change in behaviour by the treated fish...|$|R
