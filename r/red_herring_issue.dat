40|$|Are we too many? Few {{questions}} have sparked such heated debate in environmental political thought. It {{is a question}} that highlights fundamental tensions between humans and the environment, or people and resources. It stems from a belief that there is imbalance in the natural order and a profound sense of fear for the future of life on earth. It is a politically-charged ‘can of worms ’ that gets opened up at particular times of crisis, such as the food riots of the late 18 th century, the oil shocks of the 1970 s and most recently with the grim predictions of climate change. It {{is a question that}} is often met with scepticism (and worse) from those who think it is a <b>red</b> <b>herring</b> <b>issue</b> that is at odds with principles of social justice and human rights. A growing number of environmentalists have recently argued that the progressive left is wrong to put concerns about human rights ahead of the urgent need to address ecological problems of serious global proportions. No matter which side of the debate one identifies with, it is important to accept that ‘are we too many? ’ is neither a straightforward scientific nor politically innocent question. It is loaded with assumptions and value judgements and is part of a discourse that does a very particular job of ideological work. As such, it ought to be unpacked carefully and examined critically. I suggest that looking at the assumptions, values and motives behind the question can tell us more about the issu...|$|E

5000|$|A <b>red</b> <b>herring</b> {{prospectus}} is <b>issued</b> {{to potential}} investors, {{but does not}} have complete particulars {{on the price of}} the securities offered and quantum of securities to be issued. The front page of the prospectus displays a bold red disclaimer stating that information in the prospectus is not complete and may be changed, and that the securities may not be sold until the registration statement, filed with the market regulator, is effective. Potential investors may not place buy orders for the security, based solely on the information contained within the preliminary prospectus. Those investors may, however, express an [...] "indication of interest" [...] in the offering, provided that they have received a copy of the <b>red</b> <b>herring</b> at least 48 hours prior to the public sale. After the registration statement becomes effective, and the stock is offered to the public, indications of interest may be converted to purchase orders, at the buyer's discretion. The final prospectus must then be promptly delivered to the buyer.|$|R
40|$|The spectre of low-cost, {{real-time}} {{voice communication}} over the Internet has polarised Internet service providers and telephone network operators, {{at the expense}} of finding solutions to the problem of integrating communications services (in particular, existing wireless and wireline telephony) with WWW content services. This paper argues that such solutions not only exist and appear to be commercially viable, but could bring about a transformation of the WWW as a tool for business and personal communications. 2. 0 Introduction A <b>red</b> <b>herring</b> is an <b>issue</b> which appears to be important and distracts a discussion or debate away from the original topic. It derives from the practice of using a strong-smelling smoked herring (or kipper) to distract hounds from their prey. There are approximately 500 million telephones in the world. The {{increase in the number of}} new mobile telephony subscribers alone in the past few years has matched the growth in Internet users, and in gross numbers and socia [...] ...|$|R

5000|$|Although Cobbett popularized {{the figurative}} usage, {{he was not}} the first to {{consider}} <b>red</b> <b>herring</b> for scenting hounds in a literal sense; an earlier reference occurs in the pamphlet Nashe's Lenten Stuffe, published in 1599 by the Elizabethan writer Thomas Nashe, in which he says [...] "Next, to draw on hounds to a scent, to a <b>red</b> <b>herring</b> skin there is nothing comparable." [...] The Oxford English Dictionary makes no connection with Nashe's quote and the figurative meaning of <b>red</b> <b>herring</b> to distract from the intended target, only in the literal sense of a hunting practice to draw dogs towards a scent.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>red</b> <b>herring</b> {{is a false}} clue {{intended}} to lead investigators toward an incorrect solution. This device usually appears in detective novels and mystery fiction. The <b>red</b> <b>herring</b> {{is a type of}} , a device {{intended to}} distract the protagonist, and by extension the reader, away from the correct answer or from the site of pertinent clues or action. The Indian murder mystery film Gupt: The Hidden Truth cast many veteran actors who had usually played villainous roles in previous Indian films as <b>red</b> <b>herrings</b> in this film to deceive the audience into suspecting them. In the bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code, the misdeeds of a key character named [...] "Bishop Aringarosa" [...] draw attention away from the true master villain ("Aringarosa" [...] literally translates as [...] "pink herring"). Agatha Christie's classic And Then There Were None is another famous example and includes the term as well in a murder ploy where the intended victims are made to guess that one of them will be killed through an act of treachery. A <b>red</b> <b>herring</b> can also be used as a form of false foreshadowing.|$|R

The warning states that the offering information is incomplete, and may be changed.

Brokers can, however, take indications of interest from their clients. At {{the time of the}} stock launch, after the Registration Statement has become effective, indications of interest can be converted to buy orders, at the discretion of the buyer. Sales can only be made through a final prospectus cleared by the Securities and Exchange Commission.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} using herring for distracting hounds is {{an article published}} on 14 February 1807 by radical journalist William Cobbett in his polemical periodical Political Register. According to Cohen and Ross, and accepted by the OED, this is {{the origin of the}} figurative meaning of <b>red</b> <b>herring.</b> In the piece, William Cobbett critiques the English press, which had mistakenly reported Napoleon's defeat. Cobbett recounted that he had once used a <b>red</b> <b>herring</b> to deflect hounds in pursuit of a hare, adding [...] "It was a mere transitory effect of the political red-herring; for, on the Saturday, the scent became as cold as a stone." [...] Quinion concludes: [...] "This story, and Cobbett's extended repetition of it in 1833, was enough to get the figurative sense of <b>red</b> <b>herring</b> into the minds of his readers, unfortunately also with the false idea that it came from some real practice of huntsmen." ...|$|R
