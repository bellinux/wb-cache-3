40|$|The {{practical}} use of forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> and rice is encouraged because {{it contributes to}} the effective utilization of paddy fields and production {{as well as the}} use of domestic feed. Research on forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> and rice has typically focused on the perspective of paddy or livestock farmers. However, {{to address the issue of}} the {{practical use}} of forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> and rice, the maintenance of users is necessary, and this demands the existence and cooperation of both paddy and livestock farmers. In this study, an interview survey was conducted to clarify the logic of paddy and livestock farmers who introduce forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> and rice as well as determine the importance of intermediation companies for <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> farmers. We find that paddy farmers plant forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> and <b>rice</b> to keep <b>paddy</b> fields because they have to deal with adjustments to long-term production and the expansion of areas dedicated to changing crop. Meanwhile, livestock farmers use forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> to produce coarse feed. Hence, the management strategy of individual farmers is related to the logic of introducing forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice.</b> Further, we show that intermediation companies aim to keep the high quality of forage <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> and <b>rice</b> by monitoring <b>paddy</b> farmers and managing supply and demand. This is important to decrease the gap between paddy and livestock farmers based on both logics. In particular, the monitoring and adjustment of supply and demand play a major role, and thus it is necessary for intermediation companies to improve these functions in the future...|$|R

Results indicated that nitrate uptake by rice seedlings and ammonium effects were related to transmembrane potential difference, and upland <b>rice</b> and <b>paddy</b> <b>rice</b> presented obviously different responses. Nitrate induced a rapid depolarization and then a slow repolarization of transmembrane potential in root epidermal cells, and even hyperpolarization was observed when nitrate concentration was low.

Depolarization of membrane potential was amplified when ammonium was simultaneously added with nitrate into the measure medium, but repolarization was reduced, even disappeared. Brazilian upland rice seedlings had high Vmax of nitrate uptake and low Km, furthermore, Vmax and Km were little affected by ammonium, but Vmax of Wuyujing 3 was reduced significantly. Therefore, inhibition of ammonium to nitrate uptake possibly due to decrease of membrane potential and influence of nitrate transporters.

40|$|It {{is clear}} that a canopy {{architecture}} affects the CO_ 2 diffusion in a foliage. The CO_ 2 diffusion coefficient is expressed by D = U・i・l_m where D is diffusion coefficient, U is wind speed, i is relative turbulence intensity and I, is mixing length. In this paper we show the relation of canopy architecture with attenuation coefficient (β) of wind speed (U) in the canopy and drag coefficient (C_d) {{as one of the}} construction factors of β. The results are summarized as follows; From the profiles of the wind speed above and within the canopies of barnyard millet, upland <b>rice,</b> <b>paddy</b> <b>rice,</b> wheat, soybean and short and tall types of grain sorghum, the attenuation coefficients (β) of wind speed and drag coefficients (C_d) of leaves in these canopies were obtained. The β obtained from the wind profile in the canopy can be expressed as β ∝ F_L・C_d where F_L is leaf area index. Though C_d of the horizontal foliage was smaller than that of vertical foliage, β of the soybean canopy was larger than paddy and upland rice vertical foliages compared on the same F_L. This resulted from the soybean canopy having large leaf area density (LAD) in upper layers of the foliage. The β of the tall type of grain sorghum was smaller than that of the short type. This resulted from the small C_d of the tall grain sorghum canopy. As mentioned above, {{it was found that the}} attenuation coefficient (β) of wind speed was affected by not only leaf inclination but also vertical distribution of leaf area and canopy height. 群落構造はC 0 _ 2 拡散に強く関係している. 群落内のC 0 _ 2 拡散係数は風速,相対乱流強度および混合距離の積で表わされる. 拡散係数はこれらのうち風速に特に支配される傾向が強い. 本報では群落構造と風速の減衰係数,およびその構成要素の一つである抵抗係数との関係を調べた. 1) 栽培ヒエ,陸稲,小麦,大豆,グレインソルガムの短稈系統と長稈系統および水稲個体群について,風速の観測を行い,風速の減衰係数および葉身の風に対する抵抗係数を求めた. 2) 高さ方向に対する風速分布から求めた減衰係数βは葉面積指数と対抗係数の積で表わされた. 減衰係数は葉面積密度が植被の上層で高い大豆で大きく,植被の下層で高い陸稲が小さかった. 草高が等しく,葉面積密度の垂直分布が紡垂型をしている個体群(グレインソルガムの短稈系統,水稲) では,両者の中間であった. 3) 積算葉面積に対する風速分布から求めた減衰係数β 2 ̆ 7 は大豆個体群で小さく,陸稲及び水稲個体群で大きかった. グレインソルガムの長稈系統でもβ 2 ̆ 7 は小さい傾向があった. 4) 減衰係数β 2 ̆ 7 は抵抗係数と関係しており,大豆とグレインソルガムの長稈系統の個体群において抵抗係数は小さかった. 5) 以上の結果から,葉面積密度と抵抗係数の小さいグレインソルガムの長稈系統の個体群においてCO_ 2 拡散係数が大きいことが示唆された...|$|E

Rice starch granules and kernel characteristics were altered significantly during steeping and changes in isolated starch differed from those inside the rice kernels. To study the changes during the steaming process, the morphology of the rice kernel and starch granules within the kernel were examined immediately after heating at 110 oC for 20 min. Starch was completely gelatinized as determined by DSC and XRD, indicating the disruption of all short-range crystallinity of starch in parboiled rice. However, SEM showed intact starch granules and light microscopic images showed starch granules embedded in the rice kernel. Interestingly, these granules displayed Maltese cross patterns.
