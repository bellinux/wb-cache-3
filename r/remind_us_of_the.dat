50|$|Published by Durieux in 2013 {{her novel}} X with themes ranging from love, over {{symbolism}} {{in art and}} in nature, through the friction a woman artist is often facing in contemporary society. Art critic Nađa Bobičić nevertheless <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> struggle towards the end, {{at which point the}} reader is awarded with an ending devoid of naivete, one which is full of optimism, one which <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycles <b>of</b> creation and renewal.|$|R
500|$|The [...] lament [...] "Rheingold! Rheingold! Reines Gold!..." [...] (Das Rheingold Scene 4) is sung by the maidens {{at the end}} of Das Rheingold, as {{the gods}} begin to cross the Rainbow Bridge into Valhalla. It begins with the music from the greeting, but {{develops}} into what Ernest Newman describes as a [...] "haunting song of loss", which becomes increasingly poignant before it is drowned by the orchestral fortissimo [...] that ends the opera. [...] A slow version of the lament is played on the horns in Siegfried, Act 2, as Siegfried enters Fafner's cave to claim the gold—the lament, says Cooke, serves to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gold's true ownership. The lament is played spiritedly during the Götterdämmerung prologue, as part of the orchestral interlude known as Siegfried's Rhine Journey, [...] before a shadow falls across the music as it descends into the minor key of the [...] "servitude" [...] motive.|$|E

2500|$|We {{have now}} {{reached the point}} where the old city, which had grown up haphazard, with crooked streets, wooded hills, and fertile valleys traversed by streams and winding country roads, begins to be absorbed into a new city, in which antiquity and mature are no longer respected, with streets laid out in {{accordance}} with a carefully considered symmetrical plan. ... Unfortunately, this plan, although possessing the merits of simplicity and directness, lacked entirely the equally essential elements of variety of picturesqueness, which demand a large degree of respect for the natural conformation of the land. The new plan was entirely deficient in sentiment and charm, and with its gradual development, little by little, the individuality, the interest, and the beauty of one choice spot after another have been swept away [...] scarcely anything remains to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primitive beauty and the fascinating diversity of natural charms we know Manhattan once possessed. The year 1811 marks the end of the little old city {{and the beginning of the}} great modern metropolis.|$|E

6000|$|... [15] How {{does this}} <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> awfully {{impressive}} {{cries of the}} man in the iron cage--'O, eternity, eternity! how shall I grapple with the misery that I must meet with in eternity!' 'A thousand deaths live in him, he not dead.'--Ed.|$|E

60|$|He walked round my statue, and had {{the design}} {{explained}} to him. I had represented Muskegon as a young, almost a stripling mother, with something of an Indian type; the babe upon her knees was winged, to indicate our soaring future; and her seat was a medley of sculptured fragments, Greek, Roman, and Gothic, to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older worlds from which we trace our generation.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the least}} known of these minor poets, Thomas Beddoes, was gifted {{in a way to}} <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strange genius of Blake. He wrote not much, his life being too broken and disappointed; but running through his scanty verse is a thread of the pure gold of poetry.

50|$|Diels Barceloner Parmäne, Diels große englische Renette and Diels Renette were {{well-known}} apple varieties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th Century. <b>The</b> Dietzer Goldrenette <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> place <b>of</b> his work.|$|R

60|$|Such {{stories as}} this of “The Enigma” <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{pictures}} clever children sometimes draw “out {{of their own}} head,” where {{you will see a}} modern villa on the right, two knights in helmets fighting in the foreground, and a tiger grinning in a jungle on the left, the several objects being brought together because the artist thinks each pretty, and perhaps still more because he remembers seeing them in other pictures.|$|E
6000|$|Doubtless {{there were}} several critics of that period, who held the heretical opinion above {{expressed}} by Lee. And the imitation was such as to warrant that conclusion, considering the school {{in which it was}} formed. The scene of the consultation in Pandemonium, and of the soliloquy of Satan on his arrival in the newly-created universe, would possess great merit, did they not unfortunately <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> majestic simplicity of Milton. But there is often a sort of Ovidian point in the diction which seems misplaced. Thus, Asmodeus tells us, that the devils, ascending from the lake of fire, ...|$|E

A disease in the body sometimes brings out scars. A doctor doesn't stare at the scars. He treats the body for the disease. Get these places out of your mind, Julia.

50|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{as suggested}} by Dr. Ramachandra C. Dhere in his book entitled, Lajja Gauri is that Lanja/Lanjika means 'naked', <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geographical area in Konkan (Maharashtra), called Lanja.|$|R
50|$|As for pears Diels Butterbirne <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great breeder (cf. Liste der Birnensorten). With the Balduinsteiner Kinderbirne, now lost, Diel also immortalized that Diez {{belongs to}} <b>the</b> neighborhoods <b>of</b> Balduinstein.|$|R
50|$|Thus, when we recite or recount number 108, we are {{actually}} remembering the entire universe. This <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that the universal self is omnipresent, that is <b>the</b> innate nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> self.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We hope to {{have time}} to see {{something}} of the heathen population, though the London Mission Society having re-occupied the island, we do not regularly visit it with the intention of establishing ourselves.... The language is confined to that island. I call it language, not dialect, for it is, I believe, really distinct from any others we have or have heard of, very soft, like Italian, and capable of expressing accurately minute shades of meaning. Causative forms, &c., <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> oriental structure, one peculiarity (that of the chief's dialect, or almost language, running parallel to that of common life) I think I have before mentioned.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, {{there is}} this value about the colour that men call colourless; that it {{suggests}} in some way the mixed and troubled average of existence, especially in its quality of strife and expectation and promise. Grey is a colour that always seems {{on the eve of}} changing to some other colour; of brightening into blue or blanching into white or bursting into green and gold. So we may be perpetually reminded of the indefinite hope that is in doubt itself; and when there is grey weather in our hills or grey hairs in our heads, perhaps they may still <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> morning.|$|E
60|$|The idea of {{the story}} is {{extremely}} powerful, and Venetia Victrix is certainly the best poem in the volume--better than Ophelion, which is vague, and than A Friar's Story, which is pretty but ordinary. It shows that we have in Miss Fitz Gerald a new singer of considerable ability and vigour of mind, and it serves to <b>remind</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> splendid dramatic possibilities extant in life, which are ready for poetry, and unsuitable for the stage. What is really dramatic is not necessarily that which is fitting for presentation in a theatre. The theatre is an accident of the dramatic form. It is not essential to it. We have been deluded by the name of action. To think is to act.|$|E
5000|$|Norheim {{has written}} that “Norway will and should be a secular state” but added that “this does not mean we are also obliged to clear away {{everything}} that <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more than thousand-year-old Christian heritage.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Ludger Lütkehaus of Die Zeit {{wrote that}} the book {{sometimes}} borders on kitsch, but [...] "also <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fact that great literature often emerges when the border to kitsch is avoided only by a hair's breadth".|$|R
50|$|Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{extraordinary}} length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building - which <b>reminds</b> <b>us</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> speicher in Bremen - {{the design}} included two main stairs leading to the higher floors seven elevators, eight lifts and two internal hatchways connected with the cellar.|$|R
