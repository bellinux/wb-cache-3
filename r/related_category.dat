A goal of the article {{is to create an}} integral conception which can disclose a modification and transformation of these units, to understand the difference between <b>related</b> <b>categories.</b> An object of the article is to describe theoretical issues which arise while studying eptonyms and related to them derivative categories well-known by the linguists. Such category as «eptonyms» is well studied in Ukrainian, but worth studying in English. It is not still regarded as an independent object of research and any theoretical work has not been found. Thus, such research will help in further studying of <b>related</b> <b>categories</b> and, moreover, help to avoid ambiguity. Grounding of advisability for introducing such a category as «eptonyms» into English is also considered and can become an innovation for Anglo-Saxon linguistics...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we design}} a {{recommender}} {{system for the}} post-purchase stage, i. e., after a user purchases a product. Our method combines both behavioral and content aspects of recommendations. We first find the most <b>related</b> <b>categories</b> for the active product in the post-purchase stage. Among these <b>related</b> <b>categories,</b> products with high behavioral rel-evance and content relevance are recommended to the user. In addition, our algorithm considers the temporal factor, i. e., the purchase time of the active product and the rec-ommendation time. We apply our algorithm on {{a random sample of}} the purchase data from eBay. Comparing to the baseline item-based collaborative filtering approach, our hy-brid recommender system achieves significant coverage and purchase rate gain for different time windows...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. SearchSleuth is {{a program}} {{developed}} to experiment with the automated local analysis of Web search using formal concept analysis. SearchSleuth extends a standard search interface to include a conceptual neighborhood centered on a formal concept derived from the initial query. This neighborhood of the concept derived from the search terms is decorated with its upper and lower neighbors representing more general and specialized concepts respectively. In SearchSleuth, the notion of <b>related</b> <b>categories</b> – which are themselves formal concepts – is also introduced. This allows the retrieval focus to shift to a new formal concept called a sibling. This movement across the concept lattice needs to relate one formal concept to another in a principled way. This paper presents the issues concerning exploring and ordering the space of <b>related</b> <b>categories.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|An ideal image {{classifier}} {{should be}} able to exploit complex high dimensional feature representations even when only a few labeled examples are available for training. To achieve this goal we develop transfer learning algorithms that: 1) Leverage unlabeled data annotated with meta-data and 2) Exploit labeled data from <b>related</b> <b>categories.</b> In {{the first part of this}} thesis we show how to use the structure learning framework (Ando and Zhang, 2005) to learn efficient image representations from unlabeled images annotated with meta-data. In the second part we present a joint sparsity transfer algorithm for image classification. Our algorithm is based on the observation that <b>related</b> <b>categories</b> might be learnable using only a small subset of shared relevant features. To find these features we propose to train classifiers jointly with a shared regularization penalty that minimizes the total number of features involved in the approximation...|$|R
