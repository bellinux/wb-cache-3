5|$|During the menstrual {{period of}} the older queen, Ambika, Satyavati invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber.

Vyasa declared to Satyavti that due to Ambika's cruelty, her son would be blind (but strong) and have a hundred sons – later known as Kauravas (descendants of Kuru). Satyavati considered such an heir to be an unworthy king, so she asked Vyasa to have niyoga with her other daughter-in-law. During their niyoga, Ambalika fell pale due to Vyasa's grim appearance. As the result the child would be wan, Vyasa told his mother, who begged for another child. In due course, the blind Dhritarashtra and the pale Pandu were born. Satyavati again invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber; she remembered Vyasa's grim appearance (and <b>repulsive</b> <b>odour),</b> and substituted a Shudra (lowest caste) maid in her place. The maid respected the sage and was not afraid of him, and Vyasa thus blessed her; her son {{would be the most}} intelligent man, and she would no longer be a slave. Vyasa told Satyavti of the deception, and then disappeared; Vidura, an incarnation of the god Dharma, was born to the maid.|$|E

60|$|The gauchos of the pampas, however, give {{a reason}} for the {{powerful}} smell of the male deer; and, after some hesitation, I have determined to set it down here, for the reader to accept or reject, as he thinks proper. I neither believe nor disbelieve it; for although I do not put great faith in gaucho natural history, my own observations have not infrequently confirmed statements of theirs, which a sceptical person would have regarded as wild indeed. To give one instance: I heard a gaucho relate that while out riding he had been pursued for a considerable distance by a large spider; his hearers laughed at him for a romancer; but as I myself had been attacked and pursued, both when on foot and on horseback, by a large wolf-spider, common on the pampas, I did not join in the laugh. They say that the effluvium of C. campestris is abhorrent to snakes of all kinds, just as pyrethrum powder is to most insects, and even {{go so far as to}} describe its effect as fatal to them; according to this, the smell is therefore a protection to the deer. In places where venomous snakes are extremely abundant, as in the Sierra district on the southern pampas of Buenos Ayres, the gaucho frequently ties a strip of the male deer's skin, which retains its powerful odour for an indefinite time, round the neck of a valuable horse as a protection. It is certain that domestic animals are frequently lost here through snake-bites. The most common poisonous species--the Craspedo-cephalus alternatus, called Vivora de la Cruz in the vernacular--has neither bright colour nor warning rattle to keep off heavy hoofs, and is moreover of so sluggish a temperament that it will allow itself to be trodden on before stirring, with the result that its fangs are not infrequently struck into the nose or foot of browsing beast. Considering, then, the conditions in which C. campestris is placed--and it might also be supposed that venomous snakes have in past times been much more numerous than they are now--it is not impossible to believe that the powerful smell it emits has been made protective, especially when we see in other species how <b>repulsive</b> <b>odours</b> have been turned to account by the principle of natural selection.|$|R
5000|$|In Science of Survival, Hubbard {{discusses}} {{the correlation between}} body odor, bodily substances, and one's position on the emotional tone scale: The body is normally sweet-smelling down to 2.0 but begins to exude chronically certain unpleasant effluvia from 2.0 down. Individuals from 2.0 down commonly have bad breath. Their feet may have a considerable odour. The musk glands are very active. The sweat has a peculiar smell. Sexual organs emit a repelling odour. And various body exhaust functions are not under very good control. The person may have to urinate or defecate under slight stresses or may weep easily for no apparent cause. This column has not been added to this chart because {{it has not been}} thoroughly explored but is only known in a general way. Any slightly or greatly <b>repulsive</b> physical <b>odour</b> from an individual does, however, indicate a tone scale position below 2.0. It is amusing to note that in the Orient wives are commonly selected by the sweetness of their perspiration. This is a very reliable test for position on the tone scale. People who have bad breath as they are processed lose it when they are above 2.0 on the tone scale. People who are temporarily suppressed below 2.0 commonly have bad breath. Page 146 ...|$|R

A laboratory study showed that, in conditions where the sediment was frequently stirred up, sponges on empty scallop shells all died while those on living shells flourished. However, another study showed that growth rates in scallops heavily encrusted by sponges were significantly lower than in unencumbered ones.|$|E

The Fermenter was fabricated with galvanized iron, thus getting rid of the unhygienic methods of producing it locally. Samples were taken every day (24 hours) and stored in the deep freezer for further analysis. Fermentation increased the percent protein content from 32 to 40 % and to 52 % for anaerobic and aerobic fermentation processes respectively after 3 days (72 hours). Other parameters like % crude fibre, % ash content and % carbohydrate in both aerobic and anaerobic fermentation processes decreased with number of fermentation days from 9. 58 to 5. 29, 4. 05 to 3. 30, 36 to 23 and 9. 58 to 3. 824, 4. 05 to 0. 832, 36 to 19. 89 respectively. The biological changes such as physiological (odour, colour and appearance) and sensory (taste and texture) were studied. From experimental data generated by the design of experiment (DOE), using MINITAB 17 software, optimum conditions were obtained at 40 ⁰C with inoculum (Bacillus subtilis) concentration of 0. 005 (g broth/g seed) at fermentation duration of 3. 25 days. The product of the fermentation process ‘Iru’ was analyzed physiologically and organoleptically. The products of anaerobic fermentation were not acceptable organoleptically due to their <b>repulsive</b> <b>odour,</b> although was mild at lower temperature. The organoleptic test showed that the sample fermented with Bacillus subtilis was generally acceptable for all parameters tested. The mineral compositions of the fermentation product at different temperatures were analyzed and Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sodium, Manganese, Iron, Copper and Zinc were detected. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to study the effect of fermentation and temperature on the morphological structures of both fermented and unfermented samples. The deterioration rate of the fermented samples were studied to estimate the shelf life of the condiment with no additives. Dried condiment was stored for 6 weeks. The stored sample lasted for about 10 months...|$|E
40|$|La présence de {{concentrations}} élevées en métaux lourds retrouvés dans les boues de stations d'épuration est un facteur important limitant ainsi leurs différents modes de dispositions (rejet en mer, enfouissement, incinération, ou même recyclage comme fertilisant agricole ou forestier) par crainte de dégâts considérables qui pourraient être causés à l'environnement. L'objectif de ce travail consistait à mettre au point un procédé qui permettrait conjointement la stabilisation des boues municipales et l'enlèvement des métaux lourds qui y sont associés. L'approche poursuivie dans cette étude était de vérifier si ce procédé microbien, conçu pour enlever les métaux lourds associés aux boues municipales, pourrait éventuellement remplacer les procédés conventionnels de stabilisation des boues municipales, ce qui réduirait considérablement les temps et coûts de traitement. Ce procédé microbien consiste à utiliser des souches de thiobacilles qui oxydent le soufre élémentaire, produisant ainsi de l'acide sulfurique, et par la même occasion une forte baisse de pH (1. 5). Les résultats obtenus en cultures discontinues, en bioréacteurs, avec des boues primaires provenant de la station d'épuration de la Communauté Urbaine de Québec (C. U. Q. - Est) montrent que cette chute de pH entraîne une solubilisation importante des métaux (Cr: 56 %, Cu: 97 %, Fe: 30 à 40 %, Pb: 69 %, Zn: 98 %), du phosphore (52 %), ainsi qu'une réduction appréciable des matières volatiles en suspension (40 à 50 %), et ce, après seulement 7 jours de traitement. Le soufre nécessaire à la biolixiviation- stabilisation est introduit, dans le cas de notre étude, sous forme de granules ou de blocs. Ce choix de la forme de soufre influe beaucoup sur la qualité de la boue produite, ainsi que sur son pouvoir acidophile après neutralisation. Le soufre en blocs s'avère plus efficace et aussi préférable au soufre en granules quant au pouvoir acidophile, après neutralisation, de la boue produite. Given {{the potential}} geochemical mobility and recognizd toxicity of heavy metals, their presence at high concentrations in sewage sludges imposes serious limitations on various sludge disposal practices (ocean disposal, landfill, incineration, or {{use as a}} fertilizer in agriculture or forestry), The objectve of this work {{was to develop a}} process that would permit the simultaneous stabilization of sewage sludges and the removal of heavy metals associated with them. The approach followed was to verify if this microbial leaching procedure could eventually replace conventional sludge stabilization processes and hence considerably reduce the time and cost of treatment. The microbial process consists of using thiobacillus strains which, in the presence of air, oxidize elemental sulfur to sulfuric acid, thus reducing the pH to very acidic levels (pH 1. 5). This biological oxidation of elemental sulfur is brought about by two groups of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, the less-acidophilic and the acidophilic thiobacilli. The initial acid production and pH reduction is due to the less-acidophilic bactena (Thiobacillus thioparus) which lower the pH to about 4. 0. This is followed by the growth of acidophilic bacteria (Thiobacillus thiooxidans) and fruther pH reduction. Batch culture experiments were carried out in 30 L and 8 L reactors with primary sludges obtained from the Quebec urban community's wastewater treatment centre. Elemental sulfur and inoculum were added {{at the beginning of each}} experiment The inoculum was prepared by adding 1 % tyndalized sulfur powder to fresh secondary sludge and incubating for 8 days (final pH 1. 5 to 2. 0). A small portion (5 %) of this acidified sludge was then used as an inoculum for another batch of fresh sludge and this process was repeated several times until an acclimatized inoculum was obtained which could oxidize elemental sulfur rapidly, without an appreciable lag phase. The elemental sulfur necessary as substrate for the simultaneous bioleaching and sludge stabilization was introduced in the form of granules (2. 4 to 4 mm diameter) or blocks (25 mm diameter). Sludge pH and ORP were measured at 24 hour intervals and all other measurements were carried out at 48 hour intervals. The results demonstrate that the addition of elemental sulfur and inoculum resulted in a considerable lowering of the sludge pH during the incubation period. Such pH lowering was not observed in cultures to which sulfur and inoculum were not added. This lowering of pH (2. 1) was related to the quantity of substrate (sulfur) and inoculum present in the medium. An increase in the medium ORP (from - 50 to about 500 mV) was also observed. Acidification of the medium along with the elevated ORP levels resulted in the solubilization of metals initially present in the sludge. This pH reduction, after only 7 days of treatment, effected an important metal solubilization (Cr: 56 %, Cu: 97 %, Be: 30 - 40 %, Pb: 69 %, Zn: 98 %), as well as an appreciable reduction in phosphorus (52 %) and in the volatile suspended solids concentration (40 - 50 %). In addition, the sludge which initially had a highly <b>repulsive</b> <b>odour</b> was rendered odourless. In a previous study we had showm that for an optimum rate of acidification of the sludge a minimum concentration of elemental sulfur (2 g/L) was necessary, even though only 40 % of this sulfur was oxidized. In the present experiment the physical form of the sulfur was shown to influence both the quality of sludge produced and its acid-generating capacity after neutralization. Sulfur in the form of blocks was more efficient than granules in that the elemental sulfur could be readily separated from the sludge at the end of the treatment, yielding a sludge after neutralization that had a low acid-generating capacity. In the case of granules, the unused sulfur was broken down into a fine powder during the course of the bioleaching experiment and could not be separated from the leached sludge - even after neutralization, the leached sludge exhibited a high acid-generating capacity, which would limit its use as a fertilizer on agricultural land...|$|E
