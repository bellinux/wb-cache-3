5|$|On June 18, 2015, Manitoba Premier Greg Selinger {{became the}} first {{politician}} to issue a formal apology for the government's role in the Sixties Scoop. Class action lawsuits have been brought against the Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario governments for the harm caused to victims of the large-scale adoption scheme that saw thousands of Indigenous children forcibly removed from their parents in the 1960s. Indigenous leaders responded by insisting that while apologies were welcomed, action – including a federal apology, reunification of families, compensation and counselling for victims – must accompany words {{for them to have}} <b>real</b> <b>meaning.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1948, Shostakovich {{acquired}} {{a book of}} Jewish folk songs, and from this he composed the song cycle From Jewish Folk Poetry. He initially wrote eight songs that were meant to represent the hardships of being Jewish in the Soviet Union. However in order to disguise this, Shostakovich ended up adding three more songs meant to demonstrate the great life Jews had under the Soviet regime. Despite his efforts to hide the <b>real</b> <b>meaning</b> in the work, the Union of Composers refused to approve his music in 1949 {{under the pressure of}} the anti-Semitism that gripped the country. From Jewish Folk Poetry could not be performed until after Stalin’s death in March 1953, along with all the other works that were forbidden.|$|E

40|$|Unbeknownst {{to most of}} its users, the English {{language}} has always existed on two levels: (1) the surface level, with words and names possessing those meanings graciously conferred upon them by dictionaries, and (2) a subterranean level where words and names are used with their <b>real</b> <b>meanings.</b> This article presents a short glossary of English on the subterranean level: 56 undergrounders, as the terms are familiarly called.

40|$|The {{existence}} of sound-symbolism (or a non-arbitrary link between form and meaning) is well-attested. However, sound-symbolism has mostly been investigated with nonwords in forced choice tasks, {{neither of which}} are representative of natural language. This study uses ideophones, which are naturally occurring sound-symbolic words that depict sensory information, to investigate how sensitive Dutch speakers are to sound-symbolism in Japanese in a learning task. Participants were taught 2 sets of Japanese ideophones; 1 set with the ideophones' <b>real</b> <b>meanings</b> in Dutch, the other set with their opposite meanings. In Experiment 1, participants learned the ideophones and their <b>real</b> <b>meanings</b> {{much better than the}} ideophones with their opposite meanings. Moreover, despite the learning rounds, participants were still able to guess the <b>real</b> <b>meanings</b> of the ideophones in a 2 -alternative forced-choice test after they were informed of the manipulation. This shows that natural language sound-symbolism is robust beyond 2 -alternative forced-choice paradigms and affects broader language processes such as word learning. In Experiment 2, participants learned regular Japanese adjectives with the same manipulation, and {{there was no difference between}} real and opposite conditions. This shows that natural language sound-symbolism is especially strong in ideophones, and that people learn words better when form and meaning match. The highlights of this study are as follows: (a) Dutch speakers learn <b>real</b> <b>meanings</b> of Japanese ideophones better than opposite meanings, (b) Dutch speakers accurately guess meanings of Japanese ideophones, (c) this sensitivity happens despite learning some opposite pairings, (d) no such learning effect exists for regular Japanese adjectives, and (e) this shows the importance of sound-symbolism in scaffolding language learning...|$|R

25|$|According to David Kinsley, a {{professor}} of Religious Studies known for his studies on Hindu goddesses, the Krishna-Radha love story {{is a metaphor for}} divine-human relationship, where Radha is the human devotee or soul who is frustrated with the past, obligations to social expectations and the ideas she inherited, who then longs for <b>real</b> <b>meaning,</b> the true love, the divine (Krishna).

25|$|After a short fire fight, a {{white flag}} {{appeared}} at the German positions, {{and one of the}} Norwegian soldiers captured in the previous day′s ambush was sent over to the Norwegian forces. The released prisoner of war brought with him a demand that the Norwegians surrender and told the Norwegian officer in charge that Schmidt threatened to shoot his prisoners unless the fire ceased. This was probably based on a misunderstanding between the Norwegian POW and Oberleutnant Schmidt, the <b>real</b> <b>meaning</b> most likely being that the prisoners held were endangered by the mortar fire that the German positions were subjected to. In response to the surrender demands a German Feldwebel that the Norwegians had captured was despatched back to Schmidt calling for his surrender. The Germans likewise refused to give in.|$|E

25|$|Su Shi {{and friends}} {{continued}} to write poetry, despite (or perhaps encouraged by) their frequent banishment. Su Shi collected {{some of his}} extent works from friends, having ensured that any offending lines had been removed (Murck, 50). Some of his poetry began {{more and more to}} use such a deep and subtle allusive process that {{it would be difficult for}} those outside his group to grasp the <b>real</b> <b>meaning,</b> let alone put him back on trial. One of these techniques was to use rhymes from other poems; thus, alluding to lines from that poem, and also alluding to other poems which Su Shi and his friends circulated which also matched these rhymes. Subtle complexities of profound political dissent could then be masked under cover of seemingly innocuous lines about nature scenes in the Xiaoxiang region: indeed a set of 8 conventional scenes evolved (Murck, passim). These are known as the Eight Views of Xiaoxiang.|$|E

500|$|Critic Bill Wyman {{acknowledges}} that Lydon's [...] "fierce intelligence and astonishing onstage charisma" [...] were important catalysts, but ultimately finds the band's <b>real</b> <b>meaning</b> lies in McLaren's provocative media manipulations.

[...] "Malcolm milked situations", says Cook, [...] "he didn't instigate them; that was always our own doing." [...] It is also hard to ascribe {{the effect of the}} Sex Pistols' early Manchester shows on that city's nascent punk scene to anyone other than the musicians themselves. Matlock later wrote that at the point when he left the band, it was beginning to occur to him that McLaren [...] "was in fact quite deliberately perpetrating that idea of us as his puppets.... However, on the other hand, I've since found out that even Malcolm wasn't as aware of {{what he was up to}} as he has since made out." [...] By his absence, Matlock demonstrated how crucial he was to the band's creativity: in the eleven months between his departure and the Pistols' demise, they composed only two songs.|$|E

40|$|In {{interpreting}} verbal messages, humans use {{not only}} verbal information but also non-verbal signals such as facial expression. For example, {{when a person}} says yes with a troubled face, {{what he or she}} really means appears ambiguous. In the present study, we examined how deaf and hearing people differ in perceiving <b>real</b> <b>meanings</b> in texts accompanied by representations of facial expression. Deaf and hearing participants were asked to imagine that the face presented on the computer monitor was asked a question from another person (e. g., do you like her?). They observed either a realistic or a schematic face with a different magnitude of positive or negative expression on a computer monitor. A balloon that contained either a positive or negative text response to the question appeared {{at the same time as}} the face. Then, participants rated how much the individual on the monitor really meant it (i. e., perceived earnestness), using a 7 -point scale. Results showed that the facial expression significantly modulated the perceived earnestness. The influence of positive expression on negative text responses was relatively weaker than that of negative expression on positive responses (i. e., no tended to mean no irrespective of facial expression) for both participant groups. However, this asymmetrical effect was stronger in the hearing group. These results suggest that the contribution of facial expression in perceiving <b>real</b> <b>meanings</b> from text messages is qualitatively similar but quantitatively different between deaf and hearing people...|$|R
