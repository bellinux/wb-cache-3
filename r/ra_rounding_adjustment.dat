40|$|Introduction. We {{wanted to}} measure {{adherence}} to the guideline for depression in disability assessments. The research questions we addressed were: How can we develop performance indicators (PIs) for {{adherence to the}} Dutch guideline for disability assessment of patients with depression {{and how can we}} measure the quality of the scores? What is the inter-rater reliability of these PIs? What is the quality of the PI scores? Methods. PIs, developed by the researchers, were reviewed on various aspects, by a panel of seven experts in several consulting <b>rounds.</b> After <b>adjustments,</b> senior insurance physicians (IPs) attended two training sessions and scored the PIs on 10 different simulated case reports. Two researchers developed proxy 'gold standard' scores for these 10 case reports. To assess the inter-rater reliability {{and the quality of the}} scores, we calculated the intra-class correlations (ICC) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of the PI scores and of the PI scores compared to the proxy 'gold standard', respectively. Results. Six specific and relevant PIs resulted from the consultation of the panel of experts. The PI scores for the 10 case reports, rated by seven (of the eight) senior IPs who completed both training sessions, showed that the PIs were not reliable at individual level (ICC= 0. 543; 95 % CI 0. 4260. 642). However, the ICC became more reliable as an average of two raters was calculated (ICC= 0. 704). The ICC of the PI scores with the proxy 'gold standard' was 0. 538 (95 % CI 0. 4190. 640), but the quality was higher when calculated as an average of two raters (ICC= 0. 700). Conclusion. The PIs for adherence to the guideline were sufficiently reliable, and the quality of their scores was adequate if at least two well-trained raters were involved. The senior IPs evaluated the feasibility of the PIs as good, with a prerequisite of sufficient training.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{have been}} {{substantial}} {{improvements in the}} management of chronic pancreatitis, leading to the publication of several national guidelines during recent years. In collaboration with United European Gastroenterology, the working group on 'Harmonizing diagnosis and treatment of chronic pancreatitis across Europe' (HaPanEU) developed these European guidelines using an evidence-based approach. METHODS: Twelve multidisciplinary review groups performed systematic literature reviews to answer 101 predefined clinical questions. Recommendations were graded using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system and the answers were assessed by the entire group in a Delphi process online. The review groups presented their recommendations during the 2015 annual meeting of United European Gastroenterology. At this one-day, interactive conference, relevant remarks were voiced and overall agreement on each recommendation was quantified using plenary voting (Test and Evaluation Directorate). After a final <b>round</b> of <b>adjustments</b> based on these comments, a draft version was sent out to external reviewers. RESULTS: The 101 recommendations covered 12 topics related to the clinical management of chronic pancreatitis: aetiology (working party (WP) 1), diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis with imaging (WP 2 and WP 3), diagnosis of pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (WP 4), surgery in chronic pancreatitis (WP 5), medical therapy (WP 6), endoscopic therapy (WP 7), treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts (WP 8), pancreatic pain (WP 9), nutrition and malnutrition (WP 10), diabetes mellitus (WP 11) and the natural course of the disease and quality of life (WP 12). Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system, 70 of the 101 (70 %) recommendations were rated as 'strong' and plenary voting revealed 'strong agreement' for 99 (98 %) recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The 2016 HaPanEU/United European Gastroenterology guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations concerning key aspects of the medical and surgical management of chronic pancreatitis based on current available evidence. These recommendations should serve as a reference standard for existing management of the disease and as a guide for future clinical research...|$|R

Detailed microscale properties of till samples (from Scanning Electron Microscope [SEM] and thin section analysis) were examined from a glacial site with in situ subglacial process monitoring and an exposed subglacial surface in the foreland. Two lithofacies were examined, a grey sandy till derived from the ash and basalt, and a silty reddish brown till derived from oxidized paleosols and/or tephra layers. These also represented a clay-content continuum from low (0. 3 %) to high (22. 3 %). The evolution from debris to subglacial till was investigated.

Confluent monolayers of human skin fibroblasts were infected with these strains and overlaid with agar-medium. M. tuberculosis infection developed over 21 days as microcolonies originating within the plane of the fibroblasts. Microcolonies of the virulent strains had an elongated appearance and exhibited extensive cording. The cords appeared to invade adjacent cells within the plane of the monolayer. Microcolony diameter of the Erdman strain was significantly larger than that of the other virulent strains, indicating that virulent strains can have distinguishing phenotypes in this assay.

However, such estimates in the past appear to have understated first-quarter growth fairly consistently, even though they are adjusted to try to account for seasonal patterns. Applying a second <b>round</b> of seasonal <b>adjustment</b> corrects this residual seasonality. After this correction, aggregate output grew much faster in the first quarter than reported. In late April, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released its initial estimate of U. S. economic growth {{for the first three}} months of 2015. The report was very disappointing, as inflation-adjusted, or real, gross domestic product (GDP) edged up a mere 0. 2 % at an annual rate in the first quarter. This estimate was far weaker than many economists had forecast, and it raised concerns that the underlying economic recovery may have stalled. Such anemic growth is of particular concern to Federal Reserve policymakers considering when to begin normalizing monetary policy. However, a number of analysts have suggested that the reported weakness in first-quarter growth may have been exaggerated by a statistical anomaly (see, for example, Liesman 2015 and Wolfers 2015).

40|$|We {{present a}} simple {{distributed}} algorithm for maximizing 1 hop broadcast coverage in dense ad-hoc wireless networks, {{which is important}} because broad classes of routing, localization, and discovery protocols rely on periodic broadcasts. Our strategy for maximizing coverage is based on spatial reuse, where each node sets its radio range to maximize coverage using only locally observed packet arrival rate and device density. We derive and use a geometric-based, probabilistic model, which describes the expected coverage {{as a function of}} range, arrival rate and density. Because we can only numerically solve the resulting model, we develop a set of extrapolations which derive the optimum range for any rate and density given a single precomputed optimum. We then present a distributed range setting algorithm based on these extrapolations. Our algorithm is critically dependent on the empirical determination of the surrounding density but does not require any extra message exchanges. Rather, we show that the problem of incomplete density observations can be addressed by expanding the transmission range for just 2 % of the broadcasts. We show using simulation that our algorithm converges in under 15 broadcast <b>adjustment</b> <b>rounds</b> and provides ranges accurate to within 20 % of optimal across a wide variety of rates and densities for uniform networks. Using measured position data from our laboratory, we also show that our algorithm quickly converges and provides good coverage for highly non-uniform networks.

40|$|A {{descending}} (multi-item) clock auction (DCA) is {{a mechanism}} for buying items from multiple potential sellers. In the DCA, bidder-specific prices are decremented {{over the course of}} the auction. In each round, each bidder might accept or decline his offer price. Accepting means the bidder is willing to sell at that price. Rejecting means the bidder will not sell at that price or a lower price. DCAs have been proposed as the method for procuring spectrum from existing holders in the FCC’s imminent incentive auctions so spectrum can be repurposed to higher-value uses. However, the DCA design has lacked a way to determine the prices to offer the bidders in each round. This is a recognized, important, and timely problem. We present, to our knowledge, the first techniques for this. We develop a percentile-based approach which provides a means to naturally reduce the offer prices to the bidders through the bidding rounds. We also develop an optimization model for setting prices so as to minimize expected payment while stochastically satisfying the feasibility constraint. (The DCA has a final <b>adjustment</b> <b>round</b> that obtains feasibility after feasibility has been lost in the final round of the main DCA.) We prove attractive properties of this, such as symmetry and monotonicity. We developed computational methods for solving the model.

We present experiments both on the homogeneous items case and the case of FCC incentive auctions, where we use real interference constraint data to get a fully faithful model of feasibility. An unexpected paradox about DCAs is that some-times when the number of rounds allowed increases, the final payment increases. We provide an explanation for this...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a review of}} common statistical disclosure control (SDC) methods implemented at statistical agencies for standard tabular outputs containing whole population counts from a census (either enumerated or based on a register). These methods include record swapping on the microdata prior to its tabulation and rounding of entries in the tables after they are produced. The approach for assessing SDC methods {{is based on a}} disclosure risk-data utility framework and the need to find a balance between managing disclosure risk while maximizing the amount of information that can be released to users and ensuring high quality outputs. To carry out the analysis, quantitative measures of disclosure risk and data utility are defined and methods compared. Conclusions from the analysis show that record swapping as a sole SDC method leaves high probabilities of disclosure risk. Targeted record swapping lowers the disclosure risk, but there is more distortion of distributions. Small cell <b>adjustments</b> (<b>rounding)</b> give protection to census tables by eliminating small cells but only one set of variables and geographies can be disseminated in order to avoid disclosure by differencing nested tables. Full random rounding offers more protection against disclosure by differencing, but margins are typically rounded separately from the internal cells and tables are not additive. Rounding procedures protect against the perception of disclosure risk compared to record swapping since no small cells appear in the tables. Combining rounding with record swapping raises the level of protection but increases the loss of utility to census tabular outputs. For some statistical analysis, the combination of record swapping and rounding balances to some degree opposing effects that the methods have on the utility of the tables. Copyright 2007 The Author.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This doctoral research aims to investigate the reputation building process of companies and to examine the applicability of western-developed theories about the uses of corporate reputation in a non-western context. It is the first study that synthesises three theories (value creation, strategic resources and corporate communication) to examine the strategic consequences of the uses of corporate reputation. Corporate reputation is an attribute or a set of attributes ascribed to a firm and inferred from the firm’s past actions. It is the belief of market participants about a firm’s strategic character (Weigelt and Camerer, 1988). Also, corporate reputation is the public’s cumulative judgement of a firm over time (Roberts and Dowling, 2002). The review of theoretical literature indicates the uses of corporate reputation by business organizations can be theorized along six dominant paradigmatic perspectives: 1 -public relations; 2 -marketing; 3 -management, 4 -economic; 5 -sociological; 6 -finance and accounting. The uses of corporate reputation in these six paradigms are comprehensively discussed. The objective {{of this study is}} to establish the use of corporate reputation in the development of brand image strategy. A review of the uses of the concept of corporate reputation is discussed in detail in chapter 2. The review of the literature also identified a research gap by showing that scarce research has been conducted on how these three main functions (value creation, strategic resources and corporate communication) affect a company’s brand positioning strategy. The following research question thus is proposed: How do (Taiwanese pharmaceutical) companies use their corporate reputation to develop a brand image strategy? The research hypotheses based on three theories (value-based theory, resource-based theory and integrated marketing communication theory) appear in Chapter 3. The research question is constructed theoretically, and then a conceptual model, which begins with three antecedents of corporate reputation and simultaneously illustrates the outcomes of their use, are discussed. The construct of the uses of corporate reputation has three dimensions: value creation, strategic resources and corporate communication. Each of these three dimensions includes several items. The items were proposed based on the previous researchers’ summaries and the qualitative interview. The researcher will then depict the proposed research conceptual framework and a number of hypotheses that will be further investigated and tested. Then the quantative study was completed by providing the data analysis and the results were explained. A multi-stage procedure was involved in this research. First, data examination and screening to prepare for subsequent quantitative analyses and then the descriptive statistics were presented. Second, a reliability test was performed on measurement scales to ensure that they achieve an acceptable level of reliability for further analysis. The resulting solutions were then re-assessed using confirmatory factor analysis. Finally, PLS (Partial Least Squares) was used to test the hypothesized relationships between the research constructs as postulated in the conceptual model, and to assess the overall goodness-of-fit between the proposed model and the collected data set. The researcher then discusses the validation of the measurement model and the research findings. The findings are then further discussed in terms of the contribution to marketing theory and relevance to marketing managers. Then the items of adapted scales were subjected to several <b>rounds</b> of <b>adjustments</b> and were finally found to possess acceptable measurement properties. Reliability and construct validity tests indicated that all scales satisfied widely accepted criteria such as the minimum reliability of 0. 7. The results of scale purification will be discussed. And an evaluation of the research hypotheses and their significance are summarized, the findings of all hypotheses testing will be reviewed and compared with previous research. According to the research findings, the hypotheses that value creation, as one dimension of corporate reputation, has a positive impact on brand segmentation, brand differentiation and brand positioning are all accepted. The hypotheses that strategic resource, as one dimension of corporate reputation, has a positive impact on brand segmentation and brand differentiation are rejected. However, the hypothesis that strategic resource, as one dimension of corporate reputation, has a positive impact on brand positioning is accepted. The hypotheses that corporate communication, as one dimension of corporate reputation, has a positive impact on brand segmentation and brand differentiation are both accepted. The hypothesis that corporate communication, as one dimension of corporate reputation, has a positive impact on brand positioning is partially supported. Finally, the hypothesis that the (see in Table 5. 18) moderating effect of price policy on corporate reputation has a positive impact on brand image strategy is partially but negatively supported. This thesis makes a significant contribution to the study of corporate reputation of firms in the Taiwanese pharmaceutical industry from the robustness of the qualitative and quantitative data collection...|$|R
