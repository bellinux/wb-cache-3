30|$|Korman et al. [24] {{indicated}} higher {{values of}} permeability of MSW, {{which might be}} attributed to the heterogeneity and <b>reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> in the laboratory. With degradation the particle size of the degradable constituent in MSW was expected to decrease which might significantly influence the permeability of MSW. When the coefficient is higher than about 10 − 4  cm/s the material is considered self-draining, whereas coefficients lower than 10 − 9  cm/s are considered impervious.|$|E
40|$|Summary: Over 100 {{laboratories}} {{participated in}} an external quality-control survey (EQCS) for T 3 and T 4, using the Munich Model as conceived in this laboratory ((1 - 4) : Marschner,!, et al. (1974), Horm. Met. Res. 6, 293 - 296; Horn,K. et al. (1976), this J. 14, 353 - 360; Marschner J. et al. (1976), this J. 14, 345 - 351; Wood, W. G. et al. (1980), this J. 18, 183 - 192) and carried out over the past 6 years. Twenty lyophilised serum samples, including independant hidden standard curves for T 3 and T 4, were dispatched by post together with a detailed questionnaire and full instructions on <b>reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples.</b> <b>The</b> returned data were processed as previously described ((4) : Wood, W. G. et al. (1980), this J. 18, 183 - 192) and each participant received a full analysis of his«own data {{and a set of}} histogrammes with which he could visually check his performance against other laboratories. An explanatory letter was sent, which explained the computer print-out, <b>the</b> coding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kits and contained a con-structive report <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participant's performance and helpful advice as to how to improve the assay if this was necessary. From 110 laboratories returning data for T 3, 86 were fully useable, 22 partly and 2 unuseable because T 3 -uptake had been performed instead of T 3 -radioimmunoassay (RIA). From 124 laboratories returning T 4 EQCS data, 102 were fully useable and 22 partly useable. In both cases the partly useable sets of data did not contain important items such as the count rates (or absorption values) for each serum, needed for construction and read-off of value...|$|R

40|$|The globin gene is {{preferentially}} {{sensitive to}} digestion by DNase I in erythrocyte chromatin {{but not in}} brain, fibroblast, or oviduct chromatin. Elution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> erythrocyte chromatin with 0. 35 M NaCl leads to no detectable change in <b>the</b> gross structure <b>of</b> individual nucleosomes; however, in this depleted chromatin the globin gene is no longer preferentially sensitive to DNase I. <b>Reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> depleted chromatin with either the entire 0. 35 M NaCl fraction or a subclass from this fraction greatly enriched in two high mobility group proteins (nos. 14 and 17) results in <b>the</b> successful <b>reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> DNase I sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> globin gene. For all <b>of</b> these preparations, <b>the</b> inactive ovalbumin gene exhibited no preferential sensitivity to DNase I. <b>Reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> erythrocyte 0. 35 M NaCl fraction with depleted brain chromatin resulted in no preferential sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> globin gene in brain chromatin; however, <b>reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain 0. 35 M NaCl fraction with depleted erythrocyte chromatin led to successful <b>reconstitution</b> <b>of</b> DNase I sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> globin gene.
