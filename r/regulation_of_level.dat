40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: {{the roots of}} the green plants and ethiolated shoots of pea pisum sativum L. The purpose of the work: {{studying}} the cAMP-dependent proteinkinase activity {{and the role of the}} ferments of dephosphorilation - phosphoproteinphosphotases in the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>level</b> of the plants proteins phosphorilation. Shown has been the possibility of determination of the cAMP-dependent proteinkinase activity with the aid of the high-specific protein inhibitor cAMP-dependent proteinkinases in the rough extracts of plants. The influence of detergents (SDS and triton X- 100) on the cAMP-dependent proteinkinase activity of the plants has been revealed. The change of spectres of the phosphorilated proteins with the effect of inhibitors of phosphotases of tungstate and molybdate has been shown. The revealed role of inhibitors of phosphatases of tungstate, molybdate, vanadate inserts the contribution to the revealation of functioning of the system of the secondary mediators of plants and explains the mechanism of high toxicity of these salts - the anthropogenous stressors. The results on the action of inhibitors of phosphotases allow to increase the level of measured activity of proteinkinases (including the cAMP-dependent) and create the reasons for its further study in the vegetative objectsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E

Here we review the extent to which this activity-dependent regulation is observed for a range of different transmitters. Strikingly the homeostatic paradigm is observed both for classical and for peptide transmitters and in mature as well as in embryonic nervous systems. Transmitter homeostasis adds another dimension to homeostatic <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> function in the nervous system that includes <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> voltage-gated ion channels, densities of neurotransmitter receptors, and synapse numbers and strength.

40|$|UvrB is {{specifically}} proteolyzed in Escherichia coli cell extracts to UvrB*. UvrB* {{is capable of}} interacting with UvrA in an aparently similar manner to the UvrB, however UvrB* is defective in the DNA strand displacement activity normally displayed by UvrAB. Whereas the binding of UvrC to a UvrAB-DNA complex leads to DNA incision and persistence of a stable post-incision protein-DNA complex, the binding of UvrC to UvrAB* leads to dissociation of the protein complex and no DNA incision is seen. The factor which stimulates this proteolysis has been partially purified and its substrate specificity has been examined. The protease factor is induced by “stress” and is under control of the htpR gene. The potential role of this proteolysis in the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> active repair enzymes in the cell is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Heriot was {{the right}} of a lord in feudal Europe to seize a serf's best horse, clothing, or both, upon his death. It arose from the {{tradition}} of the lord lending a serf a horse or armour or weapons to fight so that when the serf died the lord would rightfully reclaim his property. Payments of heriot are sometimes mentioned in the wills of West-Saxon nobles from the mid-tenth century onward (a case in question is that <b>of</b> Æthelmær). The <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> heriot {{is the subject of a}} clause in Cnut's secular law-code (II Cnut § 71), drawn up between 1020 and 1023. The form of this duty depended on the rank of the nobleman (earl, king's thegn, median thegn) and on his region (Danelaw, Wessex).|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} {{total and}} free protein S (PS), protein C (PC) and factor X (FX) in 393 healthy blood donors to assess differences {{in relation to}} sex, hormonal state and age. All measured proteins were lower in women as compared to men, as were levels in premenopausal women as compared to postmenopausal women. Multiple regression analysis showed that both age and subgroup (men, pre- and postmenopausal women) were of significance for the <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> total and free PS and PC, the subgroup effect being caused by {{the differences between the}} premenopausal women and the other groups. This indicates a role of sex-hormones, most likely estrogens, in the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> pro- and anticoagulant factors under physiologic conditions.

40|$|During {{goal-directed}} decision-making, animals must integrate {{information from}} the external environment and their internal state to maximize resource localization while minimizing energy expenditure. How this complex problem is solved by the nervous system remains poorly understood. Here, using a combined behavioural and neurophysiological approach, we demonstrate that the mollusc Lymnaea performs a sophisticated form of decision-making during food-searching behaviour, using a core system consisting of just two neuron types. The first reports the presence of food and the second encodes motivational state acting as a gain controller for adaptive behaviour {{in the absence of}} food. Using an in vitro analogue of the decision-making process, we show that the system employs an energy management strategy, switching between a low- and high-use mode depending on the outcome of the decision. Our study reveals a parsimonious mechanism that drives a complex decision-making process via <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> tonic inhibition and phasic excitation...|$|R

We report that adrenomedullary GC receptors are translocated, both in response to nM concentrations of GCs, {{and in response to}} higher concentrations of GCs encountered by the glands during stress. We show that long-term increases in cyclic nucleotide second messengers are able to decrease GC receptor binding in adrenal medullary cells, via a mechanism independent of released cortisol, and provide the first evidence that changes in adrenomedullary GC receptor levels are reflected in an alteration in a GC-mediated function, i. e. induction of PNMT. We also provide novel in vitro evidence for the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> adrenomedullary PNMT activity, following a necessary lag period, by acute changes in both cortisol and nicotine. In addition, our in vitro studies are supported by our in vivo findings which show increases in adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT activity 18 h following a single episode of mild acute stress (20 min restraint) in rats...|$|R

40|$|Accumulation of {{unfolded}} protein or misfolded protein causes {{endoplasmic reticulum}} (ER) stress. Increased salt concentration activates a stress response pathway in the ER in Arabidopsis thaliana to induce {{the expression of}} several salt stress response genes, leading to a more optimal protein folding environment in the ER. In addition, some salt stress-regulated proteins require zinc for their activity, including some zinc-dependent DNA binding proteins and zinc-finger proteins. In a recent study, we reported that ZTP 29, a putative zinc transporter at the ER membrane, {{is involved in the}} response to salt stress through <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> zinc <b>level</b> in the ER to induce the UPR pathway.

40|$|The {{chlorophyll}} degradation pathway {{is central}} {{to a number of}} plant processes including senescence and fruit ripening. However, the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> the chlorophyll degradation pathway enzymes is not well understood. The aim of this thesis was to elucidate the genetic mechanisms that control changes in pigment composition leading to fruit flesh yellowing in kiwifruit. Actinidia deliciosa and A. chinensis fruit, which are green and yellow, respectively, provide an opportunity to study the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> chlorophyll <b>levels.</b> The expression <b>of</b> genes that code for enzymes of the chlorophyll and cytokinin metabolic pathways was measured using qRT-PCR. Candidates for chlorophyll degradation regulatory points were then characterised for functionality by transient transformation in N. benthamiana. The endogenous cytokinin levels were measured in kiwifruit and transient activation assays were carried out with the promoters of key candidate genes. Overall, expression of the chlorophyll degradation genes was elevated in yellow fruit and expression of biosynthetic genes was higher in green fruit. The chlorophyll degradation-associated protein, STAY-GREEN 2 (SGR 2), was more highly expressed in yellow fruit, and transient over-expression of SGR was sufficient to drive chlorophyll degradation. Expression of isopentenyl transferase (IPT), the rate-limiting step for cytokinin biosynthesis, showed an increase towards maturity in green fruit, but not in yellow fruit. However, both fruit had similar high <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cytokinin nucleotides and free bases. A gene coding for O-glucosylation was also highly expressed in green fruit. Green fruit contained higher <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> cytokinin O-glucosides and ribosides towards maturity, suggesting differences in cytokinin signalling, which could lead to <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> chlorophyll <b>levels</b> via activation <b>of</b> the SGR promoter by transcription factors. It is likely that the chlorophyll degradation pathway and cytokinin metabolism are linked. The differential expression of cytokinin response regulators could lead to differential <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> cytokinin <b>levels</b> in the fruit of the two species, and possibly differential <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> the chlorophyll degradation pathway. Progress towards elucidation of the control <b>of</b> chlorophyll <b>levels</b> provides knowledge <b>of</b> this key process in kiwifruit and potentially gene-based markers for breeding new kiwifruit cultivars...|$|R

As these proteins were detectable only {{in the presence of}} each other in a variety of cell lines, we studied the mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> cellular <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> annexin II and p 11. In cells expressing p 11 messenger RNA, p 11 protein is undetectable unless annexin II is also expressed. As an example, the hepatoblastoma HepG 2 cell line displays no detectable annexin II nor p 11 protein, although it expresses p 11 mRNA. The overexpression of annexin II by gene transfer into HepG 2 cells leads to the up-regulation <b>of</b> the cellular <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> p 11 by a post-translational mechanism. In the presence of annexin II, there is no major change in the p 11 transcript levels, but the half-life of the p 11 protein is increased more than 6 -fold.
