5|$|Annealing is {{the process}} of heating the steel to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally <b>relieves</b> strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.|$|E

40|$|This MSc thesis {{focuses on}} {{two types of}} quay walls, namely the {{anchored}} quay wall without <b>relieving</b> structure and the quay wall with <b>relieving</b> structure. In the case of high retaining heights the anchored quay wall mostly consists of a combined sheet pile wall, {{which means that the}} wall is composed by tubular steel members that are connected by means of sheet piles. In some cases quay walls are provided with a <b>relieving</b> structure. A <b>relieving</b> structure consists of a concrete structure founded on the combined sheet pile wall and bearing piles. The function of the <b>relieving</b> structure is to reduce the pressure on the retaining wall caused by the surface load and soil on the <b>relieving</b> structure. In this thesis the engineering aspects (moments and displacements of the wall and anchor forces) and the economic aspects (costs) of quay wall designs with and without <b>relieving</b> structure are analysed. Also two calculation methods are compared, the beam on elastic foundation and the finite element method. The results of the calculation showed that from an engineering point of view, the <b>relieving</b> structure is more favourable. The displacements, moments and anchor forces when a <b>relieving</b> structure is present are smaller than the ones calculated when the <b>relieving</b> structure is absent. Also {{in the case of the}} failure of one anchor a <b>relieving</b> structure gives a better redistribution of forces due to the high stiffness of the slab of the <b>relieving</b> structure. The cost estimation performed in this thesis lead to the conclusion that a quay wall with <b>relieving</b> structure is more expensive that a quay wall without it. The main contribution to the costs of the analysed quay walls come from the steel combined wall. The price of the steel primary members (steel tubes) depends on the way they are fabricated. When the tubes exceed certain limit in dimensions the fabrication costs increase with a factor 1. 5 to 2. In this thesis, the calculated elements of all variants exceed this limit, which lead to high costs of the fabrication of steel tubes for both, the quay wall with and without <b>relieving</b> structure. During decision making the parties involved would have to consider whether the reduction of the costs by using a quay wall without <b>relieving</b> structure overrun the aforementioned engineering aspects. An important aspect is that when the <b>relieving</b> structure is absent the dimensions of the primary elements of the combined wall increase and are considered extraordinary in onshore projects. The companies that can install such elements are limited and even offshore equipment would be necessary, which could increase the total costs of the project. Regarding the calculation methods some remarkable differences where found, specially in the calculation of the anchor forces. The moments in the retaining structure for both cases with and without <b>relieving</b> structure calculated with D-sheet vary sligtly from the ones calculated with PLAXIS, a maximum difference of 20 % is found. When the <b>relieving</b> structure is absent the anchor forces calculated with both methods differ in a range of 20 %. When a <b>relieving</b> structure is present D-sheet estimates forces that are 30 % to 35 % lower than PLAXIS when the <b>relieving</b> structure has a length of 10 meters. When the <b>relieving</b> structure length increases to 20 meters, D-sheet calculates anchor forces that are 20 % to 60 % lower than PLAXIS. Literature review showed that the method to estimate horizontal pressures due to strip loads used by D-sheet underestimates the resultant force acting on the wall, which leads to an under estimation of anchor forces.

5|$|The {{nature of}} {{treatment}} for a Myrmecia sting depends on {{the severity of the}} reaction. If no signs of an allergic reaction are seen, an ice pack or commercially available spray is used to relieve the pain. Washing the stung area, stingose, and the use of antihistamine tablets are other methods to reduce the pain. Indigenous Australians use bush remedies to treat Myrmecia stings, such as rubbing the tips of bracken ferns onto the stung area. Carpobrotus glaucescens is also used to treat stung areas, using juices that are squeezed and rubbed onto the area, which quickly <b>relieves</b> the pain from the sting.|$|E

5|$|Malawi {{has adopted}} task {{shifting}} strategies {{to overcome the}} shortage of workers available for HIV/AIDS treatment and care. Task shifting, which {{has been successful in}} many other regions, involves training less specialized health workers to perform health-related tasks that do not require professional training, such as the initiation of antiretroviral therapy. For example, at Thyolo District Hospital, health workers spend one week learning how to initiate antiretroviral therapy in a classroom setting and an additional two weeks practicing their knowledge in a supervised clinical setting; after completing this course, they are legally (under Ministry of Health guidelines) allowed to initiate antiretroviral therapy. Another form of task shifting involves training health-oriented counselors in HIV testing and counseling, which <b>relieves</b> nurses of this additional task.|$|E
5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep apnea co-exists. CPAP requires the use during sleep of a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This <b>relieves</b> the features of obstructive sleep apnea and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E

5|$|Spotted hyenas feature {{prominently}} in the rituals of certain African cultures. In the Gelede cult of the Yoruba people of Benin and Southwest Nigeria, a spotted hyena mask is used at dawn to signal {{the end of the}} èfè ceremony. As the spotted hyena usually finishes the meals of other carnivores, the animal is associated with the conclusion of all things. Among the Korè cult of the Bambara people in Mali, the belief that spotted hyenas are hermaphrodites appears as an ideal in-between in the ritual domain. The role of the spotted hyena mask in their rituals is often to turn the neophyte into a complete moral being by integrating his male principles with femininity. The Beng people believe that upon finding a freshly killed hyena with its anus inverted, one must plug it back in, for fear of being struck down with perpetual laughter. They also view spotted hyena faeces as contaminating, and will evacuate a village if a hyena <b>relieves</b> itself within village boundaries. In Harar, Ethiopia, spotted hyenas are regularly fed by the city's inhabitants, who believe the hyenas' presence keeps devils at bay, and associate mystical properties such as fortune telling to them.|$|E

In cases of immediate threats to the independence, unity and existence of the state, the president may order the use of armed forces, even if no state of war is declared, provided that such an order is countersigned by the prime minister. During a state of war, the president may promulgate regulations with the force of law on the basis of, and within the scope of, authority obtained from the parliament. In such circumstances, the president may convene government cabinet meetings and preside over them. If the parliament is not in session, the president is authorized to regulate all matters required by the state of war through regulations carrying the force of law. In case of an immediate threat to the independence, unity and existence of the state, or if the governmental bodies are prevented from performing their constitutional duties regularly, the president may, at the proposal of the prime minister, issue regulations carrying the force of law. Such regulations must also be countersigned by the prime minister to become valid. The president is required to submit regulations that are promulgated thus to the parliament for approval as soon as the parliament may convene, otherwise the regulations become void.
