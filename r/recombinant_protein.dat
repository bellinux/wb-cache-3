25|$|Although {{some of the}} {{properties}} of PfEMP1 were firmly established, the protein was difficult to isolate due to its low occurrence. Five years after its discovery, {{one of the original}} researchers Irwin Sherman began to doubt the existence of PfEMP1 as a unique protein. He argued that the antigen could be merely a surface protein of RBCs that changes upon infection with malarial parasites. A consensus was achieved in 1995 following the identification (by cloning) of the gene for PfEMP1. The discovery of the genes was independently reported by Howard's team and two other teams at NIH. Howard's team identified two genes for PfEMP1, and <b>recombinant</b> <b>protein</b> products of these genes were shown to have antigenic and adhesive properties. They further affirmed that PfEMP1 is the key molecule in the ability of P. falciparum to evade the host's immune system. Joseph D. Smith and others showed that PfEMP1 is actually a large family of proteins encoded by a multigene family called var. The gene products can bind to a variety of receptors including those on endothelial cells. Xin-Zhuan Su and others showed that there could be more than 50 var genes which are distributed on different chromosomes of the malarial parasite.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{overproduction}} of <b>recombinant</b> <b>proteins</b> in host cells {{often leads}} to their misfolding and aggregation. Previous attempts to increase the solubility of <b>recombinant</b> <b>proteins</b> by co-overproduction of individual chaperones were only partially successful. We now assessed the effects of combined overproduction of the functionally cooperating chaperone network of the E. coli cytosol on the solubility of <b>recombinant</b> <b>proteins.</b> Results A two-step procedure was found to show the strongest enhancement of solubility. In a first step, the four chaperone systems GroEL/GroES, DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE, ClpB and the small HSPs IbpA/IbpB, were coordinately co-overproduced with <b>recombinant</b> <b>proteins</b> to optimize de novo folding. In a second step, protein biosynthesis was inhibited to permit chaperone mediated refolding of misfolded and aggregated proteins in vivo. This novel strategy increased the solubility of 70 % of 64 different heterologous proteins tested up to 42 -fold. Conclusion The engineered E. coli strains and the two-step procedure presented here led to a remarkable increase in the solubility of a various <b>recombinant</b> <b>proteins</b> and should be applicable {{to a wide range}} of target proteins produced in biotechnology. </p...|$|R

2500|$|Vaccine {{production}} has several stages. First, the antigen itself is generated. Viruses are grown either on primary cells such as chicken eggs (e.g., for influenza) or on continuous cell lines such as cultured human cells (e.g., for hepatitis A). [...] Bacteria are grown in bioreactors (e.g., Haemophilus influenzae type b). Likewise, a <b>recombinant</b> <b>protein</b> {{derived from the}} viruses or bacteria can be generated in yeast, bacteria, or cell cultures. After the antigen is generated, it is isolated from the cells used to generate it. A virus {{may need to be}} inactivated, possibly with no further purification required. Recombinant proteins need many operations involving ultrafiltration and column chromatography. Finally, the vaccine is formulated by adding adjuvant, stabilizers, and preservatives as needed. The adjuvant enhances the immune response of the antigen, stabilizers increase the storage life, and preservatives allow the use of multidose vials. Combination vaccines are harder to develop and produce, because of potential incompatibilities and interactions among the antigens and other ingredients involved.|$|E
