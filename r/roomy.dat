5|$|In a study, eight addax antelopes {{on a diet}} {{of grass}} hay (Chloris gayana) were studied to {{determine}} the retention time of food from the digestive tract. It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a <b>roomy</b> rumen.|$|E
5|$|The double bottoms {{are also}} subject to design constraints. The primary {{concern is that}} they be high enough to allow the passage of pipes and cables. These areas must also be <b>roomy</b> enough to allow people safe access to perform surveys and maintenance. On the other hand, {{concerns}} of excess weight and wasted volume keep the double bottoms very tight spaces.|$|E
5|$|During the Apollo 11 launch, Armstrong's heart {{reached a}} top rate of 110 beats per minute. He {{found the first}} stage to be the loudest—much noisier than the Gemini 8 Titan II launch—and the Apollo CSM was {{relatively}} <b>roomy</b> compared to the Gemini capsule. This ability to move around was suspected to be the reason why none of the Apollo 11 crew suffered from space sickness, while members of previous crews did. Armstrong was especially happy, {{as he had been}} prone to motion sickness as a child and could experience nausea after doing long periods of aerobatics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roomies!</b> was {{succeeded by}} It's Walky!, {{a science fiction}} {{adventure}} comedy comic set in the same universe. The main cast of It's Walky! included some continuing characters from <b>Roomies!</b> — in particular Joyce, Danny's former stalker — {{and by the end}} most of the major characters from <b>Roomies!</b> had made appearances.|$|R
50|$|It's Walky! was {{the direct}} {{continuation}} of <b>Roomies!.</b> The debut of It's Walky! {{is considered to}} have been on December 25, 1999, but the switch between the two was not instantaneous; science fiction elements had crept into the college environment of <b>Roomies!</b> long before, and the webcomic featured storylines from both for a while. A few characters from <b>Roomies!</b> became main characters in It's Walky!, and the remaining protagonists later {{made it into the}} cast as secondary characters.|$|R
50|$|Annie Monroe is an American {{actress and}} musician. She {{is best known}} for her role as Chloe in the 2015 dark comedy film Bad <b>Roomies,</b> and for playing the organ in the {{alternative}} rock group The Like. In Bad <b>Roomies,</b> she stars alongside actors Tommy Savas and Patrick Renna.|$|R
5|$|The Hotel Valley Ho is a {{striking}} example of the mid-century modern architectural style. Varney's use of masonry, cast and poured concrete, natural stone, and wide expanses of glass make for a close connection between the building and its environment. Stone floor and wall patterns link the exterior entry and the lobby, as does {{the extension of the}} redwood ceiling. The hotel is now considered one of the finest examples of organic architecture. Rooms in the two adjacent wings added in the late 1950s are unusual, and remarkably forward-thinking even by mid-century design standards, for their high nine-foot-ceilings. The prevailing trend at the time of original construction was low-ceilinged rooms, in some cases with ceilings only seven feet above ground level, but the Valley Ho's rooms feel exceptionally <b>roomy</b> and airy thanks to its original decision to buck design trends.|$|E
25|$|The armored cockpit was {{relatively}} <b>roomy</b> and comfortable, offering good visibility. A modern-day U.S. ground-attack aircraft, the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, takes {{its name from}} the P-47.|$|E
25|$|Improvement in Dairy farming: The cowsheds {{under the}} matha were modernized. The sheds were made larger, more <b>roomy</b> and airy for the cattle.

25|$|What emerged {{was a new}} {{art deco}} cinema, renamed the Regal. The old {{building}} remained intact behind the new streamlined façade {{and most of the}} interior was left untouched apart from new seating and electrical work. The seating capacity was reduced to a more <b>roomy</b> 650. The cinema was set to compete.|$|E
25|$|The back is straight, {{strong and}} firm. The loins are short, strong and deep. The croup is broad, of medium length, and {{slightly}} rounded, neither flat nor falling away. The chest is <b>roomy,</b> broad and deep (approximately 50% {{of the shoulder}} height) with a well-developed forechest and well sprung ribs. The flanks are not tucked up.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{after he}} {{finished}} It's Walky!, David Willis restarted <b>Roomies!</b> as a daily gag strip, appearing on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It was also published {{as part of the}} Keenspot comic page in the Turlock, California newspaper, the Turlock Journal. <b>Roomies!</b> ended again on May 19, 2005, when David Willis left Keenspot to found Blank Label Comics.|$|R

50|$|In 1999, College <b>Roomies</b> from Hell!!! {{began as}} a newspaper-style serial, though its fantastical plot overtook the fairly {{grounded}} story during its first year. Over time, Campos-Revolledo's artstyle developed significantly, causing later strips to look substantially different from her early work. Despite its shaky update schedule, College <b>Roomies</b> from Hell!!! {{became one of the}} longest running webcomics, and as of April 2017, it is still ongoing.|$|R
25|$|The Montgomery-class cruisers {{were three}} {{unprotected}} cruisers {{built for the}} United States Navy in the early 1890s. They had a thin water-tight protective deck, and also relied for protection upon their coal bunkers, cellulose packing, and numerous compartments. <b>Roomy</b> accommodations were provided for officers and crew, these cruisers being mainly intended for long cruises on distant stations.|$|E
25|$|On {{hatching}} the larva webs {{the edges}} of leaves together with silk to form a <b>roomy</b> cell from a leaf in which it resides throughout the larval stage. When disturbed, it can move quite briskly and even drop off. The caterpillars of the brown awl grow faster than most of those of other families, and have moist, sticky droppings.|$|E
25|$|Vermeer's {{works are}} largely genre pieces and portraits, with the {{exception}} of two cityscapes and two allegories. His subjects offer a cross-section of seventeenth-century Dutch society, ranging from the portrayal of a simple milkmaid at work, to the luxury and splendour of rich notables and merchantmen in their <b>roomy</b> houses. Besides these subjects, religious, poetical, musical, and scientific comments can also be found in his work.|$|E

25|$|The XP-47B was of {{all-metal}} construction (except for the fabric-covered {{tail control}} surfaces) with elliptical wings, {{with a straight}} leading edge that was slightly swept back. The air-conditioned cockpit was <b>roomy</b> and the pilot's seat was comfortable—"like a lounge chair", as one pilot later put it. The canopy doors hinged upward. Main and auxiliary self-sealing fuel tanks were placed under the cockpit, giving a total fuel capacity of 305U.S. gal (1,155L).|$|E
25|$|While the Series 200 {{was more}} commercially attractive, {{with no more}} Series 100 being ordered, sales were still slow. While the Herald was cheap {{compared}} to its major competitors, and in the 200 series had a <b>roomy</b> cabin, the Friendship could carry a larger payload and both the Friendship and the Avro 748 had better performance, resulting in superior long-term economics. By 1963, only 35 Heralds had been sold compared with over 240 Friendships.|$|E
25|$|The Rose turret was a <b>roomy</b> design {{equipped}} with two M2 Browning heavy machine guns. The turret {{was driven by}} hydraulics, and the hydraulic system was easier to use than that in previous designs. The considerable internal space meant that the turret could be fitted with two seats: a layout in which one man operated the guns and the other fed targeting data into the gunsight computer was developed, but not used in practice.|$|E

25|$|The nearby cave monastery of Saint Elijah and the Holy Trinity {{features}} a small eponymous church, which was constructed 800 years ago. The <b>roomy</b> Trinity cathedral, {{one of the}} most imposing monuments of the Cossack baroque, was erected between 1679 and 1689. Its refectory, with the adjoining church of Presentation to the Temple, was finished by 1679. There are also the 17th-century towered walls, monastic cells, and the five-tiered belfry from the 1780s.|$|E
25|$|The Battle was {{a robust}} {{aircraft}} which was frequently {{described as being}} easy to fly, even for relatively inexperienced pilots. The pilot was provided with overall good external visibility and the cockpit {{was considered to be}} <b>roomy</b> and comfortable for the era; however, the task of simultaneously deploying the flaps and the retractable undercarriage, which included a safety catch, has been highlighted as posing considerable complication. Climate control within the cockpit was also reportedly a less-than-desirable state of affairs.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1982, Teague {{worked on}} the first large cars sold by AMC since 1978, the front-drive sedan code named X-58, for {{introduction}} in late-1986. and a companion code named X-59, that was to debut for the 1988 model year. He achieved a <b>roomy</b> interior in an aerodynamic design, and the two-door model was to have featured hidden headlamps, but the coupe was never produced. Giorgetto Giugiaro penned the sharper-edged exterior design for the four-door sedan that went into production as the Eagle Premier.|$|E
