40|$|Abstract — Coding the payload {{data and}} sending the {{codeword}} as an overhead of the packet {{is a very}} common way to protect data in communication networks. The protection level of the coding technique is chosen depending {{on the importance of}} the transmitted data. While high priority, safety critical applications do not tolerate any single bit error in data packets, lower priority services can handle few bit errors. Coding techniques provide error detection and up to a certain level also error correction. Bit errors that are not detectable by coding techniques at the receiver side occur with a <b>residual</b> <b>error</b> <b>probability.</b> The better the coding technique is, the lower is its <b>residual</b> <b>error</b> <b>probability</b> for different bit error rates. Most automotive network systems use Cyclic Redundancy Codes (CRC) mainly in order to detect transmission bit errors. Instead of correcting the identified bit errors which is quite time consuming, usually a retransmission of the damaged data packet is triggered. Similar to automotive network systems, Ethernet, the most applied network technology in local area networks uses the CRC error detection technique. In this work, we present a comparative study of the error detection capabilities of automotive network systems and Ethernet as a possible network system for time critical applications in the car. We evaluate the related residual error probabilities for a reasonable range of bit error rates. Furthermore, several commercial concepts are presented from the automation field that increase the error detection capability of the standard Ethernet technology significantly. I...|$|E
40|$|Software {{engineers}} are humans {{and so they}} make lots of mistakes. Typically 1 out of 10 to 100 tasks go wrong. The only way to avoid these mistakes is to introduce redundancy in the software engineering process. This article is a plea to consciously introduce several levels of redundancy for each programming task. Depending on the required level of correctness, expressed in a <b>residual</b> <b>error</b> <b>probability</b> (typically 10 - 3 to 10 - 10), each programming task {{must be carried out}} redundantly 4 to 8 times. This number is hardly influenced by the size of a programming endeavour. Training software engineers does have some effect as non trained software engineers require a double amount of redundant tasks to deliver software of a desired quality. More compact programming, for instance by using domain specific languages, only reduces the number of redundant tasks by a small constant...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} error {{correction}} for Gallager's low-density parity-check codes is famously {{equivalent to that}} of computing marginal Boltzmann probabilities for an Ising-like model with multispin interactions in a non-uniform magnetic field. Since the graph of interactions is locally a tree, the solution is very well approximated by a generalized mean-field (Bethe-Peierls) approximation. Belief propagation (BP) and similar iterative algorithms are {{an efficient way to}} perform the calculation, but they sometimes fail to converge, or converge to non-codewords, giving rise to a non-negligible <b>residual</b> <b>error</b> <b>probability</b> (error floor). On the other hand, provably-convergent algorithms are far too complex to be implemented in a real decoder. In this work we consider the application of the probability-damping technique, which can be regarded either as a variant of BP, from which it retains the property of low complexity, or as an approximation of a provably-convergent algorithm, from which it is expected to inherit better convergence properties. We investigate the algorithm behaviour on a real instance of Gallager code, and compare the results with state-of-the-art algorithms.

40|$|Safety {{integrity}} level (SIL) {{verification of}} functional safety fieldbus communication {{is an essential}} part of SIL verification of safety instrumented system (SIS), and it requires quantifying <b>residual</b> <b>error</b> <b>probability</b> (RP) and residual error rate of function safety communication. The present quantification method of residual error rate uses RP of cyclic redundancy check (CRC) to approximately replace the total RP of functional safety communication. Since CRC only detects data integrity-related errors and CRC has intrinsically undetected error, some other residual errors are not being considered. This research found some residual errors of the present quantification method. Then, this research presents an extended new approach, which takes the found residual errors into account to determine more comprehensive and reasonable RP and residual error rate. From perspective of the composition of safety message, this research studies RPs of those controlling segments (sequence number, time expectation, etc.) to cover the found residual errors beyond CRC detection coverage, and the influences of insertion/masquerade errors and time window on RP are investigated. The results turn out these residual errors, especially insertion/masquerade errors, may have a great influence on quantification of residual error rate and SIL verification of functional safety communication, and they should be treated seriously...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{report on}} a strong {{capacity}} boost in storing digital data in synthetic DNA. In principle, synthetic DNA is an ideal media to archive digital data for very long times because the achievable data density and longevity outperforms today's digital data storage media by far. On the other hand, neither the synthesis, nor the amplification and the sequencing of DNA strands can be performed error-free today and in the foreseeable future. In order to make synthetic DNA available as digital data storage media, specifically tailored forward error correction schemes have to be applied. For the purpose of realizing a DNA data storage, we have developed an efficient and robust forwarderror-correcting scheme adapted to the DNA channel. We based {{the design of the}} needed DNA channel model on data from a proof-of-concept conducted 2012 by a team from the Harvard Medical School [1]. Our forward error correction scheme is able to cope with all error types of today's DNA synthesis, amplification and sequencing processes, e. g. insertion, deletion, and swap errors. In a successful experiment, we were able to store and retrieve error-free 22 MByte of digital data in synthetic DNA recently. The found <b>residual</b> <b>error</b> <b>probability</b> is already in the same order as it is in hard disk drives and can be easily improved further.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between two ideas in network information theory: edge removal and strong converses. Edge removal properties state that if an edge of small capacity is removed from a network, the capacity region does not change too much. Strong converses state that, for rates outside the capacity region, the probability of error converges to 1. Various notions of edge removal and strong converse are defined, depending on how edge capacity and <b>residual</b> <b>error</b> <b>probability</b> scale with blocklength, and relations between them are proved. In particular, each class of strong converse implies a specific class of edge removal. The opposite directions are proved for deterministic networks. Furthermore, a technique based on a novel, causal version of the blowing-up lemma is used to prove that for discrete memoryless stationary networks, the weak edge removal property [...] -that the capacity region changes continuously as the capacity of an edge vanishes [...] -is equivalent to the exponentially strong converse [...] -that outside the capacity region, the probability of error goes to 1 exponentially fast. This result is used to prove exponentially strong converses for several examples [...] -including the cut-set bound and the discrete 2 -user interference channel with strong interference [...] -with only a small variation from traditional weak converse proofs.

40|$|Algebraic {{decoding}} algorithms {{are commonly}} {{applied for the}} decoding of Reed-Solomon codes. Their main advantages are low computational complexity and predictable decoding capabilities. Many algorithms can be extended for correction of both errors and erasures. This enables the decoder to exploit binary quantized reliability information obtained from the transmission channel: Received symbols with high reliability are forwarded to the decoding algorithm while symbols with low reliability are erased. In this paper we investigate adaptive single-trial error/erasure decoding of Reed-Solomon codes, i. e. we derive an adaptive erasing strategy which minimizes the <b>residual</b> codeword <b>error</b> <b>probability</b> after decoding. Our result is applicable to any error/erasure decoding algorithm as long as its decoding capabilities can be expressed by a decoder capability function. Examples are Bounded Minimum Distance decoding with the Berlekamp-Massey- or the Sugiyama algorithms and the Guruswami-Sudan list decoder.

40|$|The symbol error {{performance}} of CD 900 -like digital {{cellular mobile radio}} systems over narrowband and urban wideband transmission channels was investigated. The basic performance is presented for Gaussian, flat-fading Rayleigh, and log-normal channels {{in the presence of}} selection and ratio combining space diversity schemes. For wideband channels having more than one resolvable fading path, a CD 900 -like system without diversity reception suffers from large <b>residual</b> symbol <b>error</b> <b>probabilities</b> PR(≈ 10 - 1). The introduction of adaptive correlation diversity (ACD) mitigates the effects of multipath, yielding a PR of 6 × 10 - 5. Although this PR value is relatively low, the <b>probability</b> of symbol <b>error</b> (Pe) versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is significantly poorer than for the Gaussian channel. By combining the ACD scheme with space diversity, the PR is eliminated by Pe > 10 - 5, and the channel SNR is within 5 dB of the Gaussian channel performance when Pe is 10 - 10. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, multi-trial error/erasure {{decoding}} of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes {{is based}} on Bounded Minimum Distance (BMD) decoders with an erasure option. Such decoders have error/erasure tradeoff factor L= 2, which means that an error is twice as expensive as an erasure {{in terms of the}} code's minimum distance. The Guruswami-Sudan (GS) list decoder can be considered as state of the art in algebraic decoding of RS codes. Besides an erasure option, it allows to adjust L to values in the range 1 = 1 times. We show that BMD decoders with z_BMD decoding trials can result in lower <b>residual</b> codeword <b>error</b> <b>probability</b> than GS decoders with z_GS trials, if z_BMD is only slightly larger than z_GS. This is of practical interest since BMD decoders generally have lower computational complexity than GS decoders.

40|$|We {{investigate}} adaptive single-trial error/erasure decoding of binary codes whose decoder is able {{to correct}} e errors and t erasures if le+t<=d- 1. Thereby, d is the minimum Hamming distance of the code and 1 <l<= 2 is the tradeoff parameter between errors and erasures. The error/erasure decoder allows to exploit soft information by treating a set of most unreliable received symbols as erasures. The obvious question here is, how this erasing should be performed, i. e. how the unreliable symbols which must be erased to obtain the smallest possible <b>residual</b> codeword <b>error</b> <b>probability</b> are determined. In a previous paper, we answer this question for the case of fixed erasing, where only the channel state and not the individual symbol reliabilities are taken into consideration. In this paper, we address the adaptive case, where the optimal erasing strategy is determined for every given received vector.

This is a generalization of Forney's GMD decoding, which was considered only for L = 1, i. e. outer Bounded Minimum Distance decoding. One important example for (L+ 1) /L-extended Bounded Distance decoders is decoding of L-Interleaved Reed-Solomon codes. Our main contribution is a threshold location formula, which allows to optimally erase unreliable inner decoding results, for a given number of decoding trials and parameter L. Thereby, the term optimal means that the <b>residual</b> codeword <b>error</b> <b>probability</b> of the concatenated code is minimized.

The behavior of cracks locations and sizes on vibration parameters is presented taking {{the advantage of}} reduction in stiffness of shaft from fracture mechanics. The shaft is subjected to static axial and bending load for given angle of twist along its longitudinal direction. Using the principle strain energy release rate and stress intensity factor (for plain stress and strain condition), the natural frequencies with their mode shapes at different crack locations with its depths are evaluated. The result obtained from theoretical method has been verified with the advantage of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) using the modal parameter of cracked shaft. The vibration parameters such as first three non-dimensional natural frequencies with their mode shapes at different locations and depths are supplied to ANFIS to optimize the results.
