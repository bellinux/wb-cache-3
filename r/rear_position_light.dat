25|$|Conspicuity for {{the rear}} of a vehicle is {{provided}} by <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> lamps (also called tail lamps or tail lights). These are required to produce only red light and to be wired such that they are lit whenever the front position lamps are lit, including when the headlamps are on. <b>Rear</b> <b>position</b> lamps may be combined with the vehicle's stop lamps or separate from them. In combined-function installations, the lamps produce brighter red light for the stop lamp function and dimmer red <b>light</b> for the <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> lamp function. Regulations worldwide stipulate minimum intensity ratios between the bright (stop) and dim (<b>rear</b> <b>position)</b> modes, so that a vehicle displaying <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> lamps will not be mistakenly interpreted as showing stop lamps, and vice versa.|$|R

40|$|One {{of major}} sources of air {{pollution}} {{is the result of}} combustion exhaust gases of automotive engines. As it is known that the process of fuel combustion from motor fuel produces exhaust gases which theoretically contain elements of CO, NO x, HC, CO 2, H 2 O and N 2, where many of which are polluting the surrounding environment in the form of air pollution.  The use of LPG fuel for gasoline engine can be done by adding a piece of equipment called a conversion kit.  In this study the fuel in the LPG gas injected in the intake manifold with some variation of spin injection with 3000  rpm, 4500 rpm and 6000 rpm for each transmision rate (Neutral s / d Gear 4).  The result showed that the injection of fuel gas LPG in the <b>rear</b> <b>position</b> (P 3) in getting a decrease in fuel Consumtion (FC) is optimal compared to other injection position (P 1, P 2).

Light-bearers can assume either a frontal or <b>rear</b> <b>position.</b> While they take the frontal position, they participate in battle whilst controlling the lighthouses.

30|$|Even though {{driving into}} sidings/the depot is a {{frequent}} task for drivers working shifts around rush hours, it {{does not account for}} a significant percentage of their shift. Hence, when the large percentage of all category A SPaDs and the low percentage of the shift spent in these locations are considered, this suggests that there are issues {{in the design of the}} locations and operational procedures. The signalling is the main difference at the depot and the sidings compared to the rest of the network with the majority of the signals being ground <b>position</b> <b>lights.</b> Even though the majority of the drivers disagree with added complexity of those locations and ground <b>position</b> <b>lights,</b> they gave this type of signals the lowest mark. Moreover, participants’ involvement in category A SPaDs does not influence the attitudes of the drivers towards the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> (U =  28, p =  0.663). The respondents mention that the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> are hard to see at times due to low brightness and a poor choice of location. It is possible that the drivers do not see any hazard in this type of signalling in the context of day-to-day driving. However, when compared with different types of signals, they perceive the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> as the hardest to interact with. It is also possible that the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> are the hardest to interact with in the beginning of a shift before driving in passenger service.|$|R

50|$|In 1954, the PRR experimented {{installing}} red lenses in {{the horizontal}} {{position of the}} upper head to help increase the at distance visibility of absolute Stop signals at Overbrook interlocking. Under the Penn Central and later Conrail it became standard practice to add these red lenses to high <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> and even some pedestal signals. The Norfolk and Western modified its signals to use red and green lenses in the upper head Stop and Clear positions and yellow lenses everywhere else. In the 1980s Amtrak modified most of its former-PRR <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> to use the equivalent color light colors {{in all of the}} positions of both heads.
