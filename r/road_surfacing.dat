The change of the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> conditions can have significant influence on {{the safety of a}} running vehicle on the road. Nowadays, {{there are a lot of}} CCTVs that are installed to observe the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> with the unaided eye, and it is common for an administrator to determine the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> conditions after confirming visually. However, there is a limitation to quickly determine the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> conditions manually. Thus there is a need for developing a technology that can automatically determine the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> based on images. In this paper, a recognition algorithm was proposed to extract the state of <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> conditions based on images obtained by a vision camera, and empirical experiment was conducted. The <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> conditions were classified using histogram and wavelet filter based on the proposed algorithm. In order to verify the recognition algorithm, the asphalt road was recorded and a variety of <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> conditions such as dry, snow, ice and wet was utilized as the input data. First, the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> condition was distinguished into dry and wet using polarization coefficient, and then the dry condition was distinguished into dry and ice using wavelet and frequency characteristic.

In this paper, the <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> states are categorized into 5 types including dry, wet, snow, ice, and water.

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>surfaces</b> made of {{porous asphalt}} {{are widely used}} to reduce the tire-road-noise {{generated}} during the rolling process of passenger cars and trucks. As the engine noise was reduced significantly in the last decades the tire-road-noise is the main sound source for driving speeds of 40 kmph (25 mph) and higher for passenger cars. This means that low noise <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> may not only be used on highways but also on inner-city main roads to generate a significant reduction on traffic noise. However, the acoustic performance of <b>road</b> <b>surfaces</b> made of porous asphalt is limited {{as a result of}} the trade-off between acoustic properties and <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> durability. By including resonators e. g. of Helmholtz type in the porous <b>road</b> <b>surface</b> it is possible to improve its absorbing performance without loss in durability.
