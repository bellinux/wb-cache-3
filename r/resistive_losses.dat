30|$|From the {{attenuation}} coefficient α shown in Table  2, the <b>resistive</b> <b>loss</b> in the 150 MHz case {{is larger than}} that in the 13.56 MHz case. However, the <b>resistive</b> <b>loss</b> only causes a monotonic decay in voltage amplitude from the driving point along the wave-propagation direction. Since Figure 5 does not show a monotonic decay in voltage from the driving point, the drastic change in the voltage pattern in the 150 MHz case {{is considered to be}} caused mainly by the standing wave effect.|$|R
50|$|Shunt {{conductance}} {{per unit}} length, in siemens per metre. The shunt conductance is usually very small because insulators with good dielectric properties are used (a very low loss tangent). At high frequencies, a dielectric {{can have a}} significant <b>resistive</b> <b>loss.</b>|$|R
40|$|Practical {{solar cells}} require larger active areas than {{ones in the}} R&D stage in laboratories. However, the {{enlargement}} lowers conversion efficiency because of the following two reasons: (1) increase of <b>resistive</b> <b>loss</b> in the transparent conductive electrode caused by the longer distance for the photogenerated carriers to pass and (2) active area loss caused by shadows of collector electrodes laid on to reduce the previous <b>resistive</b> <b>loss.</b> In the present study, we have constructed an advisable modeling method to calculate output power of medium-sized solar cells and optimized geometry of the collector electrodes. Results of the modeling taught us a possible improvement of the output power by over 10 %. These simulated results were reproduced by electrochemical experiments...|$|R
25|$|The {{equivalent}} {{series resistance}} (ESR) summarizes all <b>resistive</b> <b>losses</b> of the capacitor.

25|$|The {{equivalent}} {{series resistance}} (ESR) summarizes all <b>resistive</b> <b>losses</b> of the capacitor. These are the supply line resistances, the contact resistance of the electrode contact, the line resistance of the electrodes and the dielectric losses in the dielectric film. The largest share of these losses is usually the dissipative losses in the dielectric.|$|E
25|$|Because {{electrical}} power {{is equal to}} voltage times current, the relatively low voltages in existing DC systems imply relatively high currents. If the DC power in the contact wire is to be supplied directly to the DC traction motors, minimizing <b>resistive</b> <b>losses</b> requires thick, short supply cables/wires and closely spaced converter stations.|$|E
50|$|The Nernst {{equation}} also only applies {{when there}} is no net current flow through the electrode. The activity of ions at the electrode surface changes {{when there is}} current flow, and there are additional overpotential and <b>resistive</b> <b>loss</b> terms which contribute to the measured potential.|$|R
5000|$|Quality of a {{receiver}} {{is defined by}} its sensitivity and selectivity. For a single-tank TRF (tuned radio frequency) receiver without regenerative feedback, , where Q is tank [...] "quality" [...] defined as , Z is reactive impedance, R is <b>resistive</b> <b>loss.</b> Signal voltage at tank is antenna voltage multiplied by Q.|$|R

2500|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} in measuring these parameters directly, other parameters are substituted: thermodynamic efficiency, quantum efficiency, integrated quantum efficiency, VOC ratio, and fill factor. Reflectance losses are a portion of quantum efficiency under [...] "external quantum efficiency". Recombination losses make up another portion of quantum efficiency, VOC ratio, and fill factor. <b>Resistive</b> <b>losses</b> are predominantly categorized under fill factor, but also make up minor portions of quantum efficiency, VOC ratio.|$|E
2500|$|Capacitors {{with very}} low losses, such as ceramic Class 1 and Class 2 {{capacitors}}, specify <b>resistive</b> <b>losses</b> with a quality factor (Q). Ceramic Class 1 capacitors are especially suitable for LC resonant circuits with frequencies {{up to the}} GHz range, and precise high and low pass filters. For an electrically resonant system, Q represents the effect of electrical resistance and characterizes a resonator's bandwidth [...] relative to its center or resonant frequency [...] Q {{is defined as the}} reciprocal value of the dissipation factor.|$|E
2500|$|Several factors {{affect a}} cell's {{conversion}} efficiency value, including its reflectance efficiency, thermodynamic efficiency, charge carrier separation efficiency, and conduction efficiency values. Because these parameters {{can be difficult}} to measure directly, other parameters are measured instead, including quantum efficiency, VOC ratio, and fill factor. Reflectance losses are accounted for by the quantum efficiency value, as they affect [...] "external quantum efficiency." [...] Recombination losses are accounted for by the quantum efficiency, VOC ratio, and fill factor values. <b>Resistive</b> <b>losses</b> are predominantly accounted for by the fill factor value, but also contribute to the quantum efficiency and VOC ratio values.|$|E
40|$|The a. c. {{self-field}} loss in Bi(2223) Ag sheathed tapes {{with different}} number of filaments has been measured between 59 and 2500 Hz {{by means of}} a dual lock-in amplifier. Due to the wide frequency range of the measurements {{we have been able to}} dissociate quantitatively the different self-field loss contributions: hysteretic, eddy current and <b>resistive</b> <b>loss</b> (near Ic). This is an important advantage compared to single frequency measurements where such loss dissociation is only qualitative. The hysteresis losses of the different tapes fall between Norris’ predictions for elliptical and strip cross section. The relative weight of eddy current loss is found to be inversely proportional to the current ratio – the higher i, the less is their contribution. Frequency independent <b>resistive</b> <b>loss</b> due to flux creep is observed for high currents at low frequencies; this loss becomes quickly negligible with the increasing frequency...|$|R

50|$|At low speeds {{the heating}} of the coils dominates the {{percentage}} {{efficiency of the}} coilgun, giving exceptionally low efficiency. However, as speeds climb, mechanical power grows proportional to the speed, but, correctly switched, the <b>resistive</b> <b>losses</b> are largely unaffected, and thus these <b>resistive</b> <b>losses</b> become much smaller in percentage terms.|$|E
5000|$|Usually the <b>resistive</b> <b>losses</b> grow {{proportionately to}} [...] and {{dielectric}} losses grow proportionately to [...] with ge > 0.5 so {{at a high}} enough frequency, dielectric losses will exceed <b>resistive</b> <b>losses.</b> In practice, before that point is reached, a transmission line with a better dielectric is used. In long distance rigid coaxial cable, to get very low dielectric losses, the solid dielectric may be replaced by air with plastic spacers at intervals to keep the center conductor on axis.|$|E

50|$|With the {{widespread}} establishment of electrical grids, power transmission is usually associated most with electric power transmission. Alternating current is normally preferred as its voltage may be easily stepped up by a transformer {{in order to}} minimize <b>resistive</b> <b>loss</b> in the conductors used to transmit power over great distances; another set of transformers is required to step it back down to safer or more usable voltage levels at destination.|$|R
50|$|Above {{the cut-off}} (f > fc), the {{impedance}} is real (resistive) and the wave carries energy. Below cut-off the impedance is imaginary (reactive) and the wave is evanescent. These expressions neglect {{the effect of}} <b>resistive</b> <b>loss</b> in {{the walls of the}} waveguide. For a waveguide entirely filled with a homogeneous dielectric medium, similar expressions apply, but with the wave impedance of the medium replacing Z0.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of the surface oxide layer {{thickness}} of a Pb-free solder (Sn 3. 4 Ag 0. 8 Cu) and pure Sn on high frequency signal propagation have been investigated. To simulate the thermal effects induced by extended device powering, the Pb-free materials were annealed at 200 0 C for different times (up to 30 days) to increase the oxide layer thickness. The test modules consisting of lead-free microstrip lines (pure tin and SnAgCu) on a low-loss liquid crystal polymer substrate were fabricated and measured up to 50 GHz. The insertion losses of thick and native oxides were compared using transmission line theory. The results were in good agreement with the predictions, and the comparison of the insertion losses of different oxide thicknesses pointed out that the natural oxide layers induce less <b>resistive</b> <b>loss</b> than the annealed materials at microwave frequencies. It was evaluated that the <b>resistive</b> <b>loss</b> of the highly oxidized pure Sn was 0. 6 dB/cm larger than that of its native oxide layer.
