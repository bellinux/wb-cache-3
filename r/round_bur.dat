For instance a latch type, or right angle bur, is only used in the slow speed handpiece with contra-angle attachment. Long shank or shaft is only used in the slow speed when the contra-angle is not in use, and finally a friction grip bur, which is a small bur, is used only in the high-speed handpiece.|$|E
50|$|In 1921, T.P. Hyatt, {{a pioneer}} researcher, {{was the first}} person to {{recommend}} prophylactic odontotomy (preventive operation). This procedure involved creating Class 1 cavity preps of teeth that were considered at risk of developing occlusal caries, which included all pits and fissures. The widening of the pits and fissures were then filled with amalgam. C.F Bödecker, a dentist and researcher, also made attempts to prevent occlusal caries. Initially, in 1926 Bödecker would use a large <b>round</b> <b>bur</b> to smooth out the fissures. 1929, Bödecker attempted to prevent occlusal caries by cleaning the pit and fissures with an explorer and then sealing the pits and fissures with dental cement, such as oxyphosphate cement.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the periodontal bone defects created only mechanically and by combined mechanical and chemical techniques. Materials and Methods: The samples comprised 24 hemi-mandibles from pigs, which were allocated into 3 groups; G 1 (before acid application), G 2 (after acid application and G 3 (without bone defect and acid treatment). Periodontal bone defects were created with <b>round</b> <b>burs</b> between the second and third pre-molar. The radiographs were taken using the Visualix eHD sensor. The central ray was perpendicular to the sensor and to the hemi-mandible at a 40 cm focal-spot to sensor distance (settings 70 kVp, 10 mA and 15 impulses). After the defects were created in groups G 1 and G 2, they were treated with 100 % perchloric acid for 48 hours. Images were zoomed to the level of 125 % and interpreted by three examiners. Sensitivity and specificity were computed for the detection of periodontal bone defects with acid application and created using only <b>round</b> <b>burs.</b> The examiner's radiographic interpretation produced a diagnosis based on a five-point confidence scale. If the interpretation received the scores 1 or 2, it was concluded that no bone defect was present, whereas the scores 3, 4, or 5 were considered to reflect evidence of a bone defect. Results: There was no difference between groups G 1 (Sen - 95 %CI= 0. 9167; Spec - 95 %CI= 0. 9167) and G 2 (Sen - 95 %CI= 0. 8333; Spec - 95 %CI= 0. 9167).

Within the limitations of this study, laser fluorescence measured with DIAGNOdent does not correlate well with extent of carious tooth structure in incipient occlusal caries. Clinicians should not rely only on DIAGNOdent readings to determine the extension of incipient occlusal caries. (J Esthet Restor Dent 22 : 31 – 41, 2010...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{antimicrobial}} activity of 5. 25 % NaOCl, Hypoclean and Chlor-Xtra at 20 °C and 45 °C in bovine root dentin. One-hundred-and-seventy dentin tubes prepared from bovine maxillary incisors were infected for 21 days with Enterococcus faecalis. The specimens were divided into the following groups: 1. 5. 25 % NaOCl 20 °C; 2. Hypoclean 20 °C; 3. Chlor-Xtra 20 °C; 4. 5. 25 % % NaOCl 45 °C; 5. Hypoclean 45 °C; 6. Chlor-Xtra 45 °C; 7. positive control; 8. negative control. Dentin chips were collected with <b>round</b> <b>burs</b> into Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth. After culturing, the number of colony-forming units (CFU) was counted. Statistical analyses were performed using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median), Shapiro-Wilk test, ANOVA and Tukey test. Significance level was set at p< 0. 05. In all experimental groups, CFU was minimum after treatment (day 0) and the obtained results were significantly different from each other at any period (p< 0. 05). After treatment, the Hypoclean and Chlor-Xtra showed the lowest numbers of CFU at 20 °C and 45 °C, whereas 5. 25 % NaOCl showed the highest number of CFU at both temperatures. In each group, the number of CFUs increased significantly with time (p< 0. 05). The antibacterial activity of Hypoclean and Chlor-Xtra at 45 °C were significantly greater than other tested solutions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to compare microleakage after root end {{resection}} of the two materials (MTA and Biodentine) for two different apical cavity preparation using the method of penetration of dye- 0, 2 % Rodamine B. Ma-terials and Methods: Forty-eight extracted single-rooted human teeth were used in this study. The resection was made at 3 mm from the root tip with a high speed diamond bur at an angle of 90 degree to the long axis of the tooth. For the retrofilling, ProRoot MTA and Biodentine were used. The teeth were divided into 5 groups: 1 st group (10 teeth) – the apical cavity was prepared with stainless steel fissure bur # 10 at 3 mm depth in the root canal parallel to the long axis of the tooth and is filled retrograde with MTA. 3 rd group (10 teeth) - retrofilling with Biodentine. 2 nd group (10 teeth) -with a <b>round</b> <b>bur</b> apical cavity was prepared with a concav...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: This {{study is}} {{performed}} {{to determine the}} effects of titanium cap with various sizes of pores on bone formation during guided bone regeneration (GBR). Methods: Calvaria from 10 adult male rabbits were chosen as the recipient sites. A trephine bur with a diameter of 10 mm was used to form one round groove on each side of sagittal suture of the cranium, and a <b>round</b> <b>bur</b> with a diameter of 1. 5 mm was used to form 6 small holes on the inner circles of round grooves to induce bleeding. In the control group, bone graft was not conducted, and closed titanium cap was fixed in the round groove. Bone graft was not performed in groups 1 and 2, but fixed on titanium caps with 0. 2 mm, and 0. 5 mm sized pores, respectively. For groups 3, 4, and 5, a synthetic bone graft material (β-tricalcium phosphate, CerasorbⓇ, Germany) was transplanted, and titanium caps without pore, with 0. 2 mm and 0. 5 mm sized pore were fixed, respectively. The animals were sacrificed 4 weeks after, and clinical, radiographical, and histomorphometrical evaluation of bone regeneration was performed...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} goals of preradicular surgery {{is to create a}} good apical seal. This can be done by {{sectioning}} approximately one third of the apex, preparation of a class I cavity, and filling with a biocompatible material. The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare crack propagation in retro filling with two commercially available amalgams. Thirty-four extracted single rooted teeth were divided into two groups. After instrumentation and filling with Gutta percha by lateral condensation method, three millimeter of apex was resected and retro preparations were done by a low speed hand piece and '/&gt; <b>round</b> <b>bur.</b> Then cavities were filled with cinalloy and luxalloy amalgam in-group &quot;one&quot; and &quot;two&quot; respectively. The surface of resected root ends was examined in two stages, after doing retro preparation and retro filling and the presence of any cracks or structural changes was inspected by stereomicroscope 50 x. Regard to number and type of cracks, the result of this study showed that {{there was no significant difference}} between cinalloy or luxalloy retro fillings. By considering the conditions of this study, cinalloy amalgam can be used as a retro filling material...|$|E

The purpose of this in vitro study {{was to assess the}} effect of hydrogen peroxide on the antibacterial substantivity of chlorhexidine (CHX). Seventy-five dentine tubes prepared from human maxillary central and lateral incisor teeth were used. After contamination with Enterococcus faecalis for 14 days, the specimens were divided into five groups as follows: CHX, H 2 O 2,CHX+H 2 O 2, infected dentine tubes (positive control), and sterile dentine tubes (negative control). Dentine chips were collected with <b>round</b> <b>burs</b> into tryptic soy broth, and after culturing, the number of colony-forming units (CFU) was counted. The number of CFU was minimum in the first cultures in all experimental groups, and the results obtained were significantly different from each other at any time period (P <. 05). At the first culture, the number of CFU in the CHX + H 2 O 2 group was lower than other two groups. At the other experimental periods, the CHX group showed the most effective antibacterial action (P <. 05). Hydrogen peroxide group showed the worst result at all periods. In each group, the number of CFU increased significantly by time lapse (P <. 05). In conclusion, H 2 O 2 had no additive effect on the residual antibacterial activity of CHX. 1...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the in vitro antimicrobial activity of Brazilian brown propolis as an intracanal medication against Enterococcus faecalis. Thirty dentin discs prepared from intact freshly extracted bovine maxillary central incisors were infected with E. faecalis for 21 days. The specimens were distributed into six groups according to the medicament used as follows: G 1 - calcium hydroxide paste; G 2 - Carbowax 400 (control group); G 3 - 20 % brown propolis paste; G 4 - 40 % brown propolis paste; G 5 - 20 % brown propolis paste + calcium hydroxide paste; and G 6 - 40 % brown propolis paste + calcium hydroxide paste. The experimental pastes were placed into the canal lumen and left for 14 days. After each period, irrigation was performed with sterile saline to remove the medicament, and the canals were dried with sterile paper points. The dentin chips were removed from the canals with sequential sterile <b>round</b> <b>burs</b> at low speed and were immediately collected in separate test tubes containing BHI broth. The tubes were incubated at 37 °C, and microbial growth was analyzed by spectrophotometry after 15 days. All the experimental medications significantly reduced the number of viable bacteria. The G 4 and G 5 pastes were more effective than the G 1 paste, with 35. 8 %, 41 %, and 21. 3 % antibacterial activity, respectively.
