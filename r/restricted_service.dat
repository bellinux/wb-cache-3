25|$|IRNSS is an {{independent}} regional navigation satellite system being developed by India. It {{is designed to provide}} accurate position information service to users in India as well as the region extending up to 1500km from its boundary, which is its primary service area. IRNSS will provide two types of services, namely, Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and <b>Restricted</b> <b>Service</b> (RS) and is expected to provide a position accuracy of better than 20m in the primary service area.

The requirement of such a navigation system is driven by the fact that access to Global Navigation Satellite Systems like GPS is not guaranteed in hostile situations. ISRO initially planned to launch the constellation of satellites between 2012 and 2014 but the project got delayed by nearly 2 years.|$|E
