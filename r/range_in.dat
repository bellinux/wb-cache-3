5|$|Bat {{echolocation}} is a perceptual {{system where}} ultrasonic sounds are emitted specifically to produce echoes. By comparing the outgoing pulse with the returning echoes, {{the brain and}} auditory nervous system can produce detailed images of the bat's surroundings. This allows bats to detect, localize, and even classify their prey in complete darkness. Bat calls {{are some of the}} most intense, airborne animal sounds, and can <b>range</b> <b>in</b> intensity from between 60 and 140 decibels. Microbats use their larynx to create ultrasound, and emit the sound through their mouth and sometimes their nose. The latter is most pronounced in the horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus spp.). Microbat calls <b>range</b> <b>in</b> frequency from 14,000 to well over 100,000Hz, extending beyond the range of human hearing (between 20 and 20,000Hz).|$|E

5|$|R. s. annamiticus, {{known as}} the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros, Rhinoceros sondaicus annamiticu or Vietnamese rhinoceros, once lived across South China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia.
