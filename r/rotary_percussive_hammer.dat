40|$|Drill & Blast is a {{commonly}} used excavation method {{for the construction}} of underground openings (e. g. tunnels, caverns) in hardrock conditions worldwide. Wear of the employed tools may take place during dif-ferent steps of the working cycle, affecting a wide range of machinery and materials. Although excavators, dump trucks or conveyor belts are also permanently exposed to the excavated rock mass and therefore un-dergoing geologically influenced wear, the wear of the rock cutting tools (i. e. drilling bits, excavator chisels, picks) is the most expensive wear phenomenon. Drilling equipment and bit tool wear Common blasthole diameters range from 38 to 48 mm and are typically drilled by use of hydraulic <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> drilling <b>hammers</b> (impact power of about 15 to 20 kW). In most geological conditions, predomi-nantly button bits are used which consist of a number of cemented carbide buttons inserted and/or solded into holes of a steel body (Figure 1). The properties of the button bit can be adjusted effectively to the local cir-cumstances by variation of the amount of inserted buttons, button composition, button geometry, solding and steel quality or the bit's flushing system.

40|$|This work is {{a method}} to drill into a rock surface {{regardless}} of the gravitational field or orientation. The required weight-on-bit (WOB) is supplied by a self-contained anchoring mechanism. The system includes a <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> coring drill, forming a complete sampling instrument usable by robot or human. This method of in situ sample acquisition using micro - spine anchoring technology enables several NASA mission concepts not currently possible with existing technology, including sampling from consolidated rock on asteroids, providing a bolt network for astronauts visiting a near-Earth asteroid, and sampling from the ceilings or vertical walls of lava tubes and cliff faces on Mars. One {{of the most fundamental}} parameters of drilling is the WOB; essentially, the load applied to the bit that allows it to cut, creating a reaction force normal to the surface. In every drilling application, there is a minimum WOB that must be maintained for the system to function properly. In microgravity (asteroids and comets), even a small WOB could not be supported conventionally by the weight of the robot or astronaut. An anchoring mechanism would be needed to resist the reactions, or the robot or astronaut would push themselves off the surface and into space. The ability of the system to anchor itself to a surface creates potential applications that reach beyond use in low gravity. The use of these anchoring mechanisms as end effectors on climbing robots has the potential of vastly expanding the scope of what is considered accessible terrain. Further, because the drill is supported by its own anchor rather than by a robotic arm, the workspace is not constrained by the reach of such an arm. Yet, if the drill is on a robotic arm, it has the benefit of not reflecting the forces of drilling back to the arm s joints. Combining the drill with the anchoring feet will create a highly mobile, highly stable, and highly reliable system. The drilling system s anchor uses hundreds of microspine toes that independently find holes and ledges on a rock to create an anchor. Once the system is anchored, a linear translation mechanism moves the drill axially into the surface while maintaining the proper WOB. The linear translation mechanism is composed of a ball screw and stepper motor that can translate a carriage with high precision and applied load. The carriage slides along rails using self-aligning linear bearings that correct any axial misalignment caused by bending and torsion. The carriage then compresses a series of springs that simultaneously transmit the load to the drill along the bit axis and act as a suspension that compensates for the vibration caused by percussive drilling. The drill is a compacted, modified version of an off-the-shelf <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> drill, which uses a custom carbide-tipped coring bit. By using <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> drilling, the drill time is greatly reduced. The percussive action fractures the rock debris, which is removed during rotation. The final result is a 0. 75 -in. (. 1. 9 - cm) diameter hole and a preserved 0. 5 - in. (. 1. 3 -cm) diameter rock core. This work extends microspine technology, making it applicable to astronaut missions to asteroids and a host of robotic sampling concepts. At the time of this reporting, it is the first instrument to be demonstrated using microspine anchors, and is the first self-contained drill/anchor system to be demonstrated that is capable of drilling in inverted configurations and would be capable of drilling in microgravity...|$|R
40|$|A system {{consisting}} {{of a set of}} estimators and autonomous behaviors has been developed which allows robust coring from a low-mass rover platform, while accommodating for moderate rover slip. A redundant set of sensors, including a force-torque sensor, visual odometry, and accelerometers are used to monitor discrete critical and operational modes, as well as to estimate continuous drill parameters during the coring process. A set of critical failure modes pertinent to shallow coring from a mobile platform is defined, and autonomous behaviors associated with each critical mode are used to maintain nominal coring conditions.

40|$|The term "rotary percussive auto-gopher" denotes a {{proposed}} {{addition to a}} family of apparatuses, based on ultrasonic/ sonic drill corers (USDCs), that have been described in numerous previous NASA Tech Briefs articles. These apparatuses have been designed, variously, for boring into, and/or acquiring samples of, rock or other hard, brittle materials of geological interest. In {{the case of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> autogopher, the emphasis would be on developing an apparatus capable of penetrating to, and acquiring samples at, depths that could otherwise be reached only by use of much longer, heavier, conventional drilling-and-sampling apparatuses. To recapitulate from the prior articles about USDCs: A USDC can be characterized as a lightweight, low-power jackhammer in which a piezoelectrically driven actuator generates ultrasonic vibrations and is coupled to a tool bit through a free mass. The bouncing of the free mass between the actuator horn and the drill bit converts the actuator ultrasonic vibrations into sonic hammering of the drill bit. The combination of ultrasonic and sonic vibrations gives rise to a hammering action (and a resulting chiseling action {{at the tip of the}} tool bit) that is more effective for drilling than is the microhammering action of ultrasonic vibrations alone. The hammering and chiseling actions are so effective that the size of the axial force needed to make the tool bit advance into soil, rock, or another material of interest is much smaller than in ordinary rotary drilling, ordinary hammering, or ordinary steady pushing. The predecessor of the <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> auto-gopher is an apparatus, now denoted an ultrasonic/sonic gopher and previously denoted an ultrasonic gopher, described in "Ultrasonic/ Sonic Mechanism for Drilling and Coring" (NPO- 30291), NASA Tech Briefs Vol. 27, No. 9 (September 2003), page 65. The ultrasonic/sonic gopher is intended for use mainly in acquiring cores. The name of the apparatus reflects the fact that, like a gopher, it periodically stops advancing at the end of the hole to bring excavated material (in this case, a core sample) to the surface, then re-enters the hole to resume the advance of the end of the hole. By use of a cable suspended from a reel on the surface, the gopher is lifted from the hole to remove a core sample, then lowered into the hole to resume the advance and acquire the next core sample...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{evaluating}} {{the probability of a}} Viable Earth Microorganism (VEM) contaminating a sample during the sample acquisition and handling (SAH) process of a potential future Mars Sample Return mission is developed. A scenario where multiple core samples would be acquired using a <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> coring tool, deployed from an arm on a MER class rover is analyzed. The analysis is conducted in a structured way by decomposing sample acquisition and handling process into a series of discrete time steps, and breaking the physical system into a set of relevant components. At each discrete time step, two key functions are defined: The probability of a VEM being released from each component, and the transport matrix, which represents the probability of VEM transport from one component to another. By defining the expected the number of VEMs on each component {{at the start of the}} sampling process, these decompositions allow the expected number of VEMs on each component at each sampling step to be represented as a Markov chain. This formalism provides a rigorous mathematical framework in which to analyze the probability of a VEM entering the sample chain, as well as making the analysis tractable by breaking the process down into small analyzable steps...|$|R

The equipment used for this step {{is dependent on the}} stability of the material in which the soil nail wall is supporting. <b>Rotary</b> or <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> methods using air flush or dry auger methods can be used with stable ground.

The <b>percussive</b> <b>hammer</b> blow sounds of the pile driver were measured on 2 days at distances of 250, 500, and 1000 m; broadband pulse levels were reduced by 3 – 5 dB by the bubble curtain.

Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphins (Sousa chinensis) occurred in the immediate area of the industrial activity before and during pile driving, but with a lower abundance immediately after it. While hump-backed dolphins generally showed no overt behavioral changes with and without pile driving, their speeds of travel increased during pile driving, indicating that bubble screening did not eliminate all behavioral responses to the loud noise.

40|$|The {{search for}} {{evidence}} of life on Mars is the ultimate motivation for its scientific exploration. The results from the Phoenix mission indicate that the high N. latitude ice-rich regolith at low elevations {{is likely to be}} a recently habitable place on Mars [Stoker et al., 2010]. The near-surface ice likely provided adequate water activity during periods of high obliquity, 3 to 10 Myr ago. Carbon dioxide and nitrogen are present in the atmosphere, and nitrates may be present in the soil. Together with iron in basaltic rocks and perchlorate in the soil they provide carbon and energy sources, and oxidative power to drive metabolism. Furthermore, the presence of organics is possible, as thermally reactive perchlorate would have prevented their detection by Viking and Phoenix. The Mars Icebreaker Life mission [McKay et al., 2013] focuses on the following science goals: (1) Search for biomolecular evidence of life; (2) Search for organic matter from either exogeneous or endogeneous sources using methods that are not effected by the presence of perchlorate; (3) Characterize oxidative species that produced reactivity of soils seen by Viking; and 4) Assess the habitability of the ice bearing soils.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to develop}} a {{comprehensive}} strategy for automatic control of the ITH percussive drilling process. Such automation would provide the benefits of improved productivity and quality in terms of penetration rate and hole deviation, as well as enhanced hole quality and machine life. Analysis of field data acquired from drilling experiments performed at INCO's Little Stobie Mine is presented. As {{a result of this}} analysis, a control algorithm is formulated to enhance the drilling process efficiency. This algorithm calculates the specific energy (SE) of the rock and adjusts the applied feed force based on this SE value, using a relationship obtained from the field data analysis. A model of the percussive drilling process is developed and simulated in software. The proposed control algorithm is tested through simulations on this simulated drilling process. The results of the simulation show a significant increase in efficiency of the drilling process. As a result of vibration data analysis it is concluded that vibration should be controlled through an improved design of the shock-absorber, rather than through drilling variables. A detailed shock-absorber test data analysis is therefore presented. Recommendations for design changes in the shock-absorber are also given. Deviation analysis is also presented in the thesis, which shows a poor correlation between the machine variables and the hole deviation data. Hence, it is recommended that deviation be controlled by steering. An innovative guided drilling mechanism for controlling the hole deviation is also proposed. This mechanism consists of an eccentric ITH <b>percussive</b> <b>hammer</b> with controlled rotational speed, which can be employed as an actuator to steer the drill string in a desired direction without using any down hole instrumentation.

40|$|Objective: To {{develop a}} {{practical}} method of measuring shotcrete adhesion strength in underground mines. A more {{thorough understanding of}} the in-situ strength properties of shotcrete, particularly the bond strength of shotcrete to the rock, will lead to improvements in ground support practices, thereby preventing ground falls and reducing mine roof-fall incidents. Background: When shotcrete is used {{as an integral part}} of a mine's ground support system, it is important to know the strength properties of the in-place shotcrete. To quantify the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock, a shotcrete adhesion test system has been developed for use in underground mines. The test system consists of readily available components, primarily a small stand-mounted core drill and a pulling unit equipped with a precision pressure gauge. All of these components are rugged and portable, and they can reliably be used to measure the adhesion strength of shotcrete app lied to the surface of an underground mine opening. With this test method, a direct tensile load is applied to a core drilled through the shotcrete into the underlying rock. As this load is gradually increased, the test core typically breaks or fails in tension. This tensile failure can occur in the shotcrete, at the bond surface (interface), in the rock, or at some combination of these locations. As a result, the tensile-strength values derived from these tests provide important information about the quality of the applied shotcrete and the competency of the underlying rock, as well as the bond strength of the shotcrete to the rock. Conducting the Shotcrete Adhesion Test: Once a desired test site has been selected, a hand-operated <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> drill is used to drill a 16 -mm x 51 -mm (0. 625 - in x 2 -in) hole for anchoring the drill stand. After installing a 13 -mm- (0. 5 -in-) diameter threaded stud and expansion anchor in this hole, the drill stand is leveled and secured in position. Three holes are then drilled from this drill setup ensuring that all of the holes are parallel and concentric. First, an 11. 1 -mm- (0. 4375 -in-) diameter hole is drilled dry into the shotcrete using a <b>rotary</b> <b>percussive</b> bit, to a depth of 60 mm (2. 375 in), assuming a shotcrete thickness of 75 mm (3 in). Next, the hole is cleaned, filled with a quick-setting, two-part epoxy adhesive, and a 9. 5 -mm- (0. 375 -in-) diameter pull anchor is inserted. After the epoxy has initially set or gelled (about 15 min), a 102 -mm- (4 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a second hole through the shotcrete to a depth of about 25 to 50 mm (1 to 2 in) into the underlying rock. Finally, a 127 -mm- (5 -in-) diameter diamond core bit is used to wet drill a shallow kerf for seating the base of the pulling fixture. After the epoxy has fully set (30 - 60 min), a threaded extension rod is connected to the pull anchor with a coupling nut; the pulling fixture is then carefully placed over the core sample with the base of its reaction ring positioned in the kerf of the outer drill hole. Next, a collet and a slip-on, quick-threading locknut are connected to the threaded extension rod to serve as a mechanical stop for the pulling fixture's ram. The hydraulic hose from the hand pump is then connected to the loading ram, and the pressure gauge is zeroed. To conduct a test, an increasing tensile load is applied to the core sample through a slow and steady movement of the pump handle until the core breaks.

40|$|Acquiring {{samples from}} the {{subsurface}} of Mars poses many challenges. The scientific return increases with the depth from which the samples are obtained, but so does the risk. Thus, {{it is important to}} develop a fully autonomous drilling platform that will be capable of accessing the required depth and retrieving cores for scientific analysis. The method of drilling most likely to succeed will be a conventional mechanical core drill, either <b>rotary</b> or <b>percussive,</b> with a mechanical system for removing the cuttings and rock core from the hole. Instead of fluid flushing systems for removing cuttings, which {{would be very difficult to}} provide and in addition may contaminate the sample, an auger system is the best solution for rotary drilling. However, no such solution has been identified for the percussive drilling method. To solve this problem, a novel means of conveying cuttings out of the hole during percussive drilling has been developed and is presented in this paper. It relies on the reciprocating action between a pair of surfaces covered with bristles. Experimental results show that there is an optimum ratio of particle diameter to bristle length that gives the highest speed of particle conveyance. This new method also stabilizes the hole so that the drill string may be removed to recover a rock core sample. ...|$|R

Complexities involved in the drilling process encompassing not only rock properties but also {{the nature of the}} drilling action impact the drilling performance and operational costs. Brittleness is a fundamental rock property relevant to rock drilling and excavation works. However, rock brittleness is a concept yet to be investigated. In this study, a new brittleness index developed upon fracture energy quantities withdrawn from the complete stressstrain characteristics in uniaxial compression of rock is presented. A vast independent data on the drilling performance reported elsewhere in the literature was evaluated against the new brittleness index. The results show that the proposed brittleness index successfully describes the performance of different drilling methods including PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) rotary drilling, roller-cone <b>rotary</b> drilling and <b>percussive</b> drilling.

40|$|Geothermal {{heat flow}} is {{obtained}} {{as a product}} of the geothermal gradient and the thermal conductivity of the vertical soil/rock/regolith interval penetrated by the instrument. Heat flow measurements are a high priority for the geophysical network missions to the Moon recommended by the latest Decadal Survey and previously the International Lunar Network. One of the difficulties associated with lunar heat flow measurement on a robotic mission is that it requires excavation of a relatively deep (approx 3 m) hole {{in order to avoid the}} long-term temporal changes in lunar surface thermal environment affecting the subsurface temperature measurements. Such changes may be due to the 18. 6 -year-cylcle lunar precession, or may be initiated by presence of the lander itself. Therefore, a key science requirement for heat flow instruments for future lunar missions is to penetrate 3 m into the regolith and to measure both thermal gradient and thermal conductivity. Engineering requirements are that the instrument itself has minimal impact on the subsurface thermal regime and that it must be a low-mass and low-power system like any other science instrumentation on planetary landers. It would be very difficult to meet the engineering requirements, if the instrument utilizes a long (> 3 m) probe driven into the ground by a <b>rotary</b> or <b>percussive</b> drill.

40|$|First online: 13 January 2016 Rock {{drilling}} Penetration Rate (PR) {{is influenced}} by many parameters including rock properties, machine parameters of the chosen rig and the working process. Five datasets were utilized to quantitatively assess the effect of various rock properties on PR. The datasets consisted of two sets of diamond and percussive drilling and one set of rotary drilling data. A new rating system called Rock Drillability Characterization index (RDCi) is proposed to predict PR for different drilling methods. This drillability model incorporates {{the uniaxial compressive strength}} of intact rock, the P-wave velocity and the density of rock. The RDCi system is further applied to predict PR in the diamond rotary drilling, non-coring <b>rotary</b> drilling and <b>percussive</b> drilling. Strong correlations between PR and RDCi values were observed indicating that the developed drillability rating model is relevant and can be utilized to effectively predict the rock drillability in any operating environment. A practical procedure for predicting PR using the RDCi was established. The drilling engineers can follow this procedure to use RDCi as an effective method to estimate drillability.

40|$|Modelling the {{behaviour}} of extinct hominins {{is essential}} in order to devise useful hypotheses of our species' evolutionary origins for testing in the palaeontological and archaeological records. One approach is to model the last common ancestor (LCA) of living apes and humans, based on current ethological and ecological knowledge of our closest living relations. Such referential modelling is based on rigorous, ongoing field studies of the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and the bonobo (Pan paniscus). This paper reviews recent findings from nature, focusing on those with direct implications for hominin evolution, e. g. apes, using elementary technology to access basic resources such as food and water, or sheltering in caves or bathing as thermoregulatory adaptations. I give preference to studies that directly address key issues, such as whether stone artefacts are detectible before the Oldowan, based on the <b>percussive</b> technology of <b>hammer</b> and anvil use by living apes. Detailed comparative studies of chimpanzees living in varied habitats, from rainforest to savannah, reveal that some behavioural patterns are universal (e. g. shelter construction), while others show marked (e. g. extractive foraging) or nuanced (e. g. courtship) cross-populational variation. These findings allow us to distinguish between retained, primitive traits of the LCA versus derived ones in the human lineage...|$|R
40|$|Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} (HTV) {{arising from}} hand power tools {{has long been}} associated with several disorders of the hand and arm, which are collectively termed as hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). Owing to high prevalence of HAVS among the operators of the power tools, particularly the percussive tools, the desire to develop low vibration tool designs, has been widely recognized. The design of vibration isolators or assessment of vibration performance of tools necessitates development of dynamic model of the tool coupled {{with that of the}} hand-arm system (HAS) to account for energy absorption within the HAS. This dissertation research is aimed at development of dynamic model of a <b>percussive</b> chipping <b>hammer</b> together with a biomechanical model of the hand-arm system. The model could serve as an essential tool for identifying effective vibration attenuation design features. The dynamic model of the tool is formulated considering identifications of various component contact pairs and the air flows between the primary piston and the striker. A tool tip-workpiece contact model is integrated to the tool model to describe the interactions between the tool and an energy dissipator. A biomechanical model of the hand-arm system is implemented to the tool model to develop a coupled hand-tool system, which could be applied to determine the hand vibration responses {{as a function of the}} push force. The properties of different impact pairs are identified from the theory of visco-elastic collision between rigid bodies. The validity of the hand-tool model is examined on the basis of available measured data under selected levels of the hand push force. A simple model of an anti-vibration glove is further introduced to study its effectiveness in limiting the vibration exposure. The simulation results show that the percussive tool model coupled with the biomechanical hand-arm model can yield reasonably good trends in view of the hand-transmitted vibration. The results suggest that the tool vibration transmitted to the hand is more sensitive to variations in push force and the operating speed. Slight increases in the diameter of the upper chamber orifices and the weight of the tool body, together with lower the striker mass, could yield notable reductions in the magnitudes of vibration transmitted to the hand-arm system. The results further show that the anti-vibration gloves yield very minimal vibration attenuation. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011, we used three {{geotechnical}} instruments to assess the ground conditions in planetary analog sites on the Devon Island, Canadian High Arctic. The instruments included Percussive Cone Penetrometer (PCP) developed by Honeybee Robotics, and the two off the shelf instruments: Dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP), and the Static Cone Penetrometer (SCP). The three systems differed by the methods the rod was driven into the soil. SCP used a reaction force provided by the operator to drive the rod into the ground, the DCP used a drop hammer, and PCP used a high frequency <b>hammer</b> (<b>percussive)</b> system. The three instruments were evaluated based {{on their ability to}} be used by astronauts and be deployed autonomously on planetary robotic platforms (e. g. rovers, hoppers). The SCP, although simple to operate, was limited to soft soils and its data was unreliable. DCP required two people to operate, was heavy, and though the data was reliable, it took a few minutes to obtain it. The PCP has proven to be very reliable, fast, and the data was obtained and plotted in real time. Hence, PCP is recommended as the optimum geotechnical tool for planetary exploration for either a robotic system or an astronaut. The tests were performed at the Drill Hill site within the Haughton Crater. The site was covered by the polygonal features, the telltale signs of water activity (freeze-thaw cycle) beneath the surface. The measurements were taken at the polygons junctions, sides, and the center. It was found the polygon junctions are the weakest, followed by polygon sides, and finally polygon centers (the strongest).

40|$|This Master Thesis {{was done}} at Atlas Copco Rock Drills AB in Örebro. It treats how the {{geometry}} of impact pistons in hydraulic <b>percussive</b> rock drill <b>hammers</b> can be improved. The material in these pistons is highly loaded during each impact and there are cases where fatigue failure has occurred. One critical location for fatigue damage is the fillet between the boom and {{the tail of the}} piston. This is because the stress pulse from the impact is amplified in this area. By developing a full transient analysis for a piston in ANSYS, and by using design optimization, a new type of fillet was constructed from a cubic b-spline. This new fillet has the same length as the old fillet, a double radius fillet, on the piston tail, but it has 12 ‒ 16 % lower maximum stress range, depending on the stress measure. A special feature with this fillet is that it is cut into the material of the boom. In that way it could be longer than the double radius fillet which enables a larger radius of curvature and a longer distance to “lead” in the stress pulse into the tail. This results in lower stress ranges in the fillet. Several multiaxial stress fatigue methods were used to analyze the fatigue damage in the old double radius fillet and in the new undercut fillet. It was found that the double radius fillet has a safety factor of 0. 98 ‒ 1. 08 to infinite fatigue life and the undercut fillet has a safety factor of 1. 10 ‒ 1. 23 to infinite fatigue life, depending on the fatigue method. Because infinite fatigue life normally corresponds to 106 ‒ 107 equivalent stress cycles, and the piston is desired to withstand close to one billon impacts, the old double radius fillet does not leave any margins to effects which can occur in the giga-cycle regime. The undercut fillet on the other hand leaves some margins to these kinds of effects. Unfortunately, no fatigue parameters were known for the material in the considered piston, so they were estimated from empirical relations. During the work with the undercut fillet it was realized that the weight of the impact piston can be reduced by minimizing the weight of the piston tail without affecting its performance. By using design optimization with the constraint that the maximum stress range in the piston tail should not be larger than the maximum stress range in the double radius fillet, its weight was reduced by 38 %. With this change in mass, less energy is needed to accelerate the piston and less reflection energy is needed to be damped out. Validerat; 20130917 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
40|$|Rock {{drilling}} and cutting {{is essential in}} the mining industry. Rock characterisation and classification methods have been proposed to assess drilling or cutting performance. However, a unique method to relate rock characteristics to rock cutting performance {{has not yet been}} developed. This is due to the complexity of interactions among the variables involved in the drilling process encompassing not only rock properties, but also the nature of drilling. Cost-effective drilling is achievable by allocating the available gross energy towards the drilling action and, at the same time, reducing systematically that energy consumed in frictional processes inherent to tool-rock interactions. Several {{attempts have been made to}} assess drilling performance by correlating different rock properties with the drilling rate. For instance, rock texture, grain size, Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS), Mohs hardness and rock mass structural parameters, and others have been used to build a number of drillability indices. However, not only rock properties, but also different sets of drilling parameters and drilling techniques have an impact on the drilling performance and efficiency of the process. On one hand, to predict rock drilling performance and optimisation of drilling operation, tool-rock interaction laws, i. e. the relations between forces acting on the tool in contact with rock, are essential. For instance, through tool-rock interaction laws, it was found that during rotary drilling, the energy consumed in pure cutting action of rock is measured by the intrinsic specific energy. In the case of percussive drilling, tool-rock interactions are focused mostly in the prediction of the penetration rate and the optimum thrust. On the other hand, rock failure characterised by rock brittleness is a concept yet to be investigated as there is not a unique criterion able to describe rock brittleness quantitatively nor consensus about the most suitable and reliable brittleness index to apply to different rock engineering works encountered in the field. A new brittleness index upon fracture strain-energy quantities extracted from the area under complete stress-strain curve of rocks in uniaxial compressive tests is proposed herein to study drilling performance by rock brittleness capacity. This brittleness index takes into account post-peak instability in uniaxial compression as post-peak instability of rock during compression can be treated as a manifestation of rock brittleness. That is, an increase in the post-peak energy indicates an increase of stability (i. e. a decrease in brittleness or increase in ductility). In the same manner, a dramatic decrease of post-peak energy indicates less stability of the failure process (i. e. an increase in brittleness). In this view, advanced laboratory experiments on strength and deformability of soft-to-hard rock types (UCS is ranging from 7 to 215 MPa) were carried out. The compressive tests complied with the application of a prescribed constant lateral strain-rate as a feedback signal to control the axial load which was found to be a suitable loading rate to measure the complete stress-strain response for the rocks. The new brittleness index developed herein describes a monotonic and unambiguous scale of brittleness with increasing pre-peak strength parameters such as crack damage stress and peak stress as well as deformation parameters such as the tangent Young’s modulus of rock. This outcome becomes relevant in order to better understand material brittleness associated with the progressive fracture process characterised by the typical threshold damage stresses, peak stress and the elasticity parameters. The brittleness index scale indicates that a higher brittleness index means that rock is more brittle which corresponds to higher strength rocks. In order to reliably estimate drilling performance both tool-rock interaction laws along with a proper rock brittleness index are required to be implemented. In this study the performance of a single PDC (Polycrystalline Diamond Compact) cutter cutting and different drilling methods including PDC rotary drilling, roller-cone <b>rotary</b> {{drilling and}} <b>percussive</b> drilling were investigated. To investigate drilling performance by rock strength properties, laboratory PDC cutting tests were performed on soft-to-hard rocks to obtain cutting parameters. In addition, results of laboratory and field drilling on different rocks found elsewhere in literature were used. Laboratory and field cutting and drilling test results were coupled with values of a new rock brittleness index proposed herein and developed upon energy dissipation extracted from the complete stress-strain curve in uniaxial compression. To quantify cutting and drilling performance, the intrinsic specific energy in rotary-cutting action, i. e. the energy consumed in pure cutting action, and drilling penetration rate values in percussive action were used. The results show that the new energy-based brittleness index successfully describes the performance of the studied cutting and drilling methods. Thesis (Ph. D.)
