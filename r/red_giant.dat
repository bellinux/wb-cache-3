5|$|Around 5.4billion {{years from}} now, {{the core of}} the Sun will become hot enough to trigger {{hydrogen}} fusion in its surrounding shell. This will cause the outer layers of the star to expand greatly, and the star will enter a phase of its life in which it is called a <b>red</b> <b>giant.</b> Within 7.5billion years, the Sun will have expanded to a radius of 1.2AU—256 times its current size. At the tip of the <b>red</b> <b>giant</b> branch, {{as a result of the}} vastly increased surface area, the Sun's surface will be much cooler (about 2600K) than now and its luminosity much higher—up to 2,700current solar luminosities. For part of its <b>red</b> <b>giant</b> life, the Sun will have a strong stellar wind that will carry away around 33% of its mass. During these times, it is possible that Saturn's moon Titan could achieve surface temperatures necessary to support life.|$|E

5|$|Located {{close to}} Polaris is Lambda Ursae Minoris, a <b>red</b> <b>giant</b> of {{spectral}} type M1III. It is a semiregular variable varying from magnitudes 6.35 to 6.45. The northerly {{nature of the}} constellation means that the variable stars can be observed all year: the <b>red</b> <b>giant</b> R Ursae Minoris is a semiregular variable varying from magnitude 8.5 to 11.5 over 328days, while S Ursae Minoris is a long period variable that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 11 over 331days. Located south of Kochab and Pherkad towards Draco is RR Ursae Minoris, a <b>red</b> <b>giant</b> of spectral type M5III that is also a semiregular variable ranging from magnitude 4.44 to 4.85 {{over a period of}} 43.3days. T Ursae Minoris is another <b>red</b> <b>giant</b> variable star that has undergone a dramatic change in status—from being a long period (Mira) variable ranging from magnitude 7.8 to 15 over 310–315 days to a semiregular variable. The star is thought to have undergone a shell helium flash—a point where the shell of helium around the star's core reaches a critical mass and ignites—marked by its abrupt change in variability in 1979. Z Ursae Minoris is a faint variable star that suddenly dropped 6magnitudes in 1992 and was identified as one of a rare class of stars—R Coronae Borealis variables.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} in the future, IK Pegasi A will consume the {{hydrogen}} fuel at its core and start to evolve away from the main sequence to form a <b>red</b> <b>giant.</b> The envelope of a <b>red</b> <b>giant</b> can grow to significant dimensions, extending up to a hundred times its previous radius (or larger). Once IK Pegasi A expands to the point where its outer envelope overflows the Roche lobe of its companion, a gaseous accretion disk will form around the white dwarf. This gas, composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, will then accrete onto the surface of the companion. This mass transfer between the stars will also cause their mutual orbit to shrink.|$|E

5|$|Marking {{the heart}} of the serpent is the constellation's {{brightest}} star, Alpha Serpentis. Traditionally called Unukalhai, is a <b>red</b> <b>giant</b> of spectral type K2III located approximately 23 parsecs distant with a visual magnitude of 2.630 ± 0.009, meaning it can easily be seen with the naked eye even in areas with substantial light pollution. A faint companion is in orbit around the <b>red</b> <b>giant</b> star, although it is not visible to the naked eye. Situated near Alpha is Lambda Serpentis, a magnitude 4.42 ± 0.05 star rather similar to the Sun positioned only 12 parsecs away.

40|$|The Kepler {{mission has}} been a success in both {{exoplanet}} search and stellar physics studies. Red giants have actually been quite a highlight in the Kepler scene. The Kepler long and almost continuous four-year observations allowed us to detect oscillations in more than 15, 000 <b>red</b> <b>giants</b> targeted by the mission. However {{by looking at the}} power spectra of 45, 000 stars classified as dwarfs according to the Q 1 - 16 Kepler star properties catalog, we detected red-giant like oscillations in 850 stars. Even though this is a small addition to the known red-giant sample, these misclassified stars represent a goldmine for galactic archeology studies. Indeed they happen to be fainter (down to Kp~ 16) and more distant (d> 10 kpc) than the known <b>red</b> <b>giants,</b> opening the possibility to probe unknown regions of our Galaxy.

Ten of them were detected in a survey by Castilho et al. (1998), and the other 6 stars are Li-rich giants selected from the literature. Element abundances in the sample Li-rich giants are similar to those in normal <b>red</b> <b>giants,</b> differing only by their high Li abundance and infrared excess. This suggests that Li-rich giants may correspond to a phase of stellar evolution of normal <b>red</b> <b>giants,</b> when Li is produced and transported to the atmosphere...|$|R

5|$|After {{the star}} has fused the helium of its core, the carbon product fuses {{producing}} a hot core with an outer shell of fusing helium. The star then follows an evolutionary path called the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) that parallels the other described <b>red</b> <b>giant</b> phase, {{but with a}} higher luminosity. The more massive AGB stars may undergo {{a brief period of}} carbon fusion before the core becomes degenerate.|$|E
5|$|In about 65 billion years, it {{estimated}} that the Moon may end up colliding with the Earth, assuming they are not destroyed by the <b>red</b> <b>giant</b> Sun, due to the remaining energy of the Earth–Moon system being sapped by the remnant Sun, causing the Moon to slowly move inwards toward the Earth.|$|E
5|$|Left {{to run its}} course, this tidal drag would {{continue}} until the spin of Earth and the orbital period of the Moon matched, creating mutual tidal locking between the two.

5|$|Sakurai's Object (V4334 Sgr) {{is a star}} in the {{constellation}} of Sagittarius.

5|$|The {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a closed binary star system. The larger of the two stars is the first to evolve off the main sequence, and it expands to form a <b>red</b> <b>giant.</b> The two stars now share a common envelope, causing their mutual orbit to shrink. The giant star then sheds most of its envelope, losing mass until it can no longer continue nuclear fusion. At this point it becomes a white dwarf star, composed primarily of carbon and oxygen. Eventually the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence to form a <b>red</b> <b>giant.</b> Matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf, causing the latter to increase in mass. Despite widespread acceptance of the basic model, the exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the catastrophic event are still unclear.|$|E
40|$|Context. The {{structures}} of the outer atmospheres of <b>red</b> <b>giants</b> are very complex. Recent interpretations {{of a range of}} different observations have led to contradictory views of these regions. It is, however, clear that classical model photospheres are inadequate to describe the nature of the outer atmospheres. The notion of large optically thick molecular spheres around the stars (MOLspheres) has been invoked in order to explain spectro-interferometric observations, as well as low- and high-resolution spectra. On the other hand high-resolution spectra in the mid-IR do not easily fit into this picture. On the contrary, they rule out any large sphere of water vapour in LTE surrounding <b>red</b> <b>giants.</b> Aims. In order to approach a unified scenario for these outer regions of <b>red</b> <b>giants,</b> more empirical evidence from different diagnostics are needed. Our aim here is to investigate high-resolution, mid-infrared spectra for a range of <b>red</b> <b>giants,</b> spanning spectral types from early-K to mid M. We want to study how the pure rotational lines of water vapour change with effective temperature, and whether we can find common properties that can put new constraints on the modelling of these regions, so that we thereby can gain new insights.
