Dr. Mario, Roy, Young Link, Mewtwo, and Pichu are the first characters to not <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> previous game, though they do appear as stickers or trophies.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{screening}} of the short for MGM executives, opinion was divided on whether Garland or Durbin should be retained. Finally, Louis B. Mayer, upon his <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> European trip, decreed that both girls should be kept. However, Durbin's contract option had expired by then. She was signed by Universal Studios, where her first picture, Three Smart Girls, was so successful that it saved Universal from bankruptcy.|$|E

Lad charges between them and battles the sow, but with his old age and blunt fangs he struggles with the fight and is badly injured. Bruce and Wolf <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> forest romp in time to aid him, and the younger dogs are able to easily drive her off.

Lad's feelings are hurt by the battle being finished by the other dogs and the Mistress' holding him back from joining them at the end, but he quickly forgives her.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{participated in}} the Rangers' {{training}} camp that preceded the 2013–14 season, during which he impressed New York's head coach Alain Vigneault, and head European scout Anders Hedberg. Although {{it was his first}} North American professional training camp, Fast made the Rangers roster, partially because the team needed a right-handed shot to replace the injured captain Ryan Callahan. Fast made his NHL debut on October 3 against the Phoenix Coyotes, taking one shot on goal in 10:13 of ice time. Fast played in eight of the Rangers' first 10 games of the season, playing on the fourth line and recording no points and a -5 plus-minus, before returning to the AHL to make room for Carl Hagelin's <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> shoulder injury. Observers said Fast needed to adjust to the smaller North American ice surface, and did not get sufficient minutes to do so quickly enough to remain in the NHL.|$|E

5|$|Iris Crowe is {{the older}} sister of Brother Justin and a devoted {{supporter}} of his ministry duties in California. Iris' {{significance in the}} series starts when Brother Justin informs her about the church board's plan to take away his new ministry. Shortly after, {{a fire in the}} church kills several orphans, but it remains unknown {{until the end of the}} first season that Iris was the arsonist. Radio show host Tommy Dolan, who arrived to help with the arson investigation, develops feelings for Iris, but a romance is hindered by Brother Justin's <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> week-long self-discovery trip. Dolan starts to uncover evidence pointing to Iris's guilt, but a strange twist at Iris's planned public confession results in Dolan's arrest as the culprit. To prevent the revelation of Brother Justin's true nature, Iris murders an innocent Okie, Eleanor. Late in the second season, Iris joins her foster father Norman in an ultimately unsuccessful plot against Brother Justin.|$|E

5|$|With {{the piece}} {{set to open}} on 26 December, Gilbert first read the {{libretto}} to the cast on 14 December, but Toole, who was playing {{the central role of}} Thespis, did not <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> tour of the British provinces until 18 December. He then appeared in nine performances at the Gaiety in the six days immediately after his return, and other actors had similar commitments. In addition, Hollingshead had committed the company to perform a pantomime at The Crystal Palace on 21 December, which included many of the performers who would be in Thespis. Lastly, Thespis was to play as the afterpiece to an H. J.

5|$|During late October and November 1943, the {{battalion}} {{was engaged in}} anti-partisan operations around Žaga (Saga) and Kobarid (Karfreit), including Operation Traufe (Eaves). In late November, it was placed {{under the command of}} the Supreme SS and Police Leader, Italy, SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS (Lieutenant General) Karl Wolff for an operation. In February 1944, {{the battalion}} conducted Operation Ratte (Rat), during which it burned down the villages of Komen and Branik (Rihenberg), and interned the population of both villages in labour camps. Early in 1944, Brandt suggested that Slovene nationalists be recruited into the battalion, but the idea was rejected by SS headquarters who feared that such a policy would allow the infiltration of the unit by Yugoslav Partisans. At this stage, it was estimated that there were about 20,000 communist partisans operating in the Gorizia region. During March 1944, the battalion was involved in a rapid series of operations, including Zypresse (Cypress), Märzveilchen (Violet), Maulwurf (Mole) and Hellblau (Light Blue), resulting in significant guerrilla casualties, as well as executions of captured partisans. In March and April, Operation Osterglocke (Daffodil) was conducted over 12 days, followed by Operation Liane in late May, and the long-running Operation Annemarie which covered the period 7 May to 16 July 1944. In June 1944, a patrol from the battalion failed to <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> task in the vicinity of Cividale del Friuli. Two days later, they were found naked with their severed heads impaled on bayonets. The unit became known for shooting suspected partisans. While engaged in anti-partisan work, the battalion grew to a strength of around 1,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{last half}} of the century's first decade was a time of sorrow, {{loneliness}} and constant work for Pankhurst. In 1907 she sold her home in Manchester and began an itinerant lifestyle, moving from place to place as she spoke and marched for women's suffrage. She stayed with friends and in hotels, carrying her few possessions in suitcases. Although she was energised by the struggle–and found joy in giving energy to others– her constant travelling meant separation from her children, especially Christabel, who had become the national coordinator of the WSPU. In 1909, as Pankhurst planned a speaking tour of the United States, Harry was paralysed after his spinal cord became inflamed. She hesitated to leave the country while he was ill, but she needed money to pay for his treatment and the tour promised to be lucrative. On her <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> successful tour, she sat by Harry's bedside as he died on 5 January 1910. Five days later she buried her son, then spoke before 5,000 people in Manchester. Liberal Party supporters who had come to heckle her remained quiet as she addressed the crowd.|$|E

5|$|The second divisional game of {{the year}} for the 3–0 Bears, looking for their first 4–0 start in seven seasons, took place at Ford Field against the 2–1 Detroit Lions. Since 2001, the Bears had won 17 of the {{meetings}} between the two, compared to Detroit's 9. The Bears defense, ranked 19th in scoring defense with 24.7 points per game and 25th in yards allowed with 383.0, had {{to keep up with the}} Lions' 4th-ranked offense, who recorded 410.7 yards per game 27.3 PPG, sixth in the league. The Lions also had running back Reggie Bush <b>return</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> knee injury; Bush had recorded 260 yards and a touchdown in the first two games. However, the Lions' leading receiver Nate Burleson broke his arm in a car accident, which meant additional focus on Calvin Johnson for the Bears. Expectations were for Charles Tillman to cover Johnson, who was limited by Tillman to 15 catches, no touchdowns and an average of 62.3 receiving yards in the last three games. Although Tillman had suffered groin and knee injuries that left him questionable for the game, he was later listed as active against the Lions. However, Johnson recorded 40 catches for 20+ yards in 2012, and the Bears allowed the Steelers to gain 20 yards or more in nine plays. To attempt to combat Johnson, the Bears switched from the pressure defense run in the first three games to the cover 2. In the battle on the line of scrimmage, the Bears had to contain Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley, while the Lions had to protect Matthew Stafford from Julius Peppers and Corey Wootton. Offensively, the Bears also had to survive the crowd, who helped the Bears commit nine false start penalties in 2011.|$|E
