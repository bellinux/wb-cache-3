He studied {{painting}} and film while at the University of Minnesota, before moving to Hollywood in 1955, to become an apprentice film editor. He moved into work as a sound engineer in 1958, and apprenticed at Gotham Recording Studios, where he first started composing. Around this same time he also worked for Terrytoons alongside Gene Deitch. From 1961 to 1962, when Deitch directed thirteen new Tom and Jerry shorts, Dockstader was responsible for creating the unusual, heavily <b>reverberated</b> <b>sound</b> effects heard throughout them; he also wrote the shorts Mouse into Space and Landing Stripling.|$|E
5000|$|A {{good example}} of {{time-controlled}} noise gating is the well-known [...] "gated reverb" [...] effect heard on the drums on the Phil Collins hit single [...] "In the Air Tonight", created by engineer-producer Hugh Padgham, in which the powerful reverberation added to the drums is cut off by the noise gate after a few milliseconds, rather than being allowed to decay naturally. This can also be achieved by: sending the 'dry' snare signal to the reverb (or other process) unit, inserting a noise gate {{on the path of}} the reverb signal and connecting the snare sound to the side chain of the gate unit. With the gate unit set to 'external sidechain' (or 'external key'), the gate will respond to the snare signal level and 'cut off' when that has decayed below the threshold, not the <b>reverberated</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Adding {{absorptive}} {{materials to}} the interior surfaces of rooms (e.g. fabric-faced fiberglass panels, thick curtains) {{will result in a}} decrease of <b>reverberated</b> <b>sound</b> energy within the room. However, absorptive interior surface treatments do not significantly improve the sound isolation from one room to another through demising partitions over the typical frequency range measured currently. Installing absorptive insulation (e.g., fiberglass batts, blow-in cellulose, mineral fiber batts) into the wall or ceiling cavities affects the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees, depending on the framing configuration and joist or stud depth. For example, the presence of type of insulation in single 2x4 wood stud framing spaced 16" [...] (406 mm) on-center results in only a few STC points. In contrast, adding standard fiberglass insulation to an otherwise empty cavity in light-gauge (25-gauge or lighter) steel stud partitions can result in a nearly 10 STC-point improvement. As the stud gauge becomes heavier, the presence and type of insulation matters less.|$|E

We show that the spatial aliasing introduced by spectral sampling represents all the (damped) reflections. From the samples of the generalized spectrum, we compute the spatio-temporal sound field in the enclosed space with very low-complexity, ofO(N logN) per measuring position, with N proportional to the reverberation time.

40|$|At high frequencies, {{the sound}} {{propagation}} can {{be approximated by}} the propagation of sound particles which are reflected and absorbed at the boundaries. This propagation follows then a transport process. In urban canyons, this transport process {{can be reduced to}} a diffusion process. The resultant model allows one to obtain the spatial distribution of the acoustical energy in a street in a few seconds using a classical finite elements program. This diffusion model has been previously validated in rectilinear streets for different geometrical and acoustical parameters. In this paper, more complex geometries such as varying cross-sections, bents and streets crossings are dealt with.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{approach is}} proposed {{to model the}} <b>reverberated</b> <b>sound</b> field in rooms. The model {{is based on the}} numerical implementation of a diffusion model enabling spatial variations of the sound energy within a room, unlike the statistical theory. The proposed method allows to take into account most of complex phenomena encountered in room acoustics, like mixed reflections on walls (diffuse and specular), low and high absorption on walls, atmospheric attenuation, fitted zones. Moreover, the model can be applied to complex geometries, like multiple coupled rooms of different sizes. In this paper, the model and its numerical implementation are first detailed. Then, an application is proposed for a complex geometry defined by multiple coupled rooms with fitting objects, including low and high absorption on walls, in terms of sound level and reverberation times. The main interest of the model is that such approach requires less computational time in comparison with common approaches like ray-tracing simulations...|$|E
40|$|Adaptive {{filtering}} {{technique is}} one of the core technologies in digital signal processing and finds numerous application areas in science as well as in industry. Adaptive filtering technique is widely used in many applications, including echo cancellation, adaptive noise cancellation, adaptive beam forming and adaptive equalization. Acoustic echo is a common occurrence in today’s telecommunication systems. The distraction caused by the acoustic echo, reduces the speech quality in the communication. In the communication system acoustic echo cancellers is used works as the far-end signal is delivered to the system, it will be reproduced by the loudspeaker in the room. A microphone in the room picks up the resulting direct path sound and consequent reverberant sound as a near-end signal, The far-end signal is filtered and delayed to resemble the near-end signal, filtered far-end signal is subtracted from the near-end signal. The resultant signal represents sounds present in the room excluding any direct or <b>reverberated</b> <b>sound</b> produced by the loudspeaker. The AEC with adaptive filtering technique will more accurately enhance the speech quality in hands-free and teleconferencing communication systems. The focus is on speech enhancement of speech signal with reverberated signal in handsfree speech communication using AEC with adaptive filtering technique. There are many adaptive algorithms available in the literature for echo cancellation and every algorithm have its own properties, but the aim of algorithms using for echo cancellation is to achieve higher ERLE(amount of echo cancelled) in dB at a higher rate of convergence with low complexity. The adaptive algorithms NLMS, APA and RLS for echo cancellation were successfully implemented in MATLAB. The three algorithms for AEC are tested with simulation in three different echo occurring environments by changing microphone position, source position and room dimensions. The performance evaluation of the NLMS, APA and RLS algorithms are measured with ERLE parameter. The results show that the RLS algorithm have good performance with high rate of convergence speed but the computational complexity is high which makes it impractical in real time applications. The amount of echo cancellation with APA algorithm is higher than NLMS with less computational complexity than RLS and easy to implement in real time. The amount of echo cancellation with NLMS is low when compared to RLS and APA but it is easy to implement in real time with less computational complexity. The detailed view of the comparison results of three algorithms at three different environments are shown in section 6...|$|E
50|$|An {{echo chamber}} is a hollow {{enclosure}} {{used to produce}} <b>reverberated</b> <b>sounds,</b> usually for recording purposes. For example, the producers of a television or radio program might wish to produce the aural illusion that a conversation {{is taking place in}} a large room or a cave; these effects might be accomplished by playing the recording of the conversation inside an echo chamber, with an accompanying microphone to catch the reverberation. Nowadays effects units are more widely used to create such effects, but echo chambers are still used today, such as the famous echo chambers at Capitol Studios.|$|R
