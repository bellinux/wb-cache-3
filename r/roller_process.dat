50|$|Between 1870 and 1872, Stevens tried {{a number}} of models, {{including}} wooden rollers, but became convinced that rollers made from steel would best provide the type of cracking necessary. In order to prove the point, Stevens needed an actual device and he had some difficulty finding a machine shop who could manufacture steel rolls that had sufficient length and diameter, eventually employing the firm of Farrell and Sons in Ansonia, Connecticut. Once the rolls were made, Stevens developed systems to feed the wheat into the rolls, and he optimized the yield by experimenting with speeds and roller-to-roller distances.

40|$|Seventh International Symposium on Precision Mechanical Measurements, Xia'men, China, August 8, 2015 Precision roller with microstructures {{is the key}} tooling {{component}} in the precision embossing by <b>roller</b> <b>process</b> such as Roll-to-Roll to manufacture optical plastic plates or films with three dimensional (3 D) -microstructures. Measurement and analysis of 3 D-microstructures on a precision roller is essential before the embossing process is being undertaken {{to ensure the quality}} of the embossed surfaces. Different from 3 D-microstructures on a planar surface, it is difficult to measure and characterize the 3 D-microstructures on the cylindrical surface of a precision roller due to the geometrical complexity of such integrated surfaces such as V-groove microstructures on a cylindrical surface. This paper presents a study of method and algorithms for the measurement and characterization of 3 D-microstructures on a precision roller surface. A feature-based characterization method (FBCM) is proposed to analyze the V-groove microstructures. In this method, a normal template is generated based on the design specifications, and the measured data is fitted with the feature points. Hence alignment and matching of the measured data to the normal template based on the derived feature points are undertaken. After that the V-groove is characterized by some feature parameters such as pitch, depth, angle of the V-grooves. The method also provides an approach for the analysis of burs generated during the machining of Vgroove microstructures. A precision roller with V-groove microstructures has been machined by a Four-axis ultraprecision machine and the machined surface is measured by a contact measuring instrument. The measured data are then characterized and analyzed by the proposed FBCM. The results are presented and discussed, and they indicate the dominant and regular machining errors that are involved in the machining of the V-groove microstructures on roller surfaces.

In this paper, a pragmatic method in determining this variability of in-line NIR monitoring <b>roller</b> compaction <b>process</b> was developed and the variability limits were established. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis was used to study the source of the systematic fluctuations of the NIR spectra.

The eccentricity of the rolling motion of rollers was identified as the major source of variability and correlated with the fluctuations of the slopes of NIR spectra.
