In this study, we used confocal microscopy {{to investigate the}} distribution pattern of Ca 2 + and its dynamic changes in the processes of bovine oocytes maturation, in vitro fertilization (IVF), parthenogenetic activation (PA) and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) embryo development. During the germinal vesicle (GV) and GV breakdown stage, Ca 2 + was distributed in the cortical ooplasm and throughout the oocytes from the MI to MII stage. In IVF embryos, Ca 2 + was distributed in the cortical ooplasm before {{the formation of the}} pronucleus. In 4 - 8 cell embryos and morulas, Ca 2 + was present throughout the blastomere. In PA embryos, Ca 2 + was distributed throughout the blastomere at 48 h, similar to in the 4 -cell and 8 -cell phase and the morula. At 6 h after activation, there was almost no distribution of Ca 2 + in the SCNT embryos. However, Ca 2 + was distributed in the donor nucleus at 10 h and it was distributed throughout the blastomere in the 2 - 8 cell embryos. In this study, Ca 2 + showed significant fluctuations with regularity of IVF and SCNT groups, but PA did not.

The importance of cell cycle phase during the nuclear transfer has been a matter of debate since the first mammalian clone was produced. The cell cycle phase of donor cells interferes on maintenance of correct ploidy and genetic reprogramming of the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>embryo.</b> The use of G 0 /G 1 arrested donor cells has been shown to improve nuclear transfer efficiency. The present study was conducted to test the hypothesis that domestic cat foetal fibroblasts cultured up to the fifth passage and submitted to full confluency provide a higher percentage of cells at G 0 /G 1 stage than fibroblasts cultured in serum starved media. Results demonstrated that serum starvation increased (p < 0. 05) the percentage of G 0 /G 1 fibroblasts when compared with control. Moreover, the combined protocol using confluency and serum starvation was more efficient (p < 0. 05) synchronizing cells at G 0 /G 1 stage than serum starvation or confluency alone for the first 3 days of treatment.

All blastomeres and NT-embryos were cultured individually in modified Ham's F- 10 medium supplemented with 10 % rabbit serum (RS) at 38 degreesC and 5 % CO 2 in air. The diameter of blastomeres from 16 -cell stage embryos was found twice of those from 32 -cell stage (51 vs 27 pm). Significant differences were observed in cleavage rates (greater {{than or equal to}} 3 divisions) in the isolated single blastomeres (54 vs 48 for 16 -cell; 28 vs 14 for 32 -cell, p 0. 05). In conclusion, it appeared that no difference in the developmental competence between large and small isolated blastomeres was observed. When smaller 16 -cell stage blastomeres were used as nuclear donor, the cleavage rate or development of NT-embryos was improved and was compromised when 32 -cell stage blastomeres were used.

Here, the level of MPF and the distribution of cyclin B 1 were assessed in porcine oocytes following DEM treatment. In addition, the efficiencies of DEM-assisted and mechanical enucleation were compared, as were the development (in vitro and in vivo) of these oocytes following SCNT. MPF was uniformly distributed in oocytes that had been treated with 0. 4 mg/ml DEM for 1 h. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that in untreated oocytes, cyclin B 1, the regulatory subunit of MPF, accumulated around the spindle, and was lowly detected in the cytoplasm. DEM treatment disrupted spindle microtubules, induced chromosome condensation, and reduced the level of cyclin B 1 in the nuclear region. Cyclin B 1 was uniformly distributed in DEM-treated oocytes and the level of MPF was increased. The potential of embryos generated from DEM-treated oocytes to develop in vivo was significantly greater than that of embryos generated from mechanically enucleated oocytes.

Heterozygosity of the donor ES cell genome has been suggested as a crucial factor for long-term survival of cloned mice. In the present study, an inbred ES cell line, HM- 1 (129 /Ola), and a well-tested ES cell line, R 1 (129 /Sv × 129 /Sv-CP), were used as donor cells to evaluate the developmental potential of nuclear transfer embryos. We found that ES cell confluence dramatically affects the developmental potential of <b>reconstructed</b> <b>embryos.</b> With the ES cell line HM- 1 and 80 - 90 % confluence, 49 % of <b>reconstructed</b> <b>embryos</b> developed to the morula/blastocyst stage, 9 % of these embryos developed to live pups when transferred to the surrogate mothers, and 5 of 18 live pups survived to adulthood.

40|$|AbstractNuclei of {{differentiated}} {{cells can}} acquire totipotency following transfer into the cytoplasm of oocytes. While the molecular {{basis of this}} nuclear reprogramming remains unknown, the developmental potential of nuclear-transfer embryos {{is influenced by the}} cell-cycle stage of both donor and recipient. As somatic H 1 becomes immunologically undetectable on bovine embryonic nuclei following transfer into ooplasm and reappears during development of the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>embryo,</b> suggesting that it may act as a marker of nuclear reprogramming, we investigated the link between cell-cycle state and depletion of immunoreactive H 1 following nuclear transplantation. Blastomere nuclei at M-, G 1 -, or G 2 -phase were introduced into ooplasts at metaphase II, telophase II, or interphase, and the reconstructed embryos were processed for immunofluorescent detection of somatic histone H 1. Immunoreactivity was lost more quickly from donor nuclei at metaphase than at G 1 or G 2. Regardless of the stage of the donor nucleus, immunoreactivity was lost most rapidly when the recipient cytoplast was at metaphase and most slowly when the recipient was at interphase. When the recipient oocyte was not enucleated, however, immunoreactive H 1 remained in the donor nucleus. The phosphorylation inhibitors 6 -DMAP, roscovitine, and H 89 inhibited the depletion of immunoreactive H 1 from G 2, but not G 1, donor nuclei. In addition, immunoreactive H 1 was depleted from mouse blastomere nuclei following transfer into bovine oocytes. Finally, expression of the developmentally regulated gene, eIF- 1 A, but not of Gapdh, was extinguished in metaphase recipients but not in interphase recipients. These results indicate that evolutionarily conserved cell-cycle-regulated activities, nuclear elements, and phosphorylation-linked events participate in the depletion of immunoreactive histone H 1 from blastomere nuclei transferred in oocyte cytoplasm and that this is linked to changes in gene expression in the transferred nucleus...|$|E

In this study, we have compared the two most common procedures for transferring nuclei to enucleated oocytes - cell fusion (CF) and piezoelectric microinjection (PEM) using different somatic cells - and we have investigated the effect of different activation procedures. Granulosa cells and fibroblasts were grown to confluency or in low serum to induce a quiescent state, while lymphocytes were thawed immediately prior to use. Enucleated oocytes were reconstructed either with CF or PME by 21 - 23 h postmaturation. For cell fusion, one pulse of 1 kVolt/cm for 30 μsec was used; for PEM, the cell membrane was broken by repeated pipetting and transferred in a 12 % PVP solution to facilitate injection. Manipulated oocytes were activated with ionomycin and cycloheximide (CHX) or 6 -DMAP (DMAP) and cultured in microdrops of SOF-BSA-AA. On day 7 (day 0 : nuclear transfer), embryo development was evaluated and embryos were either transferred fresh or were frozen. More embryos were successfully reconstructed with PEM than CF, but a higher number of reconstructed embryos by CF developed to blastocyst at D + 7. In addition, in both systems more embryos were obtained after activation with DMAP than with CHX. The transfer of 141 embryos to recipients resulted in a pregnancy rate of 50 %, and no differences were observed between the source of donor cell, the reconstruction methods, or the activation protocol.

40|$|Somatic cell nuclear transfer, an {{important}} approach {{for the analysis}} of certain functional changes in the genome during differentiation and for many practical applications, is in general a low-efficiency procedure, mainly due to a low effectivity in the re-establishment of the developmental program in the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>embryo.</b> The process of reprogramming is, however, poorly understood and some additional studies are clearly necessary. The aim of this study was the ultrastructural and immunofluorescent (B 23 -nucleophosmin) evaluation of somatic (cumulus) cell nuclei reprogramming after their transfer into intact immature mouse oocytes, kept at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage (dbcAMP) during the whole culture. Control somatic cells and nuclear transfer-reconstructed embryos (1 and 24 h after fusion induced by polyethyleneglycol) were fixed for transmission electron mcroscopy (TEM) in 2. 5 % glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in 1 % OsO 4, dehydrated through an ethanol series, and embedded in epoxy resin. Finally, ultrathin sections were stained with uranyl acetate followed by lead citrate. The above reagents were purchased from Electron Microscopy Sciences (Hatfield, PA, USA). In parallel, we have evaluated immunocytochemically the pattern of B 23 labelling in intact and reconstructed cells. The samples were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde, incubated with an antibody against B 23 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) and then with a biotinylated secondary antibody, and detected by fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) -coupled Streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Cambridgeshire, UK). Mouse cumulus cells (12 / 12) contain a reticulated fibrillogranular nucleolus. The cell are also positively labeled with the anti-B 23 antibody. One hour after fusion, the introduced nuclei displayed shape modifications and nuclear envelope irregularities, whereas the nucleolus still showed the typical fibrillar pattern (19 / 19). The volume of transferred nuclei remains unchanged. Interestingly, while the oocyte nucleolus remains negative for B 23, the nucleoli in transferred somatic cells were always positively labeled (45 cells). After 24 h, the transferred nuclei increased their volume up to two-three times and displayed an irregular shape with nucleoli still possessing the unchanged reticulated pattern (17 / 17). As in the previous experimental interval, only the somatic cell nucleus remained labeled with the anti-B 23 antibody (52 cells). The GV oocyte nucleoli remained unchanged during the whole culture period, exhibiting the typical dense-fibrillar pattern. Our results showed that the immature oocyte cytoplasm possesses a limited remodelling activity. Interestingly, the evident increase in volume of transferred somatic cells indicated some changes but TEM morphology and B 23 labeling pattern remained basically unchanged. We cannot, however, exclude the beneficial effect upon reprogramming if these nuclei were subsequently used for the transfer into definitive cytoplasts. [ [...] . ...|$|E

One morphologically normal bucardo female was obtained by caesarean section. The newborn died some minutes after birth due to physical defects in lungs.

40|$|Somatic cell nuclear {{transfer}} (SCNT) {{is an important}} method of breeding quality varieties, expanding groups, and preserving endangered species. However, the viability of SCNT embryos is poor, and the cloned rate of animal production is low in pig. This study aims to investigate the gene function and establish a disease model of Banna miniature inbred pig. SCNT with donor cells derived from fetal, newborn, and adult fibroblasts was performed, and the cloning efficiencies among the donor cells were compared. The {{results showed that the}} cleavage and blastocyst formation rates did not significantly differ between the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>embryos</b> derived from the fetal (74. 3 % and 27. 4 %) and newborn (76. 4 % and 21. 8 %) fibroblasts of the Banna miniature inbred pig (P> 0. 05). However, both fetal and newborn fibroblast groups showed significantly higher rates than the adult fibroblast group (61. 9 % and 13. 0 %; P< 0. 05). The pregnancy rates of the recipients in the fetal and newborn fibroblast groups (60 % and 80 %, respectively) were higher than those in the adult fibroblast group. Eight, three, and one cloned piglet were obtained from <b>reconstructed</b> <b>embryos</b> of the fetal, newborn, and adult fibroblasts, respectively. Microsatellite analyses results indicated that the genotypes of all cloning piglets were identical to their donor cells and that the genetic homozygosity of the Banna miniature inbred pig was higher than those of the recipients. Therefore, the offspring was successfully cloned using the fetal, newborn, and adult fibroblasts of Banna miniature inbred pig as donor cells...|$|R
30|$|Porcine induced pluripotency {{stem cells}} (piPSCs) are promised in basic research, animal {{husbandry}} and regenerative medicine. However, {{the efficiency of}} the piPSCs induction has been low and the generated piPSCs varied in cell morphology and cell characteristics. Here we report a novel approach to improve efficiency of piPSCs generation. The induced piPSCs are dome-shaped mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs)-like and display molecular properties of mouse ESCs. Electroporation study reveals that mouse ESCs-like status facilitates genetic manipulating of piPSCs. Importantly, we demonstrate that the domed piPSC colonies are more suitable as donor cells for nuclear transfer (NT) to generate <b>reconstructed</b> <b>embryos</b> than those flattened piPSCs. The potential applications of the newly generated piPSCs in ungulate pluripotent research are discussed.|$|R

In the present study, we focused on two major epigenetic marks, DNA methylation and histone H 3 lysine 9 (H 3 K 9) acetylation, which we examined by indirect immuno-fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy.

40|$|Although the pig is {{considered}} an important model of human disease and an ideal animal for the preclinical testing of cell transplantation, the utility of this model has been hampered {{by a lack of}} genuine porcine embryonic stem cells. Here, we derived a porcine pluripotent stem cell (pPSC) line from day 5. 5 blastocysts in a newly developed culture system based on MXV medium and a 5 % oxygen atmosphere. The pPSCs had been passaged more than 75 times over two years, and the morphology of the colony was similar to that of human embryonic stem cells. Characterization and assessment showed that the pPSCs were alkaline phosphatase (AKP) positive, possessed normal karyotypes and expressed classic pluripotent markers, including OCT 4, SOX 2 and NANOG. In vitro differentiation through embryonic body formation and in vivo differentiation via teratoma formation in nude mice demonstrated that the pPSCs could differentiate into cells of the three germ layers. The pPSCs transfected with fuw-DsRed (pPSC-FDs) could be passaged with a stable expression of both DsRed and pluripotent markers. Notably, when pPSC-FDs were used as donor cells for somatic nuclear transfer, 11. 52 % of the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>embryos</b> developed into blastocysts, which was not significantly {{different from that of the}} <b>reconstructed</b> <b>embryos</b> derived from porcine embryonic fibroblasts. When pPSC-FDs were injected into day 4. 5 blastocysts, they became involved in the in vitro embryonic development and contributed to the viscera of foetuses at day 50 of pregnancy as well as the developed placenta after the chimeric blastocysts were transferred into recipients. These findings indicated that the pPSCs were porcine pluripotent cells; that this would be a useful cell line for porcine genetic engineering and a valuable cell line for clarifying the molecular mechanism of pluripotency regulation in pigs...|$|R
40|$|Somatic cell nuclear {{transfer}} (SCNT) {{has been used}} in crucial and potential fields of the animal reproduction. Despite the successful birth of cloned animals, the cloning efficiency of SCNT has been still low. Abnormal epigenetic reprogramming has been reported as the cause of the low efficiency of SCNT in cloned embryos. Here, the study aimed to improve the developmental competence of porcine SCNT embryos using Trichostatin A (TSA) and Scriptaid which are well known as histone deacetylase inhibitors that would enhance epigenetic reprograming in cloned embryos by suppressing the event of histone deacetylation. Moreover, this study tested whether Scriptaid would be a substitute for TSA because {{it has been suggested that}} TSA is involved in malformation of cloned embryos. Various concentrations of Scriptaid were tested and 500 nM Scriptaid treatment resulted in a significant improvement of the cloned embryo during development regarding the blastocyst formation rates. When cloned embryos were treated with 50 nM TSA or/and 500 nM Scriptaid for 15 h or 24 h, the blastocyst rates of <b>reconstructed</b> <b>embryos</b> were increased in comparison to the untreated control group. However, there was no dose–dependent difference among groups. When donor cells were treated with 50 nM TSA or/and 500 nM Scriptaid for 4 h the blastocyst rates of <b>reconstructed</b> <b>embryos</b> were increased in comparison with the untreated control group. Moreover the expression levels of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC 1) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC 2) were decreased with TSA and/or Scriptaid treatment. In conclusion, TSA and/or Scriptaid treatments significantly increased the developmental competence of porcine SCNT embryos. In addition, Scriptaid improved the development of SCNT embryos regardless of the TSA treatment. Therefore, Scriptaid would be an alternative additive to improve the development competence of cloned embryos after SCNT...|$|R

Our developmental studies consist of nuclear exchange between lamb oocytesdivided in two groups: first, with diameter equal to adult oocytes, and second, smaller than adultones. Al 1 reconstructed MI 1 oocytes were fertilized by ICSI and cultured in vitro ti 11 the blastocyststage. Using this approach we revealed that when lamb oocytes smaller fiom adult ones were usedfor nuclear transfer, the development of <b>reconstructed</b> <b>embryos</b> in both groups was blocked beforethe blastocyst stage while surprisingly the embryo progression of embryos generated fiom nuclearexchange between equal in diameter oocytes recovered from adult and lamb donor was significantlydifferent for adult- and lamb-nucleus derived embryos (18 % vs. O%, respectively). The ability toprogress to the blastocyst stage was maintained only for <b>embryos</b> <b>reconstructed</b> with adult nucleus. These results demonstrated that smaller oocytes lack both, cytoplasmic and nuclear competentewhile those reaching the diameter equal to adults are still incompetent in term of nuclearpreparation. Further observation of nucleolar ultrastructure revealed fibrillogranular materia 1 indicative for transcriptional activity in smaller oocytes. Altogether, our developmental andmorphological studies support evidence for uncompleted nuclear maturation in prepubertal oocytes. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Nuclear transfer-embryonic {{stem cells}} (NT-ESCs) are genetically {{identical}} to the donor’s cells; provide a renewable source of tissue for replacement, and therefore, decrease the risk of immune rejection.

40|$|The {{introduction}} of cell nuclei into enucleated recipient cells (Metaphase II oocytes), besides enucleation, {{is the most}} significant stage of so-matic cloning procedure.
