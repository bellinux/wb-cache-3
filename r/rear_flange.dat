[...] , An {{increased}} life-of-type {{requirement for}} Mirage t 1 fO- aircraft {{operated by the}} Soyal-Australiaa-Air-rc#-AAFY-was associated with a specific {{need to develop a}} refurbishment technique for extending the lives of fatigue-cracked wing main spars. This led to a comprehensive series of flight-by. flight fatigue tests on specimens of e geometry and thickness (32 mm) closely representing the inboard lower <b>rear</b> <b>flange</b> section of the [...] spar. Of the various options investigated, the most promising was the use of interference-fit steel bushes in bolt holes-either alone or in combination with a modified anchor-nut sub-assembly which eliminated the need for some rivets in the spar flange.

40|$|An {{integrated}} {{thermal protection}} system (TPS) for a spacecraft includes a grid that is bonded to {{skin of the}} spacecraft, e. g., to support the structural loads of the spacecraft. A plurality of thermally insulative, relatively large panels are positioned on the grid to cover {{the skin of the}} spacecraft to which the grid has been bonded. Each panel includes a rounded front edge and a front flange depending downwardly from the front edge. Also, each panel includes a rear edge formed with a rounded socket for receiving the rounded front edge of another panel therein, and a respective <b>rear</b> <b>flange</b> depends downwardly from each rear edge. Pins are formed on the front flanges, and pin receptacles are formed on the rear flanges, such that the pins of a panel mechanically interlock with the receptacles of the immediately forward panel. To reduce the transfer to the skin of heat which happens to leak through the panels to the grid, the grid includes stringers that are chair-shaped in cross-section...|$|E
40|$|A blade {{alignment}} {{mechanism for}} an ice skate including a clamp for releasably securing the blade assembly to a skating boot {{in a trial}} position. The clamp includes a first member secured to the boot at a point remote from the screw apertures in the front or <b>rear</b> <b>flanges,</b> and a second member attached to the first member and disposed to contact one of the flanges {{to hold it in}} a trial position. The second member includes an enlarged adjustment opening that allows side-to-side and fore-and-aft adjustment of the second member with respect to the first member. The first and second members are locked into the selected trial position by tightening a threaded fastener that draws contacting serrated faces of the first and second members together. Thus, the blade assembly is releasably attached to the boot in a trial position for trial use by the skater...|$|R

The problem originated at the Lotus assembly line, where the Roadster glider was built. Lotus also recalled some Elise and Exige vehicles for the same reason.|$|R
40|$|In {{the frame}} of the EFDA task HCD- 08 - 03 - 01, a 5 GHz Lower Hybrid system being able to deliver 20 MW CW on ITER and sustains the {{expected}} high heat flux has been reviewed. The design of the key RF elements of the antenna such as the Passive-Active Multijunction (PAM), TE 10 -TE 30 mode converter, 3 dB splitter and RF window has been updated. Overall dimensions have been updated from the 2005 design in collaboration with ITER organization. ITER mechanical constraints, such as the port plug size or the <b>rear</b> <b>flange</b> have been taken into account since the initial RF design. The main parallel index has been chosen to be n//= 2. 0 with a flexibility of [1. 8 - 2. 2] in order to maximize the current drive efficiency. In parallel to the RF design, the coupling to the plasma has been studied with the ALOHA and TOPLHA codes and results are in good agreement. The antenna is made of 48 identical modules, 12 on the toroidal direction and 4 on the poloidal direction. Each module is terminated by a RF window located inside the frame and connected to a poloidal 3 dB splitter which feeds 2 TE 10 -TE 30 mode converters. Each of these mode converters divides the power into 3 poloidal rows corresponding to the input of a 4 active waveguides multijunction. An optimization of the multijunction and the mode converter has been made in order to reduce VSWR and total length in order to satisfy the ITER frame constraints. 5 GHz CW RF windows capable of sustaining 500 kW {{are one of the most}} challenging RF devices of this antenna, since the ceramic which separates the tokamak vacuum from the pressurized transmission line must handle and evacuate high RF power density flux. Different designs have been proposed based on pill-box geometry and actively water cooled. Efficient designs ensuring low theoretical return loss and acceptable dielectric RF losses for beryllium oxide (BeO) window has been found. All the devices which have been separately studied have been integrated together, allowing a RF characterization of the whole antenna and further optimization for neutron shielding...|$|E

50|$|Over time, {{the number}} of {{sprockets}} in a cogset has increased, from three or four before World War II, to five used from the 1950s to the 1970s, up to the eight, nine, ten, eleven, or twelve now found on modern bikes. As more rear sprockets were added, the combination became wider, and the sprocket spacing narrower. One {{of the ways to}} make space for this was the axle length (measured as the Over Locknut Distance — O.L.D.) was increased, necessitating more dish on the rear wheel drive side with a threaded hub to centre the wheel in the frame. The hub flanges spacing was not shortened on threaded hubs, rather the axle length increased from 120 mm O.L.D. (five-speed/compact six) to 126 mm O.L.D. (six-speed/compact seven) through to 130 mm O.L.D. (threaded seven-speed) for a road bike. MTB rear spacing is normally 135 mm O.L.D. Another advantage of the Shimano cassette hubs introduced from 1978 was that the <b>rear</b> hub <b>flanges</b> were wider apart than those of a threaded hub, so built a stronger wheel with less dish and without the problem of increased bearing stress or axle failure.|$|R
40|$|Performance {{and wear}} {{behaviour}} of hard coated cutting tools prepared {{in the frame}} of a joint project by (Ti, Al) N-PVD, TiN-Al_ 2 O_ 3 -TiN-PCVD and TiN-PCVD of cermets were studied in turning and milling processes under real conditions of production of a broad range of components and materials. In the production of articulation rings (steel for hardening and tempering Cf 53), of backward bushes (steel 16 MnCr 5) and of <b>rear</b> axle shaft <b>flanges</b> (steel 28 Cr 4 V) a tool wear reduction of high as 50 % was achieved. In some other cases, e. g. in the machining of forge crusts for the manufacturing of differential bevel gears, no improvement was obtained. In this latter case the life cycle was not determined by wear but by tool fracture.

40|$|The ITER Ion Cyclotron Range of Frequencies (ICRF) antenna's {{capacity}} to couple power to plasma {{is determined by}} the plasma Scrape-Off Layer (SOL) profile, shaping of the front strap array, layout of the Port Plug (PP) and detailed design of its RF components. The first two factors are taken into account by the Torino Polytechnic Ion Cyclotron Antenna (TOPICA) calculated strap array Scattering/Impedance 24 -port (S 24 × 24 −/Z 24 × 24 −) matrices, while this paper deals with the optimisation of the PP layout and components. The RF modeling techniques are explained and used to maximise the coupled power under a set of constraints on RF quantities inside the PP. The total PP RF surface conductive and volumetric dielectric losses are calculated. The resulting S-parameters at the <b>rear</b> RF PP <b>flanges</b> are evaluated as input for the design of the pre-match, decoupling and matching network outside the PP. A discussion of the effect of errors on the PP excitation on the coupled power is also include...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{contract}} was to provide optomechanical engineering and fabrication support to the Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) program {{in the areas of}} mirror, optical bench and camera assemblies of the telescope. The Center for Applied Optics (CAO) worked closely with the Optics and S&E technical staff of MSFC to develop and investigate the most viable and economical options for the design and fabrication of a number of parts for the various telescope assemblies. All the tasks under this delivery order have been successfully completed within budget and schedule. A number of development hardware parts have been designed and fabricated jointly by MSFC and UAH for the engineering model of SXI. The major parts include a nickel electroformed mirror and a mirror mount, plating and coating of the ceramic spacers, and gold plating of the contact rings and fingers for the camera assembly. An aluminum model of the high accuracy sun sensor (HASS) was also designed and fabricated. A number of fiber optic tapers for the camera assembly were also coated with indium tin oxide and phosphor for testing and evaluation by MSFC. A large number of the SXI optical bench parts were also redesigned and simplified for a prototype telescope. These parts include the forward and <b>rear</b> support <b>flanges,</b> front aperture plate, the graphite epoxy optical bench and a test fixture for the prototype telescope. More than fifty (50) drawings were generated for various components of the prototype telescope. Some of these parts were subsequently fabricated at UAH machine shop or at MSFC or by the outside contractors. UAH also provide technical support to MSFC staff for a number of preliminary and critical design reviews. These design reviews included PDR and CDR for the mirror assembly by United Technologies Optical Systems (UTOS), and the program quarterly reviews, and SXI PDR and CDR. UAH staff also regularly attended the monthly status reviews, and made a significant number of suggestions to improve the design, assembly and alignment of the telescope. Finally, a high level assembly and alignment plan for the entire telescope was prepared by UAH. This plan addresses the sequence of assembly, the required assembly and alignment tolerances, and the methods to verify the alignment at each step during the assembly process. This assembly and alignment plan will be used to assemble and integrate the engineering model (EM) of the telescope. Later on, based on this plan more detailed assembly and alignment procedures will be developed for the lower-level assemblies of SXI...|$|R
