40|$|Rugby league coaches often {{prescribe}} {{training to}} replicate the demands of competition. The intensities of running drills are often monitored in comparison with absolute match-play measures. Such measures may not be sensitive enough to detect fluctuations in intensity across a match or to differentiate between positions. Purpose: To determine the position- and duration-specific running intensities of rugby league competition, using a moving-average method, for the prescription and monitoring of training. Methods: Data from a 15 -Hz global positioning system (GPS) were collected from 32 professional rugby league players across a season. The velocity-time curve was analyzed using a rolling-average method, where maximum values were calculated for 10 different durations, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 min, for each player across each match. Results: There were large differences between the 1 - and 2 -min <b>rolling</b> <b>averages</b> and all other rolling-average durations. Smaller differences were observed for <b>rolling</b> <b>averages</b> of greater duration. Fullbacks maintained a greater velocity than outside backs and middle and edge forwards over the 1 - and 2 -min <b>rolling</b> <b>averages</b> (ES 0. 8 - 1. 2, P <. 05). For <b>rolling</b> <b>averages</b> 3 min and greater, the running demands of the fullbacks were greater {{than those of the}} middle forwards and outside backs (ES 1. 1 - 1. 4, P <. 05). Conclusions: These findings suggest that the running demands of rugby league fluctuate vastly across a match. Fullbacks were the only position to exhibit a greater running intensity than any other position, and therefore training prescription should reflect this...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} from an {{extensive}} {{study on the}} benefits of rolling window and model averaging. Building on the recent work on <b>rolling</b> window <b>averaging</b> by Pesaran et al (2010, 2009) and on exchange rate forecasting by Molodtsova and Papell (2009), we explore whether <b>rolling</b> window <b>averaging</b> can be considered beneficial on a priori grounds, that is whether researchers can use it to improve forecasting performance and to avoid ‘window mining’ in short horizons. In addition, we investigate whether <b>rolling</b> window <b>averaging</b> can improve the performance of model averaging, especially when ‘simpler’ models are being used. Our results provide strong support for <b>rolling</b> window <b>averaging,</b> outperforming the best window forecasts more than 50 % of the time across all rolling windows considered – with the outperformance being statistically significant. Furthermore, <b>rolling</b> window <b>averaging</b> smoothes out the forecast path and improves robustness of the forecasting model, thus minimizing the pitfalls associated with potential structural breaks. An illustrative simulation supports the proposed improvement with the double averaging approach. Afterwards the technique is applied in three datasets: exchange rates for 12 OECD countries, US inflation rate and US output growth rate. For exchange rates, we use the dataset of Molodtsova and Papell (2009) and replicate their analysis by considering rolling window and model averaging. The results reveal <b>rolling</b> window <b>averaging</b> can further improve the performance of the models and, in addition, when combined with model averaging brings forth the forecasting ability of ‘simpler’ economic models of exchange rates. With respect to US inflation and output growth forecasting, we again find that <b>rolling</b> window <b>averaging</b> outperforms the best individual window forecasts by more than 50 % of the time, with significant differences from the benchmarks, and helps in model averaging by bringing forth the predictive power of economic variables in parsimonious models. ...|$|R

The spreadsheet {{can be used to}} manage the future flow of pigs on a given farm. A model of the component parts of pigs weaned per week was used to determine the relative impact of each production parameter. The farrowing rate, litter size, and preweaning mortality had little impact on the variation of pigs weaned per week. The numbers of sows served explained 62 % of the variation in pigs weaned per week. We recommend that producers keep the numbers of sows served within a farm-specific minimum and maximum to produce a steady flow of pigs through the system. This will require an adequate gilt pool for weeks when there are too few sows in estrus, and will require that producers allow sows to remain open for another estrus cycle if the maximum number of sows has been served for the week...|$|R

50|$|In {{the first}} years of {{operation}} at Mount Isa, the throughput of the ISASMELT furnace was constrained by problems with some of the ancillary equipment in the plant, including the boiler, slag granulation system and concentrate filters. The ultimate constraint was the decision during its construction to keep one of the two reverberatory furnaces on line to increase the copper smelter production to 265,000 t/y of anode copper. The smelter’s Peirce-Smith converters became a bottleneck and the feed rate of the ISASMELT furnace had to be restrained to allow sufficient matte to be drawn from the reverberatory furnace to prevent it freezing solid. The ISASMELT 12-month <b>rolling</b> <b>average</b> of the feed rate fell just short of 100 t/h for much of this period, not quite reaching the design annual average of 104 t/h.

40|$|Mixed model {{methodology}} and recursive estimation techniques (Kalman filter) were combined to detect {{significant changes in}} the performance level of both individual cows and an entire herd. Yields were predicted for the next time of recording using all data available up to that time. Predicted yields were compared with actual measurements. If the error of prediction, or innovation, exceeded ± 2 times its standard deviation, the observation was considered to be significantly different from the former yield level. The data comprised 30, 199 records for 135 cows and 366 d. Effects fitted in the model were test day, breed, and lactation class as fixed effects and cow within lactation number as a random effect. A lactation curve was fitted within lactation class. Of the observed milk yields, 9. 2 % deviated significantly from the expected value in a negative direction. None of the innovation of the fixed-day effect exceeded the threshold of two standard deviations. Compared with the results of <b>rolling</b> <b>average,</b> which were calculated as the average of a 10 -d period, over 20 % of the observations of the daily milk yield were classified differently by the two methods.
