5|$|Originally {{designed}} to create dynamic web pages, PHP now focuses mainly on server-side scripting, and it is similar to other server-side scripting languages that provide dynamic content from a web server to a client, such as Microsoft's Classic ASP, Sun Microsystems' JavaServer Pages, and mod_perl. PHP has also attracted the development of many software frameworks that provide building blocks and a design structure to promote <b>rapid</b> <b>application</b> <b>development</b> (RAD). Some of these include PRADO, CakePHP, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Yii Framework, Phalcon and Zend Framework, offering features similar to other web frameworks.|$|E

2500|$|Users {{build new}} stacks or modify extant ones by adding new cards. They place GUI objects on the cards using an {{interactive}} layout engine {{based on a}} simple drag-and-drop interface. Also, HyperCard included prototype or template cards termed backgrounds; when new cards are created they can refer {{to one of these}} background cards, which causes all of the objects on the background to be copied onto the new card. This way, a stack of cards with a common layout and functionality can be created. The layout engine is similar in concept to a [...] "form" [...] as used in most <b>rapid</b> <b>application</b> <b>development</b> (RAD) environments (such as Borland Delphi, and Microsoft Visual Basic and Visual Studio).|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Business process {{management}} (BPM) is {{moving from a}} niche market into the mainstream. One of the factors leading to this transformation {{is the emergence of}} very powerful rapid so-lutions development tools for creating BPM solutions (BPM RSD). It has been widely recognized that this facility is important for achieving benefits quickly. Similar benefits are attributed to the agile software movement, but BPM RSD differs in that the objective is to reduce the need for custom software development. As the BPM RSD features of some of the current business {{process management}} suites (BPMS) products have matured, additional benefits have emerged that fundamentally change the way we approach solutions in this space.

Using participatory action research, this paper investigates the potential for deploying a virtual learning environment as a CASE tool for the <b>development</b> of web-based <b>applications.</b> In this instance the final IT artefact is an operational prototype - the A/B Dashboard.
