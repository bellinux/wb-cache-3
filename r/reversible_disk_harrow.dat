Agricultural ecosystems can {{play a significant role}} in production and consumption of greenhouse gases, specifically, carbon dioxide. Information is needed on the mechanism and magnitude of gas generation and emission from agricultural soils with specific emphasis on tillage mechanisms. This work evaluated four different tillage methods on the short-term CO 2 and water vapor flux from a clay loam soil in the Northern Cornbelt of the USA. The four tillage methods were moldboard plow only, moldboard plow plus <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> twice, <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> and chisel plow using standard tillage equipment following a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop compared with no tillage. The CO 2 flux was measured with a large portable chamber commonly used to measure crop canopy gas exchange initiated within 5 minutes after tillage and continued intermittently for 19 days. The moldboard plow treatment buried nearly all of the residue and left the soil in a rough, loose, open condition and resulted in maximum CO 2 loss.

All experimental plots were irrigated with sprinklers, immediately after the pre-emergence application of herbicides, while later all plots were irrigated with either drip irrigation or mobile sprinklers. The herbicide treatments consisted of a broadcast preplant-incorporated (PPI) application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by pre-emergence (PRE) applied prometryn, a pre-emergence 38 cm band application of s-metolachlor + fluometuron and a broadcast PPI application of s-metolachlor followed by post-emergence applied trifloxysulfuron-sodium or pyrithiobac. The PPI application of s-metolachlor or trifluralin followed by PRE application of prometryn resulted the greatest control of redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.) and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). The efficacy of herbicides against common lambsquarters and black nightshade was slightly reduced when they were incorporated into the soil with the rotary harrow. Cotton plant emergence, number of bolls, boll opening and cotton lint yield were not affected in most cases by the tillage implement. Cotton lint yield in plots irrigated with drip irrigation was higher or equal with plots irrigated with sprinklers. The effect of three tillage implements (field cultivator, <b>disk</b> <b>harrow,</b> rotary harrow) and various herbicides was also evaluated in two field experiments conducted in Northern Greece during 2006 and 2007. Herbicide treatments included the pre-plant incorporation of s-metolachlor + fluometuron, trifluralin + fluometuron, ethalfluralin, pendimethalin + fluometuron, fluometuron. Irrigation with sprinklers was not made after cotton sowing. Cotton lint yield in plots treated with preplant incorporated s-metolachlor + fluometuron was equal to plots treated with trifluralin + fluometuron or pendimethalin + fluometuron, but significantly higher than plots treated with ethalfluralin or fluometuron.

The experiment was installed in the field on January 21, 2011 and lasted 260 days, in an area previously used as pasture with Brachiaria grass without liming or fertilization, but irrigated by a low pressure spray system. The treatments, in five replications and in a randomized block design, consisted of: 1) disk plow (twice) + <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> + ridge-furrow tillage (raising a ridge along the planting row), 135 days after transplanting (DP + RID); 2) disk plow (twice) + <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> (DP no RID); 3) subsoiler (SB); 4) disk plow (twice) + <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> + scarification with three shanks along the plant row (DP + SPR); and 5) disk plow (twice) + <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> + scarification with three shanks in the total area (DP + STA). In all tillage systems, furrows were mechanically opened for the papaya plants. After the treatments, the mechanical resistance to penetration was determined, followed by soil moisture, mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), bulk density (BD), macroporosity (Ma), microporosity (Mi), and number of fruits per plant. There were differences in penetration resistance (PR) between treatments. The subsoiler was more effective to decrease RP to a distance of 0. 35 m from the plants, perpendicular to the plant row. The scarifier resulted in a lower PR than DP or SB, even at the depth of 0. 40 m, and it was more effective at greater distances perpendicular to the plant. All tillage systems induced a PR between 2. 0 and 3. 0 MPa at the depth with the highest concentration of papaya tree roots (0 - 0. 25 m), improving the physical conditions to this depth. There was no statistical difference among the treatments for BD, Ma, Mi, MWD, and GMD at a depth of 0. 20 m. The disk plow changed the physical properties of the soil most intensely to a depth of 0. 20 m. The use of scarification, reduced tillage with a forest subsoiler, or ridge-furrow tillage did not improve the physical properties in the rhizosphere.

The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the operating performance of agricultural machines in the deployment of sorghum forage in four tillage systems, as follows: no-tillage system, <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> + seeding, <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> + two light disking + seeding, minimum tillage + seeding and four seeding different speeds, as follows: 3, 5, 6 and 9 km h(- 1). The study was performed under field conditions in FCA/UNESP, Botucatu County, SP, Brazil. The data were subjected to variance analysis in a simple factorial 4 x 4, and a random block design with split plots. Operational performance of the agricultural machinery, physical characteristics the soil, its water content and the yield of dry matter and green sorghum were determined. The operational performance of agricultural machines in the deployment of sorghum forage is influenced by the sowing speed and the soil tillage system used. Chisel plow was the equipment that required the highest mean traction force, mean traction and slip, as well as the lowest mean speed for the studied tillage system. Forage sorghum showed higher yields in no-tillage systems at a seeding speed of 5 km h(- 1) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} crop {{rotation}} systems (CRS) on soybean yield and agronomic characteristics were evaluated from 1996 / 1997 to 2010 / 2011 at Embrapa Trigo, Passo Fundo (RS), Brazil. Four soil management systems (SMS) were compared, namely: 1) no tillage, 2) minimum tillage, 3) conventional tillage using a disk plow and a <b>disk</b> <b>harrow,</b> and 4) conventional using a moldboard and a <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> - and three CRS: system I (wheat/soybean), system II (wheat/soybean and common vetch/corn or sorghum) and system III (wheat/soybean, white oats/soybean and common vetch/corn or sorghum). This is a split-plot, randomized, complete block design with three replications. SMS were assigned {{in the main}} plot and CRS systems in the split-plots. This work addressed only data on crop rotation systems. There {{were no significant differences}} between the CRS for number of grains per plant, 1, 000 grain weight and first pod height in soybean. The crop rotation for a summer, with corn or sorghum, propitiates a higher soybean yield compared with the other systems and monoculture soybean. The combination of conservation systems (no tillage and minimum tillage) and CR resulted in a higher soybean yield. The lowest grain yield and grain weight per plant were obtained in monoculture soybean...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to design, fabricate and test a prototype of sugar cane stubble saver based on powered disk mechanism. In this research, a heavy duty disk plow or <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> was used as a rotating knife to cut the sugarcane stubble. The parabolic disk was chosen because it is proven reliable as soil working tools and it is available in the market as spare part of disk plow or <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> unit. The prototype was mounted on the four wheel tractor 2 ̆ 7 s three point hitch, and powered by PTO of the tractor. Two kinds of disks were used in these experiments, those were disk with regular edge or plain disk and disk with scalloped edge or scalloped disk. Both disks had diameter of 28 inch. Results of field test showed that powered disk mechanism could satisfy cut sugar cane 2 ̆ 7 s stubble. However, scalloped disk type gave smoother stubble cuts compared to that of plain disk. Plain disk type gave broken stubble cut. Higher rotation (1000 rpm) resulted better cuts as compared to lower rotation (500 rpm) both either on plain disk and scalloped disk. The developed prototype could work below the soil surface at depth of 5 to 10 cm. With tilt angle setting 20 O and disk angle 45 O the width of cut was about 25 cm...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of canola (oilseed rape; Brassica napus L.) {{as a new}} source of vegetable oil production in Iran prompts evaluation of the performance of this crop under different tillage systems. A field experiment was conducted to determine the impact of depth and in-tensity of tillage on soil physical properties, crop establishment and yield of irrigated winter canola in a loam soil (Typic Haplargids) near Isfahan in central Iran. In a split-plot design, three primary tillage treatments consisted of moldboard plowing to 20 cm (MP 20), two passes of a cultivator first to 10 and then to 15 cm (2 TC 15), and one single pass of cultivator to 10 cm (TC 10), were combined with two seedbed preparation treatments (four passes with a <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> as opposed to a single pass with a rotary tiller). Results showed that the soil bulk density in the 0 - 5 and 5 - 10 cm layers were not significantly affected by primary tillage treatments. Soil penetration resistance (PR) in the 0 - 10 cm layer was significantly higher in 2 TC 15 compared to moldboard plowed soil; however, no significant effect of primary tillage was detected on PR in the 10 - 20 cm depth. A single pass by a rotary tiller was as effective in seedbed preparation as four passes of a <b>disk</b> <b>harrow,</b> as assessed by bulk density, penetra...|$|R

Therefore, this experiment was conducted in summer 2003 on clay soil containing wheat residual in Shawoor agricultural research center, situated in northern Ahwaz. Experiment was conducted as a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD). Treatments included: conventional tillage in one pass of moldboard plowing in 20 cm depth + leveler (T 1), two passes of <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> in 8 - 10 cm depth + leveler (T 2), two passes of <b>disk</b> <b>harrow</b> in 12 - 15 cm depth + leveler (T 3), one pass of cultivator in 10 cm depth + leveler (T 4), one pass of cultivator in 15 cm depth + leveler (T 5) and one pass of rotivator in 5 cm depth (T 6). The results showed that fuel consumption decreased for T 2 -T 6 57, 51, 67, 54 and 69 % as compared to T 1 (49 L/ha), respectively. Total operation time decrease in T 2 -T 6 42, 46, 42, 54 and 44 % in comparison to T 1 (4. 41 h/ha) respectively.
