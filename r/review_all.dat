5|$|The flag, when {{carried in}} a {{procession}} or parade or with another flag or flags, {{should be on the}} marching right or alone in the centre at the front. The flag may form a distinctive feature of the unveiling of a statue, monument, or plaque, but should never be used as the covering for the object. As a mark of respect to the flag, it should never be dipped to a person or thing, as opposed to regimental colours, organisational or institutional flags, which may be dipped as a mark of honour. During the ceremony of hoisting or lowering the flag, or when the flag is passing in a parade or in a <b>review,</b> <b>all</b> persons present should face the flag and stand at attention. Those present in uniform should render the appropriate salute. When the flag is in a moving column, persons present will stand at attention or salute as the flag passes them. A dignitary may take the salute without a head dress. The flag salutation should be followed by the playing of the national anthem.|$|E
5|$|While the Enterprise is {{en route}} to Pacifica on a {{scientific}} mission, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) receives a highly confidential message from an old friend, Captain Walker Keel (Jonathan Farwell) of the USS Horatio. Keel refuses to discuss his concerns, even though the frequency he is using {{is supposed to be}} a secure channel, and insists on a face-to-face meeting. Once they arrive at Dytallix B for this secret meeting, the crew discover the Horatio and two other Federation ships already present. Picard beams alone to the surface and is met by Captain Keel and the other captains. Keel reports strange orders from Starfleet headquarters and what he implies are suspicious deaths of Starfleet officers, and expresses concern of a conspiracy. Picard refuses to accept this without proof, but Keel warns him to remain wary. When the captain returns to the Enterprise, he is challenged by Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) about keeping his contact with Keel secret. Picard is skeptical about the conspiracy, but says that he trusts his old friend completely. The Enterprise resumes its previous journey. Picard has Commander Data (Brent Spiner) <b>review</b> <b>all</b> orders issued by Starfleet Command in the past six months. While the ship is still on its way to Pacifica, a disturbance is detected in nearby space. Upon investigating this, the Enterprise discovers a mass of debris that surely must be the shattered remains of the Horatio. Data completes his study and finds several strange orders from the senior levels of Starfleet. Picard informs his senior staff of the conspiracy theory, and orders the Enterprise to Earth.|$|E

25|$|On August 14, 1929, the Department of Public Works, {{under the}} {{administrative}} {{oversight of the}} State Engineer, which was later assumed by the Division of Safety of Dams, was given authority to <b>review</b> <b>all</b> non-federal dams over 25 feet high or which would hold more than 50 acre-feet of water. The new legislation also allowed the State to employ consultants, as they deemed necessary.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, {{the state}} {{mandated}} that rents for buildings built after January 1, 1974 be stabilized until May 15, 1985. Also, the state mandated that the New York City Board of Estimate <b>review</b> <b>all</b> local restrictions on 421-a benefits for approval. Next, the state passed laws that officially restricted benefits for projects in Manhattan.

25|$|The {{governor}} {{plays an}} active role within the judicial branch of Oklahoma government. Oklahoma has a Judicial Nominating Commission consisting of thirteen members that <b>review</b> <b>all</b> potential justices and judges of Oklahoma's appellate courts, such as the Oklahoma Supreme Court, and review them {{to determine if they}} qualify to hold their respective positions. Of these thirteen members, the governor appoints six without the consent of the Oklahoma Legislature. The governor's appointments serve for a term of six years each; the terms are staggered so that approximately one-third of the appointments become vacant every two years.|$|E
25|$|The best-known {{commentary}} on the Arba'ah Turim is the Beit Yosef by rabbi Joseph ben Ephraim Karo: this goes beyond the normal functions of a commentary, in that it attempts to <b>review</b> <b>all</b> the relevant authorities and come to a final decision on every point, so as to constitute a comprehensive resource on Jewish law. Other commentaries are Bayit Chadash by rabbi Joel Sirkis, Darkhei Moshe by Moses Isserles, Beit Yisrael (Perishah u-Derishah) by rabbi Joshua Falk, as well as works {{by a number of}} other Acharonim. These often defend the views of the Tur against the Beit Yosef.|$|E
25|$|Each {{institution}} and parole office forms the 'local committee' {{for which the}} CSC consult with on matters regarding correctional operations, programs, policies, and plans. They in turn participate in the regional committee (Atlantic, Quebec, Ontario, Prairies and Pacific) to coordinate initiatives for the region. Finally, the National Executive Committee {{is made up of}} the five CAC Regional Chairpersons {{as well as by the}} National Chairperson, who are responsible for liaison between the committees and the CSC HQ, monitor and <b>review</b> <b>all</b> policies or actions of the CSC at the local, regional and national levels and adopt cohesive strategy for all committees.|$|E

25|$|In 2009, a Hillsborough Independent Panel {{was formed}} to <b>review</b> <b>all</b> evidence. Reporting in 2012, it {{confirmed}} Taylor's 1990 criticisms, while also revealing new details {{about the extent of}} police efforts to shift blame onto fans, the role of other emergency services, and the error of the first coroner's inquest. The panel's report resulted in the previous findings of accidental death being quashed, and the creating of a new coroner's inquest. It also produced two criminal investigations led by police in 2012: Operation Resolve to look into the causes of the disaster, and by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) to examine actions by police in the aftermath.|$|E
25|$|In 2010 the University broke its {{links with}} a Malaysian college {{after it was}} {{discovered}} its director had bogus qualifications, while a Thai institution linked to the University {{was found to be}} operating illegally. In June 2011, a report from the Quality Assurance Agency found that the University had not run the necessary checks on institutes delivering courses it validated, and instructed it to <b>review</b> <b>all</b> of its validation arrangements. In October, the University announced that it would cease validating courses, just before news broke that one of its affiliated colleges in London was involved in a visa fraud. This led to calls from the vice chancellors of the universities of Aberystwyth, Bangor, Cardiff, Glamorgan and Swansea for the University of Wales to be wound up.|$|E
25|$|The {{clothing}} that the then-unidentified victim wore, Faded Glory, was traced to Walmart, its exclusive retailer. They were presumed {{to have been}} purchased in Naperville, at a Walmart store near where the body was found. The company assisted with the investigation, as it released for <b>review</b> <b>all</b> records of purchases of the items; only one sale could not be traced, {{as it was a}} cash purchase. The child's footprints were taken and compared to those from hospitals in the area, but did not match any of the records. By studying isotopes from his body, it was believed that he had lived in Illinois for most, if not all, of his short life. The analysis also indicated that his mother had lived {{in the northern part of}} the continent, where she spent most of her pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|Around 2000 in John Jay High School, Deidra DiMaso {{was troubled}} {{when she read}} Bless Me, Ultima to her two daughters. She was {{prompted}} to challenge the book’s placement in the high school's ninth grade curriculum. She addressed officials within the school and district alongside directly speaking in a school board meeting in November of that year. Her reasoning was that the book “is full of sex and cursing”; she later expanded on her policy by saying “I asked the board members to please <b>review</b> <b>all</b> the books for any sexual content, violence, or foul language prior to any book becoming required reading.”. The secondary source of this story, Banned in the U.S.A.: A Reference Guide to Book Censorship in Schools and Public Libraries, tells that the superintendent, Wayne Gersen, followed the standard protocol for addressing challenged materials but doesn’t specify {{the conclusion of the}} case.|$|E
25|$|It was {{discovered}} that the United Kingdom sold arms to Sri Lanka worth over £13.6 million {{in the last three}} years of the conflict, contravening the 1998 Code of Conduct on Arms Exports by the European Union that restricts business with countries facing internal conflicts or with poor human rights records and a history of violating international law. Several members of parliament expressed anger at the development. Four committees in the House of Commons expressed concern in a joint statement that arms made in the United Kingdom were fired on civilians during battles in Sri Lanka. In their annual report, the cross-party committees on arms export controls recommended the government should <b>review</b> <b>all</b> arms exports to Sri Lanka following the crackdown on rebels. The MPs also questioned the government's commitment to tackling corruption and bribery and called on ministers to investigate what British-supplied military equipment was used in the campaign against the Tamils.|$|E
25|$|The {{defeat of}} the 1791 Nepalese {{invasion}} increased the Qing's control over Tibet. From that moment, all important matters were to be submitted to the ambans. It strengthened {{the powers of the}} ambans. The ambans were elevated above the Kashag and the regents in responsibility for Tibetan political affairs. The Dalai and Panchen Lamas were no longer allowed to petition the Qing Emperor directly but could only do so through the ambans. The ambans took control of Tibetan frontier defense and foreign affairs. The ambans were put in command of the Qing garrison and the Tibetan army (whose strength was set at 3000 men). Trade was also restricted and travel could be undertaken only with documents issued by the ambans. The ambans were to <b>review</b> <b>all</b> judicial decisions. However, according to Warren Smith, these directives were either never fully implemented, or quickly discarded, as the Qing were more interested in a symbolic gesture of authority than actual sovereignty. In 1841, the Hindu Dogra dynasty attempted to establish their authority on Ü-Tsang but were defeated in the Sino-Sikh War (1841–1842).|$|E

25|$|Small Group Housing (SGH) is {{an option}} for juniors and seniors on Goshen's campus. Started in the 1970s, SGH offers {{students}} the opportunity to live in a house arrangement, with common kitchen and living spaces. The purpose of SGH is for students to develop another living experience alternative to dormitory life. This same idea was carried out with the construction of the Apartments. Goshen College maintains that SGH living is a privilege, and students must apply as a group to live in a residence. An application board consisting of resident directors, spiritual life, and physical plant <b>review</b> <b>all</b> potential candidates in the spring for the next school year. Each group must create a housing plan, division of responsibility, show examples of volunteerism, and a commitment to better the Goshen campus, as well as resolve conflict. Other factors considered in the application process include house cumulative GPA, extracurricular involvement, median age of the group, and personal faculty recommendations. Houses are then rewarded to applying groups who exemplify high academic, moral, and volunteer efforts, based on objective and subjective review.|$|E
25|$|After {{the battle}} and still {{by the end}} of the war, {{considerable}} controversy abounded over exactly what had happened at Jutland and who, if anyone, was to blame for perceived failings. With the war over, it was decided to publish an official history of the battle. Captain John Harper was appointed by the then First Sea Lord, Sir Rosslyn Wemyss, to <b>review</b> <b>all</b> the available documentation and write the report. At the moment Wemyss retired and was replaced as First Sea Lord by Beatty, the finished book had already reached the stage of proof copies awaiting approval on his desk. Beatty objected to the account, requesting Harper make alterations which Harper refused to do unless Beatty would give him written orders to that effect. It had already become known to the public that Harper was writing the account (questions had been asked about it in Parliament) and he refused to put his name to an account he could not agree with. Instead, Beatty appointed two brothers, Captains Alfred Dewar and Kenneth Dewar to write a 'staff appreciation' of the battle, which would be circulated to navy officers only. The Harper report was passed to Sir Julian Corbett, who was writing an official history of the whole naval war on behalf of the Committee of Imperial Defence. Corbett was shown the staff appreciation, and said I 'read it with increasing wonder till at last I felt it my duty to convey to the Admiralty that such a grotesque account of the battle certainly ought not to go out as their considered verdict'. The account was classified as 'secret' and yet another version was commissioned, the 'Admiralty Narrative'. This was shown to Jellicoe, and a long correspondence ensued where he objected to many parts of the narrative. With particular reference to Evan-Thomas, Jellicoe objected to the claim that Evan-Thomas had been responsible for the distance between his ships and Beatty's, which had resulted in Beatty going into battle without the support of the four most powerful ships in his command.|$|E
500|$|Some of the Senate Ethics Committee {{members were}} {{concerned}} that letting the senators off lightly would harm their own reputations. Nevertheless, the existing Senate rules did not specifically proscribe the actions taken by DeConcini, Riegle, Glenn, and McCain. Vice-chair Rudman defended the committee's actions, saying: [...] "Given the news media frenzy surrounding , the easiest thing for the committee to do {{would have been to}} find them guilty of something and recommend sanctions. ... The politically difficult thing, the one requiring backbone, was what we did — to <b>review</b> <b>all</b> the evidence and reach a predictably unpopular conclusion based only on fact." ...|$|E
