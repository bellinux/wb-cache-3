40|$|For {{production}} of proteins that are encoded by the mitochondrial genome, mitochondria {{rely on their}} own mitochondrial translation system, with the mitoribosome as its central component. Using extensive homology searches, we have reconstructed the evolutionary history of the mitoribosomal proteome that is encoded by a diverse subset of eukaryotic genomes, revealing an ancestral ribosome of alpha-proteobacterial descent that more than doubled its protein content in most eukaryotic lineages. We observe large variations in the protein content of mitoribosomes between different eukaryotes, with mammalian mitoribosomes sharing only 74 and 43 % of its proteins with yeast and Leishmania mitoribosomes, respectively. We detected many previously unidentified mitochondrial ribosomal proteins (MRPs) and found that several have increased in size compared to their bacterial ancestral counterparts by addition of functional domains. Several new MRPs have originated via duplication of existing MRPs {{as well as by}} <b>recruitment</b> <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> of the mitoribosomal proteome. Using sensitive profile-profile homology searches, we found hitherto undetected homology between bacterial and eukaryotic ribosomal proteins, as well as between fungal and mammalian ribosomal proteins, detecting two novel human MRPs.

40|$|Worldwide decline {{has been}} {{observed}} in coral populations due to environmental changes at both regional and global levels. Since corals have a typical metapopulation structure, the recovery of severely disturbed local populations depends on larval <b>recruitment</b> <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> the disturbed region. Therefore, the connectivity among local populations may {{play a key role}} in the disturbance/ recovery dynamics of coral populations. On the basis of the simulation of surface currents, derived from ocean currents, we hypothesized that the genetic connectivity of coral populations is weak between the northern and southern regions of Sekisei Reef, Japan. To test this hypothesis, the connectivity of the population of the broadcast-spawning coral Acropora digitifera, one of the dominant corals in the Sekisei Reef, was analyzed at six sampling sites that were 5 – 25 km apart by using six microsatellite markers. The degree of genetic differentiation of A. digitifera was very low among all the sites (FST from - 0. 006 to 0. 015), and no evidence was found in support of our hypothesis. The relative lack of genetic differentiation of A. digitifera among the sites may be attributable to the large effect of wind-driven surface currents, which highly vary on an annual basis, on coral larvae or to the time gap between simulation based on ocean current patterns and accumulation of genetic differences. Considering the pattern of the genetic connectivity of A. digitifera in the Sekisei Reef, the sites that are located within less-disturbed areas may act as larval sources and should, therefore, be preserved...|$|E
40|$|The {{health of}} the rural {{population}} in Western Australia (WA) is predicated on equity and access to healthcare facilities with nurses being {{the main component of}} front line staff. There continues to be a nurse shortage particularly in remote regions of Australia where the poor health status of Australian Indigenous people, and an increasing ageing population are a perennial problem. The Kimberley, the setting for this study, is a remote region in the north of WA. It has a landmass of 423, 517 square kilometres with a significantly low-density population compared to the total WA population. Nearly half of the Kimberley population is comprised of Indigenous peoples. Broome is the largest town in the Kimberley with a population of 14, 997 and is the location of the University of Notre Dame Australia, Broome Campus School of Nursing and Midwifery. Strategies to encourage nurses to work in the region are crucial to the {{health of the}} local population. <b>Recruitment</b> <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> the area provides short-term relief, but providing nursing education within this remote region may well provide a more self-sufficient, sustainable workforce. This study explored and described the factors that influenced remote school of nursing graduates from the University in their decision to work in a Kimberley hospital. A single, exploratory, descriptive case study was chosen to underpin the framework of this study with decision-making theory providing a theoretical perspective. This approach enabled an in-depth exploration of the phenomenon and the context. In keeping with the principles of a case study approach to qualitative methodology, there were several sources of data collected from graduates, workforce nurses, nurse managers, documents and a promotional DVD. Collection of data and analysis was a continuous iterative process with themes and patterns emerging until the point of saturation was established. The findings of this study revealed multiple, complex and interrelated influencing factors. Three major themes emerged from the analysis of data: Local exposure, personal factors and professional factors. These influences were further delineated into enabling, or inhibiting influences but it was local exposure that underpinned all factors. It was the balancing of these opposing issues that ultimately led to the graduate’s final decision...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of dispersal in regulating patterns of gene flow, there are still major gaps in {{our knowledge of the}} consequences of many dispersal strategies for the genetic structure of marine populations. Until recently, most of our knowledge was based on studies which had investigated sexually reproducing species with the potential for wide dispersal of planktonic larvae. Relatively few studies have concentrated on intertidal species which lack a clear means of dispersal. This study used ecological and genetic techniques to investigate the consequences of restricted dispersal for marine intertidal populations, and to provide an important comparison for two closely related co-occurring intertidal species with contrasting life histories. Importantly, this study also provides the first investigation of the genetic consequences of wide dispersal for an intertidal species over such a large area of the eastern Australian coastline. Additionally {{this is one of the}} first investigations of the consequences of restricted dispersal on natural populations along the east coast of Australia. The co-occurring intertidal starfish, Patiriella calcar and P. exigua occur along much of the southeastern coastline of Australia. Whilst the breeding system is far from fully described for either species, P. calcar is believed to have the potential for wide dispersal via a sexually produced planktonic larvae. In contrast, P. exigua lacks a dispersive phase, as juveniles develop directly on the rocky shore and are thought to remain within the parental habitat. P. exigua 2 ̆ 7 s breeding system is further complicated as it is a simultaneous and/or protandric hermaphrodite. Although the life history of P. calcar includes planktonic larvae, the broad geographic range over which sampling was conducted in this study (1, 800 km) provided the potential for genetic differentiation, as a consequence of linear dispersal along the coastline, and the complexity and unpredictability of the East Australian Current. Despite the potential for disjunct genetic patterns among local populations of P. calcar, there was remarkably little genetic differentiation among local populations of P. calcar (FST = 0. 008 ± 0. 001). Such homogeneity was indicative of strong gene flow over the 1, 800 km of this study, and it was estimated that approximately 31 genetically effective migrants are exchanged between populations each generation. Electrophoretic data also indicated that local populations of P. calcar are maintained by recruitment of outcrossed sexually produced offspring. Single-locus genotype frequencies at the five enzyme-encoding loci assayed in 26 local populations, closely matched expectations for Hardy-Weinberg equilibria. Like P. calcar, local populations of P. eXlgua are maintained by outcrossed sexual reproduction. Single-locus genotype frequencies of six enzyme-encoding loci within all 25 local populations of P. exigua were in close agreement with expectations for Hardy-Weinberg equilibria. In contrast, to the broad panmixis of P. calcar and as expected for a species lacking a dispersive phase, large genetic differences were found among populations of P. exigua some separated by as little as 5 km. Such genetic differentiation among populations resulted in an extremely high FST value of 0. 518 ± 0. 054 among 25 local populations over 1, 1 00 kn 1 of the southeast Australian coastline. A significant positive correlation existed between geographic and genetic distance and was indicative of isolation by distance such as that predicted by a stepping stone model, implying that local populations may be at, or near, equilibrium under their current regime of dispersal. For P. exigua, the absence of gametic phase disequilibrium and the uniformity of genetic diversity among local populations further suggests that these may be well established local populations which have not recently been subject to population bottlenecks or recent colonisation. Effectively closed populations such as those of P. exigua should be particularly susceptible to the effects of stochastic processes, variability in demographic parameters and changes in localised site-specific selection. However, the consistent pattern of polymorphism for alleles at the Mdh locus in a group of four local populations along the Victorian coastline, that are virtually fixed for alternate alleles in populations to the north and south, suggests that sporadic migration of individuals via rafting may have occurred among the northern and southern groups. Clearly, such stability results from the lack of genetic input from outside sources and the apparently large size of P. exigua local populations. However, localised site-specific selection for heterozygosity was put forward as a possible hypothesis to explain the unusual patterns of allelic variation at the normally monomorphic Mdh locus in four neighbouring populations on the Victorian coast. A set of breeding experiments were used to confirm the assumption of normal Mendelian inheritance at the Mdh and Gpi loci, as such an assumption is central to population genetic studies, especially in view of the unusual allelic patterns of variation at the Mdh locus. In contrast to the extreme genetic differentiation exhibited among populations of P. exiuga is evidence that local populations are randomly mating, panmictic units (sensu Wright 1943) (Fsp values ranged from 0 to 0. 020 within four local populations). Although individuals of P. exigua were not evenly distributed across the rocky shore, these aggregations were not family breeding groups, as all individuals were inferred to be the product of outcrossed sexual reproduction. The scale and extent of differentiation within populations will reflect the breeding system of the organism, the distance and frequency of migration within local populations and the frequency of <b>recruitment</b> <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> sources. These data imply that these four populations are apparently large, well established local populations which rarely receive successful immigration from outside sources, and that adults and juveniles freely mix and mate at random. A consequence of the seemingly large size of local populations, is that genetic drift is unlikely to be important unless Ne fluctuates significantly. The contrasting life histories of P. calcar and P. exigua, resulted in vastly different patterns of genetic differentiation. Despite the potential barriers to dispersal of P. calcar, high levels of gene flow occurred among long populations along the east coast of Australia. As expected for a species with severely restricted dispersal, there was little gene flow among P. exigua populations. However, unlike the typical situation expected for species with severely restricted dispersal, local populations of P. exigua are large panmictic breeding groups in which apparently highly mobile adults and juveniles provide for gene flow. Consequently, these populations may be somewhat buffered against the effects of drift through fluctuations in population size...|$|E
40|$|Current {{thoughts}} about the integration of field and laboratory sciences in genetic control of disease vectors Thomas W. Scott? Realizing the full potential of genetic control of vectors for disease prevention will require development of a research agenda that captures the willingness of people with diverse expertise to work together toward constructive and substantive goals. Below I review the five ecological and population biology topics that are central to contemporary genetic vector-control programmes and present opportunities of collaboration between people engaged in primarily laboratory- versus field-based research activities: (1) spread and stability of introduced genes; (2) evolutionary consequences of mosquito transformation; (3) entomological risk, pathogen transmission and disease severity; (4) quantitative analyses of mosquito biology, disease and genetically modified mosquito (GMM) control; and (5) procedural issues. I point out opportunities for greater, mutually beneficial interaction between laboratory- and field-based scientists. I draw four general conclusions from this analysis. First, an improved understanding of ecological topics associated with GMMs will provide the conceptual and factual foundation for application of genetic-control technology. Second, four topics {{that should be considered}} research priorities are male biology, mating behaviour, colonization and mass-production effects, and population biology. Third, in addition to greater collaboration between ecologists and molecular geneticists, genetic-control programmes will require <b>recruitment</b> of expertise <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> the vector-borne disease arena, greater involvement by scientists from disease-endemic countries (DECs), training for young scientists, adequate funding, and a sustained effort. Fourth, collaboration will be a central component of the legacy and success of genetic control for vector-borne disease prevention...|$|R

40|$|Moreton Bay, located 27 °S on {{the east}} coast of Australia, {{provides}} a rare instance of urban, subtropical, marginal coral reefs in an urbanised environment, adjacent to a major city 500 km south of the Great Barrier Reef. These reefs have been regarded as being close to environmental extinction, yet substantial living coral assemblages remain, and are currently at their highest recorded living diversity in this location. We taxonomically review collections of living and fossil coral specimens made over an 83 -year period (1924 – 2007) from this bay. Our study records 64 scleractinian species from 26 genera and 13 families living in Inner Moreton Bay during the period 2003 – 2007, including 59 reef-building and five solitary species. This includes species newly recruiting into the bay, although our study also reveals the presence of previously unrecorded species in earlier collections. More diverse coral assemblages at this latitude occur in the oceanic waters of Outer Moreton Bay at Flinders Reef and other small reefs, where 125 species from 35 genera are recorded. In total, 143 species from 40 genera are recorded in the Moreton Bay region. The corals of Inner Moreton Bay show a remarkable persistence through time (78 % are also recorded in the Holocene fossil record) and space (72 % occur in Outer Moreton Bay and 59 % to the south in New South Wales), which indicates an inbuilt resilience within regional subtropical assemblages. We suggest that this persistence {{is the result of a}} naturally dynamic system, in which intermittent loss of species due to severe natural impacts such as episodic freshwater flooding is mitigated by <b>recruitment</b> <b>from</b> sources <b>outside</b> the bay. We further suggest it is possible for additional regional species to establish themselves in the bay, as changes in the environmental management regime begin to reverse the effects of anthropogenic disturbances such as coral mining, over-fishing, and runoff of nutrients and pollutants. Other factors that may have led to the present high level of species richness could include: the passage of several years of severe drought without major flooding; warmer climatic conditions; or a combination of some or all of these conditions. We present systematic descriptions of all taxa from Inner Moreton Bay, using morphological features specific to Moreton Bay representatives, and also the general distribution and southerly limit for each species, as a baseline for observation of future change.  Marginal coral reefs, resilience, climate change, biogeography, taxonomy, Moreton Bay, Queensland, Cnidaria, Anthozoa, Hexacorallia, Scleractinia...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} experiences and perceptions of senior executives and managers who have made one or more transitions between the public, private, academic and third sectors in the UK. The personal experience of inter-sector transition is an under-researched phenomenon, particularly in the UK. This interpretative qualitative study aims to enhance understanding of inter-sector transition and to identify the challenges and enablers of a successful transition. The context for this research is the increased blurring between the organisational sectors, as {{many parts of the}} public sector decline in size, the role of the private and third sectors in service delivery become more significant, and hybrid partnerships increase. The influence of New Public Management, which has introduced private sector practices into the public, academic and third sectors is also a factor in potentially reducing the difference between the sectors. In the researcher’s work environment, <b>recruitment</b> of personnel <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> the academic sector is increasing. The professional implications for the study are to understand the factors which enable a smooth and successful transition, in order that individuals achieve job satisfaction and that the organisation benefits from their productivity as soon as possible. The study adopts a qualitative methodology, drawing on grounded theory methods for the collection and analysis of data. Fifteen managers and senior executives from a range of professions and sectors participated in in-depth interviews. The findings suggest that enablers of a successful transition are familiarity with the destination sector prior to transitioning, work values which align with those of the destination organisation, appropriate professional skills, and mentoring support. The main challenges to a successful transition are organisational cultures, the questioning of professional identity and issues of self-esteem. In addition to enhancing the understanding of transition enablers and challenges, the contribution to professional practice is demonstrated through practical guidelines for line managers, which will assist with inductions of new starters <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> the sector. The key limitations of the research are identified as being the size and characteristics of the sample, together with the lack of triangulation from participants’ managers or reports concerning the success of the transition. Recommendations for future research are to broaden the sample so that particular characteristics may be explored in more detail, such as age, gender and professional background. There is also scope for further research into the leadership characteristics which lend themselves to successful inter-sector transitions...|$|R
