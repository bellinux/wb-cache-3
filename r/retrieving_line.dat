50|$|The {{two most}} common types of cutting are done with {{abrasive}} coated line - release cutting or pull cutting. To release cut, once {{the lines are}} in contact, both parties start to play out line until one line is cut. In pull cutting, the flier quickly <b>retrieves</b> <b>line</b> until the opponents line is cut. There are many factors in who will win the event and include {{the size of the}} kite, the quality of the kite, the quality of the line, the quality of the abrasive on the line, the quality and size of the spool, the spool handler, initial contact, the skill of the person flying the kite, and the wind conditions.|$|R

The centrepin reel uses a large diameter spool typically mounted to a 12-17 foot surfcasting rod. A bracket attached to the reel that allows it to be rotated 90° to the rod for casting and returned to a position to <b>retrieve</b> <b>line.</b> In the casting position the spool is perpendicular to the rod, opening the face of the reel allowing the line to run {{off the side of the}} spool when released in the cast.|$|R

2500|$|Fly reels are {{normally}} manual, single-action designs. Rotating {{a handle on}} the side of the reel rotates the spool which <b>retrieves</b> the <b>line,</b> usually at a 1:1 ratio (i.e., one complete revolution of the handle equals one revolution of the spool). [...] Fly reels are one of the simplest reels and have far fewer parts than a spinning reel. [...] The larger the fish the more important the reel becomes. [...] On the outside of the reel there are two levels of knobs these are the spool release and the drag adjustment.|$|R

Fourier transform absorption spectra of the 2 - 0 band of 12 C 16 O mixed with CO 2 have been recorded at total pressures from 156 to 1212 hPa and at 4 different temperatures between 240 K and 283 K. CO 2 pressure-induced line broadening and line shift coefficients, and the associated temperature dependence have been measured in an multi-spectrum non-linear least squares analysis using Voigt profiles with an asymmetric profile due to line mixing. The measured CO 2 -broadening and CO 2 -shift parameters were compared with theoretical values, calculated by collaborators. In addition, the CO 2 -broadening and shift coefficients have been calculated for individual temperatures using the Exponential Power Gap (EPG) semi-empirical method.
