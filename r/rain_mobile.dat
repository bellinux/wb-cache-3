50|$|Talod has {{recently}} seen some high development, {{including a new}} building to head the Talod government. Some roads in Talod (espeacially northern Talod) have been paved. Many services are available in Talod, but running water is only available from 7 am-8 pm and 6-7 for all households in the central and southern district. Power outages are frequent from April to October, because of the <b>rain.</b> <b>Mobile</b> service is excellent on all of main Indian mobile networks. Talod {{has a variety of}} shops, and shows more progressing over the years. Talod also has its own police force, ambulance service, and emergency call center.|$|E
50|$|A {{week after}} its launch in Taiwan and Hong Kong, Animax {{launched}} in Southeast Asia on 19 January 2004, initially featuring its anime programming {{exclusively in the}} original Japanese audio with English subtitling, becoming the company's first English language network. It also later incorporated an English audio dub feed. On 31 August 2006, Animax launched in Malaysia, in the Southeast Asian English language feed and also in Japanese audio feed with subtitles in the local languages. Prior to this, selected Animax shows were shown on astro@15 (formerly channel 15, now channel 715), an interactive channel, starting 15 December 2004, from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m., later shortened to 2 hours (until 9 a.m.). Anime such as Chobits, Cardcaptor Sakura, Great Teacher Onizuka, Ultra Maniac, Haibane Renmei, Doctor Dokkiri, Vision of Escaflowne, Midori no Hibi, Captain Tsubasa, Wolf's <b>Rain,</b> <b>Mobile</b> Suit Gundam, Cowboy Bebop, Ghost in the Shell: S.A.C. {{were some of the}} network' early airing in Southeast Asia. It has also aired several series, including Fate/stay night, Blood+, Honey and Clover, Maria-sama ga Miteru, Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo, Otogizōshi, Jigoku Shōjo, Galaxy Angel, Witch Hunter Robin, Samurai 7, Gunslinger Girl, Urusei Yatsura, Ranma 1/2, and Detective Conan.|$|E
40|$|This study, {{carried out}} under field conditions, {{assessed}} {{the extent to}} which temporary breakdown of mlo-resistance, following relief of water-stress, was determined by genetic background and mlo allele. Commercial barley cultivars expressing the mlo gene for resistance to powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis (Blumeria graminis) f. sp. hordei) were tested as well as doubled haploid progeny from spring barley genotypes, a proportion of which were sown in the field in two successive years. Plants were protected from natural <b>rain</b> by a <b>mobile</b> <b>rain</b> shelter and either watered by trickle-irrigation or allowed to dry. Percentage mildew infection resulting from natural inoculum was recorded and the doubled haploid genotypes were classified as resistant, intermediate or susceptible {{on the basis of their}} control (watered) treatment scores. In each of the three designated classes, particular genotypes developed infection levels, following relief of water-stress, that were higher than those observed on the well-watered controls. This was found not to be related to the mlo allele as there was no significant difference between the increases observed on resistant plants carrying mlo 9 and resistant plants carrying mlo 11. Differences in the degree of breakdown of resistance were attributed to genetic background rather than to the specific mlo allele...|$|R
5000|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{extended into}} northern Georgia. In Heard County, {{the city of}} Franklin recorded 6.13 in of precipitation. Portions of State Route 34 were inundated with up to 2 ft of water. To the east in Coweta County, 6 to 8 in of <b>rain</b> fell. Two <b>mobile</b> home parks were flooded. Water also inundated Interstate 85 at exit 11. In Spalding County, 14.30 in of precipitation was observed at Griffin. Many homes and businesses were flooded and several earthen dams failed. A woman died when her cars ran into a washed out road; two others were injured in the same location.|$|R
40|$|A large yield gap {{exists in}} rain-fed maize (Zea mays L.) {{production}} in semi-arid regions, {{mainly caused by}} frequent droughts halfway through the crop-growing period due to uneven distribution of rainfall. It is questionable whether irrigation systems are economically required in such a region since {{the total amount of}} rainfall does generally meet crop requirements. This study aimed to quantitatively determine the effects of water stress from jointing to grain filling on root and shoot growth and the consequences for maize grain yield, above- and below-ground dry matter, water uptake (WU) and water use efficiency (WUE). Pot experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 with a <b>mobile</b> <b>rain</b> shelter to achieve conditions of no, mild or severe water stress. Maize yield was not affected by mild water stress over 2 years, while severe stress reduced yield by 56...|$|R
40|$|Past {{studies on}} the railway {{satellite}} channel (RSC) at Ku band and above consider exclusively the attenuation coming from the metal power arches (PAs) along the railway route, producing significant though deterministic periodical fast fading. Nevertheless, limited {{attention has been given}} to model tropospheric effects on the RSC. The present paper takes a more comprehensive view of the RSC by introducing a novel stochastic dynamic model of <b>rain</b> fading in <b>mobile</b> satellite systems on top of the diffraction because of PAs. The proposed approach builds upon well-established research on rain attenuation time series synthesizers employing stochastic differential equations. It is shown that this propagation tool may provide significant aid, in general, in mobile satellite system simulations and in the design of fade mitigation techniques (FMTs), particularly aiming at the railway scenario. The tool enables the generation of fade events, fade duration statistics, rain attenuation power spectrum and predicting the necessary FMT control loop margin. This is particularly useful for the RSC because most of the proposed FMTs focusing on PAs are not appropriate for compensating atmospheric fading. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{experiment on}} {{the responses of}} maize (Zea mays L.) from the third leaf stage to maturity for different soil water levels (well-watered, moderately stressed, and severely stressed) was conducted by controlling irrigation and using a <b>mobile</b> <b>rain</b> shelter in a neutral loam, meadow soil {{to determine the effects}} on leaf water status, membrane permeability and enzymatic antioxidant system for different growth stages. The results indicated that drought stress relied on drought intensity and duration, with more severe drought stress creating more serious effects on maize. Compared with well-watered conditions, during the silking and blister stages moderate stress did not significantly change the relative water content (RWC) and did change significantly the relative conductivity (RC) (P < 0. 05) of the leaves; however, severe stress did significantly decrease (P < 0. 01) the leaf RWC and increase (P < 0. 01) membrane permeability (leaf relative conductivity). Furthermore, under severe drought stress antioxidant enzyme activities declined significantly (P < 0. 01) in later stages, namely for superoxide dismutase (SOD) the tasseling and blister stages, for peroxidase (POD) the milk stage, and for catalase (CAT) during the tasseling, blister, and milk stages. Meanwhile, membrane lipid peroxidation (measured as malondialdehyde content) significantly increased (P < 0. 01) in all stages. Key Words: drought stress, enzymatic antioxidant system, leaf water status, maize, membrane permeabilit...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the drought tolerance of new wheat genotypes to terminal water stress in field conditions, an experiment using a {{split plot design}} based on compelet randomaised block design with three replications was conducted in Torogh Agricultural Research Station (Mashad) in 1382 - 83. Irrigation treatments with two levels were allocated in main plots: I 1 - full irrigation (100 % water use in different development stages) and I 2 - water stress (withdrawal of irrigation from anthesis stage to maturity with prevention of precipitation using <b>mobile</b> <b>rain</b> shelter). Number of 16 elite wheat genotypes suited for cold regions of Iran and Khorasan province (C- 82) were allocated in sub plots. Results showed that, irrigation treatment {{had a significant effect}} on grain yield (GY), harvest index (HI), No. of spike per m 2 (S. m- 2), No. of grain per spike (G. S- 1) and thousands kernel weight (1000 KW). There was significant differences between genotypes. C- 82 - 5 was a high yielding genotype in both conditions (control and water stress) and had optimum level of HI, G. S- 1 and 1000 KW. The tolerance of genotypes to water stress was evalovated with different drought tolerance indices, such as stress tolerance index (STI). Results showed that, C- 82 - 5 was a high yielding genotype with more tolerance to terminal water stress...|$|R
