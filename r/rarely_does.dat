5|$|Twenty years later, Jane, now a {{successful}} author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom during a gathering. Henry, now married to Eliza, brings Tom to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter, who admires Jane's novels. Tom's daughter asks Jane to read aloud, but as Jane <b>rarely</b> <b>does</b> so he remonstrates {{with his daughter}} using her name, which is also Jane. Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to read. The last scene shows Tom's daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from Pride and Prejudice, while Tom watches Jane affectionately. As she concludes, their eyes meet, and Tom joins {{the rest of the}} company in honouring Jane and her work with applause.|$|E

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, his website Bitter Films annually auctioned off artwork instead to raise {{thousands of dollars for}} local Santa Barbara charities. Other original drawings have been occasionally given away through the Bitter Films online store through special promotions. Because Hertzfeldt also <b>rarely</b> <b>does</b> signings, his artwork is rare for animation collectors and fans to own.|$|E

25|$|Despite these facts, {{studies show}} {{only a slight}} {{increase}} in immediate stressors among military brats whose parents serve in a combat zone, although no studies on the longer-term effects have ever been done. Boys and younger children do show the most risk when a parent is deployed, but <b>rarely</b> <b>does</b> this require clinical intervention. However, studies show that when a military member is deployed to a combat zone, the family cohesion is more disrupted than when service members are deployed to non-combat zones.|$|E
25|$|Presidential {{candidates}} and parliamentary candidates {{must be approved}} by the Guardian Council (all members of which are directly or indirectly elected by the Leader) or the Leader before running, in order to ensure their allegiance to the Supreme Leader. The Leader very <b>rarely</b> <b>does</b> the vetting himself directly, but has the power to do so, in which case additional approval of the Guardian Council would not be needed. The Leader can also revert the decisions of the Guardian Council. The Guardian Council can, and has dismissed some elected members of the Iranian parliament in the past. For example, Minoo Khaleghi was disqualified by Guardian Council even after winning election, as she had been photographed in a meeting without wearing headscarf.|$|E
25|$|Shamrock Rovers and Bohemians in the Republic, Glentoran and Linfield in Northern Ireland, and Derry City, a {{team from}} the North who play in the League of Ireland. Due to the {{financial}} incentives abroad, most of Ireland's top players, such as Damien Duff, John O'Shea, Aiden McGeady and Jonny Evans, play in the leagues of larger European countries, particularly in England and Scotland. This, along with the Irish media's huge coverage of the English league, {{is one of the}} reasons why Irish people tend to support leading British clubs such as Manchester United, Liverpool, Celtic and Rangers. <b>Rarely</b> <b>does</b> a League of Ireland or Irish League player make either of the national teams, despite the fact that the leagues sometimes produce some of Ireland's top players including current internationals Kevin Doyle, Shane Long and Gareth McAuley and players like Roy Keane in the past.|$|E

500|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{agree that}} Jesus was a Jew of 1st century Palestine. Ioudaios in New Testament Greek {{is a term}} which in the contemporary context may refer to religion (Second Temple Judaism), ethnicity (of Judea), or both. In {{a review of the}} state of modern scholarship, Amy-Jill Levine writes that the entire question of ethnicity is [...] "fraught with difficulty", and that [...] "beyond recognizing that 'Jesus was Jewish', <b>rarely</b> <b>does</b> the scholarship address what being 'Jewish' means".|$|E
500|$|SMAW {{is often}} used to weld carbon steel, low and high alloy steel, {{stainless}} steel, cast iron, and ductile iron. While less popular for nonferrous materials, it can be used on nickel and copper and their alloys and, in rare cases, on aluminium. The thickness of the material being welded is bounded on the low end primarily by the skill of the welder, but <b>rarely</b> <b>does</b> it drop below [...] No upper bound exists: with proper joint preparation and use of multiple passes, materials of virtually unlimited thicknesses can be joined. Furthermore, depending on the electrode used and the skill of the welder, SMAW can be used in any position.|$|E
500|$|Hepatitis B is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) that affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and <b>rarely</b> <b>does</b> the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected {{around the time of}} birth 90% develop chronic [...] while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease.|$|E

500|$|Barfi!s soundtrack {{received}} positive reviews by critics. Hindustan Times {{rated the}} album 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "verall, the soundtrack is a joyride sans flaws. Pritam has given many hits, but like his tunes in Life in a... Metro, {{this one will}} be remembered for breaking the monotony in his sound. There are no foot-tapping numbers or remixes here, but the simplicity that makes this album a winner." [...] Koimoi gave the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and stated, [...] "In simple words, Barfi! is excellent music on all counts. Very <b>rarely</b> <b>does</b> one get to hear an album where you can hear a complete soundtrack without skipping tracks; this is one of them. So, just play, enjoy the music and the world of Barfi!". Joginder Tuteja of Bollywood Hungama rated the album 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated [...] "Barfi!s soundtrack is quite good and is easily one of the best quality creations by Pritam. He has totally reinvented himself with this album which defies Bollywood norms and boasts of a sound of its own." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} with the stark view of Winesburg, Ohio above, a number of scholars have taken the perspective that the cycle is, in fact, about escape from isolation instead of the condition itself. Barry D. Bort writes, [...] "Criticism of Winesburg, Ohio has recognized this desperate need to communicate, but what has not been understood about Anderson's work is that this continual frustration serves as the context out of which arise a few luminous moments of understanding...Such moments {{are at the heart}} of Winesburg, Ohio, although they are few and evanescent". Though <b>rarely</b> <b>does</b> escape come in the narrative present, many of the stories prominently feature anecdotes of past adventures where lonely and reserved characters run naked through the town on a rainy night (Alice Hindman in [...] "Adventure"), drive their wagon headlong into a speeding locomotive (Windpeter Winters in [...] "The Untold Lie"), and have window-shattering religious epiphanies (Reverend Curtis Hartman in [...] "The Strength of God"). While not all of the adventures are so dramatic, each has its place in the annals of the town, sometimes as told to George Willard, other times in the memories of participants.|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on {{the film}} a decade after it came out, critic Danny Peary said he found Duvall's {{restrained}} portrayal [...] "extremely irritating" [...] and criticized the entire cast, save for Buckley, for their [...] "subdued, emotions-in-check, phony 'honest' performances. You just wish the whole lot of them would start tickling each other." [...] In his book Alternate Oscars, listing his personal opinions of who should have won the Academy Awards each year, Peary excluded Tender Mercies from all the categories, and chose Michael Caine as deserving of the Best Actor honor for Educating Rita. In June 2009, critic Roger Ebert included Tender Mercies in The Great Movies, his series of reviews celebrating what he considers the most important films of all time. He praised what he called one of Duvall's most understated performances, as well as Foote's minimalist storytelling and the restraint and patience of Beresford's direction. Ebert said of Foote's screenplay, [...] "The down-to-earth quality of his characters drew attention away from his minimalist storytelling; all the frills were stripped away.... <b>Rarely</b> <b>does</b> a movie elaborate less and explain more than Tender Mercies." ...|$|E

500|$|Wilson McBee of Slant Magazine {{was more}} {{negative}} towards the album, writing that [...] "Let the Blind Lead presents an intriguing mixture of sounds, but <b>rarely</b> <b>does</b> Cox whip them into anything very exciting." [...] In his review, he likened the album to a [...] "tempered" [...] version of Deerhunter's Cryptograms. [...] Under the Radar magazine wrote {{that many of}} the tracks of Let the Blind Lead [...] "never materialize into anything more substantial than vapor." [...] Sean O'Neal of The Onion's The A.V. Club said that, considering the number of free songs Cox has released on his blog, a full-length album [...] "seems almost beside the point." [...] He wrote that the record's songs suggest the work of [...] "a bedroom-pop auteur who doesn't know when to quit tweaking". [...] Allmusic writer Marisa Brown found that, with Let the Blind Lead, [...] "as with Deerhunter, Cox has the tendency to try too hard to be profound (take the title -- or the title track -- for example), wanting so badly to say something important that he sounds trite and forced, and untrustworthy." [...] Jonathen Cohen wrote in his review for Magnet that [...] "Coxâs narratives make little sense", noting [...] "much of the time, heâs not even singing so much as wailing wordlessly".|$|E
500|$|Ty Burr of the Boston Globe {{gave the}} film a perfect four star rating, {{describing}} it as [...] "ridiculously satisfying", and the [...] "best prequel ever". Burr praised the character {{development in the}} film, opining that [...] "emotionally, Star Trek hits every one of its marks, functioning as a family reunion that extends across decades, entertainment mediums, even blurring the line between audience and show." [...] He continued: [...] "Trading on affections sustained over 40 years of popular culture, Star Trek does what a franchise reboot <b>rarely</b> <b>does.</b> It reminds us why we loved these characters in the first place." [...] Owen Gleiberman from Entertainment Weekly gave the film an 'A-' grade, commenting that director Abrams [...] "crafts an origin story that avoids any hint of the origin doldrums." [...] Similar sentiments were expressed by Rolling Stone journalist Peter Travers, who gave the film a 3.5 out of 4 stars. He felt that the acting from the cast was {{the highlight of the}} filming, asserting that the performance of Pine radiated star quality. Likewise, Travers called Quinto's performance [...] "sharp" [...] and [...] "intuitive", and felt that Quinto [...] "gave the film a soul". Manohla Dargis of the New York Times wrote, [...] "Star Trek [...] isnât just a pleasurable rethink of your geek uncle's favorite science-fiction series. It's also a testament to television's power as mythmaker, as a source for some of the fundamental stories we tell about ourselves, who we are and where we came from. Slate Dana Stevens felt that the film was [...] "a gift {{to those of us who}} loved the original series, that brainy, wonky, idealistic body of work that aired to almost no commercial success between 1966â69 and has since become a science fiction archetype and object of cult adoration." [...] Time Out London Tom Huddleston praised the aesthetic qualities of the film, such as the design of Enterprise, and praised the performances of the cast. He wrote, [...] "The cast are equally strong: Quinto brings wry charm to an otherwise calculating character, while Pine powers through his performance in bullish, if not quite Shatner-esque fashion." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} a generally positive response from film critics, being commended on {{the subtlety of}} its humor {{as well as being}} named as [...] "the funniest" [...] or [...] "one of the funniest" [...] films of the year by several critics. As of June 3, 2017, the aggregate review website Rotten Tomatoes registered an 84% positive response based on reviews from 146 critics and certified the film [...] "Fresh" [...] with an average rating of 6.9/10. As of the same date, Metacritic, another aggregate review website, registered a rating of 73 out of 100, based on 33 reviews, which is classified as [...] "Generally favorable reviews" [...] by the website's rating system. Kenneth Turan, film critic for Los Angeles Times, called it [...] "the funniest film of the year so far, possibly the most amusing mainstream live-action comedy since There's Something About Mary." [...] Critic Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal stated that the film [...] "does almost everything right with a story about everything going wrong" [...] and that it [...] "works up a major comic delirium on the theme of Murphy's Law", concluding that [...] "Meet the Parents is the funniest movie of the year." [...] CNN's Paul Clinton proclaimed [...] "Meet the Parents {{is one of the best}} comedies of this â or any other â year", calling it [...] "wonderfully funny" [...] and expressing his hope that [...] "the Academy will also recognize this wonderful movie, something it <b>rarely</b> <b>does</b> when it comes to comedies" [...] Time magazine's film critic Richard Schickel stated that the film was [...] "divinely invented and perfectly orchestrated". He complimented the screenplay by calling the screenwriters Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg [...] "a couple of skilled tool-and-die makers" [...] as well as the acting cast because he believed that they [...] "understand that palpable reality will always trump frenzied fantasy when it comes to getting laughs." [...] Schickel concluded his review by proclaiming Meet the Parents a [...] "superbly antic movie". Todd McCarthy of Variety magazine called the film [...] "flat-out hilarious" [...] and Neil Smith of BBC proclaimed that [...] "there's not a weak scene in this super-funny picture" [...] while awarding it a rating of five stars out of five. Film critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three stars out of four comparing the film to Roach's previous work on the Austin Powers film series and offering his opinion that [...] " [...] is funnier because it never tries too hard." [...] Critic Christopher Null of AMC's Filmcritic.com claimed that [...] "Meet the Parents is one of the funniest comedies I've seen since Annie Hall". Lisa Schwarzbaum from Entertainment Weekly called the script [...] "unforced" [...] and concluded that the film [...] "goes down like a flute of Champagne, leaving an aftertaste of giggles." ...|$|E
