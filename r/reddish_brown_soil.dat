Soil types have been classified as zonal types comprising red-brown earths (dominant type in the park with low permeability), grey duplex soils in flat areas (with high permeability) and uniform medium loams (on steep slopes on the southern direction of shallow depth and well drained); azonal soil types consisting of alluvial soils (fertile soils in the park consisting of clay loams to gravels suitable to grow tolerant plant species like river red gum and river bottle-brush), colluvial soils (at the toe of steep slopes of dark grey to dark brown in colour, suitable to grow wide variety of vegetation) and lithosols (<b>reddish</b> <b>brown</b> <b>soils</b> on steep slopes and frequently support boxthorn and indigenous lightwoods (Acacia implexa); and other lithosols which are pre-basaltic sands and gravels seen near the foot of Grey Box Gully and in lower slopes of the Jacksons Creek valley.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the Quaternary {{geologic}} {{history of the}} Ryukyu Islands has been made clear {{on the grounds of}} the field data of regional stratigraphy and also the results of the geochronology by ^ C measurements. The Quaternary System in the Ryukyu Islands is divided in ascending order into the Upper Shinzato Formation and Chinen Sandstone Member of the Shimajiri Group, Ryukyu Limestone and Terrace Deposits of the Ryukyu Group in the Pleistocene, Alluvial Deposits, Younger Dune Sands and Recent Coral Reef Sediments in the Holocene. The correlation of the Quaternary strata among various islands of Ryukyu Arc is shown in Table 1. The Shimajiri Group was deposited during the transgression from Upper Miocene to Lower Pleistocene, consisting mainly of thick mudstone with some intercalated sandstones and tuffs. The Ryukyu Limestone was deposited with a distinct unconformity on the Shimajiri Group and other basement rocks. Sand and gravel beds are found locally to replace part of the limestone. The Ryukyu Limestone is a continuous series of strata in which no great unconformity intervenes. It is generally 40 to 60 m thick and scarcely exceeds 100 m at the maximum. Faulting was remarkable after the deposition of the Ryukyu Limestone, cutting perpendicularly the island arc with accompanied uprise of the basement rocks. The terraces are generally divided into higher, middle, and lower groups, and the sediments forming these terraces comprise mainly sand and gravel and partly silt and limestone. In the Latest Pleistocene the land-area was much enlarged, owing to the lowering of ancient sea level and <b>reddish</b> <b>brown</b> <b>soil</b> was distributed on the subaerial flat place during that time, which now lies mostly under the sea. The sediments accompanied by the transgression during the period from the Latest Pleistocene to Holocene are distributed on the <b>reddish</b> <b>brown</b> <b>soil</b> with an unconformity, wheras the reef sediments were deposited around these islands. This redords a slight uprise of sea level, at least one meter higher than the present position at the peak phase of the transgression during at about 5, 000 to 4, 000 Y. B. P. There was the lowering of sea level down to two meters lower than the present position during the period of 3, 000 to 2, 000 Y. B. P. Accompanied by it Younger Dune Sands were formed along the present coast lines. The correlation of the geologic history from the latest Pleistocene to Holocene between Ryukyu and Kyushu is shown in Tables 3 and 4. ...|$|E
40|$|Numerous fossil remains (vertebrates, {{molluscs}} and plants) {{were found}} in more than twenty sites of the Süttő Travertine Complex during the last 150 years. The majority of these remains were recovered from fissures of the travertine, {{but also from the}} travertine and an overlying loess-paleosol sequence. The aims of this study were to review the fossil content, to determine the stratigraphical positions of the various vertebrate faunas of Süttő and provide paleoecological interpretation of the periods {{on the basis of their}} faunas and floras. In addition, this paper describes new faunas and floras from the sites Süttő 16 - 20 and provides 14 C dates for Süttő 16. On the basis of the new uranium series isotope and optical dating (OSL), the age of the travertine complex is Middle Pleistocene (235 +/- 21 - 314 +/- 45 ka, MIS 7 - 9), while the age of the loessepaleosol sequence in superposition of the travertine is MiddleeLate Pleistocene (MIS 2 -MIS 6). In contrast, the fossils of the travertine indicated an older, Pliocene-Early Pleistocene age. A fissure (Süttő 17) and a red clay layer (Süttő 19) contained mammal faunas of Early-Middle Pleistocene age. These results indicated the existence of older travertine in certain quarries (Hegyháti quarry, Cukor quarry). Sedimentological and OSL data of well-dated layers of the loess-paleosol sequence (Süttő/LPS) at Sütto allowed a correlation with the layers of Süttő 6. The paleosol layer in the upper part of the sequence of Sütto 6, was correlated with a pedocomplex of the overlying loess-paleosol sequence, which was dated to MIS 5 c (upper, dark soil) and MIS 5 e (lower, <b>reddish</b> <b>brown</b> <b>soil).</b> The paleoecological analysis of the mammal and mollusc faunas supported the former interpretation of Novothny et al. (2011) inferring warm, dry climate during the sedimentation of the upper layers, and more humid climate for the lower layers). However, the fauna of the lower soil layer indicated cold climate, so an age of MIS 5 d is suggested. Dating of the fissure faunas is based on similarity studies. For some faunas, this method cannot be used, because of the low number of species. On the basis of the species compositions and former interpretations, these faunas originated mainly from sediments that were deposited under cold climatic conditions. Other fissure faunas were dated by AMS 14 C (Süttő 16), or by correlation with soil layers of Süttő 6. According to these results, most of the fissure faunas can be correlated with different phases of MIS 5. However, there are a younger (MIS 2) and an older (Early-Middle Pleistocene) fissure fauna also...|$|E

The research focused on experimental study of the relationship between fines content and internal friction angle of lateritic soil. This was with a view to obtaining empirical relationships between the two parameters. Three samples of <b>reddish</b> <b>brown</b> tropical <b>soils</b> were obtained. The samples were subjected to laboratory analysis in their natural states and the index properties were determined. The fines contents were separated from the coarse components of the soils, and the samples were remoulded in varying ratios (fines:coarse). The resulting samples were subjected to triaxial tests to determine the shear strength parameters. Quantitative relationships between fines content and angle of internal friction of the soil samples were developed. The polynomial relationships gave the best relationship between the fines content and angle of internal friction of the soil samples...|$|R

40|$|Three {{compacted}} <b>reddish</b> <b>brown</b> tropical <b>soils</b> from Ibadan, Southwestern Nigerian, West Africa, {{were investigated}} {{in the laboratory}} for their suitability as hydraulic barriers for waste containment structure. The key parameters evaluated was the impact of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) landfill leachate on the geotechnical, mineralogical, long-term hydraulic conductivity and sorptive and diffusive properties of the soils. The effective diffusion coefficient D * value for Na + (2. 69 x 10 - 10 m 2 /s) in MP 3 increased to a peak value in MP 1 (3. 48 x 10 - 10 m 2 /s) with corresponding decrease in tortuosity factor. It {{can be seen that}} Na + Na + (0. 18) in MP 3 increased to 0. 29 in MP 1. Also, K +, Mg 2 + and Cl- also follow the same trend. In all, Na cations were found to diffuse faster than other ions including the only anion Cl. The effective diffusion coefficients of the cations and anion were found to be in the order of Na + < K + < Mg 2 + < Cl-. This finding suggests that the soils would be effective hydraulic barriers against the migration of potential contaminants in landfill leachate. It was also found that the presence of kaolinite as the major mineral allowed sorption of the ions that are generally considered conservative in linear-leachate compatibility studies on soils from tropical regions...|$|R
