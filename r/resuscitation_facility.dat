40|$|A {{prospective}} study of 3509 consecutive patients examined by excretion urography {{has been conducted}} to assess the incidence and significance of the untoward effects of urographic contrast media. Four compounds were used in doses containing 160 to 500 mg iodine/kg body weight. Toxic effects, arm pain, and allegic reactions were assessed separately, while the remainder were classified according {{to the influence of}} each reaction on the investigation and the need for treatment. From the results and {{a review of the literature}} we conclude that when there is a clear clinical indication for excretion urography a dose of contrast medium containing up to 600 mg iodine/kg body weight should be injected rapidly. Prophylactic antihistamine treatment and pretesting should be abandoned. Special care is needed for small infants and the lederly and for patients with renal or hepatic failure, myeloma, heart disease, or a history of previous major reaction.

40|$|Six {{patients}} with spontaneous angina associated with transient ST segment elevation had a multistate maximal exercise (bicycle) test. In 5 patients, typical electrocardiographic changes were recorded during exercise, namely ST segment elevation {{often accompanied by}} an increase in the voltage of the R wave and a widening of the QRS complex. Four of these patients developed severe rhythm disturbances: ventricular tachycardia (2 cases) and ventricular flutter (1 case) were the reason for early interruption of the test in 3 patients, while 1 patient had a short run of ventricular tachycardia after exercise. These rhythm disturbances which spontaneously regressed in all cases were consistently preceded by obvious ST elevation and in 2 patients were attended by slight chest discomfort. Maximal exercise testing of patients suspected of variant angina provides important diagnostic information in many patients, but the risks of potentially lethal arrhythmias should be considered and <b>resuscitation</b> <b>facilities</b> should always be immediately available...|$|R
40|$|Head {{injury is}} one of the common {{surgical}} condition which causes increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. 1, 2 It results from a number of factors including Road Traffic Accident (RTA), fall injury, physical assault etc. It is a source of major disability and huge financial and psychological burden upon society. Failure of adequate and timely managements results into a spectrum ranging from mild contusion to neurological deficit and death. Head injury {{is one of}} the common causes of surgical admission in Western Regional Hospital, Pokhara, Nepal. At the time of this study there were no neurosurgeons available at this region. At present though there is a neurosurgeon present, neurosurgical services are not fully available. Most of the cases have been managed quite effectively with few referrals and few deaths by adequately trained general surgeons in neurosurgery, anesthetists and nursing staffs together with computed tomography (CT) scan and <b>resuscitation</b> <b>facilities.</b> The aim of the study is to study the epidemiology, incidence and pattern of head injury, and their outcome in a genera...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} {{designed}} to evaluate the management of acute myocardial infarction in the general medical wards of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka. All patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted from September 1996  to August 1997, were evaluated with regard to the time delay in admission and drug treatment. The facilities for monitoring and resuscitation were also assessed. A total of 259  patients were included in the study, 173  males and 86  females. The median time delay from the onset of the pain to admission at the out-patients department was 12  hours and that between out-patients department admission and ward admission was 20  minutes. The median delay in obtaining a 12 -lead electrocardiogram when the patient was in the ward was 90  minutes. Review of the data showed that thrombolytic therapy, beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are underused. Complications were common. All the medical wards had adequate monitoring and <b>resuscitation</b> <b>facilities.</b> With adequate training of doctors and the availability of specialised cardiac nurses, thrombolytic therapy can be used effectively in medical wards.    Keywords: myocardial infarction; Sri Lanka; thrombolysi...|$|R
50|$|Challenge {{testing is}} not carried out until all {{symptoms}} have cleared or improved significantly {{for five days}} after a minimum period of two weeks on the elimination diet. The restrictions of the elimination diet is maintained throughout the challenge period. Open food challenges on wheat and milk {{can be carried out}} first, then followed by challenge periods with natural food chemicals, then with food additives. Challenges can take the form of purified food chemicals or with foods grouped according to food chemical. Purified food chemicals are used in double blind placebo controlled testing, and food challenges involve foods containing only one suspect food chemical eaten several times a day over 3 to 7 days. If a reaction occurs patients must wait until all symptoms subside completely and then wait a further 3 days (to overcome a refractory period) before recommencing challenges. Patients with a history of asthma, laryngeal oedema or anaphylaxis may be hospitalised as inpatients or attended in specialist clinics where <b>resuscitation</b> <b>facilities</b> are available for the testing.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} all {{dextropropoxyphene}} poisoning episodes {{in a stable}} representative population during the past 10 years showed that Distalgesic accounts for most overdoses, {{and it has become}} an increasingly popular component of self-poisoning coktails. Sudden respiratory depression due to dextopropoxyphene potentiated by other common ingested agents is the main danger, and at least one-third of patients take a potentially lethal dose (20 tablets of Distalgesic and alcohol or benzodiazepine). Naloxone is an effective antagonist but, because of the rapidity of deterioration, 40 % of patients sustain irreversible cerebral damage before reaching <b>resuscitation</b> <b>facilities.</b> Consequently Distalgesic has become the ingested agent principally responsible for self-poisoning deaths over the age of 12 years. This rise to prominence has paralleled a pronounced increase in prescriptions for the drug. The reason for the increased rise in selfpoisoning remains elusive. As effective treatment of the cause is not possible the only way to mitigate its serious consequences is prompt treatment and restrictions on the availability of the drug. No analgesics are devoid of danger in overdose, but in dextropropoxyphene the evidence suggests that its dangers outweigh its analgesic properties...|$|R
30|$|Influenza vaccine - Despite a {{theoretical}} risk of hypersensitivity reactions to minimal amount of egg-proteins [21, 22] in influenza vaccine, studies, including papers and abstracts, from 1977 to 2012 {{showed that in}} 4172 egg-allergic patients (and 513 with severe allergic reaction), safety of influenza vaccine has been proven, with especial regard to both severe anaphylactic reactions (respiratory distress or hypotension) and mild reactions (urticaria or mild wheezing) [23]. These allergic reactions rates {{did not differ significantly}} from those in non-egg-allergic controls [24 - 26]. In investigations published {{in the last ten years}} [21, 23 - 37] the frequency of allergic reactions to vaccine was 2.62 % in 6532 subjects (Table  1). The American Academy of Paediatrics [19] has recently stated that the risks of missing influenza vaccination outweigh those from vaccination itself. Therefore, egg allergy of any severity (including anaphylaxis) is not a contraindication to the administration of influenza vaccine. However, influenza vaccine should be administrated when <b>resuscitation</b> <b>facilities</b> are available, and the patient should be observed in the office for 30  minutes after immunization [19]. In egg-allergic patients the injectable vaccine should be preferred rather than intranasal preparation because of an higher amounts of ovalbumin in the latter [5]. Influenza vaccine contains less than 1  μg/dose of ovalbumin. Those with an higher amount (more than 1.2  μg/mL) should be avoided in egg-allergic subjects [38]. Influenza vaccine cultured on human cells or insect culture are not approved for pediatric use.|$|R
40|$|Background: Resuscitation with bag and mask is a high-impact {{intervention}} that can reduce neonatal deaths in resource-poor countries. This study assessed {{the capacity to}} perform newborn <b>resuscitation</b> at <b>facilities</b> offering comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) in Afghanistan, {{as well as individual}} and facility characteristics associated with providers' knowledge and clinical skills. Methods: Assessors interviewed 82 doctors and 142 midwives at 78 facilities on their knowledge of newborn resuscitation and observed them perform the procedure on an anatomical model. Supplies, equipment, and infrastructure were assessed at each facility. Descriptive statistics and simple and multivariate regression analyses were performed using STATA 11. 2 and SAS 9. 1. 3. Results: Over 90 % of facilities had essential equipment for newborn resuscitation, including a mucus extractor, bag, and mask. More than 80 % of providers had been trained on newborn resuscitation, but midwives were more likely than doctors to receive such training as part of pre-service education (59 % and 35 %, respectively, p < 0. 001). No {{significant differences were found between}} doctors and midwives on knowledge, clinical skills, or confidence in performing newborn resuscitation. Doctors and midwives scored 71 % and 66 %, respectively, on knowledge questions and 66 % and 71 % on the skills assessment; 75 % of doctors and 83 % of midwives felt very confident in their ability to perform newborn resuscitation. Training was associated with greater knowledge (p < 0. 001) and clinical skills (p < 0. 05) in a multivariable model that adjusted for facility type, provider type, and years of experience offering EmONC services. Conclusions: Lack of equipment and training do not pose major barriers to newborn resuscitation in Afghanistan, but providers' knowledge and skills need strengthening in some areas. Midwives proved to be as capable as doctors of performing newborn resuscitation, which validates the major investment made in midwifery education. Competency-based pre-service and in-service training, complemented by supportive supervision, is an effective way to build providers' capacity to perform newborn resuscitation. This kind of training could also help skilled birth attendants based in the community, at private clinics, or at primary care facilities save the lives of newborns. © 2013 Kim et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{global burden}} of {{stillbirth}} and neonatal deaths remains achallenge in low-income countries. Training in neonatal resuscitation canreduce intrapartum stillbirth and early neonatal mortality. Previous resultsdemonstrate that infants who previously {{would have been}} registered asstillbirths are successfully resuscitated after such training, suggesting thatthere {{is a process of}} selection for resuscitation that needs to be explored. Objective: To compare neonatal resuscitation of low birth weight andnormal birth weight infants born at a facility in a low-income setting. Methods: Motion-triggered video cameras were installed above theresuscitation tables at a maternity health facility during an interventionstudy (ISRCTN 97846009) employing the Helping Babies Breatheresuscitation protocol in Kathmandu, Nepal. Recordings were analysed,noting crying, stimulation, ventilation, suctioning and oxygenadministration during resuscitation. Birth weight, Apgar scores and sex ofthe infant were retrieved from matched hospital registers. The results wereanalysed by chi-square and logistic regression. Results: A total of 2253 resuscitation cases were recorded. Low birthweight infants in need of resuscitation had higher odds of receivingventilation (aOR 1. 73), and lower odds of receiving suctioning (aOR 0. 53) after adjustment for the Helping Babies Breathe intervention, sex of theinfant and place of <b>resuscitation</b> within the <b>facility.</b> The rate of stimulationand administration of oxygen was the same in both groups. Conclusions: Low birth weight was associated with more ventilation andless suctioning during neonatal resuscitation in a low-income setting. Asventilation is the most important intervention when the infant does notinitiate breathing after birth, low birth weight was not a predictor for thedecision to withhold resuscitation. Frequent routine use of suctioning of thelower airways continues to be a problem in the studied context, even afterthe introduction of the Helping Babies Breathe protocol...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Of 136 million {{babies born}} annually, around 10 million require {{assistance}} to breathe. Each year 814, 000 neonatal deaths result from intrapartum-related events in term babies (previously “birth asphyxia”) and 1. 03 million from complications of prematurity. No systematic assessment of mortality reduction from tactile stimulation or resuscitation has been published. Objective To estimate the mortality effect of immediate newborn assessment and stimulation, and basic resuscitation on neonatal deaths due to term intrapartum-related events or preterm birth, for facility and home births. Methods We conducted systematic reviews for studies reporting relevant mortality or morbidity outcomes. Evidence {{was assessed using}} GRADE criteria adapted to provide a systematic approach to mortality effect estimates for the Lives Saved Tool (LiST). Meta-analysis was performed if appropriate. For interventions with low quality evidence but strong recommendation for implementation, a Delphi panel was convened to estimate effect size. Results We identified 24 studies of neonatal resuscitation reporting mortality outcomes (20 observational, 2 quasi-experimental, 2 cluster randomized controlled trials), but none of immediate newborn assessment and stimulation alone. A meta-analysis of three facility-based studies examined the effect of resuscitation training on intrapartum-related neonatal deaths (RR= 0. 70, 95 %CI 0. 59 - 0. 84); this estimate {{was used for the}} effect of facility-based basic neonatal resuscitation (additional to stimulation). The evidence for preterm mortality effect was low quality and thus expert opinion was sought. In community-based studies, resuscitation training was part of packages with multiple concurrent interventions, and/or studies did not distinguish term intrapartum-related from preterm deaths, hence no meta-analysis was conducted. Our Delphi panel of 18 experts estimated that immediate newborn assessment and stimulation would reduce both intrapartum-related and preterm deaths by 10 %, facility-based resuscitation would prevent a further 10 % of preterm deaths, and community-based resuscitation would prevent further 20 % of intrapartum-related and 5 % of preterm deaths. Conclusion Neonatal <b>resuscitation</b> training in <b>facilities</b> reduces term intrapartum-related deaths by 30 %. Yet, coverage of this intervention remains low in countries where most neonatal deaths occur and is a missed opportunity to save lives. Expert opinion supports smaller effects of neonatal resuscitation on preterm mortality in facilities and of basic resuscitation and newborn assessment and stimulation at community level. Further evaluation is required for impact, cost and implementation strategies in various contexts.

40|$|Hair {{transplantation}} is {{a surgical}} method of hair restoration. Physician qualification : The physician performing hair transplantation should have completed post graduation training in dermatology; {{he should have}} adequate background training in dermatosurgery at a centre that provides education training in cutaneous surgery. In addition, he should obtain specific hair transplantation training or experience at the surgical table(hands on) {{under the supervision of}} an appropriately trained and experienced hair transplant surgeon. In addition to the surgical technique, training should include instruction in local anesthesia and emergency <b>resuscitation</b> and care. <b>Facility</b> : Hair transplantation can be performed safely in an outpatient day case dermatosurgical facility. The day case theatre should be equipped with facilities for monitoring and handling emergencies. A plan for handling emergencies should be in place and all nursing staff should be familiar with the emergency plan. It is preferable, but not mandatory to have a standby anesthetist. Indication for hair transplantation is pattern hair loss in males and also in females. In female pattern hair loss, investigations to rule out any underlying cause for hair loss such as anemia and thyroid deficiency should be carried out. Hair transplantation can also be performed in selected cases of scarring alopecia, eyebrows and eye lashes, by experienced surgeons. Preoperative counseling and informed consent :Detailed consent form listing details about the procedure and possible complications should be signed by the patient. The consent form should specifically state the limitations of the procedure and if more procedures are needed for proper results, it should be clearly mentioned. Patient should be provided with adequate opportunity to seek information through brochures, computer presentations, and personal discussions. Need for concomitant medical therapy should be emphasized. Patients should understand that proper hair growth can be expected after about 9 months after transplantation. Preoperative laboratory studies to be performed include Hb&#x 0025;, blood counts including platelet count, bleeding and clotting time (or prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time), blood chemistry profile including sugar. Methods : Follicular unit hair transplantation is the gold standard method of hair transplantation; it preserves the natural architecture of the hair units and gives natural results. Mini-micro-grafting is a method hair transplantation involving randomly assorted groups of hairs, with out consideration of their natural configuration of follicular units, under loupe or naked eye examination. Mini-grafts consist of 4 - 5 - 6 hairs while micro-grafts consist of 1 - 3 hairs. Punch gives ugly cosmetically unacceptable results and should no longer be used. Patient Selection : Hair transplantation can be performed in any person with pattern hair loss, with good donor area, in good general health and reasonable expectations. Caution should be exercised in, very young patients whose early alopecia is still evolving, patients with Norwood grade VI or VII with poor density, patients with unrealistic expectations, and patients with significant systemic health problems. Medical therapy: Most patients will need concurrent medical treatment since the process of pattern hair loss is progressive and may affect the remaining hairs. Manpower : Hair transplantation is a team effort. Particularly, performing large sessions, needs a well trained team of trained assistants. Anesthesia: 2 &#x 0025; lignocaine with adrenaline is generally used for anesthesia; tumescent technique is preferred. Bupivacaine has been used by some authors in view of its prolonged duration of action. Donor dissection : Strip dissection by single blade is recommended for donor area. Steromicroscopic dissection is recommended for dissection of hair units in follicular unit transplantation; mini-micro-grafting does not need microscopic dissection. Recipient insertion : Different techniques and different instruments have been used for recipient site creation;these depend on the choice of the operating surgeon and have been described in the guidelines. Graft preservation is important to ensure survival. Density : Minimum density of 35 - 45 units per sq cm is recommended. Results depend on donor characteristics, technique used and individual skills of the surgeo...|$|R
40|$|Definition : Tumescent liposuction is a {{technique}} {{for the removal of}} subcutaneous fat under a special form of local anesthesia called tumescent anesthesia. Physician&#x 2032;s qualifications : The physician performing liposuction should have completed postgraduate training in dermatology or a surgical specialty and should have had adequate training in dermatosurgery at a center that provides training in cutaneous surgery. In addition, the physician should obtain specific liposuction training or experience at the surgical table ("hands on") under the supervision of an appropriately trained and experienced liposuction surgeon. In addition to the surgical technique, training should include instruction in fluid and electrolyte balance, potential complications of liposuction, tumescent and other forms of anesthesia as well as emergency <b>resuscitation</b> and care. <b>Facility</b> : Liposuction can be performed safely in an outpatient day care surgical facility, or a hospital operating room. The day care theater should be equipped with facilities for monitoring and handling emergencies. A plan for handling emergencies should be in place with which all nursing staff should be familiar. A physician trained in emergency medical care and acute cardiac emergencies should be available in the premises. It is recommended but not mandatory, that an anesthetist be asked to stand by. Indications: Liposuction is recommended for all localized deposits of fat. Novices should restrict themselves to the abdomen, thighs, buttocks and male breasts. Arms, the medial side of the thigh and the female breast need more experience and are recommended for experienced surgeons. Liposuction may be performed for non-cosmetic indications such as hyperhidrosis of axillae after adequate experience has been acquired, but is not recommended for the treatment of obesity. Preoperative evaluation : Detailed history is to be taken with respect to any previous disease, drug intake and prior surgical procedures. Liposuction is contraindicated in patients with severe cardiovascular disease, severe coagulation disorders including thrombophilia, and during pregnancy. Physical evaluation should be detailed and should include assessment of general physical health to determine the fitness of the patient for surgery, as well as the examination of specific sites that need liposuction to check for potential problems. Preoperative Informed consent : The patient should sign a detailed consent form listing details about the procedure and possible complications. The consent form should specifically state the limitations of the procedure and should mention whether more procedures are needed for proper results. The patient should be provided with adequate opportunity to seek information through brochures, computer presentations, and personal discussions. Preoperative laboratory studies to be performed include Hb&#x 0025;, blood counts including platelet counts, bleeding and clotting time (or prothrombin and activated partial thromboplastin time) and blood chemistry profile; ECG is advisable. Liver function tests, and pregnancy test for women of childbearing age are performed as mandated by the individual patient&#x 2032;s requirements. Ultrasound examination is recommended in cases of gynecomastia. Preoperative medication : Preoperative antibiotics and non-sedative analgesics such as paracetamol are recommended. The choice of antibiotic and analgesic agents depends on the individual physician&#x 2032;s preference and the prevailing local conditions. Type of anesthetic employed : Lidocaine is the preferred local anesthetic; its recommended dose is 35 - 45 mg/kg and doses should not exceed 55 mg/kg wt. The recommended concentration of epinephrine in tumescent solutions is 0. 25 - 1. 5 mg/L. The total dosage of epinephrine should be minimized and should not exceed 50 &#x 00 B 5;g/kg. Surgical technique/procedure It is always advisable not to combine liposuction with other procedures to avoid exceeding the recommended dosage of lignocaine. However, such combinations may be attempted if the total required dose of lignocaine does not exceed the maximum dose indicated above. The recommended cannula size for liposuction is not to be larger than 3. 5 mm in diameter. The recommended volume of fat removed is in proportion to the fat content and/or size and/or weight of the patient being treated. It is recommended that the volume of fat removed not exceed 5000 mL in a single operative session. Large volume liposuctions or mega-liposuctions are not recommended. Intraoperative and postoperative monitoring : Baseline vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate, are recorded pre- and postoperatively. Pulse oximeter monitoring is essential in all cases. Postoperative care: Postoperative antibiotics should be selected by the physician and taken for five days. Postoperative antiinflammatory drugs such as Cox 2 Inhibiters may be given for 5 - 7 days; specialized compression garments, binders, and tape help to reduce bruising, hematomas, seromas, and pain. Generally, compression is recommended for two weeks although this is variable according {{to the needs of the}} individual patient...|$|R
