2500|$|Over time, ballast is crushed {{or moved}} {{by the weight of}} trains passing over it, {{periodically}} requiring <b>relevelling</b> ("tamping") and eventually to be cleaned or replaced. If this is not done, the tracks may become uneven causing swaying, rough riding and possibly derailments. An alternative to tamping is to lift the rails and sleepers and reinsert the ballast beneath. For this, specialist [...] "stoneblower" [...] trains are used.|$|E
50|$|The Dockline Tramway {{has closed}} {{a number of}} times for the {{gentrification}} of streets around Wynyard Quarter which have involved <b>relevelling</b> the roads. For instance in until October 2014, and again from mid 2015 until late 2016 while Gaunt Street and the southern end of Daldy Street were gentrified. As of April 2017, trams are running on a short section of the line while roadworks and gentrification occur in Halsey Street and Daldy Street, including watergardens and realignment of the tramway along the reinstated Daldy Street.|$|E
40|$|In {{connection}} with the precise levelling done this summer at volcano Asama, latitude determinations {{were made by the}} writer at Koasama and Boroku triangulation points, both of which are situated on the eastern slope of the volcano. The reason for doing it was to determine the present shape of the geoid, in order to obtain data to enable us to distinguish the change in shape of the geoid from true deformations of the volcano, when <b>relevelling</b> the mountain in the future. The results of the observation are 36 ° 24 ′ 36 ″・ 519 ± 0 ″・ 052, Koasama, 36 ° 22 ′ 59 ″・ 75 ± 0 ・ 21, Boroku. Besides these observations, a rough estimate of the longitude was made at Koasama, giving 9 h 14 m 15 s 424 ± 0 s 125. These values give deviations of vertical(A-G) of the following magnitudes : Koasama: { 12 ″ 07 in latitude; -Xs 260 in longitude;} Boroku : 3 ″ 79 in latitude...|$|E
50|$|The dam is an earth {{embankment}} {{made of a}} {{clay core}} and earth filled shoulders. In 1969 the dam wall was built up by 6.6 ft with plastic concrete and <b>relevelled.</b> The spillways and overflow are made of ashlar pitching set on concrete. It is 41.3 ft in height with a slope of 12.7 degrees, with two lateral overflow stepped spillways. The reservoir covers an area of 35 acre and is about 46 ft deep.|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{force and}} moment {{measuring}} instrumentation at NASA LaRC are calibrated by applying NIST certified dead loads, to generate forces and moments in three orthogonal axes, in twenty five percent increments, up to full-load {{and down to}} no-load in a nine point continuous procedure, using specially built calibration stands. The measuring instruments deflect upon the application of loads. These deflections must be cancelled to minimize loading interactions. The older calibration stands, integrated with AC induction motors, or DC motors, have provisions for manually releveling the loading point after each load. A newer stand, with integrated DC stepper motors, <b>relevels</b> automatically under software control. It was proposed to extend automation to the old stands. An algorithm to control the unwieldy induction motors to <b>relevel</b> a calibration stand, to within two arcseconds of horizontal direction automatically, was developed. The system developed uses coasting prediction and load adaptation in a general type robust stability control configuration with noncoincidental feedback. Automatic releveling cuts the releveling time to {{approximately half of the}} time required to do it manually. The principal constraint for shorter times is the time constant of the angular position feedback transducer...|$|R
50|$|Automatic levels {{make use}} of a {{compensator}} that ensures that the line of sight remains horizontal once the operator has roughly leveled the instrument (to within maybe 0.05 degree). The surveyor sets the instrument up quickly and doesn't have to <b>relevel</b> it carefully each time he sights on a rod on another point. It also reduces the effect of minor settling of the tripod to the actual amount of motion instead of leveraging the tilt over the sight distance. Three level screws are used to level the instrument.|$|R
40|$|The {{presented}} study {{deals with}} the optimization of fire properties of CFRP fuselage materials in a "pool-fire" scenario (a kerosene fire underneath an aircraft on ground) with the aim to increase the time until the structure fails. For this purpose hybrid material systems are being developed where the flame retardant is directly incorporated into the material. In this way, weight can be saved and the peeling effect, which is common for finishes, would be prevented. Due to the very high heat flux during a kerosene fire, powdered additives and layers are introduced into the composite, which form a thermal barrier or a barrier for gases in case of fire and protect the underlying structure {{from the effects of}} the flames. Of these materials, the fire behaviour with regard to smoke density and smoke toxicity is determined. The results show a significant reduction of smoke density for most of the tested materials and comply with the limits of toxic gases for cabin material systems. For a realistic <b>relevelling</b> of the “pool-fire” scenario, a test facility with a propane torch was build, which creates a heat flux of 180 kW/m². In this test, the specimens are exposed to flames for 4 min and the temperature profile at their backside is recorded with a thermocouple. In order to investigate the mechanical damage of the materials trough the fire, additional specimen were exposed to flame for 15 s and the remaining compressive strength was determined. It was found that in particular a titanium foil under the top layer can contribute significantly to improvements in the mechanical properties as well as to slow down the temperature rise {{on the back of the}} material...|$|E
5000|$|Destinys first DLC pack, The Dark Below, was {{released}} on December 9, 2014. The expansion added new content centering on the Hive race and their deity Crota, Son of Oryx, who had been referenced in the original game. Four story missions, a strike, and a raid were added. New bounties, equipment, and three Crucible maps were also added, {{as well as two}} Crucible modes: [...] "Inferno", a modifier on multiple modes where points are solely scored on kills and the player's radar is disabled, and [...] "Doubles", a two-versus-two version of Skirmish. Maximum weapon attack damage was increased to 331 for new legendary and exotic weapons, and the Light level cap was increased to 32. Although previous legendary items could not be upgraded to the new stats, exotic items earned prior to the expansion's release could be upgraded through Xûr with the Exotic Shard material, however, players lost all previously earned perks, requiring them to <b>relevel</b> their exotics. An additional exotic weapon ("The 4th Horseman" [...] shotgun) and another strike ("The Undying Mind") were timed exclusives for PlayStation platforms until September 2015. A hard mode for the raid was added on January 21, 2015.|$|R
5000|$|House of Wolves {{received}} better reception {{than its}} predecessor, The Dark Below. It has an aggregrate score of 72/100 for the PlayStation 4 version (based on 31 reviews) and 71/100 for the Xbox One version (based on 4 reviews) from Metacritic—no score {{is available for}} the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions. Jose Otero of IGN, who gave it a 7.5/10, said that the expansion [...] "learns from its predecessor's mistakes." [...] Although it did not fix Destinys issues with the story or its loot system, [...] "it does introduce new, sensible gear upgrade paths, a fun new campaign with a few surprises, and rewarding endgame activities". There was less grinding as gear dropped at higher levels than previously, however, this only applied to House of Wolves gear. The new Etheric Light material was praised, as it let all previous legendary gear be upgraded to the new stats without having to <b>relevel</b> the gear, although the material was a rare drop. The Prison of Elders PvE arena was praised, but Otero {{said that there was}} not a lot of variety in its objectives. He said that although it was not as impressive as a raid, [...] "it's unique enough to stand on its own merits." [...] Trials of Osiris was also praised. Martin Robinson of Eurogamer had similar remarks and said the expansion [...] "delivers an overhaul of systems and a stream of modes and features that are the best thing to happen to Destiny since its launch." [...] He said it felt like Bungie remembered what made their previous games so special. Robinson highly praised the new sidearm weapon, calling it one of Bungie's best guns on par with pistols in their previous Halo games. The new level cap was praised for being easier to obtain than previously. He said that although the expansion was not a radical overhaul, it was a serious step in the right direction.|$|R
40|$|New {{railway track}} is laid to a {{specified}} level and alignment. However, {{with time and}} trafficking movements occur in the ballast bed and the underlying subgrade, and frequent maintenance is necessary to re-establish the correct geometry. This is currently done {{by the process of}} tamping, where extra material is vibrated under the sleeper to raise its level. Unfortunately this is not permanent, and the sleeper eventually reverts to its premaintenance state. Prior to mechanised tamping, track was <b>relevelled</b> by hand shovel packing in which the sleepers were raised and fine aggregate shovelled into the space under the sleeper, giving a permanent lift. A prototype of a mechanised version of this process, called the Stoneblower, has been developed and is currently undergoing field trials. It lifts the sleeper and blows single size stone smaller than the ballast into the void space, creating a two layer granular foundation for each sleeper. In order to get {{a better understanding of the}} behaviour of a two layer granular foundation when subjected to repeated loading a laboratory study involving large scale cyclic triaxial testing of single size and two layer ballast has been carried out. This has been complemented by a large scale model study using a 'half sleeper rig' in which ballast beds similar to those produced by stoneblowing have been subjected to repeated loading simulating long term railway trafficking. These tests have been used to carry out a parametric study into stone angularity, stone size and layer geometry to assess their influence on the layered system, with the results being assessed primarily in terms of the resilient modulus and plastic deformation undergone by the material. In the triaxial tests it was found that the layer of smaller material was the major controlling factor for the deformation. However, the layer of larger material tended to act as a restraint, effectively reducing the HID ratio of the specimen. In the model testing, it was found that the smaller material dictated how the load was transmitted to the ballast bed, and this was then responsible for the majority of the settlement...|$|R
