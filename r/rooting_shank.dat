Work directed toward the higher temperature area of concern in the primary gas path includes effects of coatings on the behavior and properties of the materials of interest. The blade root attachment work areas will address the effects of stress concentrations associated with attachment features...|$|R

In this article, we shall deal with the connections between the rank of apparition of prime/? in the Fibonacci sequence and the Fibonacci Primitive Roots. We shall prove the following theorems: Theorem 1, The congruence * 2 ^x-/- / (mod/?) is solvable {{if and only if}}/?- / is divisible by a(p) or/?= 5. Theorem 2. If/? = 10 k ± 1 is a prime number and there exist two Fibonacci Primitive Roots (mod/?) or no Fibonacci Primitive Root exists, then a(p) <p- 1.
