25|$|The T38 started {{life with}} a 19-stage axial compressor, eight can type {{combustion}} chambers, a 4-stage turbine driving the compressor and the extension shaft to the <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Nimbus is a {{turboshaft}} engine comprising a gas generator section, {{which consists of}} a three-stage compressor, (two axial stages and one centrifugal stage), driven by a two-stage turbine in conjunction with an annular combustion chamber, and a power output section consisting of a single-stage free turbine driving an output shaft via a two-stage <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 330 was {{somewhat}} slower {{than most of}} its pressurised competition, but it built up {{a reputation as a}} comfortable, quiet and rugged airliner. The quiet running of the Pratt & Whitney PT6A-45R was largely due to an efficient <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox.</b> The cabin {{was the result of a}} collaboration with Boeing engineers who modelled the interior space, fittings and decor after larger airliners. The use of a sturdy structure complete with the traditional Short braced-wing-and-boxy-fuselage configuration also led to an ease of maintenance and serviceability.|$|E

50|$|All her deck {{machinery}} was electrically powered. Her engines were flexibly mounted, to reduce vibration and noise. Oil-operated reverse <b>reduction</b> <b>gearboxes</b> were fitted, {{rather than an}} additional, heavy reversing engine. She was given a mainmast in 1953.|$|R
5000|$|The ship {{is powered}} by two Wärtsilä 16V26 diesel engines each {{developing}} [...] continuous power. The engines drive two shafts with Lips inboard turning controllable pitch propellers via single <b>reduction</b> <b>gearboxes.</b> Each propeller is 2,500 mm in diameter and functions at 300 rpm.|$|R
25|$|Union Rotorua {{was unusual}} {{in that she}} was powered by gas turbine. The ship's main gas turbine / {{electric}} machinery consisted of a single General Electric MM5262RB gas turbine operating on a regenerative cycle. This was coupled to an AC generator to provide a maximum designed continuous rating of 18822kW for a motor propeller speed of 200rpm. The turbine speed of 4670rpm was reduced to 1500rpm for the generator by a <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox.</b> The generator output 6.6kV 3-phase at 50Hz to the ships motors. There were four closed air circuit water cooled synchronous A.C. motors, arranged with two per shaft. Previous USSCo vessels had traditionally had twin outward turning fixed pitch propellers, however Union Rotorua has twin inward turning controllable pitch propellers. This decision {{was made in the}} interests of maneuverability, since the center of thrust is in the outer part of the disk thus giving a larger turning moment arm. In normal running configuration the whole system could be controlled by a single lever from the bridge. The speed of the gas turbine was controlled by a solid state control and safety system integrated with the propulsion controls.|$|E
25|$|The {{fuselage}} {{structure was}} unusual and innovative, being {{based on a}} strong central keel that incorporated the armament, cockpit, and engine. Two strong fuselage beams to port and starboard {{formed the basis of}} the structure. These angled upwards fore and aft to create mounting points for the T9 cannon and propeller <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox</b> and for the engine and accessories respectively. A strong arched bulkhead provided the main structural attachment point for the main spar of the wing. This arch incorporated a fireproof panel and an armor plate between the engine and the cockpit. It also incorporated a turnover pylon and a pane of bullet-resistant glass behind the pilot's head. The arch also formed the basis of the cockpit housing; the pilot's seat was attached to the forward face as was the cockpit floor. Forward of the cockpit the fuselage nose was formed from large removable covers. A long nose wheel well was incorporated in the lower nose section. The engine and accessories were attached {{to the rear of the}} arch and the main structural beams; these too were covered using large removable panels. A conventional semi-monocoque rear fuselage was attached aft of the main structure.|$|E
500|$|The {{engine room}} on a bulker is usually near the stern, under the superstructure. Larger bulkers, from Handymax up, {{usually have a}} single {{two-stroke}} low-speed crosshead diesel engine directly coupled to a fixed-pitch propeller. Electricity is produced by auxiliary generators and/or an alternator coupled to the propeller shaft. On the smaller bulkers, one or two four-stroke diesels are used to turn either a fixed or controllable-pitch propeller via a <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox,</b> which may also incorporate an output for an alternator. The average design ship speed for bulkers of Handysize and above is [...] The propeller speed is relatively low, at about 90 revolutions per minute, although {{it depends on the}} size of the propeller.|$|E

2500|$|The airship was {{designed}} by the prominent balloon manufacturer Édouard Surcouf and Henry Kapférer. [...] It was powered by a 70hp 4-cylinder Argus engine driving a single propeller {{at the front of}} the nacelle via a 5:1 <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox.</b> The engine also drove a pump to maintain pressure in the internal ballonet. [...] The nacelle was a square-section wire-braced wooden structure which had been used in the unsuccessful design of 1902, and carried a pair of rudders at the rear and a pair of biplane elevators. [...] The most novel feature of the design were the tail surfaces, which consisted of elongated tubes inflated with hydrogen. These were the result of research carried out by Charles Renard.|$|E
2500|$|Since Wankel engines {{operate at}} a {{relatively}} high rotational speed, at 6,000 rpm of output shaft, the Rotor makes only 2,000 turns. With relatively low torque, propeller driven aircraft must use a propeller speed reduction unit to maintain propellers within the designed speed range. Experimental aircraft with Wankel engines use propeller speed reduction units, for instance the MidWest twin-rotor engine has a 2.95:1 <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox.</b> [...] The rotational shaft speed of a Wankel engine is high compared to reciprocating piston designs. Only the eccentric shaft spins fast, while the rotors turn at exactly one-third of the shaft speed. If the shaft is spinning at 7,500 rpm, the rotors are turning at a much slower 2,500 rpm.|$|E
2500|$|The engines {{featured}} a large diameter lightweight flywheel at the rear, enclosed {{in a cast}} housing. Engine oil was picked {{up from the bottom}} of the crankcase and slung into a reservoir at the top. [...] From there it was gravity fed, via a gallery high on the right side of the engine block, to the main bearing caps, and then to the connecting rod journals by centrifugal effect of the turning crankshaft. [...] The main bearings were ball bearings and were splash fed. [...] Engine oil from the gallery was also supplied to the 1 : 2 <b>reduction</b> <b>gearbox</b> at the front. This drove the four-bladed propeller at one half engine speed, and the single camshaft was splined into the rear of the short propeller shaft. [...] This arrangement meant that no mechanical oil pump was needed.|$|E

50|$|Although the {{diesel-electric}} powertrain is {{the preferred}} choice for icebreakers due to the good low speed torque characteristics of the electric propulsion motors, icebreakers have also been built with diesel engines mechanically coupled to <b>reduction</b> <b>gearboxes</b> and controllable pitch propellers. The mechanical powertrain has several advantages over diesel-electric propulsion systems, such as lower weight and better fuel efficiency. However, diesel engines are sensitive to sudden changes in propeller revolutions, and to counter this mechanical powertrains are usually fitted with large flywheels or hydrodynamic couplings to absorb the torque variations resulting from propeller-ice interaction.|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 85 - 96 The {{objective}} of this work is to minimize the maximum bearing temperatures under severe operating conditions in speed increasing and <b>reduction</b> <b>gearboxes,</b> and to present experimental data to validate the theoretical assumptions. The test machine, the experimental results, and the comparison between theoretical thermoelastohydrodynamic results and experimental data are presented. The test bearings are located in two speed increasing and <b>reduction</b> <b>gearboxes</b> (back-to-hack test bed). The high speed shaft bearings are five shoe tilting-pad journal bearings. They are 160 mm in diameter and the bearing ratio (L/D) is equal to 1. 0. The rotational speed varies from 2700 rpm (22 m/s) to 11, 880 rpm (100 m/s). The applied load is up to 88 kN. Three types of bearings permit analyzing {{the influence of the}} bearing design and the pivot position on the pad. The low speed rotor bearings are offset-halves journal bearings. They are 230 mm in diameter and the bearing ratio is equal to 0. 75. The rotational speed varies from 765 rpm (9. 0 m/s) to 3366 rpm (40 m/s). The applied load is up to 100 kN. The influence of the load direction and of the oil feeding temperature is studied. For each test, bearings, temperatures (film/pad interface, oil, pad and housing), power losses and oil flow are measured. Shifting the pivot from the central position to at least the 55 percent position leads to a decrease of the maximum temperature. The bearing design and materials contribute to improve its performance, especially a decrease of maximum temperature and power loss...|$|R
