40|$|The paper substantiates the {{necessity}} for creation of a technological machinery system in multi-industry construction complex that is from development of raw material resources and production of construction materials (logging and mining industry, woodworking, production of crushed stone, cement, concrete etc.) to construction of actual 3 D and plate objects. Attention has been attracted to continuous renovation of construction technologies and emergence of new construction materials that requires corresponding technical facilities for their efficient application and creation of these facilities is lagging behind under existing conditions. Such approach leads to saturation of the Republican machinery park by import equipment and technology that correspond to introduced technologies and construction materials according to their parameters. In order to ensure success in import substitution {{it is necessary to}} create a prospective system of technological machinery that corresponds to new technologies and materials. Experience in creation of separate fragments of the machinery system reveals machinery similarity irrespective of construction complex sector. Such approach permits to create multi-functional technical facilities having not only similar basic machines but key equipment as well that differs only in design of finite element of working tool. It has been established that multi-functionality favours a significant reduction in financial expenses for <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> <b>machinery</b> parks and an increase of modular machine number. It has been shown that the machinery system prompts in due time what technical facilities are to be created in order to realize non-waste technologies in the construction complex which are completed by production of certain useful products. </p...|$|E
60|$|A {{thorough}} <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> the bell-ringing <b>machinery</b> {{and accessories}} {{had taken place}} in anticipation of an interesting event. New ropes had been provided; every bell had been carefully shifted from its carriage, and the pivots lubricated. Bright red 'sallies' of woollen texture--soft to the hands and easily caught--glowed on the ropes in place of the old ragged knots, all of which newness in small details only rendered more evident the irrepressible aspect of age in the mass surrounding them.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The article {{deals with}} three {{different}} models of the choice of tractor aggregates characterised by different installed conditions of the performed work. Such conditions are: a definite amount of the performed work; fixed agrotechnical terms for completion of the work; possible losses of the yield of crops because of deferred completion {{of the work in}} relation to the optimum terms. A method of economico-mathematical simulation is applied. The essence of the method for the choice of tractor aggregates lies in the determination of minimal specific variable losses taking into account the factors indicated above. Using the results of the data calculation, a limit was shown for efficient application of aggregates selected from each of the models. The proposed method allows motivated choice of an economically efficient tractor aggregate depending on the installed conditions of the performed work, as well as prognostication of economic expediency for <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>machinery</b> mentioned above. Solver, a superstructure of the MS Excel, was used for the calculation of the mathematical model solving it as a task of optimising non-linear programming. As an example, there is given a choice of sowing tractor aggregates, using various models. Key words: amount of work, specific costs, tractor aggregate, economico-mathematical simulation...|$|R

40|$|The milk {{production}} effectiveness {{is very hard}} to achieve. The reason is the high realizing price fluctuations of milk. Only the company which has high-quality herd with excellent efficiency and milk quality, supported by modern technologies (milk house, welfare, agricultural machines) can run in the long term. These important factors can be guaranteed only by an excellent management, which leads the company and by the competent leading workers educated both in vegetable production and in animal husbandry. The interconnection and quality communication between management and production is substantial, only then the direct reaction to the events outside and inside the company is possible. The research clearly shows that the collective farm Struhařov wends its way towards the right direction and its competitiveness rises constantly. Modernization and <b>renovation</b> <b>of</b> the agricultural <b>machinery</b> are in progress. And as a consequence of these, the costs are reduced gradually and the quality and the quantity of the {{milk production}} are rising. For the mentioned reasons the quantity of drawn milk on each milk cow has risen in 5 years-time by ? {{and this is a very}} important efficiency indicator of the company.
