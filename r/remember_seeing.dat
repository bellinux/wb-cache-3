5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot of}} ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E
5|$|River refuses the Doctor's {{offer to}} travel with him, {{returning}} to her Stormcage prison {{in order to keep}} a promise. She kisses the Doctor goodbye, and as the Doctor has never kissed her before she deduces that this will be her last kiss with him. In the TARDIS, Amy appears unable to <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> her picture in the orphanage and says that she told the Doctor, rather than Rory, when she believed she was pregnant, through fears that travelling in the TARDIS might have affected her child's development. As the trio sets off, the Doctor discreetly uses the TARDIS scanner to attempt to determine if Amy is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Altman {{was then}} {{instructed}} to contact Newark Liberty International Airport, a directive he agreed to. However, {{he did not}} contact the tower at Newark. It later transpired that, in acknowledging the instruction to contact Newark, Altman had read back the wrong frequency (127.8MHz instead of 127.85), an error that the controller did not correct. Soon after, a controller at Newark who was concerned about aircraft in the Piper's path contacted the Teterboro controller and asked the him to attempt to re-establish contact. All attempts to contact Altman and change his aircraft's heading were unsuccessful. After the failure to contact Altman, a radar alert about a possible collision occurred in both the Newark and Teterboro towers. However, the two controllers did not <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> or hearing this alert.|$|E

5|$|I am {{excited to}} give my Australian fans the World Premiere of 'Love On Top'! Thank you for the amazing {{response}} to the song at radio. I have worked very hard on this video, this song is special to me and I had an idea for the video based on {{some of my favorite}} male groups. I <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> videos from New Edition, The Jackson 5 and the Temptations, bands I love for their beautiful harmonies, and precise choreography and I always wanted to make a video and be part of a boy group myself. It was so much fun. I put my heart and soul into 'Love On Top' and I hope you love it.|$|E
25|$|Simpson now {{announced}} that his target {{would be a}} run a minute, an ordinary rate maybe in days gone, but a breakneck almost in the sixties, what with slow over-rates and so much accent on defence. Yet Australia, {{give or take a}} few minutes, achieved it, their captain leading the way with the highest opening stand ever, in a partnership with Lawry, for Australia against England: 244. I never <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> better running between wickets than of these two – and found myself comparing them, in fact, with Hobbs and Sutcliffe. With the field constantly changing over as right- and left-hander alternated, England, in much heat, sweated and chased unavailingly.|$|E
500|$|The {{dividing}} wall was removed by parish members on 7March 1995, while others started clearing the truss. The institute called the police, OMON, for help. The following day, more {{conflict with the}} police occurred and several parish members, among them a nun, were injured. Others were arrested, including a priest and a seminarian, but were released the next day. After these events, the Apostolic Administrator, Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz, wrote {{an open letter to}} the Russian President, Boris Yeltsin, on 9March 1995, requesting his intervention: [...] "It seems that persecution of the church was history. Is that the case? I can't <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> a priest arrested, and I can't <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> a nun beaten up." ...|$|E

500|$|The flag {{being so}} very large, mother {{was obliged to}} obtain {{permission}} from the proprietors of Claggetts [...] brewery which was in our neighborhood, to spread it out in their malt house; and I <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> my mother down on the floor, placing the stars: {{after the completion of}} the flag, she superintended the topping of it, having it fastened in the most secure manner to prevent its being torn away by (cannon) balls: the wisdom of her precaution was shown during the engagement: many shots piercing it, but it still remained firm to the staff. Your father (Col. Armistead) declared that no one but the maker of the flag should mend it, and requested that the rents should merely be bound around.|$|E
500|$|Iyall was {{observed}} by Mother Jones {{to be among}} {{a new group of}} female fronted rock bands that displayed a [...] "tough, wry, street-wise, [...] cynical" [...] attitude and sought to redefine {{the role of women in}} rock music. She developed a sizable following for her writing that covered topics like [...] "frustrated desire [...] sexually motivated rage" [...] from a female perspective. Critics praised her lyrics for their [...] "searing imagery", [...] "seething poetics", and [...] "" [...] "My approach was always that I had something to say, I had a point of view," [...] Iyall said, commenting on her outspokeness.

500|$|Despite {{growing up}} in the {{predominantly}} white area of Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire, Dixon's father Melvin would take her to the Notting Hill Carnival in London to allow her to experience some of her Jamaican heritage. The music she would hear influenced her tastes, as she commented: [...] "all the dancehall records I saved up to buy – Shabba Ranks, Buju Banton – I heard them at Notting Hill". When asked during an interview who her favourite songwriter was, Dixon replied: [...] "Lauryn Hill. I love Lauryn Hill because she is not scared to talk about real life. She may say things that are slightly controversial but she gets people thinking and gets people talking". Dixon has also named Neneh Cherry as great influence upon her. Cherry, a mixed race singer, inspired her from an early age, with Dixon saying, [...] "I <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> Neneh Cherry on the TV when I was little and turning to my mum and saying, 'Mummy, she looks like me'".|$|E

500|$|Santiago and Thompson {{shared a}} room {{at the start of the}} second semester. Santiago soon {{introduced}} his new roommate to 1970s punk and the music of David Bowie. He later recalled their time together in college: [...] "Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm. We'd go to shows, I <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> Black Flag and Angst. Initially, I think we just liked each other. I did notice right away that he was playing music... He'd write 'em , and I'd throw my ideas on the guitar." [...] In their second year of college, Thompson traveled to Puerto Rico as an exchange student. After six months there living with a [...] "weird, psycho roommate," [...] Thompson sent Santiago a letter with the words [...] "We gotta do it, now is the time, Joe, we gotta chase our dreams"; Santiago replied, saying [...] "Yes, now's the time." [...] Upon receiving this reply, Thompson decided to return to Amherst to start a rock band with Santiago.|$|E
500|$|After {{the initial}} {{shock of the}} attacks had passed, {{questions}} arose about how the military handled the hijacking and subsequent response with the jets. Some thought that the jets had been purposely kept from flying immediately to New York City. The questions arising from the response time of the jets come from the practice of Cold War era policies which prohibited the immediate response to an emergency like a hijacking. First responder and pilot Daniel Nash {{said that he could}} not recall being told that the North Tower was hit but he did <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> the smoke over [...] away. It is also claimed by conspiracists that the calculations of North American Aerospace Defense Command were incorrect because according to their own calculations, the planes were flying at 24% of their maximum speed. This statement takes into account the time in which the planes were in a holding pattern over military airspace. The jets were also prohibited from going supersonic over land by Federal Aviation Administration rules. These rules are meant to prevent damage to buildings from the shock wave a sonic boom produces.|$|E
500|$|Against the Minnesota Vikings on October 17, Sayers carried 13 {{times for}} 64 {{yards and a}} {{touchdown}}; caught four passes for 63 yards and two touchdowns; and had a 98-yard kickoff return touchdown in the 45–37 Bears victory. He was the last NFL player to score a rushing, receiving, and kickoff return touchdown in the same game until Tyreek Hill accomplished the feat over fifty years later, in 2016. Bears coach Halas lauded Sayers after the game, saying, [...] "I don't ever <b>remember</b> <b>seeing</b> a rookie back who was as good," [...] and deemed his talents equal to former Bears greats Red Grange and George McAfee. [...] "And remember," [...] said Halas, [...] "we used to call George 'One-Play McAfee'." [...] On December 12, Sayers tied Ernie Nevers' and Dub Jones' record for touchdowns in a single game, scoring six in a 61–20 victory over the San Francisco 49ers that was played in muddy conditions at the Chicago Cubs' Wrigley Field. He accounted for 326 yards in the game: 113 rushing, 89 receiving, and 134 on punt returns. Sayers was the consensus choice for NFL Rookie of the Year honors from the AP, UPI, and NEA.|$|E
