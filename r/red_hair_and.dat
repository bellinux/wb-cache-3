She supports charitable organizations that promote mental health, and is involved with the non-profit organization To Write Love on Her Arms to help high-school students of alternate sexual and gender identities overcome insecurities. She was teased as a child for having <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> freckles and now takes a stand against bullying and body shaming.|$|E
5|$|Thor {{closely resembles}} other Indo-European deities {{associated}} with the thunder: the Celtic Taranis, the Baltic Perkūnas, the Slavic Perun, and particularly the Hindu Indra, whose <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> thunderbolt weapon the vajra are obvious parallels. Scholars have compared Indra's slaying of Vritra with Thor's battle with Jörmungandr. Although in the past {{it was suggested that}} Thor was an indigenous sky god or a Viking Age import into Scandinavia, these Indo-European parallels make him generally accepted today as ultimately derived from a Proto-Indo-European deity.|$|E

25|$|The {{characteristic}} of fair skin, <b>red</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> freckling {{is associated with}} high amount of pheomelanin, little amounts of eumelanin. This phenotype {{is caused by a}} loss-of-function mutation in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. However, variations in the MC1R gene sequence only have considerable influence on pigmentation in populations where <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> extremely fair skin is prevalent. The gene variation’s primary effect is to promote eumelanin synthesis at the expense of pheomelanin synthesis, although this contributes to very little variation in skin reflectance between different ethnic groups. Melanocytes from light skin cells cocultured with keratinocytes give rise to a distribution pattern {{characteristic of}} light skin.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{will show}} you,' he replied, {{and as he}} spoke he pulled out three of his <b>red</b> <b>hairs</b> <b>and</b> blew them away, muttering {{something}} the while. In the twinkling of an eye the four hairs changed into four tailors, of whom the first carried a cabbage, the second a pair of scissors, the third a needle, and the fourth an iron. Without waiting for orders, they {{sat down in the}} nest and, crossing their legs comfortably, began to prepare the suit of clothes for Bellah.|$|R
25|$|The {{effects of}} this mixing depend on the types (the alleles) of the gene. If the father has two copies of an allele for <b>red</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> the mother has two copies for brown hair, all their {{children}} get the two alleles that give different instructions, one for <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> one for brown. The hair color of these children depends on how these alleles work together. If one allele dominates the instructions from another, {{it is called the}} dominant allele, and the allele that is overridden is called the recessive allele. In the case of a daughter with alleles for both red and brown hair, brown is dominant and she ends up with brown hair.|$|E

25|$|Turtledove depicts his {{nations as}} being {{analogous}} to real European nations, including {{as far as}} possible actual linguistic relationships. For example, the Derlavaian analogs of the Germanic nations are the Algarvic nations of Algarve, Sibiu, and Lagoas, but to confuse things somewhat, each uses names drawn from a different Romance language. In addition, {{the vast majority of the}} individuals belonging to each language group share the same hair and eye color; Algarvic peoples have <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> green eyes, Kaunian peoples have blond hair and blue eyes, and the Unkerlantic peoples and most others have dark hair and eyes.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, Plisetskaya was a {{different}} kind of ballerina. She spent a very short time in the corps de ballet after graduation and was quickly named a soloist. Her bright <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> striking looks made her a glamorous figure on and off the stage. “She was a remarkably fluid dancer but also a very powerful one”, according to The Oxford Dictionary of Dance. “The robust theatricality and passion she brought to her roles made her an ideal Soviet ballerina.” Her interpretation of The Dying Swan, a short showcase piece made famous by Anna Pavlova, became her calling card. Plisetskaya was known for the height of her jumps, her extremely flexible back, the technical strength of her dancing, and her charisma. She excelled both in adagio and allegro, which is very unusual in dancers.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, late {{at night}} on Tuesday, May 7, a 45-year-old black man named Herbert Thomas was flagged down by a {{hitchhiker}} in Kilgore. The man said that he needed a ride to Henderson because his mother was seriously ill and offered $5. Thomas {{said that he would}} not have given the man a ride but felt like he needed to because the man told such a sad story. When they neared Henderson, the man pulled out a pistol and told Thomas to keep driving or he would kill him like the five people he killed in Texarkana, mentioning Paul Martin and Betty Jo Booker by name. The man told Thomas that he was not done killing and was planning on killing more. He {{said he was going to}} return to Texarkana and kill Martin's father. The suspect apparently did not know that Martin's father was already dead. The man then made Thomas stop in Lufkin and told him to drive back to Kilgore and that if he followed him, he would trail him and kill him. The man stole back the $5 as well as an additional $3. Thomas drove back to Kilgore and reported the incident to the police. Thomas described the man as being 5'8, about 130pounds, approximately 27 or 28 years old, with <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> wore khaki trousers and a GI jacket.|$|E
500|$|In {{a tribute}} {{published}} when Wilkinson's death was announced, the former Conservative MP Thelma Cazalet-Keir summed up her personality: [...] "Ellen Wilkinson {{was as far}} removed from being a bore as {{it is possible for}} any human being to be.

5000|$|For a class presentation, Cartman {{delivers}} a hate speech, {{against what he}} calls [...] "gingers": people with <b>red</b> <b>hair,</b> freckles, <b>and</b> pale skin due to a disease called [...] "Gingervitis". He describes them as being disgusting, inhuman, unable to survive in sunlight, and having no souls.

500|$|A mutant {{capable of}} {{emitting}} incredibly strong ultrasonic screams, sonic blasts, sonic bursts, and sonic waves used {{in various ways}} including {{as a means of}} flight. Jones auditioned without knowing what X-Men character he was up for, saying he auditioned because it was a superhero that fit his biotype: [...] "I've got <b>red</b> <b>hair</b> <b>and</b> freckles, I'm not gonna be Batman, Robin or Spider-Man". The actor also stated that the script defined the character more than the comics, as Banshee went through various reinventions in print. Given Banshee gets involved with MacTaggert in the comics, Jones also tried to [...] "look at her just a little bit differently, you know, when I can." [...] As Jones suffers from acrophobia, using the rig that was to depict Banshee's flight required much preparation time with the stunt team.|$|E
500|$|Elliott and {{his younger}} brother, Pete Elliott, were {{teammates}} at Bloomington High School in 1943 and again at Michigan in 1946 and 1947. [...] After his discharge from the military, Bump joined Pete at Michigan, where Pete played quarterback and Bump was the right halfback for the undefeated 1947 team. [...] Before the 1948 Rose Bowl, one article noted that the two brothers roomed together at Michigan and arranged their programs so that their classes were identical. [...] The article observed: [...] "They look alike, act alike and think alike and in Ann Arbor, Mich., when they {{walk down the street}} any Michigan student can recognize Bump and Pete, the inseparable Elliott Brothers, Wolverines right half and quarterback respectively." [...] The brothers shared the same distinctive golden <b>red</b> <b>hair,</b> <b>and</b> the two were so close that they told a reporter in 1947 that a girl had to receive [...] "the Bumper stamp of approval" [...] before passing Pete's test.|$|E
