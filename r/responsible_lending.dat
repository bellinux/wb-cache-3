25|$|Prior to 2009 {{regulation}} of consumer credit was primarily {{conducted by the}} states and territories. Some states such as New South Wales and Queensland legislated effective annual interest rate caps of 48%. In 2008 the Australian states and territories referred powers of consumer credit to the Commonwealth. In 2009 the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 (Cth) was introduced, which initially treated payday lenders no differently from all other lenders. In 2013 Parliament tightened regulation on the payday lending further introducing the Consumer Credit and Corporations Legislation Amendment (Enhancements) Act 2012 (Cth) which imposed an effective APR cap of 48% for all consumer credit contracts (inclusive of all fees and charges). Payday lenders who provided a loan falling within {{the definition of a}} small amount credit contract (SACC), defined as a contract provided by a non authorised-deposit taking institution for less than $2,000 for a term between 16 days and 1 year, are permitted to charge a 20% establishment fee in addition to monthly (or part thereof) fee of 4% (effective 48% p.a.). Payday lenders who provide a loan falling within the definition of a medium amount credit contract (MACC), defined as a credit contract provided by a non-deposit taking institution for between $2,000–$5,000 may charge a $400 establishment fee in addition to the statutory interest rate cap of 48%. Payday lenders are still required to comply with <b>Responsible</b> <b>lending</b> obligations applying to all creditors. Unlike other jurisdictions Australian payday lenders providing SACC or MACC products are not required to display their fees as an effective annual interest rate percentage.|$|E

40|$|The paper postulates {{that in an}} {{environment}} of continuous financial reforms, the lending rate stickiness in an economy could be changing over the period. The financial reforms (of which deregulation of interest rates formed a major part) during the 1990 s and the early 2000 s and the changing role attributed to different policy rates during the reforms make India an interesting case study. The paper finds evidence of diminishing lending rate stickiness in case of India. During the major part of the study, Indian policymakers used the discount rate for policy signaling. The paper observes that as a result, the long-term rates like the lending rates did not react sufficiently to the changes in the short-term rates (e. g., repo rate) in this period unless the discount rate was also changed. Such behavior changed when policymakers started to use short-term rates like repo rates for policy signaling. Results in this paper suggest that when the impacts are added together, a change of 100 basis points in all policy rates {{towards the end of the}} reference period could change the lending rate in India almost by similar magnitude. These findings help to reconcile some of the contrasting findings on lending rate stickiness in case of India. Among possible factors still <b>responsible</b> for <b>lending</b> rate stickiness, the study identifies inelastic credit demand in India as an important factor. From policymaking perspective, however, it is postulated that as demand for personal and housing loans in India are likely to increase in future due to demographic factor, it is likely that such increase could tend to increase inflexibility in loan rates. ...|$|R

40|$|The ongoing {{empirical}} {{debate about}} whether SRI is associated, if anything, with subpar or surpassing financial performance {{is characterized by a}} somewhat indistinct focus and the infeasibility of tapping the full potential of existing models.

40|$|POLICY QUESTION: “Based {{on results}} of pilot {{programs}} and policies implemented {{in other parts}} of the country, how can New York City/State best support and incentivize <b>responsible</b> small-dollar <b>lending</b> in low-income communities?” RECOMMENDATION: Design a borrower’s card system to collect information about consumers’ borrowing and repayment behaviors, to encourage lenders to extend loans to low-income individuals in need, and to incentivize consumers to take ownership of their own financial behavior. PROBLEM STATEMENT: In many states, the payday lending market has operated to meet the strong consumer demand for short-term small-dollar loans. In the realm of small-dollar lending, the payday lending market provides access for low-income individuals who might be classified as higher risk consumers, likely due to blemished credit histories. Lenders compensate for this higher risk by charging a higher interest rate, which would allow for the possibility that the borrower does not repay the loan. However, though the payday lending market is competitive, significant information asymmetries exist for both the lender and the borrower, which leave lenders unable to discern between high-risk and low-risk consumers, and leave borrowers with an unclear understanding of the terms of the loans and often, with increased amounts of debt. The reliance on payday loans poses significant problems for borrowers, however. Research has shown that consumers often are unable to repay within a single pay period and thus have to roll over their loan for another borrowing period, and accrue another fee. Therefore, for many borrowers, what starts off as a short-term loan turns into long-term payments because of rollover and chronic borrowing patterns. Furthermore, within the industry, only a few states seem to have a standardized database housing information on borrowing and repayment history for payday loan consumers. The lack of a centralized system makes it difficult to keep track of where consumers are originating their loans, how often they are taking out payday loans, and their true ability to repay. More responsible loan programs are characterized by a variety of criteria to ensure access to credit without trapping borrowers in additional debt. These characteristics include annual percentage rate caps, extended loan terms, multiple installment payment plans, proper underwriting of loans based on a borrower’s ability to repay, and financial counseling or a savings component. The tension in designing an alternative program is in balancing consumer need and incentive, market failures in information asymmetries, and business profitability concerns in order to meet the demand for these loans while not encouraging or incentivizing unscrupulous or predatory behavior. CRITERIA: 1) Minimize risk associated with consumers’ ability to repay loans: This criterion aims to reduce the risk associated with a consumer’s ability to repay by either better assessing consumer riskiness or ensuring that whatever consumer risk does exist does not prohibit or limit the potential for the loan to be repaid. 2) Provide incentive for lenders to make loans with a positive expected value: A viable alternative will provide the incentive for lenders to rationally extend a loan by reducing consumer risk, allowing lenders to better examine consumer risk, or by guaranteeing that they will be compensated for the risk associated with the population they are serving. 3) Provide incentive for consumers to improve behavior: A viable alternative should provide a mechanism by which consumers choose to improve their own repayment behavior, in order to ensure lenders receive the return on the loans that they make and continue to provide access to the small-dollar loans. 4) Maximize sustainability of program implementation: Any recommended program design should consider factors of sustainability, such as cost considerations, simplicity of implementation, political pushback, or scalability concerns. ALTERNATIVES: The following alternatives provide plausible program designs for a <b>responsible</b> small-dollar <b>lending</b> program. Each alternative is weighted against the specific criteria identified above. 1) Use a referral process to provide loans to approved low-income and/or high-risk consumers. 2) Design a borrower’s card system to collect information about consumers’ borrowing and repayment behaviors. 3) Fund a loan loss reserve pool to back loans made to low-income and/or high-risk consumers...|$|R

40|$|The {{realization}} {{of a new}} form of education – an interdisciplinary path reading and media education – began in 1999 when {{for the first time this}} expression was used, according to the Ministry of Education (MEN) directive about basis of education programme. However, the advent of the path, which comprised such issues as a book, a library, scientific information or media, was not only the result of activities at the end of 1990 s. Therefore it would be inadequate to assume 1999 as the beginning of education of a given period and so other facts which contributed to its appearance have to be mentioned. Many years before, librarian circles had taken initiatives owing to which legal acts concerning libraries and qualification requirements of school librarians were changed. This, on the other hand, had an impact on librarians' involvement in pupils' preparation for self-education. After the WW II there were no separate rooms which could function as libraries and the modest collection of books constituted one or two bookshelves either in a corridor or in a classroom. Therefore there was no poin in creating a post for a librarian and so one of the teachers – a teacher of Polish language, a teacher of history or another one – was <b>responsible</b> for <b>lending</b> books. In the Decree from 1946 it is mentioned that the library personnel should be well prepared to work with books and readers, though no details referring to librarians' qualifications were stated. Although the library was recognized as an institution whose aim was to prepare teachers and pupils for self-education, didactic activity of librarians in the form of separate lessons was out of question. The librarian was simply seen as a person lending books. The article focuses on the analysis of legislative acts, which described the role of school librarians in education. The analysis already began in 1945, which was briefly justified above. The year 1982 was assumed as the upper time limit – and it was after this year when Work programme of a school library came into force – a document which imposed an obligation on librarians to conduct lessons as part of reading and information preparation. The years to come, starting from 1983, mark a new stage in the history of school library science...|$|R
5000|$|Unferth's {{presence}} in the poem has been a point of much scholarly debate. He is called a Þyle or ðyle - thyle (the word occurs only twice, once in line 1165 with Þ and then in line 1456 with ð, it seems most scholarly articles use the Þ) - a term related to Old Norse thul, a court orater, reciter, or jester. It is noticed that Unferth's brief remarks against Beowulf's youthful risk-taking is [...] "a masterpiece of invective" [...] {{and yet there is}} no reprimand for it, which suggests that it may have been part of Unferth's duties or practices to make a visitor defend his reputation. James L. Rosier, relying on Latin glosses in other Old English writings, interpreted the word to suggest something villainous or scurrilous. This was, however, rejected by Ida M. Hollowell, who theorizes that the Anglo-Saxon audience who immediately know what a thyle was and would even identify Unferth as such by his position {{at the feet of the}} king, and it is someone innocuous or even worthy of respect. She refers to another suggestion for the meaning of thyle- a pagan priest, making Unferth a priest of Woden confronted by a presumably Christian Beowulf. J.D.A. Ogilvy similarly speculates that Unferth's post at the feet of the king demonstrate that he was some sort of entertainer, and that he may have been a landless exile as a result of the misadventures with his kinsmen and given refuge by Hrothgar, as had been done with Ecgtheow (lines 459-472). Unferth only speaks once (an insult aimed at Beowulf), is described as intelligent and a kin-slayer, and is <b>responsible</b> for <b>lending</b> Beowulf his legendary, yet ill-fated sword, Hrunting. Kenneth Sisam argues that readers would be advised not to speculate beyond these basic facts as laid out by the poet. It should be kept in mind that, although the sword provided by Unferth was ineffective against Grendel's mother, we are told that this sword is an ancient treasure, [...] "never had it failed" [...] but although it had sliced through many a helmet, against Grendel's dam [...] "this was the first time that the glorious treasure failed"; Unferth had no reason to foresee this failure, he gave his sword to Beowulf fully expecting it to be entirely successful. Another thought comes from Carroll Rich, who notes that the biblical tale of Cain and Abel is deeply woven into the poem, and as Unferth is a character who is notorious for slaying his own brother, a parallel might exist. Rich observes that “the depiction of Unferth as an envious fratricide makes clear the threat he poses to Beowulf and to a society dependent upon mutual trust.” [...] However, Norman E. Eliason suggests that the mention of Unferth's fratricide, although apparently reiterated in line 1167, is not to be taken seriously but is a mere bit of billingsgate. Eliason's theory is that Unferth is an admirable character, well-intentioned, despite the narrator's suggestions to the contrary.|$|R
