40|$|Background: <b>Raspberry</b> <b>ketone</b> is {{the primary}} aroma {{compound}} found in raspberries and naturally derived <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone</b> is a valuable flavoring agent. The economic incentives {{for the production of}} <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone,</b> combined with the very poor yields from plant tissue, therefore make this compound an excellent target for heterologous production in synthetically engineered microbial strains. Methods: A de novo pathway for the production of <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone</b> was assembled using four heterologous genes, encoding phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia lyase, cinnamate- 4 -hydroxlase, coumarate-CoA ligase and benzalacetone synthase, in an industrial strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Synthetic protein fusions were also explored as a means of increasing yields of the final product. Results: The highest <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone</b> concentration achieved in minimal media exceeded 7. 5 mg/L when strains were fed with 3 mM p-coumaric acid; or 2. 8 mg/L for complete de novo synthesis, both of which utilized a coumarate-CoA ligase, benzalacetone synthase synthetic fusion protein that increased yields over fivefold compared to the native enzymes. In addition, this strain was shown to be able to produce significant amounts of <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone</b> in wine, with a <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone</b> titer of 3. 5 mg/L achieved after aerobic fermentation of Chardonnay juice or 0. 68 mg/L under anaerobic winemaking conditions.

40|$|In tephritid {{fruit flies}} {{of the genus}} Bactrocera Macquart, a group of plant derived {{compounds}} (sensu amplo ‘male lures') enhance the mating success of males that have consumed them. For flies responding to the male lure methyl eugenol, {{this is due to}} the accumulation of chemicals derived from the male lure in the male rectal gland (site of pheromone synthesis) and the subsequent release of an attractive pheromone. Cuelure, <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone</b> and zingerone are a second, related group of male lures to which many Bactrocera species respond. <b>Raspberry</b> <b>ketone</b> and cuelure are both known to accumulate in the rectal gland of males as <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone,</b> but it is not known if the emitted male pheromone is subsequently altered in complexity or is more attractive to females. Using Bactrocera tryoni as our test insect, and cuelure and zingerone as our test chemicals, we assess: (i) lure accumulation in the rectal gland; (ii) if the lures are released exclusively in association with the male pheromone; and (iii) if the pheromone of lure-fed males is more attractive to females than the pheromone of lure-unfed males. As previously documented, we found cuelure was stored in its hydroxyl form of <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone,</b> while zingerone was stored largely in an unaltered state. Small but consistent amounts of <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone</b> and Î²-(4 -hydroxy- 3 -methoxyphenyl) -propionic acid were also detected in zingerone-fed flies. Males released the ingested lures or their analogues, along with endogenous pheromone chemicals, only during the dusk courtship period. More females responded to squashed rectal glands extracted from flies fed on cuelure than to glands from control flies, while more females responded to the pheromone of calling cuelure-fed males than to control males. The response to zingerone treatments in both cases was not different from the control. The results show that male B. tryoni release ingested lures as part of their pheromone blend and, at least for cuelure, this attracts more females...|$|E
40|$|The male {{annihilation}} technique (MAT) is {{a chemical}} control method designed to deplete the males available for mating {{in a population}} and thus break the reproductive cycle. In the New South Wales fruit fly control program, caneite {{has been used as}} a carrier for the lure and pesticide in MAT blocks for many years. In this paper, MAT blocks containing cuelure as an attractant and malathion as a toxicant were manufactured using two methods, namely bag immersion and roller painting, as part of the control program for Queensland fruit fly in New South Wales between September 1998 and June 2000. These blocks were sampled from storage and the field, along with historical blocks in the field deployed before the current study period. Chemical analyses of these three block types were conducted for malathion, cuelure, and <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone</b> (a breakdown product of cuelure). There was significantly more cuelure and malathion in blocks made by the bag method than the roller method and in historical blocks. The bag method resulted in chemical concentrations closer to the desired standards.

40|$|International audienceAIM: To compare {{different}} methods of assessing dietary exposure to flavourings {{in the context}} of a stepwise approach. METHODS: The dietary exposure to four flavourings was determined: <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone,</b> glycyrrhizinic acid, coumarin, and caffeine. When dietary exposure exceeded the safety limits, the need for more detailed assessment using less aggregated data was judged necessary. First, screening methods (Maximized Survey-Derived Daily Intake - MSDI, Single-Portion Exposure Technique - SPET and modified Theoretical Added Maximum Daily Intake - mTAMDI) were applied. Next, individual food consumption data were used for creating models with different levels of detail to identify the foods: a model based on food groups and models based on food items. Three food item models were developed: without improvements of the flavouring descriptor built in the software; with improvements; with use of non-specified flavour descriptors. Consumption data were collected from 121 Dutch adults using a computerized 2 x 24 h-dietary recall (EPIC-Soft) in the European Food Consumption Validation (EFCOVAL) study. RESULTS: Based on results of at least one of the three screening methods, refined assessment was necessary for <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone,</b> glycyrrhizinic acid and caffeine. When applying the food group model, the need of refinement was indicated for the four flavourings. When applying the food item models, only glycyrrhizinic acid and caffeine presented dietary exposure above the safety limits. In the <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone</b> case, dietary exposure increased when improvements in food description were considered. The use of non-specified flavour descriptors hardly changed the results.

40|$|In male tephritid {{fruit flies}} {{of the genus}} Bactrocera, feeding on {{secondary}} plant compounds (sensu lato male lures = methyl eugenol, <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone</b> and zingerone) increases male mating success. Ingested male lures alter the male pheromonal blend, normally making it more attractive to females and this is considered the primary mechanism for the enhanced mating success. However, the male lures <b>raspberry</b> <b>ketone</b> and zingerone are known, across a diverse range of other organisms, {{to be involved in}} increasing energy metabolism. If this also occurs in Bactrocera, then this may represent an additional benefit to males as courtship is metabolically expensive and lure feeding may increase a fly's short-term energy. We tested this hypothesis by performing comparative RNA-seq analysis between zingerone-fed and unfed males of Bactrocera tryoni. We also carried out behavioural assays with zingerone- and cuelure-fed males to test whether they became more active. RNA-seq analysis revealed, in zingerone-fed flies, up-regulation of 3183 genes with homologues transcripts to those known to regulate intermale aggression, pheromone synthesis, mating and accessory gland proteins, along with significant enrichment of several energy metabolic pathways and gene ontology terms. Behavioural assays show significant increases in locomotor activity, weight reduction and successful mating after mounting; all direct/indirect measures of increased activity. These results suggest that feeding on lures leads to complex physiological changes, which result in more competitive males. These results do not negate the pheromone effect, but do strongly suggest that the phytochemical-induced sexual selection is governed by both female preference and male competitive mechanisms...|$|E
