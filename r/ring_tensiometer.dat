40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of particle size on coal-water slurry (CWS) surface tension properties. Two different coal powder samples of different size ranges were obtained through sieving of coal from the Upper Elkhorn Seam. The surfactant (anionic DDBS-soft, dodecylbenzene sulfonic acid) concentration varied from 0 to 1. 0 % in weight while the coal loading remained at 40 % in weight for all the cases. A du Nouy <b>ring</b> <b>tensiometer</b> and a maximum bubble pressure tensiometer measured the static and dynamic surface tensions, respectively. The results show that both static and dynamic surface tensions tend to increase with decreasing coal particle sizes suspended in CWS fuels. Examination of the peak pressure, minimum pressure, surfactant diffusion time, and dead time were also made to correlate these microscopic pressure behavior with the macroscopic dynamic surface tension and to examine {{the accuracy of the}} experiment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Data {{obtained}} from modified cone penetrometer experiments {{were used to}} estimate the hysteretic soil hydraulic properties with a parameter estimation technique which combined a numerical solution of the Richards equation with Marquardt-Levenberg optimization. The modified cone penetrometer was designed to inject water into a soil through a cylindrical screen, measure the infiltration rate with time, and track {{the movement of the}} wetting front using two <b>tensiometer</b> <b>rings</b> positioned above the screen. After reaching relatively stable tensiometer readings during the experiments, the source of water was cut off and pressure head readings measured while water in the soil profile redistributed. Cumulative inflow and pressure head readings for two experiments with different supply pressures were analyzed to obtain estimates of the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions. Analysis of flow responses obtained during the infiltration period, and of those obtained during the combined infiltration and redistribution phases, demonstrated the importance of hysteresis of the soil hydraulic functions. We found that the redistribution phase could not be described accurately when hysteresis was neglected. Hysteresis in the soil hydraulic functions was modeled using a relatively simple empirical model in which wetting scanning curves are scaled from the main wetting curve and drying scanning curves are scaled from the main drying curve. This model was deemed adequate for our examples. Optimization results for various combinations of unknown soil hydraulic parameters were compared to results of standard laboratory and in situ methods. Estimates of the saturated hydraulic conductivity were well within the range of in situ measurements. The estimated main hysteretic loops of the soil water retention curve were for the most part situated between the wetting and drying curves obtained with standard methods. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{amount of}} {{produced}} water during oil production is increasing as oil fields mature. Produced {{water is the}} largest source of pollution in the production phase, and can be treated by a method known as gas flotation. To increase the efficiency of this method, the surface tension between the produced water and air should {{be as high as}} possible. In this study, acid solutions were used as model produced water to investigate how salinity, pH, and the structure and concentration of surfactants influence the surface tension. The acids studied are 4 -heptylbenzoic acid, decanoic acid, and 3 -cyclopentylpropionic acid. Two models are used to investigate the limiting transport mechanisms of short-time-limit adsorption. The measurements were done by means of a Du N&# 246;uy <b>ring</b> <b>tensiometer</b> and a maximum bubble pressure tensiometer. The results indicate that the surface tension of the surfactants decrease when salt is added to the solution. The structure of the surfactant is highly important, as longer chained surfactants have shown to have a higher tendency to adsorb at the interface. The presence of a benzene ring in the hydrocarbon chain has shown to reduce the surface tension. Increasing the pH of a solution of 3 -cyclopentylpropionic has shown to cause an increase in surface tension. The results also indicate that an adsorption barrier is present at concentrations above the CMC, and in surfactant solutions in absence of salt. </p...|$|E
40|$|Surfactant {{flooding}} is {{a well-established}} enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique, but the economic feasibility {{of this method}} {{is a major concern}} due to the substantial misplacement and loss of expensive surfactants to the reservoir rock. However, a new focus on combining the EOR techniques of surfactant flooding and low salinity waterflooding is believed to create beneficial synergies that reduce surfactant retention. In this study, the effect of low salinity water on surfactant adsorption was investigated. The adsorption of the anionic surfactant sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) on Na-kaolinite in brines with different compositions and ionic strengths was studied for this purpose. Several test experiments were conducted in order to establish a good experimental procedure, and the analyses were conducted using both an UV-vis spectrophotometer and a <b>ring</b> <b>tensiometer.</b> Because of the large time consumption of the latter technique, the spectroscopic method was considered as the best approach for this study. The equilibrium adsorption of SDBS on Na-kaolinite was studied by static methods, and the results were presented as adsorption isotherms, which indicated increasing SDBS adsorption with ionic strength and when adding divalent ions. The shapes of the adsorption isotherms of SDBS in monovalent brine were unexpected. Both maxima and minima were observed, and there was not an adsorption plateau, but an indication of increased adsorption after the critical micelle concentration (CMC). Adsorption isotherms with a characteristic S-shape were obtained for studies in divalent brine, and it was suspected that the adsorption maximum in these isotherms was due to the formation of precipitate when SDBS interacted with divalent ions. The SDBS adsorption isotherms were analysed by the Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models. The Freundlich model described the experimental data best, and SDBS systems with high salinity or divalent ions had the best fit to the theoretical model...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this work was to {{understand}} the driving mechanisms by which the bacterium Rhodococcus sp. 094 increases oil recovery. The reason for only using this species was to thorougly investigate different aspects of it, to be able to answer as many questions as possible so that in the end {{it would be possible to}} confidently understand which mechanisms are responsible for enhanced oil recovery with this bacterium. From the lessons learned on this work one could more efficiently design a research project on other bacteria to investigate their driving mechanisms. A deep understanding of how any EOR method works is necessary in order to select the right method, and to correctly design its application, and in the case of MEOR there is a vast number of possibilities and variabilities. The experimental work made for this project has been comprehensive, with more than 100 core flooding experiments being carried out, 97 of which have been successful and have formed the main body of this research. Interfacial Tension measurements were made with a <b>ring</b> <b>tensiometer</b> and a goniometer, and contact angles have been measured by goniometry. Wettability was also measured by Amott test, and micromodel floodings were carried out. The potential of MEOR as a secondary drainage method has been tested against its use as a tertiary method, and two variants of the bacteria, a surfactant producing variant (SPB) and a non-surfactant producing variant (NSPB) were compared. How wettability of the rock affects the effectiveness of the MEOR process has also been studied, as well as the effect of the water salinity. Finally the particle like behavior of the bacteria was tested, to see whether the additional recovery effect is due to sweep efficiency improvement alone, caused by accumulation of particles. The experimental work carried out throughout the duration of this project has been presented as papers, and this are reproduced in the chronological order in which they were published. Comments have been added where the point of view of the author has varied at a later point as results from more experiments were obtained. From the initial hypothesis of the mechanisms being: interfacial tension reduction, wettability change and sweep efficiency improvement, it has now been established how the most important mechanism is sweep efficieny improvement, with interfacial tension reduction playing a smaller role, and wettability change not likely contributing significantly. Some insight has also been gained as to how MEOR is more complex than the traditional description of its main mechanisms, given that the bacteria, as living beings affect the recovery in a way in which particles or chemicals cannot.

40|$|Fabrication, {{characterization}} {{and application}} of electrospun polymer composite based colorimetric probes are presented in this thesis. The {{first part of the}} thesis involved the development of a protocol for in situ reduction of gold trication (Au³+) into metallic gold atoms with sodium borohydride. The prepared PS-Au NPs showed an SPR band at 542 nm. Furthermore the absorbance of the colloidal Au NPs in polystyrene exhibited a good linear correlation (r 2 = 0. 9934) to E 2 concentration in the range 5 to 50 ppb. The lowest naked eye detection limit was found to be 0. 5 ppb and could further be easily monitored by UV-vis spectrophotometer. Upon interaction with E 2 Au NPs aggregated to give nanoparticle clusters, confirmed through TEM analysis. Different concentrations of Au NPs were found to {{have a significant effect on}} the conductivity of the PS-Au NPs solution. At low concentrations of Au NPs (0. 002, 0. 015 and 0. 025 % w/v) PS-Au NPs solution could be electrospun without clogging. The FE-SEM images showed a non-beaded morphology of PS-Au NPs composite fibers. Upon interaction of the colorimetric probe strips with various E 2 concentrations it was observed that with increasing E 2 concentrations (50 ng/ml to 1000 µg/ml) the colour of the probe changed gradually from white to shades of pink and eventually to shades of blue at higher E 2 concentrations. The visible cut-off concentration was 100 ng/ml. The second component of the thesis focussed on the development of diazonium dye-nylon 6 colorimetric probe for aspartate aminotransferase. At optimal pH 7. 4 the enzyme was stable, highly active and catalyzed a reaction that was susceptible to detailed kinetic analysis by continuous optical methods. The KM values for L-aspartate, a- ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate were 2. 60, 0. 59 and 0. 066 mM, respectively. On the basis of these KM values the solid-state colorimetric probe was developed. A colour change occurred when an electrospun dye-N 6 probes were exposed to visibly detectable concentrations of oxaloacetate, an AST-catalyzed reaction product. While monitoring AST activity at 530 run, a linear relation was obtained between oxaloacetate concentrations ranging from 0. 4 - 7. 4 µg/ml. Naked eye detection limit of 2. 4 µg/ml oxalaoacetate equivalence of 10 times the normal AST activity was attained. The colorimetric probe was in addition, tested against co-substrates aspartate, ketoglutarate and a variety of other compounds such as alanine, pryruvate, as well as glutamic, malaic and succinic acids known to interfere with AST activity. Each compound elicited a distinct and unambiguous colour change upon interaction with the colorimetric probe. Further X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), duNouy <b>ring</b> <b>tensiometer,</b> Brunauer- Emmett- Teller (BET) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS/EDX) characterization confirmed composition and stability of the colorimetric probes. Colorimetric probes developed in this thesis are relatively cost effective, simple and "rugged" for measurement of analytes with visual detection without sample pretreatment in matrices, such as plasma and dairy effluents. The probes warrant further investigation as they have shown potential and offer a promising solid-state platform for both clinical diagnostics and environmental monitoring...|$|E
