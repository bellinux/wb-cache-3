However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium, and may have rotated faster {{at some point in}} the recent past (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that the density of the core is low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyse the impact of {{attrition}} rates in hospitality industry. The study majorly focuses on the increasing employee turnover, its causes and impact. It looks at various methods to improve employee retention in an organisation. Various human resource theories are used to analyse the employee behaviour in an organisation. Literature review gives a background study to this research. It gives information about the previous study that had been done on employee turnover in hospitality industry. This chapter highlights causes and impact of employee turnover, and employee retention as a measure. In research methodology, <b>researcher</b> <b>has</b> cited all the methods and techniques used for this study. <b>Researcher</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> given her choice of research methods and its justification. In the next chapter findings and analysis are provided by using appropriate research methods. Analysis is done using semi-structured interviews, classic HR theories and case study.

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades Process-oriented Descriptive Translation Studies has {{developed}} noticeably. Think-aloud protocols (TAPs), as a verbal report, are still the most applied empirical method to investigate the complex and conscious processes of translator’s mind during translating. This article deals with the cognitive process of professional translators’ problem-solving to translate a neologism from English source text into Persian by using TAPs. Likewise, the <b>researcher</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> used the means of video recording to observe the other behaviors of participants during the problem solving. The results indicate that the professional translators do not use one single way of performing a translation task and the complexity of the process of problem-solving (neologisms translation) depends on the translation competence of translators. Finally, the <b>researcher</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> presented a cognitive model for the translation process of neologisms in ideal situations. As the translation universals are cognitive phenomena, the cognitive model presented here can be a pattern for trainee translators in education to visualize the natural process of neologism translation...|$|R

The study majorly focuses on the research on international students’ perspectives. It looks at various researches done by other authors and researchers in this sector. This research also recommends the strategy model to be used by the institutions for promoting the education worldwide. According to the study, UK education is expanding at an explosive rate all over the world. International students get attracted towards the various marketing strategies followed by the UK universities through various government bodies and also through a number of educational agents in the home country. Literature Review gives a background study to this research. It gives information about the previous study that had been done on marketing education internationally. This chapter highlights various disciplines like marketing, international marketing, decision-making process of international students etc. It also explains the models used in marketing mix, product level model.
