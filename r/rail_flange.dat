40|$|Rail {{and rail}} wheel flange wear {{on the rail}} track {{has been a problem}} of {{attention}} for the last 30 years. The problems arise in curves and depend on increased traffic volume, heavier axle load and also higher speed. Axle loads of 22, 5 - 25 ton is common nowadays and the trend is towards heavier axle loads where the next step is 30 - 35 ton. Flange wear includes both wheel and rail flanges and is therefore a problem for the operating company as well as the infrastructure owner. The flange wear depend mainly on the number of passed axles, type of traffic, speed and curve radius but also the axle load contributes. Flange lubrication on high rail is a well known way to reduce wear since the middle of 70 th and a number of techniques to lubricate the <b>rail</b> <b>flange</b> are developed as grease, aerosol of oil and dry stick with solid lubricants. The trackside lubricator can not apply the grease on the <b>rail</b> <b>flange</b> when the climate is during the winter. The infrastructure owner in Sweden was interested {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the track side lubricator. The investment in trackside lubricators over 20 years was about 75 Mkr (7, 6 USD) and also an additional yearly costs to operate 3000 apparatuses. The work to evaluate effectiveness of the lubrication started 1997 there one of the important matter concern the possibility to use environmentally adapted lubricants without hazard the rail. This licentiate thesis concern effectiveness of trackside lubricators to reduce wear in sharp railroad curves. Also the environmentally aspects have been considered and therefore natural esters synthetic esters and additives suited for those kind of lubricants have been evaluated. The research proved that environmentally adapted lubricants could lubricate as good as earlier used greases. Some amount of metal removal is probably healthy for this kind of application. Lubricants as synthetic esters can be designed get those qualities. It was also found significant difference between the seasons concerning flange wear.

40|$|In {{torsion-box}} {{design of}} twin girder overhead cranes, the bridge rail {{on which the}} lifting unit runs is positioned eccentrically on the girder, directly above one of the web plates. This web is subjected to in-plane patch loading produced by the spread of a wheel load through the overlying <b>rail</b> and <b>flange.</b> This study concerns the load carrying capacity of plate box-girder web panels subjected to a wheel load at the midspan of the panel. Distribution of a wheel load through a <b>rail</b> and <b>flange</b> is investigated from recordings made of in-plane vertical stress distribution profiles along the upper edge of a web panel of a short-span model box-girder. The girder was loaded through various interfaces above the web by a wheel load. A simple method is proposed for relating a distributed wheel load to an equivalent uniform patch load. Methods for estimating distributed wheel loading lengths are investigated. It is shown that crane web panels are generally subjected to patch loads of short length, occupying less than one-quarter of the panel length. A computer analysis is presented to determine elastic buckling coeffic-ients for flat rectangular plates subjected to a uniform in-plane patch load centrally disposed on one edge and supported by shear stresses on the adjacent edges. Patch loads of various lengths are considered over a range of plate aspect ratios for plates with various combinations of simply supported and clamped edges. Also considered are some non-uniformly distributed patch loads modelling approximately a distributed wheel load. For {{the large majority of}} geometries considered, it is the support condition along the loaded edge which has greatest influence on the buckling load. Correlation with buckling loads estimated from experimental measurements on a model crane girder web panel indicated that an assumption of simply supported panel edges is over-conservative and that it is probably more representative to consider the edges attached to the flanges as clamped. Ultimate load carrying capacity is considered. A plastic mechanism analysis originally presented by Roberts and Rockey is studied and a modified form derived which reveals the transition region from collapse initiated by direct web yielding for girders with stocky webs to failure by a mechanism of out-of-plane web deformation for girders with slender webs. Certain approximations in the original analysis are shown to involve the omission of terms which can contribute significantly to the plastic work expression. Inclusion of these terms, however, whilst offering potential refinement, increases considerably the complexity of the analysis. Results are presented of a series of collapse tests conducted on short-span model box-girders subjected to a wheel load above one of the webs. The effect on the failure load of rail size, web thickness, panel aspect ratio, and longitudinal web stiffening is investigated. Snap buckling was exhibited by several of the test web panels. From the results, a simple expression is developed for predicting collapse loads of plate girders subjected to narrow patch loads. The main findings of the work are used as a basis for a series of recommendations to aid the structural designer in taking account of patch loading on slender web panels...|$|R

50|$|One of the {{earliest}} companies {{to take advantage of}} mineral resources around Ripley was the Butterley Company. The company was formed in 1790 by Benjamin Outram and Francis Beresford.

Outram developed the L shaped <b>flange</b> <b>rail</b> and Jessop engineered the cast iron fish belly rail. The Little Eaton Gangway project was one of the engineering feats they completed. The engineering part of the company closed and the site of the Butterley Company was demolished in 2010.

Over the last 200 years the companies have been a steelworks, coal mining, quarrying, railway, foundry, brickworks. One of the early, and most well-known, examples of the work of the company includes the arched roof of St. Pancras railway station in London, recently restored as an international rail terminal.

40|$|Wheel/rail {{contact is}} {{critical}} to the successful operation of a railway network. Contact occurs at the wheel tread/rail head and wheel flange/rail gauge corner. Contact conditions are more severe in the latter, which occurs mainly at curves. The contact is small and supports large loads; therefore, high contact stresses are generated. These, combined with the slip in the contact, are primarily responsible for driving the processes that lead to wheel and rail damage, whether by deformation, wear or a fatigue process. Multi-body dynamics software is useful for predicting the wheel/rail contact characteristics; however, {{there is a shortage of}} experimental tools available. In this study, the feasibility of an approach based on an ultrasonic sensor mounted on the wheel is investigated. The sensor emits an ultrasonic pulse which is designed to impinge on the wheel flange. If there is no contact the pulse is fully reflected back at the flange and picked up by the same sensor. If flange contact takes place, a proportion of the pulse amplitude will be transmitted into the rail. The signal reflected back to the sensor is therefore reduced. The amount by which this signal reduces indicates how much flange contact has occurred. This work had two aspects. First, a standard ultrasonic ray-tracing software package was used to establish what it is possible to measure with sensors mounted in the wheel and to determine the best location and orientation. The second aspect was an experimental study to determine whether such measurements are feasible. Test specimens were cut from sections of wheel and rail, and a 2 [*]MHz ultrasonic contact transducer was bonded onto the wheel in a position best suited to detect the flange contact. The specimens were pressed together in a bi-axial loading frame to generate differing degrees of <b>rail</b> head and <b>flange</b> contact. The reflected signal was monitored as the normal and lateral loads were varied. It proved possible not only to detect the onset of flanging, but also to record a signal that varied monotonically with both normal and lateral applied load.

The technology, while not currently suitable for full field implementation could be very useful in laboratory studies on, for example, a full-scale wheel/rail rig...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Instıtute of Science and Technology, 2015 Raylı sistemlerin çıkış noktası oldukça eskiye dayanmaktadır. Çok eski tarihlerde insanların ağır yüklerin taşınmasında bugünkü raylı sistemlere benzer şekilde taşımacılık yaptığı bilinmektedir. Günümüze gelinceye kadar raylı sistemde önemli gelişme sağlanmıştır. Motorlu araçların ortaya çıkışı ile birlikte sanayileşme ve hızlı nüfus artışı raylı sistemlere olan ihtiyacı gün geçtikçe artırmış ve modern demiryolları kurulmuştur. Bugün maglev trenlerle 500 km/h hızın üstüne çıkılmış, ancak maglev trenler henüz yaygınlaşmamıştır. Bilinen en yüksek hızda (max. 430 km/sa) işletme yapan tek maglev tren hattı Çin’de yolcu taşımasında kullanılmaktadır. Klasik demiryolu araçlarının hızı ise bugün 300 km/h’in üstüne çıkmış ve yolcu taşımacılığında önemli bir paya sahip olmuştur. Bütün bu gelişmeler demiryollarının insan hayatındaki yerini ve önemini artırmaktadır. Artan talebin karşılanmasına yönelik birçok çalışma yapılmış ve bunun soncunda çeşitli rijit üstyapı tipleri ortaya çıkmıştır. Bunların neticesinde hem insan hayatının güvenliği hem de uzun süre bozulmadan stabilitesini koruması ve uygun maliyetli olabilmesi açısından demiryolu üstyapı hesaplamaları önem kazanmıştır.   Bu çalışmamızda 2. bölümde balastsız üstyapının avantajları anlatılmış ve dünyada kullanılan rijit üstyapı tipleri tanıtılmış ve üstyapı enkesitleri şekillerle açılanmıştır. 3. bölümde yerinde dökme üstyapıyı oluşturan raylar, bağlantı elemanları, traversler ve betonarme plaklar incelenmiş ve bu elemanlara ait dünyada kullanılan türler sınıflandırılarak anlatılmış ve teknik özellikleri, olumlu ve olumsuz yönleri hakkında bilgiler verilmiştir. 4. bölümde ise LVT üstyapısı ve bileşenleri daha detaylı bir şekilde açıklanarak kullanıdığı hat kısaca tanıtılmış, LVT sistemin seçilmesinde öne çıkan titreşim ve gürültü önlemlerine değinilmiştir. 5. bölümde; üstyapı boyutlandırılmasında kullanılan parametreler ve hesaplamaları anlatılmış,  rijit üstyapı hesaplamasına örnek olarak LVT tipi üstyapının farklı araç işletim durumları için statik analizi yapılmış ve boyutlandırılması gerçekleştirilmiştir.

The {{origin of}} the railway systems is {{considerably}} old. In very old times, {{it is known that}} people were carrying heavy freights by the similar way in concept to railway transportation. From history to present day, there have been significant improvements in the rail system. With the industrial revolution and the appearance of motor vehicles together with the rapid population growth, the need of railway transportation gradually increased and that demands resulted in modern railway establishment. Today, maglev trains have been exceeded 500 km/h speed but this type of railway transportation is not in public use yet. Only one line of maglev train in China known in service carrying passengers with high-speed (maximum velocity is 430 km/h).   On the other hand, conventional rapid trains recently have reached over 300 km/h velocity. These rapid trains nowadays have significant share of transportation in the world. Thanks to all these developments, the railway transportation has been taking more important place in human life. To fulfill the increased demands, many types of railway systems have been implementing and more passengers have been benefiting from railway transportation day by day. Therefore, to provide a secure and comfortable transportation system concurrently with favorable cost, railway track design becomes more prominent. In this study, 2 nd chapter explains conventional railway and the layers of the railway track by giving technical properties. The layers that form the track superstructure are the formation, sub-ballast, ballast, geotextile, frost protection layer. Since the topic of this study is a ballastless track design, sub-ballast and ballast layers are not explained here. Add to this, brief information about sub-base soil condition is given. Besides, according to UIC Code, formation layer thickness has been shown by table depending on the different types of soil quality class.   Types of slab track systems used worldwide and their cross-section properties are also briefly shown together with figures of cross section properties. Some of these balastless tracks have been examined more detailed and their advantages are introduced in general. Lots of different balasstless track systems have been classified in a table and the advantages of ballastless track systems are given in general. In the 3 rd chapter, the components of the cast in-situ slab track system which are rail, fasteners, sleepers and concrete plate or plinth beams are examined and the components of these in worldwide use are classified and introduced. Rail types are described as <b>flange</b> <b>rail,</b> double headed rail and Vignol rail. Technical properties of the rail types briefly given and the specification, features that they should have and information about pros and cons of these elements explained. Rail fasteners systems are described as two types, rigid system fasteners and elastic system fasteners. The features of these types of fasteners are shown together with figures. After that sleepers defined under the titles of wooden, steel, concrete and plastic sleepers. Some types of the sleepers that tried and currently being used in the world explained. In concrete sleeper title, post-stressed and pre-stressed concrete sleepers have been described. In this chapter we also give some information about plinth concrete beam and explain the measures must be taken during its construction stage briefly. In the 4 th chapter, a type of slab track systems LVT has been chosen and explained in more detail. Here we also mentioned about ground born noise and vibration mitigation which has an inspiration to choosing LVT slab track. Some measures that should be taken for special buildings such as hospital and theater are given. Besides this, LVT systems features and advantages are explained. In 5 th chapter, design of railway superstructure with an example of LVT system has been explained. At first, we explain how the wheel loads are transferred from top (rail) to sub-base showing modeling of railway superstructure in figure. Slab track modeling has springs between the layers that form the superstructure. From bottom to top, first springs take place under the rigid concrete slab which represents the soil elasticity. Since we examined LVT system here, second spring is between rigid slab and LVT concrete block so called block pad as explained in chapter 4 and the third spring for modeling takes place under the rail representing rail pad stiffness. This type of modeling can also be seen in figure.   In chapter 5 we also introduce the forces which effect railway superstructure. Forces studied under the titles of vertical forces, horizontal forces, temperature stresses and other forces and technical information about these forces are given. Vertical forces investigated under two titles, static and dynamic vertical forces. As for the horizontal forces, they are shown under two titles either as the forces acting parallel to longitudinally direction of railway superstructure and forces acting perpendicular direction to the railway. In temperature stresses section, the calculation of forces emanating from temperature has been given by equation depending on unit length change and temperature change. Railway roadway design is performed assuming that railway is a beam laid on elastic platform, and therefore, determination of soil type and coefficient of soil stiffness or soil spring value is important. Here in chapter 5, we give information about calculation of coefficient of soil stiffness in light of Winkler and Zimmermann’s equations. For obtain one soil coefficient of stiffness when multi-layer case is subject, Eisenmann’s equivalent layers theory has been used and introduced by the help of a figure and the calculation of this method has been explained. Another coefficient used for superstructure static analyses is dynamic impact factor. Today many types of calculation method developed for taking into consideration of the impact of dynamic forces acting on railway. In this study we used Eisenmann’s equations for the speed until 200 km/h.   5 th chapter also explain the analyses and concrete slab design calculation for LVT system under different vehicle loads. The loads chosen here have been taken from UIC and EN 1991 standards. For freight train maximum speed taken as 100 km/h. As for the passenger train and high-speed train maximum speed taken as 120 km/h and 250 km/h respectively. Load Model 71 from UIC is used for freight train. For passenger and high speed train, type- 2 and type- 3 load model from EN 1991 has been used. It should be kept in mind that there is much more different type of load models depending on vehicle style. For analysis, FEA base computer program SAP 2000 has been preferred. This program allows engineers to model almost every type of structure realistically. To model LVT system in the program, modeling technique of which illustration is given by figure in chapter 5 has been used. Rail pad which take place under the rails at joints and rubber boot and LVT block pad represented by springs. Here LVT concrete block pad and the rubber boot which contains the block thought together and their stiffness combined calculating an equivalent spring coefficient.   Soil condition considered as good and class of the subbase soil taken as QS 3 according to soil classification of UIC Code. In the model soil represented with springs either. Slab area that considered here a bearing beam laid on elastic platform divided into small finite elements for analysis. The analysis results are shown in figures as contours diagram and concrete design has been performed using the longitudinally and transverse moment values. There might be lots of soil types and geometrical properties on the route of railway track. Thus, quite a lot different conditions may be needed to take into account. In this study the chosen part is regarded as an alignment and calculation is performed accordingly. In final section we explained our assessments and thoughts about the results of the study.
