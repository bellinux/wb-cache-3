They head to the location and find the woman, but Gordon uses a roller door to separate the brothers. The woman is revealed to be a vampire turned by Gordon, and Dean is forced to shoot her with the Colt—a mystical gun capable of killing anything. He then attempts to help Sam, but Gordon prepares to bite him. Sam prevents this and garrotes Gordon with a <b>razor</b> <b>wire,</b> decapitating the vampire. Sam and Dean later stop {{on the side of the}} road to check a rattling noise made by the Impala. Sam is confused when Dean starts explaining the engine's problem. Dean, however, reasons that Sam should know how to fix the car when his remaining time runs out, and also notes that, as his older brother, he should be showing him the ropes.|$|E

Army engineers were deployed, and the remaining grounds were surrounded with <b>razor</b> <b>wire</b> and shipping container barricades to decrease the chances of another pitch invasion. At Eden Park, an emergency escape route was constructed from the visitors' changing rooms for use if the stadium was overrun by protestors. Crowds of anti-tour protestors stood outside as the police were overwhelmed but the hundreds of police still managed to prevent the protestors from entering the stadium.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} is {{situated at the}} back of the Saw Plaza. The exterior queue line consists of mock <b>razor</b> <b>wire</b> fences and various large torture implements rusting on the ground (most of which come from the films). Walkie talkie announcements are heard from policemen inside the building, often sounding as if they are panicking. Loud ambient music is played throughout the area. The queue travels around the back of the warehouse and then into the building itself. Inside, riders walk through a dimly lit corridor, with four shotguns hanging from the ceiling. The guns 'fire' every few minutes to give a jump effect. The corridor leads up some stairs past a cage with a trap (the Rack from Saw III) seen in it. On special occasions, live actors are placed in this cage and act as Jigsaw's victims. Travelling up the stairs, Billy the Puppet can be seen and heard on TV monitors up the stairs to the station. Above the queue, a body is seen tangled in barbed wire (referencing the first Saw), before the queue goes into the station. In here, mannequin parts are fixed in various small devices or hanging from the walls, and misted windows flash on the wall opposite the queue.|$|E

The government decided {{to crack down on}} the protesters. Police used tear gas but many bullets were fired at the protesters. Many protesters got seriously wounded; some even lost legs, causing over a hundred injuries. One additional PAD leader was killed, claimed by the police, when the bomb in his car went off in front of the headquarters of the Chart Thai Party, a member of the government coalition. Several protesters lost their hands and legs, although it was not clear whether these injuries were caused by tear gas rounds or the ping-pong grenades. Pornthip Rojanasunand, Director of the Central Institute of Forensic Science, claimed that the loss of one particular PAD member's leg could not have been the result of tear gas usage, but came from a more powerful explosion. After viewing photographs of Angkhana Radappanyawut's injuries, Pornthip Rojanasunand suggested unequivocally that the death was caused by the explosion of a tear gas canister. She also stated that there was no need to conduct further investigations into the death and injuries of protesters because it became clear that they were caused by weapons of police. Investigations took place while charges against the police and government were filed by many protesters.|$|E

Also in that year, veterans of a Twyford Down protest threatened a new campaign of direct action in response to 200 new road-building proposals in the government's recently unveiled ten-year transport plan. Rebecca Lush Blum went on to found Road Block in 2005, which {{became part of the}} Campaign for Better Transport (UK) in 2007.

5000|$|Regarding immigration, UPyD wish to {{transfer}} immigration policy to the European Union as an exclusive competence because {{it affects the}} whole of Europe. Therefore, the party asks the European Commission {{for the inclusion of}} Ceuta and Melilla in the European customs area as full-fledged territories and, hence, external borders of the European Union. UPyD states that controlled immigration is good and necessary for Europe because of its demographic ageing and advocates a common immigration policy with strict respect for international law and human rights that entails a European action protocol to contain illegal immigration. On the one hand, the magenta party supports greater immigration control by arguing that Ceuta's and Melilla's Spanish border fences must be protected. UPyD believes that the Civil Guard should stop illegal immigrants and legally repatriate them to their country of origin or return them to the country which they entered from without violating their human rights, thereby banning deterrents like firing rubber bullets and the use of <b>razor</b> <b>wires.</b> On the other hand, the party stands up for giving asylum and humanitarian protection to displaced people outside their countries because of armed conflicts, without discriminating against Muslim refugees. Likewise, UPyD is favourable to earmark financial resources for promoting democracy in countries where there is no democracy and even to intervene militarily if financial resources are insufficient [...] "to defend and protect human rights and thus no one has to leave those countries".|$|R

A separation buffer consisted of two 12 ft perimeter security fences topped with coiled stainless steel <b>razor</b> ribbon <b>wire</b> and a planting berm fencing with deciduous and evergreen trees separated Mound from the surrounding area, {{in order to keep}} prisoners in the prison and to prevent intruders from entering the facility. Other security features included four gun towers, an electronic detection system, and an armed vehicle on patrol 24 hours per day.|$|R

The medical hooks, rusting scissors, and <b>razor</b> sharp high-tension <b>wires</b> all imply a castration theme, accentuated not just by the sadistic mechanical trap that Gilgamesh sets {{but also by the}} sequence in which he places two eggs on a slicing wicket, positioning them where his own testicles should be. Such brutal and sexually violent imagery would reoccur in the brothers’ other films, most notably in Street of Crocodiles, where organic materials are organized into representations of male genitals then pierced with tailor’s pins.|$|R
500|$|According to Marc and Claire Headley, two Scientologists {{who left}} the Church in 2005, {{residents}} at the base {{are not permitted to}} leave without the permission of a supervisor and have to work at least 16 hours a day, from 8 am to past midnight, with shorter hours on Sundays and little time for socialising. Communications with the outside world are effectively cut off; cellphones and Internet access are generally banned, mail is censored and passports are kept in a locked filing cabinet. The perimeter of the base is closely guarded around the clock. It is ringed with high fences that are topped with spikes and <b>razor</b> <b>wire</b> and monitored by inward-facing motion sensors to detect anyone trying to climb out of the compound. The Tampa Bay Times reported that dozens of workers tried to escape from the base– some of them repeatedly– but were caught and returned by Sea Org [...] "pursuit teams".

500|$|The first {{obstacle}} {{facing the}} brigade was [...] "the berm", a 10-kilometer-deep defensive obstacle complex that spanned Iraq's border with Kuwait. The berm consisted of large tank ditches, berms of dirt, electrified fencing, and <b>razor</b> <b>wire.</b> It {{was decided that}} the 3rd Infantry Division's Brigade Combat Teams would breach this berm in eight locations and move through. The 130th Engineer brigade analyzed the berms and provided a layout of them to coalition forces. The 130th Engineer Brigade then conducted the actual breaches in late March, using armored combat earthmovers to build roads for tracked vehicles, while armored vehicle-launched bridges set up for wheeled vehicles. The 130th worked with Kuwati engineers to breach the berm in 12 places, and the 3rd Infantry Division's Brigade Combat Teams moved though, starting the Iraq War. After combat forces moved through, the brigade and the Kuwatis then sealed off ten of these breaches to prevent Iraqi forces from using then, leaving two open for US forces that followed from the 82nd and 101st.|$|E
500|$|To lend {{a strong}} air of realism to Gordon's death, {{the scene was}} created by {{combining}} various special effects during filming with post-production visual effects. Plastic <b>razor</b> <b>wire</b> with blood tubing aided in the initial phases of the decapitation; it would slightly sink into Brown's neck as pressure was applied, forcing out the fake blood. For the aftermath, Brown laid down on the floor, and the visual effects department removed his head from the shot and recreated it as a three-dimensional model. The department decided to [...] "push {{it a little bit}} farther" [...] by having the head rocking into place and the mouth twitching, but Standards and Practices found it too graphic and forced them to remove the motion. Established in the first-season episode [...] "Dead Man's Blood" [...] were the shark-like teeth of vampires, and the design has been subtly improved with each vampire episode. Though the special effects makeup department used molds of the actors' mouths to create the fanged acrylic dentures, McNab noted that {{it was very difficult to}} speak while wearing them. Blood-like makeup around the actors' mouths helped to round out the vampiric visages.|$|E

Kira also convinced Sasame, who was intoxicated at the time, to eat the fingers off of both of his hands. To take his revenge, Sasame rents the apartment just above Kira's and booby traps Kira's while he's out, filling the bathroom slippers with thumbtacks, putting needles in the towel, adding a <b>razor</b> sharp <b>wire</b> to the bathroom chain, placing a woman under his Stand's thrall in the room, taking several compromising photos to suggest Kira is a pervert, and filling the balcony with venomous snakes, all a means to take control of Kira, only to have Josuke fall into the trap instead.

Often people scare to use lifts, narrow walkways, rear staircases, darken basements, high roof tops or largely open public places. In such places they fear being murdered, abused, abducted, or stabbed. The investigation primarily measures the ‘required sense of safety’ in an urban public realm with respect to the architectural design principals, spatial and space related aspects. The four case studies of the research will be focused on ‘public buildings’ filling the ‘research gap’ within the field of study existed between two main levels of ‘city fabric’ and ‘individual dwelling’. The research outcome reveals the ‘controlling power’ of ‘fear in space’ that has influenced user psychology and behavior accordingly, including 21 integrated architectural aspects behind the cause. Concurrently, the investigation emphasizes possible design interventions to diminish such negative impressions composing ‘positive motives’ which supports public cohesiveness, interaction and free movements in built-sphere in which architectural design becomes a ‘tool’ in order to manipulate ‘sense of safety’...|$|R

The pit is only large enough for a prisoner to walk 10 steps in a straight line, or 31 steps in a circle. Telecommunication with the outside world is forbidden, and food is hand-delivered by correction officers. However, inmates sent here from other prisons can potentially be allowed to eat in a shared dining room.
