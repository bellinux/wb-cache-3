40|$|Online e-health {{systems are}} being {{proposed}} and developed at an ever increasing rate. However, the progress {{relies on the}} interoperability of local healthcare software, and is often hampered by ad hoc methods leading to closed systems with a multitude of protocols, terminologies, and design approaches. AOSE seems intuitively a good approach to developing more open systems. While agent-based e-health systems have been developed, the general hypothesis of the suitability of AOSE has not been evaluated. In this paper, we test that hypothesis, including {{a case study of}} applying a <b>regulated</b> <b>agent</b> methodology to a particular real-world e-health system, and present an analysis of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} AOSE for e-healt...|$|E
40|$|We {{focus on}} {{the role played by}} waste policy and {{enforcement}} in determining waste related corruption. We develop a simple model in which an economic agent chooses the level of illegal disposal of its waste. The polluting agent can be detected by the local police authority. In the event of discovery of illegal waste disposal, the local administration may decide to report the agent's illegal activity (implying that the agent itself will have to pay a unit fine on such activity), or to protect the polluting agent in exchange for a bribe. The official in charge is herself subject to enforcement from the central government. By varying the exogenous enforcement and waste tax levels, we derive several interesting trade-offs among the goals of reducing corruption, financing legal disposal costs and illegal dumping. For example, high charges for legal disposal lead to increased illegal disposal and corruption. Also, somewhat surprisingly, a stricter enforcement on the <b>regulated</b> <b>agent</b> may lead to an increased likelihood of corruption and to higher rates of illegal disposal...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to demonstrate that asymmetric membrane capsules can be used to deliver a poorly water soluble drug with a pH dependent solubility, such as carvedilol, for extended periods of time by modulating solubility with acid. In this study, the effect of the concentration of pH <b>regulating</b> <b>agent</b> and osmotic agents on the release rate of the active material was investigated. For this purpose, asymmetric membrane capsules of carvedilol were prepared using cellulose acetate as a semi-permeable membrane, containing glycerol as plasticizer, and fructose and fumaric acid were used as osmotic <b>agent</b> and pH <b>regulating</b> <b>agent,</b> respectively. In osmotic systems, the release rate of an excipient relative to the release rate of the drug is an important factor that determines the duration of drug release. Owing to high acidic strength and low aqueous solubility, fumaric acid resulted in simultaneous release and maintained a constant micro-environmental condition for the dissolution of the weakly basic drug. Finally, it was observed that the release rate of carvedilol was influenced by the concentration of fumaric acid and fructose. The optimal formulation was found to be able to deliver carvedilol at the rate of approximate zero-order up to 20 h, independent of release media and agitation rate...|$|R

I use three examples of actual electronic institutions that show different and complementary features in order to motivate a number of distinctions that may be used to treat empirical features in a systematic way. ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the features of}} an optimal regulatory policy composed of pollution standards and probabilities of inspection to verify firms' behavior, where fines for noncompliance depend {{on the degree of}} violation.

In the event the planner has perfect information about the firns, we find that, whe the optimal policy entails noncompliance, the optimal standard is always equal to zero, suggesting the superiority of probabilistic environmental taxes versus positive standards. However this is no longer true when the planner has incomplete information about the <b>regulated</b> <b>agents.</b> standard-setting; costly inspection; convex fines;...|$|R
