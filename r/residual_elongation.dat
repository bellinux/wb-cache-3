40|$|Pseudoelastic {{behaviour}} {{of three}} types of Ti–Ni shape memory alloys in a pseudoelastic state has been studied under conditions of maximum strain- and maximum stress-controlled cycling. Experimental results proved that residual deformation after unloading increases {{with the number of}} cycles; however, critical stress for the induction of martensite and the energy dissipated in one cycle decline during cycling. A higher critical stress for slip, and more intense cyclic dislocation hardening promoted by greater maximum deformation and greater maximum applied stresses, generally reduce the rate at which <b>residual</b> <b>elongation</b> grows with the number of cycles, and tend to stabilise the cyclic stress-elongation diagrams. The small magnitude of critical stress for slip in lownickel alloys, and also cyclic strain hardening, induce greater internal stresses and a more marked decrease in critical stress for the induction of martensite as cycling progresses. Detailed analysis of plastic deformation propagation in cyclically loaded specimen helped develop a model of dependence of <b>residual</b> <b>elongation</b> on the number of cycles. This model enables identification of three main factors that govern the magnitude of residual elongation: one residual plastic elongation caused by dislocation hardening after the alloy is heat treated, and two cyclic strain hardening parameters describing how <b>residual</b> <b>elongation</b> grows with number of cycles, and how this <b>residual</b> <b>elongation</b> is reduced, as cycles increase, by the rising critical stress level for slip. The model has proved to yield very close agreement with experimental findings. Web of Science 47 suppl. s 1 E 466 E 45...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the findings of}} an experimental study of how mechanical cycling of Ti-Ni and Ti-Ni-Cu shape memory alloys in the pseudoelastic (PE) state affects their <b>residual</b> <b>elongation</b> after unloading, their critical stress for martensite formation and their hysteresis or amount of energy dissipated during one cycle. Specimens were cycled in two basic modes: hard loading cycles at a constant e(max) and soft ones at a constant sigma(ms). In the hard cycling the authors further investigated how the PE characteristics respond to various strain rates and how the strain rate changes. Each of the examined alloys was cycled in the PE deformation mode at a temperature where each specimen can be deformed at the same constant critical stress for martensite formation in the first cycle of the test. As the number of cycles increases, the residual strain e(o) grows, while both the stress σms for martensite transformation and the hysteresis W decrease. The rate at which e(o) grows depends on sigma s, sigma(ms) during cycling {{and the type of}} cycling mode. By considering the two factors sigma(s) and sigma(ms), the rather complicated effect of cyclic deformation on the PE characteristics was explained. Cycling at higher strain rates has been found to increase the <b>residual</b> <b>elongation</b> left after the specimen is unloaded and to cause a more raped decline of the critical stress for martensite formation as cycling continues. After changes in the elongation rate the stability of the cyclic stress-elongation diagram depends on the amount of <b>residual</b> <b>elongation</b> present and on the stability of that diagram during the first cycling at the original elongation rate...|$|E

As the depurinated ribosomes retain weak translation elongation activities, {{it was suggested}} that RALyase completes the ribosome inactivation. To confirm this point, we measured the effects of the phosphodiester cleavage using a fusion of wheat RALyase produced with a cell-free protein synthesis system from wheat germ. The results indicated that RALyase diminishes the <b>residual</b> <b>elongation</b> activities of the depurinated ribosomes...|$|E
40|$|Isolated tendons {{subjected}} to cyclic tensile loads {{higher than those}} experienced in the tendons' recent history exhibit 'conditioning', i. e. gradually increasing elongations upon loading and gradually increasing <b>residual</b> <b>elongations</b> after unloading {{in the first few}} loading-unloading cycles. The present study examines whether this behaviour is a measurement artefact or an actual time-dependent property. The gastrocnemius tendons of six men who refrained from rigorous physical activities prior to the experiment were loaded cyclically by 10 repeated isometric plantarflexion contractions at 80 % of the moment generated during plantarflexion maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). In each contraction, the elongation of the gastrocnemius tendon at 80 % of MVC and the <b>residual</b> tendon <b>elongation</b> after relaxation were obtained from the analysis of sonographs recorded during the test. The tendon elongation during activation and the <b>residual</b> tendon <b>elongation</b> after relaxation increased by ca. 5 mm from the first contraction to the tenth contraction, with no changes obtained after the fifth contraction. The behaviour of the tendon in the first five contractions indicates the presence of conditioning. It is therefore concluded that conditioning is a relevant property and not an artefact associated with in vitro testing. This has implications for joint kinematics and muscle excursion...|$|R
40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{finite element}} model of the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of boron on a carbon substrate (B/C) is developed. The model includes {{an expansion of the}} boron after deposition due to atomic rearrangement and includes creep of the boron and carbon. Curves are presented to show how the principal residual stresses and the filament elongation vary as the parameters defining deposition strain and creep are varied. The calculated results are compared with experimental axial <b>residual</b> stress and <b>elongation</b> measurements made on B/C filaments. This comparison requires that for good agreement between calculated and experimental results, the deposited boron must continue to expand after deposition, and that the build-up of residual stresses is limited by significant boron and carbon creep rates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{article focuses}} on the {{development}} of a transparent and uniform understanding of possibilities for three-dimensional ~ 3 D! imaging in scanning transmission and confocal electron microscopes ~STEMs and SCEMs!, with an emphasis on the annular dark-field STEM ~ADF-STEM!, bright-field SCEM ~BF-SCEM!, and ADF-SCEM configurations. The incoherent imaging approximation and a 3 D linear imaging model for ADF-STEM are reviewed. A 3 D phase contrast model for coherent-SCEM as well as a pictorial way to find boundaries of information transfer in reciprocal space are reviewed and applied to both BF- and ADF-SCEM to study their 3 D point spread functions and contrast transfer functions ~CTFs!. ADF-STEM is capable of detecting the depths of dopant atoms in amorphous materials but can fail for crystalline materials when channeling substantially modifies the electron propagation. For the imaging of extended ~i. e., nonpointlike! features, ADF-STEM and BF-SCEM exhibit strong elongation artifacts due to the missing cone of information. ADF-SCEM shows an improvement over ADF-STEM/BF-SCEM due to its differential phase contrast eliminat-ing slowly varying backgrounds, an effect that partially suppresses the elongation artifacts. However, the 3 D CTF still has a cone of missing information that will result in some <b>residual</b> feature <b>elongation</b> as has been observed in A.

30|$|Three {{groups of}} menisci were tested–(1) intact controls, (2) suture repairs, and (3) scaffold-augmented repairs, as {{described}} above. For each, the anterior and posterior {{portions of the}} menisci were trimmed to provide relatively flat surfaces for clamping (Fig.  2). Menisci were clamped in a materials testing machine such that the axis of tension was perpendicular to the simulated tear (Fig.  2 c). After preloading to 5  N, the construct was cyclically loaded from 5 to 20  N for 500  cycles {{at a rate of}} 20  mm/min, pausing after 250  cycles to tighten the clamps. Thereafter, the construct was loaded to failure at the same rate. <b>Residual</b> <b>elongation</b> (indicative of gap formation) was determined after 1, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500  cycles.

The {{influence}} of fatigue stressing of annealed medium-carbon steel (with 0. 45 wt. % of carbon) on {{the change of}} magnetic characteristics of the steel, in particular, coercive force and residual magnetic induction for major and minor magnetic hysteresis loops has been investigated. It {{has been shown that}} the magnetic characteristics considered are sensitive to both large and small plastic deformations accumulated under fatigue loading. The dependences of residual mechanical properties on the number of cycles (accumulated plastic deformation) have been established, as well as correlation between coercive force for minor magnetic hysteresis loops in weak fields (Rayleigh region) and <b>residual</b> <b>elongation.</b> The possibility of magnetic nondestructive testing of accumulated plastic deformation and estimation of the residual material life of a material under cyclic loading has been demonstrated...|$|E

In comparison, the biomimetic scaffold possessed moduli in the parallel (68.7 [*]±[*] 14.7  MPa) and perpendicular (39.4 [*]±[*] 11.6  MPa) directions that respectively approximate the reported circumferential and radial tensile properties of native menisci. The ultimate suture retention load of the biomimetic scaffold in the parallel direction (7.2 [*]±[*] 1.6  N) {{was significantly higher than}} all other conditions (p[*]<[*] 0.001). Biomimetic scaffold augmentation did not compromise mechanical properties when compared against suture repair in terms of <b>residual</b> <b>elongation</b> after 500  cycles (scaffold: 5.05 [*]±[*] 0.89  mm vs. repair: 4.78 [*]±[*] 1.24  mm), ultimate failure load (137.1 [*]±[*] 31.0  N vs. 124.4 [*]±[*] 21.4  N), ultimate elongation (12.09 [*]±[*] 5.89  mm vs. 10.14 [*]±[*] 4.61  mm), and stiffness (20.8 [*]±[*] 3.6 vs. 18.4 [*]±[*] 4.7  N/mm).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the effect of load history on the behavior of axially reinforced concrete prisms. The six test specimens were divided into three pairs in which one specimen was tested under repeated tension, and the other under repeated tension and compression loading. A test apparatus was designed to enable the use of a standard hydraulic testing machine to apply the tension and compression loads; The strain along the bar and the total deformation of the specimens were continuously recorded. The main factors studied were the effect of the peak stress level, the effect of repeated cycles and the effect of repeated tension loads versus repeated tension and compression loads. The strain distribution, the bond stresses, the <b>residual</b> and total <b>elongations,</b> the crack width and the stiffness of the concrete prism were the main items discussed...|$|R
40|$|Aphidicolin is {{a highly}} {{specific}} inhibitor of DNA polymerase α and has been most useful for assessing the role of this enzyme in various replication processes (J. A. Huberman, Cell 23 : 647 - 648, 1981). Both nuclear DNA replication and simian virus 40 DNA replication are highly sensitive to this drug (Krokan et al., Biochemistry 18 : 4431 - 4443, 1979), whereas mitochondrial DNA synthesis is completely insensitive (Zimmerman et al., J. Biol. Chem. 255 : 11847 - 11852, 1980). Adenovirus DNA replication is sensitive to aphidicolin, but only at much higher concentrations. These patterns of sensitivity are seen both in vivo and in vitro (Krokan et al., Biochemistry 18 : 4431 - 4443, 1979). A temperature-sensitive mutant of adenovirus type 5 known as H 5 ts 125 is able to complete but not initiate new rounds of replication at nonpermissive temperatures (P. C. van der Vliet and J. S. Sussenbach, Virology 67 : 415 - 426, 1975). When cells infected with H 5 ts 125 were shifted from permissive (33 °C) to nonpermissive (41 °C) conditions, the <b>residual</b> DNA synthesis (<b>elongation)</b> showed a striking increase in sensitivity to aphidicolin. The temperature-sensitive mutation of H 5 ts 125 is in the gene for the 72 -kilodalton single-stranded DNA-binding protein. This demonstrated that the increased resistance to aphidicolin shown by adenovirus DNA replication was dependent on that protein. It also supports an elongation role for both DNA polymerase α and the 72 -kilodalton single-stranded DNA-binding protein in adenovirus DNA replication. Further support for an elongation role of DNA polymerase α came from experiments with permissive temperature conditions and inhibiting levels of aphidicolin {{in which it was}} shown that newly initiated strands failed to elongate to completion...|$|R
30|$|Three {{multilayered}} electrospun scaffolds {{with different}} fiber orientations were fabricated–aligned, random, and biomimetic. The biomimetic scaffold {{was comprised of}} four layers {{in the following order}} (deep to superficial)–aligned longitudinal, aligned transverse, aligned longitudinal, and random–respectively corresponding to circumferential, radial, circumferential, and superficial collagen fibers of the native meniscus. Material properties (i.e., ultimate stress, modulus, etc.) of the scaffolds were determined in the parallel and perpendicular directions, as was suture retention strength. Complete radial tears of lateral bovine meniscus explants were repaired with a double horizontal mattress suture technique, with or without inclusion of the biomimetic scaffold sheath. Both repair groups, as well as native controls, were cyclically loaded between 5 and 20  N for 500  cycles and then loaded to failure. Clamp-to-clamp distance (i.e., <b>residual</b> <b>elongation)</b> was measured following various cycles. Ultimate load, ultimate elongation, and stiffness, were also determined. Group differences were evaluated by one-way ANOVA or Student’s t-test where appropriate.|$|E

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{titanium}} alloy Ti- 6246 (Ti– 6 Al– 2 Sn– 4 Zr– 6 Mo, wt-%) for gas turbine compressors allows an increase in working temperature and stress level. Under severe service conditions, the material experiences combined high temperature and high mechanical stress and, in saline atmospheres, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) can occur, leading to catastrophic mechanical failure. The present study was performed to evaluate the potential of several surface treatments to protect Ti- 6246 alloy, after salt deposit, from hot salt SCC at temperatures ? 500 °C and 500 MPa static mechanical stress conditions. Shot peening, thermal oxidation and metal–ceramic coatings were investigated. Experimental results confirm the existence of brittle stress corrosion phenomena marked by a low <b>residual</b> <b>elongation</b> of test samples {{and the presence of}} oxides on the fracture surfaces. Both shot peening and metal–ceramic coatings increase the hot salt SCC resistance of the alloy. Times to rupture were improved by a factor of 3 for shot peening and by a factor of 10 for metal–ceramic coatings. Inversely, the time to rupture of preoxidised alloys has been halved compared with uncoated alloys.

30|$|While the {{biomimetic}} scaffold mimicked {{the topography}} and tensile properties of native menisci, {{it did not}} improve the mechanical properties of a simulated radial meniscal tear repaired with suture. Both the ultimate failure load (~ 125  N) and stiffness (~ 19  N/mm) of the repair and scaffold-augmented groups are comparable to reported values using similar suture techniques in cadaveric models (Beamer et al. 2015; Bhatia et al. 2015; Branch et al. 2015; Herbort et al. 2010). In testing different suture techniques, Herbort et al. (2010) and Branch et al. (2015) confirmed that multiple sutures are superior to a single suture loop, providing in vitro support to the clinical standard of using an inside-out double horizontal suture technique for repair of radial tears. In this study, a single horizontal stitch was placed equidistant from the central and peripheral rims to reduce the torn edges before performing a double horizontal mattress suture repair, with or without inclusion of the biomimetic scaffold serving as a sheath. As visualization of tear apposition was impossible with the opaque scaffold in place, the reducing stitch was necessary. This third stitch likely accounts for the elevated ultimate load found in this study, as compared against those reported by Herbort et al. (2010) (109  N) and Bhatia et al. (2015) (106  N) when a double horizontal suture technique was evaluated. Unfortunately, the scaffold also prevented direct visualization of markers {{that might otherwise be}} used to track tissue strain and gap formation, as utilized in related studies (Beamer et al. 2015; Bhatia et al. 2015). Consequently, <b>residual</b> <b>elongation</b> (i.e. clamp-to-clamp distance) was used to indicate gap formation, although the ~ 1  mm elongation found after 500  cycles in the native controls suggests that clamp slippage and/or viscoelastic creep partially contributed to this measurement of gap formation.|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} use of Nickel-Titanium (Nitinol) {{in biomedical applications}} {{requires an}} accurate control of its unique mechanical properties. The {{purpose of this study}} is to analyze the effects of a wide range of heat treatments on the mechanical behavior of hot-rolled and cold-drawn Nitinol. Results comprise an understanding of the effect of heat treatment temperature and time variation on final material response which is imperative for optimization of material properties. Thirty-three heat treatment variations are tested by combining three durations, 10 minutes, 90 minutes, and 8 hours, with eleven different heat treatment temperatures between 200 °C and 440 °C. Following heat treatment, the Nitinol samples undergo tensile testing with upper plateau strength, lower plateau strength, ultimate tensile strength, strain to failure, and <b>residual</b> <b>elongation</b> compared for all test groups. 	 Heat treatment "power" is used to describe the efficacy of different combinations of heat treatment temperature and duration. When using hot-rolled Nitinol, results show a low heat treatment power does not create significant precipitation hardening or a significant decrease in martensite transformation stress, resulting in a high upper plateau strength, high residual strain values, and evidence of plastic deformation upon unloading. Moderate power treatments lead to sufficient hardening of the material and a decrease in martensite transformation stress resulting in a pseudoelastic response. Increasing to a high treatment power further decreases the transformation stress and increases the martensite transformation temperature leading to a shape-memory response in hot rolled Nitinol. When using cold-drawn Nitinol, low and moderate heat treatment power levels result in the material exhibiting a pseudoelastic response. Increasing heat treatment power shows the same effects on martensite transformation stress and temperature as seen with the hot-rolled material resulting in a material response transition from pseudoelastic to shape memory.

40|$|The {{double-stranded}} linear DNA of Bacillus subtilis phage Ø 29 is replicated by {{a mechanism}} {{in which a}} terminal protein (TP) acts as a primer. The second 3 ′-terminal nucleotide of the template directs the incorporation of the 5 ′-terminal nucleotide into the TP, giving rise to the initiation complex TP-dAMP. Elongation then proceeds by a sliding-back mechanism in which the dAMP covalently linked to the TP pairs to the 3 ′-terminal nucleotide of the template strand to recover full-length DNA. We have studied the sequence requirements for efficient initiation of replication using mutated TP-free double-stranded DNA fragments. Efficient initiation only requires the terminal repetition 5 ′-AA. The 3 ′-terminal T, although not used as template, increases the affinity of DNA polymerase for the initiator nucleotide; in addition, although to a minor extent, the third 3 ′-terminal position also directs {{the formation of the}} initiation complex and modulates the initiation rate at the second position. Efficient elongation requires a previous sliding-back, demanding again a repetition of two nucleotides at the 3 ′ end; if the sliding-back is prevented, a <b>residual</b> <b>elongation</b> can proceed directly from the second position or after jumping back from the third to the first position.
