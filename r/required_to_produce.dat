5|$|In July 2009 it was {{announced}} that traces of ammonia had been found in the plumes during flybys in July and October 2008. Reducing the freezing point of water with ammonia would also allow for outgassing and higher gas pressure, and less heat required to power the water plumes. The subsurface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia–water slurry at temperatures as low as , and thus less energy is <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> the plume activity.|$|E
5|$|Shooting {{took place}} over several days at Music Bank, the famous {{rehearsal}} studios in London. Actor Michael spent forty hours practising the drumming beforehand, but with vision inside the suit limited to a camera feed piped to a small screen inside the head, precision was almost impossible. Many takes ended with the wooden drum sticks broken against the rims, sending shards of wood flying off-camera. This, combined with the difficulty of choreographing the delicate movements of the gorilla head with Michael's acting, meant that 35takes were <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> the final 90-second scene.|$|E

5|$|The disks of most {{stars are}} much too small in angular size to be {{observed}} with current ground-based optical telescopes, and so interferometer telescopes are <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> images of these objects. Another technique for measuring the angular size of stars is through occultation. By precisely measuring the drop in brightness of a star as it is occulted by the Moon (or the rise in brightness when it reappears), the star's angular diameter can be computed.|$|E
5|$|English local {{authorities}} are <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> Local Transport Plans (LTPs), strategies for developing local integrated transport {{as part of}} a longer-term vision. LTPs are used by central government to allocate funding for transport schemes. The final Local Transport Plan 2006–2011 for York was submitted to central government in March 2006. The plan addresses the fact that traffic in York is predicted to grow considerably over the coming years. The key aims of the plan are to ease congestion and improve accessibility, air quality and safety. Major funding allocations earmarked for {{the first five years of}} the plan's life span include outer ring road improvements, improved management of the highway network, improvements to the bus network including park and ride services, provision of off-road walking and cycling routes, air quality improvements and safety measures.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea of a}} galactic {{habitable}} zone {{was further}} developed in 2001 in a paper by Ward and Brownlee, in collaboration with Guillermo Gonzalez of the University of Washington. In that paper, Gonzalez, Brownlee, and Ward stated that regions near the galactic halo would lack the heavier elements <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> habitable terrestrial planets, thus creating an outward limit {{to the size of}} the galactic habitable zone. Being too close to the galactic center, however, would expose an otherwise habitable planet to numerous supernovae and other energetic cosmic events, as well as excessive cometary impacts caused by perturbations of the host star's Oort cloud. Therefore, the authors established an inner boundary for the galactic habitable zone, located just outside the galactic bulge.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to taxonomic research, collections can provide information {{relevant to the}} study of variety of other ornithological questions, including comparative anatomy, ecology, behavior, disease, and conservation. Forensic ornithologists use collections to identify species involved in aircraft bird strikes, imported materials containing bird parts, and birds killed through various human activities, legal and illegal. In addition, collections are used by zooarchaeologists to identify bird bones at prehistoric human sites or species of origin for feathers used in human cultural artifacts. Collections also have been heavily used by artists, particularly for the production of plates for ornithological field guides. The close-up observation and opportunity for manipulation provided by preserved study skins makes them, together with field observations and photography, to be an important basis for painters of field guide plates of birds. Most bird species have several unique plumages that distinguish immature from adults, males from females, and breeders from non-breeders. Thus, many different specimens may be <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> a thorough plate for identification of a given species. Accurate colour measurements using spectrometry are possible from specimens.|$|E

5|$|Some {{forms of}} mimicry {{do not fit}} easily within the {{classification}} given above. Floral mimicry is induced by the discomycete fungus Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi. In this unusual case, a fungal plant pathogen infects leaves of blueberries, causing them to secrete sugars, in effect mimicking the nectar of flowers. To the naked eye the leaves do not look like flowers, yet they still attract pollinating insects like bees using an ultraviolet signal. This case is unusual, in that the fungus benefits from the deception {{but it is the}} leaves that act as mimics, being harmed in the process. It is similar to host-parasite mimicry, but the host does not receive the signal. It has a little in common with automimicry, but the plant does not benefit from the mimicry, and the action of the pathogen is <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> it.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Army {{generally}} had {{a long-standing}} policy of using British-designed equipment, but equipment from Australia, the United States {{and some other}} countries was introduced into service in the war's later years. Pre-war defence policies favoured the RAN, which received the majority of defence spending in the interwar period. The result was that when war came in 1939, the Army's equipment was of World War I vintage, and Australian factories were only capable of producing small arms. Most equipment was obsolescent {{and had to be}} replaced, and new factories were <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> the latest weapons, equipment and motor vehicles. Some 2,860 motor vehicles and motorcycles suitable for military use were purchased in 1939 for the Militia and another 784 for the 6th Division, but since a division's war establishment was around 3,000, this was only enough for training. In February 1940, the Treasury urged the War Cabinet to slow orders of motor vehicles to save the shipping space used for sending them to the Middle East for wheat cargoes.|$|E

5|$|The {{shell of}} Cloud Gate was fully erected {{for the grand}} opening of Millennium Park on July 15, 2004, {{although}} it was unpolished and thus unfinished, because its assembly had fallen behind schedule. The piece was temporarily uncovered on July 8 for the opening, although Kapoor was unhappy with this as it allowed the public to see the sculpture in an unfinished state. The original plan was to re-erect the tent around the sculpture for polishing on July 24, but public appreciation for the piece convinced park officials to leave it uncovered for several months. The tent was again erected in January 2005 as a 24-person crew from Ironworkers Local 63 polished the seams between each plate. In order to grind, sand and polish the seams, six levels of scaffolding were erected around {{the sides of the}} sculpture, while climbing ropes and harnesses were used to polish harder-to-reach areas. When the upper and side portions of the shell were completed, the tent was once again removed in August 2005. On October 3, the omphalos was closed off as workers polished the final section. Every weld on the Cloud Gate underwent a five-stage process, <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> the sculpture's mirror-like finish.|$|E
