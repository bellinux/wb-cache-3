40|$|Grahame Boocock and Margaret Woods are Lecturers in Banking and Finance, and Financial Management, {{respectively}} at Loughborough University Business School, England. The paper {{examines how}} venture fund managers select their investee companies, by exploring the evaluation criteria {{and the decision}} making process adopted at one UK <b>Regional</b> <b>Venture</b> <b>Fund</b> (henceforth {{referred to as the}} Fund). The analysis confirms that relatively consistent evaluation criteria are applied across the industry and corroborates previous models which suggest that venture capitalists’ decision making consists of several stages. With the benefit of access to the Fund’s internal records, however, this paper adds to the current literature by differentiating the evaluation criteria used at each successive stage of the decision-making process. The paper presents a model of the Fund’s activities which demonstrates that the relative importance attached to the evaluation criteria changes as applications are systematically processed. Proposals have to satisfy different criteria at each stage of the decision-making process before they receive funding. In the vast majority of cases, applications are rejected by the fund managers. In addition, the length of time taken by the fund managers in appraising propositions can lead to the withdrawal of applications at an advanced stage...|$|E

40|$|Hybrid' {{venture capital}} schemes backed by {{both private and}} public sector funding play an {{increasingly}} important role in the risk capital funding of early-stage firms with the potential for significant growth. We analysed the impact of investment from six UK government-backed venture capital schemes on 782 funded firms over the period 1995 - 2008. The six schemes that are the focus of this analysis are the Enterprise Capital Funds (ECFs), Early Growth <b>Funds</b> (EGFs), <b>Regional</b> <b>Venture</b> Capital <b>Funds</b> (RVCFs), Scottish Enterprise-backed Funds, University Challenge Funds (UCFs), and Welsh Hybrid Funds...|$|R
40|$|The UK Labour Government has {{provided}} {{support for the}} establishment of <b>regional</b> <b>venture</b> capital <b>funds</b> in each of the English regions as part of its drive to create an entrepreneurially led knowledge- based economy. This initiative is a response to persistent gaps in the provision of start-up and early stage venture capital. In this paper we question the likely effectiveness of the initiative on four counts. First, {{there is a lack of}} early stage venture capital skills available to manage the funds. Second, the small size of the funds will make it difficult for them to achieve financial viability. Third, the funds are targeting the wrong problem. The maximum investment that they are allowed to make is £ 250, 000; they may subsequently provide up to an additional £ 250, 000 in follow-on financing. However, the main funding gap in the UK is in the £ 250, 000 to £ 1 million range. Finally, the proposal ignores the role of demand-side constraints in contributing to the equity gap. The paper concludes that a more comprehensive approach is required to address equity capital gaps at the regional level...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of venture}} capital in {{economic}} development increasingly {{is recognized as}} central {{to the development of}} an entrepreneurial economy. However, the supply of venture capital is not distributed evenly across the space economy. In the UK, evidence for the 1980 s demonstrated that venture capital investments were highly concentrated in Greater London and the South East, reinforcing the existing patterns of regional concentration of economic activity. This paper reviews the <b>regional</b> distribution of <b>venture</b> capital investments in the UK in the 1990 s, a period of massive growth in venture capital investment activity. It concludes that the <b>regional</b> concentration of <b>venture</b> capital investment has been considerably reduced since the 1980 s. However, more detailed analysis of the data demonstrates that this shift towards a less unequal regional distribution has been driven by so–called ‘merchant’ venture capital – investments in large–scale management buy–outs and buy–ins which facilitate corporate restructuring through ownership change and often have adverse consequences for employment. ‘Classic’ venture capital – investments in young entrepreneurial companies with high growth potential – remains highly concentrated in London and the South East, and also in Scotland. This reflects both supply– and demand–side factors. The Government’s new <b>regional</b> <b>venture</b> capital <b>funds</b> are unlikely to be effective in closing this regional finance gap. An alternative approach to intervention, {{in the context of the}} increasing globalization of venture capital investments, is to seek to attract venture capital money and expertise from elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|The intension of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the industrial highlights and strengths of the East Midlands region, both at the regional and local administrative area level. In addition, representative companies of each highlighted industry were identified. The purpose of this information was to help inform and assist a <b>regional</b> <b>Venture</b> Capital <b>Fund</b> (East Midlands Early Growth Fund) in their deal generation and assessment activities. This cross-sectional survey used three sources of data: 1. 	Employment data statistics were used to identify industrial highlights. 2. 	A company report database was used to generate a list of companies present within each industrial highlight. 3. 	A survey of local economic development professionals cross referenced secondary sources as well as provided additional information. Industrial highlights or strengths were identified for the East Midlands Region and all 40 constituent areas along with a number of exemplar companies. Analysis of the geographical distribution of these strengths identified some agglomerations of industries that may be indicative of the presence of clusters: 1. 	Agricultural cluster centred in Lincolnshire with specific strengths in poultry and Fruit & Vegetable production and processing. 2. 	Food processing, located across the region 3. 	Plastics manufacture around Nottingham and Corby/ Rutland. 4. 	Textiles, with specific strengths in footwear manufacture in Northamptonshire, and kitted and crocheted fabric around Leicester and Ashfield/ Amber Valley. 5. 	Furniture manufacture, particularly production of seats and chairs to the west of the City of Nottingham (Erewash). 6. 	Construction, with highlights in concrete manufacture. 7. 	Light engineering, specifically with highlights in engine manufacture, including both electrical motors and non-electrical engines, as well as the transport equipment sector, with specific loci around Derby in the rail (or tram) and aerospace industries...|$|R
