50|$|This {{demonstration}} {{appears to}} suggest that capacitors store their charge inside their dielectric. This theory was taught throughout the 1800s. However, this phenomenon is a special effect caused by the high voltage on the Leyden jar. In the dissectible Leyden jar, charge is transferred {{to the surface of}} the glass cup by corona discharge when the jar is disassembled; this is the source of the <b>residual</b> <b>charge</b> after the jar is reassembled. Handling the cup while disassembled does not provide enough contact to remove all the surface charge. Soda glass is hygroscopic and forms a partially conductive coating on its surface, which holds the charge. Addenbrook (1922) found that in a dissectible jar made of paraffin wax, or glass baked to remove moisture, the charge remained on the metal plates. Zeleny (1944) confirmed these results and observed the corona charge transfer. In capacitors generally, the charge is not stored in the dielectric, but on the inside surfaces of the plates, as can be observed from capacitors that can function with a vacuum between their plates.|$|E
50|$|When a {{turn-off}} {{negative voltage}} signal {{is applied to}} the MOSFET connected to the cathode, it turns off and transfers all the current away from the cathode (N-emitter of the NPN transistor in the thyristor) into the base gate via MOSFET connected to the gate of the thyristor. This stops regenerative latching process and results in a fast turn-off. Both the MOSFET connected to the cathode and MOSFET connected to the gate of the thyristor are not subjected to high-voltage stresses irrespective of the magnitude of the voltage on the ETO, due to the internal structure of the thyristor containing a P-N junction. The drawback of connecting a MOSFET in series is that it has to carry the main thyristor current and it also increases the total voltage drop by about 0.3 to 0.5V and its corresponding losses. Similar to a GTO, the ETO has a long turn-off tail of current {{at the end of the}} turn-off and the next turn-on must wait until the <b>residual</b> <b>charge</b> on the anode side is dissipated through the recombination process.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The I–V {{characteristics}} of a room-temperature atmospheric pressure air plasma are investigated. The plasma is driven by a homemade direct-current power supply. However, dis-charge currents appear pulsed. The pulse behavior {{is determined by the}} ion drift mechanism. The effects of the applied voltage and the gap distance d on pulsed repetition frequency f and peak value Ipeak of the current pulse are studied in detail. It is found that the applied voltage dramatically affects Ipeak but not the pulse repetition frequency f. When the applied voltage is higher than 12 kV, the voltage on the electrode just before breakdown starts to decrease with the increase in the applied voltage. A detail analysis shows that the <b>residual</b> <b>charges</b> {{play an important role in}} the initiation of breakdown under this condition. On the other hand, when the applied voltage is lower than 12 kV, the voltage on the electrode just before breakdown keeps constant for various applied voltages; it indicates that the <b>residual</b> <b>charges</b> play a minor role in the initiation of breakdown for this circumstance. It is found that the pulse repetition frequency is determined by the time for the ion drift to the electrode. A further analysis shows that the average electric field keeps constant for various gap distances. The pulse repetition frequency is inversely proportional to the gap distance, which is exactly observed in the experiments.

In practice, even a small <b>residual</b> <b>charge</b> on any sector is enough to start the process going once the discs start to rotate. The machine will only work satisfactorily in a dry atmosphere. It does require mechanical power to turn the disks against the electric field, and it is this energy that the machine converts into electric power. The steady state output of the Wimshurst machine is a direct (non-alternating) current that is proportional to the area covered by the metal sector, the rotation speed, and a complicated function of the initial charge distribution. The insulation {{and the size of the}} machine determine the maximum output voltage that can be reached. The accumulated spark energy can be increased by adding a pair of Leyden jars, an early type of capacitor suitable for high voltages, with the jars’ inner plates independently connected to each of the output terminals and the jars’ outer plates interconnected. A typical Wimshurst machine can produce sparks that are about a third of the disc's diameter in length and several tens of microamperes.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{one could}} use a cation {{exchange}} (negatively charged) surface chemistry for ERLIC separations to reduce the influence on retention of anionic (negatively charged) groups (the phosphates of nucleotides or of phosphonyl antibiotic mixtures; or sialic acid groups of modified carbohydrates) to now allow separation based more on the basic and/or neutral functional groups of these molecules. Modifying the polarity of a weakly ionic group (e.g. carboxyl) on the surface is easily accomplished by adjusting the pH to be within two pH units of that group's pKa. For strongly ionic functional groups of the surface (i.e. sulfates or phosphates) one could instead use a lower amount of buffer so the <b>residual</b> <b>charge</b> is not completely ion paired.

This enhances the influence of the column's sulfonic acid functional groups of its surface chemistry over its, slightly diminished (by pH), quaternary amine. Commensurate with this, these analytes will show a reduced retention on the column eluting earlier, and in higher amounts of organic solvent, than if a neutral polar HILIC surface were used.
