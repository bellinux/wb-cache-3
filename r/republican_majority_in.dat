5|$|In response, Gingrich {{stated that}} he had not quit the race for the Republican nomination, and pointed to his {{experience}} running for 5 years to win his seat in Congress, spending 16 years helping to build a <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the house and working for decades to build a <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> Georgia. Some commentators noted Gingrich's resilience throughout his career, in particular with regards to his presidential campaign.|$|E
5|$|During the 1910 midterm {{election}} campaign, Roosevelt involved himself in New York politics, while Taft with donations and influence tried {{to secure the}} election of the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Ohio, former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding. The Republicans suffered losses in the 1910 elections as the Democrats took control of the House and slashed the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the Senate. In New Jersey, Democrat Woodrow Wilson was elected governor, and Harding lost his race in Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor was {{nominated}} to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York by President George H. W. Bush in 1991; confirmation followed in 1992. In 1997, she {{was nominated}} by President Bill Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Her nomination was slowed by the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the United States Senate, {{but she was}} eventually confirmed in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the New York University School of Law and Columbia Law School.|$|E
50|$|AL: At Large delegates {{are elected}} {{as representatives of}} the whole state. Each state is allotted ten delegates and each {{territory}} six delegates. Each state can {{on top of this}} get bonus delegates based on whether it has a Republican governor, it has <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> one or all chambers of its state legislature, and whether it has <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> its delegation to the U.S. Congress, among other factors. With the exception of Missouri all these delegates are allocated at the state level.|$|R
50|$|On December 3, 1969, the Court of Appeals did {{not allow}} a re-apportionment of the {{legislative}} districts which the <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> both Houses intended to enact in time {{to be used for}} the elections in November 1970.|$|R

5|$|Again {{unable to}} get his {{expanded}} gambling proposal past the Senate, Beshear attempted to chip away at the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> that chamber by appointing some Republican senators to lucrative positions in the executive and judicial branches {{in advance of the}} 2010 General Assembly. Shortly after the special session, Beshear named Republican senator Charlie Borders to the state Public Safety Commission. That appointment set up a special election for Borders' seat, which was won by Democratic senator Robin Webb, reducing the Republican majority to 20–17 with one Independent who usually voted with the Republicans. Following Webb's victory, Beshear appointed Republican senator Dan Kelly to a circuit judgeship, but Republicans held on to that seat in a special election.|$|E
5|$|In {{the electoral}} college, {{the vote was}} more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and border states, but Garfield swept {{all but one of}} the Northern states (the {{exception}} was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfield’s triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214–155 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result would still have been a <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the electoral college. Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.|$|E
5|$|Political party {{strength}} in Virginia has likewise been in flux. In the 2007 state elections, Democrats regained {{control of the}} State Senate, and narrowed the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the House of Delegates to eight seats. Yet elections in 2009 resulted in the election of Republican Bob McDonnell as Governor by a seventeen-point margin, {{the election of a}} Republican Lieutenant Governor and Attorney General, as well as Republican gains of six seats in the House of Delegates. In 2011, the Republican caucus took over two-thirds (68–32) of the seats in the House of Delegates, and a majority of the Senate based on the Lieutenant Governor Bill Bolling as the tie-breaker. Following the 2013 elections, Democrat Terry McAuliffe was elected Governor by two percentage points, and Democrat Ralph Northam was elected Lieutenant Governor by double digits. Republicans, however, maintained their super-majority (68–32) in the House of Delegates. State election seasons traditionally start with the annual Shad Planking event in Wakefield.|$|E
25|$|McDonald {{emphasized}} enhanced fringe benefits. The {{election of}} Dwight Eisenhower as US president and <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> the United States Congress (at least from 1952 to 1954) made expansion of social programs unlikely, but Eisenhower indeed would extend many of Roosevelt's programs.|$|R
50|$|Lincoln's {{preliminary}} Emancipation Proclamation {{was issued}} September 22, 1862. It became the principal issue {{before the public}} in the mid-term elections that year for the 38th Congress. But <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> both houses held (see 'Congress as a campaign machine' below), and the Republicans actually increased their <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the Senate.|$|R
25|$|With Snyder's {{election}} in 2010, <b>Republicans</b> gained a <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the Michigan House {{and increased the}} <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> held <b>in</b> the Michigan Senate.

25|$|Hostettler {{became part}} of the 104th Congress, the first <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the House in 40 years. In {{subsequent}} years, Hostettler depended on his base of fellow social and fiscal conservatives to keep him in office. While southern Indiana has been traditionally Democratic, the 8th has always had a strong social conservative tint.|$|E
25|$|Du Pont {{was elected}} to the U.S. Senate on June 13, 1906, to fill the vacancy in the term {{beginning}} March 4, 1905. During this term, he served with the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the 59th, 60th, and 61st U.S. Congress. In the 61st Congress, he was Chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in the Military Affairs Department.|$|E
25|$|Newt Gingrich, in a {{campaign}} in the 1980s and 1990s to produce a <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the United States House of Representatives, relied heavily on words and phrases that cast Democrats in a negative light. The phrase Democrat Party gained new currency when the Republican Party, led by Gingrich, gained control of the House of Representatives in 1994.|$|E

25|$|During {{these four}} terms, {{he served in}} the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the 69th, 70th, and 71st Congress, but was in the {{minority}} in the 72nd Congress. He did not seek reelection in 1932, {{at the height of the}} Great Depression. In all, Houston served from March 4, 1925 until March 3, 1933, during the administrations of U.S. Presidents Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover.|$|E
25|$|Until the Affordable Healthcare for America Act, a {{combination}} of factors kept health care {{off the top of the}} agenda. For example, politicians were not eager to confront the forces that successfully frustrated the Clinton effort, health maintenance organizations were able to limit cost increases to some extent, and a conservative <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> Congress or a conservative Republican president was in power or in office.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{was elected}} to the U.S. Senate in 1946, {{defeating}} incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator James M. Tunnell.

He was elected to a third term in 1958 and a fourth term in 1964, both times defeating Democrat Elbert N. Carvel, who {{at the time of the}} 1964 election was the Governor of Delaware. During these terms he served in the Republican minority in the 86th, 87th, 88th, 89th, 90th, and 91st Congress. In all, he served for 24 years, from January 3, 1947 until December 31, 1970, when he resigned. This was during the administrations of U.S. Presidents Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard M. Nixon. Williams was Delaware's first four-term U.S. Senator.|$|E
50|$|Bolstered {{by large}} <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> the state house, Ogilvie modernized state government. He {{successfully}} advocated {{for a state}} constitutional convention, increased social spending, and secured Illinois' first state income tax. The latter was particularly unpopular with the electorate, and Ogilvie lost a close election to Daniel Walker in 1972, ending his career in elective office.|$|R
50|$|During the 2014 {{election}} cycle, Schostak {{served as}} Michigan Republican Party Chairman, raising more than $30 million to support Republican candidates across Michigan. Schostak helped re-elect Governor Snyder, Secretary of State Johnson and Attorney General Schuette. Schostak’s vision helped achieve historic <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> the Michigan State Senate and State House, and helped maintain a conservative majority on the Michigan Supreme Court.|$|R

25|$|He also {{proposed}} plans to “refocus Pell Grant {{dollars on the}} students that need them most.” While he did not provide details explaining how he would reform the Pell grant program, some commentators noted that Romney had been generally supportive of federal budget proposals offered by the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the House of Representatives that {{would be likely to}} reduce the total number of students eligible to receive the grants.|$|E
25|$|Heald {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1908, and won {{election}} again in 1910.

2500|$|Sections of the Taft-Hartley Act were {{designed}} to overturn these rulings. In November 1946, voters elected <b>Republican</b> <b>majorities</b> <b>in</b> both houses of [...] Congress. These Republicans were outraged by the NLRB's captive audience rulings.

25|$|Burton {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1904, and won {{election}} again in 1906.

25|$|In the 2012 state {{legislative}} elections, Democrats took back the New Hampshire House of Representatives and narrowed the <b>Republican</b> <b>majority</b> <b>in</b> the New Hampshire Senate to 13–11. In 2012, New Hampshire {{became the first}} state in U.S. history to elect an all-female federal delegation: Democratic Congresswomen Carol Shea-Porter of Congressional District 1 and Ann McLane Kuster of Congressional District 2 accompanied U.S. Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte in 2013.
