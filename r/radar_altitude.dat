Some of the measurements over the high-latitude regions (greater than 50 deg N or 50 deg S) were analyzed for the retrieval of total precipitable water less than 0. 5 g/sq cm both over land and ocean surfaces. The results show that total precipitable water from a relatively dry atmosphere could be estimated with high sensitivity from these radiometric measurements. The retrieved values over ocean surface show a decrease toward the polar region as expected. The retrieved total precipitable water over land correlates positively with the aircraft <b>radar</b> <b>altitude.</b> This positive correlation is expected because the aircraft <b>radar</b> <b>altitude</b> provides a measure of atmospheric water vapor burden above the surface.

40|$|Two {{years of}} VHF radar echo power {{observations}} {{are used to}} examine the structure and variability of the tropopause at Davis, Antarctica. Co-located radiosonde and ozonesonde launches provide data with which to calculate the thermal (lapse-rate) and chemical tropopauses at Davis. The dynamically-controlled radar tropopause {{can be used as a}} definition of the Antarctic tropopause throughout the year under all meteorological conditions. During the extended summer period of December–April (DJFMA) inclusive, radar tropopauses are (0. 2 ± 0. 4) km lower than co-located radiosonde thermal tropopauses and during the extended winter period of June–October (JJASO) inclusive, the radar tropopauses are (0. 8 ± 1. 0) km lower. The radar and ozone tropopauses both show a decrease in altitude under increasingly strong cyclonic conditions. During strong JJASO cyclonic conditions, there are large (several km) differences between radiosonde lapse-rate tropopause <b>altitudes</b> and <b>radar</b> tropopause <b>altitudes.</b> However, the <b>radar</b> tropopause <b>altitude</b> closely corresponds to the altitude of the 2 PVU surface (where 1 PVU = 10 6 m 2 s− 1 K kg− 1 ) for both cyclonic and anticyclonic conditions.

40|$|Normally, {{the damage}} that results in a total loss of the primary flight {{controls}} of a jet transport airplane, including all engines on one side, would be catastrophic. In response, NASA Dryden has conceived an emergency flight control system that uses only the thrust of a wingmounted engine along with a lateral center-of-gravity (CGY) offset from fuel transfer. Initial analysis and simulation studies indicate that such a system works, and recent high-fidelity simulation tests on the MD- 11 and B- 747 suggest that the system provides enough control for a survivable landing. This paper discusses principles of flight control using only a wing engine thrust and CGY offset, along {{with the amount of}} CGY offset capability of some transport airplanes.

40|$|The ROCOZ-A {{radiometer}} measures ozone by long pathlength photometry in {{the stratosphere}} and lower mesosphere. After a rocket launch to an apogee of 70 km, the instrument measures the solar ultraviolet irradiance over its four filter wavelengths as it descends on a parachute. The fundamental values from ROCOZ-A are ozone overburdens versus <b>radar</b> <b>altitude</b> from 53 to 20 km. The slope of these values gives ozone number density. At one standard deviation the repeatability of the ozone overburden measurements averages 2. 4 percent. For ozone number density the repeatability averages 3. 2 percent with a significant increase at altitudes below the ozone number density maximum. The accuracy limits for overburden and number density are estimated at 5 - 7 percent. With auxiliary measurements of pressure and temperature, ozone results are also produced in terms of ozone mixing ratio, albeit with a slight broadening of the estimated accuracy limits. The vertical response of ROCOZ-A ozone measurements (full width at half maximum) is 4 km. The assembly of ROCOZ-A profiles {{can be used to}} compare with measurements from each of the current NASA and NOAA satellite ozone instruments.

40|$|For flight {{automation}} tolerable to {{satellite navigation}} dropouts, {{this paper presents}} a simultaneous localization and mapping method based on radar altimeter measurements and monocular camera images. The novelty within mapping is the combination of radar distance and image triangulation. This approach verifies whether the radar measurement fits to a specific horizontal plane in the map, yielding the sub-set of image features that do most probably correspond with the radar measurement. With this map match of the <b>radar</b> <b>altitude,</b> ambiguities in the radar measurement can be resolved. Since unusable radar measurements are suppressed, this method is suitable for positioning in non-flat terrain, e. g. in mountain areas. For matched data, the method estimates a scale correction factor for the image projection rays in order to remove scale ambiguities of the monocular navigation. Together with mapping, vehicle localization is done which is essentially camera resectioning. Localization can be parameterized with the required number of degrees of freedom depending {{on the availability of}} additional position sensors. The incremental positioning is tested in kilometer-scale outdoor flights of a 30 ~kg unmanned airplane as well as in flights with a Cessna 172 R equipped with camera and radar sensors. The tests show the benefits of the proposed method in flat and hilly terrain, and demonstrate reduction of accumulation errors down to 2 - 6 % over the distance flown. Some constraints of the method for the altitude range are existent, however it is highlighted that this method will generally work on typical flight profiles...|$|E

In general, the comparisons were good and within the expected measurement accuracy and natural variability of the meteorological parameters.

Simulation and flight tests were jointly sponsored by NASA's Aviation Safety Program, Vehicle Systems Safety Technology project and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to evaluate potential safety and operational benefits of SVS/EFVS technologies in low visibility Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) operations. The flight tests were conducted by a team of Honeywell, Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation and NASA personnel with the goal of obtaining pilot-in-the-loop test data for flight validation, verification, and demonstration of selected SVS/EFVS operational and system-level performance capabilities. Nine test flights were flown in Gulfstream's G 450 flight test aircraft outfitted with the SVS/EFVS technologies under low visibility instrument meteorological conditions. Evaluation pilots flew 108 approaches in low visibility weather conditions (600 feet to 3600 feet reported visibility) under different obscurants (mist, fog, drizzle fog, frozen fog) and sky cover (broken, overcast).

40|$|The Aeroflightdynamics Directorate (AMRDEC) {{conducted}} a simulation {{to examine the}} performance of the Comanche Contact Analog world-referenced symbology displayed on the Comanche HIDSS when compared with a compressed symbology design similar to that specified by the former MIL-STD 1295. Six experimental test pilots flew one modified ADS- 33 maneuver (hover turn, bob-up), an unusual attitude recovery, and two terrain flight tactical tasks in the NASA Vertical Motion Simulator (VMS). Analysis of the pilot objective performance data and subjective data showed the following results. Objective test results showed that 1295 symbology yielded more rapid maneuvering in the hover turn bob-up than Contact Analog symbology. The average margin of difference in the time to complete the maneuver was approximately two seconds, which was statistically significant. There were no significant differences measured between symbology sets with respect to altitude or position performance measures for all other maneuvers. The NOE target ID task data showed improved accuracy in determining heading to target when using Contact Analog over MIL-STD- 1295. Subjective test results, including handling qualities ratings (HQRs) and NASA-TLX workload ratings, showed small but consistent advantages of 1295 symbology over Contact Analog for most parameters. For the bob-up maneuver, 1295 symbology handling qualities were rated Desired for lateral position error and time to complete whereas Contact Analog was rated adequate. The average HQRs for all other maneuvers were rated the same for both symbology sets. Pilot comments and the results of an online questionnaire more strongly favored 1295 over Contact Analog. Repeated comments from all six pilots led to a focus on design issues with six Contact Analog symbols. Those symbols were the heading tape, horizon line, <b>radar</b> <b>altitude</b> six-second predictor, the position of the torque symbol, the absence of a hover position cue, and the widespread positioning of the symbology to the outer edges of the display field-of-view. Pilots rated the present design of three of the six symbols as having safety-of-flight implications. Those symbols were the heading tape, horizon line, and six-second predictor. To summarize, test results showed no objective data that would warrant restricting experimental test pilots from flying constrained tasks. Small but consistent advantages were recorded for the MILSTD- 1295 symbology design when executing ADS- 33 constrained tasks. No general performance differences were recorded for the operational maneuvers (NOE, contour flight modes) except for the azimuth-to-target task, which favored the Contact Analog heading tape design. There were consistent and strong pilot comments supporting the MIL-STD- 1295 design over Contact Analog in both this current simulation and in Comanche Sim I. Three Contact Analog symbols warrant modification and further evaluation to mitigate safety-of-flight implications noted by participating test pilots. A plan for symbology redesign and testing was developed. However, the Comanche program was cancelled by Department of Army in February 2004...|$|E
