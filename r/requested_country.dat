50|$|Managing {{the stages}} of an asset {{recovery}} investigation can be extremely time consuming, complex and requires {{a great deal of}} resources, expertise, and political will. First, a victim country must succeed in tracing the stolen assets. Second, the victim country must request cooperation from authorities in the jurisdictions where the assets reside to seize the assets; these requests usually {{come in the form of}} a Mutual Legal Assistance request or a letter rogatory, though some common law countries allow the filing of a Mareva injunction in civil courts to achieve the same end. Third, legal processes must usually be initiated in the <b>requested</b> <b>country</b> in order to confiscate the assets. Following this, requested authorities must repatriate the assets back to the requesting country.|$|E
5000|$|Under Chapter IV of UNCAC, States Parties {{are obliged}} to assist one another {{in every aspect of}} the fight against corruption, {{including}} prevention, investigation, and the prosecution of offenders. Cooperation takes the form of extradition, mutual legal assistance, transfer of sentences persons and criminal proceedings, and law enforcement cooperation. Cooperation in civil and administrative matters is also encouraged. Based on Chapter IV, UNCAC itself {{can be used as a}} basis for extradition, mutual legal assistance and law enforcement with respect to corruption-related offences. [...] "Dual criminality", which is a requirement that the relevant offence shall be criminalized in both the requesting and <b>requested</b> <b>country,</b> is considered fulfilled irrespective of whether the same terminology or category of offense is used in both jurisdictions. In case of a request for assistance involving non-coercive measures, States Parties are required to provide assistance even when dual criminality is absent subject only to the basic concepts of their legal systems. Chapter IV also contains other innovative provisions designed to facilitate international cooperation. For example, States Parties that use UNCAC as a basis for extradition shall not consider corruption-related offences as political ones; assistance can also be provided in relation to offences for which legal persons can be held responsible; and bank secrecy cannot be cited as a ground to refuse a request for assistance. In order to ensure speedy and efficient cooperation, each State Party is required to designate a central authority responsible for receiving MLA requests. Overall, Chapter IV provides a broad and flexible platform for international cooperation. However, its provisions do not exhaust all international cooperation issues covered by UNCAC, thus the purposes of UNCAC and provisions of other chapters also need to be taken into consideration.|$|E

40|$|Asset Recovery as The Results of Criminal Act of Corruption (Stolen Asset Recovery) {{which is}} stored by corruptors {{overseas}} {{can be done}} through Mutual Cooperation between Nations or the so-called Mutual Legal Assistance, which {{is a form of}} international cooperation in combating crime which character is transnational, not only corruption, but also terrorism and illegal drug trafficking (drugs), as well as through bilateral and multilateral agreements on extradition. In the fight against corruption which character is transnational where an asset of corruption in nation that is stored in another nation, it takes mutual cooperation between nations. In United Nations Convention Against Corruption in 2003 mentioned the mutual cooperation between nations at the provision of assets infomation, asset freeze until the state asset recovery as the result of criminal act of corruption. The usage of Mutual Legal Assistance is more practical, because it does not need prior agreement between nations such as extradition treaty.
