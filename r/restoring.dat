50|$|In System <b>Restore,</b> {{the user}} may {{create a new}} <b>restore</b> point {{manually}} (as opposed to the system creating one automatically), roll back to an existing <b>restore</b> point, or change the System <b>Restore</b> configuration. Moreover, the <b>restore</b> itself can be undone. Old <b>restore</b> points are discarded {{in order to keep}} the volume's usage within the specified amount. For many users, this can provide <b>restore</b> points covering the past several weeks. Users concerned with performance or space usage may also opt to disable System <b>Restore</b> entirely. Files stored on volumes not monitored by System <b>Restore</b> are never backed up or <b>restored.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Restore</b> from Repository - Monitored {{files and}} {{operating}} system configurations are automatically <b>restored</b> to a prior baseline without needing user intervention. The <b>Restore</b> from Repository mode <b>restores</b> operating system/configuration changes using stored authoritative files.|$|R
50|$|In Windows XP, {{there are}} some {{improvements}} made to System <b>Restore</b> compared to Windows Me. System <b>Restore</b> uses a copy-on-write file system filter driver for taking snapshots. In Windows XP, System <b>Restore</b> is configurable per volume and the data stores are also stored per volume. On NTFS volumes, the <b>Restore</b> Points are stored using NTFS compression and protected using ACLs. A Disk Cleanup handler allows deleting {{all but the most}} recent <b>Restore</b> Point. Besides the Registry hives and system files, COM+ and WMI databases and the IIS metabase can also be <b>restored.</b> System <b>Restore</b> supports Group Policy. System <b>Restore</b> in Windows XP also works without issues with EFS-encrypted files.|$|R
5|$|In addition, {{it is in}} {{the process}} of <b>restoring</b> the video footage and has {{released}} a preview of key moments.|$|E

5|$|The latest {{renovation}} of the cathedral began in 2012, {{with a focus on}} strengthening and <b>restoring</b> the dome and the roof.|$|E
5000|$|System <b>Restore</b> is now {{based on}} Shadow Copy {{technology}} {{instead of a}} file-based filter and is therefore more proactive at creating useful <b>restore</b> points. <b>Restore</b> points are now [...] "volume-level", meaning that performing a <b>restore</b> will capture the state of an entire system {{at a point in}} time. These can also be <b>restored</b> using the Windows Recovery Environment when booting from the Windows Vista DVD, and an [...] "undo" [...] <b>restore</b> point can be created prior to a <b>restore,</b> in case a user wishes to return to the pre-restored state.|$|R
5000|$|Yang Xianrong (created 300, deposed, <b>restored,</b> deposed again, <b>restored</b> again 304, deposed again, <b>restored</b> again, deposed again 305, <b>restored</b> 306), later {{captured}} by Liu Yao of Han Zhao {{and made his}} empress after he became emperor in 318 ...|$|R

5|$|After the storm, the {{government}} of Somaliland distributed rice, sugar, and plastic sheets for housing. After Chapala and the subsequent Cyclone Megh, the local Red Cross chapter distributed blankets, sleeping mats, and mattresses to the affected families. The CARE relief agency provided US$300,000 toward <b>restoring</b> water and relief goods.|$|E
5|$|All of SH-8 between Randlett and Cyril {{was once}} again dropped on 1966-05-09, <b>restoring</b> the route to its current {{southern}} terminus at US-277/SH-19 in Cyril. No major changes to the highway have occurred since 1966.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with several}} {{official}} patches, a fan-released unofficial patch by a modding community fixed around 500 remaining bugs, along with <b>restoring</b> {{most of the}} content that was cut from the game. There were also methods found by the community for improving compatibility on modern PC operating systems.|$|E
50|$|Data is <b>restored</b> from disk if possible. But if {{the data}} exists only on tape it is <b>restored</b> {{directly}} (no backward-staging on <b>restore).</b>|$|R
50|$|For data {{integrity}} purposes, System <b>Restore</b> {{does not allow}} other applications or users to modify or delete files in the directory where the <b>restore</b> points are saved. On NTFS volumes, the <b>Restore</b> Points are protected using ACLs. Since its method of backup is fairly simplistic, it may end up archiving malware such as viruses, for example in a <b>restore</b> point created before using antivirus software to clean an infection. Antivirus software is usually unable to remove infected files from System Restore; the only way actually to delete the infected files is to disable System <b>Restore,</b> which will result in losing all saved <b>restore</b> points; otherwise they will remain until Windows deletes the affected <b>restore</b> points. However stored infected files in themselves are harmless unless executed; they will only pose a threat if the affected <b>restore</b> point is reinstated. Windows System <b>Restore</b> is not compatible with <b>restore</b> points made by third party applications.|$|R
30|$|The {{survival}} data of implants <b>restored</b> with single crowns are {{slightly higher than}} <b>restored</b> with fixed partial dentures than <b>restore</b> with full dentures (Fig.  7).|$|R

5|$|Astrid ran aground off {{the coast}} of Ireland on 24 July 2013, and {{subsequently}} sank, with all on board rescued. She was salvaged on 9 September 2013, but as the cost of <b>restoring</b> her was too high she was scrapped and broken up by April 2014.|$|E

5|$|Power workers {{immediately}} began repairing the power failures by clearing tree branches and replacing fuses and circuit breakers. Peco energy <b>restored</b> power to 72% {{of the affected}} customers by {{two days after the}} storm, with 85% <b>restored</b> by two nights. By two days after the storm, Pennsylvania Power and Light <b>restored</b> power to about 80% of its impacted customers, with about 93% <b>restored</b> by two nights after the storm.

50|$|On {{the basis}} of her suit’s success, other tribes {{throughout}} California began fighting for recognition and restoration by the federal government. Though there had been 6 termination reversals prior to Tillie Hardwick v. United States none had as far reaching an effect. The Robinson Rancheria was <b>restored</b> 22 March 1977; the Hopland Rancheria was <b>restored</b> 29 March 1978; The Upper Lake Rancheria was <b>restored</b> 15 May 1979; the Table Bluff Rancheria was <b>restored</b> 21 September 1981; the Big Sandy Rancheria was <b>restored</b> 28 March 1983; and the Table Mountain Rancheria was <b>restored</b> in June, 1983.

50|$|The first {{successful}} challenge {{was for the}} Robinson Rancheria which was 22 March 1977 and {{it was followed by}} 5 others: the Hopland Rancheria was <b>restored</b> 29 March 1978; The Upper Lake Rancheria was <b>restored</b> 15 May 1979; the Table Bluff Rancheria was <b>restored</b> 21 September 1981; the Big Sandy Rancheria was <b>restored</b> 28 March 1983; and the Table Mountain Rancheria was <b>restored</b> in June, 1983.

5|$|In 1902, the {{commission}} submitted a threefold plan of {{proposal to the}} government. First, the immediate dangers should be avoided by resetting the corners, removing stones that endangered the adjacent parts, strengthening the first balustrades and <b>restoring</b> several niches, archways, stupas and the main dome. Second, after fencing off the courtyards, proper maintenance should be provided and drainage should be improved by <b>restoring</b> floors and spouts. Third, all loose stones should be removed, the monument cleared {{up to the first}} balustrades, disfigured stones removed and the main dome restored. The total cost was estimated at that time around 48,800 Dutch guilders.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{renovation}} of North Philadelphia subway station was completed. This included <b>restoring</b> the Glenwood Avenue headhouses, closed for decades before, which improved {{connections to the}} mainline station.|$|E
50|$|System <b>Restore</b> also {{suffered}} from a bug in the date-stamping functionality that could cause System <b>Restore</b> to date-stamp snapshots that were taken after 8 September 2001 incorrectly. This could prevent System <b>Restore</b> from locating these snapshots and cause the system <b>restore</b> process to fail. Microsoft released an update to fix this problem.|$|R

Canopy trees {{were the main}} source of {{similarity}} in the unrestored age class, while medium shrubs and immature trees were the main source in the <b>restored</b> classes.|$|R
