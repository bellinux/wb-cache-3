An elevated gallery lines the north wall facing the pews which are bisected by 3½ ft (1.1 m) tall, 5 in (13cm) wide beaded board partition. The pews, partition, door, and window trim are all hand grained. The interior walls are covered with 6 in (15cm) pine wainscotting. The original iron stoves have been replaced with oil-burning stoves, set into the original flues.|$|E

That <b>room,</b> <b>like</b> several others, has a large window set back into an arch, as viewed from the interior. Another ground floor room also has a deep, decorative plaster cornice, but no decoration on the ceiling.|$|E
25|$|The {{stage is}} split into three sections, each {{a room of}} the Rodales' house: Mal and Jill's bedroom, the kitchen, and the living <b>room.</b> <b>Like</b> the setting used in Bedroom Farce and Private Fears in Public Places, scene changes are {{controlled}} by switching the lighting from one area of the stage to the other. However, in a setting unique to this play, the whole stage {{is also used to}} represent the showroom floor at Mal's place of work.|$|E

25|$|Along the {{southwest}} {{side of the}} peristyle, is the 2nd largest room in the Palace, the cenatio (or Triclinium) or Banqueting <b>Room.</b> <b>Like</b> the Aula Regia, it was extravagantly decorated, with several tiers of columns in exotic marbles and a frieze. It opened onto two courtyards with oval fountains {{to the north and}} south visible from the windows of the dining room. The centre of the southern wall of the hall has an apse surrounded by two passages which allow access to the library of the temple of Apollo. The floor of the hall is covered with marble concealing a hypocaust whose bricks date from the reign of Maxentius. This heating system suggests that this hall served as a banqueting hall in the winter and has been identified with the Cenatio Iovis mentioned in ancient literary sources.|$|E
25|$|SNL {{writers are}} often also {{performers}} or experienced {{in writing and}} improvisational comedy. Many are hired from similar backgrounds such as The Groundlings, Second City, Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre, and ImprovOlympic. Comedian Jim Downey was head writer for nine years beginning in 1985. Experienced writers with backgrounds in television shows are also sometimes brought into the SNL writing <b>room.</b> <b>Like</b> the SNL cast that step before the cameras, many of the writers {{have been able to}} find their own success outside the show such as Conan O'Brien, who was brought into SNL from The Groundlings, went on to writing for The Simpsons, and eventually began hosting his own show, and former head writer Adam McKay who, along with performer Ferrell, founded the successful comedy website Funny or Die. In 2000, Tina Fey became the first female SNL head writer and successfully made the transition to starring on the show, as well as writing and starring in feature films, and ultimately creating and starring in her own show 30 Rock—partly based on her SNL experiences. In 2005, Fey was being paid $1.5million per season for her dual role as head writer and performer.|$|E
25|$|The {{art gallery}} was another extravagance of Strousberg's for {{the display of}} his {{painting}} and sculpture collection. East of the gallery, the Billiards room provided a convenient entertaining room, which led back through the walnut paneled dining room to either the drawing room or into the library. Above the library's panelling, which was again carved from walnut, were murals and a skylight set into the ceiling. At night this <b>room,</b> <b>like</b> the others, was lit by gas light. The rest of the Palais's ground floor accommodation served as anterooms and work rooms for the Ambassador. Above the small windows of the Servants' quarters in the basement; {{the windows of the}} great hall, its anteroom and the portrait gallery, stood more than 3 metres tall, overlooking and visually connected the rooms with each other and the gardens in the large courtyard. The facades that faced onto this courtyard were given a unifying treatment with Corinthian columns dividing the glazing. Originally it was open to the west, where a curved terrace opened onto a garden. Its location can still be discerned in the plan of the basement. Its plan shape can still be discerned in the plan of the basement. The terrace was adjacent to the garden of the Palais Redern and effectively extended the small garden of the Palais Strousberg into the generous garden of the Palais Redern.|$|E

500|$|In casting his nine-member crew, Whedon looked {{first at}} the actors and {{considered}} their chemistry with others. Cast member Sean Maher recalls, [...] "So then he just sort of put us all together, and I {{think it was very}} quick, like right out of the gate, we all instantly bonded". All nine cast members were chosen before filming began. However, while filming the original pilot [...] "Serenity", Whedon decided that Rebecca Gayheart was unsuitable for the role of Inara Serra, and shot her scenes in singles so that {{it would be easier to}} replace her. Morena Baccarin auditioned for the role and two days later was on the set in her first television show. [...] "Joss brought me down from the testing <b>room</b> <b>like</b> a proud dad, holding my hand and introducing me," [...] Baccarin recalled.|$|E

On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without rest. Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 a.m.: [...] "I was sleeping in my <b>room</b> <b>like</b> one dead... Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me... spoke animatedly, with pauses, ... work out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution, he suddenly closed the telephone." ...|$|E

Many sources, including Lichtenstein himself only include four works in the series (excluding Artist's Studio/A Still Life, 1973). In a 1995 lecture in conjunction with the Kyoto Prize, he said [...] "I did a series of four large, about 8' x10', paintings of interiors of artists' studios. They were inspired by Matisse's paintings..." [...] Artist's Studio—Look Mickey is regarded as the first of the four Artist's Studio works.

There, he finds a note, written in the series' Standard Galactic Alphabet cypher, from the final boss of the Vorticons trilogy: his school rival Mortimer McMire, whose IQ is [...] "a single point higher" [...] than Keen's. The note tells Keen that the McMire killed in the previous game was an android replica, that the [...] "Gannalech" [...] is a mispronunciation of [...] "Grand Intellect", his title from the first trilogy, and that the Armageddon Machine was itself a distraction, as McMire plans on destroying the universe instead.

500|$|The {{theme song}} for Homicide: Life on the Street was {{composed}} by Lynn F. Kowal, who submitted {{one of several}} tapes sent to the producers for consideration. Homicide producers initially had trouble finding the right song, and Levinson ultimately chose Kowal's themes because, {{while most of the}} candidates too closely resembled typical television theme songs, Levinson felt Kowal's song [...] "had that odd quality to it, drums or whatever, and it was very unusual". Music is presented in various ways throughout the first season of Homicide. Some songs are played on radios that play in the homicide squad <b>room,</b> <b>like</b> [...] "Lay Down My Life" [...] by Carole King, [...] "Texas Slide" [...] by Jean-Jacques Milteau, [...] "N.Y.C (Can You Believe This City?)" [...] by Charles & Eddie, [...] "Little Boy Blues" [...] and [...] "Break Up" [...] by , and [...] "Tropic Call" [...] by Mitchell Coodley and Andrew Snitzer, all of which are featured in [...] "Night of the Dead Living".
