In this paper active power variation-based protection for HIGFs is developed, and a dissipation factor (DF) -based criterion for identifying load-switching operation is proposed. They are implemented by cross-correlation analysis between phase voltage and residual current in single-phase networks. A digital protection scheme is also designed.

40|$|This Master {{thesis is}} based on {{problems}} of force effects of the magnetic field of short-circuit current. Firstly, I analysed the force action of the three phase busbars during the three-pole short circuit. The analysis was performed in the Ansys Maxwell program and I verified the correctness of the analysis by numerical calculation. The second practical part was executed for ABB company. The main task was to analyse the force effects of the short-circuit current in the HV switchgear with focusing on the arms and contact system of the <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker.</b> The simulations of the following configurations were performed in more details: three configurations of the simplified VD 4 <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker,</b> two types of VD 4 circuit-breaker contact systems and a linear <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> configuration model. The objective was to calculate the forces acting on the current path of the arms and contact system of the VD 4 <b>circuit</b> <b>breaker</b> during the three-phase short-circuit and to simulate the effects of forces on these current parts. For modelling of individual assemblies, calculations and simulations I used: SolidWorks 2014, Ansys Maxwell 16. 0 and Ansys Workbench 14. 5 programs. With SolidWorks 2014 3 D CAD software were modelled simplified assemblies of <b>circuit</b> <b>breakers</b> and contact systems.
