5|$|Although {{credited}} {{with the development of}} the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to <b>refine</b> <b>the</b> breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters. Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties. The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1973, several {{spacecraft}} {{have performed}} planetary flyby maneuvers {{that brought them}} within observation range of Jupiter. The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive in that environment. The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to <b>refine</b> <b>the</b> mass estimates of the Jovian system.

5|$|In 1955, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin {{detected}} {{bursts of}} radio signals coming from Jupiter at 22.2MHz.

Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) that had a duration of less than a hundredth of a second.|$|E

Nakashima's duties included doing very explicit detail drawings showing, for example, the design of the concrete formwork.

Instead, when the next EBRC was appointed, its terms of reference would instruct the Committee to plan for fewer six-member GRCs than at present, and to reduce the average size of each GRC. The average size of GRCs at that time was 5.4 MPs because there were only five-member and six-member GRCs. The new average, however, would not exceed five MPs.|$|E
5|$|The Avro Vulcan (later Hawker Siddeley Vulcan from July 1963) is a jet-powered {{tailless}} {{delta wing}} high-altitude strategic bomber, which was {{operated by the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1956 until 1984. Aircraft manufacturer A.V. Roe and Company (Avro) designed the Vulcan in response to Specification B.35/46. Of the three V bombers produced, the Vulcan was considered the most technically advanced and hence the riskiest option. Several scale aircraft, designated Avro 707, were produced to test and <b>refine</b> <b>the</b> delta wing design principles.|$|E
5|$|To {{identify}} the optimal {{spatial and temporal}} distribution of radiation sources within the applicators of the implanted tissue or cavity, the treatment planning software allows virtual radiation sources to be placed within the virtual patient. The software shows a graphical representation {{of the distribution of}} the irradiation. This serves as a guide for the brachytherapy team to <b>refine</b> <b>the</b> distribution of the sources and provide a treatment plan that is optimally tailored to the anatomy of each patient before actual delivery of the irradiation begins. This approach is sometimes called ‘dose-painting’.|$|E

It received praise for its story and battle system, while criticisms have focused on its HD upgrade and localization.|$|E
