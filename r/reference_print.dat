This research proposes to assess the strength of evidence associated with pores when shown in (dis) agreement between a mark and a <b>reference</b> <b>print.</b> Based upon an algorithm designed to automatically detect pores, a metric is defined in order to compare different impressions. From this metric, the weight of the findings is quantified using a likelihood ratio. The results obtained on four configurations and 54 donors show the significant contribution of the pore features and translate into statistical terms what latent fingerprint examiners have developed holistically through experience. The system provides LRs that are indicative of the true state under both the prosecution and the defense propositions. Not only such a system brings transparency regarding the weight to assign to such features, but also forces a discussion in relation to the risks of such a model to mislead...|$|E
40|$|The {{role of a}} color-managed inkjet {{proof is}} to predict and {{simulate}} the visual appearance of printed color. The proof-to-print visual match works well under different viewing conditions when the input ICC profile and the output ICC profile, built from characterization datasets, do not contain optical brightening agents (OBA). OBAs influence printed color when measured for characterization and viewed. These brightening agents absorb UV wavelengths in the illuminant and fluoresce in the blue wavelengths. As more and more OBAs are used in printing paper production, the role of color proofing becomes more difficult. The difference {{in the amount of}} the UV component of the measuring and viewing light sources cause a problem where the OBA effect, as measured, may not be the same amount of OBA effect that should be proofed under the viewing illuminant. There are two objectives in this research project. The first objective is to show how printed colors, under identical printing conditions on OBA and non-OBA substrates, look different than when they are proofed using current characterization for proofing practices. Both M 0 (UV-included) and M 2 (UV-cut) measurement data are collected from color patches with selected tonal values and input ICC profiles created from this data are used to proof the brightened <b>reference</b> <b>print.</b> The results show that the UV-cut characterization treatment produces a very poor proof to the reference, while the UV-included proof was ranked as a fairly high match. A third commercially available software designed to improve upon the UV-included treatment, the X-Rite Optical Brightened Compensation module, was also tested and found to be a good match to the reference as well. The second objective is to propose different ways the characterization data can be adjusted for the OBAs in a <b>reference</b> <b>print</b> on brightened paper, by accounting for the influence of UV in the measurement illuminant, and the influence of UV in the viewing illuminant. By means of psychometric analyses, the results show that (1) the proof-to- print match is the worst when OBA in print and UV in the measurement illuminant are not addressed (UV-cut characterization data from M 2); (2) although not conclusive, the proof-to-print match improves when OBA in print, UV in the measurement illuminant (characterization data from M 0), and UV in the viewing illuminant are addressed...|$|E
40|$|Ten years ago, {{the notion}} that a top {{academic}} journal should publish an exchange on the sci-entific validation of fingerprint evidence would have been a non-starter. Until then, all but a few self-interested defendants and defence attorneys believed that when a fingerprint examiner matched a crime scene print (a latent print) to a suspect’s <b>reference</b> <b>print,</b> the evidence was absolute and irrefutable. A fingerprint match proved identity if not guilt. Today, however, scientists, attorneys and others are taking {{a hard look at the}} forensic sciences in general and fingerprint evidence in particular. The oft-repeated claims that fingerprints are unique and that the source of fingerprint fragments can be identified with certainty have received special attention. Balding (2005), Cole (2004) and Saks & Koehler (2008) argue against the uniqueness claim both in theory and in practice. Kaye (2003) points out the serious flaws in a study that some rely on as proof of fingerprint uniqueness. As for the certainty of fingerprint identifications, the data (not surprisingly) show that fingerprint examiners are fallible. Many commit false-positive and false-negative errors in proficiency tests and in casework (Cole, 2005, 2006). Indeed, some critics argue that there is no scientific reason to believe that fingerprint examiners can make reliable identifications at all (Epstein, 2002) ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{newspaper}} printing industry, offset is the dominating printing method {{and the use}} of multicolour printing has increased rapidly in newspapers during the last decade. The offset printing process relies on the assumption that an uniform film of ink of right thickness is transferred onto the printing areas. The quality of reproduction of colour images in offset printing is dependent on a number of parameters in a chain of steps and in the end it is the amount and the distribution of ink deposited on the substrate that create the sensation and thus the perceived colours. We identify three control points in the offset printing process and present methods for assessing the printing process quality in two of these points: • Methods for determining if the printing plates carry the correct image • Methods for determining the amount of ink deposited onto the newsprint A new concept of colour impression is introduced as a measure of the amount of ink deposited on the newsprint. Two factors contribute to values of the colour impression, the halftone dot-size and ink density. Colour impression values are determined on gray-bars using a CCD-camera based system. Colour impression values can also be determined in an area containing an arbitrary combination of cyan magenta and yellow inks. The correct amount of ink is known either from a <b>reference</b> <b>print</b> or from prepress information. Thus, the deviation of the amount of ink can be determined that can be used as control value by a press operator or as input to a control system. How a closed loop controller can be designed based on the colour impression values is also shown. It is demonstrated that the methods developed can be used for off-line print quality monitoring and ink feed control, or preferably in an online system in a newspaper printing press.

40|$|Latent {{fingerprints}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} important and widely used evidence in law enforcement and forensic agencies worldwide. Yet, NIST evaluations show that the performance of state-of-the-art latent recognition systems is far from satisfactory. An automated latent fingerprint recognition system with high accuracy is essential to compare latents found at crime scenes to a large collection of reference prints to generate a candidate list of possible mates. In this paper, we propose an automated latent fingerprint recognition algorithm that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) for ridge flow estimation and minutiae descriptor extraction, and extract complementary templates (two minutiae templates and one texture template) to represent the latent. The comparison scores between the latent and a <b>reference</b> <b>print</b> based on the three templates are fused to retrieve a short candidate list from the reference database. Experimental results show that the rank- 1 identification accuracies (query latent is matched with its true mate in the reference database) are 64. 7 % for the NIST SD 27 and 75. 3 % for the WVU latent databases, against a reference database of 100 K rolled prints. These results are the best among published papers on latent recognition and competitive with the performance (66. 7 % and 70. 8 % rank- 1 accuracies on NIST SD 27 and WVU DB, respectively) of a leading COTS latent Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS). By score-level (rank-level) fusion of our system with the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) latent AFIS, the overall rank- 1 identification performance can be improved from 64. 7 % and 75. 3 % to 73. 3 % (74. 4 %) and 76. 6 % (78. 4 %) on NIST SD 27 and WVU latent databases, respectively...|$|E
