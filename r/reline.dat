The theoretical part of this report is based on relevant information provided from companies, previous studies, investigations and reports within the area.

40|$|Background/Aim. Tooth loss affects oral {{health-related}} life quality. More than a {{third of}} edentulous patients are not fully satisfied with their complete dentures and mainly complain of insufficient stability, retention, and pain during mastication. Solving the problem may include <b>relining</b> by materials that are based on silicone or acrylic. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the level of patients’ satisfaction before and after <b>relining</b> upper dentures with soft and rigid liners. Methods. The patients (n = 24) were divided into two study groups. Maxillary denture <b>relining</b> of the first group of patients was performed with hard acrylic based resins while in the second group of patients complete denture was <b>relined</b> with a silicone-based soft liner. They were asked the questions from the specifically adapted the Oral Health Impact Profile Questionnaire for edentulous patients before and three months after <b>relining</b> dentures. Results. After <b>relining</b> the patients showed a higher degree of satisfaction with their dentures in all the tested domains (masticatory function, psychological discomfort, social disability and retention and hygiene). The patients with soft denture <b>relines</b> were more satisfied. Conclusion. <b>Relining</b> of maxillary complete dentures significantly positively impacts the quality of life of patients in all the tested domains (masticatory function, psychological discomfort, social disability, pain and oral hygiene).

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} changes in {{distraction}} force following <b>relining</b> of a conventional abdominal aortic stent-graft with a type IIIb endoleak using the Nellix endovascular sealing device compared to a unilateral stent-graft. Methods: <b>Relining</b> {{is often used to}} repair type IIIb endoleaks, but the consequences to graft stability are unknown. A mathematical model was constructed based on pressure and volume flow through the stent-grafts, incorporating recognized distraction force equations. Steady flow was presumed at peak systolic pressures to calculate the maximum distraction force, with gravity ignored. Distraction forces for 28 - to 36 -mm-diameter stent-graft bodies with 16 -mm limbs were calculated and compared to forces following <b>relining</b> with single and double Nellix devices or the Renu unilateral device. Results: Distraction forces for the 28 -, 32 -, and 36 -mm stent-grafts prior to <b>relining</b> were 5. 99, 10. 21, and 14. 99 N, respectively. Similar forces were reported after <b>relining</b> with bilateral Nellix devices (5. 86, 10. 08, and 14. 86 N, respectively). However, use of a unilateral Nellix increased the distraction forces to 9. 92, 14. 14, and 18. 92 N, respectively. These were comparable to the increase observed after <b>relining</b> with a Renu unilateral stent-graft (9. 87, 14. 09, and 18. 86 N, respectively).

40|$|Objectives: To {{report a}} series of {{patients}} following thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) presenting with rupture, who were effectively treated with TEVAR <b>relining.</b> Methods: Five patients who underwent repeat TEVAR in an urgent fashion were identified.

All patients had 3 device components originally placed. Mean size of the original aneurysm was 7. 2 cm (range 6. 6 - 8).

Design/methodology/approach: Stresses levels in material of denture saddles bearing structure have beendetermined for any cases where alveolar ridges of mandible are well preserved. This research has been carried outin simulated conditions of biting loads, {{by means of a}} FEM. Compared were not-relined vs. <b>relined</b> saddles for twovariants of bottom denture saddles margins, i. e. ended smoothly and with an extension that increases the amount ofmaterial of the bearing structure. Analyzed was also the influence on deformability of <b>relining</b> layers. Findings: Equivalent Huber-Misses stresses on a good saddles surface {{in case of}} a not-relined denture haveslightly exceeded the level of 2 MPa, whereas in case of a <b>relined</b> denture with a soft margin they have reached 4 MPa; and for variant of <b>relined</b> denture with extended margin they reached a level of 14 MPa.

40|$|One of the {{clinically}} relevant problems dentists {{face when}} restoring endodontically treated teeth is the mismatch between fiber post and post space diameters, {{which results in}} an excessively thick resin cement layer. Fiber post <b>relining</b> appears as a solution for this problem. OBJECTIVES: The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of fiber post <b>relining</b> with composite resin on push-out bond strength. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty bovine incisors were selected to assess post retention. The crowns were removed below the cementoenamel junction and the root canals were treated endodontically and flared with diamond burs. The roots were allocated into two groups (n= 10) : G 1 : fiber posts without <b>relining</b> and G 2 : fiber posts <b>relined</b> with composite resin. The posts were cemented with a dual-cured resin cement and the specimens were sectioned transversally. Three 1. 5 -mm thick slabs were obtained per root and identified as cervical, medium and apical thirds. The push-out test was performed at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min until post dislodgement occurred. The failure mode of fractured specimens was analyzed under scanning electron microscopy. Data were analyzed by split-plot ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey's test at a pre-set alpha of 0. 05. RESULTS: <b>Relined</b> fiber posts presented higher retention values than non-relined post in all thirds. No statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) were found among thirds for <b>relined</b> posts. All failures occurred at the interface between resin cement and root dentin.

40|$|Purpose: Durability {{tests of}} {{materials}} <b>relining</b> dentures should {{be carried out}} in conditions reflecting the realloading that accompanies bite force transmission. The influence of geometry resulting from a denture foundationshape on real stresses in <b>relining</b> has not been so far found. Design/methodology/approach: Using FEM modeling, identified were the stress levels in <b>relining</b> layers inconditions reflecting biting loading for two opposite cases of bone foundation atrophy. Findings: The equivalent Huber-Mises` stresses have not reached their critical values, although tangentialstresses on the interfacial where <b>relining</b> is bonded with denture base have reached 440 kPa, which, for some of thecommercial types of <b>relining</b> denotes the bonding strength. Research limitations/implications: The linear elastic mechanical characteristics were assumed. Hence,during further research, taken into account should be the “stiffening” of characteristics in the upper loadings range,which is typical for silicones. Practical implications: In case of a convex foundation the biggest danger will be caused by any bond defectsoccurring in the central area because in that area shear of bond has reached the highest values. Originality/value: Values of stresses components identified in this paper reflect the real shear conditions ofrelining bonding with denture base and might constitute a determinant for strength tests...|$|R
