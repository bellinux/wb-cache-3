5|$|The band is {{organized}} quite simply with Paul and Joe playing their songs {{in a simple}} basic guitar-synth-and-drums indie pop style and they sing in the semi-deadpan way; a review found the vocal delivery {{similar to that of}} They Might Be Giants. The <b>raison</b> d’être of the band is to put enough energy and spirit into their songs to make them fun.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} of the eastern areas of the Roman Empire from the Persians once again raised the problem of religious unity centering on {{the understanding of the}} true nature of Christ. Most of the inhabitants of these provinces were Monophysites who rejected the Council of Chalcedon. Heraclius tried to promote a compromise doctrine called Monothelitism but this philosophy was rejected as heretical by both sides of the dispute. For this reason, Heraclius was viewed as a heretic and bad ruler by some later religious writers. After the Monophysite provinces were finally lost to the Muslims, Monotheletism rather lost its <b>raison</b> d'être and was eventually abandoned.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{series of}} the BBC espionage {{television}} series Spooks (known as MI-5 in the United States) began broadcasting on 27 October 2008 on BBC One before ending on 8 December 2008 on the same channel, and consists of eight episodes, two fewer than previous series. It follows the actions of Section D, a counter-terrorism division in MI5.

5|$|The {{theme of}} Shiva as a beggar {{is not unique}} to the Bhikshatana icon and his legends. Shiva is often {{described}} as wandering the universe as a homeless beggar-ascetic with his consort Parvati's <b>raison</b> d'être being to bring him back to his marital and home life. Shiva is also depicted as asking for alms from the goddess Annapurna, a form of Parvati as the goddess of food. The Satarudriya describes Shiva as gathering food through begging, evocative of his Bhikshatana form. In spite of this he is described as a sustainer of the universe and of life-sustaining food.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} {{from one of the}} F-16's original <b>raison</b> d'etre recent costs for both new and refurbished aircraft have risen significantly from its 1998 fly-away cost of $18.8 million. In 2011, Iraq ordered 18 F-16IQ (Block 52) for $3 billion, an average cost of $165 million per unit. In 2014, the United Arab Emirates ordered 30 F-16s Block 60 aircraft with the average cost of $200 million. In 2017, Romania purchased 12 refurbished used F-16A/Bs from Portugal for a total of €628 million, roughly $680 million, an average cost of $56 million. This cost led the Polish deputy minister for national defence Bartosz Kownacki to counsel against buying used F-16s, saying that buying a new F-35 would be better value. In March 2017, the US government released plans to sell 19 new F-16s with 23 engines, radars, and armament to Bahrain for total cost of $4.867 billion.|$|E
5|$|Penry-Jones {{announced}} {{his intention to}} leave the series in December 2007, while it was later announced Armitage would join. Norris and <b>Raison</b> were both asked to return after their characters were left open for return {{after the end of}} the last series. In developing the series, the producers wanted to repeat the serialised style from series six, and settled on using the resurgence of Russia as the primary storyline, as they felt that at the time, the resurgence is in subtle ways threatening the security of the west. The producers also participated in several meetings with the writers to discuss the purpose of Sugarhorse. Filming started in London in March 2008, and later finished on August in the same year, in Moscow, the first time in series history where Spooks was filmed outside the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode is}} set {{six months after}} the series six finale, where Jo Portman (Miranda <b>Raison)</b> and Adam Carter were kidnapped by the Redbacks, a {{mercenary}} group known for kidnapping intelligence officers and selling them to be tortured. At the end of the episode, Jo appears to have been killed by Adam to spare her from the torture before they could be rescued. However, in a flashback it is revealed Jo played dead before rescue teams arrived, and later beats her kidnapper, Boscard (Gus Gallagher), to death. At first undecided, {{towards the end of the}} episode Jo returns to duty. In the meantime, Sir Harry Pearce secures the release of MI5 officer Lucas North, who was imprisoned in Russia for eight years.|$|E
5|$|Ben Kaplan (Alex Lanipekun) {{breaks into}} Meynell's office {{to learn of}} deals between Highland Life and Salma, a Russian bank that {{according}} to Elizabeta Starkova (Paloma Baeza), has connections with the Russian mafia. It is also revealed Highland Life owes Salma £65 billion. It was this reason that earlier in the episode, Denham committed suicide. In order to get Meynell to trust her {{to become part of}} his plan, Ros sleeps with him. Later, Calderwood receives a call from Asa Darlek (Stephen Noonan), Meynell's associate from Salma, and threatens to either have the £65 billion paid back, or he will go public to inform the country the true extent of its debts. Ros presents a third option; have Calderwood announce she will back Highland Life, {{while at the same time}} she will convince Meynell to bet against it. Such a plan would financially ruin Meynell. The next morning however, Darlek realises she is MI5 and threatens to kill her if Calderwood does not back down. Ros fights the gun off and Calderwood goes ahead with her statement. Later, Lucas releases Elizabeta as an asset. Meanwhile, Jo Portman (Miranda <b>Raison)</b> believes Boscard (Gus Gallagher), her captor from the end of series six, is still alive after seeing several hallucinations of him. Later, Ros puts her mind at rest when she shows Jo photographic evidence Boscard is indeed dead, and it was Jo who killed him.|$|E
