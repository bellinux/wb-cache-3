40|$|One of the {{purposes}} of receive filtering in a Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) handset receiver is to attenuate out-of-channel interference to provide channel selectivity. A UMTS handset receiver using a <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> adaptive on out-of-channel interfer- ence level can be more computationally efficient than a handset with a fixed <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> provided that the hand- set operates in low out-of-channel interference conditions often enough. The UMTS Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) test case requires the adaptive <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> to pro- vide a worst case ACS of 33 dB. An adaptive <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> is more computationally efficient than a fixed receive fil- ter when the required ACS is less than 23 dB, because the added complexity of measuring the out-of-channel interfer- ence is compensated for by the reduction in the required number of filter taps to achieve the ACS. Measurements of the out-of-channel interference show that currently the interference levels for which the maximum ACS of 33 dB is required are hardly ever reached in practice. For the currently measured interference levels an adaptive <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> will be computationally more efficient than a fixed <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> 97 % of the time. However, the current out-of-channel interference mea- surements might be on the optimistic side, because the loads of the UMTS networks are low.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the design and}} analysis of a filter at the receiver of a source coding system to mitigate the excess distortion caused due to channel errors. The index output by the source encoder is sent over a fading discrete binary symmetric channel and the possibly incorrect received index is mapped to the corresponding codeword by a Vector Quantization (VQ) decoder at the receiver. The output of the VQ decoder is then processed by a <b>receive</b> <b>filter</b> to obtain {{an estimate of the}} source instantiation.

30|$|Another {{approach}} {{to find the}} optimal transmit beamforming vectors is to directly solve the non-convex sum-rate problem [5, 9].

Using the MSE duality, the algorithm’s approach is to iterate between the optimization of the uplink power using geometric programming, uplink <b>receive</b> <b>filters,</b> and downlink <b>receive</b> <b>filters.</b> Different from [9], the approach in [5] was to establish the equivalence between the sum-rate maximization problem and the minimization of weighted sum MSE problem. Thus, the non-convex former problem can be solved via the latter by iteratively updating the weights, the <b>receive</b> <b>filters,</b> and the transmit filters. While both approaches in [5, 9] are capable of achieving at least a local optimum, they come with the drawback of high complexity due to the iterative optimization procedure.|$|R
