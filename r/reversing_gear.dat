25|$|Many of {{the class}} were fitted with cab signal equipment, the {{electronics}} for which were largely contained in a wood box affixed to the right-hand side running board {{in front of the}} <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> and aft of the smokebox.|$|E
25|$|The H class {{also became}} the first VR {{locomotive}} to feature a mechanical stoker, and boasted many other modern features such as roller bearings, hydrostatically controlled load compensating brake gear on the tender, power-operated <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> American-style bar frame construction, thermic siphons, and duplex blast pipes.|$|E
25|$|Development of {{a version}} for motor torpedo boats began in 1932 as the GM-34, {{but it did}} not pass its state tests until December 1934, {{although}} it was put into production that same year. It was given a <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> a free-wheel sleeve, and its cooling and exhaust systems were modified. Production continued through 1943 with the GM-34s adapting features from the aviation models. With the exception of the GAM-34BP and the original GM-34, all maritime engines used a benzene-alcohol fuel mixture.|$|E
50|$|In 1909, {{redesigned}} linkage in {{the transmission}} {{made it possible}} for the <b>reverse</b> <b>gear</b> to be activated with the regular gear-shift. Since 1904, all Packards had had a separate lever for the <b>reverse</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|The third type {{developed}} {{most recently}} and fitted to 7000series and 3000 Xtra machines has a wet master clutch, a six speed powershift section and a four speed range box. As reverse {{is at the}} front of the powershift section the <b>reverse</b> <b>gears</b> are spread throughout the speed range. This arrangement gives 24 forward gears (2x3x4) and 12 <b>reverse</b> <b>gears</b> (1x3x4). Note that the top three <b>reverse</b> <b>gears</b> are not available for use.|$|R

500|$|After 1903, a [...] {{frame with}} a longer {{overhang}} {{at the front}} end was introduced and steam <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> fitted. Some sources record these locomotives as X14 class, and this designation was sometimes {{used to refer to}} the longer-framed versions, but for most purposes the two sub-classes were grouped together and known as M7. The 1904/05 construction batch moved the sandboxes back to the front splasher and new items were feed water heating, single ram pumps and balanced crank axles. For the remainder of construction from the outshopping of the 105th locomotive in 1911, duplex pumps were fitted.|$|E
500|$|The {{ships were}} [...] long between perpendiculars, [...] long at the waterline, and [...] long overall. They had {{a beam of}} [...] and a draft of [...] At full load, the ships were to {{displace}} [...] The first four ships were equipped {{with a pair of}} steam turbines on the center shafts, without <b>reversing</b> <b>gear.</b> Normandie and Flandre had Parsons turbines, Gascogne had turbines built by Rateau-Bretagne, and Languedocs turbines were built by Schneider-Zoelly. The four ships had a pair of four-cylinder triple expansion engines for steaming astern or cruising at low speed. The last ship, Béarn, was equipped with four Parsons turbines. Normandie and Gascogne were given twenty-one Guyot du Temple small tube boilers, Flandre and Languedoc were equipped with twenty-eight Belleville small tube boilers, while Béarn had twenty-one Niclausse small tube boilers.|$|E

The man in the engine-room will break open the sea connections with a sledge-hammer, and will follow his leader into the water. This last step ensures the sinking of the Merrimac whether the torpedoes work or not. By this time I calculate the six men will be in the dingy and the Merrimac will have swung athwart the channel, to the full length of her three hundred yards of cable, which will have been paid out before the anchors are cut loose. Then, all that is left for me is to touch the button. I shall stand on the starboard side of the bridge. The explosion will throw the Merrimac on her starboard side. Nothing on this side of New York City will be able to raise her after that.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of articulated locomotives {{was a major}} impetus to the {{development of}} power reverse systems, because these typically had two or even three sets of reverse gear, instead of just one on a simple locomotive. [...] The Baldwin Locomotive Works used the Ragonnet <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> and other American builders generally abandoned positive locking features. In British use, locking cylinders remained in use. The Hadfield <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> patented in 1950, was in most particulars a Ragonnet <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> with added locking cylinder.Most Beyer Garratt locomotives used the Hadfield system.|$|E

50|$|In 1907 the {{locomotives}} were {{fitted with}} new domed boilers, replacing the domeless versions originally fitted. This increased their weight by 3 tons which improved their adhesion factor. Power <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> was fitted in 1922, making them {{the first class}} in New South Wales to be so fitted. It was a hydraulic type and was excellent when shunting at Sydney station, however this was only short lived and Johnson bar lever <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> was fitted shortly after.|$|E

50|$|During 1920, {{most of the}} fireboxes on {{the early}} orders of the Class 14C were restayed. The <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> was of the single {{cylinder}} type and tended to creep. Hendrie therefore fitted oil cylinders and installed his Hendrie <b>reversing</b> <b>gear,</b> which was manufactured in the Pretoria workshops during 1922. Modifications were also made to the finger bars and rocking grate cylinders of the firebox and to the sanding gear. Approximately 2 lt t of lead were run into the smokebox saddle casting to provide additional weight on the leading bogie.|$|E

50|$|The <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> was {{originally}} mechanical, but was replaced on {{all but two}} of the locomotives (nos. 1355/8) by steam-operated <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> between 1932 and 1934. The steam <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> was removed again between 1941 and 1947.In 1929, No. 1656 was moved to the newly built Whitemoor Yard at March, Cambridgeshire. In 1932, this locomotive was replaced by Nos. 1355 and 1358. Whitemoor preferred the ex-GCR 0-8-4T (LNER Class S1) for hump shunting, so in 1934 No 1358 was moved to Doncaster, and No. 1355 to Mexborough. In 1936, No. 1355 moved to King's Cross to shunt the engine shed for seven weeks, before joining No. 1358 in Doncaster. These two locomotives were scrapped at Doncaster in 1937. The remaining T1s continued to work coal trains at various docks and marshalling yards throughout North East England. After World War II, coal exports never returned to their pre-war levels. Hence, many of the T1s moved to other sheds for heavy shunting duties.|$|E

50|$|The Caprotti {{valve gear}} {{was driven by}} a single shaft, located between the frames, and driven from the leading coupled axle by a bevel gear. The <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> was {{operated}} by a screw wheel requiring multiple turns to go from full forward to full reverse; in this it differed from the standard Caprotti version, which only required one turn. It was designed {{to operate in the}} same way as the <b>reversing</b> <b>gear</b> on the Walschaerts-fitted Black Fives. However reversing between intermediate cutoff positions could only be achieved by winding to the full-gear position in the new direction and then winding back.|$|E

The first group however only allows {{the first and}} second gear to be engaged so that the total amount of gears is six; the gearbox lever has a {{six-speed}} H-layout. When shifting from second into third gear, the gearbox automatically switches from the first into the second group. The gearbox lacks a <b>reverse</b> <b>gear,</b> instead, the Unimog has a second gear lever for switching the driving direction. This lever is part of an additional <b>reverse</b> <b>gear</b> unit. When in reverse, due to the gearbox construction, only the first group of the gearbox, that can make use of the first two gears only, can be used. This results in two <b>reverse</b> <b>gears.</b>|$|R
