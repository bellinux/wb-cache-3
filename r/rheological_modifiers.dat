The primary objective was to find <b>rheological</b> <b>modifiers</b> when blended with this clay slurry that would provide a vane yield stress of 300 Pa when the slurry was undisturbed for 24 hours. A secondary objective {{was to find a}} modifier that after shearing would produce a Bingham Plastic yield stress of 30 Pa and plastic viscosity of 30 mPa-sec. Two parallel paths were chosen with one examining a variety of organic/inorganic modifiers and another using just the inorganic modifier Laponite (R). The addition of organic modifiers hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, and hydroxypropylcellulose at a target 0. 50 wt percent dramatically increased the vane yield stress over the range 311 - 724 Pa, and also increased the Bingham plastic yield stress and plastic viscosities over the range 33 - 112 Pa and 27 - 166 mPa-sec, respectively. The organic modifiers also showed elastic behavior, yielding a very unpredictable up flow curve. The 0. 50 wt percent addition of inorganic modifiers magnesium aluminum silicate and hydrate magnesium aluminum silicate only increased the vane yield stress to 36 - 46 Pa and had little impact on the Bingham Plastic parameters. A range of an inorganic (2 - 4 wt percent magnesium aluminum silicate) and combination of a range of an inorganic (2 - 3 wt percent magnesium aluminum silicate) and organic (0. 03 - 0. 05 wt percent sodium carboxymethylcellulose) modifiers were then tested. These results showed that the target vane yield stress could be obtained but the Bingham Plastic yield stress and plastic viscosity were 3 times too high. Reducing the organic modifier weight percent by a few hundredths, the Bingham Plastic yield stress could be obtained, but then the vane yield stress would be too low. The addition of Laponite (R) (synthetic lithium aluminum silicate) increased the vane yield stress of the clay slurry to values as high as 1500 Pa. However, the flow curve behavior for the laponite samples was not predictable and the secondary objective was dropped based on customer needs and time constraints. Ultimately a 3 -wt percent addition of Laponite (R) was chosen to produce a 600 Pa vane yield stress mixture...|$|E

Out ofall the methods available for pumping waxy crude oil, use of pour point depressant (PPD) is preferred economically. Optimization of PPD dosages can affect cost savings. Present study deals with the synthesis of copolymers of maleic anhydride and esters of n-alkyl alcohols with oleic acid and methacrylic acid. The resulted copolymers were esterified with two moles of fatty alcohol (C 19 H 36 O 3). They were characterized by IR spectroscopy and their molecular weights were determined by GPC. These polymeric diesters with pen-dant fatty chains were evaluated for their efficiency as pour point depressants and flow improvers on crude oil from Gandhar oil field (Gujarat, India).

40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of wormlike micelle solutions as <b>rheological</b> <b>modifiers</b> in many consumer products, the prediction of the behavior of these fluids has grown increasingly important in recent years. In this paper, the flow past a sphere falling at its terminal velocity through a column of a wormlike micelle solution is experimentally studied. The working fluid is an entangled wormlike micelle solution of 0. 05 mol/l cetyletrimethylammonium bromide and 0. 05 mol/l sodium salicylate dissolved in water. The rheology of the fluid is characterized in both shear and transient homogeneous uniaxial extension. Sphere-to-tube ratios of a/R = 0. 0625 and a/R = 0. 125 are investigated over a wide range of Deborah numbers. The drag on the sphere is initially found to decrease with increasing Deborah number because of shear thinning effects. As the Deborah number is increased, the establishment of a strong extensional flow {{in the wake of the}} sphere causes the drag to increase to a value larger than that of a Newtonian fluid with the same viscosity. At a critical Deborah number, the flow becomes unstable and fluctuations in the sedimentation velocity of the sphere are observed. Particle image velocity measurements are used to analyze the flow fields around the falling spheres. These measurements show the presence of a strong negative wake. For the unstable flows, the velocity flow field is observed to fluctuate between a negative and extended wake. Pointwise and full-field flow-induced birefringence measurements are used to track the evolution in the deformation of the wormlike micelle chains. Strong evidence is found that suggests that the flow instability is the result of a breakdown of the wormlike micelle network structure in the wake of the sphere. This breakdown is related to the filament rupture observed in the extensional rheology experiments...|$|E

The behaviour of this starch polymer was found to be strongly dosage-dependent: it acted as a thickener when the incorporated dosage was up to 0. 30 % of lime weight; conversely, above that dosage, it behaved as a plasticizer. The thickening effect took place because polymer molecules were adsorbed onto lime particles acting as a flocculant, as confirmed by zeta-potential and particle size distribution results.

40|$|For the {{solution}} processing of organic photovoltaics on an industrial scale, {{the exclusion of}} halogenated solvents is a necessity. However, the limited solubility of most semiconducting polymer/fullerene blends in non-halogenated solvents results in ink formulations with low viscosities which poses limitations {{to the use of}} roll-to-roll compatible deposition processes, such as inkjet printing. We propose to add polystyrene as a <b>rheological</b> <b>modifier</b> to increase the viscosity of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) non-halogenated inks. The printing and performance of P 3 HT/PCBM photoactive layer inks are characterized as a function of polystyrene concentration and three different molecular weights. Addition of 1 wt% polystyrene provided a near two-fold gain in viscosity, with the largest viscosity gains coming from the polymer with the highest molecular weight. However, this coincided with greater viscoelastic behavior, which reduced the jetting performance of the inks. Differences in solvent compatibility of the polystyrene/P 3 HT/PCBM ternary blend resulted in phase separation upon layer drying, whereby polystyrene segregated to the layer-air interface to form an isolated domain or network like topology. Nevertheless, a 1. 7 -fold increase in dynamic viscosity was obtained for devices with printed BHJ layers containing polystyrene at the expense of a 20 % reduction in OPV performance. The improved viscosity and good printing behavior achieved with small additions of polystyrene demonstrates its potential to overcome the limited viscosity resulting from typical non-halogenated ink formulations for semiconducting polymers. These results offer a step forward to the industrialization of inkjet printing as an effective deposition technique for functional layers of organic electronics...|$|R
30|$|Excellent {{drilling}} fluid techniques {{are one of}} the significant guaranteed measures to insure safety, quality, efficiency, and speediness of drilling operations. Drilling fluids are generally discarded after the completion of drilling operations and become waste, which can have a large negative impact on the environment. Drilling materials and additives together with drill cuttings, oil, and water constitute waste {{drilling fluid}}s, which ultimately are dumped onto soil, surface water, groundwater, and air. Environmental pollution is found to be a serious threat while drilling complex wells or high-temperature deep wells as these types of wells involve the use of oil-based drilling fluid systems and high-performance water-based drilling fluid systems. The preservation of the environment on a global level is now important as various organizations have set up initiatives to drive the usage of toxic chemicals as drilling fluid additives. This paper presents an approach where grass is introduced as a sustainable drilling fluid additive with no environmental problems. Simple water-based drilling fluids were formulated using bentonite, powdered grass, and water to analyze the rheological and filtration characteristics of the new drilling fluid. A particle size distribution test was conducted to determine the particle size of the grass sample by the sieve analysis method. Experiments were conducted on grass samples of 300, 90, and 35  μm to study the characteristics and behavior of the newly developed drilling fluid at room temperature. The results show that grass samples with varying particle sizes and concentrations may improve the viscosity, gel strength, and filtration of the bentonite drilling fluid. These observations recommend the use of grass as a <b>rheological</b> <b>modifier,</b> filtration control agent, and pH control agent to substitute toxic materials from drilling fluids.|$|R

However, the rheological adjustment of fresh SFRCC, which {{is very important in}} successful extrusion, has never been tackled satisfactorily. Cost effectiveness usually becomes the main issue in searching for new formulations. In this study, a review from literatures and real experiences is first given. Then followed are systematic experimental approaches in determining the rheological properties of fresh SFRCC. First the liquid phases of four popular <b>rheological</b> <b>modifiers</b> (CMC, CMHPC, Methocel and PAM) have been studied using a Carri-Med CSL 500 rheometer. The temperature and concentration influences have been investigated. Then two sets of self designed ram rheometries and the related mechanics have been utilized to find the key extrusion parameters and extrusion pressures of some typical SFRCC formulations according to Benbow and Bridgewater's Model. The factors studied include fiber type and fiber concentration, liquid phases with different types and concentrations, and binder systems either composed of pure cement or cement modified by slag, fly ash or silica fume. Finally extrusion experiments and mechanical tests of extrudates were carried out to check the influence of Methocel and PAM to the extrudate qualities in surface appearances and mechanical properties. It has been found that PAM would be more effective than Methocel in adjusting SFRCC's rheology. Comparing to Methocel, use of PAM reduces the extrusion pressure, improves the extrudate surface quality and enhances the mechanical properties of hardened extrudate. Incorporation of slag improves the flowability of SFRCC in that extrusion pressures and parameters become smaller; while when fly ash is used, inverse effects will be observed. Empirical effects of fibers to the fresh extrudate have been thought adequate for real application. Influences of dosage and rheological behavior of liquid phases are studied in detail and the results are presented within the context...|$|E
40|$|Associating {{polymers}} {{have attracted}} {{much interest in}} a variety of applications such as selfhealing materials, biomaterials, <b>rheological</b> <b>modifiers,</b> and actuators. The interplay of polymer topology and sticker chemistry presents significant challenges in understanding the physics of associating polymers across a wide range of time and length scales. This thesis aims to provide new insights into the structure-dynamics-mechanics relationships of associating polymer networks. This thesis first examines diffusion of various types of associating polymers in the gel state through a combination of experiment and theory. By using forced Rayleigh scattering (FRS), phenomenological super-diffusion is revealed as a general feature in associating networks. Experimental findings are quantitatively explained by a simple two-state model that accounts for the interplay of chain diffusion and the dynamic association-dissociation equilibrium of polymer chains with surrounding network. Furthermore, hindered self-diffusion is shown to directly correlate with a deviation from the Maxwellian behavior in materials rheological response on the long time scale. To further understand how sticker dynamics affects the network mechanical properties, a new method referred to as "sticker diffusion and dissociation spectrometry" is developed to quantify the dissociation rate of stickers in the network junctions. It is demonstrated that sticker dissociation is a prerequisite step for sticker exchange that leads to macroscopic stress relaxation. Finally, this thesis explores the use of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to measure self-diffusion of associating polymers, and a mathematical framework is established. The second part of this thesis focuses on the development of new methods of controlling the mechanical properties of associating networks through engineering the molecular structure of polymer chains. Specifically, topological entanglement is introduced into the network through extending the polymer chains to reach beyond their entanglement threshold. This strategy drastically enhances material's toughness, extensibility, creep resistance and stability in solutions. Various types of coupling chemistries are then explored to fine tune the extent of entanglement. The entanglement effect and the long-time relaxation of materials can be further controlled by introducing branching points into the macromolecules. by Shengchang Tang. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Nano{{cellulose}} is a cellulose entity at the nanoscale. There {{are several}} {{different types of}} nanocellulose such as cellulose nanofibrils (CNF), which are long, somewhat flexible fibrils and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC), which are shorter and more rod-like particles. These entities are considered to have good mechanical properties; this combined with a low density makes nanocellulose an interesting candidate for several applications, e. g. transparent high strength paper, barrier films, reinforcing elements in composites and <b>rheological</b> <b>modifiers.</b> In the manufacturing of such products the rheological properties of the material are of great importance. A substantial part of this thesis {{has been devoted to}} assessment of the rheological behaviour of aqueous suspensions of CNF/CNC as well as of polymer melts containing the same nanomaterials. In general, both systems exhibited, quite a complex behaviour; the suspensions were shear-thinning and also exhibited a viscoelastic character (in agreement with other studies). An increase in the concentration of CNF/CNC generates a corresponding increase in shear viscosity and of the magnitude of the storage and loss moduli, characterizing the viscoelastic behaviour. For the first time, it was also shown that aqueous CNF suspension exhibited an extensional thinning viscosity during contraction flow, which can be of consequence in processing operations. It may be remarked that this complex rheological behaviour was noted already at low concentrations of CNF/CNC and could be attributed to a low percolation threshold for network formation. It is not only the concentration of the nanoelements that is of importance in this context. Here, different types of CNF/CNF were characterized with regard to their dimensions using atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy and relations between the rheological properties and the dimensions were noted and discussed.. In a similar way, presence of charged surface groups and grafted polymer segments on CNF/CNC were found to have a strong effect on the rheology of these suspensions. Another area focussed on in this thesis was the use of CNF as reinforcing elements in polymer matrices. Two polymer matrices were used; poly(ethylene glycol) and an ethylene-acrylic acid copolymer. With the latter matrix, the amount of CNF used was high, up to 70 volume-%. In both systems, the addition of CNF substantially improved the modulus of the materials (and in some cases also the strength). Even at temperatures higher than the melting point of the matrices, the material could carry load indicating the forming of a coherent CNF-network. An analysis of the tensile modulus using the Cox-Krenchel model, pointed to that the fibrils formed aggregates in the composite resulting in stiffness values less than possibly could be expected...|$|E
40|$|The {{papermaking}} industry uses a {{large amount}} of starch each year, both as a wet-end additive and as a <b>rheological</b> <b>modifier</b> in surface sizing and coating colors. It is important to be able {{to reduce the amount of}} chemicals used in the papermaking and surface treatment process, to reduce costs and to make the process even more efficient. Interest in new high-performance starches is great. By using these new types of starches, improved recycling of barrier products may be obtained as well as a reduction in the use of synthetic sizing agents. The objectives of this work were to understand the behavior of temperature-responsive hydrophobically modified starches, where the solubility in water simply can be adjusted by temperature or by polymer charge, to improve the barrier properties, like the water vapor permeability, mechanical properties and water resistance (Cobb and contact angle) of papers surface sized by starch-containing solutions, and to investigate the potential for industrial use of these temperature-responsive starches. It was demonstrated that the temperature-responsive starches phase separate upon cooling and, depending on the charge density of the starch, a particulate precipitation or a gel-like structure was obtained. The starch with zero net charge showed a larger increase in turbidity than the starch with a cationic net charge, indicating that particulate precipitation is favored by a zero net charge and that the formation of a gel network is favored by charged starch molecules. Further, the starches formed inclusion complexes with surfactants, giving stabilization to the starches in the presence of surfactants. The net charge density of the starch and the charge of the surfactant determined whether or not an inclusion complex would form between them. Important mechanisms for the stability of the starch seemed to be formation of mixed micellar-like structures between the hydrophobic chain of the starch and the surfactant along the starch backbone in addition to formation of inclusion complexes between the starch and the surfactant. The hydrophobically modified starches showed higher hydrophobic surface character when applied to the paper surface above the critical phase separation temperature than with application at room temperature. Free films of the temperature-responsive starches showed good barrier against oxygen, but no barrier against water vapor. The mechanical properties decreased with addition of glycerol to the films...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the ways}} that matter deforms and flows, which {{is the focus of}} the branch of science known as rheology, is {{essential}} for the efficient processing and proper function of such practically and technologically important materials as plastics, paints, oil-drilling fluids, and consumer products. Rheology is also powerful from a scientific perspective because of the correlation between rheological properties and the structure and behavior of matter on microscopic and molecular scales. The developing sub-field of microrheology, which explicitly examines flow and deformation behavior on microscopic length scales, provides additional clarity to this connection between rheology and microstructure. Aging materials, whose rheological properties evolve over time, are one class of materials that are of significant scientific and practical interest for their rheological behavior. Also, the unique field-responsive rheological properties of magnetorheological (MR) suspensions, which can be tuned with an applied magnetic field, have been used to create active vibration damping systems in such diverse applications as seismic vibration control and prosthetics. A material that undergoes rheological aging and that has received much attention from soft matter researchers is the synthetic clay Laponite®. This material is attractive as a <b>rheological</b> <b>modifier</b> in industrial applications and consumer products because a rich array of rheological properties, including a yield stress, viscoelasticity, and a shear-thinning viscosity, can be achieved at very low concentrations in aqueous dispersions (~ 1 w%). Though this behavior has been investigated extensively using traditional 'bulk' rheology, a number of important questions remain regarding the nature of the dispersion microstructure. The techniques of microrheology, in which rheological properties are extracted from the motion of embedded microscopic probe particles, could help to elucidate the connection between microstructure and rheology in this material. Microrheological studies can be performed using passive techniques, in which probes are subject only to thermal motion, and active techniques, in which external forces are applied to probes. Because aqueous Laponite® dispersions exhibit a significant yield stress, they could be beneficial as novel matrix fluids for magnetorheological suspensions. MR fluids consist of a suspension of microscopic magnetizable particles in a non-magnetic matrix fluid. When an external magnetic field is applied, the particles attract each other and align in domain-spanning chains of particles, resulting in significant and reversible changes in rheological properties. Because of the typically large density difference between the matrix fluid and the suspended magnetic particles, however, sedimentation is often problematic in MR fluids. A yield stress matrix fluid such as an aqueous Laponite® dispersion could help address this issue. In this thesis, bulk rheology and microrheology experiments are combined in order to provide a thorough characterization of the rheological properties of aqueous Laponite® dispersions. Multiple Particle Tracking (MPT), a passive microrheology technique, is used to explore the gelation properties of dilute dispersions, while an active magnetic tweezer microrheology technique is used to examine the yield stress and shear-thinning behavior in more concentrated dispersions. MPT results show strong probe-size dependence of the gelation time and the viscoelastic moduli, implying that the microstructure is heterogeneous across different length scales. We also demonstrate the first use of magnetic tweezers to measure yield stresses at the microscopic scale, and show that yield stress values determined from bulk and micro-scale measurements are in quantitative agreement in more concentrated Laponite® dispersions. With a thorough understanding of the clay rheology, we study the magnetorheology of MR suspensions in a yield stress matrix fluid composed of an aqueous Laponite® dispersion. Sedimentation of magnetic particles is prevented essentially indefinitely, and for sufficient magnetic field strengths and particle concentrations the matrix fluid yield stress has negligible effect on the magnetorheology. Using particle-level simulations, we characterize the ability of the matrix fluid yield stress to arrest the growth of magnetized particle chains. The methods and results presented in this thesis will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the rheology and microstructure of aqueous Laponite® dispersions and provide researchers with new techniques for investigating complex fluids on microscopic length scales. Additionally, our characterization of the effects of a matrix fluid yield stress on magnetorheological properties will aid formulators of MR fluids in achieving gravitationally stable field-responsive suspensions, and provide a new method for manipulating the assembly of particle building blocks into functional structures. by Jason P.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Dense {{colloidal}} dispersions are rheologically {{complex and}} exhibit properties like yield stress, creep, and elasticity due to aggregation and other interparticle interactions. The overall rheological {{performance of the}} system is due to the multiscale properties and mechanics: the nanoscale interactions between particles determine the microscopic texture, i. e. aggregate compactness, structure and strength. At microscale the micromechanics and microstructure evolution in aggregates under stress define the macroscale rheological performance. The interparticle forces and microstructure also evolve over time (aging interparticle bonds and aggregate structures), leading to time/frequency dependent rheological behavior. The systems of specific interest here are dense nuclear waste slurries stored at the US Department of Energy sites at Hanford, WA and Savannah, GA since 1943. <b>Rheological</b> <b>modifiers</b> are currently being investigated for effective transport of these dense waste slurries in the vitrification process developed for more permanent radioactive waste disposal. The overall objective of the study is to fundamentally understand the performance of rheology modifiers in environments similar to those of nuclear waste slurries. We are particularly focused on the effect of rheology modifiers on interparticle interactions and its implication towards bulk rheological performance. These interactions were investigated through various macroscale (rheology and electroacoustics) and microscale (atomic force microscope) colloidal interaction measurement techniques. The implications of these interactions towards rheological performance are studied using the simple yield stress model defined by Russel et al. Here the model has been extended to steric, and bridging forces between particles. It was identified that polyelectrolytes, specifically poly (acrylic acid), is an effective rheology modifier for high pH and high salt content environments of nuclear waste slurries. The correct choice of molecular weight of the PAA was especially important to its effectiveness: too low a value provides insufficient steric stabilization, while too high a value induces bridging. The effect of poly (acrylic acid) adsorption on the electrokinetic behavior of alumina dispersions under high pH conditions was also investigated as a function of polymer concentration and molecular weight as well as the presence, concentration and ion type of background electrolyte. The interparticle interaction forces were directly measured in nuclear waste simulant using atomic force microscopy. A link between the dynamics of polymer bridging and disruption and bulk rheology was established for a model dense colloidal suspension of silica particles flocculated by polyethylene oxide (PEO). In the finial study, as a side project, we have expanded acoustic spectroscopy and electroacoustic techniques to characterize particles dispersed in viscoelastic polymer gel media (another complex system of interest) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{detailed in}} this thesis is {{an investigation of the}} chemistry, applications, and methods for the synthesis of graphene oxide (GO), GO derivatives, graphite derivatives, carbon black derivatives, and activated charcoal derivatives, with an emphasis on applications relevant to the oil and gas industry. More particularly, the research involves a method for the rapid purification of GO; the use of GO and GO derivatives in oil-drilling fluids; the use of activated charcoal and carbon black for asphaltene inhibition; and the synthesis of nanoplatelets from an H 2 SO 4 /SO 3 /SO 5 - graphite intercalation compound and their application as conductivity enhancers in oil-based drilling fluids. Although many applications for GO {{have been reported in the}} literature, development of these applications on an industrial scale is held back by the lack of scalable procedures for the purification of GO after synthesis. A scheme for scalable purification is presented in Chapter 1. Suspensions of the resulting GO were tested for rheology and radionuclide uptake. One of the many possible industrial applications of GO and GO-derived products are their use in oil-drilling formulations also known as “drilling muds”. In Chapter 2, the performance of GO and chemically converted graphene as fluid loss control (FLC) agents and <b>rheological</b> <b>modifiers</b> in water-based mud (WBM) is investigated. Large-flake GO was found to be the best FLC additive in fresh-water mud (FWM), and five times more efficient as a rheological modifier than materials used in current FWM formulations. When WBM cannot be used for drilling, and oil-based mud (OBM) needs to be used instead, the reduced performance of resistivity-based imaging tools is of concern. In order to improve their performance, the electrical permittivity of the oil-based medium needs to be improved without disrupting the chemical equilibrium of the drilling formulation. For this purpose, a new method for the synthesis of graphite-derived nanoplatelets was studied (Chapter 3), and their performance as conductivity enhancers in OBM was investigated (Chapter 4). As an additional application of carbonaceous nanoparticles to the oilfield, the use of carbon black and activated charcoal particles for the inhibition, prevention or remediation of asphaltene deposition was investigated (Chapter 5). It was found that these nanoparticles can help stabilize, or controllably precipitate, asphaltenes by virtue of their high surface area, and by being a thermodynamically preferable surface for asphaltene deposition. Early collaborative works with a significant contribution by the author are included in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7. The work included in Chapter 6 pertains to the background of Chapter 2, and the work included in Chapter 7 pertains to the background of Chapter 3...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the EM- 31 <b>Rheological</b> <b>Modifiers</b> and Wetting Agents program is to utilize commercially available rheology modifiers to increase the solids fraction of radioactive sludge based waste streams, resulting {{in an increase in}} throughput and decreasing the overall processing time. The program first investigates the impact of rheology modifiers on slurry simulants and then utilizes the most effective rheology modifiers on radioactive slurries. The work presented in this document covers the initial investigation of rheology modifier testing with simulants. This task is supported by both the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). The SRNL EM- 31 task, for this year, was to investigate the use of rheology modifiers on simulant Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) melter feeds. The task is to determine, based on the impact of the rheology modifier, if there are rheology modifiers that could reduce the water content of the slurry going to the DWPF melter, hence increasing the melt rate by decreasing the water loading. The rheology modifier in essence would allow a higher solids content slurry to have the same type of rheology or pumpability of a lower solids slurry. The modifiers selected in this report were determined based on previous modifiers used in high level waste melter feed simulants, on-going testing performed by counterparts at PNNL, and experiences gain through use of modifiers in other Department of Energy (DOE) processes such as grout processing. There were 12 rheology modifiers selected for testing, covering both organic and inorganic types and they were tested at four different concentrations for a given melter feed. Five different DWPF melter feeds were available and there was adequate material in one of the melter feeds to increase the solids concentration, resulting in a total of six simulants for testing. The mass of melter feed available in each simulant was not adequate for testing each rheology modifier, hence based on the changes in rheology for a given rheology modifier, rheology modifiers were either dropped or added between simulants. Three rheology modifiers were used on all simulants. The results from this testing indicate that citric acid or polycarboxylate based rheology modifiers are the most effective in reducing the yield stress, by as much as 70 % at the higher rheology modifier additions and were effective on most of the tested simulants. These rheology modifiers are organic, hence the can also be used as reductants in melter operations. The most effective non-organic rheology modifiers, sodium metasilicate reduced the yield stress by 10 %. It is recommended that both citric acid and commercially available polycarboxylate rheology modifiers be further investigated. Different molecular weight polycarboxylates and different types of polycarboxylates used in other industries must be considered. These polycarboxylates are extensively utilized in the cement, ceramic, and water treatment processes, hence readily available. Future work on DWPF melter feeds involving rheology modifiers should include, assuming the present method of processing sludge through DPWF does not change, is: (1) Investigate the use of polycarboxylate in various processes and procure polycarboxylates for testing. Limit rheology modifier selection and future testing between four and eight different types. (2) Test rheology modifiers on at least two different chemical types or bounding DWPF SME product simulants. Test to include the impact of boiling and the effectiveness in reducing water content via rheology versus weight percent curves. (3) Based on selected modifiers, perform testing on actual radioactive melter feed based on results from simulant testing...|$|E
