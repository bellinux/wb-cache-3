5|$|Originally called Capsule Monsters, the game's title {{went through}} several {{transitions}} due to trademark difficulties, becoming CapuMon and KapuMon before eventually settling upon Pocket Monsters. Tajiri {{always thought that}} Nintendo would reject his game, as the company did not <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> concept at first. However, the games {{turned out to be}} a complete success, something Tajiri and Nintendo never expected, especially because of the declining popularity of the Game Boy. Upon hearing of the Pokémon concept, Miyamoto suggested creating multiple cartridges with different Pokémon in each, noting it would assist the trading aspect.|$|E
25|$|Laura Joplin, Janis' younger sister, {{said in an}} {{interview}} that her sister went straight to her parents' home in Port Arthur, Texas, following Woodstock, was incredibly vibrant and happy after coming home, and really loved the festival. Joplin told her family how great it was, but her mother and father remained distant on the subject as they did not <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> hippie movement.|$|E
25|$|C {{recognizes the}} fact that there are {{individuals}} in high-risk circumstances who either by choice or by coercion are going to find themselves unable to follow A and B, and therefore they need to have access to condoms, and they need to understand the correct and consistent use of condoms. I think more and more of the experts, the people who <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> prevention requirements with HIV/AIDS, have come to endorse ABC in a very balanced way as the appropriate prevention centerpiece.|$|E

500|$|A {{mercenary}} {{capable of}} turning {{his body to}} metal, making him invulnerable. Bautista described the character as a [...] "good guy" [...] who [...] "made {{a lot of bad}} choices in his life. He doesn’t <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> difference between right and wrong." [...] RZA auditioned Bautista for the role after seeing him [...] "moving as fast as lightning" [...] during a stick-fighting training video.|$|E
2500|$|He did songwriting {{wherever}} he could, including on buses, and used an upright piano above the Birdland Club in New York City. One {{of the causes}} of this early nomadic life as a songwriter was due to his songs having too many words: [...] "I'd {{spent a lot of time}} on lyrics, and they were looking for hooks, and I didn't <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> nature of that," [...] he says.|$|E
2500|$|He {{wrote that}} [...] "Christian faith has {{been central to}} the {{emergence}} of the nation and its development. We cannot <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> nature and achievements of British society without reference to it. In a plural, multifaith and multicultural situation, it can still provide the resources for both supporting and critiquing public life in this country. We have argued {{that it is necessary to}} understand where we have come from, to guide us to where we are going, and to bring us back when we wander too far from the path of national destiny." ...|$|E
5000|$|Alan Williams, {{former head}} of {{procurement}} at the Department of National Defence, previously critical of the Conservative government's handling of the fighter replacement, responded to the Super Hornet announcement, saying it was [...] "absurd" [...] and [...] "unnecessary", adding [...] "I'm not sure whether <b>the</b> government <b>really</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> business of defence procurement".|$|R
5000|$|Their [...] "temporary stay" [...] {{thinking}} was even stronger {{than that of}} the Chinese, believing that one day they will return to their Homeland. They abhorred the British colonial authorities and longed for Indian independence. Neither the MCP nor <b>the</b> MPAJA <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> situation of the Indians, therefore the Indians did not support MPAJA.|$|R
50|$|Although {{raised in}} a Christian household, John claimed that he never <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> Christian message until he heard evangelist David Upadeshi (Tamil David) {{speaking}} at the Maramon Mar Thoma Church. John {{made a commitment to}} follow Jesus Christ. He subsequently received Bible teaching from the Baptist Missionary J.G. Gregson in Ayroor. John began preaching while continuing with his occupation as a farmer.|$|R
2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy spoke on several episode topics. Regarding {{the pace of}} the two-parter {{and the rest of the}} season episodes, he said, [...] "American Horror Story is always about a slow rollout of the season of reveals. The pace of these two is a little slower. The scenes are longer and I think more thoughtful than {{the pace of the}} first three. These are two of my favorite episodes in the history of the show. Also, in these episodes, I think we <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> world a little more and what we're trying to write about which is the horror of the insane asylum back in the '50s and '60s and the degradation and the abuse, the real-life horrors. I think we really hit that in a great way in the Anne Frank story." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010, Duncan Smith {{studied a}} state-sponsored {{relationship}} education programme in Norway, under which couples {{were forced to}} [...] "think again" [...] and confront the reality of divorce before formally separating. The policy has been credited with reversing Norway’s trend for rising divorce rates and halting the decline of marriage in the country over the past 15 years. Duncan Smith said he was keen to explore ways in which similar approaches could be encouraged in Britain. Officials pointed out that such a programme would be expensive but that an approach could reduce the long-term cost of family breakdown, which has been estimated at up to £100billion. Duncan Smith said couples in Norway were able to [...] "work through {{what is going to}} happen with their children", which has [...] "a very big effect on their thinking". [...] "Many of them think again about what they are going to embark on once they <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> consequences of their actions subsequently," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Green stared, for {{his mind}} was {{precisely}} one of those which would conceive {{it to be a}} high act of audacity in a ci-devant colonist to claim the rights of an old country, even did he <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> legality and completeness of the separation.|$|E
50|$|In 1953, Cummings became {{dissatisfied}} with cotton brokering. In his words, “I didn’t feel that President Eisenhower, Agriculture Secretary Benson, or even <b>the</b> American farmer <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> agricultural {{problems of the}} day. Their policy showed they favored lower farm prices and uncontrolled production, inviting disaster for cotton, and for farmers in general.” His projection was verified by declining cotton profitability.|$|R
50|$|Reformed theologian, pastor, {{and author}} R.C. Sproul {{suggests}} there is confusion {{about what the}} doctrine of limited atonement actually teaches. While he considers {{it possible for a}} person to believe four points without believing the fifth, he claims that a person who <b>really</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> other four points must believe in limited atonement because of what Martin Luther called a resistless logic.|$|R
60|$|Tallente, {{a person}} very little given to self-analysis, never <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> impulse which {{prompted}} him to lean towards her, the slightly quickening sense of excitement with which he sought for the kindness of her eyes. Suddenly he felt his fingers clasped in hers, a warm, pleasant grasp, yet which somehow or other {{seemed to have the}} effect of a barrier.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I {{would do}} so. They change their Residents so {{frequently}} {{that it would}} be impossible for new men to <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> situation; which you, with your intimate knowledge of Poona, could readily grasp. Of course the arrangement could only be temporary, as my own position is so uncertain and, in any case, my life cannot now be a long one.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Hodder," [...] {{she cried}} impulsively, [...] "was it {{necessary}} to go so far? and all at once. I am here not only because I am miserable, but I am concerned on your account. You hurt me very much that day you came to me, but you made me your friend. And I wonder if you <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> terrible, bitter feeling you have aroused, the powerful enemies you have made by speaking so--so unreservedly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{doctor is}} {{accustomed}} in his profession," [...] he began, [...] "and I am accustomed in mine, {{to have the}} secrets of others placed in our keeping. But it is my duty, before we go further, to ask if you <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> extraordinary position which we now occupy toward one another. You have just excluded Mrs. Armadale, before our own eyes, from a place in your confidence. And you are now offering that same place to two men who are total strangers to you." ...|$|E
50|$|Kodak renamed its KEEPS {{publishing}} and copier line to Lionheart. By then, the division {{lost most of}} <b>the</b> people who <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> product and the publishing industry. Lionheart was discontinued after Interleaf announced {{a new version of}} their product (Interleaf 5) which would run on PCs. In 1991, Quark released a viable product suitable for collaborative environments, and Ventura Publisher and Pagemaker became serious competitors.|$|R
5000|$|By {{signing the}} 1825 treaty, the Hunkpapa and the United States {{committed}} themselves {{to keep up the}} [...] "friendship which has heretofore existed". With their x-mark, the chiefs also recognized the supremacy of the United States. It is not certain whether they <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> text in the document. A medal was given to Little White Bear who was the principal Hunkpapa chief according to the whites.|$|R
60|$|Cuffy nestled {{very close}} to his master's side at this point, and whined in a pitiful tone, as if he <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> purport of his remarks. In five minutes more he was giving vent to {{occasional}} mild little whines and half barks, indicating {{that he was in}} the land of dreams, and Jarwin's nose was creating sounds which told that its owner had reached that blessed asylum of the weary--oblivion.|$|R
6000|$|... 479. But {{the views}} of men of science vary much as {{to the nature of}} the action by which these effects are produced; and as it is certain that we shall be better able to apply the power when we <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> manner in which it operates, this {{difference}} of opinion is a strong inducement to further inquiry. I have been led to hope that the following investigations might be considered, not as an increase of that which is doubtful, but a real addition to this branch of knowledge.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} would come," [...] Louise said at last; [...] "and I am glad, but even in these first few minutes I want to say {{something}} to you. If you wish to succeed in your object, and <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> people you meet here and the life they lead, don't be like your brother--too quick to judge. Do not hug your prejudices too tightly. You will come across many problems, many situations which will seem strange to you. Do not make up your mind about anything in a hurry." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{spite of}} Charles's gibes, I flatter myself I do <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> whole duty of a secretary. It {{was clear from}} his voice he did not wish me to {{recognise}} her; which, as it happened, I did not. [...] "Certainly, it doesn't resemble her, Charles," [...] I answered, with conviction in my voice. [...] "I should never have known her." [...] But I did not add that I should no more have known Colonel Clay himself in his character of Paul Finglemore, or of Césarine's young man, as that remark lay clearly outside my secretarial functions.|$|E
50|$|As fraternities grew, {{new issues}} appeared. Ideas over {{who should be}} a member (often tied to racial or {{cultural}} background) differed between chapters which now spread throughout the United States and Canada. The undergraduate membership continued to grow but alumni membership had grown even more. Alumnae of women's sororities who had fought hard to help establish the idea of coeducation now questioned whether {{the new generation of}} women <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> value of the sorority.|$|R
5000|$|... "It was beautiful, {{and very}} {{educational}} for us, really exciting {{in that we}} were not necessarily sent to the [...] "hotspots" [...] of the world, fact sometimes going where nothing was happening, and there's nothing to grab. Then one <b>really</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> reality of a country, of a situation. Escaping the news, or what we call the news, and is often a tragic smokescreen that hides the deeper reality, it's an opportunity.".|$|R
5000|$|The Nature {{article was}} controversial, with many experts arguing against its conclusions, {{including}} an [...] "outraged response" [...] {{later in the}} same journal by 137 authors. Richard Dawkins wrote a harshly critical review for Prospect, in which he stated that Wilson had earlier supported Bill Hamilton's theory of kin selection but had, over the years, moved away from it, {{to the point where}} it was debatable that he had <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> theory.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear lady," [...] Phineas Duge said, [...] "the {{conventions}} in your wonderful {{country are}} not {{things to be}} trifled with. Somehow or other they will assert themselves. There is your nephew here trying {{to prove to the}} world that he will {{have nothing to do with}} them, and yet it will be his painful duty to receive as much of my hard-earned savings as my daughter's dowry and Virginia's trousseau will leave to me. Never, until I was inveigled into Doucet's this afternoon, did I <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> absolute recklessness of young women who are going to marry Englishmen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have liked}} it well enough hitherto, but this last {{adventure}} has sickened me. Oh! it was dreadful. Had I {{not been very}} strong I could never have endured it; a nervous woman would have been driven mad. Yes, I have liked it well enough; I have always looked upon it as a preparation for life. I think that the society of nature is the best education for the society of man, since until you understand and are in sympathy with the one, you cannot <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> other. Now I should {{like to go to}} Europe and see the world and its civilisations, for I know from what stuff they were evolved. But perhaps I never shall; at any rate, I have to find my dear father first," [...] and she sighed.|$|E
60|$|Not {{till the}} last evening before we reached Bombay did I <b>really</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> nature of my neighbour's project. That evening, as it chanced, Elsie had a {{headache}} and went below early. I stopped with her till she dozed off; then I slipped up on deck once {{more for a}} breath of fresh air, before retiring for the night to the hot and stuffy cabin. It was an exquisite evening. The moon rode in the pale green sky of the tropics. A strange light still lingered on the western horizon. The stifling heat of the Red Sea had given way long since to the refreshing coolness of the Indian Ocean. I strolled a while on the quarter-deck, and sat down at last near the stern. Next moment, I was aware of somebody creeping up to me.|$|E
5000|$|Though, Dubois' {{opposition}} to polygamy {{seems to have}} been born out of convenience: [...] "Those of us who <b>really</b> <b>understood</b> <b>the</b> situation were not nearly so much opposed to polygamy as we were the political domination of the church. We realized however that we could not make those who did not come actually in contact with it understand what this political domination meant. We made use of polygamy in consequence as our great weapon." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Schleswig-Holstein Question ( [...] ; [...] ) was {{a complex}} set of {{diplomatic}} and other issues arising in the 19th century from the relations of two duchies, Schleswig (...) and Holstein (...) , to the Danish crown and to the German Confederation.

500|$|Pope {{would go}} on to direct the {{majority}} of the Cure's videos, which became synonymous with the band, and expanded their audience during the 1980s. Pope explained the appeal of working with the Cure by saying, [...] "the Cure is the ultimate band for a filmmaker to work with because Robert Smith <b>really</b> <b>understands</b> <b>the</b> camera. His songs are so cinematic. I mean on one level there's this stupidity and humour, right, but beneath that there are all [...] psychological obsessions and claustrophobia." ...|$|R
