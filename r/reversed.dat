5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive <b>reversed</b> manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically <b>reversed,</b> and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The <b>reversed</b> audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be <b>reversed</b> entirely.|$|E

On the other hand, suppose that the <b>reverse</b> of (12) is valid. Setting the same g(y) as theorem 3, by the <b>reverse</b> of (10), we have J > 0. If J = ∞, then the <b>reverse</b> of (13) is obvious value; if J < ∞, then by the <b>reverse</b> of (12), we obtain the <b>reverses</b> of (15) and (16).

50|$|Reverse:A similar trick play is a <b>reverse,</b> {{which often}} begins as an end-around.

5|$|The Douglas Aircraft Company {{designed}} {{a system that}} would prevent the accidental reversal of propeller blades in-flight. During development of the DC-6, the company installed a system that cut electrical power to the mechanisms which rotated the blades while the airplane was in the air. When there was enough weight on the landing gear (which would only be the case when the aircraft was on the ground), a switch which supplied electrical power to the mechanisms was closedmeaning that when the aircraft touched down the blades could be <b>reversed</b> and thus the airplane could be slowed. When the switch was closed, a red flag would swing into view in the cockpit of the aircraft, warning the crew that the blades could be <b>reversed.</b> Should the switch fail to close upon landing, the flag could be raised manually and electrical power to the mechanisms would be restored. When the aircraft took off, electrical power would be cut to the mechanisms so that the propeller blades could not be inadvertently <b>reversed,</b> and the red flag swung out of sight. Reverse thrust warning lamps, which would have warned the crew if the propellers were <b>reversed,</b> were not fitted on Mainliner Idaho.|$|E

50|$|Attempting {{to select}} <b>reverse</b> while {{the vehicle is}} moving forward causes severe gear wear (except in {{transmissions}} with synchromesh on the <b>reverse</b> gear). However, most manual transmissions have a gate that locks out <b>reverse</b> directly from 5th gear to help prevent this.

40|$|The NASA Langley Configuration Aerodynamics Branch has {{conducted}} an experimental investigation {{to study the}} static performance of innovative thrust <b>reverser</b> concepts applicable to high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines. Testing was conducted on a conventional separate-flow exhaust system configuration, a conventional cascade thrust <b>reverser</b> configuration, and six innovative thrust <b>reverser</b> configurations. The innovative thrust <b>reverser</b> configurations consisted of a cascade thrust <b>reverser</b> with porous fan-duct blocker, a blockerless thrust <b>reverser,</b> two core-mounted target thrust reversers, a multi-door crocodile thrust <b>reverser,</b> and a wing-mounted thrust <b>reverser.</b> Each of the innovative thrust <b>reverser</b> concepts offer potential weight savings and/or design simplifications over a conventional cascade thrust <b>reverser</b> design.
