5000|$|A {{variometer}} - {{also known}} as a rate of climb and descent indicator (RCDI), <b>rate-of-climb</b> <b>indicator,</b> vertical speed indicator (VSI), or vertical velocity indicator (VVI) - is one of the flight instruments in an aircraft used to inform the pilot of the rate of descent or climb. [...] It can be calibrated in feet per minute, knots (1 kn ≈ 100 ft/min) or metres per second (1 m/s ≈ 200 ft/min), depending on country and type of aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{the efforts}} of Lt. Colonel Joseph Duckworth, the Columbus Army Flying School {{developed}} and perfected two systems of training, which was adopted by the command. The first was the Flying Evaluation Board. This board instituted tough new criteria to evaluate an instructor's proficiency. The second was the [...] "full panel" [...] attitude system of instrument flying, which is credited with revolutionizing training in blind flying. In addition to the three instruments already used, students were taught to use two gyro instruments, the magnetic compass, the <b>rate-of-climb</b> <b>indicator,</b> and the clock.|$|E
50|$|He {{attended}} O'Connell School in Dublin. In 1984, {{he joined}} the Irish Air Corps at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel where {{he was in the}} 48th Apprentice Class. There he was notable for having unusual technical ability for an apprentice technician. Once he explained to a superior why a <b>rate-of-climb</b> <b>indicator</b> had a logarithmic scale (by formulating a first order differential equation to describe the operation of the device and then solving it). Also, for amusement, he built a digital clock from various basic components such as transistors, capacitors and LEDs that were lying unused in lockers in the laboratory. This clock was the model for an illustration {{on the front page of}} the Defence Forces journal on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the Apprentice School. He determined to study for a degree in Electrical Engineering.|$|E
40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{basis of calculation}} of pressure drop in tubing is reviewed briefly. The effect of pressure drop in connecting tubing upon the operation and indication of aircraft instruments is discussed. Approximate equations are developed, and charts and tables based upon them are presented for use in designing installations of altimeters, air-speed <b>indicators,</b> <b>rate-of-climb</b> <b>indicators,</b> and air-driven gyroscopic instruments...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} the <b>rate-of-climb</b> <b>indicator</b> is {{developed}} in a form adapted for application to the instrument in its present-day form. Compensations for altitude, temperature, and rate of change of temperature are discussed from the designer's standpoint {{on the basis of}} this theory. Certain dynamic effects, including instrument lag, and the use of the <b>rate-of-climb</b> <b>indicator</b> as a statoscope are also considered. Modern instruments are described. A laboratory test procedure is outlined and test results are given...|$|E
40|$|Several {{possible}} {{effects of}} heavy {{rain on the}} aerodynamic performance of an airplane and of heavy rain and associated atmospheric phenomena on the indications of flight instruments are briefly considered. It is concluded {{that the effects of}} heavy rain on the performance of an airplane are not so great as to force the airplane down from moderate altitudes. Serious malfunctioning of the air-speed indicator may occur, however, as a result of flooding of the pitot-static head and subsequent accumulation of water in the air-speed pressure line. In strong convective situations, like thunderstorms, the <b>rate-of-climb</b> <b>indicator</b> may also be seriously in error owing to rapid variations of atmospheric pressure when entering and emerging from the convection currents...|$|E
