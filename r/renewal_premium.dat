40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{calculate}} the <b>renewal</b> <b>premium</b> of finite risk reinsurance under the assumption that the interest rate shows a stochastic evolution. The problem of the convolution of the random variables involved in the calculation of the premium has been solved by simulating claim paths using the Monte-Carlo method and applying three financial decision criteria: the expected value, the variance and the standard deviation. In the last two criteria we propose to use a stochastic recurrence equation to avoid the problem of dependence between stochastic capitalization factors. The application of the variance criterion and of the standard deviation criterion has allowed us to obtain the reinsurance premium depending on the level of risk aversion of the reinsurer and the volatility of the interest rat...|$|E

40|$|Universal life {{insurance}} {{has been difficult}} to analyze due to its extremely flexible, dynamic design. ^ Methodology. The dissertation attempts to design a framework for evaluating investment and product design strategies for a universal life policy in light of the exogenous stochastic effects which influence the viability of the product. Data for the estimation were obtained from a large midwestern stock life insurer. A Box-Jenkins transfer function model approach is used to identify insurance cash flow models and ridge regression is used to control for multicollinearity. A set of significant exogenous economic input variables are identified for each cash flow component which include: new and <b>renewal</b> <b>premium</b> income, policy loans, cash value surrenders, and partial surrenders. ^ The estimated insurance cash flow models are then combined with assumptions about investment policy to form an 2 ̆ 2 integrated 2 ̆ 2 experience model. This combination allows for the use of a so-called scenario testing approach, through which the potential impact on policy experience of various exogenous economic and internal investment 2 ̆ 2 scenarios 2 ̆ 2 can be assessed. A detailed discussion of various asset/liability management approaches is provided and is followed by specific illustrations of how these approaches {{can be applied to the}} integrated experience model. ^ Results. Several interesting results are found with respect to insurance cash flows. First, the number of new policies and the premium on these increase with increases in the yield spread and decreases in the rate of unemployment. This suggests a sensitivity of universal {{life insurance}} premium flows to economic changes. Renewal and replacement premiums also increase with decreases in the rate of unemployment. Second, the direct recognition strategy used in the policy appears to lessen the disintermediation risk associated with policy loan activity. Some evidence suggests that policyholders may opt to 2 ̆ 2 disintermediate 2 ̆ 2 through the reduction of premium payments rather than through the exercise of policy loan and surrender options. ^ Conclusions. The dissertation provides some insight into premium and policy persistency under varying economic environments. Investigation of various credited rate strategies, also, suggests that this component is important in determining policy performance. Finally, the desirability of a particular investment strategy is found to vary across the different economic scenarios. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.) ...|$|E

The individual claim size random variables come from one of nine combinations of tail types (heavy, neutral and light) and frequency/severity (low/high, mid/mid and high/low) distributions. We consider strategies to reduce the ruin probabilities and enhance the expected profits or gains. First we analyze a pricing method where the <b>renewal</b> <b>premiums</b> are based on Buhlmann’s credibility theory. Then we add two policy provisions, a deductible and a policy limit.

40|$|This paper {{explains}} why a commonly-used metric of pricing performance, the Renewal Rate Change statistic, might not give true indications {{of the real}} rate change on Catastrophe (Cat) -Exposed Excess Property business. At the account level, false readings may arise when the renewal and expiring policies cover different layers or different sets of locations. When that happens, premium changes stemming from such differences are confounded with real changes in rate level. The paper presents a proposal to appropriately reflect coverage layer and location schedule differences. The proposal involves use of Cat Loss Simulation models to estimate the percentage by which the premium for an account should change in response to such differences. Once individual policy rate changes are correctly calculated, {{there is a potential}} problem in aggregating the individual results to a correct portfolio total. Concrete examples are presented to demonstrate that weighting with <b>Renewal</b> <b>Premiums</b> is incorrect and will lead to an overly optimistic answer. The paper then proposes alternative weights that lead to an unbiased result...|$|R
2500|$|The floods {{came at a}} {{time when}} the Government and the UK {{insurance}} industry are re-negotiating a deal to provide affordable insurance to flood prone homes, known as the Statement of Principles, with the current subsidy due to expire in June 2013. The favoured solution for the insurance industry is a levy on low risk homes with the government and taxpayer acting as an insurer of last resort. The Association of British Insurers stated that [...] "The Government has indicated it will not provide any temporary overdraft facility for the insurance industry's not-for-profit scheme, which makes it very difficult for it to go ahead. As a result, negotiations have hit an impasse." [...] Should the issue not be resolved this would leave an estimated 200,000 homes unable to get insurance from June 2013. An alternative being discussed in the insurance industry is the possibility that flood pools may offer a hybrid solution acceptable to both parties. Because of the flooding in 2012, insurance <b>renewal</b> <b>premiums</b> were expected to rise between 10 and 50 percent, depending on the scale of damages suffered. Even those not directly hit by the flooding were likely to see their premiums rise by 5 percent next year. Currently insurers provide flood coverage on the understanding that government invests a certain amount of funds on flood defences, however the spending on flood defences has slipped below the levels seen in 2008.|$|R

40|$|Property is a dual good. It {{provides}} both {{a variety}} of housing services and, sometimes, investment returns. Premiums are paid for a complex bundle of relative advantages, risks, and opportunities within idiosyncratic, complex, and evolving metropolis. Factors beyond the urban footprint influence the pace of innovation and urban evolution. Housing markets respond imperfectly to policy, resource endowments, and institutional arrangements. Privilege and prospects mutate in turbulent, resource-constrained, but increasingly knowledge-driven economies. Notwithstanding the hierarchy of influences, excessive premiums signal urban stress, if not disease, in the broader planning and social debate. With the general significance of premium clarified, the research question of the project becomes: ‘What drives residential property price premium evolution in a metropolis?’ A complete answer involves establishing the nature and location of premiums and disentangling the influence and interactions of their various price drivers. To provide it, the project undertakes a property and urban literature review. Based on theory’s insight that higher order contains lower order systems, it develops and investigates a general systems model of residential premiums with two modes. Conditioned by ideology and forced by population and capital inflows, whether mineral or industrially induced, premiums mutate. Their evolution is influenced by a nested hierarchy of more or less contaminated information. To investigate the model and its different modes, the project employs tests across system pointers, at the macro, urban and micro spatial resolutions. First, it assesses the turbulence and permeability of residential property markets to exogenous influences. It then looks for links between premiums and urban inputs in the coal-driven and Sunbelt migration city of Brisbane, Australia, over the boom from 1998 - 2004. Locally, it conducts a case study and survey in one micro-location, seeking clues in transaction patterns (output), property system agents (components) and the information used (feedback mechanisms). Finally, the project draws some relevant policy implications. Although the project examines Brisbane, in Australia, its ramifications are global. It concludes that capital inflows (from mining in this case), migration or debt accentuate the endogenous mutation of property from homes within a community towards speculative paper assets. High status locations unlock knowledge-economy privilege and offer under-taxed prospective returns. While fantasy can contaminate cognitive representations of attractiveness, price exuberance is often validated by government policy infrastructure. Either deliberately or by misconstruel, public urban <b>renewal</b> projects concentrate <b>premiums</b> in previously neglected but central locations. In euphoria, revitalization projects, media hubris, and frenetic housing market activity alter collective cognitive representations and spatially anchor price bubbles. Yet, within a wider social and ecological remit, rampant premiums suggest policy flaws. In terms of windfall events or unearned rent, the cumulative effects of ill-considered or ad hoc projects and price distortions can be ugly and wasteful. The unintended consequence of resource booms, credit binges or urban projects promoted with ‘knowledge-city’ or ‘creative-city’ discourses is unaffordable housing and disconnected fringe communities. In short, enlightened urban development must balance frequently contradictory urges of private gain against visionary collective welfare. It extends beyond reinforcement of central dominance by mega iconic artistic, biological, or other projects to embrace civics, broad education excellence (in contrast to islands of private privilege) and robust transport links. Within an independent legal system and sensible policy setting, an educated and trained workforce attracts investment and fosters technological innovation. Beyond the dogmas of unregulated markets or disjointed interventions, intelligent urban development impels cohesive projects and inclusive hubs in connected edge communities. Once excessive premiums are recognized as a serious social, economic, and urban problem, its cure involves, first, policy rationalization. Afterward, other practical steps are institutional reform, governance, price and tax rationalization and spatial transparency...|$|R
