25|$|The <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu</b> has {{a history}} of instability. As such, the size and {{composition}} of coins has changed frequently.|$|E
25|$|The current Coins of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu</b> are by any {{objective}} {{standards of}} functional austere design, surpassing {{in lack of}} decoration even the plainest Communist-era predecessors.|$|E
25|$|Since 1867 the {{official}} currency {{has been the}} <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu</b> ("lion") and following a denomination in 2005, it has been valued at €0.2–0.3. After joining the EU in 2007, Romania is expected to adopt the Euro sometime around 2020.|$|E
50|$|To simplify future {{adjustments}} to ATMs after {{the adoption of}} the euro, when the <b>Romanian</b> new <b>leu</b> replaced the old leu in 2005 (at 10,000 old lei to 1 new leu) the new banknotes were the same physical dimensions as euro banknotes, except the 200 lei note, which had no euro size correspondent, and the 500 lei note, which was the same dimension as the €200 note.|$|R
2500|$|There is {{evidence}} that the Army was a main agent of both political campaigning and the eventual fraud. As an answer to increasing malcontent in military ranks, the Groza cabinet increased their revenues and supplies preferentially (arguably, their salaries remained weak when confronted to the <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu's</b> high rate of inflation). In January, Army agitprop sections of the [...] "Education, Culture and Propaganda" [...] Directorate (Direcţia Superioară pentru Educaţie, Cultură şi Propagandă a Armatei, or ECP), already employed in channeling political messages inside military ranks, were authorized to carry out [...] "educational activities" [...] outside of the facilities and into the rural area. PNŢ and PNL activists were barred entry on Army grounds, while the ECP closely supervised soldiers who supported the opposition, and repeatedly complained about the [...] "political backwardness" [...] and [...] "liberties in voting" [...] of various Army institutions. While several Army officials guaranteed that their subordinates were to vote for the BPD unanimously, low-ranking members occasionally expressed criticism over the violent quelling of PNŢ and PNL activities inside Army units.|$|R
50|$|The later Dutch daalders {{also carried}} {{the picture of}} a lion, which gave them the name leeuwendaalder ("lion thaler"). From an {{abbreviation}} of leeuwendaalder come the names of three present-day Balkan currencies, the <b>Romanian</b> and Moldovan <b>Leu</b> and the Bulgarian Lev.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu</b> {{was briefly}} the world's least valued {{currency}} unit, from January (when the Turkish lira dropped six zeros) to July 2005. However, the 1,000,000-lei note {{was not the}} highest Romanian denomination ever; a 5,000,000-lei note had been issued in 1947.|$|E
25|$|Iorga {{became the}} subject of {{numerous}} visual portrayals. Some of the earliest were satires, such as an 1899 portrait of him as a Don Quixote (the work of Nicolae Petrescu Găină) and images of him as a ridiculously oversized character, in Ary Murnu's drawings for Furnica review. Later, Iorga's appearance inspired the works of some other visual artists, including his own daughter Magdalina (Magda) Iorga, painter Constantin Piliuță and sculptor Ion Irimescu, who was personally acquainted with the scholar. Irimescu's busts of Iorga are located in places of cultural importance: the ISSEE building in Bucharest and a public square in Chișinău, Moldova (ex-Soviet Bessarabia). The city has another Iorga bust, the work of Mihail Ecobici, in the Aleea Clasicilor complex. Since 1990, Iorga's face is featured on a highly circulated <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu</b> bill: the 10,000 lei banknote, which became the 1 leu bill following a 2005 monetary reform.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{disillusioned with}} the League {{because of its}} {{laborious}} and unanimous decision-making processes, Monnet resigned in 1923 and devoted himself to managing the family business, which was experiencing difficulties. In 1925, Monnet moved to America to accept a partnership in Blair & Co., a New York bank which merged with Bank of America in 1929, forming Bancamerica-Blair Corporation which was owned by Transamerica Corporation. He returned to international politics and, as an international financier, proved to be instrumental to the economic recovery of several Central and Eastern European nations. He helped stabilise the Polish złoty in 1927 and the <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu</b> in 1928. In November 1932, the Chinese Minister of Finance invited Jean Monnet to act as chairman of an East-West non-political committee in China {{for the development of}} the Chinese economy where he lived until 1936. During his time in China, Monnet's task of partnering Chinese capital with foreign companies led to the formal inauguration of the Chinese Development Finance Corporation (CDFC) as well as the reorganization of the Chinese railroads.|$|E
25|$|A {{new series}} of {{economic}} changes followed: the National Bank of Romania was passed into full public ownership (December 1946), and, in order to combat the <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu's</b> devaluation, a surprise monetary reform was imposed as a stabilization measure in August 1947 (severely limiting the amount convertible by people without an actual job, primarily members of the aristocracy). The Marshall Plan was being overtly condemned, while nationalization and a planned economy were enforced beginning 11 June 1948. The first five-year plan, conceived by Miron Constantinescu's Soviet-Romanian committee, was adopted in 1950. Of newly enforced measures, the arguably most far-reaching was collectivization—by 1962, when the process was considered complete, 96% of the total arable land had been enclosed in collective farming, while around 80,000 peasants faced trial for resisting and 17,000 others were uprooted or deported for being chiaburi (the Romanian equivalent of kulaks). In 1950, the party, which viewed itself as {{the vanguard of the}} working class, reported that people of proletarian origin held 64% of party offices and 40% of higher government posts, while results of the recruitment efforts remained below official expectations.|$|R
2500|$|The later [...] Dutch daalders {{also carried}} {{the picture of}} a lion, which gave them the name leeuwendaalder ("lion thaler"). [...] From an {{abbreviation}} of leeuwendaalder come the names of three present-day Balkan currencies, the <b>Romanian</b> and Moldovan <b>Leu</b> and the Bulgarian Lev.|$|R
40|$|Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) {{represents}} a fundamental concept in exchange rate modeling. The main idea {{is given by}} equality between prices in two different countries when expressing in the same currency. This paper aims to analyze the behavior of real exchange rate between EURO and <b>Romanian</b> new <b>leu</b> (RON) under PPP paradigm. We use the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron stationarity tests in order to check real exchange deviations from PPP. Also, we investigate {{the existence of a}} connection between long-term between nominal exchange rate and industrial producer price indices from Romania and euro area. The main conclusions of this research highlight that PPP doesn’t holds; real exchange rate stationarity tests doest not confirm the stationarity, thus between the aforementioned three variables it doesn’t exists any equilibrium relation...|$|R
500|$|The regions {{coming under}} Romania's {{administration}} {{at the end}} of the war still maintained their ad hoc administrative structures, including the Transylvanian Directory Council, set up and dominated by the PNR; Averescu ordered these dissolved in April, facing protest from local notabilities. At the same time, he ordered all troops to be demobilized. He unified currency around the <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu,</b> and imposed a land reform in the form in which it was to be carried out by the new Brătianu executive. In fact, the latter measure had been imposed by the outgoing PNL cabinet through the order of Ion G. Duca, in a manner which Argetoianu described as [...] "destructive". As an initial step, Averescu's government appointed the noted activist Vasile Kogălniceanu, a deputy for Ilfov County, as rapporteur; Kogălniceanu used this position to give an account of the agrarian situation in Romania, stressing the role played by his ancestor, Constantin, in abolishing Moldavian serfdom, as well as that of his father, Mihail Kogălniceanu, in eliminating corvées throughout Romania.|$|E
500|$|In this context, Mitică {{is shown}} to have {{developed}} a series of jargon-like expressions. When recounting this to his friends that a clerk has been fired from office, refers to this [...] "a promotion", elaborating that the new office involves [...] "chasing flies out of [...] Cişmigiu". Caragiale provides some of his character's one-liner jokes, which include references to garlic as [...] "Serbian vanilla", and to <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu</b> banknotes as [...] "Trajan's pictures" [...] (alluding to their design, which, at the time, featured {{a portrait of the}} Roman Emperor). His absurd requests include asking a shopkeeper to sell him [...] "a few centimeters" [...] of yogurt, and telling friends to drink their beer [...] "before it cools itself" [...] or to [...] "climb on top of a sheet of paper" [...] in order to reach for clothes placed higher on a stand. Several of his puns refer to the switch from horse-drawn trams to trolley poles, for instance showing him blaming unexpected stops on horses not having been properly fed.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu</b> ( [...] , plural lei ISO 4217 code RON; {{numeric code}} 946) is the {{currency}} of Romania. It is subdivided into 100 bani ( [...] , singular: ban, [...] ). The word [...] "bani" [...] is also used for [...] "money" [...] in the Romanian language.|$|E
5000|$|... the Ţărani (Carani) of the Bor, Negotin and Zaječar {{regions are}} closer to Oltenia (Lesser Walachia) in their speech and music. The Ţărani have the saying [...] "Nu dau un leu pe el" [...] (He's not worth even a leu). The {{reference}} to [...] "leu" [...] (lion) as currency most likely {{goes back to the}} 17th century when the Dutch-issued daalder (leeuwendaalder) bearing the image of a lion was in circulation in the Romanian principalities and elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire whose own currency was habitually being debased by the government. In the Romanian principalities, as well as in Bulgaria, the leeuwendaalder (in <b>Romanian</b> and Bulgarian <b>leu</b> and lev, respectively) came to symbolize a strong currency. Indeed, on gaining independence in the 19th century both countries adopted this name for their new currencies. Since newly independent Serbia named its currency (the dinar) after the Roman denarius, the reference to the leu among the Ţărani is an indication of their connection to, if not origin in, what is now Romania.|$|R
2500|$|As of 2016, {{only the}} Danish krone participates in ERM II. [...] The {{currencies}} of Sweden (the Swedish krona), the three largest countries which joined the European Union on 1 May 2004 (the Polish złoty, the Czech koruna, and the Hungarian forint), {{the two countries}} which joined on 1 January 2007 (the Bulgarian lev, and the <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu)</b> as well Croatia, which joined the EU on 1 July 2013 (the Croatian kuna), are required to join {{in accordance with the}} terms of the applicable treaties of accession.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{the chronic}} {{inflation}} experienced in Turkey from the 1970s {{through to the}} 1990s, the old lira experienced severe depreciation. Turkey has had high inflation rates compared to developed countries and suffered hyperinflation. From an average of 9 lira per U.S. dollar in the late 1960s, the currency came to trade at approximately 1.65 new lira per U.S. dollar in late 2001. This represented an average inflation of about 38% per year. Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had called this problem a [...] "national shame". With the revaluation of the Turkish old lira, the <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu</b> (also revalued in July 2005) briefly became the world's least valued currency unit.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2003, the Grand National Assembly of Turkey {{passed a}} law that allowed for redenomination by the removal of six zeros from the Turkish lira, and the {{creation}} of a new currency. It was introduced on 1 January 2005, replacing the previous Turkish lira (which remained valid in circulation until the end of 2005) at a rate of 1 second Turkish lira (ISO 4217 code [...] "TRY") = 1,000,000 first Turkish lira (ISO 4217 code [...] "TRL"). With the revaluation of the Turkish lira, the <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu</b> (also revalued in July 2005) briefly became the world's least valued currency unit. At the same time, the Government introduced two new banknotes called TRY100 and TRY50.|$|E
2500|$|Officially, the purge was {{centered}} on accusations regarding Luca's {{opposition to the}} monetary reform of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu,</b> a measure ordered by the Soviet Union and carried out on 28 January 1952. He had been charged, through the voice of Miron Constantinescu, with [...] "grave deviations" [...] and taking a [...] "right wing opportunistic line, breaking away from the working classes" [...] (see Right Opposition); in addition to sharing the blame, Pauker was accused of having taken a [...] "left wing opportunistic line" [...] (see Left Opposition) on various issues. Upon witnessing the attack on him during the Plenary meeting of May (immediately amplified by the interventions of Alexandru Moghioroş, Iosif Rangheţ, Ion Vincze and others), Luca fainted. He was arrested in the same month, some days after his deposition and political indictment.|$|E
2500|$|The leeuwendaalder was {{authorized}} to contain 427.16 grains of [...]750 fine silver and passed locally for between 32 (at introduction in 1576) to 42 stuivers (the stuiver containing less silver over time). It was {{lighter than the}} large denomination coins then in circulation, namely the ducatoon (491 grains of [...]920 fine silver and passing at 3 guilders or 60 stuivers) and the rijksdaalder (448 grains of [...]885 fine silver passing at 2½ guilders or 50 stuivers). Clearly it was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendaalders rather than in more costly rijksdaalders. Thus, the leeuwendaalder became the coin of choice for foreign trade. The coin was popular in the Middle East, the colonies {{in the east and}} in the west. It even was the origin for the names of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Leu.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Térra {{closed down}} in May 1868, and reemerged {{for a second}} and last edition between January and July 1870. At that stage, it had allied itself with the monarchist wing of [...] "Red" [...] liberalism, in power with Prime Minister Alexandru G. Golescu. The {{newspaper}} gave favorable coverage to the adoption of a national currency, the <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu.</b> This step signaled Romania's unilateral emancipation from the Ottoman Empire, her nominal overlord, but was received with alarm by leftists such as Hasdeu—while Térra called it [...] "grand" [...] news, Hasdeu's pamphlet regarded the leu as the newest symbol of Carlist usurpation. Meanwhile, the Western world was becoming outraged about discrimination and antisemitism in Romania. The nationality law was strongly supported by the liberal left, and, trying to appease the foreign governments, Domnitor Carol ceased all collaboration with the [...] "Reds".|$|E
2500|$|On November 5, the Bacius {{crossed into}} Hungary semi-clandestinely, {{knowing that they}} risked being {{returned}} at the border. The Petru Groza government was only informed later of their arrival in Bern. Like Voinea, Baciu had open disagreements with his Bucharest superiors, complaining that his efforts to publicize Romanian literature in the Swiss [...] "workers' press" [...] were not being supported by the Romanian state. He wrote for the editorial section of Tribune de Genève, to dissuade Swiss fears about the stabilization of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu.</b> The communist authorities later accused him of purposefully withholding information, [...] "thus giving reactionaries reason to minimize this important reform". In late 1947, just before the proclamation of a Romanian communist republic, Voinea resigned his posting. Baciu, who was recalled and assigned to a new post in Sofia, opted to discontinue his work in diplomacy and demand political asylum in Switzerland. He was advised {{to do so by}} a friend, Victor Popescu (son of Universul editor Stelian Popescu).|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{relatively}} late addition {{of color and}} other anti-counterfeiting features to U.S. currency, critics hold {{that it is still}} a straightforward matter to counterfeit these bills. They point out that the ability to reproduce color images is well within the capabilities of modern color printers, most of which are affordable to many consumers. These critics suggest that the Federal Reserve should incorporate holographic features, as are used in most other major currencies, such as the pound sterling, Canadian dollar and euro banknotes, which are more difficult and expensive to forge. Another robust technology, the polymer banknote, has been developed for the Australian dollar and adopted for the New Zealand dollar, <b>Romanian</b> <b>leu,</b> Papua New Guinea kina, Canadian dollar, and other circulating, as well as commemorative, banknotes of a number of other countries. [...] Polymer banknotes are a deterrent to the counterfeiter, as they are much more difficult and time consuming to reproduce. They are said to be more secure, cleaner and more durable than paper notes. One major issue with implementing these or any new counterfeiting countermeasures, however, is that (other than under Executive Order 6102) the United States has never demonetized or required a mandatory exchange of existing currency. Consequently, would-be counterfeiters can easily circumvent any new security features simply by counterfeiting older designs.|$|E
