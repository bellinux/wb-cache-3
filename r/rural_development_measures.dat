40|$|This paper proposes an {{approach}} {{for assessing the}} effectiveness of those agri-environmental schemes and <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>measures</b> aimed at enhancing the natural value of farmland and, more generally, aimed at releasing {{the pressure on the}} environment due to agriculture. First, based on fine scale data, indicators derived from the High Nature Value farmland concept are tested at different scales, resolutions and situations: LAU 2 for The Netherlands and LAU 1 for France. The effect of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>measures</b> on the evolution of these indicators is then explored. Significant cause-effect relationships are found in the French cases, while only relationships of correlations are observed from the Dutch case study, obviously caused by a lack of data. Using fine scale data on <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>measures</b> related to both 2000 – 2006 and 2007 – 2013 programming periods of the Common Agricultural Policy, a spatial econometrics methodology is applied to France, at national level on the one hand, and at a selected NUTS 2 level on the other. The results indicate that agri-environmental schemes and specific <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>measures</b> affect the changes in the indicators, and that the spatial scale of the analyses matters. In particular, results indicate that trends observed at the national scale do not necessarily apply at the regional scale (e. g. impacts of conversion to organic farming, the grassland premium, payments for water and biodiversity protection) underlining the importance of multi-scale assessments. Interestingly, delayed effects of the measures implemented in the 2000 – 2006 programming period, such as machinery investment aids and less-favoured area payments, are detectable. As regards the 2007 – 2013 <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>measures,</b> the most significant positive effects on the farm nature value indicator are found, at the national level, for locally targeted agri-environmental schemes focused on biodiversity and water issues and, at the NUTS 2 level, for supporting organic farming schemes. Given that the farm nature value indicator is built from three different indices (addressing crop diversity, grassland share, and wooded and afforested farmland) the effect of <b>rural</b> <b>development</b> <b>measures</b> on each of these individual indices is also explored. This enables the main structure and the magnitude of policy impacts to be captured and helps with the understanding of why certain objectives were not met. Key findings are relevant in the context of policy monitoring and evaluation, while the methodology proposed, that incorporates spatial effects, is an important contribution to the implementation of the Common Monitoring and Evaluation Framework by Member States to account for national, regional or local characteristics...|$|E

The paper {{contributes to the}} literature by providing a quantitative analysis of farm household decisions while explicitly taking into account the potential interaction in the choice of diversification strategies. We use data from the 2006 Italian Farm Accountancy Data Network. Diversification is explained based on internal and external characteristics. External determinants include the distance to urban population centers, landscape features and social capital in the local community. Internal determinants include farm size, specialization, tenancy restrictions, labor use and business structure. We apply a multivariate probit model to determine the factors that affect diversification decisions so as to assess the correlation between farmers’ strategies. The results highlight the importance of social capital and networks in developing diversification in Italian rural areas.

In particular, the focus was on the question whether the menu approach of the second pillar enables EU member states and regions to design Rural Development Plans with a tailor-made set of measures which address their specific rural development needs.

The FIS is considered to be “the most important measure for the promotion of investments into welfare friendly housing systems” by the Federal Ministry for Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. We evaluated the effect of the FIS on animal welfare in dairy and pig farms, applying and adapting an environment based method. Information on animal housing conditions before and after the investments was gathered in a telephone survey carried out in 2007. The farms were selected in a random disproportional sample, stratified according to the federal states. The sample sizes amount to 18 % of the population of assisted dairy farms and 32 % of assisted fattening pig farms. The analysis shows that the FIS does not achieve important improvements in the behavioural aspect of animal welfare at the examined farm types. Although there are some meliorations in the dairy farms, these are mainly due to the abandonment of tethered-stalls. At the pig farms, restriction of animal behaviour is a much more severe problem, and the FIS can not account for any progress. Should the FIS strive for achievements in the field of animal welfare, expert based definitions of investments which really lead to improvements in animal welfare are a precondition. Additionally, the measure needs to be integrated into an approach involving tightened legislation, guidelines for welfare friendly housing systems, consumer information campaigns and possibly even compensation payments.

Regarding these, the Southern and the North-Eastern regions are those in which benefits tend to be concentrated. In all the regions, policy seems to be able to absorb unemployment. Finally, policy gives the impression of reducing regional and sectoral income disparities, leading to a more balanced development.

Whereas a CAP reform is expected for the period post- 2013, an agreement on the 2014 - 2020 EU financial framework shall be reached before then. This paper attempts to capture the implications for the EU and third countries of resource reallocations in the CAP budget provision for the period 2014 - 2020. It employs a sophisticated dynamic variant of the GTAP model, known as the Modular Applied General Equilibrium Tool (MAGNET) model.
