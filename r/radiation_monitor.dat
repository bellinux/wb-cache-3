25|$|Acoustics is by {{no means}} the only subject which finds use for {{weighting}} curves however, and they are widely used in deriving measures of effect for sun exposure, gamma radiation exposure, and many other things. In the measurement of gamma rays or other ionising radiation, a <b>radiation</b> <b>monitor</b> or dosimeter will commonly use a filter to attenuate those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body, while letting through those that do the most damage, so that any source of radiation may be measured in terms of its true danger rather than just its 'strength'. The sievert is a unit of weighted radiation dose for ionising radiation, which supersedes the older unit the REM (roentgen equivalent man).|$|E

40|$|<b>Radiation</b> <b>monitoring</b> plays a {{vital role}} in the safe and {{efficient}} operation of the nuclear power plant (NPP). The current <b>radiation</b> <b>monitoring</b> system (RMS) generally uses cable monitoring network with distributed <b>radiation</b> <b>monitors.</b> It will introduce various compatibility issues that more detector nodes are added to the existing cable monitoring network. The communication protocols from different device manufacturers are not compatible. Furthermore, the original RMS has to be shut down for rewiring and reconstruction. In this paper, a heterogeneous framework is proposed based on the wireless sensor network (WSN) technology ， for monitoring environmental conditions around and inside NPP, specifically, radiation levels. The proposed full-scope RMS has a no-wiring and no-construction upgraded scheme based on the WSNs, which forms a heterogeneous multi-networks fusion control system, and does not affect the existing NPP <b>radiation</b> <b>monitoring</b> facilities. The introduction of the wireless gateway to build heterogeneous monitoring framework makes it possible to complete the system seamless upgrade with a lower cost and higher feasibility...|$|R
