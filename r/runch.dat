50|$|As {{the story}} progressed, Max's 'controller' Jerry Knight {{and local police}} became suspicious, so Max hypnotized a {{resident}} named Bert <b>Runch</b> and directed him to dispose of their corpses. After Jerry discovered the 13th Floor, Max hypnotised Jerry (for reasons including gaining Jerry’s tolerance of the 13th Floor’s continued existence), effectively reversing the role of controller and controlled. A local policeman, Sgt Ingram, discovered Max's actions and shut Max down. At this point <b>Runch</b> was on the 13th Floor and disappeared along with the floor. Jerry then switched Max back on and assisted in imprisoning Ingram on the 13th Floor before Ingram could tell anyone of the 13th Floor’s secrets.|$|E

(DSI). where you play as the Red M&M {{and try to}} stop Mr. <b>Runch,</b> a rotten and dangerous peanut, fiercely determined on {{being one of the}} M&Ms. He escaped the reject bin where he was discarded and he's on the loose in the Galaxy, where he is trying to kidnap and trap all of the M&M's into crystals until he can get what he wants: the chance to become a real M&M's candy.|$|E
5000|$|Ten {{families}} saved {{money from}} lumbering and making charcoal and bought land northwest of Houston along Cypress Creek, called [...] "The Bottoms." [...] The Bottoms {{is now in}} Lakewood Subdivision, off Louetta Road and highway 249. The families purchasing land included the families of Jake Woods, Willis Woods, Mango Weeds, Phil Blackstock, Thomas Amos, Richard Patterson, Sam Williams, Livington Stewart, Kyle Williams, and <b>Runch</b> Carrs. Willis Woods had 310 acres of land in The Bottoms. He gave land to the community for a church, cemetery, school, and the Farmers Improvements Hall. The Farmers Improvement Society was a Masonic organization. The Bottoms was right on Cypress Creek, which was frequently over its banks, so the black community moved. Mr. Pillot sold much of the land to the people, and they settled on land from present highway 249 to Boudreaux Road. All that remains of the early settlement at The Bottoms is a cemetery. Many of the graves are unmarked today, {{but some of the}} marked tombs are those for the following: Jake Woods (May 30, 1851 - August 13, 1925) Rozelia Woods (June 30, 1857 - September 11, 1922) Jacob Woods (December 3, 1875 - April 14, 1937) Ed Williams (March 29, 1879 - February 25, 1915) Strong Blackstock (July 14, 1886 - November 30, 1920) Zelma Woods (February 22, 1901 - May 9, 1925).|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Electrochemical {{machining}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} effective methods in machining of hard and complex shapes. As a result, it is a very good candidate for inside rifle machining. In this paper the principles and mathematical modelling, the results of computer simulation and experimental investigations of electrochemical rifling tool are presented. From this point of view, a rifling tool in electrochemical machining is modelled by finite element method. Then the tool based on this model is manufactured and tested. The basic non-linear differential equations are solved by <b>Runch</b> Kutta method. Some experimental tests are carried out and theoretical and experimental results are compared. The comparison between simulation modelling and experimental results shows a good agreement...|$|E
