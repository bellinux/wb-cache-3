40|$|The {{development}} of performance-based approaches {{for the design}} of structures to withstand earthquakes requires the capability to assess performance under different levels of seismic excitation. Although a great deal of work has been completed towards this goal, most of the efforts have focused on the maximum transient response or the cumulative energy dissipation characteristics as the main response indices. Considering the inevitable reality of <b>residual</b> <b>deformations</b> for systems responding in the material nonlinear range and the importance of these permanent deformations to performance characterisation, an alternative approach to quantifying performance is explored in this contribution. In this first of two companion papers, after discussion of the limitations of current performance assessment techniques to fully describe the post-earthquake state of a structure, the framework of a performance evaluation based on <b>residual</b> <b>deformations</b> including both structural and non-structural elements is first presented. A first insight into the parameters that influence <b>residual</b> <b>deformations</b> is presented through time-history analyses of hysteretic single degree-of-freedom systems.

40|$|Recently, the {{importance}} of considering <b>residual</b> (permanent) <b>deformations</b> in the performance assessment of structures has been recognized. Advanced structural systems with re-centering properties as those based on unbonded post-tensioning tendons are capable of controlling or completely eliminating <b>residual</b> <b>deformations.</b> However, for more traditional systems, which count {{for the vast majority}} of buildings, <b>residual</b> <b>deformations</b> are currently considered an unavoidable result of structural inelastic response under severe seismic shaking. In this article, a probabilistic framework for a performance-based seismic assessment of structures considering <b>residual</b> <b>deformations</b> is proposed. The development of a probabilistic formulation of a combined three-dimensional performance matrix, where maximum and <b>residual</b> <b>deformations</b> are combined to define the performance level corresponding to various damage states for a given seismic intensity levels, is first presented. Combined fragility curves expressing the probability of exceedence of performance levels defined by pairs of maximum-residual deformations are then derived using bivariate probability distributions. The significance of evaluating and accounting for <b>residual</b> <b>deformations</b> within a Performance-based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) approach is further confirmed via numerical examples on the response of Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) systems, with different hysteretic behavior, under a selected suite of earthquake records. Joined fragility curves corresponding to various performance levels, defined as a combination of maximum and residual response parameters, are derived while investigating the effects of hysteretic systems and strength ratios. It is observed that stiffness degrading Takeda systems result in lower <b>residual</b> <b>deformations</b> than elasto-plastic systems and show lower probability of exceeding a jointed maximum-residual performance level.

40|$|Developments in performance-based seismic {{design and}} {{assessment}} approaches {{have emphasized the}} importance of considering <b>residual</b> <b>deformations.</b> Recent investigations have also led to a proposed direct displacement-based design (DDBD) approach which includes an explicit consideration of the expected <b>residual</b> <b>deformations</b> {{as an integral part of}} the design process. Having estimated the expected <b>residual</b> <b>deformations</b> in a structure, engineers are faced with the problem of reducing them to meet the targeted performance levels under pre-defined seismic hazard levels. Previous studies have identified the post-yield stiffness as a primary factor influencing the magnitude of <b>residual</b> <b>deformations</b> in single degree of freedom and multiple degree of freedom structures. In this paper, a series of simple approaches to increase the post-yield stiffness of traditional framed and braced systems for the purpose of reducing <b>residual</b> <b>deformations</b> are investigated. These methods do not utilize recentring post-tensioned technology. This contribution addresses the feasibility of altering the lateral post-yield stiffness of structural systems by: (i) using different reinforcement materials with beneficial features in their stress-strain behaviour; (ii) re-designing the section geometry and properties of primary seismic-resisting elements; and (iii) introducing a secondary elastic frame to act in parallel with the primary system. The efficiency of each of these techniques is investigated through monotonic and cyclic moment-curvature and non-linear time-history analyses. Of these approaches the design and introduction of an elastic secondary system was found to be most effective and consistent in reducing <b>residual</b> <b>deformations.</b> A simplilfied design approach for achieving the desired increase of a system's post-yield stiffness is also presented.

Image processing and analysis was then used to quantify residual stretches and curvatures. For each specimen histological analysis established that the intima, media and adventitia were clearly separated, and the separation was atraumatic. Axial in situ stretches were determined to be 1. 196 ± 0. 084. On separation, the strips from the adventitia and media shortened (between 4. 03 and 8. 76 % on average), while the intimal strips elongated on average by 3. 84 % (circumferential) and 4. 28 % (axial) relative to the associated intact strips.
