5|$|Both {{the males}} and females become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year-and-a-half old. However, males {{actually}} mate after the age of four to five years. Males and females are most reproductive till the age of 14 and 14–18 years, respectively, with the maximum age of successful lactation in females being 13–14 years. With no fixed breeding season; births may occur at any time of the year. A study at Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic) showed that 55% of the births occurred between September and December. A rutting male tests the urine of any female he encounters, to which the female responds by urinating. Having located a female in estrus, the male follows her closely, trying to <b>rub</b> <b>his</b> cheek on her rump, head, neck, and chest. He performs gasping movements with his lips. Finally, the male mounts the female, resting his head and neck on her back, in a similar way as other tragelaphines.|$|E

At {{that point of}} their season, the Jaguars were 2-2-0, and feeling very hopeful for the season {{following}} a defeat at home of their division rival Indianapolis Colts. The game was very close going into the second half, and the Steelers were still stinging from a Mathis interception and runback for a touchdown. Shortly {{after the start of}} the third quarter, Jaguars mascot Jaxson de Ville stood alongside some cheerleaders, and produced a Terrible Towel, which he used to <b>rub</b> <b>his</b> armpits and buttocks. Shortly after that, the Steelers ran away with the game and the Jaguars lost 26-21. The Jaguars went on to lose eight of their remaining eleven games in the season.|$|E

She also sings the lines [...] "Let me feed you, let me run your bath water, {{whatever}} you desire" [...] after the thins she had previously listed. Rowland was noted for nearly rapping her solo part during which she promises to [...] "keep my figure right," [...] "keep my hair fixed" [...] and acknowledges that if her man comes later home while she's asleep, [...] "all he's gotta do is tap her {{on the shoulder and}} 'I'll roll over.'" [...] Williams sings her solo verses during the song's bridge.|$|E

Goren himself once described his policing ability by stating, [...] "I am an acquired taste". Even his partner, Alexandra Eames, was at first so puzzled by his methods that she asked for a new partner. She eventually came to respect his abilities, however, and the two became very close.|$|E
2500|$|The Pigeon Detectives's {{performance}} was also memorable as frontman Matt Bowman informed {{the crowd that}} he was too clean and then asked if anyone in the audience had any mud or muddy trainers that they could throw at him. This request was readily carried out by the crowd. Bowman himself then proceeded to pick up an armful of mud from the stage and rubbed it over his head. Later he ran down to the crowd, inviting fans to <b>rub</b> <b>his</b> hair, whilst {{at the end of their}} popular single [...] "I'm Not Sorry", he jumped off the stage into the crowd. This performance left Stage 2/NME noticeably caked in mud for the rest of the festival.|$|E

2500|$|The Coen {{brothers}} {{acknowledged the}} influence of Sam Peckinpah's work. In an interview with The Guardian, Ethan said, [...] "Hard men in the south-west shooting each other– that's definitely Sam Peckinpah's thing. We were aware of those similarities, certainly." [...] They discuss choreographing and directing the film's violent scenes in the Sydney Morning Herald: [...] "'That stuff is such fun to do', the brothers chime in {{at the mention of}} their penchant for blood-letting. 'Even Javier would come in {{by the end of the}} movie, <b>rub</b> <b>his</b> hands together and say, 'OK, who am I killing today?' adds Joel. 'It's fun to figure out', says Ethan. 'It's fun working out how to choreograph it, how to shoot it, how to engage audiences watching it.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Urine {{spraying}} is {{a variable}} behaviour. It may consist of simply dribbling {{a few drops}} of urine, or, large rhythmic discharges from an erect penis. [...] A stream may be aimed at the mane on the neck, or, a fine mist might be [...] sprayed against the stomach. The bull usually rub/palpates during this process. The urine can be voided almost at right angles to the erect penis. When a large volume of urine is sprayed, it usually takes place at a wallow. [...] When urine spraying, the bull lowers his head towards the ground. [...] In this position, his mane becomes soaked as he sprays urine forwards, between his legs. Once the wallow has been created, the male elk lowers himself into the area, rolls on his side and <b>rub</b> <b>his</b> mane on the soaked area of the wallow. He rubs the side of his face, his chest, stomach, legs, and flanks, which all become caked with mud. During wallowing, the elk's penis may remain erect and he may continue to spray urine.|$|E
2500|$|Juror 9, seeing Juror 4 <b>rub</b> <b>his</b> nose (which {{is being}} irritated by his glasses), {{realizes that the}} woman who {{allegedly}} saw the murder had impressions in {{the sides of her}} nose, indicating that she wore glasses, but did not wear them in court out of vanity. Other jurors, including Juror 4, confirm that they saw the same thing. Juror 8 adds that she would not have been wearing them while trying to sleep and points out that on her own evidence, the attack happened so swiftly that she wouldn't have had time to put them on. Jurors 12, 10, and 4 change their vote to [...] "not guilty", leaving only Juror 3. Juror 3 gives a long and increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks that his relationship with his own son is deeply strained, which is ultimately why he wants the boy to be guilty. He finally loses his temper and tears up a photo of him and his son, but then breaks down crying and changes his vote to [...] "not guilty", making the vote unanimous. The jurors then leave the room to reveal their verdict to the court.|$|E
