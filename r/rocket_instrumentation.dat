The intent of this demonstration was to prove the feasibility of applying fiber optic technology to <b>rocket</b> engine <b>instrumentation</b> systems. Extreme thermal transient tests were achieved by wrapping a high temperature optical fiber, which was cablized for mechanical robustness, around the combustion chamber outside wall of a 1500 lb Hydrogen-Oxygen rocket engine. Additionally, the fiber was wrapped around coolant inlet pipes which were subject to near liquid hydrogen temperatures. Light from an LED was sent through the multimode fiber, and output power was monitored {{as a function of}} time while the engine was fired. The fiber showed no mechanical damage after 419 firings during which it was subject to transients from 30 K to 350 K, and total exposure time to near liquid hydrogen temperatures in excess of 990 seconds. These extreme temperatures did cause attenuation greater than 3 dB, but the signal was fully recovered at room temperature.

The {{equatorial}} {{ionospheric irregularities}} {{have been observed}} {{in the past few}} years by different techniques (e. g. ground-based radar, digisonde, GPS, optical instruments, in situ satellite and <b>rocket</b> <b>instrumentation),</b> and its time evolution and propagation characteristics can be used to study important aspects of ionospheric dynamics and thermosphere-ionosphere coupling.

The monochromatic OI 630 nm emission images usually show quasi-north-south magnetic field-aligned intensity depletion bands, which are the bottomside optical signatures of largescale F-region plasma irregularities (also called plasma bubbles).

40|$|The Open/Closed eld line Boundary (OCB) is {{the most}} {{important}} boundary in the magnetospheric system. On the dayside, the equatorward edge of the 6300 Å[OI] cusp aurora {{can be used as a}} proxy for the OCB. This work, which is a dissertation for the degree of philosophiæ Doctor consists of three scienti c papers focusing on the latitude of the optical cusp OCB and one paper focusing on polar cap patch generation mechanisms in the vicinity of the OCB. In Paper I we use modeling to demonstrate the variability of the cusp aurora with respect to vertical volume emission rate pro les and horizontal modulation owing to neutral wind. A meridian scanning photometer (MSP) simulator has been developed in order to study the manifestation of the cusp aurora in the MSP data from Svalbard. A method for obtaining the OCB location and nding the correct mapping altitude in order to transform the OCB location from MSP scan angle to magnetic latitude is found by simulating the horizontal movement of a reference cusp aurora. The reference cusp aurora, which is based on expected ionospheric and atmospheric conditions and electron precipitation characteristics, is de ned from the modeling results. Uncertainties in the scan angle to magnetic latitude transformation are found by simulating a wide range of realistic cusp auroras deviating from the reference cusp aurora. In Paper II the method of Paper I for finding the OCB is tested on real MSP data and compared with the OCB as obtained by satellite energetic particle measurements with very successful results. In Paper III the method of Paper I is used on 15 years of MSP data from Svalbard in order to study the statistical behavior of the cusp OCB. A possible relationship between the OCB latitude in the cusp and the solar cycle is revealed, and a possible expansion is brie y discussed. By comparing the OCB latitude with solar wind parameters, solar wind-magnetosphere coupling functions and geomagnetic indices, good correlations are found, which are in concurrence with previous satellite based, statistical studies. We nd a relationship between the OCB latitude and the ring current density (SYM/H), demonstrating great complexity in the physics behind the OCB location. We argue that the balance between reconnection dynamics on the dayside and nightside as well as the history or integral of previous events in the magnetospheric system are important factors for governing the cusp OCB latitude.

Unlike SRP 1 this rocket will have a centralized power supply. I am responsible for deciding the voltages supplied by the regulator board. In addition, I fabricated and tested the battery power supply and regulator board. Some background in the mission of this current rocket is necessary to define the scope of my thesis. The mission statement of this project is to test the feasibility of tracking sounding rockets in real-time using an on board Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, and including the following instrumentation: dual microprocessor-based telemetry system, internal and external temperature transducers, an accelerometer, and a pressure sensor. As the systems integrator for this sounding <b>rocket</b> <b>instrumentation</b> payload, I will be incorporating the designs of several people into a functional instrument package. Integration of the payload involves more than connecting the components together, it also requires making the amalgamation work as a unit with no ill side effects. Since the payload will be exposed to a harsh environment (i. e. one in which electrical arcing, component depressurization, electrical faults at joints, and thermal runaway are all possibilities), it is critical that proper testing take place. As part of my thesis, I will be proposing methods of testing the boards by simulating the conditions they will encounter in flight in the laboratory. Within the scope of this thesis, I will be reporting the results of the integrated system tests. [...] In amalgamating systems designed by a group of people, some interpersonal and managerial skills are required to successfully bring the payload together. This project draws on my experience as a senior in electrical engineering and as a design team leader for the Student Rocket Project [...] My final report will contain: [...] • design and fabrication procedures for the battery pack and regulation boards [...] • design and fabrication procedures for the integration of the payload [...] • testing procedures and their results for the power supply [...] • testing procedures and their results for the integrated payload [...] • discussion of other options for executing the above tasks [...] • documentation contributed by the other designers [...] Design, fabrication, testing and documentation of a rocket payload draws on the talents of the team members.

This work, which is a dissertation for the degree of philosophiæ Doctor consists of three scienti c papers focusing on the latitude of the optical cusp OCB and one paper focusing on polar cap patch generation mechanisms in the vicinity of the OCB. In Paper I we use modeling to demonstrate the variability of the cusp aurora with respect to vertical volume emission rate pro les and horizontal modulation owing to neutral wind. A meridian scanning photometer (MSP) simulator has been developed in order to study the manifestation of the cusp aurora in the MSP data from Svalbard. A method for obtaining the OCB location and nding the correct mapping altitude in order to transform the OCB location from MSP scan angle to magnetic latitude is found by simulating the horizontal movement of a reference cusp aurora. The reference cusp aurora, which is based on expected ionospheric and atmospheric conditions and electron precipitation characteristics, is de ned from the modeling results. Uncertainties in the scan angle to magnetic latitude transformation are found by simulating a wide range of realistic cusp auroras deviating from the reference cusp aurora. In Paper II the method of Paper I for finding the OCB is tested on real MSP data and compared with the OCB as obtained by satellite energetic particle measurements with very successful results. In Paper III the method of Paper I is used on 15 years of MSP data from Svalbard in order to study the statistical behavior of the cusp OCB. A possible relationship between the OCB latitude in the cusp and the solar cycle is revealed, and a possible expansion is brie y discussed. By comparing the OCB latitude with solar wind parameters, solar wind-magnetosphere coupling functions and geomagnetic indices, good correlations are found, which are in concurrence with previous satellite based, statistical studies. We nd a relationship between the OCB latitude and the ring current density (SYM/H), demonstrating great complexity in the physics behind the OCB location. We argue that the balance between reconnection dynamics on the dayside and nightside as well as the history or integral of previous events in the magnetospheric system are important factors for governing the cusp OCB latitude. Paper IV gives an overview of the solar wind and ionospheric conditions as measured during the Investigation of Cusp Irregularities 2 sounding rocket campaign. The rocket was launched through a newly produced polar cap patch. Based on the measurements performed in-situ by the <b>rocket</b> <b>instrumentation</b> and with groundbased optics and radars, a new creation mechanism, which partly involves ionization by both particle precipitation and solar irradiation and upwelling from sub F-layer altitudes, is suggested...|$|E
