50|$|The {{yellow-crowned bishop}} was first {{described}} by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1789. It and the fire-fronted bishop have occasionally been placed in the separate genus Taha but DNA places it in Euplectes, without close relatives however. In captivity it has interbred with the northern <b>red</b> <b>bishop.</b> Alternate common names include: Golden bishop, Napoleon <b>bishop,</b> Napoleon <b>weaver,</b> black-winged golden <b>bishop,</b> goudgeelvink (in Afrikaans), Napoleonwever (in Dutch), euplecte vorabé (in French), Napoleonweber (in German), and obispo coronigualdo (in Spanish).|$|R
50|$|A {{study of}} the {{molecular}} phylogeny of bishops and widowbirds published in 2008 found that it formed part of a clade along with the fire-fronted bishop (E. diadematus), black-winged <b>red</b> <b>bishop</b> (E. hordeaceus), northern <b>red</b> <b>bishop</b> (E. franciscanus), southern <b>red</b> <b>bishop</b> (E. orix), Zanzibar <b>red</b> <b>bishop</b> (E. nigroventris) and red-collared widowbird (E. ardens). An alternate common name is Gierow's bishop.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} <b>red</b> <b>bishop</b> or <b>red</b> <b>bishop</b> (Euplectes orix) {{is a small}} passerine bird {{belonging to}} the bishop and widowbird genus Euplectes in the weaver family, the Ploceidae. It is common in wetlands and grassland in Africa south of the Equator. North of the Equator, it is replaced by the northern <b>red</b> <b>bishop</b> or orange bishop (E. franciscanus) which was formerly regarded as a subspecies of this species.|$|R
50|$|Breeding {{males of}} the {{northern}} <b>red</b> <b>bishop</b> have a <b>red</b> throat, black extending further back on the crown and long tail-coverts which almost cover the tail.

50|$|The {{northern}} <b>red</b> <b>bishop</b> is {{a stocky}} 13-15 cm. bird. The breeding male is scarlet {{apart from his}} black head and waistcoat, and brown wings and tail. The conical bill is thick and black.|$|R

50|$|When Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert first {{described}} the red-collared widowbird from a South African specimen in 1783, he named it Fringilla ardens, assigning it to a genus of Old World finches. In 1829, William John Swainson created Euplectes, {{and moved the}} widowbirds and bishops from Fringilla into this new genus. Traditionally, Euplectes is thought to contain two clades, with the bishops in one clade and the widowbirds in another. However, molecular {{evidence suggests that the}} red-collared widowbird is actually a long-tailed bishop rather than a true widowbird. In captivity, they have been successfully bred with southern <b>red</b> <b>bishop,</b> yellow-mantled widowbird, fan-tailed widowbird, and black-winged <b>red</b> <b>bishop.</b>|$|R
50|$|The male in {{breeding}} plumage resembles the yellow bishop, but the latter species is larger and lacks the yellow crown. Non-breeding {{males and females}} can be confused {{with those of the}} southern <b>red</b> <b>bishop,</b> but have white rather than the buff-coloured underparts of the latter.|$|R
50|$|The non-breeding male is yellow-brown, {{streaked}} {{above and}} shading to whitish below. It has a whitish supercilium. It resembles non-breeding male northern <b>red</b> <b>bishop,</b> but is darker and has black wings. Females are similar, but paler. Young birds have wider pale fringes on their flight feathers.|$|R
50|$|The black-winged <b>red</b> <b>bishop</b> is {{a stocky}} 13-15 cm bird. The {{breeding}} male is scarlet {{apart from his}} black face, belly and wings and brown tail. The conical bill is thick and black. He displays prominently, singing high-pitched twitters from tall grass, puffing out his feathers or performing a slow hovering display flight.|$|R

5000|$|The {{northern}} <b>red</b> <b>bishop</b> displays prominently, singing high-pitched squeaks from tall grass, puffing out his feathers or {{performing a}} slow hovering display flight. It builds a spherical woven nest in tall grass. Two to four eggs are laid. This weaver is a gregarious species which feeds on seed, grain and some insects, {{all the time}} making a thin [...] tsip call.|$|R
50|$|Outside of {{breeding}} season, the males sport plumage that is considerably more drab, brown overall with some dark streaks and a cream-colored belly. The females {{have the same}} plumage year-round, which resembles that of the off-season males. The males of this species are often confused with males of the species Euplectes orix, {{commonly known as the}} southern <b>red</b> <b>bishop.</b> This bird has a black belly, however.|$|R
50|$|Red-collared widowbirds feed on {{seeds of}} sorghum and other grass seeds. They also feed on nectar, small berries, and insects, {{specifically}} ants, caterpillars, and termites. They often form large roosts, with between 50 and 100 individuals, which feed {{together on the}} ground. These roosts included breeding males. They are often formed with association with other species, like red-billed quelea, fan-tailed widowbird, southern <b>red</b> <b>bishop,</b> white-winged widowbird, and yellow bishop.|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>red</b> <b>bishop</b> is {{a resident}} breeding bird species in Africa {{south of the}} Sahara Desert and north of the Equator. It has been introduced to Puerto Rico, Martinique and Guadeloupe in the West Indies. It is also naturalized in California, where numbers have grown from scattered sightings in the 1970s to estimates of more than 400 by 1997, and in Texas, {{where there is a}} suspected breeding population in Harris County.|$|R
5000|$|The white-winged widowbird {{was first}} {{described}} by the American ornithologist John Cassin in 1848. Hybrids with [...] "red bishops", probably northern <b>red</b> <b>bishop</b> (E. franciscanus), {{have been reported in}} captivity. Non-captive interbreeding of race eques with nominate appears to occur in southern Tanzania, but they appear to stay segregated in Burundi and western Tanzania. A proposal has been made for race sassii, which is found along the northwestern shore of Lake Tanganyika. Alternate common names include: white-fronted/white-shouldered widowbird, white-winged/white-shouldered whydah, long-tailed black whydah.|$|R

40|$|We tested two {{substances}} (oxytetracycline and rhodamine B) {{that can}} be added to food or water of free-living birds, and serve as markers in their plumage for later identification. Oxytetracycline produced no detectable changes in the plumage of <b>red</b> <b>bishops</b> or redbilled queleas. Rhodamine B fed to captive birds produced fluorescence in the wing feathers when viewed under ultraviolet light. This fluorescence lasted for at least 14 weeks, and was retained until feathers were moulted. Rhodamine B may thus be useful in identifying birds using a specific feeding site, and for studies of moult and feather growth...|$|R

Verloren Vallei also includes animals such as the oribi, steenbok, brown hyena, caracal, serval cat, jackal, otters and zebras, wildebeest and blesbok have been reintroduced. But {{the stars of the}} show at Verloren Vallei Nature Reserve are the butterflies - attracted to the array of indigenous flowers - the sweet water and, of course, the cranes.|$|R
50|$|Upwards of 170 native {{bird species}} have been recorded, but the {{presence}} or breeding of some have been transient, due to urbanization and other factors. Resident or visiting passerine birds include thick-billed <b>weaver,</b> southern <b>red</b> <b>bishop,</b> African reed-warbler, little rush-warbler and lesser swamp-warbler. Various heron species visit the reserve, including black-crowned night-heron, little bittern, green-backed heron, purple heron, black and little egret. Other regular water birds are red-knobbed coot, fulvous duck, Egyptian goose, white-faced duck, Cape teal and southern pochard. Pinioned crowned cranes and blue cranes have been released into the reserve, and some exotic duck species are present.|$|R
