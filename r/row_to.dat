5|$|For {{the fourth}} season in a row, South Melbourne reached the Grand Final, only to lose, {{for the third}} season in a <b>row,</b> <b>to</b> Collingwood {{for the second time}} in a row. Nash kicked one goal in the Grand Final and was adjudged one of South's best players but Collingwood's Jack Ross's dogged tagging of Nash {{throughout}} the match was considered the decisive factor in Collingwood's win.|$|E

After Joe's death, Bonnie's daughter, Monica, took over from him. But Mullen gave up the lessons and started playing by himself. His mother died in a car accident in 1976.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round of the Masters, Murphy came back from 2–4 behind to defeat Ding Junhui 6–4.

He faced defending champion Mark Selby in the semi-finals, but lost 1–6.|$|E

Magna Carta Holy Grail also became Jay-Z's 13th studio album in a <b>row</b> <b>to</b> top the Billboard 200, extending his record for the most chart-toppers by a solo act in Billboards history.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2008–09 season, Central Coast was {{predicted}} {{to be among}} the A-League leaders, but had a run of three losses in a <b>row</b> <b>to</b> end the regular season.

Central Coast lost 4–1 on aggregate in their minor semi-final against Queensland Roar, ending the team's season.|$|E

5|$|Following a {{deliberate}} break from media scrutiny, Williams released his seventh album Rudebox in October 2006 to great public anticipation. Despite a lukewarm critical reception, it matched the chart success of its predecessors, becoming Williams' seventh album in a <b>row</b> <b>to</b> reach {{number one in}} the United Kingdom and spawning the UK number-four single of the same name. The album, however, sold far fewer copies in the UK than his record label EMI had predicted.|$|E

Iraq was qualified {{for the second time in}} the <b>row</b> <b>to</b> the Summer Olympics where Saeed scored Iraq's only goal in the first match, against Canada, in the 83rd minute of a 1–1 draw. He also scored a goal in Iraq's defeat against Yugoslavia 4–2. Iraq were knocked out of the competition after drawing a game and losing the other two.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{start to}} the season saw Arsenal top the league table after four matches. The team's draw at Manchester United in September marked an unsavoury episode between both clubs: several Arsenal players were charged and fined {{accordingly}} by The Football Association for their part in a mass brawl that occurred after the match. In November, Arsenal beat Dynamo Kyiv by a single goal and more impressively scored five against Inter Milan at the San Siro – two results which kick-started their Champions League campaign. At {{the turn of the}} year, the team won nine league matches in a <b>row</b> <b>to</b> consolidate first position. In the first week of April, they were eliminated from the FA Cup and Champions League, {{but by the end of}} the month had secured their status as league champions, with a 2–2 draw against local rivals Tottenham Hotspur.|$|E

5|$|Adding a {{multiple}} of any <b>row</b> <b>to</b> another row, or {{a multiple}} of any column to another column, {{does not change the}} determinant. Interchanging two rows or two columns affects the determinant by multiplying it by −1. Using these operations, any matrix can be transformed to a lower (or upper) triangular matrix, and for such matrices the determinant equals the product of the entries on the main diagonal; this provides a method to calculate the determinant of any matrix. Finally, the Laplace expansion expresses the determinant in terms of minors, that is, determinants of smaller matrices. This expansion can be used for a recursive definition of determinants (taking as starting case the determinant of a 1-by-1 matrix, which is its unique entry, or even the determinant of a 0-by-0 matrix, which is 1), that can be seen to be equivalent to the Leibniz formula. Determinants can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer's rule, where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system's variables.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} Matchette Road, where ramps {{provide access}} {{to and from the}} eastbound and westbound lanes of the expressway, respectively, the opposing lanes of the expressway split to the south of Malden Park. The eastbound lanes diverge south and cross the Herb Gray Parkway, sandwiching it between the E. C Row Expressway. Ramps provide access between the two parallel freeways before the parkway diverges and travels under the E. C. <b>Row</b> <b>to</b> the west of Huron Church Road. The expressway curves east-northeast and crosses Huron Church and becomes sandwiched between residential subdivisions. After interchanges with Dominion Boulevard and Dougall Avenue, the route crosses the Canadian National (CN) Caso subdivision railway lines and briefly passes through an industrial area.|$|E
5|$|After losing two {{finals in}} a <b>row</b> <b>to</b> Bellaghy in 1999 and 2000, Ballinderry won the 2001 Derry Championship, once again {{defeating}} Bellaghy in the decider. The club {{went on to}} win the 2001 Ulster Club Championship with victories over St. Gall's in the quarter-final (after a replay), Cavan Gaels in the semi-final and Mayobridge in the final. Muldoon was awarded Ulster Football Award Winner at the AIB GAA Provincial Player Awards 2001 for his role in Ballinderry's march to claim the Ulster Club Championship. He was presented his award by GAA President Seán McCague. Ballinderry went on to represent Ulster in the All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship, which they won defeating Tír Chonaill Gaels (London) in the quarter-final, Rathnew (Wicklow) in the semi-final and Nemo Rangers (Cork) in the final. Muldoon played through the pain barrier in the Championship, delaying an operation on a troublesome hip injury until after the All-Ireland final.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{were now}} 02 down {{and needed to}} win three Tests in a <b>row</b> <b>to</b> retain the Ashes. The {{pressure}} on McCabe increased when last-minute injuries meant {{that he had to}} open the bowling. McCabe made 63 and 22 and took a wicket as Australia won their first match in the series. He then top-scored with 88 in Australia's first innings of 288 and made 55 in the second as Australia won by 148 runs in the Fourth Test in Adelaide to level the series. In the deciding Test at the MCG, McCabe scored 112, one of three centuries as Australia amassed 604, a record score in Ashes Tests in Australia. This laid the platform for the innings victory that retained the Ashes. McCabe aggregated 491 runs in five Tests at 54.55, with a century and five fifties in a consistent display.|$|E
5|$|In August 1994, DGC {{announced}} that a double album titled Verse Chorus Verse featuring live material from throughout the group's career on one CD and its MTV Unplugged performance on another was due for release that November. However, Novoselic and Grohl found assembling the live material so soon after Cobain's death to be too emotionally overwhelming. Grohl founded the Foo Fighters, and Novoselic {{turned his attention to}} political activism. With the career-spanning live portion postponed, MTV Unplugged in New York debuted at number one on the Billboard charts upon release in November 1994. A few weeks later the group's first full-length video, Live! Tonight! Sold Out!!, was released. The following year, MTV Unplugged in New York earned Nirvana a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album. In 1996, DGC finally issued a Nirvana live album, From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah, which became the third Nirvana release in a <b>row</b> <b>to</b> debut {{at the top of the}} Billboard album chart.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa had {{meanwhile}} instructed Toho {{to purchase}} the film rights to King's Ransom, a novel about a kidnapping written by American author and screenwriter Evan Hunter, under his pseudonym of Ed McBain, {{as one of his}} 87th Precinct series of crime books. The director intended to create a work condemning kidnapping, which he considered one of the very worst crimes. The suspense film, titled High and Low, was shot during the latter half of 1962 and released in March 1963. It broke Kurosawa's box office record (the third film in a <b>row</b> <b>to</b> do so), became the highest grossing Japanese film of the year, and won glowing reviews. However, his triumph was somewhat tarnished when, ironically, the film was blamed for a wave of kidnappings which occurred in Japan about this time (he himself received kidnapping threats directed at his young daughter, Kazuko). High and Low is considered by many commentators to be among the director's strongest works.|$|E
