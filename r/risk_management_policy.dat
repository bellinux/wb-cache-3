They involve recommendations such as the minimization of cellphone usage, the limitation of use by at-risk population (such as children), the adoption of cellphones and microcells with as low as reasonably practicable levels of radiation, the wider use of hands-free and earphone technologies such as Bluetooth headsets, the adoption of maximal standards of exposure, RF field intensity and distance of base stations antennas from human habitations, and so forth. Overall, public information remains a challenge as various health consequences are evoked in the literature and by the media, putting populations under chronic exposure to potentially worrying information.|$|E

Its focus is placed on the consistency of <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>policies</b> and on their ability to deal with the challenges, present and future, created by systemic risks. It is designed in two phases. In Phase 1, the countries participating in the project propose specific themes as case studies of their <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>policies.</b> For each proposal, the OECD Secretariat prepares an overview of the issue covering both recent international developments of interest and the national policy context. In addition, the Secretariat elaborates a tool for self-assessment and review, consisting of one or several questionnaires following the methodological framework of the project. This prepares the ground for Phase 2 in which an in-depth review of the <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> issues will be conducted by a team of experts for those countries that wish it.

40|$|The current {{liquidity}} challenges being {{experienced in}} the banking sector and the economy, continue {{to be an issue}} of major concern to the Zimbabwean citizens. It is in an effort to try and establish {{one of the reasons that}} could be contributing to these challenges that prompted the researcher to investigate the effects of board independence on liquidity <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> in the Zimbabwean banking sector. Literature on board independence and its implication in decision making in the banking sector and other sectors, brought out different views among researchers on the extent to which board independence can influence the kind of decisions made at the highest decision- making body in the banking sector. It is within the believe that such decisions to do with <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>policies</b> are also made. Liquidity <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>policies</b> were also explored. The researcher made of questionnaires and in-depth interviews and desktop research to collect data. This dissertation presents findings from a research covering twenty seven (27) out of thirty (30) respondents, representing a ninety percent (90 %) response rate. The findings revealed that Zimbabwean banks are still not observing board independence. Not much has been done by the Central banks to ensure compliance. The findings also revealed that most banks are not compliant with the liquidity <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>policies</b> as stipulated by the Basel committee of bank supervision. For the few banks that are now compliant, the policies and frameworks have not been fully implemented to the rest of the bank employees. The failure of banks to implement such major policies in corporate governance and <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> has weakened the bank positions in managing liquidity. It is therefore the researcherâ€™s recommendations that board independence be viewed from the level of the Reserve bank down to the individual banks. It is the researcherâ€™s believe that a number of incorrect decisions being made at these board rooms can be avoided. There is also urgent need for the implementation of <b>risk</b> <b>management</b> <b>policies</b> bank wide...|$|R
