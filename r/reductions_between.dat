Roughly 10,000 baby boomers retire {{every day in the}} United States which removes many talented and experienced workers from the medical field each year. The demographic shift to an older population is projected to increase medical spending in North America by at least 5%, creating a funding crunch that the government (through medicare and other social services), insurance companies, and individual savings accounts are straining to absorb. Finally, the older population is rapidly increasing demand for healthcare services despite the tight budgets and reduced workforce.
