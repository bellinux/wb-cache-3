2500|$|For many years, {{virtually}} all of the perishable traffic in the United States was carried by the railroads. While railroads were subject to government regulation regarding shipping rates, trucking companies could set their own rate for hauling agricultural products, giving them a competitive advantage. In March 1979, the ICC exempted rail transportation of fresh fruits and vegetables from all economic regulation. Once the [...] "Agricultural Exemption Clause" [...] was removed from the Interstate Commerce Act, railroads began aggressively pursuing trailer-on-flatcar (TOFC) business (a form of intermodal freight transport) for <b>refrigerated</b> <b>trailers.</b> Taking this one step further, a number of carriers (including the PFE and SFRD) purchased their own <b>refrigerated</b> <b>trailers</b> to compete with interstate trucks.|$|R

40|$|The {{distribution}} of fresh and frozen foods requires {{the use of}} refrigerated trailers. In addition, Reliability and Maintainability (RAM) is an important issue in the operation of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>trailer</b> fleets. Often, as trailers age, their reliability decreases. This study explores the optimization of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>trailer</b> retirement and job assignment under consideration of container aging and usage. By achieving this objective, Tyson and other organizations that operate similar refrigerated transportation systems know when to retire the trailers and how to assign trailer duty. Also, a better understanding of RAM performance of <b>refrigerated</b> <b>trailer</b> fleets is obtained. We began by collecting maintenance history for 195 trailers. The data covers the period January 1, 1994 to March 2, 2001. We categorized the trailers as a series system comprised of five major subsystems: refrigeration, engine, tire, wheel assembly, and structure. Next, from the maintenance history data, time between failure data for each subsystem for each trailer was collected. Given the time between failure data, we used the Weibull ++ software package and maximum likelihood estimation to model the reliability performance of refrigerate...|$|E

40|$|Thermo King as a {{supplier}} of {{mobile refrigeration equipment}} is interested in {{more information about the}} airflow distribution inside a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>trailer</b> in various loading conditions to optimise the performance of the refrigeration units. A more efficient way and/or more uniform way of keeping the internal environment inside the refrigerated box at the required conditions will increase the quality of the cargo as well as causing less damage to the environment. The objective of this project is to develop a testing environment that makes it possible to conduct airflow tests for the purpose of learning more about the internal airflow of a trailer. This test environment will be {{in the form of an}} hydraulic transparent test rig representing a scaled model o f a refrigeration system. The test environment must be able to simulate multiple unit configurations in the form of different airflow volumes, and different configurations of air inlet and outlet positions. Different cargo configurations inside the trailer will be used to simulate different types of loads. Secondly, advice and recommendations on the improvement of airflow as well as ideas for further research will be discussed. It is recommended that the project be continued by future researchers to obtain more extensive results from the simulation environment developed and created during this project. Real flow investigation and improvement in airflow distribution should be developed and tested to enable Thermo King to make a more efficient, competitive and more environmentally friendly refrigeration unit...|$|E
40|$|The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) is {{an insect}} native to {{tropical}} and subtropical regions in Asia, which has spread into most citrus producing regions around the world.   The main concern with ACP is {{the spread of}} Huanglongbing (HLB), a disease vectored by the psyllid. The volume of citrus shipments from Mexico into the U. S. prompted questions {{about the risk of}} moving ACP and HLB on this pathway.   Our goal was to determine temperatures at which ACP would be active and thus fly to lighted sticky traps inside a transport trailer. Our results found that temperature significantly affected the number of adults captured.   No psyllids were recovered on the traps at 12 ˚C (53 ˚F), which is the average temperature of citrus shipments crossing the border.   This is compare with an average capture of 43, 47, and 42 % of the released adults at 24, 28, and 32 °C (75, 82, and 90 °F), respectively.   Only 1 %, 2 % and 18 % were captured at 18, 20 and 22 °C (64, 68, and 72 ˚F), respectively.   Given that the average temperature of limes arriving at the border is 12 ˚C, it is unlikely that ACP adults would fly to a lighted sticky trap placed inside a <b>refrigerated</b> <b>trailer.</b>   In addition, the majority of the packing houses in Mexico place the fruit into coolers prior to loading. We believe a lighted sticky trap would not be effective in detecting ACP within refrigerated citrus shipments for the period of time from loading at the packing house to trap recovery at the border crossing...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Fresh {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} experience losses enroute to market that are caused by mechanical injuries. Past {{studies have indicated that}} transit vibration contributes to this loss, and may be more important than impacts as a source of damage. In cross-country tests of cherries, nectarines, and pears in semi-trailers equipped with steel-spring suspension systems, highest Power Spectral Density (PSD) levels were found at about 3. 5 Hz. In this study, PSD is used to mean acceleration spectral density. Other frequencies with high PSD levels were 9, 18, and 25 Hz, Similar results were found in tests with fresh tomatoes. However, in trailers equipped with an air-ride suspension and loaded with tomatoes, the PSD levels were attenuated at 3. 5 Hz, and were reduced at other frequencies. The highest PSD levels were found {{at the rear of the}} trailer, with resonance in the loaded boxes occurring at some frequencies. Horizontal acceleration was much less than the vertical acceleration. Understanding acceleration levels and frequencies that occur during shipment of perishables in <b>refrigerated</b> <b>trailers</b> will help to determine methods that will dampen the vibration energy and reduce the present losses in produce quality...|$|R
50|$|Another {{reason that}} future {{security}} threats or losses are under-assessed is that often only the direct {{cost of a}} potential loss is considered instead of the spectrum of consequential losses that are concomitantly experienced. For example, the vandalism-destruction of a custom production machine in a factory or of a <b>refrigerated</b> tractor <b>trailer</b> {{would result in a}} long replacement time during which customers could not be served, resulting in loss of their business. A violent crime will have extensive public relations damage for an employer, beyond the direct liability for failing to protect the employee.|$|R

500|$|As {{the company}} grew, it split its {{production}} operations, with the Harrisburg location mixing {{the ice cream}} and a new facility in Lower Swatara Township used for the actual hardening and packaging of the product. While local orders continued to be delivered in small Hershey's Ice Cream refrigerated trucks, the company shifted to transporting most of its ice cream to <b>refrigerated</b> tractor <b>trailer</b> trucks, enabling it to stretch its market beyond the state of Pennsylvania. It expanded its distribution facilities, eventually occupying 22 co-owned distribution centers. This enabled the company to ship products out more quickly after orders are received and resulted in less travel time for the products, ensuring freshness and quality were maintained. In the summer months, the company greatly increased its workforce and leased additional cold-storage space to help meet the seasonal orders, as the orders were prepared by hand. In 1998, operations were modernized and automated when the company purchased [...] in nearby Middletown where it constructed a modern 1.3 million cubic foot warehouse, enabling it to boost its efficiency, reducing the need to increase its summer workforce, and reducing the frequent product loss caused by hand orders and inefficient packing systems. The modernization of its warehouse also improved inventory management, order accuracy, and has helped the company continue its growth.|$|R
