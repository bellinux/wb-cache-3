5|$|A CNN film crew, {{who were}} there on a <b>routine</b> <b>check</b> for a {{possible}} Falun Gong protest, observed a man sitting down on the pavement northeast of the Monument to the People's Heroes at {{the centre of the}} square.

Shortly afterwards, another four people on the square set themselves alight. One of the four, a man, was detained and driven away in a police van.|$|E
5|$|Konrad Kujau {{was born}} in 1938 in Löbau, near Dresden, in what would become East Germany. His parents, a {{shoemaker}} and his wife, had both joined the Nazi Party in 1933. The boy grew up believing in the Nazi ideals and idolising Hitler; Germany's defeat and Hitler's suicide in 1945 did not temper his enthusiasm for the Nazi cause. He {{held a series of}} menial jobs until 1957, when a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with the theft of a microphone from the Löbau Youth Club. He fled to Stuttgart, West Germany, and soon drifted into temporary work and petty crime. After running a dance bar during the early 1960s with his girlfriend, Edith Lieblang—whom he later married—Kujau began to create a fictional background for himself. He told people that his real name was Peter Fischer, changed his date of birth by two years, and altered the story of his time in East Germany. By 1963 the bar had begun to suffer financial difficulties, and Kujau started his career as a counterfeiter, forging 27 Deutsche Marks' (DM) worth of luncheon vouchers; he was caught and sentenced to five days in prison. On his release he and his wife formed the Lieblang Cleaning Company, although it provided little income for them. In March 1968, at a <b>routine</b> <b>check</b> at Kujau's lodgings, the police established he was living under a false identity and he was sent to Stuttgart's Stammheim Prison.|$|E

2500|$|The Hells Angels became {{involved}} in a dispute between a Dutch drug trafficker and a Liverpool crime family in late 1992. The Liverpudlian gang had made a significant {{down payment on a}} large shipment of cannabis from Amsterdam which was seized by British customs officials during a <b>routine</b> <b>check</b> of a Dutch-registered ship docking at Manchester. Under the terms of the agreement, the drugs were no longer the responsibility of the Dutchman once they had left Dutch waters but the Liverpool family refused to pay the £140,000 owed and so the trafficker, a former Hells Angel, contracted the club to collect the debt owed to him. Three Hells Angels, Michael [...] "Long Mick" [...] Rowledge (vice-president of the Hells Angels' Wolverhampton chapter), Andrew Trevis (also from Wolverhampton) and Stephen Pollock (from the Windsor chapter) travelled to Aintree on October 7, 1992 and agreed to meet the Liverpudlians outside a supermarket in the Old Roan area. While the Hells Angels waited in their car, a gunman approached and shot Rowledge four times in the chest, killing him, before escaping in a waiting vehicle. In 1993, Delroy Davies was acquitted after a trial at Liverpool Crown Court and Thomas Dures was jailed for 13 years for conspiracy to murder.|$|E

2500|$|The Rogues are reconstituted {{with a new}} {{membership}} of Heat Wave, Mirror Master, Captain Cold, Abra Kadabra, Weather Wizard, Trickster and Pied Piper, led by Inertia. Several Rogues distrust Trickster and Piper as they have reformed in the past. The Rogues plan to and eventually succeed in, killing the Flash, Bart Allen. Piper and Trickster then go on the run following Bart's murder, but attend his funeral, where they are captured by Multiplex and Deadshot. Eventually escaping, they are later pursued in Gotham City by the Suicide Squad (composed of Deadshot, Bronze Tiger, Plastique and Captain Boomerang, Jr.) and later Oracle's dispatches: the Question and Batwoman, villainous duo Poison Ivy and Deathstroke, and eventually Batman and Wally West himself, on his vendetta against the Rogues who he believes killed his cousin Bart. Piper and Trickster attempt to tell Wally that they overheard Deathstroke's plans to murder the attendees at Black Canary and Green Arrow's wedding, but are internally attacked by Deathstroke's tracking device. Flash manages to remove the explosive implants and brings {{the two of them}} to Zatanna's home. Flash confiscates the duo's weapons. However, Trickster and Piper use Zatanna's mummy bodyguard Hassan to create a distraction and escape Black Canary's bachelorette party. They then find himself {{in the middle of a}} battle on the wedding day and manage to use the Joker's exploding [...] "present" [...] against Poison Ivy, gaining some measure of revenge over her. As they escape in a stolen car, they are suddenly accosted by Double Down, who had hidden in the back seat. Double Down wants to join the two in their run from the law, mentioning the disappearances of several villains. The group is then attacked by the Suicide Squad. Double Down is defeated and captured, but Piper and Trickster, using Trickster's cloaking field, evade the squad and decide to follow them and free the other villains they have captured. They follow them to a government facility, and manage to free Two-Face. Two-Face tells them that Checkmate is behind the abductions. After flipping his coin, Two-Face declines to join the two. Piper and Trickster continue to flee, escaping capture by Deadshot. They are able to defeat Deadshot, but not before he manages to shoot the Trickster dead. The cord attaching them together detects that Trickster is dead and begins a fail-safe procedure, counting down from twenty-four hours until it detonates. Piper uses his flute to slow the countdown. The train they are on stops for a <b>routine</b> <b>check,</b> causing Piper to flee into the desert. Piper, delirious from the heat, begins to imagine Trickster's corpse is talking to him and removes Trickster's hand from his body to avoid triggering the bomb.|$|E

40|$|Background: No good {{evidence}} exists {{to support the}} practice of routinely checking for the nuchal cord, yet {{it is a common}} medical intervention in birth. Some evidence shows damage to the baby because the practice more frequently leads to premature cord-cutting and the vaginal examination, required by such <b>routine</b> <b>checking,</b> may be physically and/or emotionally damaging to the women. Our objective was to learn what training midwives have received and what their current practice is in relation to a possible nuchal cord at birth? Method: Questions about nuchal cord at birth were posted to two online midwifery discussion forums and responses were invited. Twenty-six midwives from 10 countries responded to questions on nuchal cord practices. Results: The teaching and practice of routinely checking for the nuchal cord at birth is widespread, according to at least some participants from all 10 countries. Other midwives from the same countries argued that, although they were aware that the procedure is the dominant midwifery practice, many midwives neither teach it nor perform it routinely. Conclusion: In the absence ofclear evidence, firmly entrenched positions are being argued for and against <b>routine</b> <b>checking.</b> The debate is infused with high emotion. Those arguing for <b>routine</b> <b>checking</b> cite safety for the baby as their main concern. Those arguing against checking cite the need to keep birth normal and the well-being of the baby as their primary concerns. There is a need to reconsider how the possibility of nuchal cord at birth should be conceptualised from a midwifery perspective to ensure woman-centred decision-making...|$|R
