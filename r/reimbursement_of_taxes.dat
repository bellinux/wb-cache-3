40|$|Increasing {{concern in}} {{scientific}} and policy making circles {{about the possibility}} of global warming induced by the accumulation of CO 2 and other GHGs in the atmosphere has advanced for consideration of policies to limit emissions of these GHGs. This paper gives an overview of policy instruments that might be used to control CO 2 emissions, including command-and-control approach, energy taxes, carbon taxes, and tradeable carbon permits, with special attention paid to the economic instruments. It highlights the differences between energy taxes and carbon <b>taxes</b> in terms <b>of</b> target achievement. It presents some main findings arising from those studies on carbon taxes, with the emphasis placed on some aspects <b>of</b> domestic carbon <b>tax</b> design and incidence. The allocations of emission permits (or <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> carbon <b>tax</b> revenues) are also discussed. Moreover, a comparison <b>of</b> carbon <b>taxes</b> with tradeable carbon permits is briefly made. This paper ends with some conclusions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} issue of {{political}} feasibility of a road pricing policies (RPP). Referring to a literature developed in international trade theory (Fernandez and Rodrick, 1991), this paper presents a model regarding the role and relevance of individual specific uncertainty in explaining the political acceptability of RPP. It is shown that: a) without money transfers, i. e., <b>reimbursements</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tax</b> levied, and with no uncertainty, RPP might not be accepted thus giving rise to an evident trade-off between economic efficiency and political acceptability; b) when individual specific uncertainty is assumed, optimal level of RPP, may, under given conditions concerning the number of voters and people preferences, become politically acceptable. Two different strategies can be envisaged to render RPP politically feasible: gradual and radical. The first strategy foresees a low corrective tax that eliminates only {{a small proportion of}} the excessive use of the public good and provides an acceptable balance between monetary loss and environment improvement. Alternatively, a radical strategy would foresee a much higher level <b>of</b> <b>tax</b> substantially reducing the number of people consuming the public good and providing a potentially higher and concentrated payoff to those still consuming it after the policy is implemented. This latter policy appears more easily sustainable under majority than unanimity voting. ...|$|R
30|$|The strong {{incidence}} on the CPI and the accelerating inflation rates {{moved the}} government to intervene actively. Initially, in March 2005, government carried out a price agreement {{with the private sector}} attempting in vain to curb the price rise; in August, it imposed a minimum slaughter weight for live animals with objective to increase the supply of heavier animals; in November, the target was to restrict foreign sales, elevating export taxes to 15 %, and eliminating the export <b>reimbursements</b> <b>of</b> indirect <b>taxes</b> (5 %). In January 2006, an export registry system (ROE) 1 was created. The government office in charge of administering the system (ONCCA) 2 was given the power to extend an export authorization for each shipment, as a precondition to the custom clearance. Delays and arbitrary objections were later used as means to interfere and discourage operations. Furthermore, in March 2006, beef exports were initially banned for 180  days. Later on, a quantitative restriction policy was implemented, forcing beef packers to export only domestic market surpluses.|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Two {{opposing}} {{views of}} the human body have existed since time began. Can it be traded or does its value go beyond a monetary one? Today it is illegal to sell organs but the success of organ transplantation has give rise to an enormous controversy. The continued increase in the need for organs has lead to a major use of live donors. Consequently, clandestine selling of organs is becoming more widespread for two main reasons: scientific progress and market demand. Our aim was to consider the protection of ethical principles through legislation. Materials and methods. Based on the principle that it is morally unacceptable for people to die on a waiting list, we analysed various ways in which the National Health Service could give incentives to live donors, including <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> health expenses, <b>tax</b> relief, pension or early retirement benefits, or education grants for the children. Possible incentives for cadaveric organ donation included reimbursal of health and funeral costs, or increase in widow/er's pension. Conclusion. The tendency may be toward <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs rather than actual payments. A legal, ethical organ market could save thousands of human lives, but it must be correctly regulated...|$|R

The purpose of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive look at the issue <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in trial and enforcement proceedings. The thesis is composed of an introduction, two main sections which are dealing with <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in trial proceedings and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in the enforcement proceedings and conclusion.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to review the {{requirements}} for the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars and to compare the reimbursement status, market share, and <b>reimbursement</b> costs <b>of</b> biosimilars in selected Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted between November 2016 and January 2017 among experts from the following CEE countries: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania. The requirements for the pricing and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars were reviewed for each country. Data on the extent <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biologic drugs (separately for original products and biosimilars) in the years 2014 and 2015 were also collected for each country, along with data on the total pharmaceutical and total public health care budgets. Results: Our survey revealed that no specific criteria were applied for the pricing and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars in the selected CEE countries; the price of biosimilars was usually reduced compared with original drugs and specific price discounts were common. Substitution and interchangeability were generally allowed, although in most countries they were at the discretion of the physician after a clinical assessment. Original biologic drugs and the corresponding biosimilars were usually in the same homogeneous group, and internal reference pricing was usually employed. The <b>reimbursement</b> rate <b>of</b> biosimilars in the majority of the countries was the same and amounted to 100 %. Generally, the higher shares of expenditures were shown for the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> original drugs than for biosimilars, except for filgrastim, somatropin, and epoetin (alfa and zeta). The shares of expenditures on the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilar products ranged from 8. 0 % in Estonia in 2014 to 32. 4 % in Lithuania in 2015, and generally increased in 2015. The share <b>of</b> expenditures on <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars in the total pharmaceutical budget differed between the countries, with the highest observed value for Slovakia and Hungary and the lowest—for Croatia. Conclusions: The requirements for the pricing and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilar products as well as the access of patients to biologic treatment do not differ significantly between the considered CEE countries. Biosimilar drugs significantly influence the <b>reimbursement</b> systems <b>of</b> these countries, and the expenditure on the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars is increasing as they are becoming more accessible to patients...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the frequency <b>of</b> utilization and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> the common diagnostic tests and treatment modalities used in testicular cancer care. Methods: LifeLink™ (IMS Health, Danbury, CT, USA) Claims Database was used. We identified 877 subjects with a primary diagnosis of testicular cancer (ICD 186. 9) between 2007 and 2012. Median <b>reimbursement</b> and frequency <b>of</b> the diagnostic/treatment modalities used were recorded. Results: The most common claim was a vein puncture with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 9. 11. Tumor markers, alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotropin, were ranked 6 th and 7 th with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 52. 13 and $ 48. 71, respectively. Chest X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest were ranked 9 th and 13 th with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 68. 51 and $ 769, respectively. A contrast CT scan of abdomen and pelvis was the 11 th most frequent claim with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 855. 89. The three invasive treatment modalities, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy were ranked 8 th, 15 th, and 164 th with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 2858. 38, $ 3988. 25, and $ 2009. 67, respectively. Conclusions: Testicular cancer is not an inexpensive disease. Surgery is the less utilized than radiation and chemotherapy despite lower cost. This may have implications to national guidelines and training since these treatments often carry the same grade of recommendation...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is {{to point out}} the {{increase}} of the amount of the petty cases, to analyze its reasons, to describe the development of the relevant legislation and case law and to deal with some main legal arguments related to the issue <b>of</b> the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> the costs of proceedings in petty cases. The reason for my research is mainly its topicality and rapid evolution in a few past years. The boom of the mass claim recovery realized by the specialized "debt companies" was the reason of the legislative amendments and led to the ground-breaking decisions of the Constitutional Court, which resulted in the repeal of the regulation No. 484 / 2000 Coll. The thesis is composed of the introduction, four chapters and conclusion.
