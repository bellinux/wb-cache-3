50|$|The {{apparatus}} {{is usually}} made of glass, or sometimes of polyethylene, {{and consists of}} three vertically stacked chambers, roughly resembling a snowman. The upper chamber extends downward as a tube that passes through the middle chamber into the lower chamber. There is no direct path between {{the middle and upper}} chambers, but the middle chamber is separated from the lower chamber by a <b>retention</b> <b>plate,</b> such as a conical piece of glass with small holes, which permits the passage of liquid and gas. The solid material (e.g., iron sulfide) is placed into the middle chamber in lumps sufficiently large to avoid falling through the <b>retention</b> <b>plate.</b> The liquid, such as an acid, is poured into the top chamber. Although the acid is free to flow down through the tube into the bottom chamber, it is prevented from rising there by the pressure of the gas contained above it, which is able to leave the apparatus only by a stopcock {{near the top of the}} middle chamber. This stopcock may be opened, initially to permit the air to leave the apparatus, allowing the liquid in the bottom chamber to rise through the <b>retention</b> <b>plate</b> into the middle chamber and react with the solid material. Gas is evolved from this reaction, which may be drawn off through the stopcock as desired. When the stopcock is closed, the pressure of the evolved gas in the middle chamber rises and pushes the acid back down into the bottom chamber, until it is not in contact with the solid material anymore. At that point the chemical reaction comes to a stop, until the stopcock is opened again and more gas is drawn off.|$|E

In place of the stainless steel mesh and foil insulation that had been used on previous Magnox stations, a fibrous type of insulation supplied by Delaney Gallay, part of the Lindustries Group, had been used for the first time. During pre-operational trials, before the nuclear fuel was loaded, high levels of acoustic vibration in the gas circuit were found to be damaging the insulation tiles, and the <b>retention</b> <b>plates</b> which held the insulation in place had to be redesigned and modified within the reactor.|$|R

A comparison of HSA silica monoliths of various lengths indicated columns as short as 1 to 3 mm could be used to provide reproducible estimates of <b>retention</b> factors or <b>plate</b> heights. Benefits of using smaller columns for this work included the lower retention times and lower back pressures that could be obtained versus traditional HPLC affinity columns, as well as the smaller amount of protein that is required for column preparation. One disadvantage of decreasing column length was the lower precision that resulted in <b>retention</b> factor and <b>plate</b> height measurements. A comparison was also made between microcolumns containing silica particles versus silica monoliths. It was demonstrated with R-warfarin that supports could be used in HSA microcolumns for the determination of <b>retention</b> factors or <b>plate</b> heights.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to review recent {{randomized}} clinical trials (RCTs) dealing with the effectiveness of various modalities of orthopaedic/orthodontic expansion of maxillary arches with crossbite and the associated 6 month post retention stability. The study selection criteria included RCTs involving subjects with maxillary deficiency with crossbite, with no limits of age. The authors searched the following electronic databases from 1999 to January 2011 : the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, LILACS, and WEB of SCIENCE. The search strategy resulted in 12 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies did not meet major methodological requirements; some studies were not relevant because of small sample size, possible bias and unaccounted for confounding variables, lack of blinding in measurements, and deficient statistical methods. Treatment outcomes were different depending on the appliance used, tooth tissue-borne/tooth-borne expanders, bonded semi-rapid maxillary expansion (SRME), or rapid maxillary expansion (RME); in any case, methodological flaws prevent any sound conclusion. Stable results have been measured at the 6 month follow-up after removal of the <b>retention</b> <b>plate</b> in the treated groups in the maxillary intermolar and intercanine distances. Long-term stability results should be assessed. The Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement could be helpful in improving the reporting of RCTs...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Our aim in this {{prospective}} randomized {{clinical study}} {{was to assess the}} prevalence rate of eruption of palatally displaced canines, diagnosed at an early developmental stage with posteroanterior radiographs and consequently treated by rapid maxillary expansion. METHODS: A sample of 60 subjects in the early mixed dentition with palatally displaced canines diagnosed on posteroanterior radiographs was enrolled in the trial. Their age range at the first observation (T 1) was 7. 6 to 9. 6 years, with a prepubertal stage of skeletal maturity (CS 1 or CS 2). The 60 subjects were randomly allocated to the treatment group (TG, 35 subjects) or the no-treatment group (NTG, 25 subjects). The TG was treated with a banded rapid maxillary expander; after expansion, all patients were retained with the expander in place for 6 months. Thereafter, the expander was removed, and the patients wore a <b>retention</b> <b>plate</b> at night for a year. The NTG received no treatment. All subjects were reevaluated in the early permanent dentition (T 2) (postpubertal CS 4). The number of dropouts was recorded. The main outcome recorded at T 2 was successful or unsuccessful eruption of the maxillary permanent canines. The starting forms at T 1 for measurements on posteroanterior and panoramic films were compared in the 2 groups with the Mann-Whitney U test (P < 0. 05). The prevalence rates of successful and unsuccessful treatments in the TG were compared with those in NTG with chi-square tests (P < 0. 05). From T 1 to T 2, there were 3 dropouts in each group. RESULTS: The final sample comprised 32 subjects in the TG and 22 subjects in the NTG. No statistically significant differences were found for any variable at T 1.

40|$|The {{influence}} of pressure drop on <b>retention,</b> selectivity, <b>plate</b> height and resolution was investigated systematically in packed supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) using pure carbon dioxide as the mobile phase. Numerical methods developed previously which enabled {{the prediction of}} pressure gradients, diffusitivities, capacity factors and plate heights {{along the length of}} the column were used for the model calculations. The effects of inlet pressure and supercritical fluid flow rate on selectivity and resolution are studied. In packed column SFC with pure carbon dioxide as the mobile phase, the pressure drop can have a significant effect on resolution. The calculated data are shown to be in good agreement with the experimental results. Flow rate is shown to have a larger effect than generally realized.

Different numerical methods of determining peak profile attributes (non¬linear peak fitting procedures by Edgeworth-Cramer series expansions, numerical integration, graphical determination) are compared. The approach is applied to a standard polystyrene sample, with ethylbenzene as polymer solvent and carrier liquid, as extensive physicochemical informations on this polymer-solvent system are available in the literature.

40|$|Introduction: In the {{inaccessible}} {{areas on}} the crown the removal of calculus and stains by hand and ultrasonic instrumentation is the method for cleaning to preserve and increase the longevity of the restoration. However, when oral prophylaxis is performed on restorative crowns, it may produce some surface alterations and may favour plaque accumulation. Statement of Problem: Many patients may have restored their teeth with artificial crowns and {{would come to the}} dental office for oral prophylaxis. If a routine oral prophylaxis is followed, its effect on the restorative materials and the plaque accumulation can be studied. Materials and Methods: A total of 15 disc shaped wax patterns were invested and casted for cast titanium (Group A) and the remaining 15 disk shaped for nickel-chromium (Group B). The obtained castings were finished and polished. All the specimens were subjected to hand and ultrasonic scaling for 15 s. Profilometer and scanning electron microscopic was used to analyze and evaluate the surface roughness. Specimens of each group were embedded on the anterior lingual aspects of the removable lower <b>retention</b> <b>plates.</b> 5 volunteers were asked to wear it in the mouth for 24 h for 7 days. After 7 days, the specimens were stained with plaque disclosing solutions and the photomicrographs were taken by the optical stereomicroscope and the plaque accumulations were assessed in percentage. Results: The difference in average surface roughness (μm) of the polished test specimens was maximum for ultrasonic scaling than hand scaling and maximum for Group A than Group B. Plaque accumulation in percentage on the treated specimens was found to be nonsignificant but, mean plaque accumulation was maximum on ultrasonic scaling surface than hand scaling and maximum for Group A than Group B. Surface roughness was found to be statistically significant after hand scaling (F = 9. 377, P = 0. 000) and ultrasonic scaling (F = 5. 373, P = 0. 0000) by Student t-test.

40|$|This {{assessment}} was {{initiated by the}} NASA Engineering & Safety Center (NESC) {{after a number of}} recent "high profile" connector problems, the most visible and publicized of these being the problem with the Space Shuttle's Engine Cut-Off System cryogenic feed-thru connector. The NESC commissioned a review of NASA's connector selection and application processes for space flight applications, including how lessons learned and past problem records are fed back into the processes to avoid recurring issues. Team members were primarily from the various NASA Centers and included connector and electrical parts specialists. The commissioned study was conducted on spacecraft connector selection and application processes at NASA Centers. The team also compared the NASA spacecraft connector selection and application process to the military process, identified recent high profile connector failures, and analyzed problem report data looking for trends and common occurrences. The team characterized NASA's connector problem experience into a list of top connector issues based on anecdotal evidence of a system's impact and commonality between Centers. These top issues are as follows, in no particular rank order: electrically shorted, bent and/or recessed contact pins, contact pin/socket contamination leading to electrically open or intermittencies, connector plating corrosion or corrosion of connector components, low or inadequate contact pin retention forces, contact crimp failures, unmated connectors and mis-wiring due to workmanship errors during installation or maintenance, loose connectors due to manufacturing defects such as wavy washer and worn bayonet retention, damaged connector elastomeric seals and cryogenic connector failure. A survey was also conducted of SAE Connector AE- 8 C 1 committee members regarding their experience relative to the NASA concerns on connectors. The most common responses in order of occurrence were contact <b>retention,</b> <b>plating</b> issues, worn-out or damaged coupling mechanisms, bent pins, contact crimp barrel cracking and torn seals. In addition to these common themes, responses included issues with markings, dimensional errors on the build, contact/socket damage (handling), manufacturing defects and customer misapplication and mishandling. The NESC team concluded that considering the large quantity and wide variety of connectors successfully flown on human and robotic space applications, the number of failures is quite low. However, "high profile" failures with significant cost, schedule, safety, and/or mission success impacts continue to occur. It was also concluded that connector failures occur throughout a system's life-cycle with the majority of connector issues application related. A number of recommendations were identified for improving NASA connector selection processes and overall space connector reliability and performance...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} use of high-performance affinity chromatography (HPAC) and monolithic columns to study drug-protein interactions. The first project studied the binding of imipramine to human serum albumin (HSA) by using HPAC. Frontal analysis and zonal elution competition studies determined that imipramine had one major binding site and a second group of weaker, non-specific binding regions on HSA. ^ The overall objective of {{the remainder of this}} dissertation was to develop microaffinity columns for use in HPAC and drug-protein binding studies. The second project used silica monoliths in affinity microcolumns for the high-throughput analysis of drug-protein interactions. It was found that HSA silica monoliths in affinity microcolumns as short as 1 to 3 mm could be used to provide reliable estimates of <b>retention</b> factor and <b>plate</b> height. A comparison between silica monoliths and silica particles in microcolumns showed that silica monoliths allowed for {{the use of}} faster flow rates because of their better mass transfer properties, which decreased analysis times. ^ The third project used silica particles in columns with lengths from 1 mm to 2 cm to compare affinity microcolumns to traditional longer affinity columns in HPAC. Zonal elution studies showed that <b>retention</b> factor, <b>plate</b> height, and peak asymmetry measurements were fairly consistent across all of the tested flow rates. However, there was a decrease in precision as shorter column lengths were used. Frontal analysis studies determined that association equilibrium constant measurements for all column lengths were consistent. In these studies, using affinity microcolumns for frontal analysis studies to decrease analysis times did not compromise the accuracy of these measurements. ^ The last project used the noncompetitive peak decay method with HSA silica monolith affinity microcolumns to measure the dissociation rate constants of several drugs from HSA. Work with flow rates as high as 10 mL/min made it possible to provide dissociation rate constants for warfarin in less than 40 s. This method was then extended to other drugs known to bind to HSA, including diazepam, imipramine, acetohexamide, and tolbutamide. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the use of affinity microcolumns as tools for the rapid analysis and highthroughput screening of drug-protein binding. The protein used was immobilized human serum albumin (HSA) and the model analytes were warfarin and L-tryptophan, two solutes often used as site-specific probes for drug binding to Sudlow sites I and II of HSA, respectively. The use of HSA microcolumns in binding studies was examined by using both zonal elution and frontal analysis formats. The zonal elution studies were conducted by injecting the probe compounds onto HSA microcolumns of varying lengths while measuring the resulting <b>retention</b> factors, <b>plate</b> heights and peak asymmetries. A decrease in the retention factor was noted when moving from longer to shorter column lengths while using a constant amount of injected solute. However, this change could be corrected, in part, by determining the relative retention factor of a solute versus a reference compound injected onto the same microcolumn. The plate height values were relatively consistent for all column lengths and gave an expected increase at higher linear velocities. The peak asymmetries were similar for all columns up to 1 mL/min but shifted to larger values at higher flow rates and when using short microcolumns (e. g., 1 mm length). The association equilibrium constants and number of binding sites estimated by frontal analysis for warfarin with HSA were consistent at the various columns sizes that were tested and gave good agreement with previous literature values. These results confirmed affinity microcolumns provide comparable results to those obtained with longer columns {{and can be used}} in the rapid analysis of drug-protein binding and in the high-throughput screening of such interactions...|$|R

This gain factor, remaining more or less constant over the most relevant range of plate numbers, largely paralleled the reduction of the mobile phase viscosity accompanying the temperature increase.

40|$|Introduction. Saliva {{viscosity}} plays {{a significant}} role in the biophysical segment of the total retention potential of total dentures. Objective. The aim of the paper was to establish the dependence of dynamic retention force of experimental plates on experimental fluid viscosity and especially time dependence of these parameters, following at the same time relative changes of the distance between the experimental plate and dentures support established by the dislocation of the experimental plate in both directions. Methods. For experimental verification we used an original device with the aim to enable in vivo simulation on the phantom made of the upper total denture prosthesis support and experimental plate. The experiment consisted of two parts. In the first part we determined the value of the dynamic <b>retention</b> force with <b>plates</b> without and with achieved ventilation effect. In the second part we determined time dependence of the dynamic retention force of experimental plates on the viscosity of experimental fluids that had been priorly determined on identical samples (8 ml of experimental fluid samples) using a rotational viscometer (Haake RV- 12) with a sensor (MV, Germany). Results Under the conditions of variable viscosity rates of seven experimental fluids (from 0. 02 to 1309. 04 mPa•s), we registered the time dependence of dynamic retention force of the experimental plate related to fluid viscosity during the action of the continual dislocating force of the separating directions. In addition, the maximal height of the dislocation of the experimental plate was registered. The dynamic retention force, manifested by the separating direction of the experimental plate dislocation, was increased concurrently with increased viscosity. Conclusion. The increase of dynamic retention force depends directly on medium viscosity. Close border values of fluid viscosity above the investigated ones, the impossibility of experimental layer thinning and the decrease of distance height probably influence the onset of separating dislocation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, silica {{monolithic}} capillaries have focused {{more and more}} attention on miniaturized sepn. techniques like capillary electrochromatog. (CEC), nano-liq. chromatog. (nano-LC) and chip electrochromatog. owing to their unique chromatog. properties and their simplified prepn. compared with packed columns. They were synthesized according to a sol-gel multi-step process that includes, after a gelation step at 40 ° giving the macropores network and the silica skeleton, a post-gelation step (hydrothermal treatment at 120 ° in basic medium) that allows to tailor the mesopores and finally a calcination or a washing step to remove remaining polymers. To reduce the synthesis time, the no. of synthesis steps and above all the temp. synthesis, to adapt the synthesis of such silica monoliths in polymeric microsystem devices, the authors extensively studied {{the influence of the}} hydrothermal treatment and its duration on textural (pore size distribution) and chromatog. properties (retention, efficiency) of in situ-synthesized capillary monoliths in nano-LC and CEC. This study was performed on pure silica and octyl chains grafted silica monoliths. Untreated monoliths show small pores (< 6 nm), whereas hydrothermally treated monoliths exhibit medium and large mesopores (8 - 17 nm). The hydrothermal treatment at 120 ° was not necessary for pure silica monolithic capillaries dedicated to normal phase liq. chromatog. or hydrophilic interaction liq. chromatog.

40|$|In {{analytical}} chromatography, {{the sample}} we analyze is usually rather dilute {{and allows the}} development of a rather straightforward method. Due to the minute concentrations we deal with in analytical chromatography, we face a linear behavior. The retention time of the analytes and the selectivity of a given separation can be forecast by simple rules that tremendously help us to develop efficient and fast separations. However, when we increase the sample size and a finite amount of sample is introduced in a chromatographic column, we leave the shelter of linear chromatography and have to cope with more complex peak shapes and phenomena. When the amount of the sample is comparable to the adsorption capacity of the zone of the column the migrating molecules occupy, the analyte molecules compete for adsorption {{on the surface of the}} stationary phase. The molecules disturb the adsorption of other molecules, and that phenomenon is normally taken into account by nonlinear adsorption isotherms. The nonlinear adsorption isotherm arises from the fact that the equilibrium concentrations of the solute molecules in the stationary and the mobile phases are not directly proportional. The stationary phase has a finite adsorption capacity; lateral interactions may arise between molecules in the adsorbed layer, and those lead to nonlinear isotherms. If we work in the concentration range where the isotherms are nonlinear, we arrive to the field of nonlinear chromatography where thermodynamics controls the peak shapes. The <b>retention</b> time, selectivity, <b>plate</b> number, peak width, and peak shape are no longer constant but depend on the sample size and several other factors. In addition to be a fundamental piece of information to modeling and optimizing preparative separations, adsorption isotherm determination is the key to study analytestationary phase interactions. Besides they allow for the characterization in terms of adsorption energy distribution of the surface heterogeneity. If biomolecules (peptides, proteins, etc.) or molecules with biological activity (such as drugs, etc.) were chemically bound to the stationary phase one speaks in terms of bioaffinity chromatography. In these cases, adsorption isotherm measurements are a powerful tool to study molecular recognition processes between the adsorbed biomolecules and any analyte injected into the chromatographic column. During this PhD thesis, different aspects of fundamentals of adsorption processes at the liquid-solid interface have been considered. In parallel, we focused on the setup of instrumental techniques for the automatic determination of adsorption isotherms. For that which concerns the study of fundamentals of adsorption, stationary phases traditionally employed in liquid chromatography (C 18) have been characterized by investigating the adsorption from binary mixtures of compounds with different chemico-physical properties. This kind of study was essentially realized by measuring excess isotherms. Through them, the preferential adsorption of one component with respect to the other constituting the mixture can be determined. These studies are important to understand the role of so-called organic modifiers in the chromatographic separation process. In fact, in reversed phase chromatography the organic modifier is usually considered as a mean to increase mobile phase analyte solubility, while its active role in the adsorption process is often underestimated. We then focused on bioaffiniy recognition studies by applying nonlinear concepts to the characterization of adsorption of peptides and dipetides on a macrocyclic antibiotic (Teicoplanin) chemically bounded to silica gel. It was demonstrated that nonlinear chromatography can be considered a valid alternative to other techniques in use for the determination of binding constants (such as ELISA, Surface Plasmon Resonance, etc.). The fundamental advantage of nonlinear studies is that they permit to distinguish between selective and non-selective interactions in the molecular recognition process, which is not achievable by other investigation techniques. Adsorption equilibria of insulin (a relatively small protein, about 5800 Da) in different experimental conditions were studied with the purpose of understanding the mechanisms responsible for the chromatographic behavior of this protein. In fact, insulin retention is characterized by a very large sensitivity to the mobile phase composition. Nonlinear adsorption data were coupled with circular dichroism and mass spectrometry measurements. Our purpose was to understand if tertiary structure modifications or agglomerate formation (dimers, trimers, etc.) could be at the origin of the observed phenomena. Besides thermodynamic aspects, kinetic phenomena are fundamental to characterize the chromatographic process. In chromatography, in particular, we refer to mass transfer kinetics, that is the ensemble of the processes involved in the transfer of solute molecules from the mobile to the stationary phase. In chromatography, these include axial dispersion (molecular and eddy diffusion), external and internal mass transfer (pore diffusion and surface diffusion), and adsorption-desorption kinetics. In this work, mass transfer phenomena on a new kind of monolithic columns, obtained through gamma-ray polymerization, were studied. The combined use of Van Deemter and kinetic plots allowed to correlate column efficiency to the length of cross-linkers used in polymerization. In addition to these fundamental studies, the other part of this work was about the set-up of instrumentation for different kinds of purposes. A pseudo-bidimensional system that allows for the deconvolution and online sampling of chromatographic peaks measured under nonlinear and gradient conditions was developed. The importance of this system is that it permits to achieve the information necessary for the determination of adsorption isotherms in an optimized and automatic manner by exploiting numerical procedures, known in literature as inverse methods. A second application was in the field of pharmaceutics. By using a system which combines size exclusion and polar reversed-phase columns, a method for the simultaneous purification and determination of iomeprol, a radiopharmaceutical analyte, in human plasma was developed and validated...|$|R
