25|$|Count 3: Modification {{of mobile}} <b>roaming</b> <b>agreement.</b> Previously, {{there were no}} roaming {{agreements}} between mobile operators – subscribers from one operator {{were not allowed to}} use services on another operator's network, thus limiting the growth of the mobile industry. Under the Thaksin government, roaming was allowed, with roaming fees deducted from the revenue that AIS and other operators had to share with TOT and other state enterprises. Essentially, TOT helped AIS shoulder the costs of its subscribers roaming on the mobile networks of other operators. This reduced TOT and CAT's income while benefiting the operators. However, the judges ruled that it while benefited AIS, it did so to the benefit of AIS's new owners (Temasek Holdings) rather than Thaksin, and hence was not an abuse of power.|$|E
25|$|Hutchison 3G {{launched}} in the UK on 3 March 2003 (03-03-03), the day that 3G services went live across the country, and handsets went on sale later that month. This made Three the UK's first commercial video mobile network. On 9 December 2004, Three {{announced that it was}} the first network to meet its regulatory requirement of 80% population coverage in the UK. Three's UK division is owned entirely by Hutchison Whampoa. Three operates 3G and 4G services, and maintains a national <b>roaming</b> <b>agreement</b> with Orange to provide 2G services where 3G is unavailable. Until 2006, Three partnered with O2 for 2G services. The 2G fallback coverage provided by Orange has since greatly diminished. While still available, it is being removed in some areas as Three believe 3G technology is now enough for mass adoption, and as a result, many (often at the cheaper end) phones that support only 2G networks are not compatible with the Three network.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, 3 was {{formerly}} known as Andala 3G SpA, a company founded in November 1999 and controlled by Sardinian internet company Tiscali and Franco Bernabè. It was the first mobile operator to offer 3G services (UMTS), launched in March 2003. As of March 2010, 3 Italia had 9 million registered customers. 3 Italy is the largest company in the 3-group measured in number of subscribers. It has a <b>roaming</b> <b>agreement</b> with TIM which allows its customers to get a 2G service when they move out of 3G coverage. This agreement allows 3 to offer coverage to up to 99.8% of the population on 2G service. On 22 February 2006, 3 announced the first launch of HSDPA technology in Italy, with initial coverage of Rome. The HSDPA service, which provides wireless broadband access with speed up to 14.4 Megabit/s, has been initially launched offering connection speeds up to 3.6 Megabit/s. The service has been called ADSM (as a contraction for ADSL Mobile). On 14 May 2006 3 was the 1st in Italy to launch the Digital Mobile TV with the DVB-H technology (70% of population); this service is currently available with three mobile models LG U900, LG U960 & Samsung SGH-P910. 3 Italy's slogan is: Meglio cambiare, no? (It's better to change, isn't it?). From November 2006 to March 2007, 3 Italy's testimonial has been Paris Hilton, followed by Luciana Littizzetto. From 6 June 2008, 3 Italy offers free of charge the viewing of Rai 1, Rai 2, Canale 5, Italia 1, Rete 4, SKY Meteo24, Current TV and La7 television channels with DVB-H technology.|$|E

2500|$|Three Austria started {{operations}} in May 2003. The company promised to have 95% population coverage with HSDPA end of 2007. By 2008, 3's 3G coverage reached 94% of the population. Outside {{the coverage of}} its own 3G-network (UMTS/HSDPA/HSPA+) it relies on national roaming on the network of T-Mobile Austria (before Mid-2012, the network of A1 was used for national roaming). 3 Austria {{is the first in}} Austria to offer its customers so called [...] "HD Mobile TV" [...] based on the H.264 encoding standard, and won IIR telcon awards for their eBay (2006) and X-Series Gold (2007) offerings. 3 Austria won a DVB-H license and launched the service in June 2008, with three devices and free usage of Mobile TV. In September 2010 – The number of 1 million customers were exceeded. In November 2011 – 3 Austria launched HD Voice and LTE In January 2012, 3 Austria announced its national <b>roaming</b> <b>agreement</b> with T-Mobile, which will introduce from July 2012. Customers of 3 Austria will be able to roam on T-Mobile's GSM-network where 3's GSM-network is not available. Simultaneous clients of T-Mobile (including tele.ring) will be able to roam on 3's UMTS-network where T-Mobile's UMTS-network is not available. The <b>roaming</b> <b>agreement</b> with A1 will be continued parallel until year-end. On 3 February 2012 Hutchison Whampoa announced that it had bought Orange Austria for US$1.7 billion, from France Télécom which owned a 35% stake, and private equity firm Mid Europa Partners, which held the remaining 65%. The combined business will create a mobile carrier with 2.8 million customers and more than 20 percent market share in Austria. JPMorgan Chase advised Hutchison on the deal, while Morgan Stanley advised France Télécom and Mid Europa Partners.|$|E
2500|$|... 3 has a licence for {{operation}} in Ireland using the access code 083 (although numbers can be ported over from other networks.) The service was launched on 26 July 2005 as Ireland's fourth mobile network operator behind Vodafone, O2 and Meteor. 3's coverage {{is made up}} of a single 2,100MHz band UMTS network, with claims of 96% population coverage and 500,000 subscribers. A <b>roaming</b> <b>agreement</b> with Vodafone provides GSM coverage where no UMTS signal is available. Service was initially offered as post-paid only, but on 16 May 2006 the introduction of a pre-paid service, known as 3Pay, was announced. A pre-paid mobile broadband service was launched on 29 February 2008 under the name 3Pay Broadband, with vouchers available for durations of one day, one week, or one month. On 13 May 2010, 3 Ireland announced the launch of the world's first commercial voice and data I-HSPA network. In July 2012, 3 Ireland announced a strategic partnership with Vodafone Ireland to share network infrastructure. This facilitated rapid rollout of 3 Ireland's 4G network, while also making it less costly. When a 3 user is using 2G or Edge connection, they are using Vodafone's 2G network, as 3 are a 3G/HSDPA network only. In November 2012 it was awarded LTE spectrum by auction, along with the three other incumbent network operators. On 24 June 2013, it was announced that Hutchison would acquire Telefónica's Irish mobile operations, O2 for €780 million, to be merged into 3 Ireland upon completion of the deal. As of 2014, The European Commission has agreed to the go ahead of the merge. On 27 January 2014, Three launched their 4G network in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Wexford and Waterford.
