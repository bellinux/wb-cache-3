5|$|During their {{modernization}} {{under the}} 600-ship Navy program, the Iowa-class battleships' <b>radar</b> systems were again upgraded. The AN/SPS-6 air-search <b>radar</b> system {{was replaced with}} the AN/SPS-49 <b>radar</b> set (which also augmented the existing navigation capabilities on the battleships), and the AN/SPS-8 surface-search <b>radar</b> set {{was replaced by the}} AN/SPS-67 search <b>radar.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like the US AH-64D Apache Longbow, the Apache AH1 {{carries a}} fire-control <b>radar</b> (FCR) and <b>Radar</b> Frequency Interferometer (RFI), {{providing}} an integrated surveillance and attack system. The 'Longbow’ <b>radar</b> is the bulbous unit over the rotor hub assembly; <b>radar</b> placement above the rotors allows the Apache to hover behind cover scanning for targets, {{with only the}} <b>radar</b> unit exposed. Additionally, the Longbow <b>radar</b> can monitor traffic in the Apache's airspace. The <b>radar</b> {{can also be used}} for surveillance and terrain profiling. A modem is interfaced into the Longbow <b>radar</b> and other sensor systems to relay information to other aircraft, this allows other Apaches to fire on targets identified by only a single helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The South Dakotas {{were able}} to reap the {{benefits}} of developments in <b>radar</b> technology during World War 2. By the end of the war, the ships were equipped with air and surface-search radars and <b>radar</b> fire-control. When commissioned, the ships were equipped with the SC air-search <b>radar.</b> This <b>radar</b> would eventually get replaced by the SK and SK-2 air-search <b>radar.</b> The main battery directors were fitted with Mark 3 fire-control <b>radar,</b> which were replaced by the Mark 8 starting in 1942. This <b>radar</b> gave these ships a significant advantage over the Japanese, which for the most part relied on optical systems.|$|E
50|$|Several search <b>radars</b> are {{discovered}} {{to be associated}} with HQ-9, including anti-ballistic <b>radars</b> and anti-stealth <b>radars.</b>|$|R
50|$|SRCTec {{provides}} {{manufacturing and}} lifecycle support for electronics systems, including counter-fire <b>radars,</b> air-surveillance <b>radars,</b> counter-IED and ground surveillance <b>radars.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Dnestr/Dnepr <b>radars</b> were {{intended}} {{to be replaced by}} the newer Daryal <b>radars</b> starting in the 1990s. Only two of the planned Daryal <b>radars</b> became operational, due to issues such as the dissolution of the Soviet Union. As of 2012, the Russian early warning network still consists of some <b>radars</b> of this vintage. It is likely that all the existing <b>radars</b> will be replaced by the third generation Voronezh <b>radars</b> by 2020.|$|R
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{equipped}} with one LW-05 air-search <b>radar,</b> one ZW-06 surface-search <b>radar,</b> one LW-10 tactical <b>radar</b> and one Type 963 aircraft landing <b>radar</b> with other communication systems.|$|E
5|$|A mid-wing, all-metal, {{cantilever}} monoplane {{with two}} Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp radial engines mounted in streamlined nacelles under the wing, the XTSF-1 {{was intended to}} carry two crew members in tandem seats, and featured an internal bomb bay and a SCR-720 <b>radar</b> set, the <b>radar</b> later being replaced in the design by an AN/APS-3 or AN/APS-4 set. A second seat was added for the <b>radar</b> operator.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of war, both ships were fitted with a degaussing coil to protect them against magnetic mines. Leipzig had her aircraft equipment removed in 1941, along with her after torpedo tubes. In 1942, Nürnbergs aircraft handling equipment and aft torpedo tubes were also removed. Throughout the war, the ships' <b>radar</b> suites were upgraded; in March 1941, Nürnberg was equipped with FuMO 21 <b>radar</b> and in early 1942, a FuMO 25 <b>radar</b> set was installed. The latter was a search <b>radar</b> for surface targets and low-flying aircraft at low range. The FuMO 21 set {{was replaced by the}} short-range FuMO 63 Hohentwiel 50-centimeter <b>radar.</b> Nürnberg was also fitted with four Metox <b>radar</b> warning receivers. Leipzig did not receive her FuMO 24/25 <b>radar</b> set until 1943; this was to be the last modification for Leipzig.|$|E
5|$|An August 1944 study {{anticipated}} that the ships would carry four early warning <b>radars,</b> including height-finders, four surface search <b>radars</b> and eight gunnery/fire-control <b>radars.</b> Historian David Hobbs wrote that they would mount Type 960 early warning, Type 982 intercept, Type 983 height-finding and Type 293M target indication <b>radars.</b> In addition a number of gunnery <b>radars</b> would also be needed.|$|R
50|$|One system {{configuration}} - external command post, CP of the S-300V and every <b>radars</b> of S-300V {{and the outside}} <b>radars,</b> other external elements. This is the central core, for it served a few battalions of S-300V system. All battalions at full strength of S-300V system (CP of the S-300V and every <b>radars</b> of the S-300V, and a few launchers with <b>radars,</b> and a few launchers without <b>radars).</b>|$|R

5|$|Another British {{scientist}} {{working on}} <b>radar</b> systems and techniques was R. V. Jones, {{who had been}} appointed in 1939 as Britain's first Scientific Intelligence Officer and had spent {{the first years of}} the conflict researching how advanced German <b>radar</b> was in comparison to Britain, and convincing doubters that the Germans actually had <b>radar.</b>|$|E
5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of energy from the <b>radar</b> hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the <b>radar.</b> The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the <b>radar,</b> and the echo is further away from the <b>radar</b> than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E
50|$|Other {{types of}} <b>radars</b> have been flown for earth {{observation}} missions: precipitation <b>radars</b> {{such as the}} Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission, or cloud <b>radars</b> like the one used on Cloudsat.|$|R
30|$|The vast {{majority}} of traditional <b>radars</b> use harmonic pulse signals to detect targets. The bandwidth of signals used in such <b>radars</b> is {{much less than the}} carrier frequency. Consequently, these <b>radars</b> can provide only low resolution detection. However, in today’s applications, high-resolution <b>radars</b> are sought for fine and sensitive surveillance of the environment.|$|R

5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release information collected from military <b>radar</b> because of sensitivity about revealing their capabilities. Indonesia has an early-warning <b>radar</b> system, but its air traffic control <b>radar</b> did not register any aircraft with the transponder code used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, or over, {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. Indonesian military <b>radar</b> tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to waypoint IGARI before the transponder is thought to have been turned off, but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on <b>radar</b> before the transponder stopped working. The <b>radar</b> position symbols for the transponder code used by Flight 370 vanished after the transponder is thought to have been turned off. Thai military <b>radar</b> detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last <b>radar</b> contact was made. The signal did not include identifying data. The flight was also not detected by Australia's conventional or its long-range JORN over-the-horizon <b>radar</b> system, which has an official range of 3,000km, the latter not being in operation {{on the night of the}} disappearance.|$|E
5|$|Details of the Implacable-class ships' <b>radar</b> suite are {{not readily}} available. They were fitted with the Type 277 surface-search/height-finding <b>radar</b> {{on top of}} the bridge and a Type 293 target {{indicator}} <b>radar</b> on the foremast. , one of the Illustrious-class ships upon which Indefatigables design was based, also carried Type 279 and Type 281B early-warning radars. Type 282 and Type 285 gunnery radars were mounted on the fire-control directors.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} {{mounted on}} each of the E-3's four engines provide the one megawatt of electrical power that is required by the E-3's radars and other electronics. Its pulse-Doppler <b>radar</b> (PD) has a range of more than 250mi (400km) for low-flying targets at its operating altitude, and the pulse (BTH) <b>radar</b> has a range of approximately 400mi (650km) for aircraft flying at medium to high altitudes. The <b>radar,</b> combined with an SSR, and electronic support measures (ESM), provides a look down capability, to detect, identify, and track low-flying aircraft, while eliminating ground clutter (<b>radar)</b> returns.|$|E
5|$|When {{war broke}} out in 1941, Voroshilov was not {{equipped}} with any <b>radars,</b> but she received a number of British Lend-Lease <b>radars</b> by 1944. One Type 284 and two Type 285 <b>radars</b> were used for main battery fire control. One Type 291 was used for air search, while anti-aircraft fire control was provided by two Type 282 <b>radars.</b>|$|R

5|$|Interferometric {{synthetic}} aperture <b>radar</b> (InSAR) is a <b>radar</b> technique used in geodesy and remote sensing. Satellite {{synthetic aperture}} <b>radar</b> {{images of a}} geographic feature are taken on separate days, and changes {{that have taken place}} between <b>radar</b> images taken on the separate days are recorded as fringes similar to those obtained in holographic interferometry. The technique can monitor centimeter- to millimeter-scale deformation resulting from earthquakes, volcanoes and landslides, and also has uses in structural engineering, in particular for the monitoring of subsidence and structural stability. Fig20 shows Kilauea, an active volcano in Hawaii. Data acquired using the space shuttle Endeavour's X-band Synthetic Aperture <b>Radar</b> on April 13, 1994 and October 4, 1994 were used to generate interferometric fringes, which were overlaid on the X-SAR image of Kilauea.|$|E

5|$|Like its sibling V-Bombers, the Victor {{made use}} of the Navigational and Bombing System (NBS); a little-used optical sight had also been {{installed}} upon early aircraft. For navigation and bomb-aiming purposes, the Victor employed numerous <b>radar</b> systems. These included the H2S <b>radar,</b> the first airborne ground-scanning <b>radar,</b> and the Green Satin <b>radar.</b> <b>Radar</b> information was inputted into the onboard electromechanical analogue bomb-aiming apparatus. Some of the navigation and targeting equipment was either directly descended from, or shared concepts with, those used on Handley Page's preceding Halifax bomber. Operationally, {{the accuracy of the}} bomb-aiming system proved to be limited to roughly 400 yards, which was deemed sufficient for high-level nuclear strike operations.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Major Margaret Houlihan (Loretta Swit) and Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville) are eagerly {{awaiting}} the upcoming transfer of {{command of the}} 4077th MASH: upon Blake's departure, Burns will become the unit commander. Henry and <b>Radar</b> begin {{to clean out the}} main office, sharing a sentimental moment in which <b>Radar</b> tells Blake of his meaning to him. As a token of appreciation and admiration, <b>Radar</b> gives him an inscribed Winchester cartridge; a surprised Henry returns the favor by spontaneously giving <b>Radar</b> a rectal thermometer that once belonged to his father.|$|E
5|$|Molotov was {{the first}} Soviet ship to carry <b>radar,</b> a Redut-K air warning system, which she used for the entire war. Soviet-designed Mars-1 gunnery <b>radar</b> systems were added by 1944.|$|E
