Following these studies for gum tragacanth and C. M. C., now the similar studis for locust bean mucilage (gum), also known as carob bean gum were carried out using Stormer type <b>rotational</b> <b>viscosimeter.</b> Furthermore, instead of the previous measurements on the viscosity of ca. 3 % aqueous solution with the viscosimeter of the falling ball type, the present measurements on that of ca. 1. 5 % aqueous gum tragacanth solution with <b>rotational</b> <b>viscosimeter</b> are also canied out. The results obtained may be summarized in the following: (I) Effects of 5 sorts of polyphosphates such as sodium pyrophosphate, sodium tripoly phosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate and their mixtures on the about 1. 0 [...] 1. 5 % aqueous solution of locust bean gum as one of plant mucilage and on the about 3 % aqueous solution of gum tragacanth as one of plant gum are studied and the considerable increase of their viscosity are observed. (II) In both cases, each curve relating the viscosity-quantities added has maximum and the orders for the increassing effect with these polyphosphates resembled each other. (III) It appears that this increasing of the viscosity will be partly ascribed to the increased formation of aggregation of the linear negative ions and may be partly based on the untwisting of somewhat kinked linear macromolecule having many hydroxyl groups probably caused by the adsorption of these polyphosphate ions kindred with that group. 浅岡が従来行って来ている重合燐酸塩の利用に関連した多くの研究のうちで発表済のものは若千に過ぎない。しかしその中に高分子物質水溶液の粘度に対する添加物の影響の研究としてトラガントゴム水溶液についての報告があるので，ゴム類ではないが或意味ではこれと類似とも云える植物粘質物であるローカストゴムについて同様の実験を行ったものである。このローカストゴムは食品，化粧品，繊維加工，製紙，医薬用ゼリーなどの方面の用途が知られているので，これに対する添加物効果はその利用面からも主要である。更に既報ではトラガントゴム水溶液の粘度測定が落球式であったので，今回はローカストゴム水溶液と同じく回転粘度計によって測定可能の粘度まで低下させるために，前の約半分の濃度である約 3 %にして同種の実験を行ったものである...|$|E

Imbalance between tissue deposition stimulated by growth factors and tissue destruction mediated by proteases causes nonhealing of chronic wounds [1]. To overcome the destroyable effect of proteases, the application of growth factors or protease 2 ̆ 7 s inhibitors has been shown as successful. The aim of our research work is to formulate and charaterize the biocompatible modern wound dressings with model protein for proteasećs inhibitor, which would enable protein stability, delivery and controlled release.

40|$|Summary. Hyperviscosity, due to {{alterations}} {{of blood}} cells and plasma components, can induce microvascular damage. Nitric oxide (NO) is released by endothelium and plays {{a crucial role}} in flow-mediated vasodilation. an impaired availability of NO, due to polymorphisms of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), may influence erythrocyte deformability thus increasing blood viscosity. We investigated haemorheological variables in patients with idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL), retinal vein occlusion (rVO) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), as possible models of micro-vascular damage, and their relationship with eNOS gene t- 786 c, G 894 t and 4 a/ 4 b polymorphisms. Whole blood viscosity and plasma viscosity were assessed with a <b>rotational</b> <b>viscosimeter</b> and eryth-rocyte deformability index (DI) with Myrenne filtrometer. eNOS polymorphisms were analyzed in ISSHL and SSc patients. at multivariate analysis alterations of some haemorheological variables resulted significantly associated with ISSHL, rVO and SSc. a significantly higher prevalence of eNOS- 786 c and 894 t was found in both ISSHL and SSc patients than in controls; at multivariate analysis these two polymorphisms significantly affected DI in both groups of patients. these results suggest that hyperviscosity, either determined by genetic susceptibility or not, can be involved in the pathophysiology of these clinical disorders and can be the target of new therapeutic strategies...|$|E

The most important functional properties of whey proteins are solubility, viscosity, water holding capacity, emulsification and foaming. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine functional properties of main whey protein fractions (α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin) which have the biggest influence on the functional properties of whey proteins. Particle size analysis and specific area of α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin were performed by «Mie – theory» of «light scatering» using «Malvern Mastersizer X».

40|$|Silica melts are {{reflected}} in many different industrial and natural processes such as slags in steel production and gasification of coal, glass in the glass making industry, lava in the volcanology and in lots of other fields. Rheological properties like the viscosity of this silica melts are really important {{in all of these}} processes. A general and good working viscosity model would help all scientists and engineers, who have to simulate and optimise these processes. First, {{it is important to have}} the possibility to measure viscosities of slags. As part of this PhD thesis a new high-temperature high-pressure <b>rotational</b> <b>viscosimeter</b> is developed for measurements up to 1600 °C and 20 bar. Particularly in relation to the coal gasification process this two parameters are really important, because coal gasification occurs under high temperatures and high pressures. With this new viscosimeter it is possible to measure slag viscosities under realistic gasification conditions. To show that the new viscosimeter works quite good viscosity measurements of four real slags have been done. The influence of pressure and atmosphere on viscosity have been examined. The measurements are also compared with different viscosity models. The Arrhenius- and Weymann-Equation have been determined and the correlation between viscosity and basicity of the slag has been evaluated. In the second part of the Phd thesis a new viscosity model is developed. The model is based on the structure inside the slag and consists in existing thermodynamic models. After a detailed literature research the model is developed for the SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -Na 2 O-K 2 O system. The quality of this new model is estimated by comparing calculated viscosity values with measurements found during the literature research. The new model is also compared with other existing models for viscosity calculation...|$|E

40|$|The {{past decade}} has {{witnessed}} the development and success of coarse-grained network models of proteins for predicting many equilibrium properties related to collective modes of motion. Curiously, the results are usually robust towards the different methodologies used for constructing residue networks from knowledge of the experimental coordinates. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we present a systematical study of network construction strategies, and we study their effect on the predicted properties using Anisotropic Network Model (ANM). The analysis is based on the radial distribution function and the spectral dimensions of a large set of proteins as well as a newly defined quantity, the angular distribution function. In the second part of the study, we apply ANM to the well-relaxed atomistic coordinates of a 32 - chain C 128 cis- 1, 4 -polybutadiene system to test the extent of applicability of the method. 15 - 60 ns long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are carried out for a wide variety of temperatures and pressures. The mean-square fluctuations of the central carbon atoms obtained by applying ANM on a few snapshots are shown to be in good agreement with values from full MD simulations. This leads to predict average flexibility values of the system under different conditions. We extend the methodology to approximate the virial of the system. In the third part, to understand the nanoclusters' behavior and influence on the polymer's viscoelastic and thermodynamic properties, different nanoclusters having 10 to 150 atoms are embedded in the cis- 1, 4 -polybutadiene matrix. First, the diffusion coefficient and zero shear viscosity are calculated from the simulations and compared with the experimental results obtained with <b>rotational</b> <b>viscosimeter.</b> In addition, correlation times of C-H bond vectors of simulation at four different temperatures were compared with the C-NMR experiments of cis- 1, 4 -polybutadiene with high-cis-content polybutadiene (% 93 cis, % 3 trans and % 4 vinyl). The agreement between simulation results and experiments confirm that the united atom force field used in the simulations well-describes the dynamics of the real system. It is also possible to manipulate mechanical properties by tuning the interaction strength of the nanoclusters with the chains. From a practical point of view, we can assume that bulk modulus is not much affected by the size of the nanocluster, whereas it linearly increases as the interaction strength changes from normal to strong. Another thermodynamical quantity, glass transition temperature (Tg) increases from ~ 176 K to ~ 184 K as the nanoclusters are introduced to the polymer melt. Tg decreases to ~ 178 K as their interaction strength is made much stronger than the standard value...|$|E
40|$|Two {{analytical}} {{models are}} proposed to describe two different mechanisms of lava tubes formation. A first model is introduced {{to describe the}} development of a solid crust in the central region of the channel, and the formation of a tube when crust widens until it reaches the leveés. The Newtonian assumption is considered and the steady state Navier- Stokes equation in a rectangular conduit is solved. A constant heat flux density assigned at the upper flow surface resumes the combined effects of two thermal processes: radiation and convection into the atmosphere. Advective terms are also included, by the introduction of velocity into the expression of temperature. Velocity is calculated as an average value over the channel width, so that lateral variations of temperature are neglected. As long as the upper flow surface cools, a solid layer develops, described as a plastic body, having a resistance to shear deformation. If the applied shear stress exceeds this resistance, crust breaks, otherwise, solid fragments present at the flow surface can weld together forming a continuous roof, as it happens in the sidewall flow regions. Variations of channel width, ground slope and effusion rate are analyzed, as parameters that strongly affect the shear stress values. Crust growing is favored when the channel widens, and tube formation is possible when the ground slope or the effusion rate reduce. A comparison of results is successfully made with data obtained from the analysis of pictures of actual flows. The second model describes the formation of a stable, well defined crust along both channel sides, their growing towards the center and their welding to form the tube roof. The fluid motion is described as in the model above. Thermal budget takes into account conduction into the atmosphere, and advection is included considering the velocity depending both on depth and channel width. The solidified crust has a non uniform thickness along the channel width. Stresses acting on the crust are calculated using the equations of the elastic thin plate, pinned at its ends. The model allows to calculate the distance where crust thickness is able to resist the drag of the underlying fluid and to sustain its weight by itself, and the level of the fluid can lower below the tube roof. Viscosity and thermal conductivity have been experimentally investigated {{through the use of a}} <b>rotational</b> <b>viscosimeter.</b> Analyzing samples coming from Mount Etna (2002) the following results have been obtained: the fluid is Newtonian and the thermal conductivity is constant in a range of temperature above the liquidus. For lower temperature, the fluid becomes non homogeneous, and the used experimental techniques are not able to detect any properties, because measurements are not reproducible. ...|$|E
40|$|Obliteration (gobbing) {{caused by}} water based {{lubricating}} fluids is studied experimentally {{by analyzing the}} flow through a small channel. Flow measurements, energy dispersive X-ray microscopy and photos show, {{that the rate of}} gobbing depends on which type of fluid that is being used. The explanation of the obliteration is chemical reactions between the fluids and surrounding material or dust in the fluids. In order to get {{a better understanding of the}} rheology of emulsions, the migration of visible spheres, with varying density, flowing downstreams through a vertical, rectangular channel, is studied. The results from the experiments show, that the equilibrium position of a sphere is a function of the density difference between the sphere and surrounding fluid. A density difference of 0. 5 per mille is enough to give stable positions. A theory is presented, which gives good agreement with the experimental results. Experiments have also been carried out in order to measure the effective viscosity of emulsions, flowing through a small horizontal channel. The viscosity is lower than the value obtained in a <b>rotational</b> <b>viscosimeter.</b> A theoretical explanation is proposed. An interesting example of two-phase flow is studied by means of a new prototype of a nozzle which lubricates a water jet with air. With this experimental nozzle, the dynamic pressure of the water jet increases 37 per cent. The explanation of this improvement is that some of the air forms a layer between the tube wall and the water, thus reducing friction between wall and water, giving a higher velocity of the water jet. With the results from the experimental nozzle in mind, five different full scale water cannon nozzles are designed, each with a certain method of air injection. The casting length, water flow and power consumption are measured and compared to a conventional nozzle. The performance is strongly dependent on the rate of water flow. For water flows of order 7 dm 3 /s, an increase in casting length of 12 per cent was achieved compared to a conventional nozzle. To achieve the same casting length, a conventional nozzle needs 39 per cent more power. Unfortunately the water flow with the new nozzle decreased with up to 48 per cent. For water flows of order 3 dm 3 /s, an increase in casting length of 93 per cent was achieved. To achieve the same casting length, a conventional nozzle needs 90 per cent more power. The water flow with the new nozzle decreased with 36 per cent. The final paper is an investigation of the lubrication between a plate and a rotating ball in normal approach. The normal velocity was varied between 0. 1 and 0. 5 m/s and the sliding velocity between 0 and 9. 2 m/s. The experiments show, that the viscosity is the most important lubricant parameter. The normal velocity, the pressure viscosity coefficient, and the shear strength proportionality constant do not affect the degree of lubrication. An increase of the sliding velocity gave a decrease of the degree of lubrication between 25 and 65 per cent depending on surface roughness and type of lubricant. The surface roughness is also of great importance in getting good lubrication. To avoid wear, one has to increase the viscosity from 8 to 145 mm 2 /S if the mean surface roughness, Ra, is increased from 0. 01 to 0. 14. Godkänd; 1987; 20070502 (ysko...|$|E
