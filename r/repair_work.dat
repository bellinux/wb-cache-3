5|$|<b>Repair</b> <b>work</b> {{commenced}} on {{the garden}} and undercroft in early 2008—the beams and columns supporting the terrace having become dangerously weak—and was scheduled to take three years to complete. The council commissioned NPS Architectural Group to oversee restoration {{and work on the}} memorial itself started in September 2009; the council initially hoped that the project would be complete by Armistice Day 2010. During the <b>repair</b> <b>work</b> the memorial itself was rotated to face the city hall, in accordance with the wishes of local veterans to allow them easier access for parades, and underwent minor restoration work. Its place in the memorial garden was taken by a new bronze sculpture: Breath by Paul de Monchaux. The garden re-opened to the public in March 2011. The memorial and garden was re-dedicated after three years on Armistice Day, 11 November 2011; the <b>repair</b> <b>work</b> had cost £2.6million.|$|E

5|$|The statue has {{required}} <b>repair</b> <b>work</b> {{on several occasions}} to fix damage and defects. Only {{a few months after}} it was installed, it was reported to be oscillating in strong gusts of wind. Marochetti pronounced it sound but promised to strengthen the legs if necessary. During the winter of 1908–09, frost damaged one of the forelegs of the horse part of the statue. It was found that between 60–80 leaks were letting water into the interior of the statue and causing further damage when it froze. It was also discovered that the statue had never been properly attached to the pedestal but was merely resting under its own weight on the two ends of its base. <b>Repair</b> <b>work</b> took place to remedy these problems.|$|E
