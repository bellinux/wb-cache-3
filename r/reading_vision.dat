40|$|BACKGROUND: Because of {{the growing}} life {{expectancy}} in developed countries and the exponential increase in vision loss with increasing age, {{a growing number of}} elderly persons will eventually suffer from visual impairment and blindness. This paper describes the association between self-reported vision and well-being in individuals aged 50 years and older and their families. METHODS: Using binary logistic regressions on data from the 2004 Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE), we analysed the association between self-reported corrected vision in general, corrected distance vision and corrected <b>reading</b> <b>vision</b> on 11 variables capturing emotional well-being, future hopes and perspectives, and concentration on daily activities. RESULTS: For 22, 486 individuals from 10 European countries, aged 64. 23 +/- 10. 52 years, lower vision was associated with a highly significant negative impact on all measured aspects of well-being. CONCLUSIONS: These data from a large population base in Europe provide evidence that persons with low vision have a higher probability of concentration problems during reading and entertainment; losing interest and enjoyment in their activities; feeling fatigued, irritable, sad, and tearful; having less hope for the future; and wishing for death. Effective measures of early detection, prevention, rehabilitation, education and research, as well as a holistic view of a patient, could help counter these problems, thereby improving mental and physical health and reducing the economic impact of low vision...|$|E
40|$|Objectiv To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} subthreshold micropulse yellow (577 nm) laser photocoagulation in diffuse macular edema (DME) in rural and urban patients of south-eastern Poland. Material and Methods Seventy-five eyes of 75 patients with diffuse DME were treated with subthreshold micropulse yellow laser photocoagulation with a 5 % duty cycle at an energy level. The laser exposure time was 20 ms and the spot diameter was 100 μm. Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), <b>reading</b> <b>vision</b> (Snellen) and optical coherence tomography-determined central retinal thickness (CRT) were estimated before and 2, 4 and 6 months after laser treatment. There were no statistically important differences in: the advancement of DME, HbA 1 c (glycated hemoglobin) level, duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), the degree of vision damage between rural and urban patients. Results The follow-up was 6 months later. The baseline BCVA was 0. 20 and remained stable- 0. 3 after 6 months. The Snellen at baseline was 1. 0 and improved to 0. 5 finally (p= 0. 0004). The CRT at baseline was 500 μm and changed to 346 μm (p= 0. 00000) at the final follow-up. Finally, no retinal damage was observed.

40|$|PURPOSE: Eduard Jaeger's {{original}} Test-Types {{were carefully}} evaluated: (1) {{to determine whether}} Jaeger had maintained a consistent standard, (2) to establish the correct Snellen equivalent for Jaeger's Test-Types, (3) {{to answer the question}} of why and how the standard was lost, and (4) to compare the visual angle of optotypes to lines of continuous text. METHODS: All original Viennese editions of Jaeger's Test-Types, as well as first generation United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US) versions, were evaluated. Data were collected objectively using a microruler with a 20 X loupe and subjectively using a laser distance-measuring device. The data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. All previous measurements of Jaeger's Test-Types, objective and subjective, collected over the past 133 years were compared to the current data and to each other. RESULTS: The correct Snellen equivalent of Jaeger's Test-Types was determined. The visual angle created from the measurement of the height of lowercase letters, without ascenders or descenders, provides an accurate method of assigning a visual angle of a line of continuous text. Comparing the typefaces used in printing first generation UK and US versions of Jaeger's Test-Types to the Viennese editions provided an explanation for the absence of a consistent standard for Jaeger's Test-Types today. CONCLUSIONS: All 10 versions of Jaeger's original Test-Types are virtually identical and established a gold standard for <b>reading</b> <b>vision</b> tests. Jaeger's standard was lost when his Test-Types were first printed in the UK and the US using local typefaces. The Jaeger standard has been re-established.

A total number of one hundred patients were selected and interviewed by the author for correspondence and two assistants. With the aid of semi-structured questionnaires, the information sought after collecting bio-data, included respondents ’ duration of spectacle correction and how often they wore their pair of spectacles. Those who wore their pair of spectacles at all times for the intended purpose for which the glass was prescribed such as distance vision, near (<b>reading)</b> <b>vision,</b> or both, were regarded as using it “always”. Those who wore theirs {{to a lesser degree}} but for more than 50 % of times were regarded as using it “often”. The “occasional ” wearers were those who used it for less than 50 % of the times. Each respondent was also asked to identify the possible factors associated with non-compliance with spectacle wear. Majority (71 %) used their spectacle occasionally while the remaining few (29 %) used it often. The reasons cited for not complying with spectacle correction were lack of felt need (58 %), spectacle intolerance (28 %) and ignorance (14 %). Majority of respondents wore their glasses only occasionally. The reasons for not complying fully with spectacle correction were lack of felt need which might have cultural underpinnings, spectacle intolerance, and ignorance of the attendant dangers of not seeing clearly while not wearing their pairs of glasses. Appropriate health education and improvement in optical infrastructures will assist in remedying the poor compliance culture with the wearing of glasses in Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|In {{the period}} of 1982 - 1984, a cross sectional, {{prevalence}} study of eye disease in the elderly population of Melton Mowbray was carried out. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine the prevalence of the three major blinding conditions in the elderly, namely senile cataract, chronic open-angle glaucoma and age related macular degeneration. The study population was a random sample of the surviving cohort of the Household Survey, which had previously been carried out by the Department of Community Health. Participants were asked to attend a special eye clinic in Melton Mowbray, where each was examined by an Ophthalmologist and an Ophthalmic Optician. The examination included measurement of visual acuity, refraction slit-lamp examination and fundus examination and photography after mydriasis. 529 persons from a study population of 677, participated in the study a response rate of 78 %. The prevalence of senile cataract was 55. 9 %, chronic open angle glaucoma 4. 5 % and age-related macular degeneration 42 %. Only 1. 1 % of the study participants had diabetic retinopathy. Significant associations for senile cataract were increasing age (p 0. 05) and the female sex (p 0. 001); for open angle-glaucoma, family history (p 0. 001) and the absence of arcus senilis (p 0. 05) and for macular degeneration, increasing age (p 0. 02) and the absence of arcus senilis (p 0. 001).

40|$|From 7 % to 10 % of all retinoblastomas {{and from}} 44 % to 71 % of {{familial}} retinoblastomas {{in developed countries}} are diagnosed in the neonatal period, usually through pre- or post-natal screening prompted by a positive family history and sometimes serendipitously during screening for retinopathy of prematurity or other reasons. In developing countries, neonatal diagnosis of retinoblastoma has been less common. Neonatal retinoblastoma generally develops from a germline mutation of RB 1, the retinoblastoma gene, even when the family history is negative and is thus usually hereditary. At least one-half of infants with neonatal retinoblastoma have unilateral tumors when the diagnosis is made, typically the International Intraocular Retinoblastoma Classification (Murphree) Group B or higher, but most germline mutation carriers will progress to bilateral involvement, typically Group A in the fellow eye. Neonatal leukokoria usually leads to the diagnosis in children without {{a family history of}} retinoblastoma, and a Group C tumor or higher is typical in the more advanced involved eye. Almost all infants with neonatal retinoblastoma have at least one eye with a tumor in proximity to the foveola, but the macula of the fellow eye is frequently spared. Consequently, loss of <b>reading</b> <b>vision</b> from both eyes is exceptional. A primary ectopic intracranial neuroblastic tumor known as trilateral retinoblastoma is no more common after neonatal than other retinoblastoma. For many reasons, neonatal retinoblastoma may be a challenge to eradicate, and the early age at diagnosis and relatively small tumors do not guarantee the preservation of both eyes of every involved child. Oncology nurses can be instrumental in contributing to better outcomes by ensuring that hereditary retinoblastoma survivors receive genetic counseling, by referring families of survivors to early screening programs when they are planning for a baby, and by providing psychological and practical support for parents when neonatal retinoblastoma has been diagnosed...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Laser vision {{correction}} (LVC) {{developed as}} a more permanent alternative {{to other forms of}} refractive error correction. In the last several decades, visual outcomes of corneal refractive surgeries like LVC have improved dramatically with the discovery of new technologies and techniques designed to make the patient experience more comfortable and worthwhile. LVC has been shown to safely and effectively treat refractive errors in myopic and hyperopic eyes, with gradually improving outcomes and safety measures. However, {{it is important to note}} whether specific excimer lasers impart the same level of safe, effective treatments for patients as technology advances. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify whether any statistically significant difference exists in the visual and refractive outcomes of hyperopic laser vision correction using two excimer laser platforms, the VISX STAR S 4 IR® and the WaveLight® EX 500, and to determine whether either laser shows any statistically significant difference in the rate of repeat surgery within one year post-operatively. METHODS: Using EMR data collected from December 2008 through December 2016, distance and near visual acuity outcomes for hyperopic eyes treated with LASIK, LASEK, or PRK were compared at one month and up to one year post-operatively. Distance eyes were compared separately from monovision (near-targeted) eyes for visual acuity; however, if manifest refraction post-operative data were available, they were used to identify whether any difference existed in the refractive outcomes in either category. The number of enhancements (repeat surgeries) was also tabulated. X 2 Tests of Independence were used to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: Visual acuity outcomes in distance eyes at one month post-operatively showed similar trends between the two lasers, with 54 % of the 267 VISX- and 60 % of the 119 EX 500 -treated eyes presenting with UCVA of 20 / 20 or better. Eyes available for follow-up within one year post-operatively kept with this trend; 98 (51 %) VISX- and 58 (67 %) EX 500 -treated, eyes had UCVA measured at 20 / 20 or better. For monovision (treated for <b>reading</b> <b>vision)</b> eyes, 29 (47 %) eyes and 19 (54 %) of VISX- and EX 500 -treated eyes, respectively, read J 1 + by one month post-operatively. By one year, 16 (39 %) and 3 (21 %) of available eyes read J 1 + after treatment with the VISX and EX 500 respectively. The relative enhancement rate was 7. 82 % (28 eyes) on the VISX and 4. 19 % (7 eyes) on the EX 500. CONCLUSION: Overall, visual outcomes of laser vision correction for hyperopic patients did not differ consistently between the two lasers. Only distance-treated eyes measured up to one year post-operatively showed a statistically significant difference between the two lasers. The visual and, more importantly, the refractive outcomes were statistically similar at both one month and up to one year post-operatively irrespective of treatment type. Enhancement rate between the two lasers also showed no differences. Both lasers are similarly safe and effective for treating hyperopia and hyperopic astigmatism. 2018 - 01 - 11 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E
