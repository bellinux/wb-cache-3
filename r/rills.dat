40|$|<b>Rill</b> {{networks}} {{which developed}} along bare hillslopes because of rainfall have very complex patterns. It {{is impossible to}} know the rate of erosion with time until we express quantitatively the figure of the <b>rill</b> patterns. As the <b>rill</b> patterns are usually similar to the river networks, application of Horton'law to the <b>rill</b> networks has been tried. In this study, the degree of complication of <b>rill</b> patterns that develop on hillslopes is described as entropy and fractal dimension which has generally non-integer values, by applying the two geometrical concepts of Spectrum and that of Fractal geometry. The entropy of <b>rill</b> patterns can be calculated from the power spectrum which can be obtained by decomposing the <b>rill</b> patterns into the several single harmonic function. On the other hand, fractal dimension can be easily computed by computer graphics. In addition to this analysis, the applicability of Horton's law to <b>rill</b> patterns was also considered. As a result of applying this analysis to the <b>rill</b> patterns which develop on bare hillslopes, the entropy and the fractal dimension of <b>rill</b> pattrns were closely related to the number of bifurcations of the <b>rill.</b> And applying Horton's first and second laws to the <b>rill</b> patterns, it becomes clear that only Horton's first law {{can be applied to the}} <b>rill</b> patterns...|$|R
40|$|After its formation, a <b>rill</b> {{may remain}} {{in the field for}} months, often {{receiving}} lower flow rates than the formative discharge. The objective of this work was to evaluate the <b>rill</b> flow transport capacity of soil aggregates at discharges unable to erode the <b>rill,</b> and to analyse the influence of the <b>rill</b> macro-roughness on this transport process. A non-erodible <b>rill</b> was built in which roughness was reproduced in detail. In order to assess only the <b>rill</b> macroroughness, a flat channel with a similar micro-roughness to that in the <b>rill</b> replica was built. <b>Rill</b> and channel experiments were carried out at a slope of 8 degrees and at six discharges (8. 3 x 10 (- 5) to 5. 2 x 10 (- 4) m(3) s(- 1)) in the <b>rill,</b> and eight discharges (1. 6 x 10 (- 5) to 5. 2 x 10 (- 4) m(3) s(- 1)) in the channel. Non-erodible aggregates of three sizes (1 - 2, 3 - 5 and 5 - 10 mm) were released at the inlet of the rill/channel. The number of aggregates received at the outlet was registered. The number and position of the remaining aggregates along the rill/channel were also determined. The <b>rill</b> flow was a major sediment transport mechanism only during the formation of the <b>rill,</b> as during that period the power of the flow was great enough to overcome the influence of the macro-roughness of the <b>rill</b> bed. At lower discharges the transport capacity in the previously formed <b>rill</b> was significantly less than that in the flat channel under similar slope and discharge. This was determined to be due to local slowing of flow velocities at the exit of <b>rill</b> pools. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. status: publishe...|$|R
500|$|Many of {{the male}} islanders {{utilised}} {{their knowledge of the}} Firth's currents to hire themselves out to passing vessels as maritime pilots. Their expertise was the product of a lifetime's experience on the waters of the Firth; as it was said, they had been [...] "dabbling in salt water from their childhood upwards". Indeed, the whole island was drenched in salt water thrown up by the powerful tides and storms to which it was subjected, particularly in the winter.

The islanders took advantage of this phenomenon by capturing the water in a reservoir to power a watermill which ground their grain in the winter months. It is not now known exactly where the mill was or what happened to it. Although it is described in the Statistical Account, written in the 1790s, and a Robert Miller is listed in the 1851 census as its miller, by 1861 he had moved to farm a five-acre croft and no further mention is made of the mill in contemporary accounts.|$|E

Two samples, one of 20 zero order catchments and the other of 15 catchments, were surveyed.

Composted organics are viewed as an alternative approach to improve construction site soils and to reduce runoff and soil erosion. The objective {{of this study is}} to evaluate the use of blanket-applied composted organics on <b>rill</b> erosion as compared to soils. <b>Rill</b> erosion was measured on three composted organics applied at 5 and 10 cm depths, a topsoil treatment (15 cm application), and the existing soil (control) on a highway embankment with a three-to-one sideslope (33 %). Treatments were tested using rainfall simulation at a target rate of 100 mm/h and simultaneously adding five inflows at the top of the <b>rill</b> on both vegetated and unvegetated plots. <b>Rill</b> erosion on blanket-applied compost treatments was measured, and the usefulness of the shear stress model for predicting <b>rill</b> erosion on compost-treated areas was assessed. <b>Rill</b> erodibilities and critical shear values were calculated for all treatments using the shear stress model that was originally developed for soil. <b>Rill</b> erodibilities were higher on topsoil-treated plots than on control and compost-treated areas. Yard waste had significantly lower <b>rill</b> erodibility than all other compost and soil treatments. There were no significant differences between critical shear values for the composts and soil.

Low R 2 values for compost erodibility and critical shear suggest that the shear stress model used in this analysis is not well suited for use with composted organics.

40|$|Experimental studies {{provide a}} basis for {{understanding}} the mechanisms of <b>rill</b> erosion and can provide estimates for parameter values in physical models simulating the erosion process. In this study, we investigated sediment delivery during <b>rill</b> erosion in purple soil. We used the volume-replacement method to measure the volume of eroded soil and hence estimate the mass of eroded soil. A 12 m artificial <b>rill</b> was divided into the following sections: 0 – 0. 5 m, 0. 5 – 1 m, 1 – 2 m, 2 – 3 m, 3 – 4 m, 4 – 5 m, 5 – 6 m, 6 – 7 m, 7 – 8 m, 8 – 10 m, and 10 – 12 m. Erosion trials were conducted with three flow rates (2 L/min, 4 L/min, and 8 L/min) and five slope gradients (5 °, 10 °, 15 °, 20 °, and 25 °). The eroded <b>rill</b> sections were refilled with water to measure the eroded volume in each section and subsequently calculate the eroded sediment mass. The cumulative sediment mass was used to compute the sediment concentration {{along the length of the}} <b>rill.</b> The results show that purple soil sediment concentration increases with <b>rill</b> length before eventually reaching a maximal value; that is, the rate of increase in sediment concentration is greatest at the <b>rill</b> inlet and then gradually slows. Steeper slopes and higher flow rates result in sediment concentration increasing more rapidly along the <b>rill</b> length and the maximum sediment concentration being reached at an earlier location in the <b>rill.</b> Slope gradient and flow rate both result in an increase in maximal sediment concentration and accumulated eroded amount. However, slope gradient has a greater influence on <b>rill</b> erosion than flow rate. The results and experimental method in this study may provide a reference for future rill-erosion experiments...|$|R

Focusing on the dynamic erosion characteristics of the <b>rill,</b> this paper expands the work of Rose and derives an improved approximate analytic solution for fully develop drill flow. This solution considers the influence of the bare soil erosion at the <b>rill</b> channel sides and the change of hydraulic radius, and it can return to Rose's solution automatically in the case of inter-rill erosion or generalize overland erosion situation. Laboratory experimental data on <b>rill</b> erosion by Lei et al. (2009) is employed to verify the solution, showing a good agreement except some very steep situations.
