40|$|In {{order to}} prevent a husband from co-ercing his wife into {{transferring}} her separate estate to him, {{in the late eighteenth}} century Lord Thurlow created an exception to the general rule that equity declares void any attempt to impose a direct restraint upon a disponee's powers of alienation. Henceforth a practice developed whereby property transferred for the separate use of a married woman was given "without power of anticipation", although a similarly worded limitation would suffice. The married woman was thereby disabled during coverture from alienating the property or anticipating its future income. Just as the restraint protected the wife against a predatory husband, it also operated against her creditors. While she could devise or bequeath the property in question, she could neither sell nor mortgage it, not could her creditors claim it in satisfaction of any debts she might have owed them. Courts of equity had no jurisdiction to override or modify a particular <b>restraint</b> <b>on</b> <b>alienation</b> in the interests of the married woman who was subject to it. Because of the basic economic changes caused by the Industrial Revolution with its attendant specialisation of the labour and concentration of production in factories, society also changed. It became more mobile and more urbanized and many wives gained employment in the new factories. Very little production was now carried out in the home and the husband, away-at work for long periods, found that his power position in the family was weakened. Since changes in the family had economic causes, these were most likely to be reflected in that field of the law most closely tied to the economy, that is, property. As the wife began to receive income (and in some cases, accumulate property), reform of the common law doctrine of coverture was imperative. Well-to-do women could enjoy the benefits of property drafted marriage settlements incorporating the equitable notions of separate estate and restraints on anticipation, but poorer women lacked these advantages and, to the extent that they had assets, they suffered the full rigours of the common law...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the more}} {{misunderstood}} concepts of Anglo-American law is the discovery doctrine, the principle by which Europeans rationalized their presence in North America. Misinterpretation of the doctrine led to unwarranted assumptions {{about the relationship between}} the federal government and indigenous tribes in the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries and to misinterpretations abroad, notably in Australia. These misinterpretations by judges and Congress made the discovery doctrine into what one scholar called a perfect instrument of empire. But this article maintains that this result was a perversion of the doctrine laid down in the early 19 th century by the Marshall Court. The article explains that the discovery doctrine, as articulated by the Marshall Court, actually produced very little immediate effects on native proprietary rights. However, Chief Justice Marshall laid the seeds for later misunderstandings by characterizing aboriginal title as sui generis, outside the conventional system of Anglo-America property law. In fact, had Marshall been better versed in property law, it would have been quite easy to conceptualize aboriginal title in conventional terms. Had he done so in the cases in which he used the discovery doctrine to shape native property, the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s interest in native lands would have been understood to be merely a right of preemption and the native interest to be a fee simple subject to a partial <b>restraint</b> <b>on</b> <b>alienation.</b> This interpretation would have been consistent with the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s oft-quoted phrase that Indian title is as sacred as the fee. The discovery doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s effect on tribal sovereignty turned out to be much more pernicious than its effect on native property rights. The doctrine not only foreclosed relations between the Indian tribes and foreign nations and led to exclusive federal control over native affairs, it also assumed that questions about federal-tribal relations were properly left to federal courts, the courts of the conqueror in Chief Justice Marshall 2 ̆ 7 s words. This decision on venue equipped Marshall 2 ̆ 7 s successors to erect a doctrine of plenary federal power on questionable authority and to use it to give sanction to unilateral federal breaching of treaties and the breaking up of the Indian land base. This article aims to clarify the discovery doctrine by examining its origins, its adoption by the Marshall Court, and its ensuing effects on native property rights and sovereignty. Among the legacies of the doctrine was an impetus to treaty-making, which enabled some tribes to reserve important natural resources for their use, so the results of the discovery doctrine were not all adverse to the tribes. The article explores the relationship between discovery and treaty-making and also a modern alternative to the erosion of inherent tribal sovereignty initiated by the discovery doctrine: delegated sovereignty under federal pollution control statutes. The article concludes that while Chief Justice Marshall would never have countenanced his successors 2 ̆ 7 interpretation of the discovery doctrine he articulated, understanding the origins, scope, and legacies of the doctrine remains foundational to native proprietary and sovereign rights in the modern world...|$|E

In some instances, the property rights concepts applicable to land often work even better for intangible property because some of the difficulties in designing landbased systems disappear.

40|$|This Article {{explores the}} {{lawfulness}} of servitudes on personal property in both common law and intellectual property regimes. The common law has from ancient times recognized the general right of owners of real property to burden land with {{restrictions on use}} [...] restrictions that 2 ̆ 2 run with the land 2 ̆ 2 [...] subject to various conditions and limitations. It has been more ambivalent about similar restrictions on personal property. Why? That question was broached seventy-five years ago by Zechariah Chafee, though he never fully answered it. Today, the question has acquired a new importance because of the pervasive use of computer software licensing restrictions that, for all practical purposes, {{can be regarded as}} a form of property servitude. Software licensing restrictions implicate specialized rules of intellectual property, such as the first sale doctrine. However, those rules are basically derived from common law policies (most notably policies against <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>alienation</b> and <b>restraints</b> of trade), so the question about the legality of such restrictions is essentially no different for intellectual property from that question in the context of personal property at common law. This Article argues that the traditional hostility to use and resale <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> personal property is misguided in both the common law and intellectual property contexts. While there may be legitimate reasons for limiting an owner 2 ̆ 7 s right to impose post-transfer restrictions on use and resale, those reasons are more exceptional than has been commonly assumed. Moreover, in the new digital world where servitude-type restrictions can be engineered into the architecture of the property itself, public policy restrictions on contractual 2 ̆ 2 servitudes 2 ̆ 2 may prove to be ineffectual, creating a new reason to take a fresh look at old conceptions of personal property servitudes...|$|R
40|$|A lengthy tug of {{war between}} the Supreme Court and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals may have ended when the Supreme Court held that {{the sale of a}} {{patented}} article exhausts the patentee seller’s rights to enforce restrictions on that article through patent infringement suits. Further, reversing the Federal Circuit, the parties cannot bargain around this rule through the seller’s specification of conditions stated at the time of sale, no matter how clear. No inquiry need be made into the patentee’s market power, anticompetitive effects, or other types of harms, whether enforcement of the condition is socially costly or valuable, or has a positive or negative impact on innovation. None of this is relevant. Lexmark was attempting to use patent law to impose a variable proportion tie – in this case, a requirement that users of its printers also use its own original equipment toner cartridges. The general although not unanimous consensus is that such arrangements are economically beneficial, and largely everyone agrees that they are beneficial when the seller lacks market power, as Lexmark did in this case. Impression Products reveals an economic deficiency that manifests all too frequently when patent law is brought to bear on market practices. Economic concepts such as market power or output effects which are commonly used in antitrust law are virtually unknown in patent law. This fact has inclined the courts to go to wild extremes – such as equating every patent with monopoly, or concluding that a patent is a mere property right and that anything done within the scope of the patent should therefore be permissible. The result, as in this case, can be draconian rules that are indifferent to effects on innovation, competition, economic efficiency, or any other measure seems relevant to innovation policy. One thing the Supreme Court did not discuss is the Patent Misuse Reform Act, which provides that no patent owner shall be denied relief in an infringement action because it “conditioned … the sale of the patented product on the … purchase of a separate product …, unless … the patent owner has market power…. ” That language clearly creates an exception to the exhaustion rule for tying arrangements where the defendant lacks market power. This paper considers whether the Supreme Court was correct to ignore that statute. The exhaustion rule also produces odd result of giving patentees an incentive to argue that components that they sell do not embody their own patents. If the product is not covered by a patent, then it is not exhausted. At this writing the issue is being litigated in the Apple v. Qualcomm dispute over Qualcomm’s post-sale restrictions on telecommunications components. The Supreme Court based its patent exhaustion holding <b>on</b> concerns about <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>alienation,</b> which it presented as rooted in the common law. But the common law’s rules <b>on</b> <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>alienation</b> are much more complex than the Supreme Court acknowledged. The common law typically upheld restraints that were limited in time, and restraints enforced by patent infringement actions are by definition limited by the life of the patent.

40|$|A private {{transfer}} fee (PTF) is typically created when a developer or homeowner decides {{to attach a}} covenant to {{the title of the}} home. This covenant, the PTF covenant, attaches the PTF to the real property. These covenants require payment of a fee—typically stated as one percent of the property 2 ̆ 7 s sale price—upon each resale or transfer of the property and often survive for a period of ninety-nine years. The recipients or owners of the PTF (PTF beneficiaries) can be almost anyone, including property developers, PTF developers, home owner associations (HOA), private investors, state governments, and non-profit charities. Usually, the PTF payment is designated to a trust in which a trustee retains a portion of the fee for expenses and pays the remainder of the fee to the PTF beneficiaries. Are PTFs a form of financial exploitation by developers or a reasonable financing vehicle? Proponents of PTF covenants argue that PTFs are financial instruments designed to spread out housing development costs and lower the costs of homeownership. Their opponents argue that PTFs lower housing values, surprise homebuyers with extra fees, create unreasonable <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>alienation,</b> and impair the marketability of tide. * PTFs can surprise potential homebuyers even when the PTF covenant is recorded and clearly identified;buyers often do not know that the property they are buying has a PTF convent until the closing.

40|$|In {{the absence}} of any {{guidance}} from the legislature, local officials, in confronting the problem of affordable housing, look to the courts to define the extent of their responsibility and power. While not providing specific direction, the New York Court of Appeals has clearly outlawed zoning designed to exclude affordable housing. The judiciary has voiced doubts, however, that municipal governments can, through zoning alone, require the development of affordable housing. The view that municipalities lack such power is erroneous. Zoning alone is competent to induce such development. Furthermore, local governments have considerable additional power to induce the creation of such housing. This Article will document this competence and authority of municipal governments to induce the development of affordable housing. Part II analyzes in detail the use of the traditional zoning powers of local governments to create affordable housing, and examines techniques such as conditional rezoning, floating zones, special permits and the application of a relatively new concept called “density zoning” or “incentive zoning. ” Part II also considers whether municipalities may meet “local” needs by granting occupancy preferences under such zoning schemes. In addition, this Part examines restrictions on the transfer of title to affordable housing in order to perpetuate that affordability, as well as common law rules such as the rule against perpetuities and the rule against unreasonable <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>alienation.</b> Part III looks at the untapped wealth of statutory authority that enables local governments to further reduce the cost of housing. Statutes provide the authority to facilitate affordable housing by granting property tax abatements, acquiring land by eminent domain, selling public land at favorable prices, issuing bonds to provide inexpensive permanent loans for affordable housing, and building supportive infrastructure, such as sidewalks, streets and sewers. Part IV concludes that an understanding of the plenary nature of this local authority can change the perceptions of the state courts in designing remedies for exclusionary zoning and that the state legislature can act more effectively to guide, encourage and direct local governments in exercising the authority delegated to them...|$|R

40|$|Vertical {{integration}} {{occurs when}} a firm does something for itself that it could otherwise procure on the market. For example, a manufacturer that opens its own stores {{is said to be}} vertically integrated into distribution. One irony of history is that both classical political economy and neoclassicism saw vertical integration and vertical contractual arrangements as much less threatening to competition than cartels or other horizontal arrangements. Nevertheless, vertical integration has produced by far the greater amount of legislation at both federal and state levels and has motivated many more political action groups. Two things explain this phenomenon. First, while economists prior to the 1930 s rarely saw a threat, neither did they understand why firms integrate or enter into long term contracts, except for fairly obvious savings in production costs. Second, vertical integration led to many bankruptcies of small family businesses unable or unwilling to take on the costs and associated risks of integrating vertically themselves. When that happened, politics inevitably triumphed over economics. Both the common law and classical economists tended to view vertical integration favorably. The principal limitation on vertical integration by contract was common law rules limiting <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>alienation.</b> The managerial revolution in the United States in the nineteenth century occasioned the rise of significant vertical integration. At the same time, however marginalist, or neoclassical, economics first began to see significant competitive problems. The emergent legal policy toward vertical control by contract was developed first in intellectual property law 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 first sale 2 ̆ 2 doctrine, and later on in antitrust policy. In his 1937 article on the 2 ̆ 2 Nature of the Firm, 2 ̆ 2 Ronald H. Coase formulated a purely marginalist theory of vertical integration, but it was ignored by both economists and legal policy makers for nearly half a century. Economists continued to wrestle with theories that were far more myopic, and as a result much less satisfactory. The result was that vertical integration became much more vulnerable to special interest legislation than did competition policy generally.
