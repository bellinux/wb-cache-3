40|$|In this paper, a tri-band-pass filter {{suitable}} for microwave applications is presented. The proposed <b>band</b> <b>pass</b> filter consists of four rectangular patches (cells) separated by four rectangular slots. The selectivity of the <b>pass</b> <b>bands</b> is adjusted by adjusting the position of transmission zeros (TZs). The locations of the TZs can be adjusted for different selectivity of the filter, by adjusting {{the dimensions of the}} rectangular cells. Also, the <b>band</b> <b>pass</b> filter’s centre frequency and bandwidth of the tri <b>pass</b> <b>bands</b> are independently adjusted by changing the length and width between <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> edges, which makes the design very simple.

40|$|A finite length linear {{chain of}} {{dielectric}} loss-less identical spheres is considered. A propagation of dipole radiation {{in the chain}} of particles induced by the point dipole source placed near one end of the chain is investigated. It is found that at sufficiently large refractive index there exist frequency <b>pass</b> <b>bands</b> around every low frequency Mie resonance. In particular, if the dipole oscillates across the chain axis, one can reveal a longitudinal mode frequency <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> if refractive index of the spheres exceeds 1. 9. Then, if the dipole oscillates transversely to the chain axis, the transverse frequencies <b>pass</b> <b>bands</b> show up depending on the chain length. In this case, the <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> is formed if the length chain is large enough. Three dielectric materials ZnO, rutile and GaAs are considered. It is found that the top of the frequency <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> corresponds {{to the top of the}} Brillouin band edge in the quasi-momentum space. On the order hand, the bottom of the frequency <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> corresponds to the guiding wave criterion. This explains the remarkable feature of the band picture established for infinite chain: the band structure breaks down as the wavevector becomes small enough. The multisphere Mie scattering formalism is used to calculate how the amplitude of the radiation changes along the chain...|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} temporal filtering is also applied {{on the low}} <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> of the wavelet {{decomposition of}} both sequences, but {{in a slightly different}} manner. In the case of the low <b>pass</b> wavelet <b>band,</b> we set the smoothing parameter to the local variance of noise at location l. The value of the smoothing parameter for the low <b>pass</b> wavelet <b>band</b> is less than for high <b>pass</b> wavelet <b>bands,</b> since the low <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> already contains much less noise due to the spatial low pass filtering. In this way, we address the appearance of low-frequency artefacts present in the regions of the sequence that contain less texture.|$|R

40|$|A {{propagation}} of dipolar radiation in a finite length linear chain of identical dielectric spheres is investigated using the multisphere Mie scattering formalism (MSMS). A frequency <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> {{is shown to}} be formed near every Mie resonances inherent in the spheres. The manifestation of the <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> depends on the polarization of the travelling radiation. To prove this effect, a point dipole placed {{by the end of}} the chain is used as an external source of radiation. It is found that, if this dipole is directed parallel to the to the chain axis, the frequency <b>pass</b> <b>bands</b> exist if the refractive index of dielectric spheres is sufficiently large. For the dipole normal to the chain axis, the <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> can always be formed if the chain is sufficiently long. Such a distinction is due to different behavior of the far-field dipolar interaction between the spheres induced by the external source. The edges of the <b>pass</b> <b>bands</b> are defined by the guiding wave criterion based on the light-cone constraint. The criterion of creation of the <b>pass</b> <b>bands</b> correlate with condition of formation of high quality factor modes in these systems found in our previous papers. A comparison with the results available for infinite chains is made. In particular, we clarify the nature of braking down the band structure for small enough wavevectors...|$|R

The 50 Ω microstrip line has a gap discontinuity {{in the middle and}} characterized by stepped impedance resonators on either half.

40|$|This article {{describes}} an electromagnetic stop-band (ESB) network for highefficiency class F power amplifiers, providing improved performance {{in both the}} <b>pass</b> <b>band</b> and stop band In a class F power amplifier, producing the required short circuit at even harmonics and the open circuit at the odd harmonics at the active device output can substantially increase efficiency of the power amplifier [1, 2]. With such harmonic tuning, the voltage across the active device output and current through it do not contain harmonics of the same order simultaneously. In practice, {{it is very difficult}} to control impedances for an infinite number of harmonics, and the so-called Third-Harmonic Peaking tuning is typically used. In this case, the input impedance of the output network is controlled up to third harmonic. A noticeable increase in efficiency can be achieved if a higher harmonics are also taken into account [3]. Recently, photonic bandgap (PBG) and defected-ground microstrip structures have been proposed as a novel way to accomplish filtering that provides a broad rejection band [4 - 11]. Such structures can be successfully used as the output networks of high-efficiency power amplifiers. As was suggested in [12], the terminology “electromagnetic stop-band” (ESB) is probably more appropriate than “photonic bandgap. ” ESB seems to be more commonly used for microwaves, so it is used in this paper. To achieve high amplifier efficiency, an output network should also provide acceptable matching at the fundamental frequency.
