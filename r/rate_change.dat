5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's {{climate system}} {{may have a}} natural resonance frequency of 100ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor spreading <b>rate</b> <b>change</b> have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impacts of}} <b>rating</b> <b>change</b> timing {{differences between the two}} leading agencies, namely, Standard and Poor&# 039;s and Moody&# 039;s with particular focus on the stock market impact of Standard and Poor&# 039;s Foreign Currency <b>rating</b> <b>changes</b> and Moody&# 039;s Bonds and Notes <b>rating</b> <b>changes.</b> The analysis focuses on whether there is a <b>rating</b> <b>change</b> pattern between these agencies and undertakes a comparison of the impact of <b>rating</b> <b>changes</b> on the markets between single <b>rating</b> <b>changes</b> and joint <b>rating</b> <b>changes.</b> The paper equally determines whether <b>rating</b> <b>changes</b> induce different reactions depending on the level of rating. The findings indicate that in contrast to the results obtained in previous literature, <b>rating</b> <b>change</b> announcements do not impart additional information to the market. An interesting finding is that joint downgrades seem to impact on the market only in-between the announcement dates for the two agencies. In addition, the reason of the <b>rating</b> <b>change</b> needs to be taken into consideration to assess the stock market reaction to <b>rating</b> <b>changes...</b>|$|R

The large sample of credit <b>rating</b> <b>changes</b> including proportionally more upgrades from low credit rating classes than downgrades is collected and the results suggesting the influence of downgrades on stock prices of company and any influence of upgrades persist.

40|$|In this paper, we {{have tested}} for {{volatility}} spillovers between stock returns and exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> for six countries, namely the US, the UK, Japan, Germany, Canada and France. Our findings can be summarised as follows. (a) Evidence of spillovers from stock returns to exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> is found for all countries except Germany. These {{results suggest that}} the asset approach to exchange rate determination is valid when formulated in terms of the second moments of the exchange rate distribution for these countries. (b) The spillovers from stock returns to exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> are symmetric in nature. (c) Volatility spillovers from exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> to stock returns are insignificant for all countries. The non-presence of spillovers from exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> to stock returns is in line with previous research which has focused on the first moments of the relevant distributions. (d) The correlation coefficient between the EGARCH filtered stock returns and exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> is negative and significant for all countries, indicating that there is a significant contemporaneous relationship between stock returns and exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes.</b> (e) Volatility spillovers from stock returns spillovers to exchange rates have increased since the October 1987 crash, perhaps because financial markets have become more closely integrated during this period.

40|$|Issuers’ {{credit ratings}} change {{by one or}} more notches when credit rating {{agencies}} provide new ratings. Unique to the literature, I study the influences affecting multi notch versus single notch rating upgrades and downgrades. For Standard & Poors data, I show that <b>rating</b> <b>changes</b> with multiple notches provide more information to the market than single notch <b>rating</b> <b>changes.</b> Consistent with prior literature on the business cycle, I show that investors value good news <b>rating</b> <b>changes</b> (upgrades) more in bad times (recession) and that investors value bad news <b>rating</b> <b>changes</b> (downgrades) more in good times (expansion). I model and test probit models using variables capturing the characteristics of the previous issuer’s credit rating, liquidity, solvency, profitability, and growth opportunity to determine the classification of single notch versus multi notch <b>rating</b> <b>changes.</b> The determinants of multi notch versus single notch <b>rating</b> <b>changes</b> for upgrades and downgrades differ. Business cycle influences are evident. Firms that have multi notch rating upgrades and downgrades have significantly different probit variables vis-à-vis firms that have single notch rating upgrades and downgrades. The important characteristics for determining multiple notch upgrades are a firm’s prior <b>rating</b> <b>change,</b> prior <b>rating,</b> cash flow, total assets and market value. The important characteristics for determining multiple notch downgrades are a firm’s prior <b>rating</b> <b>change,</b> prior <b>rating,</b> current ratio, interest coverage, total debt, operating margin, market to book ratio, capital expenditure, total assets, market value, and market beta. The variables that differ for multi notch upgrades in recessions are cash flow, net income, operating margin, market to book ratio, total assets, and retained earnings. The variables that differ for multi notch downgrades in expansions are a firm’s prior <b>rating</b> <b>change,</b> current ratio, interest coverage ratio, debt ratio, total debt, capital expenditure and market beta. The power of the explanatory tests improves when the stage of the business cycle is considered.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2006 Recent {{studies have}} noted a {{correlation}} between large earthquakes and localized seismicity <b>rate</b> <b>changes,</b> particularly those associated with volcanic systems. Few studies have been performed {{to determine if the}} background seismicity contains meaningful <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> in the absence of large earthquakes. The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) seismicity catalog is analyzed for background seismicity <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> at the monitored volcanoes throughout the Aleutian Arc. The primary analysis was to identify statistically significant seismicity <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> at the eighteen individual volcanic regions. Eleven volcanic regions had statistically significant background seismicity <b>rate</b> <b>changes.</b> Of particular interest are time periods when several volcanic regions have activity <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> close in time. Once the groups are established using several criteria, they are probabilistically analyzed. If they have a low probability of being random and independent, it is inferred that the activity changes are related to one another. Ten groups of volcanoes with activity changes are found and may be evidence of regional stress changes in the Aleutian Arc. Seven groups are composed of statistically independent activity rate changes; of which, three groups are robustly independent. Speculations as to the cause of some of the regional stress changes include regional earthquakes and slow slip events...|$|R
