5|$|Ranch Road 1 is {{classified}} by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) as a Ranch Road, {{and is the}} only highway in the state to be currently categorized as so. The route is not officially part of the state's Farm and Ranch to Market <b>Road</b> <b>System,</b> although it is considered similar to the Farm to Market <b>Road</b> <b>system.</b> RR 1 is signed with a shield similar to a Ranch to Market Road. The highway fits almost perfectly with the Recreational Road classification, but is not considered part of the system.|$|E

5|$|At the Menominee–Delta county line, M-35 {{passes from}} the Central to the Eastern Time Zone. After passing {{the south side}} of Escanaba, M-35 runs into town on Lake Shore Drive, passing to the south and east of the Delta County Airport before turning onto Lincoln Road. Just west of downtown, US2/US41 join M-35 at the {{intersection}} of Ludington Street and Lincoln Road. Ludington and Lincoln form the east–west and north–south axes respectively of the Escanaba street numbering grid. From these two streets, the east–west avenues and north–south streets are numbered in a grid in the City of Escanaba. US2/US41 enter Escanaba from the west along Ludington Street, turning north along Lincoln Road, joining M-35. Here, M-35 joins the National Highway System, which is a <b>road</b> <b>system</b> important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Burnside's <b>road</b> <b>system</b> was {{completely}} bitumenised during the 1960s and 1970s through government-sponsored roadworks programmes. Plans were also laid out {{to replace the}} winding and dangerous Mount Barker Road. One of these proposals was the Burnside-Crafers Highway, which was strongly supported by council; it envisaged leaving Greenhill Road once reaching Hazelwood Park. It was then to pass through Hazelwood Park and Beaumont, wind around the hills of Waterfall Gully and then go over Eagle on the Hill to meet Crafers. The Burnside Council put much effort into this proposal, widening Linden Avenue (which runs north-west to south-east) {{in preparation for the}} highway. The proposal was eventually rejected in favour of upgrading Mount Barker Road and Linden Avenue remained a huge out-of-place road running through an otherwise peaceful suburb.|$|E
5|$|Groesbeck Highway runs {{northeast}} from Hoover Street crossing out of Wayne County into Macomb County at 8 Mile Road. The trunkline here is {{parallel to}} railroad tracks through Warren. M-97 crosses Interstate 696 (I-696) at an interchange located on the Warren–Roseville line. This interchange is also located at the 11 Mile Road location in the Mile <b>Road</b> <b>System.</b> M-97 crosses through {{the southeast corner of}} Fraser between 13 Mile and 14 Mile roads after which it enters Clinton Township. There is a major intersection with Metropolitan Parkway, which is a limited access county primary road that occupies the 16 Mile location Detroit Mile <b>Road</b> <b>System.</b> Between this intersection and Harrington Street, Groesbeck Highway curves around to the north, crossing the Clinton River and the railroad then entering Mt. Clemens. M-97 continues to curve around the west side of downtown Mt. Clemens before re-entering Clinton Township. Groesbeck Highway and M-97 ends at M-59/Hall Road, another limited access county primary road in Macomb County located in place of 20 Mile Road. The northern terminus is on the Clinton Township–Macomb Township line northwest of Selfridge Field, an Air National Guard facility on Lake St. Clair. The road continues north as a county road known as North Avenue.|$|E

5|$|In 1963, the State Roads Commission, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Public Roads (the {{predecessor}} of the Federal Highway Administration) (FHWA) created tentative {{plans to}} transfer the NPS segment of the parkway {{to the state of}} Maryland, who would then rebuild it to modern freeway standards, with trucks and buses permitted throughout.

40|$|The {{application}} of Q-analysis to <b>road</b> transport <b>systems</b> is introduced in this paper, but no {{prior knowledge of}} the methodology is assumed. It is argued that the route-link relation of transport systems has a connectivity structure overlooked by conventional transportation theory, and that this structure constrains traffic flow. This is illustrated at the micro-level by a complicated road intersection, and at the macro-level with a simple analysis of a town. The representation of <b>road</b> <b>systems</b> is discussed in this context, and it leads to a new result called the Link Face Theorem. It is suggested that the conventional theory can be usefully extended by studying the latent structure of <b>road</b> <b>systems</b> which is presently overlooked. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potentials}} of applying Space Syntax methodology {{to analyze the}} effects of urban configuration on cities' transport performance. The empirical analysis takes {{as a case study}} the Federal District (Brazil) and its 19 administrative regions considering its urban <b>road</b> <b>systems</b> configurations. Based on Simple Linear Regressions, the paper analyzes the effects that urban configurations with different integration degrees tend to have on the average time spent in car trips within those <b>road</b> <b>systems.</b> The integration degrees are calculated using traditional configurational variables as well as topo-geometric variables. The results indicate that traditional topological measures are of little use in studies on the effects of road configuration on urban transportation performance. In addition, topo-geometric measures have shown much better results. Finally, preliminary findings suggest that more integrated and compact <b>road</b> <b>systems</b> (regarding topological and geometrical terms) tend to provide more efficient urban configurations for the cities' transport performance...|$|R

In the early 1980s, the volume of traffic around the West Gate was causing damage to the structure of the building. The remaining walls and West Gate are protected under UK law as scheduled monuments and as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
