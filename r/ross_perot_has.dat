50|$|The American Reform Party {{is a minor}} {{political}} action committee in the United States that was formed in a factional split from the larger Reform Party of the United States in October 1997.

Maine has voted Democratic since 1992, and is the only state other than Nebraska to split its electoral votes. The last time Maine went Republican was for George H. W. Bush and Dan Quayle in 1988. Third Party candidate <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> a lesser impact this time, only drawing 14% of the vote, compared to 30% in 1992. This would still be where Perot received the highest percentage of votes in 1996.|$|R

[...] Information provided by Geoff Pryor...|$|R
500|$|<b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> {{never been}} elected to public office, but he ran several {{successful}} corporations and was involved in public affairs for decades. After serving in the United States Navy in the 1950s, Perot joined IBM as a salesman. He surpassed his one-year sales quota in just two weeks. After the company ignored his idea for electronic storage, he founded Electronic Data Systems in 1962, which was then contracted by the United States Government to store Medicare records. Perot earned a fortune with the company, and by 1968 was named by Fortune as the [...] "fastest, richest Texan." [...] Perot was known to run the company in a militaristic fashion, built on loyalty and duty. His best known venture with the company was in 1979, when he sent a private militia into Iran {{in the midst of}} the Iranian Revolution to rescue two of his employees who had been imprisoned. The episode inspired the 1983 novel, On Wings of Eagles. Perot eventually sold his company to General Motors in 1984 for $2.55 billion, and founded Perot Systems in 1988. By 1992, his fortune was judged to be $3 billion.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect of}} <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot's</b> {{candidacy}} <b>has</b> been a contentious point of debate for many years. In the ensuing {{months and years}} after the election, various Republicans asserted that <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> acted as a spoiler, enough {{to the detriment of}} Bush to lose him the election. While many disaffected conservatives may <b>have</b> voted for <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but of the voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important," [...] two thirds voted for Bill Clinton. A mathematical look at the voting numbers reveals that Bush would have had to win 12.2% of Perot's 18.8% of the vote, 65% of Perot's support base, to earn a majority of the vote, and would have needed to win nearly every state Clinton won by less than five percentage points. Furthermore, Perot's best results were in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, or carried few electoral votes, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. Perot appealed to disaffected voters all across the political spectrum who had grown weary of the two-party system. NAFTA played a role in Perot's support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues.|$|R

Perot's anti-NAFTA stance played a role in his support, and Perot voters were relatively moderate on hot button social issues such as abortion and gay rights.|$|R
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to the United States a few days later, McCain was reunited with his wife Carol and his family. [...] She had {{suffered}} her own crippling, near-death ordeal during his captivity, due to an automobile accident in December 1969 that left her hospitalized for six months and facing twenty-three operations and ongoing physical therapy. Businessman and POW advocate <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> paid for her medical care. By the time McCain saw her, she was four inches (ten centimeters) shorter, on crutches, and substantially heavier. As a returned POW, McCain became a celebrity of sorts: The New York Times ran a story and front-page photo of him getting off the plane at Clark Air Base in the Philippines; he authored a thirteen-page cover story describing his ordeal and his support for the Nixon administration's handling of the war in U.S. News & World Report; he participated in parades in Orange Park and elsewhere and made personal appearances before groups, where he showed strong speaking skills; he was given the key to the city of Jacksonville, Florida; and a photograph of him on crutches shaking the hand of President Richard Nixon at a White House reception for returning POWs became iconic. [...] The McCains became frequent guests of honor at dinners hosted by Governor of California Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy Reagan, and John McCain made a strong impression speaking at a large prayer breakfast hosted by the governor. [...] McCain had admired Ronald Reagan while in captivity and afterwards, believing him a man who saw honor in Vietnam service and a potential leader would not lead the nation into a war it was unwilling to win.|$|R

While many disaffected conservatives may <b>have</b> voted for <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> to protest Bush's tax increase, further examination of the Perot vote in the Election Night exit polls not only showed that Perot siphoned votes nearly equally among Bush and Clinton, but roughly two-thirds of those voters who cited Bush's broken [...] "No New Taxes" [...] pledge as [...] "very important" [...] (25%) [...] voted for Bill Clinton. The voting numbers reveal that to win the electoral vote Bush would have had to win 10 of the 11 states Clinton won by less than five percentage points. For Bush to earn a majority of the popular vote, he would have needed 12.2% of Perot's 18.9% of the vote, 65% of Perot's support base. State exit polls suggested that Perot did not alter the electoral college count, except potentially in one state (Ohio), which nonetheless showed a result in the margin of error. Furthermore, Perot was most popular in states that strongly favored either Clinton or Bush, limiting his real electoral impact for either candidate. He gained relatively little support in the Southern states and happened to have the best showing in states with few electoral votes.

50|$|Some {{commentators}} identify <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot's</b> 1992 U.S. Presidential {{campaign as}} the first radical middle national campaign. However, many radical centrist authors were not enthusiastic about <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot.</b> Matthew Miller acknowledges that <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> enough principle to support a gasoline tax hike, Halstead and Lind note that he popularized the idea of balancing the budget, and John Avlon says he crystallized popular distrust of partisan extremes. But none of those authors examines Perot's ideas or campaigns in depth, and Mark Satin does not mention Perot at all.|$|R
50|$|Arkansas was won by President Bill Clinton (D-AR) by a 17 {{percentage}} point margin of victory. The {{presidential election in}} the Natural State was a critical victory for the Democratic ticket, because Arkansas is Clinton's home state.

Perot in 1996 won 7.9 {{percent of the popular}} vote in the Natural State, a significant total for a third party candidate. As of 2016, the 1996 election was the last time that a Democratic presidential nominee has won in Arkansas; the state has gone Republican in each subsequent presidential election, starting in 2000.|$|R

50|$|In 1992, {{third-party}} Presidential candidate <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> {{proposed that}} future Social Security benefits {{be subjected to}} a means test; though this was hailed {{by some as a}} potential solution to an impending crisis in funding the program, few other political candidates since <b>Perot</b> <b>have</b> publicly made the same suggestion, which would require costly investigations and might associate accepting those benefits with social stigma.|$|R
5|$|The <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> presidential {{campaign}} of 1992 began when Texas industrialist <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> opened {{the possibility of}} running for President of the United States in the election of 1992 as an independent candidate on the February 20, 1992 edition of Larry King Live. Though he had never served as a public official, <b>Perot</b> <b>had</b> experience {{as the head of}} several successful corporations and had been involved in public affairs for the previous three decades. Spawned by the American dissatisfaction with the political system, grassroots organizations sprang up in every state to help Perot achieve ballot access following his announcement. James Stockdale, a retired United States Navy vice admiral, was Perot's vice presidential running mate.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, {{industrialist}} <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot,</b> who <b>had</b> received 18.9 {{percent of}} the vote during his Independent 1992 run for president, formed the Reform Party of the United States of America Though Perot won the party's 1996 nomination and garnered 8.4 {{percent of the}} popular vote, rifts had begun forming within the party. Former Colorado Governor Richard Lamm, who unsuccessfully challenged Perot for the 1996 presidential nomination, accused Perot of using the party as a personal vehicle, and broke off with his supporters to form a new party. In 1998, former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura was elected Governor of Minnesota {{as a member of the}} Reform Party—the party's most significant victory—but Perot and his followers were not receptive to Ventura and his political allies. The Perot faction adamantly, though unsuccessfully, attempted to prevent the election of Ventura supporter Jack Gargan as party chairman in 1999 when Perot backer Russ Verney chose not to stand for re-election for his term ending January 1, 2000. Opting not to run for president himself in 2000, Ventura searched for candidates. Initially, he courted WWF Board Member and former Connecticut governor Lowell P. Weicker, Jr.. He then turned to friend and wrestling aficionado Donald Trump.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the second}} 1992 Presidential Debate, <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> argued: We <b>have</b> {{got to stop}} sending jobs overseas. It's pretty simple: If you're paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for factory workers and you can move your factory south of the border, pay a dollar an hour for labor,...have no health care—that's the most {{expensive}} single element in making a car— have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement, and you don't care about anything but making money, {{there will be a}} giant sucking sound going south. ...when Mexico's jobs come up from a dollar an hour to six dollars an hour, and ours go down to six dollars an hour, and then it's leveled again. But in the meantime, you've wrecked the country with these kinds of deals.Perot ultimately lost the election, and the winner, Bill Clinton, supported NAFTA, which went into effect on January 1, 1994.|$|R

50|$|Georgia was won by Senator Bob Dole (R-KS) by {{a narrow}} 1.2 {{percentage}} point margin of Victory. The presidential election in the Peach state was the third closest contest that year in any state with only Kentucky and Nevada being closer.

Billionaire businessman <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot</b> (Ref-TX), who <b>had</b> unsuccessfully run for president as an Independent in the previous election, won 6.4% {{of the popular vote}} in the Peach state, a significant total for a third party candidate.

500|$|The {{actions of}} the {{committee}} were designed to allow for improved ties between the two countries, although that goal was not shared by {{a large segment of}} Republicans. [...] McCain pressed for normalization of diplomatic relations with Vietnam, partly because it was [...] "a time to heal ... it's a way of ending the war; it's time to move on," [...] and partly because he saw it in the U.S. national interest to do so, in particular envisioning Vietnam as a valuable regional counterbalance against China. [...] In 1994 the Senate passed a resolution, sponsored by Kerry and McCain, that {{called for an end to}} the existing trade embargo against Vietnam; it was intended to pave the way for normalization. [...] During his time on the committee and afterward, McCain was vilified as a fraud, traitor, or [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] by some POW/MIA activists who believed that large numbers of American servicemen were still being held against their will in Southeast Asia. They were angry that McCain did not share their belief and that he sought to normalize relations with Vietnam. [...] McCain's high profile on the Vietnam issue also cost him the friendship of some fellow former POWs; [...] McCain and 1992 independent presidential candidate <b>Ross</b> <b>Perot,</b> who <b>had</b> helped McCain's wife Carol during her husband's captivity, also had a falling out over the POW/MIA issue, which then extended to Perot blasting McCain's remarriage to Cindy McCain.
