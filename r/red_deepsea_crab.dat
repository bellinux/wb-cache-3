40|$|The <b>red</b> <b>deepsea</b> <b>crab</b> (Chaceon quinquedens (Smith, 1879)) has {{supported}} a commercial fishery {{off the coast}} of New England since the 1970 s (Wigley et al., 1975) and has had annual harvests from 400 metric tons (t) (1996) to 4000 t (2001) (NEFMC, 2002). In 2002, a fishery management plan for the northeast fishery on the Atlantic coast was implemented and total allowable catch was reduced to approximately 2500 t (NEFMC, 2002). Although there are management plans for the golden crab (C. fenneri) and the red deep sea crab for Atlantic coast regions, there is no fishery management plan for red deepsea crabs in the Gulf of Mexico. Successful management for sustainable harvests should be based on a knowledge of the life history of the species, but C. quinquedens has been a difficult species for which to obtain life history and abundance information because of its deep distribution...|$|E
50|$|Chaceon fenneri, {{commonly}} known as the golden <b>crab</b> or golden <b>deepsea</b> <b>crab,</b> is one of several species of crab harvested for food by humans. It was formerly called Geryon fenneri. Like the blue crab, its common name comes from the color of its shell; it is usually cream to tan in color. Both parts of the binomen Chaceon fenneri commemorate Fenner A. Chace, Jr. It is found on the ocean floor at depths of 200 to(-) 1500 m in the tropical west Atlantic, ranging from the Gulf of Mexico to Brazil. It cannot swim. The carapace of this large crab measures up to 20 cm, making the entire animal similar in size to a dinner plate. Its diet includes benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms like mollusks and worms.|$|R
50|$|Its body is {{very smooth}} {{and is usually}} pink or red colored. Its tentacles are long, stout and graceful in full expansion. It is capable of {{shedding}} its tentacles, pinching off by muscular action. The body is often serves as protection for other animals, like the <b>Deepsea</b> King <b>Crab</b> (Lithodes maja).|$|R
