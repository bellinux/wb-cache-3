Company (Limited Company) as one satuwajib corporate taxes should be able to plan the amount of taxes to be paid to the government for corporate profits to remain stable from year to year, so the company is not burdened with the tax. Strategies to minimize taxes for corporate profits remain high. One of them is tax avoidance (tax evasion is still in the applicable tax laws). Tax avoidance is a tax management, which can be achieved in three stages, namely, tax planning (tax planning), implementation of tax obligations (tax implementation), and control (tax contorl).

5000|$|The Edmondson railway ticket was {{a system}} for {{recording}} the payment of railway fares and accounting for the revenue raised, introduced in the 1840s.

Previously, railway companies had used handwritten tickets, as was the practice for stagecoaches, but it was laborious for a ticket clerk to write out a ticket for each passenger and long queues were common at busy stations. A faster means of issuing pre-printed tickets was needed.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveA patient-specific drug safety-efficacy {{index was}} {{developed}} that combined objective clinical trial information about dose-related efficacy and toxicity with subjective perspectives on efficacy-toxicity trades. MethodsPatient preferences were systematically assessed using the probability tradeoff technique (PTT). Toxicity ranges over which a drug's efficacy exceeded the patient's minimally acceptable efficacy represented ranges of “surplus efficacy. ” These {{can be related}} to the dose interval in which a drug delivers this surplus efficacy. Seventy surplus efficacy functions (for 7 hypothetical drugs and 10 hypothetical preference curves) were simulated. ResultsThe analysis showed that index values change markedly by dose and patient preference, suggesting that different patients will benefit from different drugs depending on the dose prescribed and each patient's subjective assessment of the efficacy/toxicity tradeoff. In most situations, drugs achieve positive surplus efficacy only over limited dose ranges. The model was sensitive to different preference curves and discriminated well among drugs with different efficacy or safety profiles. ConclusionThis index provides a new, systematic approach to choosing a specific therapeutic intervention and dosage, when known risks and benefits are <b>reconciled</b> <b>against</b> patient-specific preferences among an array of therapeutic alternatives...|$|E
40|$|Edmund Leach's data on {{kinship and}} {{marriage}} {{is the starting}} point for a network analysis of marriage exchange and the bilateral devolution of property. The analysis resolves the "Dravidian controversy" over the possibility of fit between the egocentric perspective of dual organization encoded in the Dravidian languages of South Asia and a sociocentric dual organization that is NOT based on matrimonial moieties and unilineal descent, but a more flexible and network-based application of marriage strategies. A network concept of "sidedness" is developed as a new alternative to the moiety concept for dual matrimonial organization. In a significant number of cases where Pul Eliyan villagers marry cousins or other types of consanguineal kin, perfect sidedness is maintained in the actual network of kinship and marriage relations, consistent with the Dravidian "two-sided" terminology of direct matrimonial exchange. The Pul Eliya material illustrates a system of social rules and strategies that are <b>reconciled</b> <b>against</b> each other in the freedom to realign and readjust terminological discrepancies in favor of a continually reemergent but consistent network structure of dual matrimonial organization that lacks a basis in a strict rule of descent...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{significance}} of 'Presbyterian Realism' {{in the context of}} Scottish painting {{in the last quarter of}} the nineteenth century, with particular reference to the early development of Arthur Melville. Melville travelled in Egypt and Persia in 1881 -' 82, reflecting the contemporary taste for Eastern subjects at the Salon and Royal Academy exhibitions. However Melville's reactions to Islam contrasted directly with his peers, whose choice and treatment of contentious themes reveal the mentality of the imperialist male bourgeoisie. Melville's redefinition of Orientalism can be attributed to the particular social, religious, moral and ethical codes he had absorbed during his formative years, a conditioning which ensured that his patrons and the governing elite in Scotland were in sympathy with his approach. The unity of discourse between these indigenous codes and the aesthetic of Melville's protomodernism' is also examined. Melville emerged from the Scottish landscape and genre school towards 'proto-modernism', where his more radical stylistic and optical advances were <b>reconciled</b> <b>against</b> traditional themes. He was one of the first modern Scottish artists to live and work in Paris, and the reasons for the reluctant assimilation of the industrialised urban environment into his art are discussed in the context of his Scottish peers and contemporary French movements...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityApproximately 35 % {{of older}} adults will {{experience}} an adverse drug event (ADE). Older adults are particularly vulnerable to ADEs following transfer from the acute care to home because of the addition of new medications and/or removal of previous ones during hospitalization. The home care clinician can positively affect the outcome of these changes by compiling a list of medications taken by the older adult in the home setting and <b>reconciling</b> it <b>against</b> the list of medications from any recent acute care discharge. While examining the medications taken by the older adult, the home care clinician should also look for medications known to be of high risk in older adult populations using tools such as the Institute for Safe Medication Practices List of High Alert Medications. Interviewing clients to determine if prescribed medications are causing any unanticipated side effects, or reactions, or if there are issues related to nonadherence is also necessary. Any potential medication issues discovered should be investigated and communicated to the older adult's physician(s) and pharmacist(s). Once the reconciliation process is completed, a compressive and accurate list of medicines should be shared with the older adult client {{as well as the}} pharmacy and other healthcare professionals involved in the client's care.
