5|$|Muslim {{residents}} of Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally {{allowed to enter}} the Temple Mount and pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the entrances to the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times restrictions have prevented all men under 50 and women under 45 from entering, but married men over 45 are allowed. Sometimes the <b>restrictions</b> <b>are</b> enforced {{on the occasion of}} Friday prayers, other times they are {{over an extended period of}} time. <b>Restrictions</b> <b>are</b> most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. The Israeli government states that the <b>restrictions</b> <b>are</b> in place for security reasons.|$|E
5|$|According to Human Rights Watch, the Shia {{minority}} face systematic discrimination {{from the}} Saudi government in education, {{the justice system}} and especially religious freedom. <b>Restrictions</b> <b>are</b> imposed on the public celebration of Shia festivals such as Ashura and on the Shia taking part in communal public worship.|$|E
5|$|Fund {{accounting}} {{distinguishes between}} two primary classes of fund. Those funds {{that have an}} unrestricted use, that can be spent for any purposes by the organisation and those that have a restricted use. The reason for the restriction can be {{for a number of}} different reasons. Examples include legal requirements, where the moneys can only be lawfully used for a specific purpose, or a restriction imposed by the donor or provider. These donor/provider <b>restrictions</b> <b>are</b> usually communicated in writing and may be found in the terms of an agreement, government grant, will or gift.|$|E

5|$|It is {{expected}} that reopening the station will result in reduced car usage to and from Pill and the surrounding villages. Most station users will walk to the station, with the next largest share being car drivers and car passengers being dropped off, followed by cyclists and bus users. Some parking <b>restrictions</b> <b>are</b> proposed to prevent rail users parking on the local streets, which are narrow and not suitable for widening.|$|E
5|$|In October the {{dry season}} sets in across much of Florida (starting early in the month in {{northern}} Florida and {{near the end of}} the month in deep southern Florida) and lasts until late April in most years. Fronts from mid-latitude storms north of Florida occasionally pass through northern and central parts of the state which bring light and brief winter rainfall. Mid and late winter can become severely dry in Florida. In some years {{the dry season}} becomes quite severe and water <b>restrictions</b> <b>are</b> imposed to conserve water. While most areas of Florida do not experience any type of frozen precipitation, north Florida can see fleeting snow or sleet a few times each decade.|$|E
5|$|Since July 2006, {{trading is}} open Mondays through Thursdays. Exports from India {{exempted}} from duty include agricultural implements, blankets, copper products, clothes, cycles, coffee, tea, barley, rice, wheat, flour, dry fruits, vegetables, vegetable oil, tobacco, snuff, spices, shoes, kerosene oil, stationery, utensils, milk processed products, canned food, dyes, and local herbs. Chinese exports to India exempted from duty include goat skin, sheep skin, wool, raw silk, yak tail, yak hair, china clay, borax, butter, common salt, horses, goats, and sheep. <b>Restrictions</b> <b>are</b> placed on traders, with permits only given {{to those who}} were Sikkimese citizens before the kingdom merged with India in 1975.|$|E
50|$|The first <b>restriction</b> <b>is</b> {{taken from}} FRC {{for the purpose}} of {{balancing}} the power of colorbound bishops. The second <b>restriction</b> <b>is</b> based upon the first restriction but extrapolated to the piece set used by CRC. The third <b>restriction</b> <b>is</b> taken from FRC to preserve castling ability. The fourth restriction helps to minimize the advantage held by White in having the first move. The fifth <b>restriction</b> <b>is</b> to avoid possible legal issues in America with Gothic Chess, which was formerly protected by a US patent. The sixth <b>restriction</b> <b>was</b> introduced later upon discovery by Scharnagl that such positions might increase the advantage of first move for White.|$|R

30|$|Non-finite {{complements}} {{are reduced}} clauses that lack an overt subject; the embedded verbs are not inflected for TAM. In the literature (Tang 1999), an AV-only <b>restriction</b> <b>is</b> often {{treated as a}} non-finite <b>restriction</b> that <b>is</b> imposed on the complement clause. However, this study revealed that some reduced complement clauses, which were not characterized by an AV-only <b>restriction,</b> <b>were</b> still non-finite, with the embedded verbs unable to take any TAM markers. In this sense, an AV-only <b>restriction</b> <b>is</b> not the only indication of non-finiteness in Mayrinax Atayal.|$|R
5|$|The {{practice}} of circumcision {{is thought to}} have been brought to the Bantu-speaking tribes of Africa by either the Jews after one of their many expulsions from European countries, or by Muslim Moors escaping after the 1492 conquest of Spain. In {{the second half of the}} 1st millennium CE, inhabitants from the North East of Africa moved south and encountered groups from Arabia, the Middle East, and West Africa. These people moved south and formed what is known today as the Bantu. Bantu tribes were observed to be upholding what was described as Jewish law, including circumcision, in the 16th century. Circumcision and elements of Jewish dietary <b>restrictions</b> <b>are</b> still found among Bantu tribes.|$|E
5|$|Singapore's {{political}} {{model has}} been described as a representative democracy, and Singaporeans have constitutional rights to freedom of speech and assembly under Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. The constitutional rights to free speech and assembly extend only to Singapore citizens. Hence, the Singapore Court of Appeal has held that non-citizens enjoy only common law free speech. Articles 14(1)(a) and (b) are then subject to Articles 14(2)(a) and (b) which allow Parliament to impose, by law, restrictions on the rights to freedom of speech and assembly. The grounds for <b>restrictions</b> <b>are,</b> for freedom of speech, Singapore's security, friendly relations with other states, public order, public morality, protecting parliamentary privilege, defamation, contempt of court and incitement to any criminal offence; and for freedom of assembly, public order only. These restrictions made it a lengthy and difficult process to obtain the licence required to address a public gathering.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sport}} of cricket, {{different}} fielding <b>restrictions</b> <b>are</b> imposed {{depending on the type}} of match. They are used to discourage certain bowling tactics, or to encourage the batsmen to play big shots, enabling them to hit fours and sixes. Each team has nine fielders other than the wicket-keeper and bowler. The captain decides the fielding positions usually after consulting with the bowler. In Test cricket matches, the fielding <b>restrictions</b> <b>are</b> relaxed as compared to a One Day International.|$|E

50|$|Waller, Kennerley and Ohanian (2007) {{argued that}} both bingeing-vomiting and <b>restriction</b> <b>are</b> emotion {{suppression}} strategies, {{but they are}} just utilized at different times.

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of diesel-electric motive power, concerns were voiced about the possible danger of having double headed trains using the bridge from 1970. A speed <b>restriction</b> <b>was</b> placed on diesel-electric locomotives using the bridge (20 km/h) {{similar to that used}} for larger steam locomotives. <b>Restrictions</b> <b>were</b> made to cover all trains using the bridge, ensuring that one train only was allowed occupancy of the bridge when passing. The <b>restrictions</b> <b>were</b> not removed until 1975 when the removal of the eastern set of rails was undertaken, thereby singling the double bridge.|$|R
