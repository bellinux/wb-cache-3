We prove two type of weighted Lp inequalities for Iγ,bm {{in the context}} of the spaces of homogeneous type. The first one establishes that, for A∞ weights, the operator Iγ,bm is bounded in the weighted Lp norm by the maximal operator Mγ(Mm), where Mγ is the fractional maximal operator and Mm is the Hardy–Littlewood maximal operator iterated m times. The second inequality is a consequence of the first one and shows that the operator Iγ,bm is bounded from Lp[Mγp(M[(m+ 1) p]w) (x) dμ(x) ] to Lp[w(x) dμ(x) ], where [(m+ 1) p] is the integer part of (m+ 1) p and no condition on the weight w is <b>required.</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> inequality we also obtain weighted Lp–Lq estimates for Iγ,bm generalizing the classical results of Muckenhoupt and Wheeden for the fractional integral operator...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the role and potential benefit of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF, Filgrastim), administered following cytotoxic chemotherapy with the ABVD regimen in Hodgkin's disease, in maintaining cycle schedule and dose intensity and in decreasing neutropenia and number of infections. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients affected by high-risk Hodgkin's disease (14 localized and 8 diffuse), aged 15 to 69 years (median, 34), were given ABVD chemotherapy for a total of 6 courses (for the purpose of this study, each single course of chemotherapy was considered as two 15 -day periods). No patient was given G-CSF after the first cycle. After each cycle, G-CSF was administered only for: 1) absolute neutrophil count < 1 x 10 (9) /L between cycles; 2) delay in cycle schedule due to an absolute neutrophil count < 1 x 10 (9) /L on the planned day of treatment; or 3) fever or a documented infection, regardless the absolute neutrophil count. Once administered, G-CSF was maintained in the subsequent cycles. RESULTS: Seventeen of 22 patients (77 %) required the administration of G-CSF (5 micrograms/kg b. w.; a median of 5 doses/cycle); most of them (13 / 17) before the 5 th dose of chemotherapy. The main reason for introducing G-CSF into therapy was neutropenia during the interval between courses (n = 4) or on the planned day of treatment (n = 11). Comparing 112 courses where G-CSF was not administered with 124 where it was, in the latter group we observed: 1) a significantly lower (P = 0. 0002) incidence of cycle delays (0 vs 13), with a median delay of 7 days (5 to 11). The main reason for cycle delay was neutropenia (n = 13); 2) a greater dose intensity delivered to the patients while on G-CSF (100 % vs 95. 2 +/- 8. 8 %; P = 0. 0001); 3) an absolute neutrophil count significantly higher at day 8 (P < 0. 0001) and day 15 (P < 0. 0001); 4) a significantly lower (P = 0. 0003) incidence of neutropenia (2 vs. 17). No difference in the incidence of infections was observed between the two groups of cycles (P = 0. 5889), but the duration and severity of the same were greater during chemotherapy without G-CSF, requiring antibiotic therapy and causing cycle delay. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our data suggest the use of Filgrastim in Hodgkin's disease also during conventional-dose chemotherapy with ABVD. It is not <b>required</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> dose of therapy, but as soon as neutropenia appears between cycles or on the planned day of treatment. Then, its use allows maintenance of the chemotherapy schedule and dose intensity. It also decreases frequency, duration and severity of neutropenia and its sequelae...|$|E
40|$|For the {{applicability}} of a SAR system as a radiometric measurement system, the knowledge of its end to end gain, from the raw data acquisition to the ready-made SAR image, is a prerequisite. In the process, the computation and desirably the normalization of the SAR processor gain is a task which should not be underestimated, as several processing steps and a multitude of influencing variables has to be considered. In order to satisfactorily solve this task {{in the framework of}} SAR processor development, each processing step has to be analyzed thoroughly whether and by which factor it changes the signal power. Another important characteristic with respect to radiometry is the noise figure in the focused SAR image. Here too, the computation of the processor gain is a major issue. However, echo signal and the receiver noise, the latter might be evaluated on base of so-called noise pulse recorded before and after the actual datatake, differ in their spectral shape. Therefore the effect of a signal processing step on both, signal and noise, is in general different and has to be analyzed separately. As the computation of signal and noise gain coincide in their methodology, both aspects shall be jointly discussed in the presentation. Using the example of the Extended Chirp Scaling algorithm which is the basis for the TerraSAR-X Multimode SAR Processor (TMSP), the attention shall be turned to which kinds of processing steps might affect signal and noise gain and how to quantify the effect. A fundamental design decision is whether a SAR processor shall be power or energy normalized. The former has the advantage that brightness and saturation degree of the SAR image do not depend on the pixel spacing in azimuth and range. The squared amplitude of a pixel corresponds to the radar backscatter coefficient. The distinction between power and energy normalization gains relevance for processing steps like spectral zero padding which originally keeps the signal energy but not the power. Here, power normalization necessitates an adequate amplification of the signal. During the range pre-compression step the recorded echo signal is correlated by the complex conjugate signal of a chirp pulse replica. Therefore, the squared chirp pulse energy occurs in the filtered signal because the energy originates once from the transmitted radar pulse and once from the used replica. Accordingly, the signal amplitude has to be attenuated by the integral of the squared amplitude of the chirp (i. e. the chirp energy). Band-pass filters are one potential source for differences between signal and noise gain provided that the bandwidth of the echo signal and of the noise pulses that estimate the receiver noise are different. In this case the band-pass filter removes different portions of power from signal and noise. Another processing step which influences the spectral shape of signal and noise is the azimuth antenna pattern removal which equalizes the SAR echoes along the aperture and intentionally leads to an almost rectangular spectrum of the band limited echo signal. In contrast, no antenna pattern originally occurred in the noise signal so that exactly this processing step impresses the reciprocal antenna pattern to the noise spectrum, amplifying the edges of the spectrum. Once a colored noise spectrum resulted, its spectral shape has to be considered in the processing gain analysis of all subsequent processing steps. In particular, this refers to spectral weighting (e. g. by a Hamming window). A normalization of the applied window function w. r. t. a rectangular spectrum is adequate for the SAR signal. In contrast, the noise gain results as weighted average of the window function, where the weighting function is the spectrum of the colored noise. Due to the importance of the SAR processor for the overall SAR system calibration, a correct normalization is indispensable. It is <b>required</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> days of the mission...|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{which allows the}} sequential fast analysis of heart-cuts taken during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> column elution of an essential oil sample in a multidimensional gas chromatography experiment. In this investigation, a relatively short, narrow bore capillary column {{is used in the}} second dimension, with fast cryogenic modulation permitting rapid delivery of cryofocussed heart-cuts into the second column of the multidimensional arrangement. In this implementation, the total analysis time on the second column is of the order of 30 s, which is less than the duration of the sampled heart-cuts (1 min), with peak theoretical efficiencies of about 7000 m(- 1). Thus, the method should allow on-line heart-cutting of as many discrete heart-cuts as one may <b>require</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> dimension chromatogram, and so two-dimensional separation can be achieved for almost the whole sample in one single analysis without the need for repeat injections or cycling of the oven temperature. The method is demonstrated by the transfer and rapid re-injection of I min heart-cuts taken from an initial separation stage of peppermint essential oil. The cryofocussing and fast analysis step is shown to increase signal response by up to 40 -fold. Total peak capacity in the described system is measured to be of the order of 1800, with capacities of about 20 - 30 for each 30 s second dimension analysis. By increasing the frequency of sampling to remove excessive (unused) time to develop the 2 D separation, {{it should be possible to}} achieve peak capacities of 5000 or more baseline resolved peaks...|$|R
