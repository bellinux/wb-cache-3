5|$|The front entry {{leads into}} the living room where {{polished}} wood is found throughout as well as 19th century furnishings. The front room is part of the original building which consisted of one room. The room acted as the Deere's kitchen, living room, bedrooms, essentially everything. Deere eventually added onto the house, including a bedroom and an upstairs loft. The first floor bedroom would have been used for John and his wife, and possibly a couple of the children while the upstairs <b>room</b> <b>would</b> was used {{for the rest of the}} children. The Deeres left the home in 1847 when they moved to Moline, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The {{spacecraft}} {{in which}} the telescope and instruments were to be housed was another major engineering challenge. It would have to withstand frequent passages from direct sunlight {{into the darkness of}} Earth's shadow, which would cause major changes in temperature, while being stable enough to allow extremely accurate pointing of the telescope. A shroud of multi-layer insulation keeps the temperature within the telescope stable and surrounds a light aluminum shell {{in which the}} telescope and instruments sit. Within the shell, a graphite-epoxy frame keeps the working parts of the telescope firmly aligned. Because graphite composites are hygroscopic, there was a risk that water vapor absorbed by the truss while in Lockheed's clean <b>room</b> <b>would</b> later be expressed in the vacuum of space; resulting in the telescope's instruments being covered by ice. To reduce that risk, a nitrogen gas purge was performed before launching the telescope into space.|$|E
5|$|The west {{range was}} entirely rebuilt by the Gilmours, in the 1660s, {{to provide a}} spacious suite of modern accommodation, to suit Sir John's {{position}} as a senior judge. The ground floor contained a large central drawing room dining room, with large windows, and a carved stone fireplace. This <b>room</b> <b>would</b> also have had plaster ceilings and other decorative features. To the north was a kitchen, and to the south a chamber, with a wine cellar below. The first floor had four bedrooms. Another new stair was built, connecting the west range with the tower house. The door to this tower has a classical pediment, above which is a 20th-century plaque, erected by a descendant of the Gilmours, and bearing the arms of Sir John Gilmour and his wife. The west range is now roofless, the internal floor is also gone, and the large windows have been blocked up.|$|E

25|$|In a {{multi-story}} building, {{an internal}} stairway (away from broken windows) often {{acts as a}} safe haven, due to the stairs reinforcing the walls and blocking any major debris falling from above. If a stairway is lined with windows, {{then there would be}} the danger of flying glass, so an interior stairway, or small inner <b>room,</b> <b>would</b> be preferable.|$|E
25|$|In particular, Muir did {{not tell}} his deck {{officers}} that as the auxiliary engines had been down for maintenance, the engine <b>room</b> <b>would</b> need to be ordered to have the main engines on standby if a need arose to move the ship. Muir then rejoined his wife in his cabin, leaving Second Officer Donald Allan MacIsaac on watch.|$|E
25|$|In {{the days}} after Cruz {{departed}} no one else volunteered to leave, so Big Brother ran a set of challenges to decide who from the White <b>Room</b> <b>would</b> move to the main house. First, Kara was evicted when Harrison and Demet nominated her. Then, the Big Brother housemates lodged their votes on who they wanted in the house. Demet won the vote and became an official housemate.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2002, Lowe Enterprises {{sold the}} Washington Monarch Hotel to Legacy Hotels Real Estate Investment Trust for $145 million Legacy hired Fairmont Hotels and Resorts {{to manage the}} property, and rebranded the hotel as The Fairmont Washington, D.C. Fairmont said some <b>rooms</b> <b>would</b> be {{converted}} into ultra-luxurious [...] "Fairmont Gold" [...] rooms. Guests in these <b>rooms</b> <b>would</b> receive private check-in, exclusive concierge services, and additional and upgraded amenities. The Fairmont Washington was the first [...] "Fairmont Gold" [...] hotel in the United States.|$|R

25|$|Each {{engine was}} located in a {{separate}} watertight engine compartment. In case of a hull breach in that area, only one engine <b>room</b> <b>would</b> then be flooded, and the ship would still have use of the adjacent engine. In addition to this Lucania had 16 transverse watertight compartments, with watertight doors that could be manually closed on command from the telegraph on the bridge. She could remain afloat with any two compartments flooded.|$|E
25|$|In April 1975, the Van {{received}} a higher roof {{and became a}} four-seater. This was necessitated by Japanese commercial vehicle regulation which require the floor to be completely flat when the rear seat is folded. Because the Rex's engine was mounted in the rear, the cargo floor was rather high, meaning that more head <b>room</b> <b>would</b> be required before a seat could be installed. The Wagon continued in production until the SEEC-T version was introduced in December, but it lost most of its market with {{the availability of a}} four-seater Van.|$|E
25|$|The Hall is the {{principal}} entrance to the house {{which would have been}} used by any eminent guests; entering the house by climbing the double staircase beneath the portico the guest immediately sees, through a gilded doorcase, a short enfilade through the staircase hall to the Octagon drawing room. While the hall in its use was not comparable with the Great Hall of earlier manor houses, it was still more than a mere entrance vestibule; in the 18th century, it was considered than any house of note required three principal reception rooms when entertaining: one for dancing, one for supper and one for cards. Thus, the hall, dining room and Octagon Drawing <b>Room</b> <b>would</b> fulfil those roles.|$|E
50|$|Inspired by {{the culture}} of Thailand, the hotel would have {{featured}} Thai furnishings and cuisine. Architectural plans featured a large center building more than 160 feet tall with a restaurant on top comparable {{to the design of}} Disney's Contemporary Resort. Guest <b>rooms</b> <b>would</b> have been arranged in a square around the perimeter on three sides leaving the side opposite the Seven Seas Lagoon open. The original plan called for 600 rooms but was scaled down to 500 in later revisions. Two-thirds of the guest <b>rooms</b> <b>would</b> have had garden or lake views. Fifty suites would have been deluxe rooms themed after Thai royalty.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2014, Stockton had {{purchased}} the shuttered Showboat Atlantic City hotel and casino for $18 million, {{with plans to}} develop a full-service residential campus awarding undergraduate and graduate degrees and other professional training programs. The former resort, dubbed the [...] "Island Campus", would have been converted casino and employee spaces into classrooms, cafeteria space and offices for faculty and staff. Several floors of hotel <b>rooms</b> <b>would</b> be renovated into student housing, while the remaining <b>rooms</b> <b>would</b> be operated as a hotel. The House of Blues would be modified to house the school's performing arts programs.|$|R

25|$|On 16 February 2001 at Nellis Air Force Base, a Predator {{successfully}} fired three Hellfire AGM-114C missiles into a target. The newly armed Predators {{were given}} the designation of MQ-1A. In {{the first week of}} June 2001, a Hellfire missile was successfully launched on a replica of bin Laden's Afghanistan Tarnak residence built at a Nevada testing site. A missile launched from a Predator exploded inside one of the replica's rooms; it was concluded that any people in the <b>room</b> <b>would</b> have been killed. On 4 September 2001 (after the Bush cabinet approved a Qaeda/Taliban plan), CIA chief Tenet ordered the agency to resume reconnaissance flights. The Predators were now weapons-capable, but didn't carry missiles because the host country (presumably Uzbekistan) hadn't granted permission.|$|E
25|$|By {{creating}} this system, information flow was primarily in one direction, {{and continued to}} be split out on the way down. For instance, the filter room might be receiving 15 reports per minute from various CH sites, but these would be about formations that might cover the entire coast of Great Britain. Portions of these reports, say those over Kent, {{would be sent to}} 11 Group, while others, the attack on RAF Driffield for instance, would only be relayed to 13 Group. In turn, 11 Group's operations <b>room</b> <b>would</b> relay only those tracks of interest down to the sectors, filtering out tracks that were out of their range, or being handled by other sectors. Finally, the sector operators only had to relay information to the pilots that actually had an effect on their flight– data about other formations was not relayed, freeing the radio time.|$|E
25|$|The {{first floor}} {{is where the}} Great Hall with its large vaulted ceiling is situated. The Great Hall was mainly used for grand banquets and {{entertainment}} for the lord and his guests. Guests staying at the castle would have also slept {{on the floor of}} the Great Hall. The Hall also served as a court as the lord would act as a judge passing verdicts and sentences for crimes committed in the surrounding area. The first floor also has a minstrel's gallery where a group of travelling minstrels would play instruments and act for the Lord and Lady sitting below. Off the minstrel's gallery is the minstrels changing room, where the travelling players would change into their bright costumes. This <b>room</b> <b>would</b> also have been used by the minstrels to sleep in; the reason for them having their own private quarters was that it was feared that many of them would have been carrying disease. They slept here to stop them passing any ailments on to other guests. The guard room also sits on the first floor. The guard room has the only access to the dungeon in the castle, a small hole in the floor where prisoners were thrown in. A guard would always be present in this room to both guard the dungeon but also the only entrance to the castle, a small door above ground level, which is next to the guard room.|$|E

25|$|Throughout the house, {{there are}} {{numerous}} love quotes written by Oscar Wilde, William Shakespeare, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In {{the dining room and}} kitchen, the furniture are in bright red and yellow colors, and logs stacked against each other fill up a wall. The walkway to the Head of Household room evokes a giant library. The Head of Household room is an exotic island oasis. The headboard is made from a surfboard, there are Hula girl table lamps, rattan carpet and Polynesian knickknacks. The boat bedroom features shelves and chests designed to resemble small rowboats with rowboat shaped beds. Two large beds made of actual unfinished tree branches with pink bedspreads fill another room. The living room features a giant green semi-circular sofa, and a stone wall fireplace. A red colored room connected directly to the living room by a short hallway, with no doors, has a pair of pullout couches rather than actual beds. New this season is a Spa room complete with a massage table, two-person sauna and lounge. The spa <b>room</b> <b>would</b> be featured in numerous subsequent seasons. Outside, there is a hot tub and pool, a billiards table and lounge area. The lounge area features a fire pit and heated lamps. Along with work-out equipment, there are lawn chairs to lay out in the sun. The outside also includes the washing machine and clothes dryer, both of which are covered overhead.|$|E

500|$|The Sutherland Room lies at {{the rear}} east wing {{of the house and}} was once the bedroom of the Earl of Althorp in the first few centuries of the house when it was fashionable for the {{occupants}} to sleep on the ground floor and guests to sleep on the first floor. This was still the case during the Holland restoration, and as a result the room was ignored, so it retains many of the earlier mouldings not seen in many other parts of the house. It contains two fireplaces made by John Vardy and James Stuart which were originally situated in Spencer House, and the room has the original 17th-century cornice. The paintings in the room were selected by the current owner Charles Spencer to honour John, Third Earl Spencer and his passion for foxhunting. After it ceased usage as a bedroom, on special occasions the <b>room</b> <b>would</b> be full of life; on Christmas Day the <b>room</b> <b>would</b> be [...] "transformed into a Christmas fairyland, with clockwork Santas, snowmen and angels all spinning and chiming in the candlelight".
