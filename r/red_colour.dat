5|$|A colour {{reaction}} for salts of acetic acid is iron(III) chloride solution, {{which results in}} a deeply <b>red</b> <b>colour</b> that disappears after acidification. A more sensitive test uses lanthanum nitrate with iodine and ammonia to give a blue solution. Acetates when heated with arsenic trioxide form cacodyl oxide, which can be detected by its malodorous vapours.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011 Lothian Buses {{introduced}} 60 new {{double deck}} buses. These buses continued {{with the same}} madder red and white pattern {{on the outside of}} the bus but Lothian Buses changed the seats to a matching madder <b>red</b> <b>colour.</b> They also changed the entrance to the bus to a more wooden effect. Routes 4, 5, 19, 23 and 27 were the first buses to receive this branding.|$|E

5|$|The {{exoskeleton}} {{is generally}} blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The <b>red</b> <b>colour</b> associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment astaxanthin {{is bound to}} a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment.|$|E
5|$|The grocery-store chain ICA had {{sponsored}} IFK Göteborg since 1974, {{and their}} logo was {{displayed on the}} chest of the shirt 1980–2010, leading some to consider it {{an integral part of}} the shirt. The ICA logo was reproduced in its original <b>red</b> <b>colour</b> for the first few years, but was then changed to a blue-and-white version to better blend with the kit colours.|$|E

5|$|Mars (1.5AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is smaller than}} Earth and Venus (0.107 Earth masses). It has an {{atmosphere}} of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that of Earth). Its surface, peppered with vast volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. Its <b>red</b> <b>colour</b> comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil. Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be captured asteroids.|$|E
5|$|Motul de San José {{has been}} {{identified}} as the source of Ik-style polychrome ceramics bearing painted scenes of the Late Classic Maya aristocracy involved in a variety of courtly activities. The Ik-style was characterised by hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale <b>red</b> <b>colour,</b> scenes with dancers wearing masks, and the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life. The city was the capital of a polity that included various satellite sites of varying importance, including a port on the shore of Lake Petén Itzá.|$|E
5|$|The Galloway breed {{comes from}} the cattle native to the {{south-west}} region of Scotland, first fully developed in the 17th century. Originally there was much variation within this breed, including many different colours and patterns. The original Galloway herd book only registered black cattle, but the recessive gene for <b>red</b> <b>colour</b> persisted in the population, and eventually dun Galloways were also allowed into the herd book. As a result, although black {{is still the most}} common colour for Galloways, they can also be red and several shades of dun. In 1877 the Galloway Cattle Society was formed.|$|E

5|$|The red-billed chough {{has a long}} {{association}} with Cornwall, and appears on the Cornish coat of arms. According to Cornish legend King Arthur did not die after his last battle but rather his soul migrated {{into the body of}} a red-billed chough, the <b>red</b> <b>colour</b> of its bill and legs being derived from the blood of the last battle and hence killing this bird was unlucky. Legend also holds that after the last Cornish chough departs from Cornwall, then the return of the chough, as happened in 2001, will mark the return of King Arthur.|$|E
5|$|Albrecht the Elder's {{panel is}} {{regarded}} as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing <b>red</b> <b>colour</b> in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.|$|E
5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and {{is comparable to}} other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts come from the thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its <b>red</b> <b>colour</b> and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E

5|$|Phosphorus, {{selenium}} and lead, {{which are}} less often recognised as metalloids, {{are also used}} in glasses. Phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), rather than the silica (SiO2) of conventional silicate glasses. It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a <b>red</b> <b>colour</b> to glass. Decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO. Lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronics components; enamelling; sealing and glazing materials; and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead {{in many of these}} applications.|$|E
5|$|The Ik-style ceramic corpus {{includes}} {{a set of}} features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale <b>red</b> <b>colour</b> and scenes with dancers wearing masks. One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life, {{something that is very}} rare in Mesoamerican art. The corpus is represented by more than 30 intact vessels, the majority of unknown provenance, which have been compared to ceramic fragments recovered from Motul de San José and its satellite sites. The subject matter of the vessels includes courtly life from the Petén region in the 8th century AD, such as diplomatic representations, feasting, bloodletting, scenes of warriors and the sacrifice of prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The main {{harvesting}} {{season for}} coffee in Rwanda is during the major rainy season, running from March {{to the end}} of May. At harvest time, farmers spend most of the day picking cherries by hand. In the evening, they carry them in traditional baskets woven from banana leaves to the washing station, which may be several hours away. Technicians hand-sort the beans to pick out the best cherries, those with a deep <b>red</b> <b>colour,</b> and return the remainder to the grower to be sold on to markets outside the Maraba process at a lower price. The technicians pay the grower US$0.10 per kilogram. This money accumulates, and the association pays it each fortnight into farmers' bank accounts.|$|E

5|$|According to the Parliamentary paper Misc. 5 of 1966, the {{background}} of the ensign is red with the ratio of its width to its length being one by two. In contrast, the ratio of the national flag of Singapore is two by three. In the centre of the ensign is a white ring, which surrounds a crescent and five stars also coloured white. The five stars are arranged such that they form a pentagon in the middle. The crescent and stars are taken from the national flag, although in the ensign the crescent appears underneath rather than {{to the left of the}} stars. According to a 1999 circular National Colours for Singapore Ships issued by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), the <b>red</b> <b>colour</b> of the civil ensign is the same as that of the national flag. The shade of red has been defined by the Ministry of Information, Communications and the Arts as Pantone 032.|$|E
5|$|In April 1921, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi {{wrote in}} his journal Young India {{about the need for}} an Indian flag, proposing a flag with the charkha or {{spinning}} wheel at the centre. The idea of the spinning wheel was put forth by Lala Hansraj, and Gandhi commissioned Pingali Venkayya to design a flag with the spinning wheel on a red and green banner, the <b>red</b> <b>colour</b> signifying Hindus and the green standing for Muslims. Gandhi wanted the flag to be presented at the Congress session of 1921, but it was not delivered on time, and another flag was proposed at the session. Gandhi later wrote that the delay was fortuitous since it allowed him to realise that other religions were not represented; he then added white to the banner colours, to represent all the other religions. Finally, owing to the religious-political sensibilities, in 1929, Gandhi moved towards a more secular interpretation of the flag colours, stating that red stood for the sacrifices of the people, white for purity, and green for hope.|$|E
5|$|The cover art was {{conceived}} by Weymouth and Frantz {{with the help}} of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Walter Bender and his MIT Media Lab team. Using Melody Attack as inspiration, the couple created a collage of red warplanes flying in formation over the Himalayas. The planes are an artistic depiction of Grumman Avenger planes in honour of Weymouth's father, Ralph Weymouth, who was a US Navy Admiral. The idea for the back cover included simple portraits of the band members. Weymouth attended MIT regularly during the summer of 1980 and worked with Bender's colleague, Scott Fisher, on the computer renditions of the ideas. The process was tortuous because computer power was limited in the early 1980s and the mainframe alone took up several rooms. Weymouth and Fisher shared a passion for masks and used the concept to experiment with the portraits. The faces (except for eyes, noses and mouths) were blotted out with blocks of <b>red</b> <b>colour.</b> Weymouth considered superimposing Eno's face on top of all four portraits to insinuate his egotism—the producer wanted to be on the cover art together with TalkingHeads—but decided against it in the end.|$|E
