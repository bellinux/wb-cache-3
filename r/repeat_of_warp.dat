40|$|Basalt fabric composite, with {{different}} twill wave reinforcements, i. e. twill 2 / 2 and twill 1 / 3, {{have been studied}} in this work by means of experimental tests and numerical finite element (FE) simulations. As fabric reinforcements show <b>repeating</b> undulations <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> and fill yarn, simple mixtures law cannot be applied. As a consequence, the mesoscopic scale, lying between the microscopic and the macroscopic one, {{has to be taken}} into account to mechanically characterize a fabric reinforced composite. The aim of this work is to evaluate the stiffness of a fabric reinforced composite in warp and fill direction. In particular a numerical FE model, assuming elliptical sections and sinusoidal shape of the yarns, has been implemented and experimental tests have been carried out in order to validate the proposed model. Finally, the strength and the failure modes of the composite material, for each analysed structure and textile orientation, have been experimentally investigated...|$|R
50|$|The term {{tapestry}} is {{also used}} to describe weft-faced textiles made on Jacquard looms. Before the 1990s tapestry upholstery fabrics and reproductions of the famous tapestries of the Middle Ages had been produced using Jacquard techniques but more recently, artists such as Chuck Close, Patrick Lichty, and the workshop Magnolia Editions have adapted the computerised Jacquard process to producing fine art.Typically, tapestries are translated from the original design via a process resembling paint-by-numbers: a cartoon is divided into regions, each of which is assigned a solid colour based on a standard palette. However, in Jacquard weaving, the <b>repeating</b> series <b>of</b> multicoloured <b>warp</b> and weft threads can be used to create colours that are optically blended - i.e., the human eye apprehends the threads’ combination of values as a single colour.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{determination}} of the geometric structural parameters of a glass textile reinforcement, which is embedded into an epoxy polymer matrix, by micro-computed tomography (CT).

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{statistical}} study <b>of</b> optical <b>warps</b> {{in a sample}} of 540 galaxies, about five times larger than previous samples. About 40 % of all late-type galaxies reveal S-shaped <b>warping</b> <b>of</b> their planes in the outer parts. Given the geometrical parameters and detection sensitivity, this result suggests that at least half of all galaxy disks might be warped. We demonstrate through geometrical simulations that some apparent warps could be due to spiral arms in a highly inclined galaxy. The simulations <b>of</b> non <b>warped</b> galaxies give an amount <b>of</b> false <b>warps</b> <b>of</b> ≈ 15 %, while simulations <b>of</b> <b>warped</b> galaxies suggest that no more than 20 % <b>of</b> the <b>warps</b> are missed.

40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increasing}} number of observational studies have hinted at the presence <b>of</b> <b>warps</b> in protoplanetary discs, however a general comprehensive description of observational diagnostics <b>of</b> <b>warped</b> discs was missing. We performed a series of 3 D SPH hydrodynamic simulations and combined them with 3 D radiative transfer calculations to study the observability <b>of</b> <b>warps</b> in circumbinary discs, whose plane is misaligned with respect to the orbital plane of the central binary. Our numerical hydrodynamic simulations confirm previous analytical results on the dependence <b>of</b> the <b>warp</b> structure on the viscosity and the initial misalignment between the binary and the disc. To study the observational signatures <b>of</b> <b>warps</b> we calculate images in the continuum at near-infrared and sub-millimetre wavelengths and in the pure rotational transition of CO in the sub-millimetre. Warped circumbinary discs show surface brightness asymmetry in near-infrared scattered light images as well as in optically thick gas lines at sub-millimetre wavelengths. The asymmetry is caused by self-shadowing of the disc by the inner warped regions, thus the strength of the asymmetry depends on the strength <b>of</b> the <b>warp.</b> The projected velocity field, derived from line observations, shows characteristic deviations, twists and a change in the slope of the rotation curve, from that of an unperturbed disc. In extreme cases even the direction of rotation appears to change in the disc inwards of a characteristic radius. The strength of the kinematical signatures <b>of</b> <b>warps</b> decreases with increasing inclination. The strength <b>of</b> all <b>warp</b> signatures decreases with decreasing viscosity.

For 	them we tested on {{the relation between the}} heald harness motion and warp tension， and the break <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> 	in weaving. 	Following resultsare obtained. 	(1) The tension <b>of</b> lifted <b>warp</b> is smaller than the tension <b>of</b> depressed <b>warp.</b> 	(2) The variety <b>of</b> depressed <b>warp</b> tension is more sudden than the variety <b>of</b> lifted <b>warp</b> tension. 	(3) The tappet whose dwell of small radius is 0 °，moves　most smoothly and keeps the most smooth variety 	to the warp tension. 	(4) The tappet whose dwell is small，reduce sboth the warp tension and the variety <b>of</b> <b>warp</b> tension. But 	when the loom moves at h 1 gh speed，the upper side of shuttle touches the warp and consequently the breaks 	<b>of</b> <b>warp</b> are increaed.
