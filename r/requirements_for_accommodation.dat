40|$|Because of {{the urgent}} need to reduce the space <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>accommodation</b> of the paper search files the German Patent Office has {{developed}} EMIR, a computer-aided search system using roll microfilm as storage medium. Prior art searching with EMIR has some advantages over manual searching in classified search files 1, 2. At present about 300 000 patent documents (AT, CH, FR, GB, US) published before 1950 have been filmed on 500 roll microfilms (16 mm) mounted in 3 M- cartridges. With {{the help of a}} special retrieval software and disks containing the bibliographical data [...] one disk per microfilm [...] this collection can be searched at three retrieval stations (one personal computer and one microfilm (MF) reader per station). Each rollfilm contains about 2500 document pages. The retrieval program written in BASIC enables dialog searching in the stored material according to document country, document number, IPC-unit range, publication interval and keywords. ...|$|E

Every subset of object or attribute set will be evaluated from concept lattice of corresponding external formal context. The paper provides a method how to compute such second order formal concepts by using of bonds between external formal contexts or by using of heterogeneous formal contexts methods. Last {{part of the}} paper shows how this structure generalizes homogenic fuzzy formal context and its derivation operators. 1 Motivation example Imagine the following situation as a motivation. Lets {{have a group of}} people that everybody knows each other (schoolmates, co-workers, etc.). All {{of them are going to}} travel somewhere together and you (as an organizer of the trip) would like to know their <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>accommodation.</b> Consider the following formal context. Set of objects represents a group of co-workers (Anna, Bob, Cyril, David, Erik). Set of attributes expresses their requirements (TV, Wellness, Closeness to a city center, Restaurant in a hotel).

40|$|An {{electric}} field acts upon a dielectric medium {{by means of}} three different body forces, capable of dramatically influencing its dynamics. In a single-phase fluid, under d. c. fields, the Coulomb force, which needs free charge, outclasses the other forces of electric nature. The physico-chemical origin of this charge, of ionic kind, and its interaction with the surrounding neutral molecules have been analyzed for the ion injection phenomenon, initially from a theoretical standpoint. Then, experiments intending to determine {{the effectiveness of the}} electrohydrodynamic process in terms of heat transfer enhancement have been conducted under five major convective regimes: (i) free advection on an upward and (ii) a downward heated plate, (iii) forced convection in a square channel, heated from one side, and (iv) mixed convection in a uniformly heated annular duct, with vertical ascending and (v) with horizontal flow. The high-voltage electrodes, tested at both polarities, are points made of several materials, manufactured by means of different techniques. Comparisons among fluids of technological relevance have been carried out, obtaining in all cases remarkable augmentation of convective heat transfer, with a negligible energy input. An important thermo-fluid dynamical analogy between electrically-induced jets and classical submerged jets, impinging on the heat transfer surface, has been highlighted. An optimal combination of working fluid and electrode configuration for an internal flow has been selected. Among the numerous applications of the electrohydrodynamic techniques, one has been chosen: a heat sink for thermal control of space components. A design solution for a cold plate has been proposed, giving a much higher performance of what is presently available for the industry and respecting the <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>accommodation</b> on the International Space Station...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the approach taken {{to building a}} low-cost, modular spacecraft bus {{that can be used}} to support a variety of technology experiments in different space environments. It describes the techniques used and design drivers considered to ensure experiment independence from as yet selected host spacecraft. It describes the technology experiment carriers that will support NASA's Living With a Star Space Environment Testbed space missions. NASA has initiated the Living With a Star (LWS) Program to develop a better scientific understanding to address the aspects of the connected Sun-Earth system that affect life and society. A principal goal of the program is to bridge the gap between science, engineering, and user application communities. The Space Environment Testbed (SET) Project is one element of LWS. The Project will enable future science, operational, and commercial objectives in space and atmospheric environments by improving engineering approaches to the accommodation and/or mitigation of the effects of solar variability on technological systems. The SET Project is highly budget constrained and must seek to take advantage of as yet undetermined partnering opportunities for access to space. SET will conduct technology validation experiments hosted on available flight opportunities. The SET Testbeds will be developed in a manner that minimizes the <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> <b>accommodation,</b> and will be flown as flight opportunities become available. To access the widest range of flight opportunities, two key development requirements are to maintain flexibility with respect to accommodation constraints and to have the capability to respond quickly to flight opportunities. Experiments, already developed to the technology readiness level of needing flight validation in the variable Sun-Earth environment, will be selected on the basis of the need for the subject technology, readiness for flight, need for flight resources and particular orbit. Experiments will be accumulated by the Project and manifested for specific flight opportunities as they become available. The SET Carrier is designed to present a standard set of interfaces to SET technology experiments and to be modular and flexible enough to interface to a variety of possible host spacecraft. The Carrier will have core components and mission unique components. Once the core carrier elements have been developed, only the mission unique components need to be defined and developed for any particular mission. This approach will minimize the mission specific cost and development schedule for a given flight opportunity. The standard set of interfaces provided by SET to experiments allows them to be developed independent of the particulars of a host spacecraft. The Carrier will provide the power, communication, and the necessary monitoring features to operate experiments. The Carrier will also provide all of the mechanical assemblies and harnesses required to adapt experiments to a particular host. Experiments may be hosted locally with the Carrier or remotely on the host spacecraft. The Carrier design will allow a single Carrier to support a variable number of experiments and will include features that support the ability to incrementally add experiments without disturbing the core architecture...|$|E

40|$|Following {{the human}} tragedies in {{football}} stadia in Great Britain, several safety legislative requirements {{have been passed}} to ensure spectator safety. Among such requirements is the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> seated <b>accommodation</b> <b>for</b> all spectators. Since the introduction of this requirement, there is however growing concern over the prolonged standing of spectators in seated areas as seated accommodation are not designated for standing and could thus poses risk {{to the safety of}} spectators. This study therefore investigated how spectator standing in seated accommodation affects the safety of spectators, and why spectators stand in seated accommodation by the use of semi-structured interviews. The interview participants included football club safety managers, a safety officer responsible for issuing safety licences at designated grounds and a spectator. The study indicates that the safety risk posed by spectator standing in seated areas include a spectator falling over a seat or guard rail and the obstruction of access for emergency services. The study further indicates that spectator standing is influenced by factors such as the fixture of the game, moments of excitement, spectator comfort, and the atmosphere of the crowd. The findings of the study provide valuable insight to stimulate proactive thinking towards implementing measures in relation to football stadia design and management to ensure safety...|$|R
40|$|As {{with many}} other disciplines, the study of {{medicine}} is being influenced by {{the change in the}} cultural make-up of our country. On occasion, conflicts may develop between the personal beliefs of medical students and the training they must undertake in order to become competent and caring physicians. What are the implications for medical school training in terms of the increasing diversity of the individuals applying to, and being accepted into, medical schools across this country? How much should we allow the personal beliefs and values of physicians-in-training to modify the medical education experience as it currently exists? Do we need to accommodate these individual student differences (religious and cultural) when designing and modifying the medical school curriculum? This thesis looks at the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>accommodation</b> (as established in human rights legislation) and the rights of individuals entering into medical school training (as guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms) and attempts to balance these individual rights against the goal of a medical school to develop a generic physician who is prepared, at completion of medical school training, to enter into many different post-graduate training programs. Medical school training involves a number of different types of learning including: knowledge acquisition, procedural competence, and the ability to interact in an intimate, yet wholly professional, manner with complete strangers. Current accreditation requirements demand that each medical student achieves a requisite level of knowledge, and the ability to perform certain physical examinations and associated procedures, by the completion of medical school training. Three distinct examples of possible requests <b>for</b> <b>accommodation</b> are examined during this thesis in order to determine if, and when, accommodation is reasonable and achievable. Although it is possible to allow some degree of modification of the medical school training process in order to accommodate religious or cultural beliefs of particular students, this accommodation is currently not possible if bona fide educational requirements are undermined during this accommodation or if accommodation of students would require undue hardship {{on the part of the}} particular medical school, staff or other students involved in the training process. Creating a standard process whereby students can request a modification of their involvement in the medical school curriculum (in order to accommodate religious or cultural differences) will facilitate unbiased and reasonable decision-making. This will allow students and faculty to have reasonable expectations about the ability of each individual to be successfully integrated into the medical school training program. It would also be useful and responsible to make it clear to students applying to be admitted to medical school where the limits are with respect to what degree of modification of medical school training is possible. The knowledge and clinical abilities that a student will be expected to master, within a Canadian medical school curriculum, must be consistent with the expectation of non-discrimination, as identified by provincial and national human rights legislation, and with the rights and freedoms as guaranteed by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} provide an {{overview}} of how requirements and unmet needs for disability-related aids, devices and human supports changed between 2001 and 2006 using results from Statistics Canada’s Participation and Activity Limitations Surveys. It will illustrate the usefulness of applying a social/cultural model of disability in developing our understanding as to why these changes have taken place. In particular it will show strong relationships between: · Advances in the inclusion of people with disabilities and related changes in both requirements and unmet need. For example, the period saw tightening of the labour market and a commensurate shift of a significant number of non-senior adults with disabilities into employment. Paralleling this shift were increases in both the needs and unmet <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> work-related <b>accommodations.</b> · Acceptance of innovations in design and technology and changes in perceptions of both requirements and unmet needs. For example, there had been marked increases in both the use and unmet need for computer-based supports for people with learning/developmental impairments. The paper will also illustrate the mitigating effects of socio-demographic changes in the population of people with disabilities on requirements and unmet needs. Thus evidence from PALS indicates that increasing access to educational opportunities has translated into significant increases in levels of educational attainment and employment levels among younger people with disabilities, which in turn have affected accommodation requirements. At the same time, there is evidence that considerable increases in age-related impairments commensurate with our graying population have resulted in significant increases in the need <b>for</b> <b>accommodation</b> and acceptance of those adapting to their impairments through their use.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the views of adults with disabilities and their care {{providers}} with regard to extent to which health promotion implementation was facilitated within Protective Workshops across several service areas in South Africa. Quantitative and Qualitative Data was collected via a combination of data collection approaches that included the use of a descriptive survey, a self-administered questionnaire and a semi-structured interview. Structured questionnaires and an interview schedule were used to generate data from both the patient and care provider participants in each of the selected facilities. Participants with disabilities and care providers working in the Protective Workshops were identified and sampled through a multi-stage sampling procedure. Participants from 48 facilities participated in the study. The findings revealed that health promotion in Protective Workshops was cursory and informal. Even though health education was provided whenever the need arose, it was neither individualized nor customized in accordance with reasonable accommodation of people with disabilities. There were provincial differences in terms of the levels of participation and organizational support for people with disabilities. In certain cases bureaucratic obstacles were identified during field work. Results show inconsistency regarding access to equal opportunities for people with disabilities, albeit some agreed to a lesser extent (30. 5 %), others moderately (21. 5 %) compared to only 22. 6 % who agreed, were exceeded by 25 % of respondents who completely disagreed to the notion that equal opportunities existed for people with disabilities. The latter was confirmed by care providers. The study recommended an urgent need for the development of inclusive health promotion, the enforcement of the <b>requirements</b> <b>for</b> reasonable <b>accommodation</b> and adherence to policy and legal imperatives.
