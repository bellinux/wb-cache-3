40|$|Interruptible <b>rendering</b> {{is a novel}} {{approach}} to the fidelity-versusperformance tradeoff ubiquitous in real-time <b>rendering.</b> Interruptible <b>rendering</b> unifies spatial error caused by <b>rendering</b> coarse approximations for speed and temporal error caused by the delay imposed by <b>rendering</b> into a single image-space error measure. The heart {{of this approach is}} a progressive <b>rendering</b> framework that <b>renders</b> a coarse image into the back buffer and continuously refines it while monitoring temporal error. When temporal error exceeds the spatial error caused by coarse <b>rendering,</b> further refinement is pointless, and the image is displayed. We discuss how to adapt different <b>rendering</b> algorithms for interruptible use and present implementations based on polygonal <b>rendering</b> and ray casting. Interruptible <b>rendering</b> provides a low-latency, self-tuning {{approach to}} interactive <b>rendering.</b> To evaluate our results we introduce a “gold standard” approach that measures dynamic visual error against a hypothetical perfect <b>rendering</b> and show that interruptible <b>rendering</b> is more accurate than standard fidelity-versusperformance schemes. This improved accuracy enables better interactive <b>rendering,</b> both for complex models and complex <b>rendering</b> modalities such as ray casting...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – We {{describe}} the software architecture of a <b>rendering</b> system that follows a pragmatic approach to integrating and bundling {{the power of}} different lowlevel <b>rendering</b> systems within an object-oriented framework. The generic <b>rendering</b> system provides higher-level abstractions to existing <b>rendering</b> systems {{and serves as a}} framework for developing new <b>rendering</b> techniques. It wraps the functionality of several, widely used <b>rendering</b> systems, defines a unified, object-oriented application programming interface, and provides an extensible, customizable apparatus for evaluating and interpreting hierarchical scene information. As a fundamental property, individual features of a specific <b>rendering</b> system can be integrated into the generic <b>rendering</b> system in a transparent way. The system is based on a state machine, called engine, which operates on <b>rendering</b> components. Four major categories of <b>rendering</b> components constitute the generic <b>rendering</b> system: shapes represent geometries; attributes specify properties assigned to geometries and scenes; handlers encapsulate <b>rendering</b> algorithms, and techniques represent evaluation strategies for <b>rendering</b> components. As a proof of concept, we have implemented the described software architecture by the Virtual <b>Rendering</b> System which currently wraps OpenGL...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a 3 D <b>rendering</b> meta system which wraps the functionality of 3 D <b>rendering</b> packages into a uniform, object-oriented framework. The homogeneous interface of the 3 D <b>rendering</b> meta system serves as an easy-to-learn application programming interface to 3 D <b>rendering</b> packages and allows us to exchange <b>rendering</b> packages without the need to recode an application. Our approach is based on a logical decomposition of the elements of 3 D <b>rendering</b> into four major class categories: Shapes define geometric objects; attributes specify quality and visual appearance; controllers describe <b>rendering</b> techniques and <b>rendering</b> processes, and <b>rendering</b> engines evaluate shapes, attributes, and controllers. We have implemented our concepts in VRS, the Virtual <b>Rendering</b> System, as a portable C++ toolkit.

40|$|ParaView is {{a popular}} {{open-source}} general-purpose scientific visualization application. One of the many visualization tools available within ParaView is the volume <b>rendering</b> of unstructured meshes. Volume <b>rendering</b> is a technique that <b>renders</b> a mesh as a translucent solid, thereby allowing the user to see every point in three-dimensional space simultaneously. Because volume <b>rendering</b> is computationally intensive, ParaView now employs a unique parallel <b>rendering</b> algorithm to speed the processes. The parallel <b>rendering</b> algorithm is very flexible. It works equally well for both volumes and surfaces, and can properly <b>render</b> the intersection of a volume and opaque polygonal surfaces. The parallel <b>rendering</b> algorithm can also <b>render</b> images for tiled displays. In this paper, we explore the implementation of parallel unstructured volume <b>rendering</b> in ParaView...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we {{survey the}} {{techniques}} for image-based <b>rendering.</b> Unlike traditional 3 D computer graphics in which 3 D {{geometry of the}} scene is known, image-based <b>rendering</b> techniques <b>render</b> novel views directly from input images. Previous image-based <b>rendering</b> techniques can be classified into three categories according to how much geometric information is used: <b>rendering</b> without geometry, <b>rendering</b> with implicit geometry (i. e., correspondence), and <b>rendering</b> with explicit geometry (either with approximate or accurate geometry). We discuss the characteristics of these categories and their representative methods. The continuum between images and geometry used in image-based <b>rendering</b> techniques suggests that image-based <b>rendering</b> with traditional 3 D graphics can be united in a joint image and geometry space.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{contribute}} to our knowledge of what haptics can {{bring to the table}} as a human-computer interface <b>rendering</b> technique, which other <b>rendering</b> techniques cannot. An experiment was set up in which a multi-interfaced game was used to convey an information structure to interface users. Each of the game’s three user interfaces utilized one of three different <b>rendering</b> techniques: haptic <b>rendering,</b> graphic <b>rendering,</b> and graphic-haptic <b>rendering.</b> The capacity of each <b>rendering</b> technique to represent the information structure was assessed in terms of the effect of the corresponding interface on three aspects of the user interaction: user performance, user satisfaction and system usability. The result indicated that user performance benefitted from a graphic or graphic-haptic <b>rendering</b> over a haptic <b>rendering.</b> There were no differences between the <b>rendering</b> techniques with regards to the overall user satisfaction. However, there were notable differences on the user satisfaction metric subscale level. The haptic <b>rendering</b> required higher attentive effort than other renderings. Also, the graphic <b>rendering</b> better facilitated the perception of having clear goals and feedback. The results also suggested that the overall system usability benefitted from a graphic or graphic-haptic <b>rendering</b> over a haptic <b>rendering...</b>|$|R
