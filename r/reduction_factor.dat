2500|$|The perfect modus and maximodus became rare in {{practice}} after the 14th century. Of most practical importance were the subdivisions from the breve downwards, as {{by that time}} the semibreves rather than the breves had taken over the function of the basic counting unit. The four possible combinations of tempus and prolatio could be signaled by a set of mensuration signs {{at the beginning of a}} composition: a circle for tempus perfectum, a semicircle for tempus imperfectum, each combined with a dot for prolatio maior, or no dot for prolatio minor. These correspond to modern measures of , , , and [...] respectively (assuming a <b>reduction</b> <b>factor</b> of 1:4 in transcription, i.e., mapping mensural minims to modern quavers), or alternatively , , [...] and [...] respectively (with a <b>reduction</b> <b>factor</b> of 1:2). In each case, one breve corresponds to one modern bar. In addition, each of these basic patterns had a diminished (diminutum) variant, indicated by a vertical stroke through the sign ( [...] , , , [...] ).

40|$|As near-fault pulse-like strong ground motions {{have severe}} damage {{potential}} for the structures, it is significant to study the effect on strength <b>reduction</b> <b>factors.</b> The recent earthquakes in Taiwan (September 20, 1999, Chi-Chi) have significantly increased the amount of data available in the near-fault. With the near-fault pulse-like ground motions recorded in Chi-Chi earthquake, the near-fault pulse-like effect on strength <b>reduction</b> <b>factors</b> is investigated and the fitting expressions of modifying the strength <b>reduction</b> <b>factors</b> for near-fault effect are presented. It is concluded that during the short or medium period range the strength <b>reduction</b> <b>factors</b> given from the near-fault pulse-like ground motions are significantly less than those from the far-fault ground motions and it is unsafe for using most of the existing strength <b>reduction</b> <b>factors</b> in near-fault areas, {{because most of the}} existing strength <b>reduction</b> <b>factors</b> are obtained from the far-fault ground motions. The conclusions can provide valuable insights to practice and development of seismic code...|$|R
2500|$|In general, {{the result}} of an orbital {{operator}} acting on vibronic states can be replaced by an effective orbital operator acting on purely electronic states. In first order, the effective orbital operator equals the actual orbital operator multiplied by a constant, whose value is less than one, known as a first-order (Ham) <b>reduction</b> <b>factor.</b> For example, within a triplet T1 electronic state, the spin-orbit coupling operator [...] can be replaced by , where [...] {{is a function of the}} strength of the JT coupling which varies from 1 in zero coupling to 0 in very strong coupling. Furthermore, when second-order perturbation corrections are included, additional terms are introduced involving additional numerical factors, known as second-order (Ham) reduction factors. These factors are zero when there is no JT coupling but can dominate over first-order terms in strong coupling, when the first-order effects have been significantly reduced.|$|E

He concluded that the weights required were proportional to the lengths of the sides on which they rested assuming the third side was horizontal and {{that the effect of}} a weight was reduced in a similar manner. It's implicit that the <b>reduction</b> <b>factor</b> is the height of the triangle divided by the side (the sine of the angle of the side with respect to the horizontal). Stevin also made contributions to trigonometry. His book, De Driehouckhandel, included Plane Trigonometry. [...] The proof diagram of this concept is known as the [...] "Epitaph of Stevinus".

40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{developed}} for the description and calculation of Ham <b>reduction</b> <b>factors</b> in 'Jahn-Teller active' systems which are weakly coupled to many lattice modes. Diagrammatic many-body perturbation theory for finite temperatures is combined with diagrammatic group theory into a coherent formalism, whose essential features are readily visualized. The method lends itself to economical calculation of <b>reduction</b> <b>factors</b> (given the recent availability of 6 j symbols for crystal point group) and also to generalization of the traditional single multiplet 'Jahn-Teller problem'. Multimode effects may be distinguished experimentally by searching for particular combinations of <b>reduction</b> <b>factors,</b> associated with particular Feynman diagrams, that vanish to all orders in systems with a continuous symmetry group and to fourth order in all systems, within a single-mode coupling model. General expressions for <b>reduction</b> <b>factors</b> are derived for octahedral systems up to at least fourth order, and including lattice anharmonicity and non-linear electron-phonon coupling. The effects of symmetric vibrations and intermultiplet coupling on <b>reduction</b> <b>factors,</b> and generalization to second order <b>reduction</b> <b>factors,</b> are investigated...|$|R

Soil structure interacting systems are modeled with effective period, effective damping and effective ductility values differing from fixed-base case. For inelastic time history analyses, Newmark method for {{step by step}} time integration was adapted in an in-house computer program. Results are compared with those calculated for fixed-base case.

The influence of several factors was assessed, namely nominal strength {{and type of}} geosynthetic, soil, compaction energy and method used to induce installation damage. Visual observations using a scanning electron microscope were performed. From the data collected, <b>reduction</b> <b>factors</b> for installation damage were derived using tensile strength values (traditional approach) and stiffness modulus (for 2 % strain). Relative to the stiffness approach, the results obtained indicate that the traditional approach can be conservative. The <b>reduction</b> <b>factors,</b> determined using the traditional approach, were also compared with interval estimates from the literature. To contribute to supporting a shift from a factor of safety approach to a limit state design, bias statistics to correct the deterministic predictions were determined from the results. Different correlations were also established to enable using these results to interpolate <b>reduction</b> <b>factors</b> for similar installation conditions and/or geosynthetics from the same family of products.
