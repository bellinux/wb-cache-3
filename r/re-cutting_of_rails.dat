Donner completed about 60% of the shooting of the sequel during the shooting of the first one but was fired from the project.

40|$|Rail track {{undergoes}} complex loading patterns under {{moving traffic}} conditions compared to roads {{due to its}} continued and discontinued multi-layered structure, including rail, sleepers, ballast layer, sub-ballast layer, and subgrade. Particle size distributions (PSDs) of ballast, subballast, and subgrade layers can be critical in cyclic plastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track under moving traffic on frequent track degradation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> tracks, especially at bridge transition zones. Conventional test approaches: static shear and cyclic single-point load tests are however unable to replicate actual loading patterns of moving train. Multi-ring shear apparatus; {{a new type of}} torsional simple shear apparatus, which can reproduce moving traffic conditions, was used in this study to investigate influence of particle size distribution <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track layers on cyclic plastic deformation. Three particle size distributions, using glass beads were examined under different loading patterns: cyclic sin-gle-point load, and cyclic moving wheel load to evaluate cyclic plastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track under different loading methods. The results of these tests suggest that particle size distributions <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track structural layers have significant impacts on cyclic plastic deformation under moving train load. Further, the limitations in con-ventional test methods used in laboratories to estimate the plastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> track materials lead to underestimate the plastic deformation <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> tracks...|$|R
