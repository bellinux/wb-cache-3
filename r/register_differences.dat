In {{spite of a}} great popular success with the role, for which she had {{prepared}} meticulously, Ponselle received a drubbing {{from most of the}} New York critics, especially Olin Downes in the New York Times, whose savagely caustic review hurt Ponselle deeply. The only roles Ponselle sang during her last two seasons at the Met were Santuzza and Carmen, roles that did not tax her upper <b>register.</b> <b>Differences</b> with the Met management regarding repertoire led her not to renew her contract with the company for the 1937/38 season.

5000|$|To some scholars, this {{suggests}} {{the form of}} Vulgar Latin that evolved into the Romance languages was around {{during the time of}} the Roman Empire (from the end of the first century BC), and was spoken alongside the written Classical Latin which was reserved for official and formal occasions. Other scholars argue that the distinctions are more rightly viewed as indicative of sociolinguistic and <b>register</b> <b>differences</b> normally found within any language. Both were mutually intelligible as one and the same language, which was true until very approximately the second half of the 7th century. However, within two hundred years Latin became a dead language since [...] "the Romanized people of Europe could no longer understand texts that were read aloud or recited to them," [...] i.e. Latin had ceased to be a first language and became a foreign language that had to be learned, if the label Latin is constrained to refer to a state of the language frozen in past time and restricted to linguistic features for the most part typical of higher registers.|$|E

Broadly speaking, spatial redundancy is reduced by <b>registering</b> <b>differences</b> between parts of a single frame; this task is known as intraframe compression and {{is closely related to}} image compression. Likewise, temporal redundancy can be reduced by <b>registering</b> <b>differences</b> between frames; this task is known as interframe compression, including motion compensation and other techniques.

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that SR is most {{beneficial}} for significantly undersampled imaging systems where aliasing is present. For such an imaging system, the individual LR observed frames may not compress well because of high spatial frequency content.

Thus, we also consider compression of <b>registered</b> <b>difference</b> frames, as described in the following sub-section.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{explores the}} {{distributional}} and acquisitional characteristics of formulaic sequences in typically multi-modal textbooks most popularly used in English teaching in China. Research {{results indicate that}} the frequency of formulaic sequences in the listening-speaking textbook is significantly higher than that of the reading-writing textbook. Furthermore, the two different modal textbooks differ in both the categories and the functions of formulaic sequences. However, Chinese English learners are generally not sensitive to these differences. In addition, there exists a plateau effect in their acquisition of textbook formulaic sequences, as there is no significant difference between learners of different proficiency levels. These findings reveal the significance of highlighting <b>register</b> <b>differences</b> between reading-writing and listening-speaking, thus shedding light on the input and output problems in college English teaching and learning.

The dictionary data only partially confirmed regional differences between take and have, while the corpora showed a growing use of the light verb have, with Australian and New Zealand English leading the way. The corpora also demonstrated more frequent and more productive use of the construction in spoken than in written data, which allowed conclusions to be drawn about the interpersonal functions of light verbs. 17 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Multi-Dimensional Analysis (MDA) {{has been}} widely used to explore {{register}} variation. This paper reports on a project using MDA to explore the features of an interdisciplinary academic domain. Six dimensions of variation are identified in a corpus of 11, 000 journal articles in environmental studies. We then focus on articles in one interdisciplinary journal, Global Environmental Change (GEC). It is expected that they will diverge sufficiently to produce differences that are analogous to <b>register</b> <b>differences.</b> Instead of identifying these “registers” on external criteria, we use the dimensional profiles of individual texts to identify ‘constellations’ of texts sharing combinations of features. Six such constellations are derived, consisting of texts with commonalities in their approaches to research: the development of predictive models; quantitative research; discussions of theory and policy; and human-environment studies focusing on individual voices. The identification of these constellations {{could not have been}} achieved through an a priori categorisation of texts...|$|E

Furthermore, the uniformity of objects in the images and the type of difference appear to affect seeing and sensing differently, suggesting that these processes are dissociated.

40|$|Abstract This Bachelor’s thesis {{describes}} a survey aimed at exploring first-year university students’ views and perspectives on how their previous education and extra-curricular experiences have prepared them for studying academic English. The students’ comments were analysed from a constructivist perspective, considering how learners experience and conceptualize language, {{with a focus}} on how they distinguish context-specific registers of English. Their responses suggest that the average first-year student has received little explicit instruction in formal <b>register</b> <b>differences</b> prior to university studies, and that their register awareness tends to rely on intuitive, implicit knowledge developed independently outside the explicit instruction of the classroom. Most students experience predominantly colloquial and neutral register forms prior to the university, and a majority expressed having difficulty with the highly technical and formal language of their university lectures and writing assignments. On average, they feel that their preparation has been adequate for the task, but more explicit instruction and feedback would improve their overall learning experience...|$|E

In addition, two categories not present in the Framework but characteristic of business language were also recognized as important by the authors of the textbooks and presented in the task sections. These are some frequently used abbreviations and definitions (or their approximations considering the communicative language competence acquired) that learners can use to fill lexical gaps...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{summarizes}} corpus-based research on linguistic characteristics from several different structural evels, in English {{as well as}} other languages, howing that register variation is inherent in natural language. Itfurther argues that, due to the importance and systematicity of the linguistic differences among registers, diversified corpora representing a broad range of register variation are required as the basis for general language studies. First, the extent of cross-register differences are illustrated from consideration ofindividual grammatical nd lexical features; these <b>register</b> <b>differences</b> are also important for probabilistic part-of-speech taggers and syntactic parsers, because the probabilities associated with grammat-ically ambiguous forms are often markedly different across registers. Then, corpus-based multi-dimensional nalyses of English are summarized, showing that linguistic features from several structural evels function together as underlying dimensions of variation, with each dimension defining a different set of linguistic relations among registers. Finally, the paper discusses how such analyses, based on register-diversified corpora, can be used to address two current issues in computational linguistics: the automatic lassification of texts into register categories and cross-linguistic comparisons of register variation. 1...|$|E

This paper aims to add to this trend by conducting a bottom-up analysis of the speech of twelve participants to the Dutch reality TV show "Expeditie Robinson" (known as “Survivor ” in the Anglo-Saxon world). Based on manual transcriptions of three seasons of the show (35 hours of recordings), we build quantitative profiles tracking each participant's use of two features of Colloquial Belgian Dutch (an informal, substandard but supraregional variety of Dutch). The first feature, word-final t-deletion, is located {{below the level of}} awareness (e. g. nie(t) 'not'), the second feature concerns the use of the personal pronoun gij instead of jij ('you') and can be seen as located above the level of awareness.
