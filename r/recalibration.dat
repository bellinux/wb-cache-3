5|$|After the metre was redefined in 1960, the {{kilogram}} {{remained the}} only SI base unit that {{relied on a}} specific physical artefact, the international prototype of the kilogram (IPK), for its definition and thus the only unit that was still subject to periodic comparisons of national standard kilograms with the IPK. After the 1996–1998 <b>recalibration,</b> a clear divergence between the various prototype kilograms was observed.|$|E
5|$|International Bureau of Weights and Measures (Bureau {{international}} des poids et mesures or BIPM) – {{an international}} metrology centre at Sèvres in France that has {{custody of the}} International prototype kilogram, provides metrology services for the CGPM and CIPM, houses the secretariat for these organisations and hosts their formal meetings.

40|$|Drift is an {{important}} issue that impairs the reliability of gas sensing systems. Sensor aging, memory effects and environmental disturbances produce shifts in sensor responses that make initial statistical models for gas or odor recognition useless after a relatively short period (typically few weeks). Frequent <b>recalibrations</b> are needed to preserve system accuracy. However, when <b>recalibrations</b> involve numerous samples they become expensive and laborious. An interesting and lower cost alternative is drift counteraction by signal processing techniques. Orthogonal Signal Correction (OSC) is proposed for drift compensation in chemical sensor arrays. The performance of OSC is also compared with Component Correction (CC). A simple classification algorithm has been employed for assessing the performance of the algorithms on a dataset composed by measurements of three analytes using an array of seventeen conductive polymer gas sensors over a ten month period...|$|R
5|$|The third {{periodic}} <b>recalibration</b> in 1988–1989 {{revealed that}} the average difference between the IPK and adjusted baseline for the national prototypes was 50μg – in 1889 the baseline of the national prototypes had been adjusted so that the difference was zero. As the IPK is the definitive kilogram, {{there is no way}} of telling whether the IPK had been losing mass or the national prototypes had been gaining mass.|$|E
5|$|Dayton's {{economy is}} {{relatively}} diversified and {{vital to the}} overall economy {{of the state of}} Ohio. In 2008 and 2009, Site Selection magazine ranked Dayton the #1 medium-sized metropolitan area in the U.S. for economic development. Dayton is also among the top 100 metropolitan areas in both exports and export-related jobs, ranked 16 and 14 respectively by the Brookings Institution. The 2010 report placed the value of exports at $4.7billion and the number of export-related jobs at 44,133. The Dayton Metropolitan Statistical Area ranks 4th in Ohio's Gross Domestic Product with a 2008 industry total of $33.78billion. Additionally, Dayton ranks third among 11 major metropolitan areas in Ohio for exports to foreign countries. The Dayton Development Coalition is attempting to leverage the region's large water capacity, estimated to be 1.5trillion gallons of renewable water aquifers, to attract new businesses. Moody's Investment Services revised Dayton's bond rating from A1 to the stronger rating of Aa2 as part of its global <b>recalibration</b> process. Standard & Poor's upgraded Dayton's rating from A+ to AA- in the summer of 2009.|$|E
5|$|The 767 entered {{service with}} United Airlines on September 8, 1982. The aircraft's first {{commercial}} flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route. The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service {{three months later}} with Delta Air Lines. Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including US transcontinental services. American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while Air Canada, China Airlines, and El Al began operating the aircraft in 1983. The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater dispatch reliability than prior jetliners. In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1percent dispatch rate, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft. Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance. Resolved issues were minor and included the <b>recalibration</b> of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an evacuation slide latch, and the repair of a tailplane pivot to match production specifications.|$|E

25|$|Many {{handheld}} breath analyzers sold {{to consumers}} use a silicon oxide sensor (also called a semiconductor sensor) {{to determine the}} blood alcohol concentration. These sensors are far more prone to contamination and interference from substances other than breath alcohol. The sensors require <b>recalibration</b> or replacement every six months. Higher end personal breath analyzers and professional-use breath alcohol testers use platinum fuel cell sensors. These too require <b>recalibration</b> but at less frequent intervals than semiconductor devices, usually once a year.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{half-life}} of fluorine-18 {{is about}} two hours, the prepared dose of a radiopharmaceutical bearing this radionuclide will undergo multiple half-lives of decay during the working day. This necessitates frequent <b>recalibration</b> of the remaining dose (determination of activity per unit volume) and careful planning with respect to patient scheduling.|$|E
25|$|The first naval {{contract}} for the M1895 was let to Winchester for 10,000 rifles in January 1896 (serials 1–9999). However, deliveries of the initial shipment of 10,000 rifles were not completed until 1897, owing to delays caused by manufacturing issues, as well as contract changes imposed by the navy. The latter included {{a significant change in}} ammunition specification, which required extensive test firings followed by <b>recalibration</b> of the sights.|$|E
40|$|Planktonic foraminifera {{are widely}} {{utilized}} for the biostratigraphy of Cretaceous and Cenozoic marine sediments {{and are a}} fundamental component of Cenozoic chronostratigraphy. The recent enhancements in deep sea drilling recovery, multiple coring and high resolution sampling both offshore and onshore, has improved the planktonic foraminiferal calibrations to magnetostratigraphy and/or modified species ranges. This accumulated new information has allowed many of the planktonic foraminiferal bioevents of the Cenozoic to be revised and a reassessment of the planktonic foraminiferal calibrations. We incorporate these developments and amendments into the existing biostratigraphic zonal scheme. In this paper we present an amended low-latitude (tropical and subtropical) Cenozoic planktonic foraminiferal zonation. We compile 187 revised calibrations of planktonic foraminiferal bioevents from multiple sources for the Cenozoic and have incorporated these <b>recalibrations</b> into a revised Cenozoic planktonic foraminiferal biochronology. We review and synthesize these calibrations to both the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS) of the Cenozoic and astronomical time scale (ATS) of the Neogene and late Paleogene. On the whole, these <b>recalibrations</b> are consistent with previous work; however, in some cases, they have led to major adjustments to the duration of biochrons. <b>Recalibrations</b> of the early middle Eocene first appearance datums of Globigerinatheka kugleri, Hantkenina singanoae, Guembelitrioides nuttalli and Turborotalia frontosa have resulted in large changes in the durations of Biochrons E 7, E 8 and E 9. We have introduced (upper Oligocene) Zone O 7 utilizing the biostratigraphic utility of 'Paragloborotalia' pseudokugleri. For the Neogene Period, major revisions are applied to the fohsellid lineage of the middle Miocene and we have modified the criteria for recognition of Zones M 7, M 8 and M 9, with additional adjustments regarding the Globigerinatella lineage to Zones M 2 and M 3. The revised and recalibrated datums provide a major advance in biochronologic resolution and a template for future progress to the Cenozoic time scale...|$|R
40|$|The {{equivalence}} of {{pencil and}} paper Rasch item calibrations when used in a computer adaptive test administration was explored in this study. Items (n= 726) were precalibarted with the {{pencil and paper}} test administrations. A computer adaptive test was administered to 321 medical technology students using the pencil and paper precalibrations in the item selection algorithms and in the computation of examinee ability estimates. The response data from the computer adaptive test administration were analyzed yielding recalibrated item difficulties and examinee ability estimates. Item precalibrations were compared with item <b>recalibrations.</b> Examinee ability estimates obtained using the item precalibrations on the computer adaptive administration were compared with the examinee ability estimates obtained from using the item <b>recalibrations</b> on the computer adaptive administration. The correlation for examinee ability estimates was 0. 99 and for item correlations it was 0. 90. Some item calibrations shifted but most remained consistent {{within the limits of}} error. Item shift, however, did not affect the ordering of examinee ability estimates. (Contains 1 table, 3 figures, and 23 references.)

40|$|Accurate {{measurements}} of the Sun's extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission are of major importance in aeronomical studies of the Earth's upper atmosphere and for studies of the Sun's outer atmosphere, where the radiation originates in the tenuous, high-temperature chromosphere and corona. Current levels of calibration accuracy of space instrumentation used to observe this radiation and accuracies desired in the future are discussed. Several suggestions are made for methods that can provide approximate <b>recalibrations</b> of instruments in orbit using the radiation from the Sun itself...|$|R
25|$|A simple {{error model}} is to {{introduce}} a small error to the data probability term in the homozygous cases, allowing a small constant probability that nucleotides which don't match the A allele are observed in the AA case, and respectively a small constant probability that nucleotides not matching the B allele are observed in the BB case. However more sophisticated procedures are available which attempt to more realistically replicate the actual error patterns observed in real data in calculating the conditional data probabilities. For instance, estimations of read quality (measured as Phred quality scores) have been incorporated in these calculations, {{taking into account the}} expected error rate in each individual read at a locus. Another technique that has successfully been incorporated into error models is base quality <b>recalibration,</b> where separate error rates are calculated - based on prior known information about error patterns - for each possible nucleotide substitution. Research shows that each possible nucleotide substitution is not equally likely to show up as an error in sequencing data, and so base quality <b>recalibration</b> has been applied to improve error probability estimates.|$|E
25|$|The used test {{equipment}} market, particularly on-line auction venues, typically {{has a wide}} selection of older analog scopes available. However it is becoming more difficult to obtain replacement parts for these instruments, and repair services are generally unavailable from the original manufacturer. Used instruments are usually out of calibration, and <b>recalibration</b> by companies with the equipment and expertise usually costs more than the second-hand value of the instrument.|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of the century, the various {{national}} prototypes of the kilogram were recalibrated against the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK) and therefore against each other. The initial 1889 starting-value offsets of the national prototypes relative to the IPK were nulled, [...] with any subsequent mass changes being relative to the IPK. A technique for steam cleaning the prototypes to remove any contaminants was developed in 1946 as part of the second <b>recalibration.</b>|$|E

40|$|The site of {{adaptation}} resulting {{from exposure to}} spatially discordant visual and auditory cues was determined by comparing, for both sensory modalities, shifts in pointings with shifts in estimations of 'straight ahead'. The exposure task consisted of monitoring a synchronous series of flashes and noises separated 15 ° laterally by prisms. The shifts it produced for both modalities were of nearly equal magnitude in the two tests. The results suggest that auditory visual conflict is resolved through <b>recalibrations</b> {{at the level of}} sound head and of eye head articulations.

50|$|Indium {{antimonide}} photodiode detectors are photovoltaic, generating {{electric current}} when subjected to infrared radiation. InSb's {{internal quantum efficiency}} is effectively 100% but {{is a function of}} the thickness particularly for near bandedge photons. Like all narrow bandgap materials InSb detectors require periodic <b>recalibrations,</b> increasing the complexity of the imaging system. This added complexity is worthwhile where extreme sensitivity is required, e.g. in long-range military thermal imaging systems. InSb detectors also require cooling, as they have to operate at cryogenic temperatures (typically 80 K). Large arrays (up to 2048x2048 pixels) are available. HgCdTe and PtSi are materials with similar use.|$|R

Calibration errors owing to temperature drift, wire degradation, changes in ambient conditions etc can lead to substantial uncertainties in hot-wire measurements. A new calibration procedure is implemented here to account for most forms of drift that are typically encountered during high quality flow measurements using hot-wires. The method involves obtaining single point <b>recalibrations</b> of the hot-wire (in the free-stream) at regular intervals {{during the course of}} an actual experiment, and using these during post-processing to correct for any drift encountered. Unlike many other existing schemes, this proposed calibration correction method is not solely restricted to correcting temperature drift...|$|R

It seeks to highlight the elites who develop the social codes embedded within credit scoring software, to offer insight into the complex techno-economic networks that produce the geographies of financial inclusion, exclusion, and differential risk pricing. It is argued that the scientific status of these systems is questionable, due to the social interactions involved within the statistical modelling. Finally, the paper suggests that the spaces of credit are fluid, based upon the frequent social <b>recalibrations</b> of these models. ...|$|R

After the 1950s selenium in photocells was gradually replaced by CdS and CdSe. By 1960, ROs based on incandescent lamps and CdS/CdSe photoresistors were used in feedback circuits in the industry, for example, for controlling rotation speed and voltage. In the early 1960s, the introduction of sensitive and compact CdS/CdSe photoresistors resulted in the mass production of cameras with automatic exposure. However, these photoresistors were not adopted in medicine because of their memory effect and rapid aging – they required regular <b>recalibration</b> that was not acceptable for medical practice.|$|E

However, a great limitation of this generation of robots is a complete lack of any tactile feedback: the surgeon cannot feel what he is doing, so he must rely completely on visual feedback to check his incisions, sutures and so on. A secondary drawback to this generation of robot is the average size and bulkiness, limiting the movements of surgical staff {{around the table and}} necessitating time-consuming <b>recalibrations</b> whenever the patient must be moved.|$|R
