40|$|The Flexible Array Concentrator Technology (FACT) is a lightweight, {{high-performance}} reflective concentrator blanket assembly {{that can}} be used on flexible solar array blankets. The FACT concentrator replaces every other row of solar cells on a solar array blanket, significantly reducing the cost of the array. The modular design is highly scalable for the array system designer, and exhibits compact stowage, good off-pointing acceptance, and mass/cost savings. The assembly s relatively low concentration ratio, accompanied by a large radiative area, provides for a low cell operating temperature, and eliminates many of the thermal problems inherent in high-concentration-ratio designs. Unlike other reflector technologies, the FACT concentrator modules function on both z-fold and rolled flexible solar array blankets, as well as rigid array systems. Mega-ROSA (Mega <b>Roll-Out</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>Array)</b> is a new, highly modularized and extremely scalable version of ROSA that provides immense power level range capability from 100 kW to several MW in size. Mega-ROSA will enable extremely high-power spacecraft and SEP-powered missions, including space-tug and largescale planetary science and lunar/asteroid exploration missions. Mega-ROSA's inherent broad power scalability is achieved while retaining ROSA s solar array performance metrics and missionenabling features for lightweight, compact stowage volume and affordability. This innovation will enable future ultra-high-power missions through lowcost (25 to 50 % cost savings, depending on PV and blanket technology), lightweight, high specific power (greater than 200 to 400 Watts per kilogram BOL (beginning-of-life) at the wing level depending on PV and blanket technology), compact stowage volume (greater than 50 kilowatts per cubic meter for very large arrays), high reliability, platform simplicity (low failure modes), high deployed strength/stiffness when scaled to huge sizes, and high-voltage operation capability. Mega-ROSA is adaptable to all photovoltaic and concentrator flexible blanket technologies, and can readily accommodate standard multijunction and emerging ultra-lightweight IMM (inverted metamorphic) photovoltaic flexible blanket assemblies, as well as ENTECHs Stretched Lens Array (SLA) and DSSs (Deployable Space Systems) FACT, which allows for cost reduction at the array level...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of large area <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> flexibility on the attitude {{control of a}} solar electric spacecraft is analyzed. The spacecraft consists of a rigid central body, two flexible <b>roll-out</b> <b>solar</b> <b>arrays,</b> and a cluster of three electric propulsion engines. Each engine has gimballing or translational capacity, or both, for attitude control purposes. A parametric stability study of various spacecraft configurations was made, using hybrid coordinate techniques in an eigenvalue analysis. Parameters varied were <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> aspect ratio, <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> first natural frequency, <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> rotation angle about the yaw axis, and sensor gain factors. Only the first six modes of <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> vibration {{were included in the}} study. The attitude response characteristics of the various spacecraft configurations were obtained by means of a digital computer simulation program of the system's equations of motion. The feasibility of using the thrusters for attitude control of electric propulsion spacecraft is demonstrated. It is also shown that although the dynamics effects of large-area flexible <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> can be harmful, changes in the control system parameters can insure stable attitude control...|$|R
40|$|Large {{deployable}} space {{structures are}} an integral part of reflectors, earth observation satellite antennas and radars, observation and radar targets, radiators, sun shields, solar sails and <b>solar</b> <b>arrays.</b> Launch vehicle faring sizes have not increased in the last three decades, meaning ever more efficient ways of packaging large space structures must be sought. Deployable structures come with the promise and capability of reducing payload mass substantially and allowing for very compact storage of systems during the launch phase. Gossamer structures hold particular promise for systems involving large apertures, solar panels, thermal shields and solar/deorbiting sails. The Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of a great part of these technologies is still very low (in the order of 2 - 3). The objective of DEPLOYTECH is to develop three specific, useful, robust, and innovative large deployable space structures to a TRL of 6 - 8 in the next three years. These include: a 10 m 2 (3. 6 m diameter) sail structure that uses in atable technology for deployment and support; a 5 × 1 m <b>roll-out</b> exible <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> that utilizes bistable composite booms; and 14 m solar sail CFRP booms with a novel deployment mechanism for extension control. © 2013 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

The present effort required {{the design of a}} modular <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> panel consisting of superstrate modules interconnected to provide the structural support for the solar cells. The effort was divided into two tasks: (1) superstrate <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> panel design, and (2) superstrate <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> panel-to-panel design.

40|$|It {{has been}} known for many years, based partly on NASA Glenn Research Center testing, that {{high-voltage}} <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> arc into the space plasma environment. <b>Solar</b> <b>arrays</b> are composed of solar cells in series with each other (a string), and the strings may be connected in parallel to produce the entire <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> power. Arcs on <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> can damage or destroy solar cells, and in the extreme case of sustained arcing, entire <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> strings, in a flash. In the case of sustained arcing (discovered at Glenn and applied to the design and construction of <b>solar</b> <b>arrays</b> on Space Systems/Loral (SS/Loral, Palo Alto, CA) satellites, Deep-Space 1, and Terra), an arc on one <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> string can couple to an adjacent string and continue to be powered by the <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> output until a permanent electrical short is produced.

50|$|On November 26, 2005, the back-up <b>solar</b> <b>array</b> {{drive on}} Landsat 5 began exhibiting unusual behavior.
