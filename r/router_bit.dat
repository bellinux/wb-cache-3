30|$|Modelling and {{experimental}} {{analysis of the}} orthogonal cutting mechanics of MDF are performed by Dippon et al. [18]. The experimental {{results showed that the}} friction on the rake face is rather small, and the pressure exerted by the uncut chip on the rake face mainly dominates the force on the rake face. The proposed cutting constants can be used to predict the cutting forces in machining MDF with tools having complex geometry such as <b>router</b> <b>bits.</b>|$|R
50|$|Spindle speed becomes {{important}} {{in the operation of}} routers, spindle moulders or shapers, and drills. Older and smaller routers often rotate at a fixed spindle speed, usually between 20,000 and 25,000 rpm. While these speeds are fine for small <b>router</b> <b>bits,</b> using larger bits, say more than 1 in or 25 millimeters in diameter, can be dangerous and can lead to chatter. Larger routers now have variable speeds and larger bits require slower speed. Drilling wood generally uses higher spindle speeds than metal, and the speed is not as critical. However, larger diameter drill bits do require slower speeds to avoid burning.|$|R

5000|$|A [...] "pin router" [...] {{accessory}} is used. A pin router {{originally had}} a pin {{in the table}} that would trace the part and hung the router motor on an [...] "over arm" [...] that rose from one edge or corner of the router table, arced over the table, and descends directly (coaxially) towards the pin. This was a big safety concern as people's hand were very accessible to the cutter. In 1976 C.R. Onsrud patented the Inverted Pin Router that reversed the two and mounted the motor {{under the table and}} the guide pin on the [...] "over arm". A template (with an interior recess on the top face removed) is affixed to the workpiece, and the guide pin is lowered into this recess. The template is then moved against the pin, carrying the workpiece against the spinning <b>router</b> <b>bit</b> and creating a duplicate of the patterned part.|$|E
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of changes in the helical angle of the <b>router</b> <b>bit</b> on the acoustic emission (AE) signal for various workpiece grain angles. The helical angle varied from 0 ° to 50 ° at 10 ° increments. The workpiece grains were oriented from 0 degrees (cutting parallel to the grain), through 90 ° (cutting end of the grain), to 165 ° at 15 ° increments. The AE signals and machined surface roughness were measured in an attempt to clarify the relations between them. The results were summarized as follows: (1) The AE signals were lowest in the “with the grain” cutting zones and slightly increased in the “against the grain” cutting zones; they rapidly reached the highest values at the 135 °– 165 ° grain angles. The greater the helical angle of the <b>router</b> <b>bit,</b> the smaller were the AE count rates for each grain angle investigated. There was no significant change in AE generation for helical angles of 0 ° and 10 °. Moreover, the greater the feed rate, the greater was the AE count rate for every cutting condition investigated. (2) The surface roughness, similar to the AE count rate, had the lowest values in the “with the grain” cutting zones, slightly increased until the 120 ° grain angle, and then rapidly become extremely rough, reaching a maximum at the grain angles of 135 °– 150 °. There was no remarkable change in the machined surface roughness while routing “with the grain” using the <b>router</b> <b>bit</b> of greater helical angle. However, when routing “against the grain,” the greater the helical angle the smoother was the machined surface. (3) There were correlations between the AE count rate and the machined surface roughness for each helical angle investigated. Therefore, acoustic emission has shown promise for monitoring and controlling the routing operation, including various grain angles and helical angles of the <b>router</b> <b>bit.</b>|$|E

50|$|A {{router table}} is a {{stationary}} woodworking machine in which a vertically oriented spindle of a woodworking router protrudes from the machine table and can be spun at speeds typically between 3000 and 24,000 rpm. Cutter heads (<b>router</b> <b>bits)</b> may be mounted in the spindle chuck. As the workpiece is fed into the machine, the cutters mold a profile into it. The machine normally features a vertical fence, against which the workpiece is guided to control the horizontal depth of cut. Router tables are used to increase the versatility of a hand-held router, as each method of use is particularly suited to specific application, e.g. very large workpieces would be too large to support on a router table and must be routed with a hand-held machine, very small workpieces would not support a hand-held router and must be routed on a router table {{with the aid of}} pushtool accessories etc.|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{machining}} experiments on the Oil-Palm Empty Fruit Bunch (OPEFB) particleboard {{were carried out}} using a CNC router, to evaluate the tool wearing properties of the composite {{in comparison to the}} conventional wood-material particleboard. A single-fluted tungsten-carbide <b>router</b> <b>bit</b> (12 mm φ, 18 000 rpm), with a rake angle of 15 ° was used in this experiment, in which the depth of cut was 1. 5 mm and feed speed was 4. 5 m min - 1. The <b>router</b> <b>bit</b> machined the edge of the board, moving along the full length before returning to repeat the cycle. The tool was examined for the extent of wear after complete failure had occurred. The result found that the wear pattern was similar in the oil-palm based particleboard and the wood-based particleboard, but the former was twice more abrasive compared to the latter. Microscopic examination of the cutter edge revealed greater incidence of micro-fracture when cutting the oil-palm based particleboard, indicating the presence of hard impurities in the composite. From an economic perspective, the tooling cost for machining oil-palm based particleboard is estimated to be twice of the cost for machining wood-based particleboard. This study shows that the machining properties of oil-palm based particleboard will be a primary concern, if the board is to find widespread application as a potential substitute for wood-based particleboard...|$|E
30|$|In {{industrial}} machining of timber, {{the method}} {{in which the}} operator visually inspects both wear and chippings of <b>router</b> <b>bits</b> after stopping the machine is generally adopted.

30|$|The {{effect of}} the helix angle of a <b>router</b> <b>bit</b> on chip {{formation}} and electric energy per volume (specific energy) under different feed speeds and cutting depths during the milling of maple and China fir by a computer numerically controlled (CNC) router was investigated. The peripheral cutting edge of router bits were custom-made at helix angles of 0 °, 2 °, 4 °, 6 °, and 8 °. The feed speed varied from 600 to 4800 mm/min, and the depths of cut were set at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 mm. The chips were classified by sieving into a flake type, a splinter type (5 and 10 mesh), a flow type (20 and 40 mesh), and a granule type (< 40 mesh). As the feed speed and the cutting depth increased for the five router bits, more chips of the flake type and the splinter type were produced. However, the number of granule-type chips under the larger helix angle was reduced. The energy per volume removed (specific energy) increased with the feed speed {{and the depth of}} cut while milling maple and China fir. More specific energy per cubic centimeter was consumed under the lower feed speeds and the smaller depth of cut. The specific energy can be expressed as a negative power function of the feed speed or the cutting depth for maple and China fir.|$|E
5000|$|These are {{the most}} popular among homebuilders. Some {{professional}} builders also offer both kits and finished boats.

The strips are shaped with bead and cove <b>router</b> <b>bits.</b> Stripping begins at the sheer line and finishes with [...] "the football". The strips are edge-glued to each other, being held in place with nails, staples, or simply clamped to the forms. Once the strips are glued together, and the staples/nails removed, the inside and outside are sanded fair. Fiberglass and epoxy is applied to the canoe inside and out. The fiberglass covering is transparent, waterproof, and allowing the wood strips to be seen. The strips are usually cedar, but can be any type of wood. Contrasting woods are sometimes used as accent strips. The last steps in construction is to install the seats, thwarts, and gunwales. Finally a coat of marine grade polyurethane is applied to protect the wood and epoxy from ultraviolet light.|$|R

40|$|The Distributed Denial-of-Service {{attack is}} a serious threat in Internet and an {{effective}} method is needed for distinguishing the attack traffic from the legitimate traffic. We propose the concept of bit marking to identify and drop the attack packets. Bit marking is a variation of packet marking technique that modifies the packet header at each <b>router.</b> However <b>bit</b> marking differs from packet marking in its process and the purpose. Instead of storing the router information in the packets, bit marking alters one or more bits in the marking field at each <b>router.</b> The <b>bit</b> positions for each ingress line card are selected randomly only once at the initialization. Such bit marking is performed to all the packets, resulting in a common path signature in the marking field upon arriving at a destination for all the packets originating from the same location. Since the packets traversing different paths {{are likely to have}} different path signatures, the bit marking process generates quite unique path signature for different sources, roughly emulating the source IP. Such Path Signature allows an easy identification and blocking of the DDoS attack. We show that the PS becomes more diverse as the lengths of the distinct path increases. From an artificial and real Internet topology we observe that the sources are uniformly distributed over th...|$|R
2500|$|The first {{handheld}} power routers {{were invented}} in 1915 and were Jet Motor Hand Routers, called Onsruters. The name derives {{from a combination}} of the inventor's last name [...] "Onsrud" [...] and the term [...] "router". The Onsruter married a router plane with an endmill to create the first handheld power router. The idea for the Onsruter started when a rail road company decided they wanted to power the front light on a Steam Locomotive using exhaust steam from the engine. Oscar Onsrud and his son Rudy came up with, and submitted, a design for a jet motor (air turbine) to generate the power for the light, however, they failed to win the contract. A few months later Rudy was talking with a friend about his frustrations making the groove {{in the bottom of a}} cane bottom chair using a router plane. A spark went off in Rudy's head that he could re-purpose the jet motor, which he had spent so much time developing, to run on compressed air and spin a modified endmill and make the routed groove easily. The modified endmills would have to spin at 30,000 RPM, instead of the 3,000 RPM of a milling machine, in order to cut wood and not burn it. These bits also needed a steeper rake and clearance angle to evacuate the chips than needed on a traditional endmill. These new bits became known as <b>router</b> <b>bits</b> or <b>router</b> cutters (UK).|$|R
