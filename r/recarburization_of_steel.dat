40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} {{alloying}} elements, heating rate and quenching temperature on the hardness <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> 42 CrMo after induction hardening were investigated by thermal simulation tests, hardness tests, optical microscopy(OM) and scanning electronic microscopy(SEM). The steel No. 2 {{was obtained by}} adding 1. 49 % Ni and reducing 0. 32 % Cr in steel No. 1. Experimental {{results show that the}} hardness <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 1 decreases while that <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 2 slightly increases under the quenched temperature of 900 °C when the heating rate increases from 100 °C/s to 300 °C/s. When the heating rate is 300 °C/s, the hardness <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 1 increases sharply with the elevating of the quenched temperature. However, the hardness <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 2 increases gently with the quenched temperature increasing below 900 °C but keeps constant above 900 °C. It is interesting that the hardness <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 2 is obviously higher than that <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 1 under the same heating process. This phenomenon {{can be attributed to the}} following aspects: firstly, the Ac 1 and Ac 3 temperatures can largely decrease and the dissolution of carbide proceeds further; secondly, the addition of alloying element and the dissolution of carbide in the austenite can improve the hardenability <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> and thus increase the volume percentage of martensite in the quenched microstructure; in addition, the quenched microstructure <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 2 is finer than that <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 1 which undoubtedly helps the increase of hardness. In consideration the disadvantage of higher quenched temperature and heating rate, it is comprehensive to determine the quenched temperature as 900 °C and heating rate as 100 °C/s in order to increase the hardness <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> No. 2...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Test of two {{specimens}} (four different joints) <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> {{secondary beam}} embedded in reinforced concrete girder in frame structure and one specimen with steel cantilever beam embedded in reinforced concrete girder under static load were conducted. The steel beam up-flange was pulled {{out because of}} the concrete cracks caused by the moment, shear and torsion at the upper zone of the concrete beam near the steel beam end. Shear failure of the concrete beam and the top flange pullout failure are the most hazardous failure modes. Lacking restraint of concrete and the reinforcement <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> bar in the concrete slab and catenary action <b>of</b> restraint <b>steel</b> beam, the capacity <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> cantilever beam is much smaller than other beams. Load-slip curve of top flange <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> beam, load-rotation curve <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> beam end are obtained through experiment.

Analytical results of ABAQUS are shown as follows.

30|$|Concrete is {{the most}} widely used {{construction}} materials in the world due to its low cost and easy availability of its ingredients. It also exhibits excellent strength properties in compression. However, it easily cracks in tension, flexure and shear as well as due to various environmental factors such as thermal cracking, shrinkage cracking, freeze–thaw, etc., during its service life. The formation of cracks adversely affect its durability properties with most significant effect on the de-passivation <b>of</b> reinforcing <b>steel</b> in reinforced concrete (RC), resulting in corrosion <b>of</b> <b>steel.</b> The presence <b>of</b> cracks shorten the corrosion initiation time <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> and also accelerates the propagation of corrosion during service life resulting in significant corrosion induced damage and loss of sectional and load carrying capacity of RC structures. The formation of cracks in RC is unavoidable due to its low tensile strength. The cracks thus form in concrete varies in widths, numbers, geometry, depths, etc. (Mehta and Gerwick 1982). These factors affect the initiation and propagation <b>of</b> corrosion <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> in RC. Considerable number of publications reported the research results on the corrosion <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> in cracked concrete. Most of them studied the corrosion <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> in concrete with different crack widths, while others, in few numbers, studied the effects of number of cracks and their depths on the corrosion <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> in concrete. Conflicting results on the relationship between the crack widths and corrosion <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> in concrete are also reported. In most of the above studies, the corrosion <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> was considered due to penetration of chloride ions. However, carbonation also induces corrosion <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> in concrete and especially in cracked concrete. Very few studies, so far, are reported on this aspect. While many results on the effect of cracks on corrosion <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> in concrete are reported, hardly any paper exists that provides a comprehensive summary and review of existing available results on steel corrosion in cracked concrete, the relationship between crack widths and corrosion, effects of other parameters of crack on corrosion <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> in concrete in a single report.
