However, local Members of Parliament (MPs), including Toby Jessel, MP for Twickenham, complained the project should not be cancelled, as the existing South Circular was completely unacceptable to traffic. The plans were scrapped after Labour won the GLC election that year.|$|E

5|$|In United States {{railroad}} terminology, a troop sleeper was {{a railroad}} passenger car {{which had been}} constructed to serve {{as something of a}} mobile barracks (essentially, a sleeping car) for transporting troops over distances sufficient to require overnight accommodations.

5|$|A simple {{record of}} depth {{and time for}} a dive is useful as a legal record of a diving operation, where this is <b>required,</b> <b>and</b> {{in the case of}} an {{accident}} during the dive, an accurately recorded dive profile can provide useful diagnostic information for treatment of the injured diver and for analysis of the circumstances leading to the accident and the action taken during and after the incident. A proposed dive profile is necessary for effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E
5|$|A water-powered mill in {{the castle}} grounds was {{probably}} built under Henry de Beaumont, 1stEarl of Warwick. By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, {{on the west bank}} of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine house had been added to the mill. The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had stopped being used to grind, but once Warwick Castle was fitted with mains electricity in 1940, the mill was no longer <b>required</b> <b>and</b> was dismantled in 1954. Adjacent to the mill is The Mill Garden which is privately owned but open to the public. Interesting views of the castle can be seen from this garden.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, {{it was not}} {{expected}} that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be <b>required,</b> <b>and</b> many plans and diagrams were destroyed, but by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect, so six Little Boy assemblies were produced at Sandia Base. The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built another 25 Little Boy assemblies in 1947 {{for use by the}} Lockheed P2V Neptune nuclear strike aircraft (which could be launched from, but not land on, the Midway-class aircraft carriers). All the Little Boy units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1933 Whale {{directed}} the romantic comedy By Candlelight which gained good reviews {{and was a}} modest box office hit. In 1934 he directed One More River, an adaptation of the novel {{of the same name}} by John Galsworthy. The film {{tells the story of a}} woman desperate to escape her abusive marriage to a member of the British aristocracy. This was the first of Whale's films for which Production Code Administration approval was <b>required</b> <b>and</b> Universal had a difficult time securing that approval because of the elements of sexual sadism implicit in the husband's abusive behavior.|$|E
5|$|Also in March 1941, 91 Squadron moved in, {{equipped}} with Spitfires. Additional dispersals and fighter pens {{as well as}} three new blister hangars were built during 1941. Typhoons were based at Lympne from March 1942 to February 1944 {{to counter the threat}} posed by the Luftwaffe's newly introduced Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and a runway was extended across Otterpool Lane to accommodate the Typhoons. In November 1944, Lympne was downgraded to Emergency Landing Ground status. Consideration was given to building four runways at Lympne, with the longest being , but it was noted that serious demolition work would be <b>required</b> <b>and</b> a number of roads would need to be closed.|$|E
5|$|Anyone {{attempting}} {{to cross the}} control strips would leave footprints, which were quickly detected by patrols. This enabled the guards to identify otherwise undetected escape attempts, recording how many individuals had crossed, where escape attempts were being made and at which times of day escapees were active. From this information, the guards were able to determine where and when patrols needed to be increased, where improved surveillance from watchtowers and bunkers was <b>required,</b> <b>and</b> which areas needed additional fortifications.|$|E

5|$|At {{the outset}} of the 2006 season, Sanchez competed for the {{starting}} quarterback position; once Booty, a junior, suffered severe back spasms caused by a pre-existing back condition, surgery was <b>required</b> <b>and</b> Sanchez was promoted to run the first-team offense during the spring as Booty recovered. Coaches stated Booty would be considered the starting quarterback when he returned for fall practice. During the 2006 season, Sanchez saw limited playing time in games against Arkansas, Stanford and Oregon. Through those three games, Sanchez completed 3 of his 7 pass attempts for 63 yards and one interception. He also saw additional action against Arizona, Michigan, and Notre Dame but he did not attempt a pass in those contests.|$|E
5|$|Between Kimberley and Mafeking, Maund {{learned from}} Shippard that Grobler {{had been killed}} by a group of Ngwato warriors while {{returning}} to the Transvaal, and that the Boers were threatening to attack the British-protected Ngwato chief, Khama III, in response. Maund volunteered to help defend Khama, writing a letter to his employers explaining that doing so might lay the foundations for a concession from Khama covering territory that the Matabele and Ngwato disputed. Cawston tersely wrote back with orders to make for Bulawayo without delay, but over a month had passed in the time this written exchange <b>required,</b> <b>and</b> Maund had squandered his head start on Rudd. After ignoring a notice Lobengula had posted at Tati, barring entry to white big-game hunters and concession-seekers, the Rudd party arrived at the king's kraal on 21 September 1888, three weeks ahead of Maund.|$|E
5|$|Boxwood {{cut across}} the end-grain is hard enough for fine engraving, {{allowing}} greater detail than in normal woodcutting. This been the dominant method used since Bewick's time. In addition, since a wood engraving is inked on the face, it requires only low pressure to print an image, so the blocks last for many thousands of prints, and importantly can be assembled into a page of metal type for ordinary printing in a single run. In contrast, a copper plate engraving is inked in the engraved grooves, the face being wiped clean of ink before printing, so much higher pressure is <b>required,</b> <b>and</b> images must be printed separately from the text, at far greater expense.|$|E
