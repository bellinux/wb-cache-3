40|$|EDFA, {{as part of}} the Power Plant Physics and Technology programme, {{has been}} working on the pre-conceptual design of a Demonstration Power Plant (DEMO). As part of this programme, a review of the <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{strategy}} considered maintenance solutions compatible with expected environmental conditions, whilst showing potential for meeting the plant availability targets. A key finding was that, for practical purposes, the expected radiation levels prohibit the use of complex remote handling operations to replace the first wall. In 2012 / 13, these <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> activities were further extended, providing an insight into the requirements, constraints and challenges. In particular, the assessment of blanket and divertor maintenance, in light of the expected radiation conditions and availability, has elaborated the need for a very different approach from that of ITER. This activity has produced some very informative virtual reality simulations of the blanket segments and pipe removal that are exceptionally valuable in communicating the complexity and scale of the required operations. Through these simulations, estimates of the maintenance task durations have been possible demonstrating that a full replacement of the blankets within 6 months could be achieved. The design of the first wall, including the need to use sacrificial limiters must still be investigated. In support of the maintenance operations, a first indication of the requirements of an Active <b>Maintenance</b> <b>Facility</b> (AMF) has been elaborated. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|The Super-FRS, Superconducting Fragment Separator, is {{a unique}} machine that {{presents}} several challenging technical problems. One of these is regarding how to conduct maintenance in the target area where high levels of radiation will be generated and human access is forbidden. To address this problem {{the use of a}} <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> system is foreseen. The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a systems engineering (SE) research and development (R&D) approach suitable to develop the Super-FRS Target Area <b>Remote</b> <b>Maintenance</b> Systems (TARMS) and the RH design adaptation of the components in the target area. The Super-FRS target area is described in detail in order to introduce the need for a <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> system. Components in the target area are classified by adopting ITER RH maintenance classification. The general scenario of remote handling and the current target area <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> system are described. Finally, the proposed systems engineering approach is presented...|$|R

40|$|The Industry 4. 0 {{paradigm}} aims {{to introduce}} smart factories which employ {{a high degree}} of automation and interconnectivity of the elements of their production networks. These factories are composed of autonomous production machines which can predict breakdowns or failures, and are capable of decision making. Human supervision is minimized, but in some cases, a human expert might be needed. To reduce the costs of travel, it is desirable to employ a <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> procedure. As this opens up possible security breaches, a security policy must be designed and enforced in the <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> system. This thesis proposes a Software Defined Networking (SDN) based solution to enforce a security policy in the <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> scenario. This solution is implemented as an application module for the Open Network Operating System (ONOS) SDN controller interacting with the policy management tool AuthZForce. The security requirements have been gathered from industry standards such as ISO 27033, and the recommendations of the German Federal Office of Information Security (BSI) for <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The derived security policy rules are represented in the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML). The designed security policy module is tested in a virtual testbed, to show that an extensible ONOS application can serve as a policy enforcement tool in the <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> scenario...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Control Practice Engineering [© Elsevier] and is also available at: [URL] Internet provides a significant benefit for the <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> and fault diagnosis of various devices and plants. One such example is the UK’s distributed aircraft maintenance environment (DAME) (www. cs. york. ac. uk/dame), which provides a genetic test bed for distributed diagnostics based on Grid-enabled technologies. This paper focuses on developing a systematic method for the design of such a <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> systems specifically for process control systems. Design issues of Internet-based <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> systems for process control such as that proposed here include control performance assessment, fault detection, control performance maintenance, and heterogeneous data transfer over the Internet. A back-end and front-end architecture is proposed, in which all the heavy calculations are carried out locally. Light data and the characteristics of any heavy data are sent to the front-end located on the remote server for consideration by remote experts. The <b>remote</b> <b>maintenance</b> system is illustrated by reference to the implementation in a process control rig...|$|R
