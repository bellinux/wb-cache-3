40|$|Abstract Until <b>recently,</b> {{governmental}} <b>organizations</b> played <b>a</b> {{dominant and}} decisive role in natural resource management. However, {{an increasing number}} of studies indicate that this dominant role is developing towards a more facilitating role as equal partner to improve efficiency and create a leaner state. This approach is characterized by complex collaborative relationships between various actors and sectors on multiple levels. To understand this com-plexity in the field of environmental management, we conducted a social network analysis of floodplain man-agement in the Dutch Rhine delta. We charted the current interorganizational relationships between 43 organizations involved in flood protection (blue network) and nature management (green network) and explored the conse-quences of abolishing the central actor in these networks. The discontinuation of this actor will decrease the con-nectedness of actors within the blue and green network and may therefore have a large impact on the exchange of ideas and decision-making processes. Furthermore, our research shows the dependence of non-governmental actors on the main governmental organizations. It seems that the Dutch governmental <b>organizations</b> still have <b>a</b> dominant and controlling role in floodplain management. This challenges the alleged shift from a dominant government towards collaborative governance and calls for detailed analysis of actual governance...|$|R

40|$|Researchers and {{managers}} {{use the term}} “new ” to describe organizational members who have <b>recently</b> joined <b>an</b> <b>organization,</b> but how long are arriving recruits considered “new employees, ” and what factors drive this new-to-old transition? In this paper I hypothesize that co-worker perceptions of an individual’s “newness ” in the <b>organization</b> are <b>a</b> function of 1) the individual’s organizational tenure; 2) the individual’s relative position in the firm’s tenure distribution; 3) the frequency of interaction between the rater and the individual and 4) rater tenure. To evaluate these hypotheses I conducted a sociometric survey among four entrepreneurial organizations (n= 200), asking respondents to evaluate the newness of their co-workers. The results support all four hypotheses but suggest that relative tenure (defined as a member’s percentile rank in the firm’s tenure distribution) is the strongest predictor of organizational newness perceptions. More specifically, “new employees ” are the 30 % of the organization with the lowest tenure. This means that organizational growth and turnover have a major effect on how long arriving recruits are considered new employees, {{which in turn has}} implications for new employee research in areas like socialization, mentoring, training, and career development...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that a major obstacle to evolution understanding is an essentialist view of the biological world. The present study investigated the effects of formal biology instruction on such misconceptions. Participants (N = 291) com-pleted an assessment of their understanding of six aspects of evolution (variation, inheritance, adaptation, domestication, speciation, and extinction) before and after one of six evolutionary-themed courses. Most participants demonstrated pervasive misconceptions at both pretest and posttest. A subset, however, dem-onstrated reliable pre-post gains, and they differed from their peers in that they (a) began the semester with significantly less accurate, yet significantly more consistent, views of evolution, and (b) ended the semester with significantly less consistent, yet significantly more accurate, views of evolution. These findings indi-cate that naïve theories of evolution, while generally resistant to change, are less resistant the more consistent they are, possibly because consistency highlights limitations in their explanatory power and inferential scope.

Study 1 involved previously collected interviews with 560 Kosovar civilian war survivors; Study 2 employed a previously collected sample of 142 British war veterans. Results revealed no change in the diagnostic status under the criteria proposed for ICD- 11 in 87. 5 % of civilian war survivors and 91. 5 % of war veterans. Participants who only met the newly proposed criteria showed lower rates of comorbid major depressive episode than participants who only met DSM-IV criteria (13. 6 % vs. 43. 8 % respectively).

The Swedish society has evolved immensely lately and with it new marketing techniques, new communication tools and new values have seen the light of day. The thesis of this study is to examine how non-profit sport organizations function in the areas of organizational culture, internal communication, consumer surplus and branding. The theories have been selected to provide background knowledge in the different functioning areas of <b>an</b> <b>organization</b> and to see how they cooperate in order to make marketing efforts more effective. The primary data has been collected with the use of semi structured interviews with representatives from the participating organizations. Additional primary data has been collected in the form of observations of published digital posts from the organizations communicational channels, to complement the data received in the interviews. The result shows that the principles of non-profit sports organizations are outdated and therefore differs from the rest of the society. The prevailing culture is one whom focuses primary on performance. This is reflected in their communication where the digital communication is somewhat neglected whilst the verbal forms of communication are highly developed.

40|$|Abstract Background The World Health <b>Organization</b> <b>recently</b> {{recognized}} <b>a</b> {{family of}} neoplasms showing at least partial morphological or immunohistochemical {{evidence of a}} putative perivascular epithelioid cell (PEC) differentiation. These tumors include angiomyolipoma (AML), clear cell "sugar" tumors of the lung (CCST), lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), clear cell myomelanocytic tumors of the falciform ligament and distinctive clear cell tumors at various other anatomic sites. Case presentation & methods A 41 -year old gravida- 1 para- 1 with tuberous sclerosis presented with an incidentally identified 2. 2 cm mass. The morphology and immunohistochemical profile was consistent with PEComa. Distinct aggregates of HMB- 45 epithelioid cells were present in an occasionally distinctive perivascular distribution in the myometrium, small bowel lamina propria and ovarian hila. These distinctive aggregates, for which we propose the designation "PEComatosis" based on their intraabdominal distribution, did not display cytological atypia, mitotic activity or necrosis. CGH and DNA ploidy analysis showed a balanced chromosomal profile and diploid nuclei, respectively. There was no recurrence or metastases at 35 months' follow-up. Fifty-one previously reported cases of non-AML, LAM and CCST PEComas [perivascular epithelioid cell tumors- not otherwise specified (PEComa-NOS) ] are reviewed. Conclusions The lesions may be a reflection of tumor multicentricity, in which each may be a potential nidus {{for the development of}} future more well-developed tumors. Alternatively, they may be a manifestation of a poorly understood "field effect", in which there is an increased propensity to develop tumors of this type throughout the abdomen. Finally, and least likely in our opinion, they may represent tumor spread from its primary site. </p...|$|R
