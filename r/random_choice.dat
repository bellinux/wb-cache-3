Instead, this decision is left open to tournament-specific rules (e.g. a Swiss system tournament or Round-robin tournament) or, {{in the case of}} non-competitive play, mutual agreement, in which case some kind of <b>random</b> <b>choice</b> is often employed. A common method is for one player to conceal a piece (usually a pawn) of each color in either hand; the other player chooses a hand to open, and receives the color of the piece that is revealed.|$|E

25|$|A {{possible}} (but {{not universally}} accepted) solution {{is offered by}} the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics. According to this, not only is collapse of the wave function illusory, but the apparent random branching of possible futures when quantum systems interact with the macroscopic world is also an illusion. Measurement {{does not lead to}} a <b>random</b> <b>choice</b> of possible outcome; rather, the only ingredient of quantum mechanics is the unitary evolution of the wave function. All possibilities co-exist forever and the only reality is the quantum mechanical wave function. According to this view, two distant observers both split into superpositions when measuring a spin. The Bell inequality violations are no longer counterintuitive, because it is not clear which copy of the observer B will be seen by observer A when they compare notes. If reality includes all the different outcomes, locality in physical space (not outcome space) places no restrictions on how the split observers can meet up.|$|E

[...] Fresh are his ruddy cheeks, his forehead fair; [...] 120 [...] And like the burnished gold his curling hair. [...] But clear thy wrinkled brow, and quit thy sorrow, [...] I'd scorn your 'prentice, should you die to-morrow. [...] Why are thy chests all locked? on what design? [...] Are not thy worldly goods and treasures mine? [...] 125 [...] Sir, I'm no fool; nor shall you, by St. John, [...] Have goods and body to yourself alone.

[...] There's danger too, you think, in rich array, [...] 140 [...] And none can long be modest that are gay: [...] The cat, if you but singe her tabby skin, [...] The chimney keeps, and sits content within; [...] But once grown sleek, will from her corner run, [...] Sport with her tail, and wanton in the sun; [...] 145 [...] She licks her fair round face, and frisks abroad, [...] To show her fur, and to be catterwawed.[8] [...] Lo thus, my friends, I wrought to my desires [...] These three right ancient venerable sires. [...] I told 'em, Thus you say, and thus you do, [...] 150 [...] And told 'em false, but Jenkin swore 'twas true. [...] I, like a dog, could bite as well as whine, [...] And first complained, whene'er the guilt was mine.[9] [...] I taxed them oft with wenching and amours, [...] When their weak legs scarce dragged 'em out of doors; [...] 155 [...] And swore the rambles that I took by night, [...] Were all to spy what damsels they bedight. [...] That colour brought me many hours of mirth;[10] [...] For all this wit is given us from our birth; [...] Heav'n gave to woman the peculiar grace, [...] 160 [...] To spin, to weep, and cully human race. [...] By this nice conduct, and this prudent course, [...] By murm'ring, wheedling, stratagem, and force, [...] I still prevailed, and would be in the right, [...] Or curtain lectures made a restless night. [...] 165 [...] If once my husband's arm was o'er my side, [...] What! so familiar with your spouse? I cried: [...] I levied first a tax upon his need: [...] Then let him--'twas a nicety indeed! [...] Let all mankind this certain maxim hold, [...] 170 [...] Marry who will, our sex is to be sold. [...] With empty hands no tassels you can lure,[11] [...] But fulsome love for gain we can endure; [...] For gold we love the impotent and old, [...] And heave, and pant, and kiss, and cling, for gold. [...] 175 [...] Yet with embraces, curses oft I've mixed, [...] Then kissed again, and chid, and railed betwixt. [...] Well, I may make my will in peace, and die, [...] For not one word in man's arrears am I. [...] To drop a dear dispute I was unable, [...] 180 [...] Ev'n though the Pope himself had sat at table.[12] [...] But when my point was gained, then thus I spoke, [...] "Billy, my dear, how sheepishly you look? [...] Approach, my spouse, and let me kiss thy cheek; [...] Thou should'st be always thus resigned and meek! [...] 185 [...] Of Job's great patience since so oft you preach, [...] Well should you practise, who so well can teach. [...] 'Tis difficult to do, I must allow, [...] But I, my dearest, will instruct you how. [...] Great is the blessing of a prudent wife, [...] 190 [...] Who puts a period to domestic strife. [...] One of us two must rule, and one obey; [...] } [...] And since in man right reason bears the sway, [...] } [...] Let that frail thing, weak woman, have her way. } [...] The wives of all my family have ruled [...] 195 [...] Their tender husbands, and their passions cooled. [...] Fye, 'tis unmanly thus to sigh and groan; [...] What! would you have me to yourself alone? [...] Why take me, love! take all and ev'ry part! [...] Here's your revenge! you love it at your heart. [...] 200 [...] Would I vouchsafe to sell what nature gave, [...] You little think what custom I could have. [...] But see! I'm all your own--nay hold--for shame! [...] What means my dear--indeed--you are to blame." [...] Thus with my first three lords I passed my life; [...] 205 [...] A very woman, and a very wife. [...] What sums from these old spouses I could raise, [...] Procured young husbands in my riper days. [...] Though past my bloom,[13] not yet decayed was I, [...] Wanton and wild, and chattered like a pye. [...] 210 [...] In country dances still I bore the bell. [...] And sung as sweet as ev'ning Philomel. [...] To clear my quail-pipe, and refresh my soul, [...] Full oft I drained the spicy nut-brown bowl; [...] Rich luscious wines, that youthful blood improve, [...] 215 [...] And warm the swelling veins to feats of love: [...] For 'tis as sure as cold ingenders hail, [...] A liqu'rish mouth must have a lech'rous tail; [...] Wine lets no lover unrewarded go, [...] As all true gamesters by experience know. [...] 220 [...] But oh, good gods! whene'er a thought I cast [...] On all the joys of youth and beauty past, [...] To find in pleasures I have had my part, [...] Still warms me to the bottom of my heart.

[...] The flour consumed, the best that now I can, [...] Is e'en to make my market of the bran.[14] [...] My fourth dear spouse was not exceeding true! [...] He kept, 'twas thought, a private miss or two: [...] 230 [...] But all that score I paid--as how? you'll say, [...] Not with my body, in a filthy way: [...] But I so dressed, and danced, and drank, and dined; [...] And viewed a friend, with eyes so very kind, [...] As stung his heart, and made his marrow fry,[15] [...] 235 [...] With burning rage, and frantic jealousy. [...] His soul, I hope, enjoys eternal glory, [...] For here on earth I was his purgatory. [...] Oft, when his shoe the most severely wrung, [...] He put on careless airs, and sat and sung. [...] 240 [...] How sore I galled him, only heav'n could know, [...] And he that felt, and I that caused the woe. [...] He died, when last from pilgrimage I came, [...] With other gossips, from Jerusalem;[16] [...] And now lies buried underneath a rood,[17] [...] 245 [...] Fair to be seen, and reared of honest wood. [...] A tomb indeed, with fewer sculptures graced, [...] Than that Mausolus' pious widow placed,[18] [...] Or where inshrined the great Darius lay; [...] But cost on graves is merely thrown away. [...] 250 [...] The pit filled up, with turf we covered o'er; [...] So bless the good man's soul, I say no more. [...] Now for my fifth loved lord, the last and best; [...] (Kind heav'n afford him everlasting rest) [...] Full hearty was his love, and I can shew [...] 255 [...] The tokens on my ribs in black and blue; [...] Yet, with a knack, my heart he could have won, [...] While yet the smart was shooting in the bone. [...] How quaint an appetite in woman reigns! [...] Free gifts we scorn, and love what costs us pains: [...] 260 [...] Let men avoid us, and on them we leap; [...] A glutted market makes provision cheap.[19] [...] In pure good will I took this jovial spark, [...] Of Oxford he, a most egregious clerk. [...] He boarded with a widow in the town,[20] [...] 265 [...] A trusty gossip, one dame Alison. [...] Full well the secrets of my soul she knew, [...] Better than e'er our parish priest could do. [...] To her I told whatever could befall: [...] Had but my husband pissed against a wall, [...] 270 [...] Or done a thing that might have cost his life, [...] She, and my niece, and one more worthy wife, [...] Had known it all: what most he would conceal, [...] To these I made no scruple to reveal.

In few cases, randomly chosen nodes will run faster but we are ignoring <b>random</b> <b>choices</b> because <b>random</b> <b>choices</b> might get huge amount of time to reach a consensus decisions. So, we can claim that the probability of our algorithm runs faster than random choice-based algorithm like gossip algorithm.|$|R

40|$|Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) {{networks}} {{based on}} consistent hashing functions have an inherent load uneven distribution problem. Things are even worse in unstructured P 2 P systems. The objective of load balancing in P 2 P networks is {{to balance the}} workload of the network nodes in proportion to their capacity so as to eliminate traffic bottleneck. It is challenging because of the dynamic nature of overlay networks and time-varying load characteristics. <b>Random</b> <b>choices</b> schemes can balance load effectively while incurring only a small overhead, making such schemes appealing for practical systems. Existing theoretical work analyzing properties of <b>random</b> <b>choices</b> algorithms can not be applied in the highly dynamic and heterogeneous P 2 P systems. In this paper, we characterize the behaviors of randomized search schemes in the general P 2 P environment. We extend the supermarket model by investigating the impact of node heterogeneity and churn to the load distribution in P 2 P networks. We prove that by using d-way <b>random</b> <b>choices</b> schemes, {{the length of the}} longest queue in P 2 P systems with heterogeneous nodal capacity and node churn for d ≥ 2 is clog logn/logd + O(1) with high probability, where c is a constant.
