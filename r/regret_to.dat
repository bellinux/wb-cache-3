25|$|It {{would give}} me great {{pleasure}} to comply with his request and see you personally, but, as the military laws of my country prohibit me from going on board a foreign vessel, I <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> have to decline this honor and to ask that you will kindly come on shore, where I await you to accede to your wishes as far as possible, and to agree as to our mutual situations. Asking your pardon for the trouble I cause you, I guarantee your safe return to your ship.|$|E
25|$|The Rev. Mr. Leslie, of Castlebellingham, who {{threatened}} the Gaelic league with his wrath for daring {{to hold a}} Feis on Sunday, has, we <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> say, found an imitator in a Catholic clergyman {{at the other side}} of Ireland – the Rev. Father Donor, of Shanagolden. This gentleman acted similarly towards the Gaelic League of Foynes, which proposed to hold its Feis on a Sunday, and to appease him the Feis was held on a week day, with the result that numbers of people were deprived from attending it. Although the Sunday fixture was abandoned to please him, neither Father Donor nor any of his curates attended the Feis.|$|E

25|$|It wasn't easy to {{find the}} YPSL in Columbia, Missouri. But I had read about it and I wanted to be one. We had a very limited number of {{activities}} in Columbia, Missouri. We had an anti-Franco rally, which was a worthy cause. You could raise a question about how relevant it {{was likely to be}} in Columbia, Missouri, but it was in any case a worthy cause. We also planned a socialist picnic, which we spent quite a lot of time organizing. Eventually, I <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> say, the YPSL chapter, after much discussion, many debates and some downright quarrels, broke up over the socialist picnic. I thought that was rather discouraging.|$|E
25|$|I <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> {{say that}} none of us {{approved}} of the marriage at that time. Mother thought Jack was too young, and Lottie and I felt that Olive, being in musical comedy, belonged to an alien world. Ollie had all the rich, eligible men of the social world at her feet. She had been deluged with proposals from her own world of the theater as well. Which was not at all surprising. The beauty of Olive Thomas is legendary. The girl had the loveliest violet-blue eyes I have ever seen. They were fringed with long dark lashes that seemed darker because of the delicate translucent pallor of her skin. I could understand why Florenz Ziegfeld never forgave Jack for taking her away from the Follies. She and Jack were madly in love with one another but I always thought of them as a couple of children playing together.|$|E
25|$|On 29 October 1914, {{after the}} pursuit of Goeben and Breslau, Breslau bombarded the Russian Black Sea port of Theodosia. On 30 October the High Command in Istanbul changed the force distribution. On 2 November Grand Vizier Said Halim Pasha {{expressed}} <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> the Allies {{for the actions of}} the navy. Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Sazonov said it was too late and that Russia considered the raid an act of war. The Cabinet tried to explain that hostilities were begun without its sanction by German officers serving in the navy. The Allies insisted on reparations to Russia, the dismissal of German officers from the Goeben and Breslau, and the internment of the German ships {{until the end of the}} war, but before the Ottoman government could respond, Great Britain and France declared war on the Ottoman Empire on 5 November. The Ottoman Committee of Union and Progress's official Declaration of War came on 14 November.|$|E

500|$|In {{his public}} speaking, Saint-Just {{was even more}} daring and outspoken than his mentor Robespierre. Regarding France's {{internal}} strife, he spared few: “You have to punish not only the traitors, but {{even those who are}} indifferent; you have to punish whoever is passive in the republic, and who does nothing for it.” He thought the only way to create a true republic was to rid it of enemies, to enforce the “complete destruction of its opposite.” Regarding the war, he declared without <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> the Convention, “The vessel of the Revolution can arrive in port only on a sea reddened with torrents of blood.” He urged the deputies to embrace the notion that “a nation generates itself only upon heaps of corpses.” ...|$|E

[...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, without saying anything, he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s British news media were {{dominated}} by several high-profile spying stories: {{the breaking of the}} Portland spy ring in 1961, the capture and sentencing of George Blake in the same year and, in 1962, the case of the Admiralty clerk, John Vassall, blackmailed into spying by the Soviets who threatened to expose his homosexuality. In October 1962 Vassall was jailed for 18 years. [...] After suggestions in the press that Vassall had been shielded by his political masters, the responsible minister, Thomas Galbraith, resigned from the government pending inquiries. Galbraith was later exonerated by the Radcliffe inquiry, which sent two newspaper journalists to prison for refusing to reveal their sources for sensational and uncorroborated stories about Vassall's private life. The imprisonment severely damaged relations between the press and the Macmillan government; the New Statesmans columnist Paul Johnson warned: [...] "ny Tory minister or MP... who gets involved in a scandal during {{the next year or so}} must expect—I <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> say—the full treatment".|$|E

500|$|The Indian {{television}} {{premiere of}} The Dirty Picture {{was set to}} be telecast on Sony Entertainment Television on 22 April 2012 at 12 noon and 8pm IST. The Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court allowed the TV channel {{to go ahead with}} the scheduled telecast after the Central Board of Film Certification had cleared the film with 56 cuts, 36 of which were done by the producers, while other cuts were suggested by the Certification Board. It had to go through these cuts as the telecast of an adult-rated film during prime time in India is a violation of the Cable TV Network Rules, 1994 and the Cable TV Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995. Following this process, Sony Entertainment Television promoted the scheduled telecast. However, on the scheduled day, the film was not telecast, with the channel putting up a message stating, [...] "For unavoidable reasons we <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> inform that The Dirty Picture will not be telecast today. Any inconvenience caused is deeply regretted." [...] The Information and Broadcast Ministry informed the TV channel that it can air the film only after prime time: post 11pm.|$|E
500|$|The hearing {{took six}} days, {{finishing}} on 18 February 2008, with the judgment being made public on 17 March 2008. Mills was eventually awarded {{a lump sum}} of £16.5m, together with assets of £7.8m, which included the properties she owned at the time. The total was £24.3million (nearly $50 million in US currency,) plus payments of £35,000 per annum, for a nanny and school costs for their daughter. In his judgment, Justice Bennett [...] stated: [...] "The husband's evidence was, in my judgment, balanced. He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation, if not anger. He was consistent, accurate and honest. But I <b>regret</b> <b>to</b> have to say I cannot say the same about the wife's evidence. Having watched and listened to her give evidence, having studied the documents, and having given in her favour every allowance for the enormous strain {{she must have been}} under (and in conducting her own case) I am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence, both written and oral, was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid. Overall, she was a less than impressive witness." [...] Regarding her career, the judge said: [...] "I find that, far from the husband dictating to and restricting the wife's career and charitable activities, he did the exact opposite. He encouraged it and lent his support, name and reputation to her business and charitable activities. The facts as I find them do not in any way support her claim." [...] In anger at the judgment, Mills threw a pitcher of water on the head of Fiona Shackleton, McCartney's solicitor, in the courtroom.|$|E
