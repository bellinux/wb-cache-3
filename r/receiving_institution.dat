50|$|Credit {{transfer}} between institutions considers transferability at {{an individual}} course level. In some cases, a course {{may be considered}} the same at the sending institution as {{it is at the}} <b>receiving</b> <b>institution</b> (the course is a transfer course). In other cases, a course is considered sufficiently similar or meets discipline requirements even though there is not an equivalent course at the <b>receiving</b> <b>institution</b> (the course is considered transferable).|$|E

40|$|This {{is about}} the {{transfer}} of academic credit to public, private non-profit, and private for-profit institutions. Students should know that all institutions establish their own transfer policies and that transfer policies are not prescribed by oversight agencies.

50|$|Institutions {{generally}} {{require a}} minimum satisfactory grade in each course taken. Students should check course equivalency maps and transfer guides to validate how courses in one institution will {{relate to the}} potential receiver institution. Even though prior courses may be comparable, {{it does not mean}} the <b>receiving</b> <b>institution</b> will count the course credit toward degree completion. Prior courses taken could either be accepted as electives, accepted as filling a degree requirement or not accepted at all.|$|E
50|$|The {{transcript}} {{and course}} evaluation {{process can be}} divided into three distinct stages which result in judgments independent of the student. First, an assessment {{of the quality of the}} course must be made. Second, the course must be evaluated on the basis of its comparability to courses at the <b>receiving</b> <b>institution.</b> Finally, the coursework for which credit is granted must be determined to be applicable to the program of study for which the student has applied.|$|E
50|$|College {{transfer}} {{often requires}} the determination {{and evaluation of}} prior course learning. Receiving institutions usually maintain course equivalency tables listing how courses equate by sender institution. Unless the <b>receiving</b> <b>institution</b> maintains an online public reference to the course equivalency tables, students have difficulty ascertaining transferbility of their credit experiences. As a result, student transitions from sender to receiver can be very problematic. This has led {{a number of states}} to initiate legislate reforms, regulations and mandates to augment the tracking of course equivalencies. A variety of statistics, studies, and initiatives have been documented (see References).|$|E

50|$|Evans, {{son of the}} Rev. Thomas Evans of Bassaleg, Monmouthshire, {{was born}} in 1755. He was matriculated at Merton College, Oxford, 16 December 1774, but left the {{university}} without a degree. In 1777 he was ordained by the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, his first curacy being that of Ashbury, Berkshire, where he served until 6 July 1778.

50|$|Chesapeake College {{participates in}} ARTSYS, a {{computerized}} data information system that helps ease {{the transfer of}} students from Maryland community colleges to all institutions within the University of Maryland system. ARTSYS allows students and advisors at the institutions to ascertain the transferability status of any community college course. It indicates whether the course is transferable and, if so, indicates the receiving institution’s equivalent course number or applicability towards elective credits. It also indicates the general education area(s), at both the sending and <b>receiving</b> <b>institutions,</b> applicable to the course.|$|R
50|$|Concrete {{determinations}} {{with regard}} to the three-part analysis described above can range in difficulty. Transfer professionals at institutions with significant transfers-in often have a course-by-course understanding of academic offerings of their sending institutions. This course-level understanding is typically arrived at through intensive reviews of course syllabi, textbooks and supplemental materials used in courses, knowledge of faculty and their qualifications at sending institutions, and lengthy consultations with departmental faculty at the <b>receiving</b> <b>institution</b> in connection with each course. Expensive and labor-intensive as sounds, this process represents the ideal method of course credit evaluation and decisions.|$|E
50|$|During college transfer, {{a student}} {{typically}} applies {{to a college}} or university as a prospective student. Different from traditional applicants, a transfer student's academic history is evaluated. This involves enrollment, transfer professionals and the faculty, and requires an in-depth analysis of every course taken by a student at another college or university and/or also including the evaluation of prior life experiences. A college transfer student applying to another college or university, must request academic transcripts from each institution they attended. Each potential <b>receiving</b> <b>institution</b> must wait until they receive the academic transcripts, assemble them by student and match them to the application.|$|E

50|$|For {{purposes}} of ensuring student success in handling {{the level of}} difficulty in the targeted academic program and the course work required of it, and protecting the integrity of academic credentials, all three judgments must be made for credit to be granted for the transfer student and to avoid having the student take the required courses as documented. Courses of poor quality, courses for which the <b>receiving</b> <b>institution</b> has no general counterpart, and courses that simply do not apply to the program of study being sought should not, and are not, typically counted toward degree requirements. This standard benefits students by ensuring that they are not inappropriately placed in programs of study and courses for which they are ill-prepared.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes a {{collector}} or institution {{will have a}} need to move objects outside of exhibit and storage locations. The collection management policy, which discusses the proper procedures for loans and acquisitions, must therefore also address proper packing and transport protocols {{to ensure that the}} objects arrive at their destination safely. To ensure safe transport, safe handling techniques must be combined with individual packing requirements for the specific object being shipped. Ideally, the object will be packaged in a shipping container that provides protection from shock, vibration, sudden climate changes, and mishandling. Collection management policies will advise staff on how best to address issues such as [...] "the object's fragility, the shipping method, the climate through which the objects will travel, and the climate at the object's destination." [...] During the packing and transport process, it is likely that several departments within the shipping institution may contribute, and collaboration with the <b>receiving</b> <b>institution</b> must be arranged to provide policies for acclimatization and unpacking of the object once received.|$|E
