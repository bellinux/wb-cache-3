40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} a fast {{forward and back}} projector pair based on inverse Fourier <b>rebinning</b> for use in iterative fully 3 D image reconstruction. The fast projector pair is used {{as part of a}} factored system matrix that models detector-pair response with a shift variant sinogram blur kernel. In this way we are able to combine the computational advantages of Fourier <b>rebinning</b> with iterative reconstruction using accurate system models. The forward projector uses the exact inverse <b>rebinning</b> equation to map stacked 2 D transaxial projections into a full 3 D sinogram. The back projector is simply the transpose of the forward projector and differs from the true exact <b>rebinning</b> operator {{in the sense that it}} does not require reprojection to compute missing lines of response (LOR). The inverse <b>rebinning</b> projector differs in performance by less than 1 % in RMS error from the fully 3 D geometric projector computed using solid angle calculations of voxel-wise sensitivity along each LOR. The cost of forward and back projection for the microPET Focus 220 small animal scanner using the inverse <b>rebinning</b> projector is 5 to 15 times less than that for the fully 3 D geometric projector, depending on the reconstructed field of view and voxel size. We compare performance between the inverse <b>rebinning</b> and 3 D geometric projectors using simulated point and phantom data and in vivo FDG mouse data. I...|$|E

Then, conventional 2 D reconstruction techniques are employed to obtain images from the <b>rebinned</b> data. In a common scenario, 2 D filtered back projection (FBP) is applied to Fourier <b>rebinned</b> (FORE) data. This approach is suboptimal because FBP is based on an idealized mathematical model of the data and cannot account for the statistical structure of data and noise. FORE data contain some blur in all three dimensions in comparison to conventional 2 D PET data.

40|$|Abstract—We {{describe}} a fast {{forward and back}} projector pair based on inverse Fourier <b>rebinning</b> for use in iterative image reconstruction for fully 3 -D positron emission tomography (PET). The projector pair is used {{as part of a}} factored system matrix that takes into account detector-pair response by using shift-variant sinogram blur kernels, thereby combining the computational advantages of Fourier <b>rebinning</b> with iterative reconstruction using accurate system models. The forward projector consists of a 2 -D projector, which maps 3 -D images into 2 -D direct sinograms, followed by exact inverse <b>rebinning</b> which maps the 2 -D into fully 3 -D sinograms. The back projector is implemented as the transpose of the forward projector and differs from the true exact <b>rebinning</b> operator {{in the sense that it}} does not require reprojection to compute missing lines of response (LORs). We compensate for two types of inaccuracies that arise in a cylindrical PET scanner when using inverse Fourier rebinning: 1) nonuniform radial sampling and 2) nonconstant oblique angles in the radial direction in a single oblique sinogram. We examine the effects of these corrections on sinogram accuracy and reconstructed image quality. We evaluate performance of the new projector pair for maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction of simulated and in vivo data. The new projector results in only a small loss in resolution towards the edge of the field-of-view when compared to the fully 3 -D geometric projector and requires an order of magnitude less computation.

40|$|Restricted until 5 Oct. 2009. Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) is a functional biomedical imaging technique that provides in vivo information about physiological processes {{within the body}} by reconstructing the 3 D distribution of a adiolabelled tracer. It is challenging to estimate the tracer distribution accurately since photon-limited PET data have high statistical variance. Statistical iterative reconstruction methods have shown uperior image quality and better quantitative results compared to analytical reconstruction methods. However, the iterative methods involve huge computational loads, particularly for fully 3 D PET, consequently limiting their routine use in practice. Clinical 3 D time-of-flight (TOF) PET scanners, which become available due to recent developments of fast scintillators, involve an even higher computational cost for image reconstruction because of extra TOF information. A successful pragmatic approach that reduces computation cost for fully 3 D PET is to use Fourier <b>rebinning</b> (FORE), reducing 3 D PET data to 2 D data, combined with a 2 D reconstruction method such as the ordered subsets expectation-maximization (OSEM) algorithm. The combination of FORE and 2 D OSEM is now routinely used in both clinical and small animal imaging systems. However, data dimensionality reduction using FORE {{can result in a}} loss in resolution or noise performance. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, we develop fast projectors that map a 3 D image into 3 D PET data by using the exact inverse (Fourier) <b>rebinning</b> operator. The inverse <b>rebinning</b> operator is used for calculating 3 D PET data from 2 D PET data, and combined with a 2 D projector to construct a fast 3 D projection operator. The inverse <b>rebinning</b> operator is implemented cost-effectively using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), so that the computation time is reduced by an order of magnitude. We utilize this fast projector in the context of fully 3 D PET maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction methods.; We reduced the reconstruction time substantially while retaining the resolution recovery properties. In the second part of this dissertation, we develop fast 3 D image reconstruction methods for TOF PET. We derive a unified framework based on a generalized projection slice theorem. In this framework, we derive mapping equations between different data sets such as 3 D TOF, 2 D TOF, 3 D non TOF and 2 D non TOF PET data. Using the mapping equations, we develop a TOF Fourier <b>rebinning</b> method which rebins 3 D TOF PET data to 2 D TOF data. We also develop other exact and approximate <b>rebinning</b> methods where 3 D TOF PET data are rebinned to 2 D or 3 D non TOF data.

30|$|To {{further reduce}} the size of the data sets, several papers have also {{described}} hybrid reconstruction methods. These methods reduce the data to 2 D data, which are then reconstructed by fast 2 D reconstruction algorithms. TOF-PET data contain redundant information, and several methods can be used to reduce the dimension of the datasets. One can re-bin the data into a lower dimensional format: 2 D TOF, 3 D non-TOF, or 2 D non-TOF [65]. Even <b>rebinning</b> to non-TOF sinograms, and using the conventional PET reconstruction, can be done with a significant preservation of the TOF gain in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [65]. The SSRB-TOF [23] is a very simple method, which uses the TOF information to determine the most likely slice and reduces the number of axial angles due to localized nature of TOF. The TOF information {{can also be used to}} reduce the number of transverse angles and mashes the 2 D data with a limited loss in information [25]. This <b>rebinning</b> can be done on-the-fly (without the intermediate step of 3 D sinograms) and is therefore also interesting to implement in hardware [66]. These methods can make use of Fourier-based projection techniques [67], which further reduce the reconstruction time and open up the possibility of hardware-based image reconstruction.

This paper presents an approach for finding and using the statistics of Fourier rebinned (FORE) data. In particular, utilizing a space domain representation of FORE, we find the approximate covariance matrix. We also derive an improved estimate of the mean of the rebinned data with a 2 -D forward projector that more accurately represents the effect of FORE on the original 3 -D PET measurements. In order to incorporate dependent information, we model the data conditioned on the image as a low-order Markov field.
