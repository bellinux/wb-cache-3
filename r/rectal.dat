5|$|Inside the pudendal canal, {{the nerve}} divides into branches, first giving off the {{inferior}} <b>rectal</b> nerve, then the perineal nerve, before continuing as the dorsal nerve of the penis (in males) or the dorsal nerve of the clitoris (in females).|$|E
5|$|The bulk of {{the water}} intake of Hemilepistus reaumuri is by taking up water vapour from {{saturated}} air and by eating damp sand. Water loss is minimised by the <b>rectal</b> epithelium, which absorbs water, ensuring that the faeces is drier than the food the animal consumed. Evaporation of water through the permeable exoskeleton may, however, provide a valuable cooling effect.|$|E
5|$|Transient {{increased}} bowel frequency, diarrhoea, constipation or minor <b>rectal</b> bleeding, {{may also}} occur. Acute and subacute side effects usually resolve over {{a matter of}} days or a few weeks. In the case of permanent (seed) brachytherapy for prostate cancer, there is a small chance that some seeds may migrate out of the treatment region into the bladder or urethra and be passed in the urine.|$|E
5|$|Drug {{collectors}} {{have certain}} traditions {{which may be}} accurate or may be exaggerated. Precautions are rightly taken when gathering hellebore, and men cannot dig it up for long; whereas the story that the peony must be dug up at night for fear that a woodpecker will watch and cause the man a <b>rectal</b> prolapse is a mere superstition. Similarly {{the idea that you}} must mark three circles around a mandrake plant with a sword, and speak of the mysteries of love while cutting it, is just far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Major Margaret Houlihan (Loretta Swit) and Major Frank Burns (Larry Linville) are eagerly {{awaiting}} the upcoming transfer of {{command of the}} 4077th MASH: upon Blake's departure, Burns will become the unit commander. Henry and Radar begin {{to clean out the}} main office, sharing a sentimental moment in which Radar tells Blake of his meaning to him. As a token of appreciation and admiration, Radar gives him an inscribed Winchester cartridge; a surprised Henry returns the favor by spontaneously giving Radar a <b>rectal</b> thermometer that once belonged to his father.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{analgesia}} is {{the cheapest}} and simplest mode of delivery. Other delivery routes such as sublingual, topical, transdermal, parenteral, <b>rectal</b> or spinal {{should be considered}} if the need is urgent, or in case of vomiting, impaired swallow, obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, poor absorption or coma. Current evidence for the effectiveness of fentanyl transdermal patches in controlling chronic cancer pain is weak but they may reduce complaints of constipation compared with oral morphine.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so <b>rectal</b> diazepam or (more recently) buccal midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV infection is less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and <b>rectal</b> irritation.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their <b>rectal</b> chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. They can do this because their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E
5|$|Mutations in the PRKACA {{gene that}} promote {{abnormal}} enzyme activity {{have been linked}} to disease of the adrenal gland. Several mutations in PRKACA have been found in patients with Cushing’s syndrome that result in an increase in the ability of PKA to broadly phosphorylate other proteins. One mutation in the PRKACA gene that causes an amino acid substitution of leucine to arginine in position 206, was found in over 60% of patients with adrenocortical tumors. Other mutations and genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene have been identified in adrenocortical adenomas that also disrupt PKA signaling, leading to aberrant PKA phosphorylation. The Cα gene has also been incriminated in a variety of cancers, including colon, renal, <b>rectal,</b> prostate, lung, breast, adrenal carcinomas and lymphomas.|$|E
25|$|Internal <b>rectal</b> {{intussusception}} (<b>rectal</b> intussusception, internal intussusception, internal <b>rectal</b> prolapse, occult <b>rectal</b> prolapse, internal <b>rectal</b> procidentia and <b>rectal</b> invagination) is {{a medical}} condition defined as a funnel shaped infolding of the <b>rectal</b> wall that can occur during defecation.|$|E
25|$|Solitary <b>rectal</b> ulcer {{syndrome}} (SRUS, SRU), is {{a disorder}} of the rectum and anal canal, caused by straining and increased pressure during defecation. This increased pressure causes the anterior {{portion of the}} <b>rectal</b> lining to be forced into the anal canal (an internal <b>rectal</b> intussusception). The lining of the rectum is repeatedly damaged by this friction, resulting in ulceration. SRUS can therefore {{considered to be a}} consequence of internal intussusception (a sub type of <b>rectal</b> prolapse), which can be demonstrated in 94% of cases. It may be asymptomatic, but it can cause <b>rectal</b> pain, <b>rectal</b> bleeding, <b>rectal</b> malodor, incomplete evacuation and obstructed defecation (<b>rectal</b> outlet obstruction).|$|E
25|$|<b>Rectal</b> {{prolapse}} {{often used}} to mean complete <b>rectal</b> prolapse (external <b>rectal</b> prolapse), where the <b>rectal</b> walls have prolapsed to a degree where they protrude out the anus and are visible outside the body. However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of <b>rectal</b> prolapse, depending on if the prolapsed section is visible externally, and if the full or only partial thickness of the <b>rectal</b> wall is involved.|$|E
25|$|Solitary <b>rectal</b> ulcer {{syndrome}} (SRUS, solitary <b>rectal</b> ulcer, SRU) {{occurs with}} internal <b>rectal</b> intussusception and {{is part of}} the spectrum of <b>rectal</b> prolapse conditions. It describes ulceration of the <b>rectal</b> lining caused by repeated frictional damage as the internal intussusception is forced into the anal canal during straining. SRUS can be considered a consequence of internal intussusception, which can be demonstrated in 94% of cases.|$|E
25|$|Patients with solitary <b>rectal</b> ulcer {{syndrome}} {{combined with}} internal intussusception (as 94% of SRUS patients have) {{were shown to}} have altered <b>rectal</b> wall biomechanics {{compared to patients with}} internal intussusception alone. The presumed mechanism of the obstructed defecation is by telescoping of the intussusceptum, occluding the <b>rectal</b> lumen during attempted defecation. One study analysed resected <b>rectal</b> wall specimens in patients with obstructed defecation associated with <b>rectal</b> intussusception undergoing stapled trans-anal <b>rectal</b> resection. They reported abnormalities of the enteric nervous system and estrogen receptors. One study concluded that intussusception of the anterior <b>rectal</b> wall shares the same cause as rectocele, namely deficient recto-vaginal ligamentous support.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rectal</b> mucosal {{prolapse}} (mucosal prolapse, anal mucosal prolapse) is a {{sub-type of}} <b>rectal</b> prolapse, and refers to abnormal descent of the <b>rectal</b> mucosa through the anus. It is different {{to an internal}} intussusception (occult prolapse) or a complete <b>rectal</b> prolapse (external prolapse, procidentia) because these conditions involve the full thickness of the <b>rectal</b> wall, rather than only the mucosa (lining).|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{external}} <b>rectal</b> prolapse, internal <b>rectal</b> intussusception is {{not visible}} externally, {{but it may}} still be diagnosed by digital <b>rectal</b> examination, while the patient strains as if to defecate. Imaging such as a defecating proctogram or dynamic MRI defecography can demonstrate the abnormal folding of the <b>rectal</b> wall. Some have advocated the use of anorectal physiology testing (anorectal manometry).|$|E
25|$|<b>Rectal</b> mucosal {{prolapse}} {{can be a}} {{cause of}} obstructed defecation (outlet obstruction). and <b>rectal</b> malodor.|$|E
25|$|The condition, {{along with}} {{complete}} <b>rectal</b> prolapse and internal <b>rectal</b> intussusception, {{is thought to}} be related to chronic straining during defecation and constipation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rectal</b> {{syndrome}} arises if {{the infection}} takes place via the <b>rectal</b> mucosa (through anal sex) and is mainly characterized by proctocolitis symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Mucosal {{prolapse}} can be differentiated from a full thickness external <b>rectal</b> prolapse (a complete <b>rectal</b> prolapse) by {{the orientation}} of the folds (furrows) in the prolapsed section. In full thickness <b>rectal</b> prolapse, these folds run circumferential. In mucosal prolapse, these folds are radially. The folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rectal</b> {{temperature}} {{can help}} ascertain if an infectious or inflammatory cause {{is to blame}} for the colic, which is suspected if the temperature if >103F. Temperature should be taken prior to <b>rectal</b> examination, as the introduction of air will falsely lower <b>rectal</b> temperature. Coolness of extremities can indicate decreased perfusion secondary to endotoxemia. Elevated respiratory rate can indicate pain as well as acid-base disturbances. A <b>rectal</b> examination, auscultation of the abdomen, and nasogastric intubation should always occur in addition to the basic physical exam.|$|E
25|$|FI {{may present}} with signs similar to <b>rectal</b> {{discharge}} (e.g. fistulae, proctitis or <b>rectal</b> prolapse), pseudoincontinence, encopresis (with no organic cause) and irritable bowel syndrome.|$|E
25|$|As with {{external}} <b>rectal</b> prolapse, {{there are a}} great many different surgical interventions described. Generally, a section of <b>rectal</b> wall can be resected (removed), or the rectum can be fixed (rectopexy) to its original position against the sacral vertebrae, or a combination of both methods. Surgery for internal <b>rectal</b> prolapse can be via the abdominal approach or the transanal approach.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} it {{represents}} the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external <b>rectal</b> prolapse. The intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of intussusception. The folding section of rectum can cause repeated trauma to the mucosa, and can cause solitary <b>rectal</b> ulcer syndrome. However, internal intussusception rarely progresses to external <b>rectal</b> prolapse.|$|E
25|$|Complications are uncommon, but include massive <b>rectal</b> bleeding, {{ulceration}} {{into the}} prostate gland or {{formation of a}} stricture. Very rarely, cancer can arise on the section of prolapsed <b>rectal</b> lining.|$|E
25|$|Some {{believe that}} {{internal}} <b>rectal</b> intussusception represents the initial {{form of a}} progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external <b>rectal</b> prolapse. The intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of intussusception. However, internal intussusception rarely progresses to external <b>rectal</b> prolapse. The factors that result in a patient progressing from internal intussusception to a full thickness <b>rectal</b> prolapse remain unknown. Defecography studies demonstrated that degrees of internal intussusception are present in 40% of asymptomatic subjects, raising {{the possibility that it}} represents a normal variant in some, and may predispose patients to develop symptoms, or exacerbate other problems.|$|E
25|$|Mucosal {{prolapse}} syndrome (MPS) {{is recognized}} by some. It includes solitary <b>rectal</b> ulcer syndrome, <b>rectal</b> prolapse, proctitis cystica profunda, and inflammatory polyps. It {{is classified as}} a chronic benign inflammatory disorder.|$|E
25|$|General {{surgeons}} treat a {{wide variety}} of major and minor colon and <b>rectal</b> diseases including inflammatory bowel diseases (such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), diverticulitis, colon and <b>rectal</b> cancer, gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhoids.|$|E
25|$|Intussusceptum {{refers to}} the {{proximal}} section of <b>rectal</b> wall, which telescopes into the lumen of the distal section of rectum (termed the intussuscipiens). What results is 3 layers of <b>rectal</b> wall overlaid. From the lumen outwards, the first layer is the proximal wall of the intussusceptum, the middle is {{the wall of the}} intussusceptum folded back on itself, and the outer is the distal <b>rectal</b> wall, the intussuscipiens.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rectal</b> {{prolapse}} {{may occur}} without any symptoms, but {{depending upon the}} nature of the prolapse there may be mucous discharge (mucus coming from the anus), <b>rectal</b> bleeding, degrees of fecal incontinence and obstructed defecation symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{involves}} {{antibiotics and}} may involve drainage of the buboes or abscesses by needle aspiration or incision. Further supportive measure {{may need to}} be taken: dilatation of the <b>rectal</b> stricture, repair of rectovaginal fistulae, or colostomy for <b>rectal</b> obstruction.|$|E
25|$|Solitary <b>rectal</b> ulcer syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Mucosal {{prolapse}} (partial <b>rectal</b> mucosal prolapse) {{refers to}} prolapse of the loosening of the submucosal attachments to the muscularis propria of the distal rectummucosal {{layer of the}} <b>rectal</b> wall. Most sources define mucosal prolapse as an external, segmental prolapse which is easily confused with prolapsed (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids (piles). However, both internal mucosal prolapse (see below) and circumferential mucosal prolapse are described by some. Others do not consider mucosal prolapse a true form of <b>rectal</b> prolapse.|$|E
25|$|Rectals are {{a risk to}} the practitioner, and {{the horse}} is ideally {{examined}} either in stocks or over a stall door to prevent kicking, with the horse twitched, and possibly sedated if extremely painful and likely {{to try to go}} down. Buscopan is sometimes used to facilitate <b>rectal</b> examination and reduce the risk of tears, because it decreases the smooth muscle tone of the gastrointestinal tract, but can be contraindicated and will produce a very rapid heart rate. Because the rectum is relatively fragile, the risk of <b>rectal</b> tears is always present whenever an examination is performed. Severe <b>rectal</b> tears often result in death or euthanasia. However, the diagnostic benefits of a <b>rectal</b> examination almost always outweigh these risks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rectal</b> and anal {{disease may}} be asymptomatic, or may present with pain when passing stools, fresh blood in stool, {{a feeling of}} {{incomplete}} emptying, or pencil-thin stools. In addition to regular tests, medical tests used to investigate the anus and rectum include the digital <b>rectal</b> exam and proctoscopy.|$|E
