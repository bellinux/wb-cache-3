It examines the sourcing experiences of four firms in four different countries in the automotive industry and identifies the raw <b>material</b> <b>sourcing</b> knowledge-related parameters. Synthesizing the findings from these case studies, it proposes {{the concept of the}} sourcing hub—a collaborative center involving the firm, its suppliers, and raw material suppliers—which can effectively capture and deploy the raw <b>material</b> <b>sourcing</b> knowledge for managing value in upstream sourcing...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve stable and {{sustainable}} systems for recycling post-consumer goods, it is frequently necessary to concentrate the flows from many collection points to meet the volume requirements for the recycler. This motivates the importance of growing the collection network over time to both meet volume targets and keep costs to a minimum. This research addresses a complex and interconnected set of strategic and tactical decisions that guide the growth of reverse supply chain networks over time. This dissertation has two major components: a tactical recruitment model and a strategic investment model. These capture the two major decision levels for the system, the former for the regional collector who is <b>responsible</b> for recruiting <b>material</b> <b>sources</b> to the network, the latter for the processor who needs to allocate his scarce resources over time and to regions to enable the recruitment to be effective. The recruitment model is posed as a stochastic dynamic programming problem. An exact method and two heuristics are developed to solve this problem. A numerical study of the solution approaches is also performed. The second component involves a key set of decisions on how to allocate resources effectively to grow the network to meet long term collection targets and collection cost constraints. The recruitment problem appears as a sub-problem for the strategic model and {{this leads to a}} multi-time scale Markov decision problem. A heuristic approach which decomposes the strategic problem is proposed to solve realistically sized problems. The numerical valuations of the heuristic approach for small and realistically sized problems are then investigated. Ph. D. Committee Co-Chair: Jane C. Ammons; Committee Co-Chair: Matthew J.

In {{order to}} study the raw <b>material</b> <b>sources</b> and their identification methods of blue and white porcelain made in Jingdezhen Jiajing official kiln (J-O-kiln) and Dehua Housuo kiln (D-H-kiln), 22 blue and white porcelain samples of J-O-kiln and D-H-kiln were analyzed for their body and glaze chemical compositions by Proton Induced X-Ray Emission (PIXE). A set of fingerprint chemical components among them were selected for distribution analysis. Our {{results show that the}} raw <b>material</b> <b>sources</b> the porcelain bodies of J-O-kiln are relatively concentrated, and those of D-H-kiln porcelain bodies are relatively scattered, and the raw <b>material</b> <b>sources</b> of porcelain bodies made in the two kilns are quite different, and the raw <b>material</b> <b>sources,</b> recipes of the transparent glazes and blue and white glazes made in these two kilns are also quite different.

40|$|In 1982, the Utah State University Museum of Anthropology {{received}} a donation of nearly 2, 000 archaeological artifacts {{from a local}} collector. This collection, known as the ‘Bud’ Peterson Collection (accession number 82. 01), contains primarily precontact artifacts including lithic, ceramic, faunal, and perishable materials. Often the case with avocational collections, little to no site location information or context is recorded with the artifacts. What little provenience information exists with the ‘Bud’ Peterson Collection is general and fails to specify to which artifacts it refers. In an attempt to determine relative provenience and to assess assemblage characteristics for the collection’s ceramics, we employ x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry to conduct a raw <b>material</b> <b>source</b> analysis (i. e., mineralogical and elemental compositions). Archaeological theory concerning precontact pottery suggests that the construction, use, transportation, and disposal of prehistoric pottery occur in relative proximity to its raw <b>material</b> <b>sources.</b> Operating under this assumption, x-ray spectrometry should reveal a relative provenience designation for the collection’s pottery artifacts based off of the geographical distribution and availability of their raw <b>material</b> <b>sources.</b> Here, we discuss {{the results of the}} x-ray spectrometric analyses and how these results inform upon determining relative provenience designations for the ‘Bud’ Peterson Collection...|$|R
