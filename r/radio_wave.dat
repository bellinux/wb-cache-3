25|$|When a <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> {{reaches the}} ionosphere, the {{electric}} {{field in the}} wave forces the electrons in the ionosphere into oscillation at the same frequency as the <b>radio</b> <b>wave.</b> Some of the radio-frequency energy is given up to this resonant oscillation. The oscillating electrons will then either be lost to recombination or will re-radiate the original wave energy. Total refraction can occur when the collision frequency of the ionosphere {{is less than the}} radio frequency, and if the electron density in the ionosphere is great enough.|$|E
25|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>wave</b> {{diffraction}} is {{the scattering}} of radio frequency or lower frequencies from the Earth's ionosphere, {{resulting in the}} ability to achieve greater distance radio broadcasting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Temporal {{correlation}} between atmospheric anomalies and earthquakes has re-cently been veried statistically through measuring VHF FM <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> transmitted beyond the line-of-sight. In order {{to locate the}} sources of such atmospheric anomalies, we developed a VHF in-terferometer system (bistatic-radar type) capable of nding the arrival direction of FM <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> scattered possibly by earthquake-related atmospheric anomalies. In general, frequency modulation of FM <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> produces ambiguity of arrival direction. However, our system, employing high-sampling rates {{of the order of}} kHz, can precisely measure the arrival direction of FM <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> by stacking received signals...|$|R
25|$|The cutoff {{frequency}} is the frequency below which a <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> fails to penetrate {{a layer of}} the ionosphere at the incidence angle required for transmission between two specified points by refraction from the layer.|$|E

25|$|An exotic {{variant of}} this <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> {{propagation}} has been examined to show that, theoretically, the ionospheric bounce could be greatly exaggerated if a high powered spherical acoustical wave {{were created in}} the ionosphere from a source on earth.|$|E
5000|$|Small antennas {{around one}} {{wavelength}} in size, such as quarter-wave monopoles and half-wave dipoles, don't have much directivity (gain); they are omnidirectional antennas which radiate <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> {{over a wide}} angle. To create a high gain antenna, which radiates <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> in a narrow beam, two general techniques can be used. One technique is to use large metal surfaces such as parabolic reflectors, horns or dielectric lenses which change {{the direction of the}} <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> by reflection or refraction, to focus the <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> from a single low gain antenna into a beam. This type is called an aperture antenna.|$|R
40|$|Around fifty LORAN (LOng RAnge Navigation) {{transmitters}} in {{the northern}} hemisphere currently launch continuously pulsed 100 kHz <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> into the Earth's atmosphere for marine navigation. It is discovered that the 100 kHz <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> from the LORAN transmissions can be detected by the DEMETER satellite {{at an altitude of}} similar to 660 km above the transmitters. These novel electric field measurements in space enable the determination of the nocturnal transionospheric attenuation by comparison with ground based electric field measurements. The electric field measurements on the satellite indicate that the nocturnal transionospheric attenuation of 100 kHz <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> from LORAN transmissions is equivalent to a nocturnal subionospheric attenuation of the 100 kHz <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> at a distance of similar to 7 - 9 Mm. The <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> exhibit an average subionospheric attenuation of similar to 5 dB/Mm and it is concluded that the nocturnal transionospheric attenuation of 100 kHz <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> is similar to 35 - 45 dB. This result enables future space missions to quantify the intensity of lightning discharges associated with transient luminous events and terrestrial g-ray flashes...|$|R
5000|$|A {{horn antenna}} {{is used to}} {{transmit}} <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> from a waveguide (a metal pipe used to carry <b>radio</b> <b>waves)</b> out into space, or collect <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> into a waveguide for reception. It typically consists of a short length of rectangular or cylindrical metal tube (the waveguide), closed at one end, flaring into an open-ended conical or pyramidal shaped horn on the other end. [...] The <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> are usually introduced into the waveguide by a coaxial cable attached to the side, with the central conductor projecting into the waveguide to form a quarter-wave monopole antenna. The waves then radiate out the horn end in a narrow beam. In some equipment the <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> are conducted between the transmitter or receiver and the antenna by a waveguide; {{in this case the}} horn is attached {{to the end of the}} waveguide. In outdoor horns, such as the feed horns of satellite dishes, the open mouth of the horn is often covered by a plastic sheet transparent to <b>radio</b> <b>waves,</b> to exclude moisture.|$|R
25|$|Because water {{molecules}} absorb microwaves and other <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> frequencies, {{water in the}} atmosphere attenuates radar signals. In addition, atmospheric water will reflect and refract signals to an extent that depends on whether it is vapor, liquid or solid.|$|E
25|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} (RFA), {{which is}} conceptually analogous {{in some ways}} to surgery, uses low frequency (300kHz to 1MHz) <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> energy to target tissue, causing coagulative necrosis. RFA achieves its effects at 40°C to 70°C unlike other electrosurgical devices which require 400°C to 600°C for efficacy.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>waves</b> {{were first}} {{predicted}} by mathematical {{work done in}} 1867 by the boys. Maxwell noticed wavelike properties of light and similarities in electrical and magnetic observations. His mathematical theory, now called Maxwell's equations, described light <b>waves</b> and <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> as waves of electromagnetism that travel in space, radiated by a charged particle as it undergoes acceleration. In 1887, Heinrich Hertz demonstrated the reality of Maxwell's electromagnetic waves by experimentally generating <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> in his laboratory, showing that they exhibited the same wave properties as light: standing waves, refraction, diffraction, and polarization. <b>Radio</b> <b>waves,</b> originally called [...] "Hertzian waves", were first used for communication in the mid 1890s by Guglielmo Marconi, who developed the first practical radio transmitters and receivers.|$|R

25|$|Far field methods achieve longer ranges, often {{multiple}} kilometer ranges, {{where the}} distance {{is much greater}} than the diameter of the device(s). The main reason for longer ranges with <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> and optical devices is the fact that electromagnetic radiation in the far-field can be made to match the shape of the receiving area (using high directivity antennas or well-collimated laser beams). The maximum directivity for antennas is physically limited by diffraction.|$|E
25|$|In telecommunications, {{frequency}} modulation (FM) conveys information over a carrier wave by varying its frequency. While {{working in the}} basement laboratory of Columbia's Philosophy Hall, Edwin Armstrong invented wide-band {{frequency modulation}} radio in 1933. Rather than varying the amplitude of a <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> to create sound, Armstrong's method varied {{the frequency of the}} wave instead. FM radio broadcasts delivered a much clearer sound, free of static, than the AM radio dominant at the time. Armstrong received a patent on wideband FM on December 26, 1933.|$|E
5000|$|Radio {{sounders}} {{from the}} ground can bounce <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> of varying frequency off the ionosphere, and by timing their return determine the electron density profile—up to its peak, past which <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> no longer return. Radio sounders in low Earth orbit aboard the Canadian Alouette 1 (1962) and Alouette 2 (1965), beamed <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> earthward and observed the electron density profile of the [...] "topside ionosphere". Other radio sounding methods were also tried in the ionosphere (e.g. on IMAGE).|$|R
5000|$|The {{transmitter}} module for each antenna element contains a phase shifter which {{can change the}} phase (relative timing) of the oscillating current applied to the antenna, under control of the central computer. Due to the phenomenon of interference, the <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> from each separate transmitting antenna element combine (superimpose) {{in front of the}} antenna to produce a beam of <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> (plane waves) traveling in a specific direction. By altering the relative phase of the <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> emitted by the individual antennas, the computer can instantly steer the beam to a different direction.|$|R
50|$|Some {{energy is}} also lost {{from the system}} as a whole and from the arc as a broad {{spectrum}} of electromagnetic radiation, in the form of <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> and light. These <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> can cause undesirable clicks and pops on nearby radio receivers.|$|R
25|$|The Rayleigh {{criterion}} {{dictates that}} any <b>radio</b> <b>wave,</b> microwave or laser beam will spread and become weaker and diffuse over distance; {{the larger the}} transmitter antenna or laser aperture compared to the wavelength of radiation, the tighter the beam and the less it will spread {{as a function of}} distance (and vice versa). Smaller antennae also suffer from excessive losses due to side lobes. However, the concept of laser aperture considerably differs from an antenna. Typically, a laser aperture much larger than the wavelength induces multi-moded radiation and mostly collimators are used before emitted radiation couples into a fiber or into space.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{applications}} of the Tesla coil circuit was in early radio transmitters called spark gap transmitters. The first <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> generators, invented by Heinrich Hertz in 1887, were spark gaps connected directly to antennas, powered by induction coils. Because they lacked a resonant circuit, these transmitters produced highly damped radio waves. As a result, their transmissions occupied an extremely wide bandwidth of frequencies. When multiple transmitters were operating {{in the same area}} their frequencies overlapped and they interfered with one another, causing garbled reception. There was no way for a receiver to select one signal over another.|$|E

50|$|<b>Radio</b> <b>waves</b> are {{a type of}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel {{at the speed of}} light. Naturally occurring <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> are made by lightning, or by astronomical objects. Artificially generated <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> are used for fixed and mobile radio communication, broadcasting, radar and other navigation systems, satellite communication, computer networks and innumerable other applications. Different frequencies of <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> have different propagation characteristics in the Earth's atmosphere; long waves may cover a part of the Earth very consistently, shorter waves can reflect off the ionosphere and travel around the world, and much shorter wavelengths bend or reflect very little and travel on a line of sight.|$|R
5000|$|In {{telecommunications}} and electronics, an antenna feed {{refers to the}} components of an antenna which feed the <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> {{to the rest of}} the antenna structure, or in receiving antennas collect the incoming <b>radio</b> <b>waves,</b> convert them to electric currents and transmit them to the receiver. Antennas typically consist of a feed and additional reflecting or directive structures (such as a parabolic dish or parasitic elements) whose function is to form the <b>radio</b> <b>waves</b> from the feed into a beam or other desired radiation pattern.|$|R
25|$|The antenna {{converts}} {{the energy}} in the electromagnetic radio waves to an alternating electric current in the antenna, which {{is connected to the}} tuning coil. Since in a crystal radio all the power comes from the antenna, {{it is important that the}} antenna collect as much power from the <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> as possible. The larger an antenna, the more power it can intercept. Antennas of the type commonly used with crystal sets are most effective when their length is close to a multiple of a quarter-wavelength of the radio waves they are receiving. Since the length of the waves used with crystal radios is very long (AM broadcast band waves are 182-566 m or 597–1857ft. long) the antenna is made as long as possible, from a long wire, in contrast to the whip antennas or ferrite loopstick antennas used in modern radios.|$|E
500|$|Microwave heating {{technologies}} {{are based on}} the same principles as <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> heating, although it is believed that <b>radio</b> <b>wave</b> heating is an improvement over microwave heating because its energy can penetrate farther into the oil shale formation. [...] The microwave heating process was tested by Global Resource Corporation. [...] Electro-Petroleum proposes electrically enhanced oil recovery by the passage of direct current between cathodes in producing wells and anodes located either at the surface or at depth in other wells. The passage of the current through the oil shale formation results in resistive Joule heating.|$|E
