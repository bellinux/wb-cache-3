40|$|AbstractLand {{scarcity}} {{made the}} Indonesian government decided to develop low cost flats {{to solve the}} problem for housing the urban poor rather than ground bound single housing (Kementrian PU, 2012). Not all houses offered to the relocated households have shown to be widely accepted (ADB, 2003). They were difficult to expand as changing family circumstances dictated. Adaptations to meet the changed users’ requirements involve demolition and result in waste generation which is detrimental to sustainable development (Friedman, 2007). Through activity based analysis, this research aimed to evaluate adaptability of space due to sustainable living in the low cost housing in Indonesia. For this, 300 families of all 14 low cost <b>rental</b> <b>apartment</b> locations were investigated as the total of <b>apartment</b> <b>units</b> in Surabaya was 3459, therefore 21 - 27 units of each location were taken as sample. Result shows that for functionality, all unit parts of low cost <b>rental</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>units</b> in Surabaya, except the balcony, were provided only between 50 % and 55 % of the standard. For adaptability, only by the installation of a mezzanine, that fully covering the area of multi-functional space can fulfil the use of space except Tanah-Merah as this upward adaptation could double the area of existing space. The changing capacity for corridor occupation is found to be 1. 11, while for the installation of half area mezzanine is 1. 5, and for the changing of balcony to a bedroom is 1. 16 on average. However, Penjar- 3 and I. T. S. could not allow their top spaces as liveable space because their unit height is just 2. 65 m...|$|R

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The price of a real estate depends on its location. In China, an urban high-rise typically includes multiple dwellings, which share the same characteristics such as the age of the estate, the neighborhood amenities, and the surrounding environments, etc. First, with price series of Shanghai's residential housing market during the period 2003 - 2005, we develop three hedonic pricing models by incorporating district dummies, proxy variables like the distance to CBD and the teacher student ratios, and estate fixed effect respectively to control for location (and neighborhood) fixed effect. We find that estate dummy variables provide us with small enough location classification and allow us to better examine the differentiation across properties. Second, in China an urban complex of high-rise buildings (estates) typically includes <b>rental</b> <b>apartment</b> <b>units</b> and owner-occupied units of similar quality. We use the rent data for inference of estate-specific fixed effect, which in turn helps to estimate the unobserved rent of a unit sold in the same real estate property. With data of two major cities in China, Shanghai and Shenzhen, we develop a Bayesian approach to conduct joint finite-sample inference of price and rent, and analyze the factors that determine the price-to-rent ratios of the units sold. A crucial feature of our rent-based pricing model lies in its heterogeneity across properties. We detect that the estate-fixed effect is the dominating factor of the cross-estate mean of the price-to-rent ratio and an important source of the cross-unit variations in the ratio...|$|R
40|$|The {{textbook}} graphical {{analysis of}} price control (see Figure 1) is inappropriate any {{time there is}} substantial consumer heterogeneity. In cases such as <b>rental</b> <b>apartments,</b> where one <b>unit</b> is usually the maximum bought per customer, and the downward slope of the demand function comes exclusively from consumer heterogeneity, this analysis misses a primary source of welfare loss. A major social cost of rent control is that without a fully operational price mechanism the 'wrong' consumers end up using apartments. When prices are set below market price, many consumers want to rent apartments even though they receive little utility from those apartments. Unless apartments are somehow allocated perfectly across consumers, rental units will be allocated to consumers who gain little utility from renting and rental units will not go to individuals who desire them greatly. The social costs of this misallocation are first order when the social costs from underprovision of housing are second order. Thus for a sufficiently marginal implementation of rent control, these costs will always {{be more important than}} the undersupply of housing. Figure 2 shows the losses graphically. ...|$|R
