40|$|The <b>Rogowski</b> <b>Loop</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} basic {{diagnostics}} for tokamak operations. On the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX), the plasma current <b>Rogowski</b> <b>Loop</b> had the constraints of the very limited space available on the center stack, 5, 000 volt isolation, flexibility requirements as it remained a part of the Center Stack assembly after the first phase of operation, and a + 120 C temperature requirement. For the second phase of operation, four Halo Current Rogowski Loops under the Center Stack tiles will be installed having + 600 C and limited space requirements. Also as part of the second operational phase, up to ten Rogowski Loops will installed to measure eddy currents in the Passive Plate support structures with + 350 C, restricted space, and flexibility requirements. This presentation will provide the details of the material selection, fabrication techniques, testing, and installation results of the Rogowski Loops that were fabricated for the high temperature operational and bakeout requirements, high voltage isolation requirements, and the space and flexibility requirements imposed upon the Rogowski Loops. In the future operational phases of NSTX, additional Rogowski Loops could be anticipated that will measure toroidal plasma currents in the vacuum vessel and in the Passive Plate assemblies...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} is to study {{the changes in the}} redox potential and pH-value of the tap water as a function of underwater spark discharges, storage device capacitance and the charging voltage. Methodology. To define the electric parameters of discharge circuit we used the <b>Rogowski</b> <b>loop</b> and the compensated capacitance-ohm potential divider. To determine water properties before and after the treatment we used the following devices: the water analyzer Anion - 7051 with the limit of absolute error of the EMF measurement ± 2 mV, the BANTE 902 device with the absolute error of ± 0. 002 рН. Results. We managed to establish the time of the origination of changes in the properties of treated water. A change in the positive redox potential to a negative one occurred already after the third pulse at a total energy input of ≥ 1 kJ. The pH value increased in the range of 0. 2 – 0. 45 рН units. We obtained the relationship of a change in the redox potential as a function of total energy of the pulse train that actually exhibits the linear relation to the mass of erosion products. We established that the electrodes made of stainless steel and the electrodes made of graphite provide similar changes in water properties. An increase in pH is indicative of the progress of reactions that result in the formation of ОН‾. Originality. The obtained experimental data prove a rapid and reliable change in the redox potential from positive to negative changes in the redox potential exponent can persist during ten days and even longer. The erosion products of electrodes can be removed from the treated water using the method of magnetic separation. Practical value. The «HYDRA» plant can be used as the electrochemical ideal mixing reactor of a discrete action with the removal of erosion products of the electrode using the method of magnetic separation...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} the more than 300 in-vessel sensor systems for the National Spherical Torus Experiment (NSTX) has {{encountered}} several challenging fusion reactor diagnostic issues involving high temperatures and space constraints. This has resulted in unique miniature, high temperature in-vessel sensor systems mounted in small spaces behind plasma facing armor tiles, and they are prototypical of possible high power reactor first-wall applications. In the Center Stack, Divertor, Passive Plate, and vessel wall regions, the small magnetic sensors, large magnetic sensors, flux <b>loops,</b> <b>Rogowski</b> Coils, thermocouples, and Langmuir Probes are qualified for 600 degrees C operation. This rating will accommodate both peak rear-face graphite tile temperatures during operations and the 350 degrees C bake-out conditions. Similar sensor systems including flux loops, on other vacuum vessel regions are qualified for 350 degrees C operation. Cabling from the sensors embedded in the graphite tiles follows narrow routes to exit the vessel. The detailed sensor design and installation methods of these diagnostic systems developed for high-powered ST operation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Wendelstein 7 -X (W 7 -X), a modular {{advanced}} stellarator, {{is presently}} under construction at the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Greifswald. Part {{of the inner}} plasma vessel (PV) surface is covered by graphite tiles which are bolted onto water-cooled CuCrZr heat sink plates. This so-called heat shield shall protect in-vessel components and the PV wall from plasma-edge-radiation and convective heat loads. Numerous diagnostics (e. g. Diamagnetic <b>loops,</b> <b>Rogowski</b> coils, etc.) are located in between the heat shield and plasma vessel wall. They are loaded by thermal radiation from the hot heat shield backside, stray radiation from the electron cyclotron resonance heating (ECRH), and plasma radiation through remaining gaps between the tiles. In {{order to keep the}} temperatures of the diagnostics within their specified limits, additional shielding is required. The paper presents the design of such a shielding for the diamagnetic <b>loops</b> and <b>Rogowski</b> coils. Several options of copper shields and loosely attached Sigraflexr-layers, and combinations thereof, are compared with respect to their abilities to reduce the temperatures of the sensitive parts of the diagnostics. To increase the confidence in the results, a sensitivity study with widely varying radiative material properties has been carried out. The advantages and disadvantages of the potential solutions are discussed. As a result two copper shield variants which also reduce the load onto the plasma vessel are presented...|$|R
