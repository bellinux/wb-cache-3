40|$|Abstract: Recent {{advances}} in mobile and wireless technology have made possible {{new types of}} information systems supporting key activities in transport organizations. By including mobile actors and equipment, such technology is a key enabler for realizing the vision of enterprise system support in this context. This paper focuses on {{a particular type of}} transport organization, that of <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> firms. The term Transport Information Systems (TIS) is used to discuss a specific type of enterprise technology, incorporating support for critical mobile aspects of <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> firms and relevant functionality of conventional enterprise systems. To capture expectations of enterprise support in <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> business, a qualitative interview study including 18 Swedish <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> firms was performed. Building on the results of the study, this paper contributes a set of sociotechnical challenges important for successful implementation of TIS in <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> firms. In addition, this paper outlines implications for future research on enterprise systems in transport organizations. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Road</b> <b>haulage</b> {{operations}} in general, and distribution in particular, are inefficient. Given the societal importance of <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> {{and the low}} efficiency of the sector, road hauliers need to improve their operations and systematically tackle inefficiencies. However, the real causes of these inefficiencies, the “root causes”, have not been sufficiently examined in previous studies. This paper expands on prior research by adapting existing models {{that can be used}} to identify the root causes of inefficiencies, and to enable systematic improvements in road transport operations. Our research is based on a lean approach and an adapted version of Ishikawa’s model. It is shown as a matrix based on transport processes and the Ishikawa categories to identify the root causes of inefficiencies in <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> that influence performance. The adapted model was tested in three <b>road</b> <b>haulage</b> case studies. Our findings suggest that most efficiency problems appear in the actual transport execution...|$|R
