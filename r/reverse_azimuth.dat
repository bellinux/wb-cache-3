40|$|PKP {{precursor}} wave trains from twelve large earthquakes, {{in the distance}} range 128 " to 142 " from the Warramunga seismic array in northern Australia, have been processed digitally. Direct measurements of average slowness of sections of the wave trains are presented and compared with calculations based on a theoretical analysis of seismic wave scattering by Haddon. On {{the basis of this}} comparison, we interpret our results as offering strong support to the suggestion that the precursors result from the scattering of P K P waves by random irregularities near the base of the mantle. This conclusion is supported by evidence from analyses of <b>reverse</b> <b>azimuth</b> arrivals from Novaya Zemlya explosions (A = 106 ") and amplitude characteristics along {{precursor wave}} trains. Unconventional array processing techniques were used in the analysis of amplitude variations. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A pure mode II (in-plane) {{shear crack}} cannot {{propagate}} sponta-neously {{at a speed}} between the Rayleigh and S-wave speeds, but a three-di-mensional (3 D) or two-dimensional (2 D) mixed-mode shear crack can propagate in this range, being driven by the mode Ill (antiplane) component. Two different analytic solutions have been proposed for the mode II component in this case. The first is the solution valid for crack speed less than the Rayleigh speed. When applied above the Rayleigh speed, it predicts a negative stress intensity factor, which implies that energy is generated at the crack tip. Burridge proposed a second solution, which is continuous at the crack tip, but has a singularity in slip velocity at the Rayleigh wave. Spontaneous propagation of a mixed-mode rupture has been calculated with a slip-weakening friction law, in which the slip velocity vector is colinear with the total traction vector. Spontaneous trans-Ray-Ieigh rupture speed has been found. The solution depends on the absolute stress level. The solution for the in-plane component {{appears to be a}} superposition of smeared-out versions of the two analytic solutions. The proportion of the first solution increases with increasing absolute stress. The amplitude of the negative in-plane traction pulse is less than the absolute final sliding traction, so that total in-plane traction does not <b>reverse.</b> The <b>azimuth</b> of the slip velocity vector varies rapidly between the onset of slip and the arrival of the Rayleigh wave. The variation is larger at smaller absolute stress...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} and describes a prototype product code-named SolT 2 A {{which is a}} system that tracks the position of the sun automatically across the celestial vault in two axes. This kind of system is typically used in a solar photovoltaic (PV) system in terrestrial applications to provide electrical power. It is designed and fabricated due to Malaysiaâ€™s location near the equator, thus the solar altitude crosses the zenith and the <b>azimuth</b> <b>reverses</b> direction during the year. Thus the use of a static PV system is not maximised during half of the year. This situation can be addressed by using a two-axes solar tracking system. So far, Malaysia has not implemented such powertracking systems. Thus SolT 2 A has been designed and fabricated to address the problem by using a combination of electro-mechanical devices with an element of programming ingenuity and intelligence. Basically SolT 2 A measures solar irradiance at four points and makes comparisons in terms of the intensity received. These data are then analysed and processed by a controller before being sent to a DC motor that ensures the maximum amount of solar irradiance received on the PV panels all the time. Thus SolT 2 A {{is a system that}} maximises the power output of the PV panels to obtain the highest power output continuously. Based on field data, the maximum output open circuit voltage produced by the SolT 2 A tracking system and that with a static PV system is as much as 82...|$|R
