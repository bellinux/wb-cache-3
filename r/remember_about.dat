500|$|In the {{regional}} finals, Kentucky trailed top-seeded Duke by 12 {{in the second}} half, but battled back to force overtime. With 2.1 seconds left in overtime, Sean Woods hit a running bank shot to put Kentucky up one. Then, Duke's Christian Laettner caught a long inbounds pass, faked right, and hit {{a shot at the}} buzzer to give Duke the 104103 victory. The game, which ended Farmer's playing career, is widely {{regarded as one of the}} greatest college basketball games of all time. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski later recalled, [...] "The thing I'll always <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> that game is Richie Farmer's face as the ball went in. That, to me, helped me to have a better understanding of that game. ... To me, that was the deepest emotion that was on the court, the emotion that was on Richie Farmer's face." [...] Describing the impact of the game, Jerry Tipton wrote, [...] "On one fateful night, the Cats obliterated any lingering association with $1,000 packages and academic fraud. Alluring images of courage, honest effort and heartracing excitement became symbols of UK basketball." [...] Local media gave the seniors the nickname [...] "The Unforgettables".

2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{issue in}} the study of the emotion-memory relationship is whether our emotions are influenced by our behavioral reaction to them, and whether this reaction—in the form of expression or suppression of the emotion—might affect what we <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> an event. Researchers have begun to examine whether concealing feelings influences our ability to perform common cognitive tasks, such as forming memories, and found that the emotion regulation efforts do have cognitive consequences. In the seminal work on negative affect arousal and white noise, Seidner found support for the existence of a negative affect arousal mechanism through observations regarding the devaluation of speakers from other ethnic origins." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the run of}} the series, {{the rivalry}} between Alexis and Krystle is a primary driver for the melodrama. Alexis resents Krystle's role as Blake's wife and as {{mistress}} of the Carrington household, and tries to undermine her at every opportunity, while Krystle makes increasingly bold efforts to keep Alexis from interfering in the lives of their mutual loved ones. The pair have numerous verbal spats that sometimes led to physical altercations. [...] "Unfortunately, the thing people <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> this show is the catfights," [...] noted Collins in 1991. Krystle and Alexis famously brawl {{for the first time in}} Alexis's studio and then later in a lily pond. They also hurl mud at each other at a beauty salon, and slide down a ravine together into a puddle of mud, before having their final showdown brawl in a fashion studio in the 1991 miniseries [...] Later in the series, Alexis also has a catfight with Blake's half-sister Dominque (Diahann Carroll), and then fights her own cousin Sable (Stephanie Beacham). She even has a brawl with her on-again, off-again lover and one-time husband, Dex (Michael Nader). Sammy Jo (Heather Locklear) also has her fair share of catfights, as she first engages in a slap fight with Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) before taking on Amanda (Catherine Oxenberg) in a brawl in a swimming pool. Sammy Jo then later fights Fallon (Emma Samms) in a horse trough and the mud around it. Evans even battles with herself at the climax of a 1985–1986 storyline in which Krystle is imprisoned and replaced by a lookalike named Rita (also played by Evans); Krystle ends up battling Rita in order to escape. In 2008, Entertainment Weekly termed Alexis and Krystle's catfights [...] "the gold standard of scratching and clawing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alex. Ştefănescu {{agrees with}} Negoiţescu's own {{belief in the}} book's {{narrative}} qualities, arguing that Straja dragonilor is, after Poezia lui Eminescu, [...] "the best of all that this feverish and uneven author has ever written". The same commentator commends the volume it for displaying a form of sincerity that was ultimately [...] "conquered through culture {{and the experience of}} writing", resulting in [...] "another level" [...] of a memoir. He writes: [...] "All is beautiful in Ion Negoiţescu's autobiography, even that which is ugly. [...] A reader who is purely spurred on by a prosaic curiosity will find himself disappointed and will abandon it (like the sexually obsessed will abandon a book by Freud)." [...] In Pârvulescu's view: [...] "Although they break all sorts of taboos, [...] Negoiţescu's memoirs are so well written that they never veer into vulgarity or obscenity." [...] Likewise, Adriana Stan esteemed the book [...] "singular in our literature" [...] and its author's [...] "capital work". Also according to Ştefănescu, readers who follow the account of young Negoiţescu's spontaneous sexual act at the cinema will sympathize with the protagonist, and even [...] "breathe a sigh of relief" [...] to note that his advances were not rejected. The same reviewer finds another outstanding quality of the book in [...] "the vast depiction of emotional states", which he believes comparable to sections of Marcel Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. In one such fragment, he argues, Negoiţescu presents him child self as [...] "a strange Pygmalion", helping his own mother get dressed for a ball and obsessing over every detail in her appearance. The [...] "Proustian" [...] nature is also highlighted by Stan, who argues: [...] "the recollection performed by the grownup ego has therefore too little in common with a regular, constructed and directed writer's diary." [...] Additionally, Pârvulescu sees an essential quality of the book in its depiction of Transylvania as both a prolongation of Austria-Hungary's [...] "decadent greatness" [...] and an area of Balkan and Levantine echoes, [...] "the Ischler cookies on the same table as the qatayef." [...] A section of Straja dragonilor is based strictly on an inventory of Negoiţescu's genealogy, with insight into his family history. The segment is however deemed [...] "boring" [...] by Ştefănescu, who notes that the names mentioned [...] "do not mean anything to us", but nevertheless acknowledges the [...] "chill" [...] they evoke: [...] "the writer, alerted by the premonition of death, wishes to save [...] all things that he can <b>remember</b> <b>about</b> his forefathers." ...|$|E
