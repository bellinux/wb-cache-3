5000|$|Cork oak forests: {{are found}} in low and medium {{elevations}} with mild winters and relatively high rainfall (600 to 800 mm), often on soils formed over siliceous <b>rocks.</b> <b>Cork</b> oak—(Quercus suber) forests are found on the coastal plains between Casablanca and the Rif Mountains in northern Morocco, and several areas further inland around the Rif and Middle Atlas ranges. They also found on along the Tell Atlas of northern Algeria, and in the Kroumerie and Mogod mountain ranges of northwestern Tunisia.Cork oak (Quercus suber) is the predominant tree, accompanied by a rich mix of evergreen small trees and large shrubs, including bay laurel - (Laurus nobilis), strawberry tree - (Arbutus unedo), tree heath—(Erica arborea), holly—(Ilex aquifolium), Phillyrea spp. (Phillyrea angustifolia and Phillyrea latifolia), Laurustinus—(Viburnum tinus), hairy broom—(Cytisus villosus), and common myrtle—(Myrtus communis).|$|R

50|$|Rubyhorse were a <b>rock</b> {{band from}} <b>Cork,</b> Ireland. Their debut album, A Lifetime In One Day, was {{released}} in Ireland on 2 June 1995. In 1997 the band moved to Boston, Massachusetts, and all of their subsequent albums were released in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Lotería is the Spanish {{word for}} lottery. The deck is {{composed}} {{of a set of}} 54 different images, each one in a card. To start the game, the caller (cantor, or singer) randomly selects a card from the deck and announces it to the players by its name, sometimes using a riddle or humorous patter instead of reading the card name. The players with a matching pictogram on their board mark it off with a chip or other kind of marker (many Mexican people traditionally use small <b>rocks,</b> crown <b>corks</b> or pinto beans as markers). The first player with four chips in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row, squared pattern,any other previously specified pattern, or fills the tabla first shouts [...] "¡Lotería!" [...] (Lottery!) or [...] "¡Buenas!" [...] (Good!) and is the winner.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the winter}} of 1980/81, another teak-tough National Hurling League {{campaign}} brought the team further on. At Nowlan Park on April 19, 1981, 14-man Offaly held out for a 2-13 to 4-6 League Semi-final win against Laois, after another cliffhanger of hard close pulling. Pat Delaney lofted in a free that Paddy Kirwan sent to the net for what proved the decisive score, despite a furious Laois onslaught in the dying minutes. Some 19,000 spectators came to Thurles on May 3 for the League Final itself. Offaly won the toss and opted to play against the wind and hail - only to be <b>rocked</b> by <b>Cork's</b> opening salvo of two goals and three points. Offaly effected a tremendous fightback, holding the Rebels scoreless for the last 14 minutes, but they had left themselves with too steep a climb. Cork took the League Title by 3-11 to 2-8.|$|R
50|$|Rest are an {{instrumental}} <b>rock</b> group from <b>Cork,</b> Ireland. The group's sound {{has evolved over}} the course of their existence to incorporate elements of progressive rock, tech-metal, post-rock, doom, black metal and math rock. The groups sound is characterised by intricate harmonised riffs, complex drum patterns, unconventional song structures, a heavy emphasis on dynamics and alternating time signatures. As well as releasing one album and an EP on Limerick independent record label Out on a Limb Records, the band has also toured Ireland and the United Kingdom, sharing stages with the likes of Isis, Cult of Luna, Oxbow, Baroness, Torche, Zu, Red Sparowes and Explosions in the Sky.|$|R
6000|$|It {{would seem}} that engineers, as well as doctors, are apt to differ. Some {{suggested}} that each particular stone should be floated to the <b>rock,</b> with a <b>cork</b> buoy attached to it; while others proposed an air-tank, instead of the cork buoy. Others, again, proposed to sail over the rock at high water in a flat-bottomed vessel, and drop the stones one after another when over the spot they were intended to occupy. A few, still more eccentric and daring in their views, suggested that a huge cofferdam or vessel should be built on shore, and {{as much of the}} lighthouse built in this as would suffice to raise the building above the level of the highest tides; that then it should be floated off to its station on the rock, which should be previously prepared for its reception; that the cofferdam should be scuttled, and the ponderous mass of masonry, weighing perhaps 1000 tons, allowed to sink at once into its place! ...|$|R
50|$|On 20 November 1986, she {{anchored}} in Bantry Bay, Republic of Ireland after developing deck cracking {{in one of}} her frames during her Atlantic crossing. She was forced to leave port after losing her anchor and damaging her steering gear to avoid colliding with an oil tanker also {{anchored in}} Bantry Bay. Royal Air Force helicopters rescued the crew and the Kowloon Bridge was effectively abandoned with her engine running astern, heading away from the Irish coast. A tugboat that tried to reach her had to abandon the salvage attempt after she too sustained storm damage. The wind turned her around and she headed back towards the coast, nearly entering Baltimore Bay when her propeller hit the rocks, stalling the engine. Within hours, Kowloon Bridge drifted east and ran aground on a submerged reef near The Stags <b>rocks</b> off West <b>Cork</b> in the Republic of Ireland. The resulting fuel spilt out over the Irish coastline causing extensive damage to local wildlife, and financial losses for the local fishing fleet. In the spring of 1987, Kowloon Bridge split into three sections and sank.|$|R
40|$|Small {{scattered}} disseminations of metalliferous minerals, primarily copper bearing sulphides {{and secondary}} malachite, are {{widespread in the}} Upper Devonian sedimentary <b>rocks</b> of South-West <b>Cork.</b> This mineralization is spatially associated {{with the development of}} 'red beds'. Typically the host rocks are the sandstone and comstone fractions of green-grey coloured strata. In the 'red bed' sequence such greon-grey strata are present as thin concordant bands. An upward stratigraphic zoning of the sulphides from those rich in copper to those relatively rich in iron occurs. In addition the sulphides show evidence of having been deformed together with the enclosing host rocks during the Ilercynian orogeny. The copper abundances in unmineralized portions of the succession are apparently abnormally lev. Similar though less richly mineralised cupriferous strata occur in the Devonian succession elsewhere in Southern Ireland and in the Anglo-Welsh area. The disseminated mineralisation is considered to have formed as a result of diagenetic processes active within the coinpacting sedimentary column. The position of the water table, the presence of sulphate-reducing) bacteria, the movement of 'waters of compaction', variations in sediment permeability and the presence both of 'red beds' and of the adjacent Variscan marine eeosynclinal basin are considered to have bean important factors in effecting metal concentration. In South-West Cork the subsequent Hercynian orogeny produced small quartz-sulphide veins by lccal renobilization of cupriferous country rock. Larger vein deposit of quartz, of baryte, and of manganese and iron oxides also occur. Where quarts forms a major constituent, metalliferous (chiefly Cu-Pb) mineralization is common. It is suggested that in the main such metalliferous mineralization vas emplaced during the Hercynian orogeny from remnant connate fluids channelled through fractures after the surrounding strata were rendered impermeable. The baryte and the manganese and iron oxides may have been deposited at a much later stage from ground waters circulating in the pre-existing Eercynian fractures. Various microscopic sulphide textures present in the mineralization of the South-West Cork area are, in addition, described and their modes of formation discussed...|$|R
