40|$|The most {{significant}} limitations in lithium-ion battery technology for high voltage, personal transportation power (HEVs or PHEVs) are safety issues. While great advances {{have been made}} in the safety of cathode and anode active materials, considerable challenges remain with electrolyte and separator safety under field failure and abuse failure modes. Conventional hexafluorophosphate/carbonate electrolytes can degrade under normal use and abuse conditions to generate large volumes of gas, primarily CO 2. 1 Pressurization of a closed system and venting aerosolized flammable solvents present significant hazards to these systems. Moreover, separator failure due to an internal short circuit, localized heating, or breakdown resulting from a high <b>stand-off</b> <b>voltage</b> can be extremely energetic and can lead t...|$|R
40|$|A radial {{multichannel}} pseudospark switch {{is integrated}} into a plasma focus system disigned to generate soft x rays to determine switch durability in a long-term test. The operating parameters correspond to a repetition rate of up to 2 Hz, <b>stand-off</b> <b>voltages</b> of 10 kV and peak currents of 200 kA. Only minimal electrode erosion is witnessed after a serial test of 180 000 shots where the electrode surfaces are inspected after every 25 000 shots. The good condition of electrode surfaces suggests {{the possibility of an}} additional 200 000 shots, implying that for the given parameter range the lifetime of the multichannel pseudospark is at least four times longer than that of traditional high-current switches such as spark gaps. In a comparative test the performance of the multichannel pseudospark switch is evaluated against a multichannel spark gap. The results of these investigations show that the low-erosive pseudospark is well suited to substitute for apark gaps in high-current applications...|$|R
40|$|Low-temperature (LTO) {{chemical}} vapor deposited (CVD) dbxide {{was investigated}} {{for use as}} an insulator material in microfabricated ion engine accelerator grids. Both substrate (bulk) as well as surface breakdown experiments were performed. Oxide thicknesses for substrate breakdown tests ranged between 1 pm and 3. 9 pm. Surface breakdowns were performed over gap distances ranging between 5 pm and 600 pm. Substrate breakdown strengths up to 600 - 700 V/pm were measured, allowing for maximum <b>stand-off</b> <b>voltages</b> of 2500 V. A slight decrease in breakdown field strength for larger thicknesses was observed. Temperature effects on substrate breakdown field strengths do exist, however, are small. Only a 15 % drop in breakdown field strength was noted at 400 C vs. strengths measured at room temperature. Surface breakdown field strengths ranged as high as 260 V/pm, leading to a stand-off capability of 700 V over a 5 pm oxide film. Tests were performed to study the influence of silicon oxide surface morphology on the surface breakdown strength and none was found. I...|$|R

50|$|At {{the middle}} of the {{junction}} of the p-n material, a depletion region is created to <b>stand-off</b> the <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage.</b> The width of the depletion region grows larger with higher voltage. The electric field grows as the reverse voltage increases. When the electric field increases beyond a critical level, the junction breaks down and current begins to flow by avalanche breakdown. Therefore, care must be taken that circuit voltages do not exceed the breakdown voltage or electrical isolation ceases.|$|R
40|$|Stainless steels {{are widely}} used in thermal power plant, {{pressure}} vessels and automobiles components due to their superior fracture toughness, good inter granular corrosion resistance and non-requirement of post process annealing. Heat affected zone decreases {{the strength of the}} weld hence Pulsed TIG welding process is carried out to reduce the heat affected zone. This inherent property of the material reduces crack growth at high pressure which leads to the increase in efficiency of the pressure vessels and automobile components, when operated at high pressure. This paper describes the optimization of process parameters like current, <b>voltage,</b> <b>stand-off</b> distance, pulse on time, pulse off time and weld speed, gas flow to improve weld quality. In this work Taguchi method is used to get the optimal parameters. In Taguchi method, L 27 orthogonal array is used for experimentation. Further, the experimental values and the various settings of the process parameters are fed as input to Taguchi and hence the S/N ratio values are obtained. Weld speed and input current are found to be the most significant parameters. Finally, the strength of the weld is validated by tensile and bending test...|$|R
40|$|An ion {{cyclotron}} {{range of}} frequencies (ICRF) probe [F. W. Baity, G. C. Barber, V. Bobkov, R. H. Goulding, J. -M. Noterdaeme, D. W. Swain, in: 14 th Topical Conference on Radiofrequency Power in Plasmas, Oxnard 2001, AIP Conference Proceedings 595, AIP, Melville, NY, 2001, p. 510] has been implemented to study <b>voltage</b> <b>stand-off</b> of the ICRF antennas on ASDEX Upgrade (AUG). The probe was operated at {{first in a}} test stand where features of high RF voltage operation in vacuum and plasma created by an ion source of the Hall type [Plasma Sources Sci. Technol. 8 (1999) R 1] were studied. Vacuum arcs as well as ignition of high voltage glow discharge are candidate processes to explain voltage limits of the ICRF antennas. The setup on AUG was used to expose high RF voltages in real conditions of the tokamak scrape-off layer which are faced by the ICRF antennas. It is found that high voltage breakdown on the ICRF antenna is often correlated with ELM activity. The maximal RF voltage increased from shot to shot, i. e. the conditioning effect is observed. For the good-conditioned ICRF probe it was shown experimentally that the voltage limit can be increased while the rectified current is suppressed at the same time...|$|R
40|$|A {{collaborative}} effort between European research Associations and Thales Electron Devices (TED) has been {{launched by the}} European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA) in 2003, aiming at {{the development of an}} industrial 170 GHz/ 2 MW/CW coaxial cavity gyrotron. The first prototype is expected to reach 2 MW/ 1 s and is presently being tested in Lausanne at a dedicated test facility. The test facility has been designed to be flexible: allowing the possible commissioning of tubes with different characteristics, as well the tests of a version of the ITER upper launcher antenna at full performances. The test facility has been commissioned during the first test phases on the gyrotron which include: high <b>voltage</b> <b>stand-off,</b> coaxial insert alignment and cathode conditioning without depressed collector power supply at a slightly reduced electron beam power of 85 kV/ 78 A/ 2 ms. The short pulse (< 5 ms) operation of the gyrotron has demonstrated stable single mode operation in the designed TE- 34, 19 mode at RF power levels in excess of 1. 4 MW, at below nominal electron beam parameters (79 kV/ 75 A). Further RF optimization in view of reaching the nominal beam parameters of 90 kV/ 75 A is presently underway and the status of the short pulse (< 100 ms) experimental results will be reported. ©IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Plasma heating using compressional Alfvén waves ["fast waves" (FWs) ] in the ion {{cyclotron}} {{range of}} frequencies is a well-established technique in magnetic confinement devices and {{is part of}} the ITER day-one heating systems. The large plasma/FW antenna distance foreseen for ITER implies a light antenna load resistance, which will necessitate an antenna rf <b>voltage</b> <b>stand-off</b> near the upper end of what has been demonstrated in experiments. In view of the uncertainties in the far scrape-off layer density profiles in ITER, a crucial point is the rate of decay of the antenna loading as the plasma/antenna distance is increased. In this work, detailed measurements of the resistive and reactive components of the FW antenna loading in DIII-D are compared with predictions from the TOPICA code and from simple slab models of the edge plasma region. Edge density profiles measured with X-mode reflectometers are used in the code calculations. The loading obtained in dynamic scans of the plasma/antenna distance under both L- and H-mode conditions is compared with TOPICA calculations, and very good absolute agreement between the measured and predicted loading is obtained without any adjustable parameters in the TOPICA model. These results indicate that a quantitative understanding of the FW coupling process is in hand, given a precise knowledge of the edge density profiles. Consequently, TOPICA may be used to optimize ICRF antenna design...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} on plasma of the antennas {{of the proposed}} ITER ICRF system is evaluated {{by means of the}} antenna 24 × 24 impedance matrix provided by the TOPICA code and confirmed and interpreted by the semi-analytical code ANTITER II (summarized in an appendix). From this analysis the following system characteristics can be derived: (1) a roughly constant power capability in the entire 40 - 55 MHz frequency band with the same maximum voltage in the eight feeding lines is obtained for all the considered heating and current drive phasings on account of the broadbanding effect of service stubs. (2) The power capability of the array significantly depends on the distance of the antenna to the separatrix, the density profile in the scrape-off layer (SOL) and on the strap current toroidal and poloidal phasings. The dependence on phasing is stronger for wider SOL. (3) To exceed a radiated power capability of 20 MW per antenna array in {{the upper part of the}} frequency band, with a separatrix-wall distance of 17 cm and a conservative short decay plasma edge density profile, the system <b>voltage</b> <b>stand-off</b> must be 45 kV and well chosen combinations of toroidal and poloidal phasing are needed. (4) On account of the plasma gyrotropy and of poloidal magnetic field, special care must be taken in choosing the optimal toroidal current drive and poloidal phasings. The ANTITER II analysis shows furthermore that important coaxial and surface mode excitation can only be expected in the monopole toroidal phasing, that strong wave reflection from a steep density profile significantly reduces the coupling even if the separatrix is closer to the antenna and that the part of the edge density profile having a density lower than the cut-off density pertaining to the considered phasing does not significantly contribute to the couplin...|$|R
40|$|Coupling of ICRF (ion {{cyclotron}} {{range of}} frequencies) {{power to the}} plasma {{is one of the}} standard methods to heat plasmas in toroidal devices with magnetic confinement. However voltage limits on the ICRF antenna used to launch the waves sometimes lead to a limitation of the power. These limits are related to a variety of high voltage breakdown phenomena in the presence of plasma that depend, in particular, on spatial charge effects and particle fluxes to the electrodes. An ICRF probe has been developed to study the high voltage phenomena. The open end of a coaxial line models the high voltage region of the antenna. The voltage limits were studied in well defined conditions in a test facility without magnetic field and in the real conditions of the peripheral plasma of the ASDEX Upgrade divertor tokamak. The ICRF probe was installed in the test facility and conditioned in vacuum by high power pulses to reliable operation with 60 kV, 200 ms or 80 kV, 20 ms pulses. During the conditioning, vacuum arcs occur mainly at the probe head. The arcs appear often when dark field emission currents are measured. The presence of a plasma density of 10 " 1 " 5 m"-" 3 (delivered by a high aperture ion source) does not affect the <b>voltage</b> <b>stand-off</b> of the probe unless the pressure of working gas is increased beyond a critical level: a semi-self-sustained glow discharge is ignited at a pressure of 0. 15 Pa for He and 0. 03 Pa for air. These pressures are about one order of magnitude lower than the pressures required for ignition of a self-sustained glow discharge at 80 kV. Cathode spots {{on the surface of the}} inner conductor are formed in the semi-self-sustained discharge and often lead to the formation of the arc discharge. (orig.)
