From the late 18th century until just after WW1, silk processing {{was an important}} industry for Evercreech, a spillover from mills at nearby Bruton and Sherborne. The workforce for the village's three silk factories was made up almost entirely of young women and girls, some of whom started working as young as {{seven or eight years}} of age. Fulfilling orders from London, two of the factories were throwing mills which produced high quality spun <b>silk</b> <b>thread.</b> The third mill wove <b>silk</b> <b>thread</b> into cloth. Bales of <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> were imported to the mills from France, Italy, and India by London merchants [...] Employment in the mills was erratic, driven by highly volatile demand for English woven silk. This volatility, in turn was caused by embargoes on imported woven silk, duty taxes, and then the lifting of import restrictions in 1860.|$|R

25|$|Silk is {{produced}} year-round in Thailand by {{two types of}} silkworms, the cultured Bombycidae and wild Saturniidae. Most production is after the rice harvest in the southern and northeastern parts of the country. Women traditionally weave silk on hand looms and pass the skill on to their daughters, as weaving {{is considered to be}} a sign of maturity and eligibility for marriage. Thai silk textiles often use complicated patterns in various colours and styles. Most regions of Thailand have their own typical <b>silks.</b> A single <b>thread</b> filament is too thin to use on its own so women combine many threads to produce a thicker, usable fiber. They do this by hand-reeling the threads onto a wooden spindle to produce a uniform strand of <b>raw</b> <b>silk.</b> The process takes around 40 hours to produce a half kilogram of silk. Many local operations use a reeling machine for this task, but some <b>silk</b> <b>threads</b> are still hand-reeled. The difference is that hand-reeled threads produce three grades of silk: two fine grades that are ideal for lightweight fabrics, and a thick grade for heavier material.|$|R

5000|$|Commercial {{breeding}} of Lepidoptera {{has a long}} history. The Bombyx mori (Latin: [...] "silkworm of the mulberry tree"), The practice of breeding silkworms {{for the production of}} <b>raw</b> <b>silk,</b> also known as Sericulture, has been underway for at least 5,000 years in China. It is dependent on humans for its reproduction and does not occur naturally in the wild. The silkworm was domesticated from the wild silkmoth Bombyx mandarina which ranges from northern India to northern China, Korea, Japan, and the far eastern regions of Russia. The domesticated silkworm derives from Chinese rather than Japanese or Korean stock. Silkworms were unlikely to have been domestically bred before the Neolithic age; before then, the tools required to facilitate the manufacturing of larger quantities of <b>silk</b> <b>thread</b> had not been developed. The domesticated B. mori and the wild B. mandarina can still breed and sometimes produce hybrids.|$|R
40|$|Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> {{was never}} {{renowned for its}} high quality, yet it {{attracted}} {{the interest of the}} European trading companies from the seventeenth century. This thesis explores the English East India Company’s silk manufacturing activities in Bengal and the Company’s trade in Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> in the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries. The Company’s interest in Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> was driven both by economic and political factors – profit maximization and mercantilist ideas about governance. The English East India Company considered Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> to be an item with potential high returns as the British silk weaving industry required supplies of raw material unavailable domestically. However, the quality of the Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> was low and it could not be easily used in British weaving. Britain thus relied on the importation of <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> from Italy, Turkey and the Mediterranean region. The English East India Company saw an opportunity to replace these supplies with silk imported from Bengal. In order {{to improve the quality of}} the <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> produced in Bengal, the Company decided to adopt the Piedmontese system of silk reeling – the most advanced reeling system in Europe. The thesis shows that this new system of reeling was profitable. Yet, the quality of the Bengal <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> did not improve as much as expected: a large part of the silk produced was of substandard quality. My thesis argues that the primary reason why substandard <b>raw</b> <b>silk</b> was produced was the inadequate institutional framework of production which facilitated principal-agent problems...|$|R
