5|$|Debt service {{funds are}} used to account for money {{that will be used}} to pay the {{interest}} and principal of long-term debts. Bonds used by a government to finance major construction projects, to be paid by tax levies over a period of years, require a debt service fund to account for their repayment.

A further court hearing resulted in the election being conducted in-person <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>by</b> mail, which also led to Giron complaining of voter suppression.|$|E

5|$|Extracts of the puffball {{have strong}} {{antitumor}} activity in mouse models attributable to protein-bound polysaccharides, the compounds calvatan, craniformin, and a tautomer of rubroflavin. Calvatan {{is thought to}} act by stimulating the immune response, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>by</b> killing cells. Craniformin, originally reported in 1997, is an azoformamide compound. Three sterol compounds have been identified from the fungus: ergosta-4,6,8(14), 22-tetraene-3-one, ergosta-7,22-diene-3-ol, and ergosterol peroxide.|$|E

This {{magnetic field}} is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>by</b> an internal dynamo as in the Earth's core. Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation.|$|E

By 2000, {{the threat posed by}} cross-border rebels was much reduced and when Bizimungu resigned, Kagame decided to seek the presidency himself. The transitional constitution was still in effect, which meant the president was elected by government ministers and the national assembly <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>by</b> a direct election.|$|E

For the 2015 election, this {{changed to a}} hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members {{as a result of}} a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013.
