Therefore, Patellifolia is of great interest as Crop wild relative and potential gene donor. They seem to be resistant {{to some of the most}} serious diseases of sugar beets, to leaf spot disease caused by Cercospora beticola, curly top virus, rhizomania, and powdery mildew (Erysiphe polygoni). All three species proved to be highly resistant to the Beet cyst eelworm (Heterodera schachtii). The three species differ in their <b>resistance</b> <b>level,</b> whereas Patellifolia patellaris is not completely immune, but eelworms never develop to maturity in the other two species.|$|E
2500|$|... lyophilizing and wire-heating {{process is}} another method of {{creating}} longitudinally oriented channels, developed by Huang et al. (2005). A chitosan and acetic acid solution was frozen around nickel-copper (Ni-Cu) wires in a liquid nitrogen trap; subsequently the wires were heated and removed. Ni-Cu wires were chosen {{because they have}} a high <b>resistance</b> <b>level.</b> Temperature-controlled lyophilizers were used to sublimate the acetic acid. There was no evidence of the channels merging or splitting. After lyophilizing, scaffold dimensions shrunk causing channels to be a bit smaller than the wire used. The scaffolds were neutralized to a physiological pH value using a base, which had dramatic effects on the porous structure. Weaker bases kept the porous structure uniform, but stronger base made it uncontrollable. The technique used here can be slightly modified to accommodate other polymers and solvents.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a microstructural {{explanation for the}} success of two familiar predictions from technical analysis: 1) trends tend to be reversed at predictable support and <b>resistance</b> <b>levels,</b> and 2) trends gain momentum once predictable support and <b>resistance</b> <b>levels</b> are crossed.; The explanation is based on a close examination of stop-loss and take-profit orders at a large foreign exchange dealing bank. Take-profit orders tend to reflect price trends, and stop-loss orders tend to intensify trends. The requested execution rates of these orders are strongly clustered at round numbers, which are often used as support and <b>resistance</b> <b>levels.</b> Significantly, there are marked differences between the clustering patterns of stop-loss and take-profit orders, and between the patterns of stop-loss buy and stop-loss sell orders.

40|$|Numerous {{studies show}} efflux as a {{universal}} bacterial mechanism contributing to antibiotic resistance and also that {{the activity of the}} antibiotics subject to efflux can be enhanced by the combined use of efflux inhibitors. Nevertheless, the contribution of efflux to the overall drug <b>resistance</b> <b>levels</b> of clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is poorly understood and still is ignored by many. Here, we evaluated the contribution of drug efflux plus target-gene mutations to the drug <b>resistance</b> <b>levels</b> in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. A panel of 17 M. tuberculosis clinical strains were characterized for drug resistance associated mutations and antibiotic profiles in the presence and absence of efflux inhibitors. The correlation between the effect of the efflux inhibitors and the <b>resistance</b> <b>levels</b> was assessed by quantitative drug susceptibility testing. The bacterial growth/survival vs. growth inhibition was analyzed through the comparison between the time of growth in the presence and absence of an inhibitor. For the same mutation conferring antibiotic resistance, different MICs were observed and the different <b>resistance</b> <b>levels</b> found could be reduced by efflux inhibitors. Although susceptibility was not restored, the results demonstrate the existence of a broad-spectrum synergistic interaction between antibiotics and efflux inhibitors. The existence of efflux activity was confirmed by real-time fluorometry. Moreover, the efflux pump genes mmr, mmpL 7, Rv 1258 c, p 55, and efpA were shown to be overexpressed in the presence of antibiotics, demonstrating the contribution of these efflux pumps to the overall resistance phenotype of the M. tuberculosis clinical isolates studied, independently of the genotype of the strains. These results showed that the drug <b>resistance</b> <b>levels</b> of multi- and extensively-drug resistant M. tuberculosis clinical strains are a combination between drug efflux and the presence of target-gene mutations, a reality that is often disregarded by the tuberculosis specialists in favor of the almost undisputed importance of antibiotic target-gene mutations for the resistance in M. tuberculosis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Over 90 % of {{antibiotics}} for human use in Europe are prescribed in primary care. We assessed the congruence between primary care treatment guidelines for skin infections and commensal Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) antimicrobial <b>resistance</b> <b>levels</b> in community-dwelling persons. Methods: The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in S. aureus was analysed by taking nose swabs from healthy primary care patients in nine European countries (total N = 32, 032). Primary care treatment guidelines for bacterial skin infections were interpreted {{with respect to}} these antimicrobial resistance patterns. First- and second-choice recommendations were assessed and considered congruent if resistance to the antibiotic did not exceed 20 %. Results: We included primary care treatment guidelines for impetigo, cellulitis, folliculitis and furuncle. Treatment recommendations in all countries were consistent: most of the first-choice recommendations were beta-lactams, both for children and adults. Antimicrobial <b>resistance</b> <b>levels</b> were low, except for penicillin (on average 73 % resistance). Considerable variation in antimicrobial <b>resistance</b> <b>levels</b> was found between countries, with Sweden displaying the lowest levels and Spain the highest. In some countries resistance to penicillin and azithromycin was significantly higher in children (4 - 17 years) compared with adults. Conclusions: Most of the first- and second-choice recommendations in the treatment guidelines for skin infections were congruent with commensal S. aureus antimicrobial resistance patterns in the community, except for two recommendations for penicillin. Given the variation in antimicrobial <b>resistance</b> <b>levels</b> between countries, age groups and health care settings, national data regarding antimicrobial resistance in the community {{should be taken into}} account when updating or developing primary care treatment guidelines.

40|$|Extended-spectrum ß-lactamases (ESBLs) emerge by point {{mutation}} from non-extended-spectrum precursors. The aims {{of this study}} were to reveal the basis for variations in <b>resistance</b> <b>levels</b> found in a collection of 21 Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates from Brisbane, Australia. Previous studies have shown that 20 of these isolates possess blaSHV- 11, blaSHV- 2 a, and/or blaSHV- 12, and there is an association between the copy numbers of the ESBL-encoding genes and <b>resistance</b> <b>levels.</b> In this study, a real-time PCR method for interrogating the polymorphic sites at codons 238 and 240 was developed, and this confirmed the relationship between mutant gene copy numbers and <b>resistance</b> <b>levels.</b> The blaSHV promoter region was cloned from one of the ESBL-expressing isolates, and this showed that blaSHV genes exist downstream of two different promoters within this single isolate. These promoters have both been reported previously, and they differ by virtue of {{the presence or absence of}} an IS 26 insertion. The blaSHV copy numbers in cis with the different promoters were measured, and the copy number of the IS 26 promoter was correlated with <b>resistance</b> <b>levels.</b> Cloning and analysis of PCR products showed that different blaSHV variants existed in cis with individual promoters in individual isolates but that mutant genes were more abundant downstream of the IS 26 promoter. There were no ESBL-positive isolates without this promoter. It was concluded that blaSHV in cis with the IS 26 promoter is located on an amplifiable replicon, and the presence of the IS 26 insertion may facilitate the acquisition of an ESBL-positive phenotype...|$|R

The reliability of a rapid, automated approach to testing methicillin-resistant staphylococci was evaluated. To determine the accuracy in detecting oxacillin-methicillin resistance by the AutoMicrobic system, 746 staphylococci from seven different geographical areas were tested. Results were compared with the Bauer-Kirby agar disk diffusion technique as the reference method. Of the 304 staphylococci, 209 coagulase-positive and 95 coagulase-negative strains were resistant to oxacillin-methicillin. These organisms fell into three categories of resistance detection.
