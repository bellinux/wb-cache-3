40|$|There {{are many}} {{distinct}} differences (morphologic, physiologic, and mechanical) between the bird's lung-air-sac respiratory {{system and the}} mammalian bronchoalveolar lung. In this paper, we review the physiology of the avian respiratory system with attention to those mechanisms {{that may lead to}} significantly different results, relative to those in mammals, following exposure to toxic gases and airborne particulates. We suggest that these differences can be productively exploited to further our understanding of the basic mechanisms of inhalant toxicology (gases and particulates). The large mass-specific gas uptake by the avian respiratory system, at rest and especially during exercise, could be exploited as a sensitive monitor of air quality. Birds have much to offer in our understanding of <b>respiratory</b> <b>toxicology,</b> but that expectation can only be realized by investigating, {{in a wide variety of}} avian taxa, the pathophysiologic interactions of a broad range of inhaled toxicants on the bird's unique respiratory system...|$|E
40|$|Although the air {{we breathe}} is {{necessary}} for life, certain factors may make this same air detrimental to our health. For instance, a seemingly endless list of compounds can be toxic at certain concentrations, and inhaling such compounds may lead to damage {{in different parts of the}} body. To investigate the particular effects of inhaled toxicants, the NIEHS developed the <b>Respiratory</b> <b>Toxicology</b> Group. The group, which consists of toxicologist Dan Morgan, biologist Cassandra Shines, and engineer Michael Moorman, has been conducting experiments for about a decade at the NIEHS inhalation facility. Morgan says the group typically conducts studies of chemicals that have been nominated to the National Toxicology Program for investigation into their carcinogenic potential and other end points. "We provide research support and conduct special studies on these chemicals," he says. "We also do collaborative studies with other NIEHS investigators, other [federal] agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy, universities, and industry. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It is {{an urgent}} {{priority}} to establish in vivo bioassays for detection of hazards related to fine particles, {{which can be}} inhaled into deep lung tissue by humans. In order to establish an appropriate bioassay for detection of lung damage after particle inhalation, several experiments were performed in rats using quartz as a typical lung toxic particle. The results of pilot experiments suggest that Days 1 and 28 after intratracheal instillation of 2 mg of fine test particles in vehicle are most appropriate for detection of acute and subacute inflammatory changes, respectively. Furthermore, the BrdU incorporation on Day 1 and the iNOS level on Day 28 proved to be suitable end-point markers for this purpose. An examination of the toxicity {{of a series of}} particles was performed with the developed bioassay. Although some materials, including nanoparticles, demonstrated toxicity that was too strong for sensitive assessment, a ranking order could be clarified. The bioassay thus appears suitable for rapid hazard identification with a possible ranking of the toxicity of various particles at single concentrations.

40|$|Defense of the Lungs? The {{involvement}} of the pulmonary surfactant system {{in defense of the}} alveoli and distal airways of the lungs is an aspect of <b>respiratory</b> physiology and <b>toxicology</b> that has been largely overlooked. The pulmonary surfactant system is absolutely critical to survival of all mammalian species, as progressive loss of surfactant leads to lung collapse and death of the organism. In recent years it has been noticed that under certain circumstances, especially those involving the inhalation of dust, the lungs may respond by increasing the production of surfactant. The purpose of this reaction is unclear although it seems reasonable that the overproduction of surfactant represents a little-known defensive posture of the lungs. Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of surface active phospholipids and specific proteins that stabilize the alveoli and distal airways of the lungs. The phospholipid component consist...|$|R

Materials and methods: This is a longitudinal population-based study comprising 3, 612 randomly selected subjects from Gothenburg, Sweden, aged 25 – 75 years. Lung function was measured at baseline with spirometry and the included subjects answered a questionnaire on respiratory symptoms. At follow-up, the subjects answered a questionnaire with a response rate of 87 %. NIR was defined as symptoms of nasal obstruction, nasal secretion, and/or sneezing attacks without having a cold, during the last 5 years. COPD was defined as a spirometry ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second divided by forced vital capacity (FEV 1 /FVC) 40 years. Smoking, atopy, and occupational exposure to gas, fumes, or dust were also associated with new-onset NIR. COPD, smoking, and atopy remained individual risk factors for new-onset NIR in the logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: This longitudinal population-based study of a large cohort showed that COPD is a risk factor for developing NIR. Smoking and atopy are also risk factors for NIR. The results indicate that there is a link present between upper and lower respiratory inflammation in NIR and COPD. Keywords: COPD, rhinitis, smoking, epidemiology, spirometr...|$|R

There {{is a lack}} of validation and standardization of these items. Materials and methods: In a general population-based study, 1, 050 subjects completed a questionnaire and performed spirometry, including forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) after inhalation of 400 µg of salbutamol. COPD was defined as the ratio of FEV 1 /FVC < 0. 7 after bronchodilation. Physician-diagnosed COPD was defined as an affirmative answer to the single item: “Have you ever had COPD diagnosed by a physician?”, physician-diagnosed COPD/emphysema as an affirmative answer to any of the two single items; “Have you ever had COPD diagnosed by a physician?” or “Have you ever been told by a physician that you have emphysema?”, physician-diagnosed chronic bronchitis as an affirmative answer to; “Have you ever been told by a physician that you have chronic bronchitis?” and physician-diagnosed COPD, emphysema or chronic bronchitis was defined as an affirmative answer to either of the three items above. Results: For the single item about physician-diagnosed COPD, the sensitivity was around 0. 11 and the specificity was almost 0. 99 in relation to COPD. The sensitivity of the combined items about COPD/emphysema in detecting COPD was 0. 11 and the specificity was high, 0. 985. When the items about physician-diagnosed COPD, emphysema or chronic bronchitis were merged as one entity, the sensitivity went up (0. 13) and the specificity went down (0. 95). Conclusion: Items about physician-diagnosed COPD have low sensitivity but a very high specificity, indicating that these items will minimize the proportion of false positives. The low sensitivity will underestimate the total burden of COPD in the general population. Items about physician-diagnosed COPD may be used in studies of risk factors for COPD, but are not recommended in prevalence studies.

40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that combustion-derived smoke, such as that produced during incense burning, is a deleterious air pollutant. It is capable of initiating oxidative stress and mutation; however, the related apoptotic processes remain unclear. In order to elucidate the biological mechanisms of reactive oxygen species (ROS) -induced <b>respiratory</b> <b>toxicology,</b> alveolar epithelial A 549 cells were exposed to incense particulate matter (PM), with and without antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). The cross-linking associations between oxidative capacity, cell cycle events, actin cytoskeletal dynamics and intracellular calcium signals were investigated. An incense PM suspension caused significant oxidative stress in A 549 cells, as shown by inhibition of the cell cycle at G 1 and G 2 /M check-points, and the induction of apoptosis at Sub-G 1. At the same time, alterations in the F-actin filamentous assemblies were observed. The levels of intracellular Ca 2 + were increased after incense PM exposure. Antioxidant NAC treatment revealed that oxidative stress and F-actin remodelling was significantly mitigated. This suggests that ROS accumulation could alter cell cycle regulation and anomalous remodelling of the cortical cytoskeleton that allowed impaired cells to enter into apoptosis. This study has elucidated the integral patho-physiological interactions of incense PM and the potential mechanisms for the development of ROS-driven respiratory impairment...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a variety}} of smoke {{exposure}} systems available to the tobacco industry and <b>respiratory</b> <b>toxicology</b> research groups, each with their own way of diluting/delivering smoke to cell cultures. Thus a simple technique to measure dose in vitro needs to be utilised. Dosimetry—assessment of dose—is a key element in linking the biological effects of smoke generated by various exposure systems. Microbalance technology is presented as a dosimetry tool and a way of measuring whole smoke dose. Described here is a new tool to quantify diluted smoke particulate deposition in vitro. The triplicate quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) chamber measured real-time deposition of smoke at a range of dilutions 1 [*]:[*] 5 – 1 [*]:[*] 400 (smoke[*]:[*]air). Mass was read in triplicate by 3 identical QCMs installed into one in vitro exposure chamber, each in the location in which a cell culture would be exposed to smoke at the air-liquid interface. This resulted in quantification of deposited particulate matter in the range 0. 21 – 28. 00 [*]μg/cm 2. Results demonstrated that the QCM could discriminate mass between dilutions and was able to give information of regional deposition where cell cultures would usually be exposed within the chamber. Our aim is to use the QCM to support the preclinical (in vitro) evaluation of tobacco products...|$|E
