40|$|AbstractLactic acid {{is one of}} the {{functional}} and valuable compounds utilized in food, pharmaceutical and chemical industries while Poly lactic acid (PLA) is a biodegradable polymer that has a variety of applications. In recent years, microbial conversion of <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> has become an important objective in industrial biotechnology. Sugarcane molasses can be considered as potential <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> in PLA production. The objective {{of this study is to}} optimized fermentation medium and conditions to obtain maximum lactic acid production and Colony Forming Unit (log CFU/mL) through response surface methodology (RSM). The maximum lactic acid production (38. 33 %) and log CFU/mL (8. 30) by Lactobacillus casei M- 15 was under 3. 82 % of molasses and 8. 02 % of inoculum level within 24 hr at 37 °C respectively. This process will be advantageous for increasing yields of lactic acid and enhancing productivity by optimization technique. Moreover, it can reduce waste disposal and pollution and can selectively produce by sustainable agriculture such as agriculture material. In addition, the high-performance of lactic acid-producing microorganisms, qualified <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> and effective fermentation processes will be benefit for bioplastic technologies...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of sustainable processes and {{the implementation of}} <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> are increasingly important for the chemical industry. In particular, homogeneous catalysis is a key technology in this context since it allows for atom economic and selective syntheses under mild reaction conditions. In this work, two important tasks in process development for homogeneously catalysed carbonylation reactions were investigated: Recycling of known homogeneous transition metal catalysts Development of new catalytic systems for the conversion of substrates based on <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> in tandem reactions As a recycling strategy for homogeneous transition metal catalysts, the use of thermomorphic multicomponent solvent (TMS) systems was systematically investigated in four steps: 1. 	Development of a new solvent selection strategy for TMS systems 2. 	Application of TMS systems in the conversion of technical grade feedstocks 3. 	Application of TMS systems in the conversion of renewable feedstocks 4. 	Application of TMS systems in reactions with inherently limited degrees of freedom in the solvent choice The results of these investigations led to the {{development of}} a guideline for process development for homogeneously catalyzed reactions in thermomorphic multicomponent solvent systems. Three new catalytic systems were developed for the conversion of substrates based on <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> in tandem hydroformylations. In the hydroaminomethylation and the reductive hydroformylation, two of the novel catalyst systems allow for a direct conversion of the intermediately formed aldehydes. This makes their purification superfluous, which is of great advantage from an economic and ecologic point of view. The newly developed catalyst system for the isomerising hydroformylation of unsaturated fatty acid methyl esters opens a new way for the synthesis of valuable products from <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

40|$|Renewable {{resources}} pose special {{challenges to}} process synthesis. Due to decentral raw material generation, usually low transport densities and the perishable character of most renewable raw materi-als {{in combination with}} their time dependent availability, logistical questions as well as adaptation to regional agricultural structures are necessary. This calls for synthesis of structures not only of single processes but of the whole value chain attached to the utilisation of a certain resource. As most of the innovative technologies proposed to build on a <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> base face stiff economic competition from fossil based processes, economic optimality of the value chain is crucial to their implementation. On top of this widening of the process definition for synthesis, many processes {{on the base of}} renewable resources apply technologies (like membrane separations, chromatographic purifi-cation steps, etc.) for which the heuristic knowledge is still slim. This reduces the choice of methods for process synthesis, mainly to methods based on combinatorial principles. The paper investigates applicability as well as impact on technology development of process synthesis for <b>renewable</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> utilisation. It takes logistic considerations into account and applies process synthesis to the case study of the green biorefinery concept...|$|E

The materials, which are not affected by fire, do not exist in the world although many researchers are studying about fire-retardant agent for indoor material.|$|E
