40|$|Corporates are {{entering}} {{the brave new world}} of the internet and digitization without much regard for the fine print of a growing regulation regime. More traditional outsourcing arrangements are already falling foul of the regulators as rules and supervision intensifies. Furthermore, ‘shadow IT’ is proliferating as the attractions of SaaS, mobile, cloud services, social media, and endless new ‘apps’ drive usage outside corporate IT. Initial cost-benefit analyses of the Cloud make such arrangements look immediately attractive but losing control of architecture, security, applications and deployment can have far reaching and damaging regulatory consequences. From research in financial services, this paper details the increasing body of regulations, their inherent risks for businesses and how the dangers can be pre-empted and managed. We then delineate a model for managing these risks specifically focused on investigating, strategizing and governing outsourcing arrangements and related <b>regulatory</b> <b>obligation...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present an Indefeasible Right of Use (IRU) as a {{possible}} remedy for telecom infrastructure EU projects that (in Poland) have been lagged behind the time. Thanks for IRU, Beneficiaries of these EU projects will be able to save both: time and money and will finish projects successfully. The author discusses two possible methods of implementing IRU: via <b>regulatory</b> <b>obligation</b> and via incumbent’s goodwill. The author proposes a game theory model with payoffs depending on regulator’s and incumbent’s strategies. Using a game theory tree, the author shows that if only the incumbent is willing to offer his own network, IRU may be signed and most delays in EU projects disappear. The success is not so obvious while implementing IRU as an obligation – in this case EU projects will probably fail. ...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Once {{compensatory}} wetland mitigation projects {{meet their}} permit criteria {{they are expected}} to last in perpetuity and are presumed to be self-sustaining. However, once projects are beyond their period of <b>regulatory</b> <b>obligation</b> there is rarely any follow up to determine how the projects ultimately end up. Recently, federal mitigation guidance has introduced a long-term management requirement, recognizing that to presume projects will continue to be successful without any long-term care may be flawed. Between 1999 and 2002 the WA State Department of Ecology conducted a Wetland Mitigation Evaluation Study {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} compensatory wetland mitigation across the state. Projects evaluated were all less than ten years old and were still within their period of <b>regulatory</b> <b>obligation.</b> This thesis research revisited a subset of the mitigation projects used in Ecology's study to explore what has happened to them ecologically and institutionally in the ten years since the study, and to identify what can be learned from those projects to inform long-term management practices. Office and field investigations were performed for nine mitigation projects. Current ecological function of the sites was assessed and a functional comparison of the sites from 2002 to now was completed as well as a review of the institutional conditions surrounding the sites and their management. Relevance of the current site conditions to the overall intention of the mitigation are discussed and recommendations given for considerations to include in the development of long-term management guidance. This research shows that mitigation areas evolve over time due to both internal processes and external influences and that once permit criteria are met, the ecological trajectory of sites does not necessarily match that of the mitigation design. Institutional consistency was found to be lacking among the mitigation sites investigated and transfer of long-term stewardship responsibility to a third party group is recommended to help improve long-term outcomes...|$|R
