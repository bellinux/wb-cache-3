40|$|This paper aims {{to clarify}} {{the effects of the}} flipped {{learning}} model on first-year university students in Japan. Recent research has found that the English proficiency level of Japanese high school students is declining. Many universities have tried to address this issue through e-learning.

40|$|A {{molecular}} level {{understanding of the}} photoreactivity of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) becomes increasingly important as the spatial resolution starts to be limited {{by the size of}} the resist and the spatial extent of the photochemical reactions in photoresist micropatterning.

Our results suggest that the top of the ODS SAMs is the preferential reactive site. Using a novel, highly surface sensitive technique, fluorescence labeling of surface species, we identified the presence of submonolayer quantities chemical functional groups formed by the UV degradation.

This essay studies what role immigrant employees within the local bank sector have for the probability of immigrants to run their own businesses. I use linked employer-employee data covering the whole Swedish labor market for the years 1987 to 2003 and utilize a nationwide refugee dispersal policy to get exogenous variation in the exposure to co-ethnic bank employees. Results suggest that there is a positive relation between co-ethnic bank employees and the probability of being self-employed.

40|$|Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is an {{emerging}} paradigm that has radically {{changed the way}} software applications are architected, designed and implemented. SOA allows developers to structure their systems {{as a set of}} ready-made, reusable and compostable services. The leading technology used today for implementing SOA is Web Services. Indeed, like all software, Web services are prone to change constantly to add new user requirements or to adapt to environment changes. Poorly planned changes may risk introducing antipatterns into the system. Consequently, this may ultimately leads to a degradation of software quality, evident by poor quality of service (QoS). In this paper, we introduce an automated approach to detect Web service antipatterns using genetic programming. Our approach consists of using knowledge from real-world examples of Web service antipatterns to generate detection rules based on combinations of metrics and threshold values. We evaluate our approach on a benchmark of 310 Web services and a variety of five types of Web service antipatterns. The statistical analysis of the obtained <b>results</b> <b>provides</b> <b>evidence</b> that our approach is efficient to detect most of the existing antipatterns with a score of 85 % of precision and 87 % of recall.

40|$|Heritable {{epigenetic}} modulation of {{gene expression}} {{is a candidate}} mechanism to explain parental environmental effects on offspring phenotypes, but current evidence for environment-induced epigenetic changes that persist in offspring generations is scarce. In apomictic dandelions, exposure to various stresses was previously shown to heritably alter DNA methylation patterns. In this study we explore whether these induced changes are accompanied by heritable effects on offspring phenotypes. We observed effects of parental jasmonic acid treatment on offspring specific leaf area and on offspring interaction with a generalist herbivore; and of parental nutrient stress on offspring root-shoot biomass ratio, tissue P-content and leaf morphology. Some of the effects appeared to enhance offspring {{ability to cope with}} the same stresses that their parents experienced. Effects differed between apomictic genotypes and were not always consistently observed between different experiments, {{especially in the case of}} parental nutrient stress. While this context-dependency of the effects remains to be further clarified, the total set of <b>results</b> <b>provides</b> <b>evidence</b> for the existence of transgenerational effects in apomictic dandelions. Zebularine treatment affected the within-generation response to nutrient stress, pointing at a role of DNA methylation in phenotypic plasticity to nutrient environments. This study shows that stress exposure in apomictic dandelions can cause transgenerational phenotypic effects, in addition to previously demonstrated transgenerational DNA methylation effects. ...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension {{in patients with}} systemic sclerosis is a disease involving multiple organ systems. We investigated the differences in perceptions of how to measure PAH-SSc among cardiologists, pulmonologists and rheumatologists. We also examined how a Delphi exercise can improve agreement among these subspecialties. METHODS: The outcome measures derived from the recent Delphi survey were used for {{a detailed analysis of}} the contribution of the various specialties contributing to it. We compared rheumatologists and cardiologist/pulmonologists with regards to preferences and ratings of various endpoints and the actual use of tools to measure these outcomes. We also examined the effects of the Delphi process among these groups. RESULTS: We could show that the different expert groups each tended to contribute differently {{to the development of the}} core set of measures and that interactions in the Delphi process resulted in convergence of rankings. Despite agreement on the high importance of the domains in the Delphi, the use of tools within those domains was sometimes divergent and dependent on specialty. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, use of differing tools in the diagnosis and treatment of PAH-SSc can be anticipated. Further, the convergence of <b>results</b> <b>provides</b> <b>evidence,</b> for the first time, for the ability of various approaches in these disciplines to reach harmonious endpoints of care for PAHSSc patients.

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} impact of home country’s economic status on immigrant self-employment probability in the U. S. We estimate a probability model and find that, consistent across race, immigrants from developed countries {{are more likely to}} be self-employed in the U. S than are immigrants from developing countries. This result is unexpected given previous re-search which suggests that immigrants from countries with high levels of self-employment tend to be more involved in self-employment in the U. S. Developing countries, on average, have higher self-employment rates than do developed countries but our research shows that immigrants from developing countries have similar or lower self-employment probabilities relative to that of na-tive born White-Americans. In contrast, immigrants from developed countries have significantly higher self-employment probabilities relative to that of native born White-Americans. We pro-vide evidence that this result cannot be explained by differences in wealth or savings of imigrant. Instead, we hypothesize that institutional arrangements in the developed world may be similar across countries allowing immigrants from developed countries to have an informational or rele-vant skill advantage over immigrants from developing countries.

40|$|The usually short-sized {{samples of}} data {{recorded}} {{at a site}} and the large uncertainties involved in parameter and quantile estimation {{are some of the}} shortcomings encountered in at-site frequency analysis of hydrologic annual maxima. Another drawback is the subjectivity entailed by the arbitrary selection of a candidate probability distribution to model the sample of hydrological annual maxima. Conventional goodness-of-fit tests are not designed to discriminate among candidate models and are not powerful enough to provide the necessary objective backing to such a decision-making process and may possibly lead a novice hydrologist to inadequate choices. In this paper, we describe t he authors experience in employing the technology of artificial intelligence and fuzzy-logic theory to Guild a computer expert system that emulates the reasoning principles used by a human expert to select one or more candidate probability distribution models for at-site hydrologic frequency analysis. The expert system has been applied to 20 relatively large samples of annual maxima of daily rainfall and daily streamflow recorded at gauging stations in the Brazilian southeast.

40|$|A major {{limitation}} to {{a prolonged}} use of adriamycin (ADM) during a clinical treatment is its dose-dependent cardiotoxicity. This toxicity has {{been related to}} a general disturbance of the inner mitochondrial membrane structure and its essential biological functions, associated {{to the production of}} free radicals by the anthracyclines. 4 '-Epiadriamycin (4 '-epiADM), 4 '-deoxyadriamycin (4 '-deoxyADM), 4 '-deoxy- 4 '-iodoadriamycin (4 '-deoxy- 4 '-iodoADM) and 4 '-demethoxydaunorubicin (4 -demethoxyDNR) are ADM and daunorubicin (DNR) derivatives differing from their parent compounds by minor structural modifications. They are nevertheless documented as less cardiotoxic. Our purpose was to establish whether mitochondrial membrane damages induced in vivo in mice heart by those compounds are correlated with the free radical formation. Heart mitochondria of treated mice were isolated 48 h after a single drug injection in order to measure the acute mitochondrial toxicity. Enzymatic activities of complex I-III and complex IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, mitochondrial membrane fluidity and lipid peroxidation were measured. None of the ADM and DNR derivatives displayed a significant acute mitochondrial toxicity. A mitochondrial toxicity was however detected for 4 -deoxyADM and 4 -demethoxyDNR when drugs were given chronically, but it was strongly reduced as compared with ADM and DNR. Electron transfer between NADH and cytochrome c, formation of superoxide radicals and lipid peroxidation were measured in vitro for the various drugs.

40|$|Due to the {{importance}} of clay minerals in metal sorption, many studies have attempted to derive mechanistic models that describe adsorption processes. These models often include several different types of adsorption sites, including permanent charge sites and silanol and aluminol functional groups on the edges of clay minerals. To provide a basis for development of adsorption models it is critical that molecular-level studies be done to characterize sorption processes. In this study we conducted X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopic experiments on copper (II) sorbed on smectite clays using suspension pH and ionic strength as variables. At low ionic strength, results suggest that Cu is sorbing in the interlayers and maintains its hydration sphere. At high ionic strength, Cu atoms are excluded from the interlayer and sorb primarily on the silanol and aluminol functional groups of the montmorillonite or beidellite structures. Interpretation of the XAFS and EPR spectroscopy <b>results</b> <b>provides</b> <b>evidence</b> that multinuclear complexes are forming. Fitting of extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra revealed that the Cu-Cu atoms in the multinuclear complexes are 2. 65 Å apart, and have coordination numbers near one. This structural information suggests that small Cu dimers are sorbing on the surface. These complexes are consistent with observed sorption on mica and amorphous silicon dioxide, yet are inconsistent with previous spectroscopic results for Cu sorption on montmorillonite. The results reported in this paper provide mechanistic data that will be valuable for modeling surface interactions of Cu with clay minerals, and predicting the geochemical cycling of Cu in the environment...|$|E
40|$|Sensitivity to the attentional {{effects of}} SKF 81297, a {{selective}} full agonist at dopamine D 1 receptors, was assessed in adult rats exposed to cocaine prenatally (via intravenous injections) and controls. The task assessed {{the ability of}} the subjects to monitor an unpredictable light cue of either 300 or 700 msec duration and to maintain performance when presented with olfactory distractors. SKF 81297 decreased nose pokes before cue presentation and increased latencies and response biases (the tendency to respond to the same port used on the previous trial), suggesting an effect of SKF 81297 on the dopamine (DA) systems responsible for response initiation and selection. The cocaine-exposed (COC) and control animals did not differ in sensitivity to the effects of SKF 81297 on these measures. In contrast, the COC animals were significantly more sensitive than were controls to the impairing effect of SKF 81297 on omission errors, a measure of sustained attention. This pattern of <b>results</b> <b>provides</b> <b>evidence</b> that prenatal cocaine exposure produces lasting changes in the DA system(s) subserving sustained attention but does not alter the DA system(s) underlying response selection and initiation.

40|$|Predictive timing in {{cognition}} {{and action}} {{is a prerequisite for}} the effective interaction between an individual and the environment. Predictive timing implies some internal representation of temporal structure, probably generated by cerebellar and basal ganglia temporal processing systems (for a review see Buhusi and Meck, 2005). In turn, this representation of temporal structure could be instrumental in synchronizing cognitive processes and the allocation of cognitive recourses with external events. For example, Dynamic Attending Theory (DAT, Large and Jones, 1999) proposes that attention can be modeled as a self-sustained oscillation capable of entrainment, i. e., unidirectional coupling or “locking-into” the temporal structure of sensory input. In the current study, we used the high temporal resolution of the Electroencephalogram (EEG) to explore the impact of temporal grouping and temporal regularity in sensory input on the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) and P 3 b event-related-potentials (ERPs). The MMN is associated with the pre-attentive processing of a deviant event embedded in a sequence of standard events, whereas the P 3 b reflects attentive processing of such event (for reviews see Linden, 2005; Polich, 2007; Näätänen et al., 2007). The P 3 b, but not the MMN component was sensitive to temporal regularity, while both ERPs differed as a function of deviant position within a stimulus group.
