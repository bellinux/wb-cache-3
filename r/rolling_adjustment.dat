5000|$|A rolling {{recession}}, or a <b>rolling</b> <b>adjustment</b> recession {{occurs when}} the recession only affects certain {{sectors of the economy}} at a time. As one sector enters recovery, the slowdown will ‘roll’ into another part of the economy. On a whole, rolling recessions occurs regardless of nationwide or statewide economic recession and the effects may not be in the national economic measures e.g. GDP (Gross Domestic Product). The Recession of 1960-61 in the United States {{is an example of a}} rolling-adjustment recession.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} focused on the {{influence}} of neck vibration on the perception of the head and trunk midline position (orientation and localization). The orientation of the head and trunk was investigated by the <b>rolling</b> <b>adjustment</b> of a rod on their midline while their localization was investigated by the adjustment of the position of a visual dot as being straight-ahead the eyes or the sternum. The first experiment investigated whether a head-trunk dissociation was induced by the unilateral vibration of neck muscles in upright and restrained subjects. Results showed that the subjective orientation and localization of whole-body midline were shifted toward the vibrated side. The second experiment determined the effect of the neck muscles vibration when the subjects were lying on their side. The effect of vibration disappeared when the side of vibration was opposed to the side of postural inclination and it was stronger than in the upright position when the side of vibration and the side of postural inclination were congruent. Whereas, results suggested that the input from neck muscle proprioceptors participates directly to the elaboration of the egocentric space, the question may be raised as to how the sensory cues interacted in their contribution to the neural generation of an egocentric, body centred coordinate system...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} focused on the {{influence}} of gravity-based information on the orientation and localization of the perceived body midline. The orientation was investigated by the <b>rolling</b> <b>adjustment</b> of a rod on the subjects' Z-axis and the localization by the horizontal adjustment of a visual dot as being straight ahead. Experiment 1 investigated the effect of the dissociation between the Z-axis and the direction of gravity by placing subjects in roll tilt and supine postures. In roll tilt, the perception of the body midline orientation was deviated in the direction of body tilt and the perception of its localization was deviated in the opposite direction. In the supine body orientation, estimates of the Z-axis and straight-ahead remained veridical as when the body was upright. Experiment 2 highlighted the relative importance of the otolithic and tactile information using diffuse pressure stimulation. The estimation of body midline orientation was modified contrarily to the estimation of its localization. Thus, subjects had no absolute representation of their egocentric space. The main hypothesis regarding the dissociation between the orientation and localization of the body midline may be related to a difference in the integration of sensory information. It can be suggested that the horizontal component of the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) contributed to the perceived localization of the body midline, whereas its orientation was mainly influenced by tactile information...|$|E

25|$|Although Alexandra {{had been}} {{designed}} primarily as a summer-time day excursion steamer, the company had intended to use the ship, which had a 300-ton cargo capacity, as a freighter in the off-season to transport canning supplies to, and pick up packed salmon from, the many canneries {{along the coast of}} British Columbia north of Vancouver Island. This was done just once, following the close of the 1924 summer season. Alexandra was sent north to the Skeena River with a load of cans. On the way south, laden with salmon, in open waters of Queen Charlotte Sound, the ship rolled continuously and dangerously as much as 35 degrees. While it would probably have been possible to mitigate the <b>rolling</b> by <b>adjustments</b> to the ship's trim, the company had other vessels which could serve the route, and thereafter the Alexandra was kept on the southern routes.|$|R
40|$|Subject of investigation: high-purity foil from aluminium, grade A 99, for anodes of {{electrolytic}} capacitors with the required consumer properties. The work describes original methods {{of controlling the}} non-flatness of foil by means of scanning of light signals and their processing and calculation of the flaw amplitude magnitude in a static position and directly {{in the course of}} rolling on a foil rolling mill. The investigation concerns the mechanism of appearance and transformation of flaws of the shape in the course of foil rolling and classification of these flaws. Mathematical models are constructed for the connection of the technological parameters of the <b>rolling</b> mill <b>adjustment</b> and their dynamic control facilities with the characteristics of flatness of foil and its operational properties. The work determines the necessary and sufficient conditions for the aluminium foil rolling process with the minimum non-flatness, which permit production of foil possessing properties required for manufacture of anodes of {{electrolytic capacitors}}. The investigation has brought about improvement of the foil rolling process from aluminium of the A 99 grade 100, 80 and 50 mu m thick.

3000|$|One {{question}} raised is {{what the}} duration-of-load adjustment factor is for the CLT rolling shear strength under a 30 -year dead load only case. To answer this question, the <b>rolling</b> shear strength <b>adjustment</b> factor [...] K_D with consideration of the duration-of-load effect for this constant dead loading case was evaluated. The performed procedure for this evaluation {{was similar to that}} introduced in the previous sections, except the dead load only case was characterized not only by changing the load factor 1.25 in Eq. (2) to be 1.40 (considering the different load combination factor from the design code for the dead load only loading case) [18], but also by letting [...] r [...] tend to infinity (here chosen to be 1000 consistent with the duration-of-load research on dimensional lumber) leading to the randomness from snow load can be ignored in the following reliability calculation [11].|$|R
30|$|In this study, the duration-of-load {{effect on}} the rolling shear {{strength}} of cross laminated timber (CLT), with different cross-sectional layups (five-layer and three-layer), was evaluated. A stress-based damage accumulation model is chosen to evaluate the duration-of-load strength adjustment factor of the rolling shear strength of CLT. This model incorporates the established short-term rolling shear strength of material and predicts the time to failure under arbitrary loading history. The model has been calibrated and verified based on the test data from low cycle trapezoidal fatigue tests (damage accumulation tests) in the previous study. The long-term rolling shear behaviour of CLT can then be evaluated from this verified model. As the developed damage accumulation model is a probabilistic model, it {{can be incorporated into}} a time based reliability assessment of the CLT products, considering short-term, snow, and dead load only loading cases. The reliability analysis results and factors reflecting the duration-of-load {{effect on the}} rolling shear strength of CLT are compared and discussed. The characteristic of this modeling theory lies in that the verified model is also able to predict the duration-of-load behaviour of CLT products under arbitrary loading history, such as long-term dead load case; then, these predictions of time to failure from the damage accumulation model can elucidate duration of load by the stress ratio evaluation approach. The results suggest that the duration-of-load <b>rolling</b> shear strength <b>adjustment</b> factor for CLT is more severe than the general duration-of-load adjustment factor for lumber; this difference should be considered in the introduction of CLT into the building codes for engineered wood design.|$|R
