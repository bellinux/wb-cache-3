25|$|While Dutch {{portrait}} painting {{avoids the}} swagger and excessive {{rhetoric of the}} aristocratic Baroque portraiture current {{in the rest of}} 17th-century Europe, the sombre clothing of male and in many cases female sitters, and the Calvinist feeling that the inclusion of props, possessions or views of land in the background would show the sin of pride leads to an undeniable sameness in many Dutch portraits, for all their technical quality. Even a standing pose is usually avoided, as a full-length might also show pride. Poses are undemonstrative, especially for women, though children may be allowed more freedom. The classic moment for having a portrait painted was upon marriage, when the new husband and wife more often than not occupied separate frames in a pair of paintings. Rembrandt's later portraits compel by force of characterization, and sometimes a narrative element, but even his early portraits can be dispiriting en masse, as in the <b>roomful</b> <b>of</b> 'starter Rembrandts' donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.|$|E

500|$|On May 21, 1946, {{physicist}} Louis Slotin {{and seven}} other Los Alamos personnel {{were in a}} Los Alamos laboratory conducting another experiment to verify the exact point at which a subcritical mass (core) of fissile material could be made critical by the positioning of neutron reflectors. Slotin, who was leaving Los Alamos, was showing the technique to Alvin C. Graves, who would {{use it in a}} final test before the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests scheduled a month later at Bikini Atoll. It required the operator to place two half-spheres of beryllium (a neutron reflector) around the core to be tested and manually lower the top reflector over the core via a thumb hole on the top. As the reflectors were manually moved closer and farther away from each other, scintillation counters measured the relative activity from the core. Allowing them to close completely could result in the instantaneous formation of a critical mass and a lethal power excursion. Under Slotin's unapproved protocol, the only thing preventing this was the blade of a standard straight screwdriver, manipulated by the scientist's other hand. Slotin, who was given to bravado, became the local expert, performing the test on almost a dozen occasions, often in his trademark blue jeans and cowboy boots, in front of a <b>roomful</b> <b>of</b> observers. Enrico Fermi reportedly told Slotin and others they would be [...] "dead within a year" [...] if they continued performing it. [...] Scientists referred to this flirting with the possibility of a nuclear chain reaction as [...] "tickling the dragon's tail", based on a remark by physicist Richard Feynman, who compared the experiments to [...] "tickling the tail of a sleeping dragon".|$|E

We are easily tempted to buy bigger machines or <b>roomfuls</b> <b>of</b> little ones to address the scalability problem. Yet, careful analysis and evaluation of the shape and characteristics of our data—using metrics—often leads to dramatic improvements in performance. Indeed, {{it is important to}} consider the size and distribution of data within a hierarchy, but the size and depth of ontologies themselves (some as large as 500, 000 classes) needs to play a more prominent role in benchmarking and evaluation. Therefore, we have synthesized a set of representative ontologies which yield additional insight into load-time costs during benchmarking analysis. By further analyzing instance density and ontology evolution metrics, we have reduced the population time (including materialization of the transitive closure) for the NCBO Resource Index—a database of 16. 4 billion annotations linking 2. 4 million ontology terms to 3. 5 million data elements—from one week to less than one hour on the same machine. ...|$|R
50|$|Using the {{technology}} of computing as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time Dwight Eisenhower was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like Harvard University and his own, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce <b>roomfuls</b> <b>of</b> machinery into a package that could be sold as a mainframe (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like International Business Machines (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around {{the beginning of the}} 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the National Security Agency (NSA). It was {{about two and a half}} decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit, to the very people who had already paid for them.|$|R

For {{the second half}} of the concert, he added Jimmie as rhythm guitarist, drummer George Rains, keyboardist Dr. John, <b>Roomful</b> <b>of</b> Blues horn section, and featured vocalist Angela Strehli. The ensemble rehearsed for less than two weeks before the performance, and despite the solid dynamics of Double Trouble for the first half of the performance, according to Patoski and Crawford, the big band concept never entirely took form. Before arriving at the engagement, the venue sold out, which made Vaughan extremely excited and nervous as he did not calm down until halfway through the third song. A benefit for the T.J. Martell Foundation's work in leukemia and cancer research, he was an important draw for the event. As his scheduled time slot drew closer, he indicated that he preferred traveling to the venue by limousine to avoid being swarmed by fans on the street; the band took the stage around 8:00p.m. The audience of 2,200 people, which included Vaughan's wife, family and friends, transformed the venue into what Stephen Holden of The New York Times described as [...] "a whistling, stomping roadhouse".|$|E
5000|$|The palace was {{commissioned}} by Prince Andrey Kyrillovich Razumovsky as a [...] Neoclassic embassy worthy of the representative of Alexander I. It was built at the prince's own expense and to the designs of Louis Montoyer, in Landstraße, close to the city center of Vienna. He filled it with antiquities and modern works of art. On New Year's Eve 1814, the prince held a glittering ball with Tsar Alexander I as guest of honour. Probably {{the only person in}} Vienna who was invited but did not go, was Ludwig van Beethoven. To accommodate the guests, Razumovsky erected a temporary ballroom extension, heated by a flue from the palace. After all the guests had gone, the flue caught fire, setting the ballroom ablaze and burning out <b>roomfuls</b> <b>of</b> art in the palace. Rasumovsky, though he was raised to Prince the following year, was never the same. He lived in seclusion in Vienna until his death in 1836.

6000|$|The {{little place}} is so rural and tranquil, and yet discreetly animated, that its being within the town is, for {{convenience}} and immediate accessibility, purely to the good; {{and the house}} itself, though modest and unelaborate, full of a charming little stamp and dignity of its period (about 1705) without as well as within. The next time I go down to see to its [...] "doing up," [...] I will {{try to have a}} photograph taken of the pleasant little old-world town-angle into which its nice old red-bricked front, its high old Georgian doorway and a most delightful little old architectural garden-house, perched alongside of it on its high brick garden-wall--into which all these pleasant features together so happily [...] "compose." [...] Two years ago, after I had lost my heart to it--walking over from Point Hill to make sheep's eyes at it (the more so that it is called Lamb House!)--there was no appearance whatever that one could ever have it; either that its fond proprietor would give it up or that if he did it would come at all within one's means. So I simply sighed and renounced; tried to think no more about it; till at last, out of the blue, a note from the good local ironmonger, to whom I had whispered at the time my hopeless passion, informed me that by the sudden death of the owner and the preference (literal) of his son for Klondyke, it might perhaps drop into my lap. Well, {{to make a long story}} short, it did immediately drop and, more miraculous still to say, on terms, for a long lease, well within one's means--terms quite deliciously moderate. The result of these is, naturally, that they will [...] "do" [...] nothing to it: but, on the other hand, it has been so well lived in and taken care of that the doing--off one's own bat--is reduced mainly to sanitation and furnishing--which latter includes the peeling off of old papers from several <b>roomfuls</b> <b>of</b> pleasant old top-to-toe wood panelling. There are two rooms of complete old oak--one of them a delightful little parlour, opening by one side into the little vista, church-ward, of the small old-world street, where not one of the half-dozen wheeled vehicles of Rye ever passes; and on the other straight into the garden and the approach, from that quarter, to the garden-house aforesaid, which is simply the making of a most commodious and picturesque detached study and workroom. Ten days ago Alfred Parsons, best of men as well as best of landscape-painters-and-gardeners, went down with me and revealed to me the most charming possibilities for the treatment of the tiny out-of-door part--it amounts to about an acre of garden and lawn, all shut in by the peaceful old red wall aforesaid, on which the most flourishing old espaliers, apricots, pears, plums and figs, assiduously grow. It appears that it's a glorious little growing exposure, air, and soil--and all the things that were still flourishing out of doors (November 20th) were a joy to behold. There went with me also a good friend of mine, Edward Warren, a very distingué architect and loyal spirit, who is taking charge of whatever is to be done. So I hope to get in, comfortably enough, early in May. In the meantime one must [...] "pick up" [...] a sufficient quantity of ancient mahogany-and-brass odds and ends--a task really the more amusing, here, where the resources are great, for having to be thriftily and cannily performed. The house is really quite charming enough in its particular character, and as to the stamp of its period, not to do violence to by rash modernities; and I am developing, under its influence and its inspiration, the most avid and gluttonous eye and most infernal watching patience, in respect of lurking [...] "occasions" [...] in not too-delusive Chippendale and Sheraton. The [...] "King's Room" [...] will be especially treated with a preoccupation of the comfort and aesthetic sense of cherished sisters-in-law; King's Room so-called by reason of George Second having passed a couple of nights there and so stamped it for ever. (He was forced ashore, at Rye, on a progress somewhere with some of his ships, by a tempest, and accommodated at Lamb House as at the place in the town then most consonant with his grandeur. It would, for that matter, quite correspond to this description still. Likewise the Mayors of Rye have usually lived there! Or the persons usually living there have usually become mayors! That was conspicuously the case with the late handsome old Mr. Bellingham, whose son is my landlord. So you see the ineluctable dignity in store for me.) But enough of this swagger. I have been copious to copiously amuse you.|$|R
2500|$|Decades later, Adams' {{highly publicized}} {{life and death}} at a young age, his friendships with {{cultural}} icons such as James Dean and Elvis Presley, and his reported drug consumption made his private life the subject of many reports and assertions by some writers who have claimed Adams may have been gay or bisexual.
