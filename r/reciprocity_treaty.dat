5|$|His {{time in the}} Senate allowed Blaine {{to develop}} his foreign policy ideas. He {{advocated}} expansion of the American navy and merchant marine, which had been in decline since the Civil War. Blaine also bitterly opposed {{the results of the}} arbitration with Great Britain over American fishermen’s right to fish in Canadian waters, which resulted in a $5.5 million award to Britain. Blaine’s Anglophobia combined with his support of high tariffs. He had initially opposed a <b>reciprocity</b> <b>treaty</b> with Canada that would have reduced tariffs between the two nations, {{but by the end of}} his time in the Senate, he had changed his mind, believing that Americans had more to gain by increasing exports than they would lose by the risk of cheap imports.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{with the}} United Kingdom were tense, as American {{fishermen}} felt menaced by the British navy's increasing enforcement of Canadian waters. Marcy completed a trade reciprocity agreement with British minister to Washington, John Crampton, which {{would reduce the}} need for aggressive coastline enforcement. Buchanan was sent as minister to London to pressure the British government, which was slow to support a new treaty. A favorable <b>reciprocity</b> <b>treaty</b> was ratified in August 1854, which Pierce saw as a first step towards the American annexation of Canada. While the administration negotiated with Britain over the Canada–US border, U.S. interests were also threatened in Central America, where the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty of 1850 had failed to keep Great Britain from expanding its influence. Gaining the advantage over Britain in the region was a key part of Pierce's expansionist goals.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald and his {{government}} faced immediate problems upon formation of the new country. Much work remained to do in creating a federal government. Nova Scotia was already threatening {{to withdraw from the}} union; the Intercolonial Railway, which would both conciliate the Maritimes and bind them closer to the rest of Canada, was not yet built. Anglo-American relations were in a poor state, and Canadian foreign relations were matters handled from London. The withdrawal of the Americans in 1866 from the <b>Reciprocity</b> <b>Treaty</b> had increased tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets. Much of present-day Canada remained outside confederation—in addition to the separate colonies of Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and British Columbia, which remained governed by the British, vast areas in the north and west belonged to the British and to the Hudson's Bay Company. American and British opinion was that the experiment of Confederation would quickly unravel, and the nascent nation absorbed by the United States.|$|E

5|$|American negotiators soon {{concluded}} a <b>reciprocity</b> <b>treaty</b> with France, {{and the two}} nations approached Britain to gauge British enthusiasm for bimetallism. The Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, and his government showed some interest in the idea and told the American envoy, Edward O. Wolcott, {{that he would be}} amenable to reopening the mints in India to silver coinage if the Viceroy's Executive Council there agreed. News of a possible departure from the gold standard stirred up immediate opposition from its partisans, and misgivings by the Indian administration led Britain to reject the proposal. With the international effort a failure, McKinley turned away from silver coinage and embraced the gold standard. Even without the agreement, agitation for free silver eased as prosperity began to return to the United States and gold from recent strikes in the Yukon and Australia increased the monetary supply even without silver coinage. In the absence of international agreement, McKinley favored legislation to formally affirm the gold standard, but was initially deterred by the silver strength in the Senate. By 1900, with another campaign ahead and good economic conditions, McKinley urged Congress to pass such a law, and was able to sign the Gold Standard Act on March 14, 1900, using a gold pen to do so.|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1881, Blaine and Garfield {{were walking}} through the Sixth Street Station of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad in Washington when Garfield was shot by an assassin, Charles J. Guiteau. Guiteau, a {{deranged}} man who had earlier pestered Blaine and other State Department officials to be appointed to ambassadorships {{for which he was}} grossly unqualified, believed that by assassinating the President he could ingratiate himself with Vice President Arthur and receive his coveted position. Guiteau was captured immediately and hanged just short of a year later; he survived longer than Garfield, who lingered for two-and-a-half months, then died on September 19, 1881. Garfield’s death was not just a personal tragedy for Blaine; it also meant the end of his dominance of the cabinet and the end of his foreign policy initiatives. With Arthur’s ascent to the presidency, the Stalwart faction now held sway and Blaine’s days at the State Department were numbered. Arthur asked all of the cabinet members to postpone their resignations until Congress recessed that December; Blaine nonetheless tendered his resignation on October 19, 1881 but agreed to remain in office until December 19, when his successor was in place. Blaine’s replacement was Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Stalwart. Arthur and Frelinghuysen undid much of Blaine’s work, cancelling the call for a Pan-American conference and stopping the effort to end the War of the Pacific, but they did continue the drive for tariff reductions, signing a <b>reciprocity</b> <b>treaty</b> with Mexico in 1882.|$|E

50|$|Because of timber's great importance, in 1820 a {{committee}} of the House of Lords was formed to review {{the state of the}} timber trade. Led by Lord Lansdowne the committee strongly supported the reduction of the duties. This has been viewed {{as one of the first}} successes of free trade ideology in Britain. The duties were not eliminated, but they were brought to a level that left Baltic wood competitive with that from Canada. These reductions were a rare example of laissez-faire in an era still almost totally committed to mercantilism. The post-war era also saw a great unwillingness to enforce the duties that were in place. Rampant smuggling of timber into and out of Norway was mostly ignored, as were the illegal exports of bullion to fund the trade. In 1824 the duties were further lowered when Britain began to sign <b>reciprocity</b> <b>treaties</b> with other powers. Out of the first ten bilateral trade treaties signed, seven of them were with Baltic nations covering all the major timber exporters except for Russia. These quick reversals of Baltic trade policy in an era before free trade was paramount can almost certainly be attributed to the navy's unwillingness to become reliant on Canadian timber now that trade with the Baltic had been unquestionably secured.|$|R

Many Hawaiian businesses and citizens were feeling the pressures of the loss of revenue, so Liliuokalani proposed a lottery and opium licensing to bring in additional revenue for the government. Her ministers and closest friends tried to dissuade her from pursuing the bills, and these controversial proposals were used against her in the looming constitutional crisis.|$|E

At the same time, it granted equal or greater concessions on most items imported from the United States. Cuban imports of American goods went from $17 million {{in the five years}} before the war, to $38 million in 1905, and eventually to over $200 million in 1918.

25|$|Canada's {{chambers}} of commerce feared an imminent disaster. The Anti-Corn Law League was triumphant, but the commercial class and ruling class of Canada, principally English-speaking and conservative, experienced an important setback.

The Canadian government put pressure on Colonial Secretary Earl Grey to have Great Britain negotiate a lowering of the duties imposed on Canadian products entering the United States market, which had become the only lucrative path to export. A <b>reciprocity</b> <b>treaty</b> was ultimately negotiated, but only eight years later in 1854. During the interval, Canada experienced an important political crisis and influential members of society openly discussed three alternatives to the political status quo: annexation to the United States, the federation of the colonies and territories of British North America, and the independence of Canada.

When Mackenzie proved unable to achieve reciprocity, Tupper began shifting toward protectionism and became a proponent of the National Policy which became a part of the Conservative platform in 1876. The sincerity of Tupper's conversion to the protectionist cause was doubted at the time, however: according to one apocryphal story, when Tupper came to the 1876 debate on Finance Minister Richard John Cartwright's budget, he was prepared to advocate free trade if Cartwright had announced that the Liberals had shifted their position and were now supporting protectionism.|$|E

The figures show that we are furnishing profitable employment to the millions of working men throughout the United States. Our capacity to produce has developed so enormously, and our products have so multiplied, that the problem of more markets requires our urgent and immediate attention. By sensible trade arrangements, which will not interrupt our home production, we shall extend the outlets for our ever increasing surplus. What we produce beyond our domestic consumption must have vent abroad. The expansion of our trade and commerce is the pressing problem. Next in advantage to having the thing to sell is to have the conveyance to carry it to the buyer. We must encourage our merchant marine. We must have more ships. They must be under the American flag: built, manned, and owned by Americans. These will not only be profitable in a commercial sense, they will also be messengers of peace wherever they go. <b>Reciprocity</b> <b>treaties</b> are in harmony with the spirit of the times. We must build the isthmian canal which will unite the two oceans and give a straight line of communications with the western coasts of Central and South America, and Mexico. The construction of a pacific cable cannot be longer postponed. In the furtherance of these objects of national interest and concern, you are performing and important part. The good work will go on - it cannot be stopped. These buildings will disappear. This creation of art and beauty and industry will perish from sight. But who can tell the new thoughts that have been awakened, the ambition fired, and the high achievement that will be wrought through this exposition.

40|$|This volume {{starts with}} a paradox. Over {{the last fifteen years}} or so, the number of {{bilateral}} readmission treaties concluded by the EU Member States with third countries has skyrocketed. This is quite extraordinary given the unbalanced <b>reciprocities</b> characterizing such <b>treaties.</b> Despite their being framed in a reciprocal context, readmission treaties incur asymmetric costs and benefits for the two contracting parties, particularly given they do not share the same interests in the removal of unauthorized aliens. With specific reference to the Euro-North African context, the authors set out to explain the cumulative factors and the overriding driving forces that have contributed to the growth and geographical expansion of the cobweb of bilateral agreements linked to readmission. They also highlight the gaps that may exist between reciprocal commitments and effective actions as well as between the drive for operability and the respect for human rights.

25|$|By the 1850s, {{fears of}} an American {{invasion}} {{had begun to}} diminish, and the British felt able to start reducing {{the size of their}} garrison. The <b>Reciprocity</b> <b>Treaty,</b> negotiated between Canada and the United States in 1854, further helped to alleviate concerns. However, tensions picked up again during the American Civil War (1861–65), reaching a peak with the Trent Affair of late 1861 and early 1862, touched off when the captain of a US gunboat stopped the RMS Trent and removed two Confederate officials who were bound for Britain. The British government was outraged and, with war appearing imminent, took steps to reinforce its North American garrison, increasing it from a strength of 4,000 to 18,000. However, war was averted and the sense of crisis subsided. This incident proved to be the final major episode of Anglo-American military confrontation in North America, as both sides increasingly became persuaded of the benefits of amicable relations. At the same time, many Canadians went south to fight in the Civil War, with most joining the Union side, although some were sympathetic toward the Confederacy.|$|E

He was the first reigning monarch to visit America during his 1874 visit to Washington, D.C. for negotiations on the <b>Reciprocity</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 1875. The state dinner in his honor hosted by President Ulysses S. Grant was the first White House state dinner ever given. According to the personal writings of Queen Dowager Emma, a political opponent of his, Kalākaua supposedly had the intention in 1874 of making a world tour [...] "for his personal gratification and vanity".|$|E
500|$|When the King {{was visiting}} England on July 15, the Sacramento Daily Record-Union reprinted a {{defensive}} July 14 editorial in The New York Times stating the rumor as fact that Kalākaua was circumnavigating {{the world in}} hopes of finding a buyer for the islands: [...] "… Virtually, the United States has a mortgage upon the Sandwich Islands… we have a monopoly of trade of the islands, both as imports and exports…". The trade monopoly referred to was Article IV of the <b>Reciprocity</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 1875, which prevented Hawaii from making a like treaty with any other nation. The editorial stated that any act of acquiring the Hawaiian Islands would be viewed by the United States government as an unfriendly act.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{following}} {{the signing of}} the legislation, he visited each major island in the kingdom for a personal look at how the <b>reciprocity</b> <b>treaty</b> had affected his people. In a speech before an audience of Native Hawaiians at a Congregational church on Kauai, Kalākaua related his concerns, [...] "I will speak to you of one of our great questions, which is the supply of people, not only to meet the requirements of all our industries but to assist in the increase of a Hawaiian population." [...] He wanted to bring in Austronesian immigrants from Asia-Pacific nations to save the declining population of the Hawaiian race from completely dying out. Prior labor immigration had been mostly unmarried men, and he hoped to attract unmarried women as potential wives for them, as well as bringing in family groups.|$|E

Fellow civil war veteran Alfred S. Hartwell was their host, {{who was on the}} kingdom's supreme court at the time. They recognized the great potential of Pearl Harbor as a [...] "harbor of refuge in time of war," [...] and on May 8, 1873, recommended that the War Department acquire the harbor. Their suggestion resulted in the signing of the <b>reciprocity</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 1875 between the United States and Hawaii. As part of the treaty, Hawaii ceded the area of Pearl Harbor to the United States in return for trade agreements benefiting Hawaiian sugar planters. The treaty was signed on September 8, 1876, helping pave the way for eventual American annexation of the Kingdom.|$|E

[...] Nevertheless, his influence extended to later American acquisitions. One of his friends, Hamilton Fish, in 1875 signed the trade <b>reciprocity</b> <b>treaty</b> with the Kingdom of Hawaii that eventually led to American annexation of the islands. [...] William Everts, another Seward friend, in 1877 signed a treaty of friendship with the Samoan Islands, laying the groundwork for another American acquisition. [...] A young friend and protege of Seward, Lincoln's assistant private secretary, John Hay, served as a successor of Seward from 1898 to 1905, during which time the U.S. acquired Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Philippines, and the Panama Canal Zone.|$|E

Minister of Foreign Affairs John Adams Cummins reported that the trip was solely for the king's health and would not extend beyond California, while local newspapers and the British commissioner James Hay Wodehouse speculated that the king might go further east to Washington, D.C. to negotiate a treaty to extend the existing exclusive US access rights to Pearl Harbor, or the annexation of the kingdom. The McKinley Tariff Act had crippled the Hawaiian sugar industry by removing the duties on sugar imports from other countries into the US, eliminating the previous Hawaiian duty-free advantage under the <b>Reciprocity</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 1875. After failing to persuade the king to stay, Liliʻuokalani wrote that he and Hawaiian ambassador to the United States Henry A. P. Carter planned to discuss the tariff situation in Washington.
