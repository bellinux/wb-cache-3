40|$|Fugitive dust has {{the ability}} to cause a {{nuisance}} and pollute the ambient environment, particularly from human activities including construction and industrial sites and mining operations. As such, dustfall monitoring has occurred for many decades in South Africa; little has been published on the repeatability, uncertainty, accuracy and precision of dustfall monitoring. Repeatability assesses the consistency associated with the results of a particular measurement under the same conditions; the consistency of the laboratory is assessed to determine the uncertainty associated with dustfall monitoring conducted by the laboratory. The aim {{of this study was to}} improve the understanding of the uncertainty in dustfall monitoring; thereby improving the confidence in dustfall monitoring. Uncertainty of dustfall monitoring was assessed through a 12 -month study of 12 sites that were located on the boundary of the study area. Each site contained a directional dustfall sampler, which was modified by removing the rotating lid, with four buckets (A, B, C and D) installed. Having four buckets on one stand allows for each bucket to be exposed to the same conditions, for the same period of time; therefore, should have equal amounts of dust deposited in these buckets. The difference in the weight (mg) of the dust recorded from each bucket at each respective site was determined using the American Society for Testing and Materials method D 1739 (ASTM D 1739). The variability of the dust would provide the confidence level of dustfall monitoring when <b>reporting</b> <b>to</b> <b>clients...</b>|$|E

Research purpose: This article investigates the use of storytelling {{as a tool for}} actionable reporting by South African marketing research firms Motivation for the study: Clients of marketing research firms often criticise research reports as being too technical and lacking in strategic value. Storytelling is a reporting technique {{that can be used to}} develop actionable research and provide clients with more strategic value. Research design, approach and method: A total of 26 in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with client service directors and managers of marketing research firms that deliver quantitative research <b>reports</b> <b>to</b> <b>clients.</b> Main findings: Results indicated that all marketing research firms but one use storytelling. Barriers that impede more regular use are inexperienced research executives and the time intensity associated with creating stories. Practical/managerial implications: Storytelling should be used by marketing research firms <b>to</b> provide <b>clients</b> with more actionable research. Contribution/value-add: The study provides marketing research firms in South Africa with recommendations as to how to implement storytelling as a reporting technique, which will add value <b>to</b> <b>clients</b> and enable marketing research firms to remain competitive and develop relationships with clients.   </span...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} feature {{that is expected}} to be owned by today's mobile computing systems is the ability of processing location-dependent continuous queries on moving objects. The result of a location-dependent query depends on the current location of the mobile client which has generated the query as well as the locations of the moving objects on which the query has been issued. When a location-dependent query is specified to be continuous, the result of the query can continuously change. In order to provide accurate and timely query results <b>to</b> a <b>client,</b> the location of the client as well as the locations of moving objects in the system has to be closely monitored. Most of the location generation methods proposed in the literature aim to optimize utilization of the limited wireless bandwidth. The issues of correctness and timeliness of query results <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> <b>clients</b> have been largely ignored. In this paper, we propose an adaptive monitoring method (AMM) and a deadline-driven method (DDM) for managing the locations of moving objects. The aim of our methods is to generate location updates with the consideration of maintaining the correctness of query evaluation results without increasing location update workload. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed methods as compared to a well-known location update generation method, the plain dead-reckoning (pdr). © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Most {{studies of}} news {{flow to the}} United States have {{analyzed}} the content of newspapers, other print media, or wire services (Hester, 1971, 1974; Vilani-lam, 1972). Yet the available evidence shows a trend toward greater reliance on television {{as a source of}} news when compared with print media. Studies conducted for the Television Information Office between 1959 and 1974, as well as newspaper industry sponsored studies, confirm the trend (Roper, 1975; A <b>Report</b> <b>to</b> <b>Client,</b> 1974). Television is clearly a major source of inter-national affairs news and an important indicator of news flow to the United States. Of the few studies that have examined television network news coverage of other nations, Almaney (1970) focused on a limited time period, one month during 1969, and Hester (1976) documented the origination of foreign news, its content, and its volume. A problem with the interpretation of studies like these is their use of fundamentally different measures. Hester (1976) examines only foreign news, rather narrowly defined as only that news with a foreign dateline in the Television News Index and Abstracts. This measure ignores a significant proportion of all international news, the stories reported from Washington, D. C. locations like the State Department, Pentagon, or White House.

This can facilitate teleconferences between team members and be used to communicate information and ideas.
