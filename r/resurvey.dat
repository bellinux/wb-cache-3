25|$|A <b>resurvey</b> of Grinnell's {{original}} route {{was begun}} {{by the museum}} to research, document and model changes in the distribution and habits of animal species in the timespan between the early 1900s and the current century. The Kern River Valley area, called the Whitney transect, was studied in June and September 2008 and in May 2009 by the <b>resurvey</b> teams. The original Grinnell 1911-1914 field notes are online and searchable. (See External links section.) Parts of the <b>resurvey</b> of California are completed, including Yosemite National Park, and show changing trends in wildlife territory and range; some expanding, some contracting and some species moving to higher elevations.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} year (1869), at its June 2 meeting, the Board directed road engineer Haydon to <b>resurvey</b> road location from Littlestown to the state line. Haydon completed his <b>resurvey</b> and in December,1869 the Board approved relocating the line from Gitt's alignment along Israel Creek (the east-side route) thru Woodsboro, Walkersville and into Frederick city to Haydon's west-side alignment along Glade Creek. The Board ordered a review on the Harmony Grove segment in the Spring of 1870, but {{by the fall of}} 1870, Haydon's <b>resurvey</b> was complete and on September 27, 1870: Haydon presented his report on the west and east line location study with the east line in Frederick city connecting with the B being adopted.|$|E
25|$|In the Yosemite transect, no {{significant}} change in avian species abundance was found. Grinnell documented 133 species and the <b>resurvey</b> team reported 140 bird species.|$|E

500|$|Jessee Walter Fewkes, {{the first}} {{archeologist}} to visit Puerco Ruin, predicted {{in the late}} 19thcentury that it would yield many artifacts. Conservationist John Muir conducted the first excavations of the ruin in 1905â€“06. Although he did not publish his findings, he urged {{the federal government to}} preserve Petrified Forest. Professional archeological work in the park began in the early 20thcentury when Walter Hough conducted excavations at Puerco Ruin and other sites. [...] In 1919, a phytosaur skull was discovered near Blue Mesa in the Petrified Forest and sent to the Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley, California. [...] In 1921, Annie Alexander, founder of the museum, visited Blue Mesa to collect more of the phytosaur and other specimens; this led to further excavations by paleontologist Charles Camp. [...] Since then, more than 250 fossil sites have been documented in the park. In the 1930s, the Civil Works Administration funded research in the park by archeologists H.P. Mera and C.B. Cosgrove. A National Park Service <b>resurvey</b> of the Petrified Forest in the early 1940s identified most of the large sites with stone ruins, and subsequent surveys since 1978 have identified a total of more than 600 artifact sites, many of them small. Research in paleontology and archeology continues at the park in the 21stcentury.|$|E
2500|$|The Museum of Vertebrate Zoology {{began the}} Grinnell <b>Resurvey</b> Project in 2002 using Grinnell's {{original}} survey of California fauna for comparison. [...] The <b>resurvey</b> team encountered difficulties, as the 2007 report on Yosemite noted [...] "the {{data from the}} original and current surveys cannot be directly compared because of differences in observer effort." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Yosemite <b>resurvey</b> {{documented}} {{shifts in}} the geographic ranges of some mammals. [...] The majority of change is to higher elevation by a ratio of [...] 2.5 to 1. A notable alteration in range is shown by the pinyon mouse (Peromyscus truei), where both {{the upper and lower}} range limits have moved upward in elevation. The <b>resurvey</b> biologists documented the pinyon mouse on Mount Lyell at elevation 10,500 feet. In Grinnell's Animal Life of the Yosemite, [...] the pinyon mouse (or big-eared white-footed mouse) is described as occurring in the Upper Sonoran Zone on the west slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.|$|E

As a result, in 1721, a new deed was issued to a much larger [...] and the property was renamed Belair (sometimes written as Bel Air).|$|E
2500|$|The <b>resurvey</b> report's {{section on}} birds noted {{problems}} in comparing the censuses: [...] "In the original survey {{there was a}} large difference in terms of birds observed per unit time between J. Grinnell and T. Storer, with Grinnell having much higher scores than Storer for the same area. Grinnell and Storer counts also had a larger variation among their own censuses for a single site than we did during our survey." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1798, John Carlysle Stewart, a civil engineer, {{traveled}} to western Pennsylvania to <b>resurvey</b> the [...] "donation lands," [...] {{which had been}} reserved for veterans of the Revolutionary War. He discovered that the original survey had neglected to stake out approximately [...] at {{the confluence of the}} Shenango River and the Neshannock Creek, at that time a part of Allegheny County. Claiming the land for himself, he laid out what was to become the town of New Castle. Stewart laid out the town of New Castle in April 1798. It comprised approximately that same , in what was then part of Allegheny County.|$|E

To resolve the new dispute, Iowa and Missouri jointly filed suit and asked the Supreme Court to once more intervene. [...] In State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 160 U.S. 688 (1896), the Court again established a commission (this time, adding a surveyor {{from the state of}} Illinois as well) to <b>resurvey</b> and remark the missing boundary line. The Court received the report of the second boundary commission, reviewed it at length, and accepted it as the true boundary in State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 165 U.S. 118 (1897).|$|E
2500|$|On July 13, 1896, {{the ship}} left New Bedford for surveys in Buzzards Bay that {{included}} establishing {{a new position}} for the Nantucket South Shoal lightship. Bache was undergoing repairs in New York when detailed to confirm improvement of the channel at the bar at Brunswick, Georgia, to a specified width and depth in a contract with a [...] "Mr. Goodyear", with [...] "the method of improvement being by the explosion of dynamite on the bottom." [...] Under {{an amendment to the}} river and harbor act of June 3, 1896, the Secretary of War was to supervise <b>resurvey</b> confirming the work by a qualified C officer. Repairs were rushed and Bache sailed December 19, 1876, for Brunswick, reaching St. Simons Sound on the 27th. Weather delayed the survey until January 4, 1897, which continued through an [...] "exceptionally stormy and unfavorable season" [...] until April 16 with measurement requirements of unusual detail down to tenths of feet with 39,000 soundings being made. The ship sailed for New York, arriving April 27, where office work on board until June 22 completed the special survey sheets.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile {{the hours}} passed. As the sun climbed the clear, steely lights vanished, the blue hazes deepened, and slowly the glistening {{surfaces}} of lava turned redder.
