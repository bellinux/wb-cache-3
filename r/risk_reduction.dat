40|$|International audienceEffective {{communication}} of risks requires a theoretical {{understanding of the}} influences of cognitive and task constraints. We present progress toward the identification of performance parameters in an experiment that explores the dynamic interplay of four key risk communication variables (i. e., cognitive strategies, numeracy, complexity, and format). Specifically, we conducted a protocol analysis to trace the types of cognitive strategies used when comparing the helpfulness of two treatments. Variability in cognitive strategies was also examined as related to (1) format (expressed either as absolute or relative <b>risk</b> <b>reductions</b> in either a frequency or single-event probability format); (2) task difficulty; and (3) numerical skill. Results indicated that highly numerate people often effectively used more complex strategies. However, the performance advantage of highly numerate people only existed when comparing two relative <b>risk</b> <b>reductions</b> (which requires a complex strategy), but not when comparing two absolute <b>risk</b> <b>reductions</b> (which requires a simple strategy). A frequency format was also found to produce additional benefits in very difficult tasks (i. e., when comparing absolute and relative <b>risk</b> <b>reductions).</b> Generally, although strategies and accuracy are influenced by many factors, risk communication tended to be most transparent when presented in terms of absolute <b>risk</b> <b>reductions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Author(s) 2015. Background. Lower {{numerical}} ability {{is associated with}} poorer understanding of health statistics, such as <b>risk</b> <b>reductions</b> of medical treatment. For many people, despite good numeracy skills, math provokes anxiety that impedes an ability to evaluate numerical information. Math-anxious individuals also report less {{confidence in their ability}} to perform math tasks. We hypothesized that, independent of objective numeracy, math anxiety would be associated with poorer responding and lower confidence when calculating <b>risk</b> <b>reductions</b> of medical treatments. Methods. Objective numeracy was assessed using an 11 -item objective numeracy scale. A 13 -item self-report scale was used to assess math anxiety. In experiment 1, participants were asked to interpret the baseline risk of disease and <b>risk</b> <b>reductions</b> associated with treatment options. Participants in experiment 2 were additionally provided a graphical display designed to facilitate the processing of math information and alleviate effects of math anxiety. Confidence ratings were provided on a 7 -point scale. Results. Individuals of higher objective numeracy were more likely to respond correctly to baseline <b>risks</b> and <b>risk</b> <b>reductions</b> associated with treatment options and were more confident in their interpretations. Individuals who scored high in math anxiety were instead less likely to correctly interpret the baseline <b>risks</b> and <b>risk</b> <b>reductions</b> and were less confident in their risk calculations as well as in their assessments of the effectiveness of treatment options. Math anxiety predicted confidence levels but not correct responding when controlling for objective numeracy. The graphical display was most effective in increasing confidence among math-anxious individuals. Conclusions. The findings suggest that math anxiety is associated with poorer medical risk interpretation but is more strongly related to confidence in interpretations...|$|R

5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of estrogen and promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This <b>risk</b> <b>reduction</b> continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} fatal <b>risk</b> <b>reductions</b> {{is a vital}} input for road safety {{cost-benefit}} analysis and has been traditionally estimated by means of contingent valuation {{in spite of the}} growing criticism surrounding this approach. Furthermore, many scholars believe that risk-money trade-offs are not well understood because of the difficulty in internalizing tiny risks. In recent studies we have succeeded in applying the Stated Choice (SC) approach to tackle this problem. An SC survey requires respondents to choose among different hypothetical alternatives, characterized by a set of relevant attributes: in our approach one of these attributes is the number of crashes with fatal victims which serves as a proxy for risk. To assess the robustness of SC, we conducted an external validity test {{based on the results of}} three different studies. We investigated if preferences were well defined according to economic theory postulates (i. e. as baseline risk increases, marginal willingness-to-pay should be higher). We also addressed an issue which is usually ignored in transport theory and practice: should there be a unique value of fatal <b>risk</b> <b>reductions</b> for road safety? We found that people can internalize risk, expressed as fatal crashes, in a consistent way from an economic point of view. From the different values of <b>risk</b> <b>reductions</b> for each sample, we were able to establish a well defined relationship between baseline risk and the value of <b>risk</b> <b>reductions.</b> Finally, we offer a hypothesis to explain the differences between our values and figures obtained in developed countries, highlighting the importance of conducting local studies rather than transferring imported values. Our evidence could be most helpful within the context of developing countries. ...|$|R
