5|$|Charles Marowitz created A Macbeth in 1969, a {{streamlined}} {{version of}} the play which requires only eleven actors. The production strongly suggests that Lady Macbeth is in league with the witches. One scene shows her leading the three to a firelight incantation. In Eugène Ionesco's satirical {{version of the}} play Macbett (1972), one of the witches <b>removes</b> <b>a</b> costume to reveal that she is, in fact, Lady Duncan, and wants to be Macbeth's mistress. Once Macbeth is King and they are married, however, she abandons him, revealing {{that she was not}} Lady Duncan all along, but a witch. The real Lady Duncan appears and denounces Macbeth as a traitor.|$|E
5|$|In 2014 the State Historic Preservation Board {{considered}} a boundary adjustment that <b>removes</b> <b>a</b> small {{area at the}} northeast corner but adds far more, primarily at the southeast. It would include a total of 200 new contributing properties and extend the district's period of significance to 1978, {{to take into account}} the city's urban renewal era. Most of the new areas had been found to be consistent with those already included in the district or accidentally excluded when the district was originally designated. Two years later the National Park Service officially approved the expansion.|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{finds an}} ice core sample {{believed}} to originate from a meteor crater, and theorizes {{that the sample}} might be 250,000 years old. Although Bear insists on leaving, the others are concerned about infecting the outside world. When he is asked to provide a stool sample, he attacks Mulder and tries to flee. Something moves under Bear's skin, and he dies when Hodge <b>removes</b> <b>a</b> small worm {{from the back of}} his neck. Now without a pilot, the group is informed that evacuation is impossible because of the weather.|$|E

5|$|Phillip Padgett (John Hawkes), {{a fledgling}} author, {{sits at a}} desk, {{suffering}} from writer's block. He eventually retires {{to the bathroom to}} discard a spent cigarette. Without warning or concern, the man suddenly reaches into his chest and <b>removes</b> <b>a</b> bloody heart. Later, he walks down metal stairs into a cluttered basement, and opens the door of an incinerator. Noticing a beating heart amidst the flames, and unfazed by the vision, he nonchalantly tosses in a paper bag.|$|E
5|$|Cord goes to {{the uranium}} mine to locate Kiefer, but finds him dead. While there, he overhears a {{conversation}} between Chi-Ling Cheung (a secret agent of the People's Republic of China) and Byrdoy Tolstov (a professor in applied physics and chemistry). Tolstov reveals {{that they are not}} mining for uranium, but that they are experimenting with a special compound called tri-nepheline. Tolstov's daughter Alexandria is being held hostage at Security Headquarters (HQ), and Cord rescues her with the help of Chi, who is suspected of being a spy. Afterwards, Cord plants a bug on a secure server and <b>removes</b> <b>a</b> hard drive containing information relating to the VFF. Cord {{goes to the}} Containment Facility to apprehend Nagarov.|$|E
5|$|During the party, Tony Yayo enters {{another room}} of the mansion and <b>removes</b> <b>a</b> {{painting}} {{from one of the}} walls, revealing a hidden safe: after opening it and removing a silver necklace, a woman (Buffie Carruth) who has followed him from the party enters the room and the pair begin to embrace. At this point, the police suddenly enter the room, searching for Tony Yayo, although it is shown that he has escaped just in time through an open door in the room. Reunited in the Mercedes-Benz with 50 Cent, Tony Yayo gives the necklace to 50 Cent: at this point, Tony Yayo abruptly wakes up, in his jail cell, showing the preceding events of the video to have been a dream.|$|E

5|$|Melvin Frohike visits Scully's {{apartment}} and shows her {{a newspaper article}} about Kenneth Soona's murder. When she returns to FBI headquarters, the metal detector curiously goes off. Scully presents Skinner with the newspaper article, thinking that the data from Soona's death can clear Mulder in his father's murder. Skinner, however, refuses to do any follow-up on it. After Scully leaves it is revealed that the Cigarette Smoking Man was waiting in an adjacent room to question Skinner about the exchange. Leaving the building, Scully has a hunch upon seeing the metal detector again that leads to locating metal {{in the back of}} her neck. Scully sees a doctor, who <b>removes</b> <b>a</b> small metal implant.|$|E
5|$|Ten days earlier, at Honolulu Airport, a courier {{returning}} from the Republic of Georgia (David Bloom) is searched by customs officers. One of the officers (Andy Thompson) <b>removes</b> <b>a</b> glass canister from the courier's briefcase and accidentally shatters it, exposing both men to the black oil. Meanwhile, in New York City, Mulder and Scully take part in an FBI raid against a domestic terrorist group. Mulder's tipster within the group is revealed to be Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), whom the terrorists released from the missile silo {{where he had been}} trapped. Krycek has turned against The Smoking Man (William B. Davis), and tells the distrustful agents that he can help expose him.|$|E
5|$|Izzie {{supports}} Alex when {{he discovers}} his new girlfriend has psychiatric problems, and convinces {{him to have}} her committed. She is also handed primary responsibility for the clinic, as Bailey cuts back on her responsibilities. Izzie and Alex go on to rekindle their relationship, though Izzie is concerned when she begins hallucinating Denny. She discovers she has metastatic melanoma (Stage IV) which has spread to her liver, skin, and brain, causing the hallucinations. Her survival chances are estimated at only 5%. She is admitted to Seattle Grace as a patient, and Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) successfully <b>removes</b> <b>a</b> tumor from her brain. Izzie spends her time in the hospital planning Meredith and Derek's wedding, but when her condition worsens and Derek discovers a second brain tumor, they give the ceremony to Izzie and Alex, who marry {{in front of all}} their friends. The procedure to remove the second tumor from Izzie's brain causes her to lose her short-term memory, and although she soon regains it, she flatlines moments later. The fifth season ends with her friends ignoring her DNR order and attempting to resuscitate her, transposed with images of Izzie in an elevator encountering George, who has been in an accident and is also currently flatlining. Though George dies, Izzie is resuscitated and recovers enough to return to work.|$|E

25|$|Calcineurin is a -activated {{phosphatase}} (enzyme that <b>removes</b> <b>a</b> {{phosphate group}} from substrate) that regulates cardiac hypertrophy. Regulation occurs through NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) activation, which, when dephosphorylated, binds to GATA and forms a transcription factor (protein that can bind DNA and alter {{the expression of}} DNA) with ability to control the hypertrophic gene (2). Activation of calcineurin causes increases in hypertrophy.|$|E
25|$|Interstitial {{deletion}}s: an intra-chromosomal deletion that <b>removes</b> <b>a</b> {{segment of}} DNA {{from a single}} chromosome, thereby apposing previously distant genes. For example, cells isolated from a human astrocytoma, a type of brain tumor, {{were found to have}} a chromosomal deletion removing sequences between the Fused in Glioblastoma (FIG) gene and the receptor tyrosine kinase (ROS), producing a fusion protein (FIG-ROS). The abnormal FIG-ROS fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes oncogenic transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells).|$|E
25|$|The {{reddening}} {{of the sun}} is intensified when it is {{near the}} horizon because the light being received directly from it must pass through more of the atmosphere. The effect is further increased because the sunlight must pass through {{a greater proportion of}} the atmosphere nearer the earth's surface, where it is denser. This <b>removes</b> <b>a</b> significant proportion of the shorter wavelength (blue) and medium wavelength (green) light from the direct path to the observer. The remaining unscattered light is therefore mostly of longer wavelengths and appears redder.|$|E

The subsequent ballot in 2011 showed the first sub-20% total of 115 votes (19.8%), and McGwire's total votes continued to decline (112 votes (19.5%) in 2012, 96 votes (16.9%) in 2013, 63 votes (11.0%) in 2014, and 55 votes (10.0%) in 2015) until he was finally eliminated after receiving only 54 votes (12.3%) in 2016.|$|E
50|$|Iodine has a {{nutritional}} relationship with selenium.

Both of the latter are inactivated hormones which are ready for disposal and have essentially no biological effects. A family of non-selenium dependent enzymes then further deiodinates the products of these reactions.|$|R
