40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{emergence}} of regional policy initiatives designed to stimulate learning, innovation and regional development in Europe’s less favoured regions. Drawing on the European Commission-sponsored Wales <b>Regional</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Plan</b> as a case study, it examines progress and outcomes using the conceptual framework of regional experimentalism. The article concludes that the Wales RTP has helped to develop significant interactive learning processes among the regional state, firms and intermediaries. Important questions, however, are raised {{as to whether the}} RTP process in Wales has engendered the sufficiently path-breaking forms of dialogue anticipated by theorists. In this respect, the article suggests that regional experimentalism under-estimates the problems associated with creating novel policy processes in environments characterized by well entrenched interests and responsibilities...|$|E

The development of instructional <b>technology</b> <b>plans</b> has been an area of concern among school districts throughout Illinois. Previous research had not generally considered the components necessary to formulate an instructional <b>technology</b> <b>plan.</b> This study focused on three research questions related to the formation of a <b>technology</b> <b>plan.</b> What were the components of <b>technology</b> <b>plans?</b> Who was included in the <b>technology</b> <b>planning</b> process? What was the role of the school library media specialist in developing and implementing a technology plan?This descriptive study analyzed the <b>technology</b> <b>plans</b> and interviewed administrators and school library media specialists from twenty schools with "lighthouse" technology programs. The study also surveyed twenty-four school library media specialists from non-lighthouse schools to provide comparative data with the school library media specialists from the lighthouse technology schools. The major findings of this study included the following points: (a) staff development for technology must be considered by the <b>technology</b> <b>planning</b> team, including how to find the time and resources necessary for the success of the program; (b) ongoing revision of the <b>technology</b> <b>plan</b> must be considered when developing a <b>technology</b> <b>plan</b> or the plan {{will not be able to}} keep up with changes in technology; (c) access to technology for both teachers and students is a factor in the implementation of a technology plan; (d) the development of a support structure for technology is a factor in the implementation of a technology plan; (e) at a minimum, the <b>technology</b> <b>planning</b> team should include representation from administration, teaching staff, and school library media specialists; and (f) lighthouse technology schools were more likely to have high quality school library media programs, as measured on Loertscher's Taxonomy of School Library Media Programs, than other schools.

40|$|Abstract – Since {{liberalization}} {{was introduced}} in the year 1991, Indian cities have been experiencing an accelerated pace of growth. This has created opportunities for technocrats and planners alike to guide and develop the process of planned development and management of cities. Efficient urban information system is a vital pre-requisite for planned development as the ever increasing demands in urban planning and management call for co-ordinate application of Geographic Information System (GIS), for sustainable development of urban areas. The availability of satellite images from Google earth has revolutionized the process of thematic mapping and spatial data base creation, specially, in the context of urban and <b>regional</b> <b>planning.</b> <b>Technologies</b> such as GIS have emerged as a powerful tool in integrating and analyzing the various thematic layers along with attribute information to create various planning scenarios for decision making. The ability of GIS to store, manage and manipulate large amounts of spatial data provides urban planners with a powerful tool. This paper focuses on how GIS can be applied to establish, maintain, and analyze urban and land-use information for location and development of industries, educational institutions, housing, water supply, service facilities, sewer systems, etc. The present case study involves the suburbs of Boduppal and Pirzadiguda in Hyderabad city of the state of Andhra Pradesh in India...|$|R

40|$|Planning is {{regarded}} as a common and standard practice both in the industry and science. There is a wide range of different planning areas in companies, such as sales planning, personnel planning, procurement <b>planning,</b> marketing <b>planning,</b> <b>technology</b> <b>planning</b> etc. The significance of each area varies depending for instance on the industry sector, organizational structure, economic situation. For technology-oriented companies <b>technology</b> <b>planning</b> is of essential importance, as it defines which technologies need to be provided fo which period in order to produce certain products. In an increasingly complex environment <b>technology</b> <b>planning</b> supports companies to master the overall complexity as it creates transparency over technological strategies and objectives. Further, <b>technology</b> <b>planning</b> give s an overview of company-relevant technologies and the corresponding activities such as research and development activities, e. g. via technology-roadmaps. Often the question arises how companies can conduct their <b>technology</b> <b>planning</b> more effectively and efficiently as well as in accordance to their contextual framework. Technology managers demand for more guidance respective how to set up their <b>technology</b> <b>planning</b> espacially in terms of changed markets and technological environments, e. g. in times of leaps in technology. Examples for disruptive technologies are analog cameras relative to digital cameras, cellular phones to wired phones, MP 3 -Player to Portable CD-Player. Against the background of growing competitive pressure, more complex technology chains, increasing derivatization, reduce d product and technology life cycles, <b>technology</b> <b>planning</b> in contrast to general planning strongly focuses on factors influencing its technological competitiveness, such as technology development of e. g. competitors. A lot of work has been accomplished in the field of planning and planning approaches in general. But only very few of these works have included technological aspects in terms of context and design possibilities. This aspect, i. e. different objects of observation depicts the major difference between the disciplines of general planning and the more specific <b>technology</b> <b>planning.</b> Based on the fact, that little systematic knowledge is available respective a <b>technology</b> <b>planning</b> approach, its design dimensions and contextual factors, a well-established and often applied approach of g eneral planning will be investigated. The aim {{of this paper is to}} give a judgement whether the approach, the synoptical and incremental approach suit for being transferred to the discipline of <b>technology</b> <b>planning.</b> A literature review gives a better understanding of the approach's characteristics. Further research paths for <b>technology</b> <b>planning</b> will be recommended in order to fill the gap both in science and practice...|$|R

There are four important dimensions of educational technology: technology, students, teachers, and educational goals. How each of the aspects is viewed and presented in the <b>technology</b> <b>plans</b> influences decisions on hardware and software purchases, strategies for teacher professional development, formulation of teaching objectives, as well as development of learning opportunities for students.

National governments and history strongly influence the present political power of the regions of Europe and thus the environment of firms.

Focusing on <b>regional</b> <b>technology</b> policies in one old Land, Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, and one new Land, Thuringia, in Germany in the mid- 1990 s, three main questions are asked in this article. First, what are the objectives, actors, instruments and strategies of regional tech-nology policies in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg and Thuringia and how much political autonomy do these L&auml;nder have to devise their own policies? Secondly, what are the effects of <b>regional</b> <b>technology</b> policies in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg and Thuringia on regional economic development? Thirdly, to what extent do <b>regional</b> <b>technology</b> policies in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg and Thuringia tackle specific regional economic prob-lems? The main conclusion is that both in Baden-W&uuml;rttemberg, a Land with a long tradition in tech-nology policy and large economic problems, and in Thuringia, a new Land with an economy which suf-fered heavily from restructuring, <b>regional</b> <b>technology</b> policies have limited impacts on regional economies in transition...|$|R
