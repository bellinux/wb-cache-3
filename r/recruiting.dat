5|$|At the outset, the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and USCG {{agreed to}} recruit and to train the members of their {{respective}} women's reserves together, using existing Navy facilities. For <b>recruiting</b> purposes, the SPARS would utilize the Offices of the Naval Officer Procurement. Their first <b>recruiting</b> efforts got underway in December 1942, but they were hampered somewhat {{by the absence of}} SPAR <b>recruiting</b> personnel. Their absence resulted from the agreement between the Navy and the USCG, whereby the SPARS would receive its first personnel by transfer from the WAVES. A total of 15 WAVE officers and 153 WAVE enlisted women requested and were discharged from the WAVES to become the first SPARS. Eventually, SPAR officers were assigned to most of the Naval Officer Procurement offices. The <b>recruiting</b> information about SPARS was disseminated with WAVES publicity materials and it was also done separately. But it became apparent that the job of selling the SPARS included selling the USCG as well.|$|E
5|$|Berger's evasion of Wehrmacht-imposed <b>recruiting</b> {{restrictions}} {{came to a}} head in June, {{when the}} Chief of the OKW Operations Staff, Generalmajor Alfred Jodl initiated an investigation of SS <b>recruiting</b> operations within the Reich. The result was that around 15,000 SS inductions were held up by various Wehrmacht military district headquarters. Berger became aware of Jodl's inquiry and advised Himmler that even their inquiries had underestimated his success, giving the example that the Wehrmacht believed he had exceeded the June quota for SS-Division-Totenkopf by 900 men, when in fact the true figure was 1,164. He boasted to Himmler that during the whole <b>recruiting</b> campaign, he had signed up 15,000 men for SS-Division-Totenkopf, when Hitler had only authorised the <b>recruiting</b> of 4,000 for the division in the same period. To justify his actions, Berger pointed to the fact that, just before the French surrender, Hitler had ordered the release of over-age SS reservists. In the SS-Division-Totenkopf, this meant 13,246 of the 20,000-strong formation.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study {{is designed to}} quantitatively and qualitatively measure <b>recruit</b> resilience at Naval <b>Recruit</b> Training Command (RTC) and to develop interventions that will increase <b>recruit</b> resilience. This study administered three resilience-building interventions to 713 <b>recruits</b> across eight divisions and collected surveys at four time intervals to measure changes in self-reported resilience. We conducted interviews with <b>recruits</b> and <b>Recruit</b> Division Commanders (RDCs) to gather qualitative data on significant factors that affect the resilience-building process. Our quantitative analysis methods included difference mean tests, regression analysis, and correlation analysis to determine the most effective interventions. Qualitative analysis methods are used to provide insight on <b>recruit</b> behavior, mental state, and internal resilience. Our quantitative results suggest that Appreciative Guided Conversations using positive, meaningful experience-based questions yield significant increases in <b>recruit</b> resilience. Our qualitative analysis revealed numerous enablers, disablers, and facilitators (RDCs) that impact the <b>recruit</b> resilience process. The influence of family and religion cannot be overstated as sources that {{have a positive effect}} in a <b>recruit’s</b> resilience process. We recommend that RTC implement a long-term resilience intervention program of Appreciative Guided Conversations for all <b>recruits.</b> By improving <b>recruit</b> resilience, RTC can graduate stronger, healthier <b>recruits</b> who will positively contribute to fleet readiness.

5|$|Beginning in 1940, Himmler {{opened up}} Waffen-SS <b>recruiting</b> to ethnic Germans {{that were not}} German citizens. In March 1941, the SS Main Office {{established}} the Germanische Leitstelle (Germanic Guidance Office) to establish Waffen-SS <b>recruiting</b> offices in Nazi-occupied Europe. The majority of the resulting foreign Waffen-SS units wore a distinctive national collar patch and preceded their SS rank titles with the prefix Waffen instead of SS. Volunteers from Scandinavian countries filled the ranks of two divisions, the SS-Wiking and SS-Nordland. Belgian Flemings joined Dutchmen to form the SS-Nederland legion, and their Walloon compatriots joined the SS-Wallonien. By the end of 1943 {{about a quarter of}} the SS were ethnic Germans from across Europe, and by June 1944, half the Waffen-SS were foreign nationals.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} May 1940, Berger {{had filled}} the {{authorised}} quota of new recruits, but his recruiters kept signing up young men to create a reserve that could replace the many older Allgemeine SS reservists in the three field divisions. To supplement this pool, Berger also continued <b>recruiting</b> for the SS-TV and police regiments, which were not under Wehrmacht control, and were still below the strengths approved by Hitler. This continued to create friction between the Wehrmacht and SS, as potential Wehrmacht recruits were siphoned off to forces under Himmler's control. By a range of methods, Berger diverted manpower from the younger age groups, and also targeted areas outside the Reich that were not subject to Wehrmacht <b>recruiting</b> controls.|$|E
