The {{purpose of this}} action is to maintain suitable protection for walruses on <b>Round</b> <b>Island</b> and Cape Peirce, restore access to vessels with FFPs serving as tenders for the northern Bristol Bay herring and salmon fisheries to the routes used by tenders before implementation of GOA FMP Amendment 83, to allow vessels delivering groundfish access to the route north of <b>Round</b> <b>Island,</b> and to {{reduce the likelihood of}} disturbance to walrus on Hagemeister Island and Cape Peirce. Alternatives include: 1) no action – vessels with FFPs remain excluded from the walrus protection area, 2) open portion of the <b>Round</b> <b>Island</b> walrus protection area to transit with three options of increasing distance and 3) open portion of the Cape Peirce walrus protection area to transit. Three transit options are considered under Alternative 2 : 1) open up to 3 nm from <b>Round</b> <b>Island,</b> 2) open up to 4. 5 nm from <b>Round</b> <b>Island,</b> and 3) open up to 6 nm fro...|$|R
