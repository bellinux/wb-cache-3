Two {{types of assistance}} are considered: simple relaying and <b>regenerative</b> <b>repeater.</b> We find minimum transmit power levels to provision the same bit error rate (BER) in both cases.

40|$|The {{performance}} of a TFM scheme applied to a satellite downlink with an on-board <b>regenerative</b> <b>repeater</b> is evaluated by using a time domain simulation software package TOPSIM III. The TFM bit error rate {{in the presence of}} nonlinearities and adjacent channel interference is evaluated by means of semianalytic methods. The capabilities of convolutional codes for reducing the overall channel bit error rate are also investigated. Design guidelines are finally outlined for advanced satellite communication systems in which the joint use of nonconventional modulation schemes (like TFM) and of convolutional codes results in improved performance with respect to both bandwidth exploitation and system flexibilit...|$|E

In 1991, the North Pacific Cable system {{was the first}} <b>regenerative</b> (<b>repeatered)</b> system to completely cross the Pacific from the US mainland to Japan. The US portion of NPC was manufactured in Portland, Oregon, from 1989 to 1991 at STC Submarine Systems, and later Alcatel Submarine Networks. The system was laid by Cable & Wireless Marine on the CS Cable Venture.|$|R
40|$|EDFAs can {{overcome}} losses in long fiber-optic links {{independent of the}} digital bit rate, and can amplify multiple signals in a wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) system architecture. As more and more EDFAs are deployed, designers add new features, creating {{a need for more}} sophisticated testing. This paper provides a brief survey of the tests required to characterize EDFAs. A small child in California calls her grandmother in Germany. To her, the call seems effortless and Grandma sounds as if she is right there. A teenager in Arkansas is surfing the Net to find out about the latest in skateboard parks for a trip planned for the upcoming summer. A retired auto worker in Japan checks e-mail to see if a message from an old coworker has arrived confirming their upcoming fishing trip. These common, everyday events are only possible because of the vast deployment of capacity on the global communications network. Fiber-optics technology is the heart of this “information superhighway ” which spans the globe. Its tremendous capacity for carrying information in digital form is revolutionizing the way people live and work. Linked with cellular phone systems and computers around the world, this network provides access to incomprehensible amounts of information and vast connectivity. The most recent element adding to the success of these systems is the fiber-optic amplifier. Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers The development of erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) technology has greatly changed the design methodology of fiber-optic system designers. Traditional fiber-optic systems used <b>regenerative</b> <b>repeaters</b> to boost the signals, as shown in Figure 1 a. When the length of the link exceeded the practical single-span passive limit, these <b>regenerative</b> <b>repeaters</b> detected the signal and retransmitted it with a laser, restoring the signal level as well as the signa...|$|R

Key features of the model are the collaborating instructor embracing students, a smart classroom equipped with a "Whiteboard" and advanced telecommunication networks, electronic textbook, and other resources, World Wide Web (WWW), Matlab, and other online tools. The underlying assumptions of the educational process are teambuilding instead of independent learning, collaborating/ supervising instructor, lateral curriculum instead of a vertical curriculum, and idea-to-product design concept. We will present a sample lecture in the proposed interactive classroom, where the concept of eye diagrams in <b>regenerative</b> <b>repeaters</b> will be presented from the first author's text using matlab and WWW. 1.

Due to imperfect #ltering and channel separation in the group demodulator,intersymbol and interchannel interference are introduced into the demodulated output.

Several chains are implemented, each consisting of 64 MOS switches in series.

The switches are either nMOS transistors with an external gate voltage V, (Figure 6 a) or CMOS transfer gates (Figure 6 b). The voltage V, can be set above V, for lower resistance and to avoid voltage drop. To evaluate many repeater placements, NOR and FPGA performance is liited mainly by the delay of the programmable interconnection network [ll. This delay increases quadratically {{with the number of}} series switches, and is a problem esp cially when the programmable switches are implemented using MOS transistors, since these have an appreciable resistance and NAND gates are added at the clock input or in the delay loop suc...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a VSAT based approach for extending mobile communication access to rural communities {{in developing countries}} using VSAT and satellite technology. The rural areas are clustered into village community cells with each cluster being served by a non <b>regenerative</b> bidirectional <b>repeater</b> system. The telecommunication technology of choice is the GSM standard. Traffic from the rural areas is collated together at the access point which serves as an interface between the village community cells and the satellite. The access points perform a frequency translation moving the signal from the GSM band to the satellite band at the transmitter and vice versa at the receiver. The system maximizes the advantage of satellite communication technology over other types in linking remote areas to urban centers that are geographically far apart. The satellite then links the village cell to the operator’s network via a dedicated BTS in the urban area. The system {{has the advantage of}} being modular, scalable and solar powered due to the low traffic from rural areas...|$|R
