The first ten verses of chapter 5 summarize and restate the need for always practicing virtuous self-restraints (Yamas), observances (Niyamas), avoiding anger against anyone or anything, truthfully following Dharma, respecting and learning from the Guru (teacher), and pursuing the proper goals of life without craving for <b>rewards</b> <b>of</b> one's action.|$|E

Munday successfully appealed against his proscription. Midgegooroo, Yagan and their group immediately moved from their territory north towards the Helena Valley. On 17 May, Midgegooroo was captured on the Helena River. After a brief, informal trial, he was executed by firing squad. Yagan remained at large for over two months.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical investigation {{to study the}} relationship between the liquidity and the <b>reward</b> <b>of</b> board of directors on 136 selected firms listed on Tehran Stock Exchange over the period 2007 - 2011. The study considers nine different factors including return on assets (ROA), return on equities (ROE), Q-Tobin, changes of ROA and ROE, etc. In our study, there is a direct relationship between firm sizes with <b>reward</b> <b>of</b> board's directors. In addition, there is a direct relationship between changes <b>of</b> ROE with <b>reward</b> <b>of</b> board's directors. Moreover, there is a direct relationship between changes of operational cash flow with <b>reward</b> <b>of</b> board's directors. Finally, there is a direct relationship between changes of Q-Tobin ratio with <b>reward</b> <b>of</b> board's directors but the relationship was reverse for some years. These evidences confirm that there was a meaningful relationship between <b>rewarding</b> board <b>of</b> directors and share liquidity...|$|R

However, the journey enabled the children to experience to the full the cosmopolitan musical world, and gave them an outstanding education. In Wolfgang's case this would continue through further journeys in the following six years, prior to his appointment by the Prince-Archbishop as a court musician.|$|E
5|$|At {{least three}} aspects of flowers {{appear to have}} coevolved between {{flowering}} plants and insects, because they involve communication between these organisms. Firstly, flowers communicate with their pollinators by scent; insects use this scent to determine how far away a flower is, to approach it, and to identify where to land and finally to feed. Secondly, flowers attract insects with patterns of stripes leading to the <b>rewards</b> <b>of</b> nectar and pollen, and colours such as blue and ultraviolet, to which their eyes are sensitive; in contrast, bird-pollinated flowers tend to be red or orange. Thirdly, flowers such as some orchids mimic females of particular insects, deceiving males into pseudocopulation.|$|E
5|$|Huang Na {{went missing}} on 10 October 2004; she {{was last seen}} at a food court near the {{wholesale}} centre, barefoot and wearing a blue denim jacket and bermuda shorts. From 7 a.m. to past midnight every day for three weeks, Shuying looked across the island for her daughter. The police, including a Criminal Investigation Department team, conducted an intensive search for the girl, and police officers carried photographs of her while on their daily rounds. Volunteers formed search parties and Crime Library, a voluntary group dedicated to finding missing persons, distributed over 70,000 leaflets appealing for information. Two Singaporeans offered <b>rewards</b> <b>of</b> S$10,000 and S$5,000 for finding Huang Na, while the manager of an online design company set up a website to raise awareness and gather tip-offs. The search even extended to Malaysia, with volunteers putting up posters in the nearby cities of Johor Bahru and Kuala Lumpur.|$|E

5|$|The lone {{surviving}} Pipe roll from Henry I's reign, that of 1130, {{has been}} a popular subject of study. Recent investigations include Judith Green's search for evidence of Henry's financial system. Another historian, Stephanie Mooers Christelow, has studied the roll along with those from the reign of Henry II, looking for the exemptions and grants made by both kings to various royal favourites. Christelow has also studied the 1130 roll to see what light it can shine on Henry I's judicial system, {{as well as on}} the growth of royal courts during Henry's reign. The historian C. Warren Hollister used the 1130 Pipe roll to study the <b>rewards</b> <b>of</b> royal service during Henry's reign.|$|E
5|$|The rigors and <b>rewards</b> <b>of</b> pioneer life on {{the prairie}} {{are the subject of}} Giants in the Earth by Ole Rolvaag and the Little House series of children's books by Laura Ingalls Wilder. Small-town life is portrayed grimly by Sinclair Lewis in the novel Main Street, and more gently and affectionately by Garrison Keillor in his tales of Lake Wobegon. St. Paul native F. Scott Fitzgerald writes of the social insecurities and {{aspirations}} of the young city in stories such as Winter Dreams and The Ice Palace (published in Flappers and Philosophers). Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's epic poem The Song of Hiawatha was inspired by Minnesota and names many of the state's places and bodies of water. Minnesota native Robert Zimmerman (Bob Dylan) won the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E
5|$|In 1282, {{war with}} Wales broke out again; {{this time it}} would not be simply a punitive campaign, but a {{full-scale}} war of conquest. Initially, the king wanted to fight the war with paid forces, but the nobility insisted {{on the use of the}} feudal summons. To men like Hereford, this was preferable, because as part of a feudal army the participants would have both a stake in the war and a justifiable claim on conquered land. In the end, although the earls won, none of them were paid for the war effort. Hereford jealously guarded his authority as hereditary Constable of England, and protested vigorously when the Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester was appointed commander of the forces in South Wales. In the post war settlement, however, neither Hereford nor Gloucester received any significant <b>rewards</b> <b>of</b> land, the way several other magnates did. Hereford fought again in Wales, in the suppression of the rebellion of 129495, when he again had to pacify the territory of Brecon before joining the king in the north.|$|E
