5000|$|If {{the first}} three notes are {{regarded}} as the [...] "original" [...] cell, then the next 3 are its transposed <b>retrograde-inversion</b> (backwards and upside down), the next three are the transposed retrograde (backwards), and the last 3 are its transposed inversion (upside down).|$|E
5000|$|A {{particular}} transformation (prime, inversion, retrograde, <b>retrograde-inversion)</b> {{together with}} a choice of transpositional level is referred to as a set form or row form. Every row thus has up to 48 different row forms. (Some rows have fewer due to symmetry; see the sections on derived rows and invariance below.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{permutations}} {{resulting from}} applying the inversion or retrograde operations are categorized {{as the prime}} forms inversions and retrogrades, respectively. Applying both inversion and retrograde to a prime form produces its <b>retrograde-inversions,</b> considered a distinct type of permutation.|$|R
5000|$|Permutation may {{be applied}} to smaller sets as well. However, {{transformation}} operations of such smaller sets do not necessarily result in permutation the original set. Here {{is an example of}} non-permutation of trichords, using retrogradation, inversion, and <b>retrograde-inversion,</b> combined in each case with transposition, as found within in the tone row (or twelve-tone series) from Anton Weberns Concerto: ...|$|E
50|$|Todd {{notes that}} {{although}} some composers (John Dunstaple, Guillaume Dufay and Johannes Ockeghem) used retrograde occasionally, {{they did not}} combine it with other permutations. In contradistinction, Antoine Busnois and Jacob Obrecht, used retrograde and other permutations extensively, suggesting familiarity with one another's compositional techniques. Todd also notes that, by use of retrograde, inversion, and <b>retrograde-inversion,</b> composers of this time viewed music in a way similar to serialists of the 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|Essentially, the {{treatise}} realizes [...] "a vast immutable {{development of}} the initial row" [...] that eschews traditional methods for developing a tone row (inversion, retrograde, and <b>retrograde-inversion).</b> [...] Two of Tremblay’s later works, Symphony No. 3 (ca. 1973) and The Phoenix: a Dance Symphony (1982), were composed in this manner. In fact, Tremblay described his third symphony as [...] "a textbook in actual sound {{of the process of}} this technique." ...|$|E
50|$|Tone rows are {{designated}} by letters and subscript numbers (e.g.: RI11, which may also appear as RI11 or RI-11). The numbers indicate the initial (P or I) or final (R or RI) pitch-class {{number of the}} given row form, most often with c=0. P indicates prime, a forward-directed right-side up form. I indicates inversion, a forward-directed upside-down form. R indicates retrograde, a backwards right-side up form. RI indicates <b>retrograde-inversion,</b> a backwards upside-down form. Transposition is indicated by a T number, for example P8 is a T(4) transposition of P4.|$|E
50|$|Inversional combinatoriality is a {{relationship}} between two rows, a principal row and its inversion. The principal rows first half, or six notes, are the inversions last six notes, though not necessarily in the same order. Thus, {{the first half of}} each row is the others complement. The same conclusion applies to each rows second half as well. When combined, these rows still maintain a fully chromatic feeling and dont tend to reinforce certain pitches as tonal centers as might happen with freely combined rows. For example, the row from Schoenbergs Moses und Aron, above contains: 0 1 4 5 6 7, this inverts to: 0 e 8 7 6 5, add three = 2 3 8 9 t e. 01 4567 : 1st hexachord P0/2nd hexachord I3 23 89te : 2nd hexachord P0/1st hexachord I3 complete chromatic scaleRetrograde-inversional combinatoriality is a lack of shared pitches between the hexachords of a row and its <b>retrograde-inversion.</b>|$|E
50|$|The work is Neoclassical in outlook, and his {{approach}} reflects Martin's adoration of Bach. Martin's style draws elements {{from both the}} musical styles and traditions of France (such {{as the use of}} harmony to create local colour and the freer formal organisation) and Austro-Germany (such as the generally polyphonic style and the dense motivicism). The work also demonstrates Martin's use of the 12-tone technique, though in an entirely different way from the composers of the Second Viennese School. A 12-note row is apparent {{at the opening of the}} first movement, though Martin treats it as he does any other thematic or motivic material: it appears in various transpositions (all twelve, if fragmentary statements are included) but is never used in inversion, retrograde or <b>retrograde-inversion</b> forms, and is by no means present throughout the work. The row also demonstrates some other characteristic features of the composer's 12-tone technique, including the use of constant rhythmic values, no octave transpositions within the series, and the row's use frequently as an accompanimental ostinato. Later in the movement however, Martin does demonstrate his own take on the technique, common in the music of Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern and others, of 'telescoping' his row forms, that is, the final note of one statement is also the first of the next at a different transposition, though unlike these composers, Martin only uses fragments of each row form.|$|E
40|$|Includes abstractDIRECTIONS expresses an {{interaction}} between a metric and a non-metric manipulation of rhythm, and {{an interaction}} between motivic and non-motivic manipulation of pitch. The parameter of pitch succession, however, is strictly controlled while the parameter of rhythmic succession is totally free. Limited motivic development occurs intermittently, while twelve tone procedures are utilized throughout the entire work. A restrictive use of tones 4, 8, 9, and 12 of the original row, and their respective counterparts in inversion, retrograde, and <b>retrograde-inversion,</b> limits the sounding of these tones to the lower strata of sound in any situation. The free, aleatoric moments are semi-controlled in that the pitches given are dictated by twelve tone proceedures. Two contrasting types of aleatoric rhythmic intensity, based on non-metric and metric notation, climax in the piece and are divided by an extended soloistic section which utilizes both types of rhythmic motion. An increasing volume of sustained sound accompanies both rhythmic climaxes. The piece follows the same shape dynamically {{as it does in}} rhythmic intensity. The form of the work is an asymmetrical ABA...|$|E
40|$|Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra is a twenty-two minute work {{cast in a}} {{traditional}} three movement concerto form. The basic harmonic/melodic materials are hexads and complementary hexads built on intervallic projections as propounded in Howard Hanson's Harmonic Materials of Modern Music. The opening movement is in double exposition form with a cadenza before the recapitulation. Marimba techniques used in the opening movement include chromatic thirty-second notes, mirrored octaves and single hand alternate sticking patterns. The form of the second movement is a rondo song form: a- b- a (inversion) - b (inversion) - c- c (retrograde) - b (<b>retrograde-inversion)</b> - a. The marimba plays rolled chords {{throughout much of the}} movement. The form of the third movement is a fast sonata-rondo form: a - b - a - development - b - a - coda. The development section of this final movement develops materials from both of the preceding movements and thus creates a cyclic form for the work. Marimba techniques explored in the third movement include dead strokes, octave dead strokes alternating with rolled octaves and, thirty-second note hexad patterns in fast alternation with the orchestra. This movement also contains sections in which the xylophone plays in duet with the marimba. Some of the compositional techniques used in the Concerto for Marimba and Orchestra include rhythmic modulation, augmentation, diminution, ostinato, inversion, retrograde, mirroring, odd meters, fragmentation, parallel motion, contrary motion, African rhythmic structure, harmonization with complementary sets and register sweeps...|$|E
40|$|Software {{development}} for both compositional systems and computer graphics has been extensive {{in the computer}} music field. Compositional systems employ different techniques in supporting the global strategies of composers, and they require alphanumeric input. Programs in computer graphics have been concerned primarily with the representation of common music notation. A System for Interactive Music Composition Through Computer Graphics was developed to provide a composer with an interactive, compositional, graphics environment. Musical constructs are not depicted in the system through common music notation, but through line-segment graphs. Since music is a temporal art, any musical parameter can be represented {{as a function of}} time. The process of visually/aurally perceiving structure is enhanced by using graphs instead of strings or tables of numbers as traditionally used in computer music. There are also no notational restrictions on frequency and rhythm like those encountered with common music notation. The system provides a way for the composer to organize the large amount of data needed in computer music composition. There are visual transformations in computer graphics which correlate to aural transformations in music. Algorithms for translation, scaling, and rotation support the musical transformations of transposition, augmentation, diminution, inversion, retrograde, and <b>retrograde-inversion.</b> The windowing algorithm is used throughout the system for inserting and extracting structures. This algorithm is also used in editing a portion of a structure in which that section is displayed on the graph for a finer level of detail. Structures can be created through entering points interactively, generating transformations of an existing structure, realizing a statistical distribution, or extracting a section from an existing structure. Editing possibilities include inserting or deleting points, lines, and curves, inserting one structure within another, or generating transformations of one structure within each line segment of another. These options help make the system both efficient and flexible. When the composer becomes familiar with the system, a large amount of data can be generated in a short time. It is a very powerful tool for organizing and manipulating musical constructs. The system can be used with relative ease by beginning as well as advanced composers. Thesis (D. A. ...|$|E
