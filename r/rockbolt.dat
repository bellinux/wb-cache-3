Much of the area was widened, tracks taken out, and a junction was created at 3900 level with three separate tunnels. One tunnel went to a massive repair facility '#7' and garage for servicing underground equipment. In 1979 #1 tunnel, which became the main tunnel, was collared and a new drift created at 4800 level to recover silver {{at the top of the}} mine. Heavy equipment including jumbos, various air or electric scoop trams in 2 to 8 yd configurations, <b>rockbolt</b> jumbos, giraffes, shotcrete machines, hyabs, mancarriers, dozers, graders, and jeeps were used.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University, 15 / 03 / 1999. In tunnel excavation, the use of rockbolts {{has long been a}} popular means of reinforcement in rock masses to prevent the rock opening from caving in. The idea has evolved from the earliest form of <b>rockbolt</b> made of wood to the more up-to-date form of pre-tensioned or grouted steel rockbolts. A major breakthrough in the design of <b>rockbolt</b> models was made by Aydan (1989). This <b>rockbolt</b> element was modelled in coupled form, with one sub-element representing the steel bolt, and the other sub-element the grout. This representation was necessary to model the complex action in the continuous rock mass near the joint. In elasticity problems, the large displacement formulation of a beam element is derived from the fundamental theory, and the bending phenomenon of a thin rod is analysed by the finite element discretizations of the bar elements and the beam elements. Experiments show that the deformation characteristics of the latter representation resemble a more realistic life behaviour. Based on this finding, this thesis proposes a modification to Aydan's two-dimensional <b>rockbolt</b> element, with the beam elements discretising the steel bolt. The different mechanical responses of a perfectly elastic <b>rockbolt</b> are considered, and the large displacement formulation of the new <b>rockbolt</b> element is derived by combining those of Aydan's <b>rockbolt</b> element and the beam element. The mechanics of the Aydan element and the new <b>rockbolt</b> element are described, and their performances are compared in an identical situation. It is found that in the two two-dimensional examples used in this thesis, the modified element ensures the continuity of curvature of the <b>rockbolt,</b> and in general, can act as support across a discontinuity or joint between rock masses well. In conjunction with the displacement method in the finite element procedures, a conventional iteration solution procedure is first described to solve the nonlinear incremental stiffness equation. However, it is found that this procedure is cumbersome, and requires a large amount of comptutations. Some limited storage quasi-Newton minimization algorithms are considered as an alternative...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, two new {{analytical}} {{approaches are}} presented {{on the basis}} of convergence-confinement method to compute both the ultimate convergence of circular tunnel and its plastic zone having been reinforced by systematically pre-tensioned fully grouted <b>rockbolts.</b> The models have two basic assumptions: (1) the grouted <b>rockbolts</b> increase the radial internal pressure within a broken rock mass by both the pre-tensioned force and the probable following induced force due to rock mass movement (2) tunnel convergence (specially short-term) occurs only due to reducing and diminishing of the radial constrained stress on tunnel surface provided by the working face. Hence, the values of both the pre-tensioned pressure and the mentioned radial constrained stress are specially taken into consideration in this paper. That is, according to their magnitudes, two different conditions occur: the magnitude of pre-tensioned pressure is greater than that of the constrained stress at bolt installation time and vice versa. The solutions are extended to each of conditions, and illustrative examples are solved.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{assessment}} of support {{systems such as}} <b>rockbolts</b> and rock anchors are {{very important for the}} maintenance of existing rock-engineering structures. The utilization of non-destructive tests is preferable to destructive tests such as pullout tests. The dynamic responses of rock anchors and <b>rockbolts</b> could be used for non-destructive tests.

In {{the first part of this}} study, some theoretical models are developed for the axial and trasverse dynamic tests and then results of numerical simulations are presented by considering possible conditions in-situ. These conditions are the bonding quality, the existence of corroded parts or couplers and pre-stress.

Moreover, the method effects three main improvements in the usual theory, taking into consideration: 1. the reaction force transferred to the rock mass in the bolts anchoring zone, 2. the elastic recompression of the carrying ring surrounding the excavation due to the bolts preload, and 3. the relative displacement of the bolts ends which has a repercussion on their tension. Since the usual rock-support interaction analysis is only available when the rock mass and the support behave independently, an alternative solution has been explored for the bolting system (since it cannot be considered as an internal support).

40|$|AbstractThis is {{a review}} {{paper on the}} {{performances}} of both conventional and energy-absorbing rockbolts manifested in laboratory tests. Characteristic parameters such as ultimate load, displacement and energy absorption are reported, in addition to load–displacement graphs for every type of <b>rockbolt.</b> Conventional rockbolts refer to mechanical rockbolts, fully-grouted rebars and frictional rockbolts. According to the test results, under static pull loading a mechanical <b>rockbolt</b> usually fails at the plate; a fully-grouted rebar bolt fails in the bolt shank at an ultimate load equal {{to the strength of}} the steel after a small amount of displacement; and a frictional <b>rockbolt</b> is subjected to large displacement at a low yield load. Under shear loading, all types of bolts fail in the shank. Energy-absorbing rockbolts are developed aiming to combat instability problems in burst-prone and squeezing rock conditions. They absorb deformation energy either through ploughing/slippage at predefined load levels or through stretching of the steel bolt. An energy-absorbing <b>rockbolt</b> can carry a high load and also accommodate significant rock displacement, and thus its energy-absorbing capacity is high. The test results show that the energy absorption of the energy-absorbing bolts is much larger than that of all conventional bolts. The dynamic load capacity is smaller than the static load capacity for the energy-absorbing bolts displacing based on ploughing/slippage while they are approximately the same for the D-Bolt that displaces based on steel stretching...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Most rock related {{fatalities}} {{and injuries}} in South African gold mines {{occur in the}} stope face area. These mines generally do not use rockbolts to support this area. This paper describes short <b>rockbolt</b> applications in the stope face area in a narrow tabular ultradeep Carbon Leader stope. The project began with the geotechnical definition of the generic Carbon Leader Reef hangingwall and {{the design of a}} short <b>rockbolt</b> support system to stabilise this hangingwall. In the paper the implementation efficiency of the bolting system is described. The quantification of ground conditions was undertaken by comparing bolted and unbolted portions of the stope face. This was done by using hangingwall profiling and stoping width measurements. Some numerical modelling is presented showing the benefits of bolting in the Carbon Leader Reef geotechnical area. The paper then briefly covers short bolt reinforcement design problems that still have to be overcome, such as quantifying and matching the bolt requirements of strength and yieldability and the reinforcement zone of influence of bolts, which is related to bolt spacing, in seismically active conditions.

40|$|<b>Rockbolting</b> {{telltales}} are now {{an internationally}} established means of providing preemptive warnings of roof falls. The dual height telltale, providing an immediate visible measurement distinguishing between movement {{above and below}} the <b>rockbolted</b> height, is the most widespread version. The dual height telltale was first developed by British Coal in the early 19902 ̆ 7 s as <b>rockbolting</b> was introduced to replace steel arch support and the success of this support system in deep coal mines has been widely ascribed to the use of this safety device. Since its adoption, many permutations and improvements on the basic design have been developed and applied worldwide to suit different mining circumstances; for instance, triple height telltales are commonly used where a combination of roofbolts and longer tendons are installed at the face of the heading. The choice of appropriate movement action levels is vital for safety. Experience has also shown that systematic management of the application of the telltale warning system is required to ensure that appropriate action (usually the installation of additional support) is taken in time when action levels are exceeded. In Australia, this is exemplified in the TARP approach. Another major development has been an intrinsically safe remote reading dual height telltale system which allows up to 100 electronic telltales to be connected with a twin core cable and read, using either a portable readout, {{from the end of the}} roadway, or a surface PC via a telephone cable connection. In the latter configuration, a real time display of roof condition is obtained whilst retaining the immediate visual indication underground. A recent development is the “Autowarning” telltale.

40|$|A large {{proportion}} of reinforcing elements in jointed rock mass can fail in shear. In the deep mines and rockburst-prone conditions, the bending and shear failure of rockbolts is also prevalent. This phenomenon has drawn greater attention and corresponding {{research has been conducted}} to investigate the shear performance of rockbolts. Nevertheless, the load transfer mechanism and the interaction between the rockbolts and rock mass were still not fully understood. Knowing both static and dynamic shear capacity of rockbolts and support systems is highly required to design the underground support rationally. The aim of this research is to provide a detailed analysis of shear behaviour of rockbolts using the laboratory tests and numerical modelling method approaches. <b>Rockbolt</b> and rock interaction, particularly near the shear joints, was investigated in this research. Four main parts were included in this thesis: static loading tests, numerical simulation under the static loading, dynamic loading tests, and numerical simulation under dynamic loading. A double shearing test (DST) system was used to examine the performance of <b>rockbolt</b> shearing. Testing was undertaken on certain strength concrete to simulate the rock mass. The laboratory test results reveal that rock strength, <b>rockbolt</b> diameters and installation angle, all affect the shear resistance of DST system by analysing the shear load-displacement relationships and the energy absorption abilities. It was found that rockbolts can increase the tension and shear properties of the surrounding rock mass. By comparing the DST results under static and dynamic loading conditions, {{it was found that the}} energy absorption ability of rockbolts is lower than under static loading condition. Thus, the dynamic performance of <b>rockbolt</b> is slight different with the static performance, which needs caution during the design of underground support in rockburst-prone condition. The numerical modelling technique was adopted to obtain the stress and strain developed along the bolt and surrounding materials under the shear load. FLAC 3 D was used for the static double shear tests, and ABAQUS Explicit was used for dynamic double shear tests. Parametric studies were investigated by the numerical simulation methods. This compensated the disadvantage of laboratory study, and could determine the commonly-used size of <b>rockbolt</b> performance that was not achieved in a laboratory study...|$|E

40|$|Rockbolts {{have become}} a popular {{technique}} for reinforcing rock mass {{all over the world}} as they are very effective and simple to install. Rockbolts are installed to reinforce fractured rock mass by resisting dilation and shear movement along the fractures. Several rockbolts can create a reinforced zone in fractured rock mass to improve the self-supporting capacity of rock. When the bolted rock mass deforms, load transfer occurs between the bolt and the rock. The grouted steel rebar is the most commonly used reinforcement system, using resins or cement grouts as an anchorage. Better understanding of the bolt load transfer mechanism leads to optimisation of the bolt profile design that can significantly improve the performance of the <b>rockbolt</b> reinforcement system. Historically, analytical models predicting the load distribution along the bolt subjected to tensile loading were proposed however, there were limitations in the available theories, requiring improvements. This thesis uses a combination of approaches involving laboratory tests, together with analytical and numerical models to propose new understanding of the <b>rockbolt</b> load transfer mechanism, aiming to optimise bolt design for ground support and improve rock mass reinforcement. In this thesis, laboratory push tests were conducted on 100 mm long <b>rockbolt</b> sections grouted in steel tubes with the objective of studying the factors influencing the load transfer capacity of rockbolts. Resin has a key role in activating the mechanical interlocking mechanism of bolt to resin or resin to borehole interface and hence, resin strength was studied. Two new analytical models are proposed here. The first analytical model of fully grouted rockbolts loaded in tension uses the non-linear bond-slip relationship describing the mechanical interaction at the bolt-grout interface. Derived equations of the loaddisplacement profile, shear stress distribution at the bolt-resin interface and axial load distribution in the bolt are given here. These equations were subsequently validated with experimental results from both the laboratory and in situ studies. The second analytical model considers the difference in behaviour between fully grouted bolts with and without the bolt free end slip when loaded in tension. This model validated by experimental data aims to predict the stress distribution of fully grouted bolts installed in weak strata where the bolt experiences free end slip. By taking the bolt free end slip into consideration, the shear and axial load distribution along the bolt can be accurately predicted. Numerical studies using the Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC) software were undertaken to further validate the bolt-grout bond-slip behaviour. A new approach of non-linear bond-slip relationship embedded into <b>rockbolt</b> elements was used to realistically model the bolt-resin load transfer and displacement profiles. This was achieved by writing the subroutine within FLAC using the programming language FISH. Fully grouted rockbolts subjected to tensile load with and without free end slip were modelled showing a close match with the experimental results in terms of loaddisplacement relationship, <b>rockbolt</b> axial force distribution and interfacial shear stress distribution. A mine roadway reinforced by fully grouted rockbolts was modelled using FLAC. Interaction between the rockbolts and the rock mass was studied using a numerical modelling approach with the <b>rockbolt</b> elements modified by the FISH subroutine. <b>Rockbolt</b> properties are characterised by the bond-slip relationship of the bolt-grout interface or grout-rock interface, which can be determined by pull or push tests of short <b>rockbolt</b> sections. Numerous 100 mm long bolt sections were push tested and the results implemented in the FLAC model. The interaction between rockbolts and rock mass subject to various stress state, rock mass quality and the presence of rock fractures or joints, was studied and the results are reported here.

40|$|Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) is {{a failure}} {{mechanism}} which has been observed to affect rockbolts installed {{in a number of}} Australian and overseas underground mines. SCC requires the application of a tensile stress on a material placed in an appropriately corrosive environment. SCC is characterised by the growth of fine fractures, originating from the surface of a material, which will continue to grow until they reach a critical length at which the material fails by mechanical overload. An extensive literature survey into <b>rockbolt</b> corrosion and SCC identified the need for a dedicated testing system for investigating SCC in full-scale <b>rockbolt</b> specimens. This thesis has focused on the design and development such a testing system. This system included a novel testing methodology, the Bending and Tension Loading Apparatus (BaTLA), which was housed within a Controlled Mine Environment (CME) laboratory, capable of recreating the atmospheric conditions present in an underground mine, as well as conduncting ‘accelerated’ tests using synthetic testing solutions. The development of this laboratory was based on the findings of a detailed field study conducted to characterise the geological, geotechnical, hydrological and atmospheric environment of two underground coal mines which have presented cases of <b>rockbolt</b> SCC. This newly developed laboratory was used to carry out an extensive testing program consisting of over 40, 000 hours worth of experimentation. This extensive testing program assessed the performance of both bending and tension loading in the BaTLA for investigating SCC in rockbolts. Both static and Slow Strain Rate (SSR) loading conditions were examined and each were found to be useful for investigating specific aspects of SCC. It was found that static testing provided the most appropriate means for examining mechanistic aspects of <b>rockbolt</b> SCC such as critical stress threshold, while SSR testing was found to be better suited to comparing material and environmental factors. A comparison of a number of steel grades and finishing treatments showed that lower strength 300 grade steel was far more resilient to SCC than both 1355 and HSAC 840 steel, and that surface treatments such as galvanising and grit blasting both provided notable improvements to a rockbolt’s SCC resilience. The testing program has also utilised small, representative coupon specimens. The coupon specimens used included the standard ASTM International G 39 bent beam specimen and a slotted split pin specimen. A comparison of <b>rockbolt</b> steel grades finishing treatments using slotted specimens revealed that 1355 grade steel is much more susceptible to SCC than HSAC 840 grade steel, and that galvanising provided a significant improvement in SCC resilience. The ASTM G 39 coupon specimens were used to examine critical stress thresholds for SCC and it was found that <b>rockbolt</b> steel may be susceptible to SCC at stresses as low as 580 MPa. Secondary testing carried out by calculating the plastic strain experienced by rockbolts at failure by examining their rib profile supported this observation of a low critical stress threshold, showing that a large proportion of in-situ rockbolts experienced SCC failure at, or slightly above their yield strength...|$|E
40|$|The {{displacements}} and stresses in {{layered rock}} above underground openings {{can be calculated}} using a beam model for the rock layers. The traditional approach assumes that interfaces between layers are frictionless and layers can slip past one another freely as they deflect. In contrast, the design of structural laminated beams has traditionally been {{based on the assumption}} that the interfaces between layers were welded, with no slip occurring there. In this work, the theory of composite laminated beams, which allows for partial slip on layer interfaces, is applied to the problem of predicting displacements and stresses in layered roof rock. The effects of <b>rockbolt</b> reinforcement are modeled by discrete shear and normal stiffnesses incorporated at locations in the model where the rockbolts cross layer interfaces. Published solutions and results for laminated composite beams are reviewed. Composite laminated beam theory provided a means of accounting for <b>rockbolt</b> reinforcement effects and provided a conceptual framework that was used to develop two FORTRAN programs; one, based on the force method of analysis, that automatically finds shear and tensile interface failures in the system, and the other a finite element program that employs beam elements, elastic interface elements, and <b>rockbolt</b> elements to model a rockbolted layered rock system. Published data together with results from these programs suggest that shear reinforcement may be more effective when placed near the ends of roof layers. The normal interaction between layers tends to be uniformly distributed unless <b>rockbolt</b> forces act on the layers or if partial delamination of layers has occurred. Both shear and normal reinforcement will cause stresses to be redistributed within the system of layers. Analysis of this redistribution of stresses requires that the sequence of interface failure be predicted which, in turn, requires that the properties of the individual layers, of the interfaces between layers, and of the rockbolts be properly taken into account. Laminated composite beam theory and programs based on this theory provide rational and efficient ways to study and analyze the behavior of layered roof rock...|$|E

The mechanism of the <b>rockbolt</b> in reinforcing a layered rock mass is then investigated through a four-layered rock beam example. The developed NMM is then used to investigate the rockfall instability caused by either natural joints or mining induced fractures in an underground power station house or a tunnel. The results illustrate that the developed NMM can not only capture the entire dynamic process of the rockfall but also locate the keyblock successfully. As such, corresponding reinforcement methods can be chosen reasonably. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Key Words：Dynamic loading; Pressure-released hole; Rockbolt; Numerical {{simulation}} Abstract. In {{order to}} study {{the effect on the}} structure of pressure-released hole combined support with <b>rockbolt</b> under dynamic loading, utilize RFPA 2 D-Dynamics on a numerical simulation of dynamic responses of roadway surrounding rock under different depths and different continued time of stress wave and different amplitudes of stress wave. It had gained the general law of the stress redistribution of roadway surrounding rock under static-dynamic coupling loading, and analysed the damage effect of static-dynamic coupling loading to surrounding rock from the perspective of acoustic emission energy release and failure units. Studies show that dynamic disturbance is the main inducing factor on instability of deep roadway supported by pressure-released hole combined support with <b>rockbolt,</b> the waveform of dynamic stress has important influence on broken surrounding rock, with the stress amplitude is the higher and the action time is longer, dynamic disturbance on stability of roadway bring about more significant effect would become...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe bolt-grout {{interface}} {{of fully}} grouted <b>rockbolts</b> {{has been studied}} {{with the aim of}} determining its constitutive law. For this purpose, axial loadings acting on the bar have been considered and theoretical and experimental research conducted. The theoretical investigations link the response of the surrounding materials (bolt, grout and ground) to that of the interface, which is not directly accessible. Pull-out tests have been carried out to obtain experimental information. Combining the theoretical developments with the test results, the interface variables can be determined. This procedure proves that, in order to study the bolt-grout interface accurately, the behaviour of the surrounding materials should be well known. From the available data, a semi-empirical formulation of the interface response is proposed. The tangential behaviour suggests that friction is not the only component to the shear stress. The normal response, which is more difficult to ascertain, depends on the bolt profile...|$|R
50|$|The New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM) was {{developed}} in the 1960s and is the best known of a number of engineering practices that use calculated and empirical measurements to provide safe support to the tunnel lining. The main idea of this method is to use the geological stress of the surrounding rock mass to stabilize the tunnel, by allowing a measured relaxation and stress reassignment into the surrounding rock to prevent full loads becoming imposed on the supports. Based on geotechnical measurements, an optimal cross section is computed. The excavation is protected by a layer of sprayed concrete, commonly referred to as shotcrete. Other support measures can include steel arches, <b>rockbolts</b> and mesh. Technological developments in sprayed concrete technology have resulted in steel and polypropylene fibres being added to the concrete mix to improve lining strength. This creates a natural load-bearing ring, which minimizes the rock's deformation.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the strong}} impacts or rockbursts in Ostrava-Karvina coalfield, which affect {{especially}} roadways and cross-cuts of longwall panels, {{it is necessary to}} strengthen standard steel roadways and breakthroughs supports. However it is a little different task in comparison with main solved problems of mining safety (Kidybinski, 2011), the use of reinforcing complementary bolts seems to be very effective. A varieties of numbers and locations of such <b>rockbolts</b> have been analyzed and compared from the viewpoint of the stability under dynamic events on the base of 3 D mathematic modeling. The method used for computer modeling has been FEM applied by ANSYS code. It deals with the shape and nature the following issues: the deformation of a steel support, strain and deformation of reinforcing bolts, the critical energy by which a permanent strain is caused and the influential interaction of the adjacent rock on the above mentioned characteristics. A recommendation for number and location of reinforcing complementary bolts is also contained. Web of Science 57120819...|$|R
