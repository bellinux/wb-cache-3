5|$|Philippe moved {{farther north}} {{skirting}} the low {{and continued to}} weaken gradually. The official forecast did not predict this, primarily as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> models indicating a reintensification to hurricane status. Philippe began to loop around {{the center of the}} non-tropical system, weakening as it did so. As Philippe turned towards Bermuda it weakened into a tropical depression on September 22. The depression degenerated into a remnant low the next day and this remnant continued to loop cyclonically and could be tracked for a further day or two within the circulation of the non-tropical system.|$|E

5|$|The {{landscape}} of Texas was changed as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> Spanish policies. As {{early as the}} 1690s, Spaniards brought European livestock, including cattle, horses, and mules, with them on their expeditions throughout the province. Some of the livestock strayed or stayed behind when the Spanish retreated from the territory in 1693, allowing the Indian tribes to begin loosely managing herds of the animals. These herds grazed heavily on the native grasses, allowing mesquite, which was native to the lower Texas coast, to spread inland. Although the introduced livestock were able {{to adapt to the}} changing conditions, the buffalo had a more difficult time grazing among the new vegetation, beginning the decline in their numbers. Spanish farmers also introduced tilling and irrigation to the land, further changing the landscape. Spanish architectural concepts were also adopted by those in Texas, including the addition of patios, tile floors and roofs, arched windows and doorways, carved wooden doors, and wrought iron grillwork.|$|E

25|$|The {{opinion that}} the Agathyrsi were almost {{certainly}} Thracians results also from the writings preserved by Stephen of Byzantium, who explains that the Greeks called the Trausi the Agathyrsi, {{and we know that}} the Trausi lived in the Rhodope Mountains. Certain details from their way of life, such as tattooing, also suggest that the Agathyrsi were Thracians. Their place was later taken by the Dacians. That the Dacians were of Thracian stock is not in doubt, and it is safe to assume that this new name also encompassed the Agathyrsi, and perhaps other neighboring Thracian people as well, as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> political upheaval.|$|E
25|$|According to Wild Bears of the Worlds, by Paul Ward and Suzanne Kynaston, {{human contact}} with bears has existed {{since the time}} of the Neanderthals and the European cave bear around 200,000 to 75,000 years ago. There is some {{evidence}} of cave bear worship during these early years: between the years 1917 and 1922, Emil Bachler discovered a large stone chest filled with cave bear skulls in the Drachenloch Cave, one of the Wildkirchli; between 1916 and 1922, Konrad Hormann found narrow niches filled with five cave bear skulls. However, at these sites, there have been little evidence of any human presence, and so some scientists have come to regard such discoveries as the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> natural cause.|$|E

For example, the boy rescues a child from an overturned carriage or finds and returns the man's stolen watch. Often the older man takes the boy into his home as a ward or companion and helps him find a better job, sometimes replacing a less honest or less industrious boy.|$|E

25|$|According to George Orwell, {{coal miners}} could develop {{characteristic}} tattoos owing to coal dust getting into wounds. This can also occur with substances like gunpowder. Similarly, a traumatic tattoo {{occurs when a}} substance such as asphalt is rubbed into a wound as the <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> kind of accident or trauma. These are particularly difficult to remove as {{they tend to be}} spread across several layers of skin, and scarring or permanent discoloration is almost unavoidable depending on the location. An amalgam tattoo is when amalgam particles are implanted in to the soft tissues of the mouth, usually the gums, during dental filling placement or removal; another example of such accidental tattoos {{is the result of a}} deliberate or accidental stabbing with a pencil or pen, leaving graphite or ink beneath the skin.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{sorts of}} light receptors in a birdâs eye, rods and cones. Rods, which contain the visual pigment {{rhodopsin}} are better for night vision {{because they are}} sensitive to small quantities of light. Cones detect specific colours (or wavelengths) of light, so they are more important to colour-orientated animals such as birds. Most birds are tetrachromatic, possessing four types of cone cells each with a distinctive maximal absorption peak. In some birds, the maximal absorption peak of the cone cell responsible for the shortest wavelength extends to the ultraviolet (UV) range, making them UV-sensitive. In addition to that, the cones at bird's retina are arranged in a characteristic form of spatial distribution, known as hyperuniform distribution, which maximizes its light and color absorption. This form of spatial distributions are only observed as a <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> optimization process, {{which in this case}} can be described in terms of bird's evolutionary history.|$|E
25|$|The severe floods of 2007 {{were the}} <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> 80 million cubic metres of {{rainfall}} falling on South Yorkshire on 25 June 2007. The {{level of the}} River Rother at Rotherham reached the highest level ever recorded, at , and the regulators were manned 24 {{hours a day in}} order to manage the water. However, there was a power failure at Canklow regulator, and the site had to be evacuated due to the threat posed by the possible breaching of the dam at Ulley Reservoir. The Meadowgate regulator was closed, and resulted in all four of the Rother Valley Country Park lakes flooding within the next 12 hours. Most of the car park and the watersports centre was also flooded, but water levels dropped over the next three days and little damage was caused. Assessment following those floods has led the Environment Agency to conclude that the regulators are expensive to maintain, and that they should be removed once some of the flood banks have been remodelled to ensure that the washlands fill and empty at the correct levels in a flood cycle.|$|E
