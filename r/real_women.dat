Some examples are the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, Canadian Civil Liberties Association, the Canadian Mental Health Association, the Canadian Labour Congress, the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), and <b>REAL</b> <b>Women</b> of Canada. The purpose of such interventions is to assist the court and to attempt to influence the court to render a decision favourable to the legal interests of the group.|$|E
25|$|There was an adage amongst Westerners {{that one}} could easily tell who was a real female and who was not – the transvestites were drop-dead gorgeous, while the rest were <b>real</b> <b>women.</b> The amount of revenue that the trans women of Bugis Street raked in was considerable, {{providing}} a booster {{shot in the arm}} for the tourism industry. The term 'Boogie Street' was always used by British servicemen and not, as some mistakenly believe, by Americans {{in the wake of the}} 1970s disco craze.|$|E

25|$|This {{features}} French poetry, then {{very influential}} in Italy. What distinguishes the Sicilian School from the troubadours, however, {{is the introduction}} of a kinder, gentler type of woman than that found in their French models; one who was nearer to Dante's madonnas and Petrarch's Laura, though much less characterised psychologically. The poems of the Sicilians hardly portray <b>real</b> <b>women</b> or situations (Frederick's song cannot be read as autobiographical), but the style and language are remarkable, since the Sicilians (as Dante called them) created the first Italian literary standard by enriching the existing vernacular base, probably inspired by popular love songs, with new words of Latin and Provençal origin.|$|E

"Wintour's {{approach}} hit a nerve—this {{was the way}} <b>real</b> <b>women</b> put clothes together (with {{the likely}} exception of wearing multi-thousand-dollar T-shirts)," [...] one reviewer says. On the June 1989 cover, another model was shown in wet hair, with just a bathrobe and no apparent makeup. Photographers, makeup artists, and hairstylists got credited along with the models. In August 2014, Gigi Hadid paid tribute to Wintour's first cover.|$|E

500|$|Chikafusa likely used Kamakura period Kokinshū commentaries such as {{the extant}} , which speculates that one of Komachi's poems was left for Narihira after a tryst. The Bishamondō-bon Kokinshū-chū in turn likely worked from a then-common belief that fictional Tales of Ise was a genuine {{historical}} work detailing the actual events in Narihira's life (see above). Kamakura period commentaries on The Tales of Ise therefore tried to insert the names of <b>real</b> <b>women</b> where the original text simply said [...] "a woman", and thus inserted Ono no Komachi into several passages of the text.|$|E
500|$|Baird's {{criticism}} of the stance of several African countries on same-sex rights and of the Russian Federation for its ban on [...] "homosexual propaganda" [...] and other moves to suppress LGBT rights have been condemned by the social conservative lobby group <b>REAL</b> <b>Women</b> of Canada which issued a statement accusing him of [...] "abuse of office" [...] claiming that [...] "Mr. Baird's actions are destructive to the conservative base in Canada and causing collateral damage to his party."

The Jakarta Post also calls her a [...] "deft satirist". She does not consider herself a feminist, as her songs are written about <b>real</b> <b>women</b> and not about female empowerment; she has said that her lyrics are not of the [...] "'hear me roar' type".|$|E

500|$|The male leads Horner and Harcourt {{were played}} by the contrasted actors Charles Hart and Edward Kynaston (or Kenaston). The forcefully {{masculine}} 45-year-old Hart [...] "was celebrated for superman roles, notably the arrogant, bloodthirsty Almanzor in John Dryden's Conquest of Granada", and also for playing rakish comedy heroes with nonchalance and charisma. Many critics credit the personalities and skills of Hart and Nell Gwyn with creating, {{as much as any}} playwright did, the famous flirting/bantering Restoration comedy couple. The beautiful androgynous Kynaston, probably in his early thirties, was a different kind of hero. He had started his career in 1660 as the outstanding Restoration female impersonator [...] "the prettiest woman in the whole house" [...] before <b>real</b> <b>women</b> entered the profession in the fall of 1660. (The 2004 movie Stage Beauty is loosely based on Kynaston's career.) ...|$|E
500|$|A Restoration {{novelty of}} which Wycherley took {{advantage}} was {{the readiness of}} public opinion to accept women on stage, {{for the first time}} in British history. Audiences were fascinated to see <b>real</b> <b>women</b> reverse the cross-dressing of the Elizabethan boy actors and appear in tight-fitting male outfits in the popular breeches roles, and to hear them match or even outdo the rake heroes in repartee and double entendre. Charles' choice of actresses as mistresses, notably Nell Gwyn, helped keep the interest fresh, and Wycherley plays on this interest in The Country Wife by having Mr. Pinchwife disguise his wife (the eponymous 'country wife') in a boy's outfit. It has also been suggested that he uses the allure of women on display to emphasise in an almost voyeuristic way Margery's provocative innocence, as well as the immodest knowingness of [...] "town" [...] wives like Lady Fidget.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, {{in recent}} times Cosby's {{controversial}} history with women has caused some contemporary critics to question his intentions behind creating a character like Clair {{in the wake of}} a series of sexual assault allegations made against the comedian. In 2014, The Crunk Feminist Collective famously published an article entitled [...] "Clair Huxtable is Dead: On Slaying the Cosbys" [...] in which the author dismissed the character's progressive gender politics as [...] "a sham", arguing that Clair must forgotten to allow for a new generation of television heroines. Nico Lang of The Daily Dot defended the character against such critics, writing that the show's legacy remains significant [...] "to the Clair Huxtables of the world, both the <b>real</b> <b>women</b> she inspired and a generation of characters who owe a debt to her." [...] Writing for Paste, in 2014 Shannon M. Houston maintains that Clair remains beloved as a [...] "feminist hero" [...] by the same people who now try to disassociate themselves from both Cosby and The Cosby Show. Kirthana Ramisetti of the New York Daily News agreed that Cosby [...] "can’t detract from Clair’s enduring legacy." [...] John Teti, contributing to The A. V. Club, agreed that [...] "Clair Huxtable’s legacy remains intact" [...] despite [...] "the snowballing disgrace of its star has made The Cosby Show less of a wholesome memory than it once was".|$|E

500|$|Hoping {{to divert}} {{herself from the}} grief of Cazale's death, Streep {{accepted}} a role in The Seduction of Joe Tynan (1979) as the chirpy love interest of Alan Alda, later commenting that she played it on [...] "automatic pilot". She performed the role of Katherine in The Taming of the Shrew for Shakespeare in the Park, and also played a supporting role in Manhattan (1979) for Woody Allen. Streep later said that Allen did not provide her with a complete script, giving her only the six pages of her own scenes, and did not permit her to improvise a word of her dialogue. In the drama Kramer vs. Kramer, Streep was cast opposite Dustin Hoffman as an unhappily married woman who abandons her husband and child. Streep thought that the script portrayed the female character as [...] "too evil" [...] and insisted {{that it was not}} representative of <b>real</b> <b>women</b> who faced marriage breakdown and child custody battles. The makers agreed with her, and the script was revised. In preparing for the part, Streep spoke to her own mother about her life as a wife with a career, and frequented the Upper East Side neighborhood in which the film was set, watching the interactions between parents and children. The director Robert Benton allowed Streep to write her own dialogue in two key scenes, despite some objection from Hoffman, who [...] "hated her guts". Jaffee and Hoffman later spoke of Streep's tirelessness, with Hoffman commenting, [...] "She's extraordinarily hardworking, to the extent that she's obsessive. I think that she thinks about nothing else but what she's doing." [...] The film was controversial among feminists, but it was a role which film critic Stephen Farber believed displayed Streep's [...] "own emotional intensity", writing that {{she was one of the}} [...] "rare performers who can imbue the most routine moments with a hint of mystery".|$|E

2500|$|Wolf {{suggested}} in 2003 that {{the ubiquity of}} internet pornography tends to enervate the sexual attraction of men toward typical <b>real</b> <b>women.</b> She writes, [...] "The onslaught of porn is responsible for deadening male libido in relation to <b>real</b> <b>women,</b> and leading men to see fewer and fewer women as 'porn-worthy.' Far from having to fend off porn-crazed young men, young women are worrying that as mere flesh and blood, they can scarcely get, let alone hold, their attention." [...] Wolf advocates abstaining from porn not on moral grounds, but because [...] "greater supply of the stimulant equals diminished capacity." ...|$|E
