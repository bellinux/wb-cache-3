40|$|BACKGROUND: In medical practice, {{clinically}} unexpected measurements {{might be}} quite properly {{handled by the}} <b>remeasurement,</b> removal, or reclassification of patients. If these habits are not prevented during clinical research, how much of each is needed to sway an entire study? METHODS AND RESULTS: Believing {{there is a difference}} between groups, a well-intentioned clinician researcher addresses unexpected values. We tested how much removal, <b>remeasurement,</b> or reclassification of patients would be needed in most cases to turn an otherwise-neutral study positive. <b>Remeasurement</b> of 19 patients out of 200 per group was required to make most studies positive. Removal was more powerful: just 9 out of 200 was enough. Reclassification was most powerful, with 5 out of 200 enough. The larger the study, the smaller the proportion of patients needing to be manipulated to make the study positive: the percentages needed to be remeasured, removed, or reclassified fell from 45 %, 20 %, and 10 % respectively for a 20 patient-per-group study, to 4 %, 2 %, and 1 % for an 800 patient-per-group study. Dot-plots, but not bar-charts, make the perhaps-inadvertent manipulations visible. Detection is possible using statistical methods such as the Tadpole test. CONCLUSIONS: Behaviours necessary for clinical practice are destructive to clinical research. Even small amounts of selective <b>remeasurement,</b> removal, or reclassification can produce false positive results. Size matters: larger studies are proportionately more vulnerable. If observational studies permit selective unblinded enrolment, malleable classification, or selective <b>remeasurement,</b> then results are not credible.

MethodsComplete medical record (hospital chart) review for indications, care processes, and outcomes was performed on a random sample of Medicare patients undergoing CEA in 10 states (Arkansas, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Nebraska, Ohio, Oklahoma) during baseline (Jun 1, 1995 to May 31, 1996) and <b>remeasurement</b> (Jun 1, 1998 to May 31, 1999) periods. In addition to review of the index hospital stay, hospital admissions within 30 days of the procedure were reviewed and the Medicare enrollment database queried to identify out-of-hospital deaths, to determine 30 -day outcome results. The baseline data by state were provided to the Medicare Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs) in the respective states, and quality improvement initiatives were encouraged. ResultsWe reviewed 9945 primary CEA alone procedures, 236 CEA and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) procedures, and 380 repeat CEA operations during the baseline period (B), and 9745 primary CEA alone procedures, 233 CEA and CABG procedures, and 401 repeat CEA operations during the <b>remeasurement</b> period (R). There was a significant decrease in the combined event rate (30 -day stroke or mortality) for CEA alone procedures between baseline and <b>remeasurement</b> (B, 5. 6 %; R, 5. 0 %). A decrease occurred in each of the indication strata; transient ischemic attack or stroke (B, 7. 7 %; R, 6. 9 %), nonspecific symptoms (B, 5. 9 %; R, 5. 4 %), and no symptoms (B, 4. 1 %; R, 3. 8 %). The combined event rate also decreased for CEA and CABG (B, 17. 4 %; R, 13. 3 %) and repeat CEA operations (B, 6. 8 %; R, 5. 7 %). The <b>remeasurement</b> period state-to-state variation in combined event rate for CEA alone ranged from 2. 7 % (Georgia) to 5. 9 % (Indiana) for all indications combined, from 4. 4 % (Georgia) to 10. 9 % (Michigan) in patients with recent transient ischemia or stroke, from 1. 4 % (Georgia) to 6. 0 % (Oklahoma) in patients with no symptoms, and from 3. 7 % (Georgia) to 7. 9 % (Indiana) in patients with nonspecific symptoms. There were significant increases in preoperative antiplatelet administration (62 %- 67 %; P <. 0001) and patching (29 %- 45 %; P =. 05) from baseline to <b>remeasurement</b> in the CEA alone subset. Preoperative antiplatelet administration and patching were associated with improved outcomes in the combined baseline and <b>remeasurement</b> data. ConclusionsCommunity-wide quality improvement initiatives with performance measurement and confidential reporting of provider level data can lead to improvement in important care processes and outcomes. There is considerable variation between states in outcome and process, and thus continued room for improvement. Quality improvement projects that include standardized confidential outcome reporting should be encouraged.
