5|$|Following {{the loss}} of {{territory}} required for the peace treaty, the embittered aristocracy started forming independent states within the Sasanian Empire.

5|$|For the Persians, the two {{expeditions to}} Greece {{had been largely}} successful; new territories had been added to their empire and Eretria had been punished.

Yet, for the Greeks, it was an enormously significant victory. It {{was the first time}} that Greeks had beaten the Persians, and showed them that the Persians were not invincible, and that resistance, rather than subjugation, was possible.|$|E

5|$|In late 1401, the new {{war against}} the Order {{overstretched}} the <b>resources</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanians, who found themselves fighting on two fronts after uprisings in the eastern provinces.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the setbacks at the Defile, Marj Ardabil and other similar disasters, the need to reinforce the buckling frontiers stretched the military and financial <b>resources</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Caliphate. This was especially the case with the powerful Syrian army, the main pillar of the Umayyad regime, which was parcelled out to reinforce distant provinces. Eventually, this weakening of the Syrian army would be the major factor in the fall of the Umayyad dynasty during the civil wars of the 740s and the Abbasid Revolution that followed them.|$|E
