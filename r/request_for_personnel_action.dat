Accordingly, the Technical Subcommittee directed that Oliphant and six assistants would go to Berkeley, and later move on to Los Alamos. Oliphant found that he and Lawrence had quite different designs, and that the American one was frozen, but Lawrence, who had expressed a desire for Oliphant to join him on the electromagnetic project as early as 1942, was eager for Oliphant's assistance. Oliphant secured the services of a fellow Australian physicist, Harrie Massey, who had been working for the Admiralty on magnetic mines, along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke, who had worked with him on the cavity magnetron. This initial group set out for Berkeley in a B-24 Liberator bomber in November 1943. Oliphant found that Berkeley had shortages of key skills, particularly physicists, chemists and engineers. He prevailed on Sir David Rivett, the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research in Australia, to release Eric Burhop to work on the project. His <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>personnel</b> were met, and the British mission at Berkeley grew in number to 35, two of whom, Robin Williams and George Page, were New Zealanders.|$|R
40|$|Downsizing is {{sometimes}} necessary, {{but it always}} can be done better or worse. This essay reviews evidence about some of what to avoid, as well as about what to approach, in such dour (if not tragic) exercises. Whatever that case, downsizing also always involves normative or value issues, both in the choice between alternative vehicles <b>for</b> adverse <b>personnel</b> <b>actions</b> {{as well as in}} the global question: Why downsize? As a sampler, three points illustrate what is best avoided in downsizing experiences. Thus, they should strive hard to “let in the sunshine, " but commonly trend toward secretive cabals at the highest levels. Moreover, cutback commonly is used as an all-purpose tool, with major costs. Relatedly, downsizing often penalizes the relatively blameless, which implies both value and ethical shortfalls. What downsizing should emphasize gets illustrated by five exemplars. Thus, buy-in should be sought, early and late, and especially at operating levels; the range of adverse <b>personnel</b> <b>actions</b> should be enlarged; appropriate problems should be targeted, but downsizing often sets in motion counterproductive dynamics; useful infrastructures should be built, but seldom are; and downsizing hosts should be oriented toward learning from the past, in principle and especially in practice...|$|R
