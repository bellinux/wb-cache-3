Ford was injured for several games in November and December and the Spaniard stepped in with impressive performances. In three {{games against the}} Memphis Grizzlies, Cleveland Cavaliers and Chicago Bulls, Calderón provided 37 assists while committing only three turnovers. 14 games into the season, he was also leading the league in assist-to-turnover ratio with 5.67 to 1, but even so, he said: [...] "But how I feel about the team <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we need T.J.

He shot at least 50% on field goals, 40% on three-pointers, and 90% on free-throws, and is sometimes listed {{as a member of}} the NBA's 50–40–90 Club, even though he was sixteen free-throws shy of attaining the [...] number of makes in this category. By mid-season, he was touted as a possibility for making the All-Star reserve team. Even after Ford returned from injury for the final third of the campaign, Calderón was able to keep his place in the starting lineup. Ford had initially agreed to playing backup, but reportedly became frustrated at not being able to start. Calderón eventually asked the coaching staff to play Ford as starter instead, leading to widespread praise from the coaching staff, teammates, and fans. Given that he was going to become a free agent by the end of the campaign, there were even calls for Ford to be traded so that the team could be built around Calderón as point guard. By the end of the regular season, Calderón was fifth in the league for assists per game, and in the 2008 NBA Playoffs, Ford split the playing time with him about equally, with the two players combining for averages of 23.4 points and 13.6 assists per game. However, the Raptors were eliminated by the Orlando Magic in the first round four games to one.|$|E

40|$|This {{piece is}} an {{exercise}} I consider a failure, but, as such, a meaningful artifact. On the one hand, I have been becoming increasingly frustrated by writing; on the other, I {{have been trying to}} resolve a piece whose first iteration took form in late July this year. There were a few different key components, including a sculptural/architectural structure, reminiscent of a temporary shelter, intended for one body; and the core of this work was a performance, which took place without much preemptive announcement and similarly remained not excessively documented. I was interested in the seemingly ephemeral formal nature of the work and yet the potential, due to its content, to be quite the opposite and to linger and even fester. The performance component of this piece was my setting a timer and speaking without any preparation at all for 1 hour 20 minutes about trauma. The specific topic isn’t so important, although I enjoy something like the lyricism that the ostensible content densifies the ideas of articulation, especially spontaneous articulation and all the otherwise hidden tics and convulsions that become manifest in extemporaneity. I am still processing that experience and still very much in the midst of trying to resolve this piece. One of the important components of this aforementioned piece is its unrepeatability; this seems to best fit the formal logic that the work suggests for itself. A hurdle, then, in pursuing further investigation. Hence the idea to try a variation of it in which I improvise sensory deprivation as well as disorientation and talk, again without preparation, this time about the space of a studio and trying to transfer that space in some way to another place. To furthermore remove the locus or formal/physical center of the work, there was no separate architecture and instead the whole of my studio became the “temporary shelter” and the voice became material in lieu of wood, plastic, metal etc. And the tangibility of this voice becomes manifest in the transcription. So the exercise was to test the wager that while the manifest material components of the work changed, that the content would remain. That the content, as I said, wasn’t the ostensible content (trauma) but something else, something I have thus far found unnameable. But if forced, then I would say it is something like articulation and testing the threshold of articulability. Why this exercise fails, at least for me <b>right</b> <b>now,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the materiality and physicality, which get necessarily lost through the transcription, appear more than ever to be in fact quite essential to the piece. Perhaps failure is a misnomer. It is rather that this other form rather than evolving the piece seems to rather just render another kind of work. And in that, it perhaps does what I wanted it to: to transport to another space, while playing with the ideas of transport and of space. Though I am still not convinced that text is the way that is most native to the work I’m after, it is nevertheless making me begin to think anew about so many complications endemic to performance/action, about the complexities between score and execution, about trying to master or manipulate time, about trying to subvert known architectures...|$|E
40|$|It 2 ̆ 7 s time {{to reconsider}} {{retirement}} incomes, write ANITRA NELSON and FRANS TIMMERMAN “SUPER” has performed decidedly “sub” in recent times, {{raising questions about}} the limits of compulsory worker superannuation as one, crumbling, pillar of our retirement income policy. The other two pillars are voluntary private saving and the traditional means-tested government-funded age pension. During 2008, the assets of superannuation funds reporting to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority fell by 14. 8 per cent, from over 1. 2 trillion to 1. 05 trillion. As a result, most people’s financial assets locked in superannuation were devalued. For those depending on superannuation benefits as income to live off, returns diminished by about 18 per cent on average for the year ending 30 January 2009. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in 2007 only one in every sixteen people had any defined benefits, the kind unaffected by market downturns. Meanwhile income from contributions kept rolling in - amounting to over 19 billion {{in the last quarter}} of 2008. Indeed a recent Deloitte study forecasts that superannuation will amount to 2 trillion over the next five years. This money is invested in Australia and offshore in a range of unhedged and hedged shares and investments, as well as unlisted and listed property, and “cash”. As such, varying portions of it are directly subject to fluctuations in exchange rates and all to the vicissitudes of the global financial market. Super’s Australian history Gough Whitlam first placed universal superannuation coverage on the national agenda in 1973. A decade later Bob Hawke picked up the baton and, by 1993, eight in every ten workers were contributing to the superannuation system. Since then no year has gone by without some major reform or adjustment to what has become compulsory for most employees and their employers. The government has complemented regulation with incentives for saving via superannuation funds to pay for one’s retirement. The policy rationale is that the compulsory scheme means that superannuants can have a comfortable retirement without draining the public purse. Some even believe that superannuation will replace government pensions some time in the future. Yet Treasury expects the proportion of seniors on pensions to remain constant at around 2007 levels until 2047, even though greater numbers of them are expected to receive only part benefits. In 2007, less than half of the 65 - 69 year age group was covered by superannuation. In mid- 1991, 67 per cent of retirees received full age pension benefits, falling to 56 per cent in mid- 2008. In the same period the trend for those receiving partial benefits rose from 49 per cent to 64 per cent. But the current crisis has seen more seniors applying for the age pension - the number rose 50 per cent between the third and fourth quarters of 2008. The government has not gone as far as designating a proportion of social security benefits as superannuation contributions, a necessary step in it becoming the primary pillar of a national retirement welfare policy. In 2007, one in three Australians over the age of 15 years did not actually contribute to or benefit from superannuation. This figure includes the self-employed, who are not obliged to contribute. There are great disparities in superannuation cover, especially among those approaching retirement in the next decade or two. The average superannuation balance for the 55 to 64 year old group is 165, 000 but one in two have a balance of less than 24, 000 - and the rest much higher balances. The inequities sharply divide male and female retirees: women are not only less likely to be covered by superannuation but, when they are, they tend to have lower balances. The singular failing of privatising the responsibility for retired workers’ needs is that it relies totally on the cycles of the capitalist system. Any brutal correction, such as the one we are experiencing now, will seriously affect those relying, even partly, on such benefits. Clearly, people retiring in some time periods are likely to be unfairly hit, making retirement decision-making difficult. So, if you embarked on retirement in 2006, say, just when you thought that you might have earned some distance from the vagaries of the labour market, retrenchments and unemployment, it’s “Here I go again. ” Indeed busts are times when people of retirement age might well be forced by the circumstances of the labour market to rely on their superannuation nest egg. Pension plus The fundamental reliance of superannuation on the boom and bust of financial markets makes a modest, reliable pension look like a better option. What about having everyone just pay more taxes throughout their income-earning years to keep the current cohort of retired citizens alive and kicking? The pension rate could be improved, making anyone without a reasonable level of independent means eligible - a simple, fair and dependable alternative. Another option would be to make superannuation funds more directly government-regulated and make them channel the major proportion of their investments into the relatively sound and safe area of home-lending. This policy option could have wide benefits - improving intergenerational equity by providing a balanced win-win result for superannuants and homeowners with a mortgage. Power over the ways superannuation contributions were directed while waiting for the beneficiaries to draw them down could enable government provision of other loans with socio-environmental benefits on an ad hoc or permanent basis. The obvious example here and now is low and/or fixed interest rates on short-to-medium term loans for making green improvements to existing homes or similarly to enhance a newly built dwelling. Has it worked? The staple line <b>right</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> superannuation is an excellent way to invest in the long term. But to say, “Don’t look now, come back and see in ten years time!” is hardly appropriate advice to people already retired or facing retirement right now. Superannuants feeling the pinch have been advised to budget, seek financial advice, think about re-entering the workforce and investigate making up for lost income by going onto some level of the aged pension. In other words there are hundreds of thousands of retirees throughout the country each individually making arduous decisions about how to get by. Meanwhile the super funds have not been running a tight ship. An Australia Institute paper (PDF), published in November 2008, argued that the 2005 Choice of Fund Policy had proved ineffective, given that only one in ten people who can now choose their super fund had switched (and many of them had been forced) and the subsequent expansion of multiple accounts. The paper argued further that the complexity made most people opt for default options and that the government should tighten regulations and cap fees. In mid- 2008 the Minister for Superannuation was forced to announce a review of the worryingly high fees and charges of the funds - an average of 1. 25 per cent per annum (or one per cent of GDP). Rainmaker Research had found that financial advisers alone had received 2. 4 billion in fees and commissions from the funds during 2007 as the share market tumbled. Yet the minister flagged that the government’s response to market inefficiencies - to support ways of making the system more competitive - already seemed a more likely recommendation than regulation. There are no signs that the government will contemplate radical reform now. Yet, this is the very best time to rethink the rationale of privatising the responsibility for seniors rather than implement a simple, reliable and adequate age pension plan for all those who do not have another form of income. • Anitra Nelson is a senior research associate with RMIT University, currently working with colleagues on a study of mortgage default in Australia funded by the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute.

40|$|Two {{headline}} stories dominate {{discussion of}} China's energy trajectory <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> The first <b>is</b> <b>that</b> reports from three agencies all {{point to the}} continuing decline in use of coal {{in the first half}} of 2015, continuing a trajectory already notable in 2014. These are not declines in the rate of growth, but absolute declines in the amount of coal consumed in power generation as well as in energy-intensive industries like steel and cement production. This points to the possibility that coal consumption may be peaking much earlier than anticipated in official government statements – and so pointing to an early peaking of carbon emissions. If continued, this would be a 'Great Reversal' of China's recent dominant role in consumption of dirty fossil fuels and production of greenhouse gases...|$|R
