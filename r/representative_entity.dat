In order to select event-related sentences, I designed a two-stage method to extract <b>representative</b> <b>entity</b> terms in the event-related discussions and filter {{out most of the}} sentences semantically un-related to thequery event. A rule-based method was applied to extract sentences describing sub-events. After that, the discussions are assigned to the corresponding sub-events according to the semantic relatedness measure. Finally, according to the occurring time of each sub-event, the timeline summarization is organized. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated based on real-world datasets. The experiment results showed that each processing step performs effectively. Especially, most noise sentences could be filtered by the proposed method. Moreover, the final timeline summarization graded by users is proven to be usefulto well understand the discussion trend of a sub-event...|$|E

Organizations and universities can collaborate {{for the development of}} such solutions, mainly through the creation and adoption of social innovations. Social innovation is no new phenomenon, and its concept covers {{the construction of a new}} way to meet social demands. This way, in Brazil, since 2005 FINEP has included social innovation in the FINEP Award for technological innovation. The Social Entrepreneurship Service (SESI), an industry <b>representative</b> <b>entity</b> in the country, perceiving the need to form qualified professionals for the conception and implementation of social projects, has developed an announcement named “Diretrizes de Incentivo do Departamento Nacional para os Programas Estratégicos do SESI – 2005 Educação, Lazer e Saúde (Incentive Guidelines from the National Department for SESI Strategic Programs – 2005 Education, Leisure and Health). ” SESI in the state of Paraná (PR), after a broad analysis, established a focus on Social Entrepreneurship.

40|$|The {{decade of}} the sixties {{witnessed}} a resurgence of radical or leftist movements in the United States as manifested in the political activism of college students, civil rights organizations, community groups and others. Today, in the post-Vietnam era of the seventies, the fires of the New Left {{appear to have been}} dampened. But even though these groups may be less visible and vocal today, {{it would be a mistake}} to think that their ideas are no longer of interest to certain segments of our society. Some contemporary New Left groups, while outwardly rejecting dramatic Marxist revolutionary tactics have instead engaged in grass-roots organizing efforts at the community level. What follows is an analysis of one such New Left organization, Western Massachusetts Labor Action (WMLA), an affiliate of the National Labor Federation (NATLFED). Prior literature regarding NATLFED and its branch associations (2 ̆ 2 entities 2 ̆ 2) has been descriptive of the organization, but heavily propagandistic (National Labor Federation, 1976; Leggett and Mouldner, 1976). Here, we attempt a critical examination of WMLA both as a <b>representative</b> <b>entity</b> of NATLFED and as an example of an independent effort to organize the poor. The essential question addressed is the manner in which grass-roots, community-based groups can best organize the poor to improve their living conditions in American society...|$|E
40|$|Availability is {{a feature}} of information. Availability is {{frequently}} connected to information security. So it is now. But in this thesis, the viewpoint is slightly different form the usually understood context of information security. Here, availability is dealt with as a compulsory feature of the information, which is essential to make as optimal decisions as possible for making the future. Security is understood as a state, which will be reached by using information that is available. The approach to security in this thesis is broadly understood as "making security with available information". The overall frame of this thesis is based on European philosophy represented by Henri Bergson, Martin Heidegger, Karl Popper, Hans-Georg Gadamer and Jurgen Habermas. The philosophical approach is chosen {{to be able to}} deal with the rather broad and abstract wholeness of the overall problem. The philosophical approach is something new for the researcher, as well, thus offering new challenges and an opportunity to learn something new and broaden the worldview. The philosophical background is supplemented with theories about time, information and knowledge management and problem solving to reach more practical solutions. Finally, a <b>representative</b> <b>entity</b> of the information availability environment is analysed to validate the philosophical-theoretical construction. The hypothesis of this thesis is formulated around the theories of time, information and problem solving concluded with the description of social systems conducted in the theory of communicative act by Jurgen Habermas. Research questions will deal with the combination of time and information to reach understanding to construct a model, which is used to solve information availability issues in temporally demanding decision-making environment. This thesis is hermeneutical, reaching towards understanding those phenomena that concern information availability. Features of availability that are dealt with are connected to information itself and the purpose of using information, the refining process of information in a purposeful action, and time from few viewpoints. All this is connected in a context of a social system. On the basis of all this, a suitably abstracted model is constructed to understand how information can be used and what kind of aspects availability contains. On the basis of that, a complex entity of information availability in a temporally demanding decision-making environment is analysed. This entity contains the temporal and meaningful divergence of information. This system is solved on the basis of the theoretical frame. A new kind of solution to model the use of available information in a temporally demanding decision-making environment is constructed. Finally a number of new research questions will emerge, which is well suited to the science philosophical frame that is selected to be obeyed in this thesis. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo geral desta dissertaÃÃo de mestrado Ã {{discutir}} a crise do sindicalismo contemporÃneo, tendo como foco empÃrico as relaÃÃes entre professores da rede estadual do CearÃ e sua entidade representativa, o sindicato APEOC, abarcando o perÃodo que vai da greve de 2011 atÃ o presente. Essa discussÃo buscarÃ elucidar as consequÃncias daquela greve na relaÃÃo entre base e sindicalistas, visto que aquele movimento foi encerrado deixando tensÃes entre os sujeitos relacionados. Para a realizaÃÃo desta pesquisa, o campo empÃrico eleito se compÃe dos ambientes de interaÃÃo da base com o sindicato, tais como: manifestaÃÃes pÃblicas, assembleias gerais e outros. AlÃm disso, foi realizado levantamento de dados em duas escolas da rede estadual do CearÃ: uma na capital, Fortaleza, e outra no interior. O objetivo disso Ã buscar apreender as visÃes desses sujeitos sobre a atuaÃÃo do seu sindicato no perÃodo analisado. A pesquisa de campo na escola da capital ocorreu entre fevereiro e maio de 2014. JÃ na escola do interior, a investigaÃÃo ocorreu entre julho e dezembro do mesmo ano. O texto da dissertaÃÃo apresenta a narrativa da greve, a partir do recurso metodolÃgico dos dramas sociais, seguindo as formulaÃÃes de Victor Turner, a anÃlise dos elementos de tensÃo e conflito entre as partes, durante e apÃs o movimento grevista e as posturas dos professores entrevistados das duas escolas escolhidas como campo empÃrico. Alguns resultados encontrados foram: que a greve de 2011 gerou conflitos entre direÃÃo sindical e base, que se mantÃm atÃ os dias atuais; que esses revelam processos de oligarquizaÃÃo, burocratizaÃÃo e relativa estatizaÃÃo do sindicato APEOC, que fomentam sua crise de representatividade, desmobilizando a base. Ademais, os docentes percebem em sua profissÃo o que GraÃa Druck denomina de desmantelamento, o que foi confirmado pela anÃlise de leis relacionadas Ã atividade, alÃm da forma como o Plano de Cargos, Carreiras e SalÃrios foi estruturado apÃs 2011. A dissertaÃÃo conclui que o desmantelamento se apresenta como uma forma de fragmentaÃÃo da categoria ao pulverizar as demandas dos professores, o que Ã potencializado pela sua fragmentaÃÃo interna, isto Ã, pelos conflitos internos Ã categoria relacionados Ã forma como a greve de 2011 foi encerrada. This Masterâs dissertation general goal is {{to discuss}} the contemporary labor union crisis, having as empirical focus the relationship between teachers {{from the state of}} CearÃ and their <b>representative</b> <b>entity,</b> the APEOC union, covering the period from the 2011 strike until now. This discussion will seek to elucidate the consequences of that strike on the relationship between the grass roots and the union leaders, given that that movement was ended leaving tensions between the related subjects. To carry out this research, the chosen empirical field consists of the interactions environments between the grass roots and the union leaders, just as: demonstrations, general assemblies and others. Moreover, data was collected in two schools from the state of CearÃ: one in the capital, Fortaleza, and another in the interior. The {{goal is to}} understand these subjectsâ visions on the role of their labor union in the analyzed period. The field research in the school of the capital occurred between February and May of 2014. In the interior one, the investigation occurred between July and December of the same year. The dissertation text presents the narrative of the strike, from social dramas methodological resources, following Victor Turnerâs formulations, the analysis of elements of tension and conflicts between the parts during and after the strike movement and the position of interviewed teachers from the two schools chosen as empirical field. Some of the results founded out were: the 2011 strike has generated conflicts between the union leaders and the grass roots; these conflicts reveal processes of oligarchization, bureaucratization and relative nationalization of APEOC union, that foster its representativeness crisis, demobilizing the grass roots. Furthermore, the teaching staff perceived in their profession what GraÃa Druck names dismantling, what was confirmed by the analysis of laws related to the activity, besides how the Plan of Posts, Careers and Salaries was restructured after 2011. The dissertation concluded that the dismantling appears as a way of fragmentation of the category when it sprays teacherâs demands, what is enhanced by its intern fragmentation, namely, by the categoryâs intern conflicts related to the way the 2011 strike was ended...|$|E

For each of those stories, numerous news articles, posts, and social me-dia reactions are created, offering a multitude of viewpoints {{about what is happening}} around us. Many applications have tried to deal with this complexity from very different an-gles, targeting particular needs, reconstructing certain parts of the story, and exploiting certain visualization paradigms. In this paper, we identify those challenges and study how an adequate news story representation can effectively support the different phases of the news consumption process. We propose an innovative model called News Semantic Snap-shot (NSS) that is designed to capture the entire context of a news item. This model can feed very different applica-tions assisting the users before, during, and after the news story consumption. It formalizes a duality in the news an-notations that distinguishes between <b>representative</b> <b>entities</b> and relevant entities, and considers different relevancy di-mensions that are incorporated into the model in the form of concentric layers.

In this paper we focus on named entity disambiguation (NED) in twitter messages. NED in tweets is challenging in two ways. First, the limited length of Tweet makes it hard to have enough context while many disambiguation techniques depend on it. The second is that many named entities in tweets do not exist in a knowledge base (KB). In this paper we share ideas from information retrieval (IR) and NED to propose solutions for both challenges. For the first problem we make use of the gregarious nature of tweets to get enough context needed for disambiguation. For the second problem we look for an alternative home page if there is no Wikipedia page represents the entity. Given a mention, we obtain a list of Wikipedia candidates from YAGO KB in addition to top ranked pages from Google search engine.

In this paper, we propose an approach that automatically extracts represen-tative features of a news item, namely named entities, from textual content attached to a video item (subtitles) and from a set of documents from the Web collected using entity ex-pansion techniques. Approaches relying on entity expansion generally try to collect and process the important facts be-hinds a particular news item, but they are often too depen-dent on frequency-based functions and information retrieval techniques thus neglecting the multi-dimensional relation-ships that are established among the entities. We propose a concentric-based approach that enables to represent the con-text of a news item, by harmonizing into a single model the <b>representative</b> <b>entities,</b> which can be extracted using infor-mation retrieval and natural language processing techniques (Core), and other entities that get prominent according to different dimensions such as informativeness, semantic con-nectivity, or popularity (Crust).

Its frequent revisit time enables monitoring the Earth surface with high reliability. Since Sentinel- 2 data is provided free of charge by the European Space Agency, its mass use for variety of purposes is expected. Quality evaluation of Sentinel- 2 data is thus necessary. Quality analysis in this experiment is based on comparison of Sentinel- 2 imagery with reference data (orthophoto). From the possible set of features to compare (point features, texture lines, objects, etc.) line segments were chosen because visual analysis suggested that scale differences matter least for these features. The experiment was thus designed to compare long line segments (e. g. airstrips, roads, etc.) in both datasets as the most <b>representative</b> <b>entities.</b> Edge detection was applied to both images and corresponding edges were manually selected. The statistical parameter which describes the geometrical relation between different images (and between datasets in general) covering the same area is calculated as the distance between corresponding curves in two datasets.

The empirical research was conducted through interviews with agents from four <b>representative</b> <b>entities</b> of training and participant observation, sociopoetics and interviews with workers who participated in the Solidarity Economy Training Centre of South Brazil, a public policy implemented by Unisinos in the period of 2009 - 2012. The results showed political advances but also challenges to the democratic exercise of popular education, which requires a break with the hierarchy of knowledge and roles amid traditional contexts, procedures and instruments. These challenges are expressed through concrete conditions (insufficient resources and edicts that delimit deadlines and content – despite being a citizen achievement) and subjective (different conceptions of solidarity economy that trigger various methodological training options and conservative political-pedagogical legacies). Proposals revolved around increased participation of workers in training and easing of the edicts. The contradictions only confirmed that popular education is a process that challenges all people involved, with the utopia of building more democratic and supportive ways of producing and living as a point in common and unifying ideal. There is no formula or recipes in popular education, but constructed responses in ongoing dialogue across differences in dealing with contradictions and recreating practices and structures...|$|R
