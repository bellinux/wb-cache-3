25|$|Micropropagation, {{also known}} as tissue culture, is the {{practice}} of <b>rapidly</b> <b>multiplying</b> stock plant material to produce {{a large number of}} progeny plants. Micropropagation uses in vitro division of small pieces in a sterile environment, where they first produce proliferations of tissue, which are then separated into small pieces that are treated differently so that they produce roots and new stem tissue. The steps in the process are regulated by different ratios of plant growth regulators. Many commercial organizations have produced cannas this way, and specifically the “Island Series” of cannas was introduced by means of mass-produced plants using this technique. However, cannas have a reputation for being difficult micropropagation candidates.|$|E
500|$|Metroid Fusion: While {{acting as}} a {{bodyguard}} for researchers on the planet SR388, Samus is infected by a native creature known as the X Parasite, originally the prey of the Metroid species. Doctors surgically remove portions of her armor and cure the X infection with a vaccine created from the DNA of the Metroid hatchling (Metroid II: Return of Samus). The vaccine not only allows her to survive the parasites, but to absorb them to power up her energy and weapons. She is then sent to investigate a disturbance at the Biologic Space Labs research station, where it is revealed that specimens from SR388 had been carriers of the X parasite. An X mimicking Samus, nicknamed the SA-X, has taken control of Samus's old suit, methodically breaking into {{different parts of the}} station to allow the X parasites to infect the entire station. While trying to destroy the <b>rapidly</b> <b>multiplying</b> X as well as clones of the SA-X, Samus discovers a secret Federation Metroid breeding program. Before Samus can react, the SA-X discovers the lab and triggers a security system that ejects it into space, killing the Metroids (as the X Parasite and Metroid are natural enemies). The Federation eventually shifts interest towards researching the X parasite, especially the SA-X's capabilities, and orders the shipboard computer to prevent Samus from destroying it. Samus then convinces the computer, whom she had nicknamed [...] "Adam" [...] after her former Commanding Officer, that the X pose a threat to galactic civilization, claiming that the arriving Federation troops will be overwhelmed by the multiple SA-X patrolling the ship. Adam, in a sudden change of heart, suggests that she alter the station's propulsion to intercept with SR388 to destroy the planet and wipe out both X populations. After fighting one of the SA-X clones and changing the station's propulsion, Samus races back to her ship, where she encounters an Omega Metroid which seems to have escaped the laboratory breach. The SA-X returns and tries to kill the Metroid, since the ice-beam it has seems to be the only weapon able to damage it, but the SA-X is badly damaged in the battle. Samus absorbs the SA-X parasite to regain her suit's Energy, defeats the Omega Metroid and leaves the station before it collides with SR388. It was released on the Game Boy Advance.|$|E

Despite normal B cell development in CD 21 / 35 −/− mice, T cell-independent and -dependent antibody responses to low-dose antigens were significantly decreased, with a striking impairment in IgG 3 responses. Accordingly, CD 21 / 35 −/− mice were more susceptible to acute lethal Streptococcus pneumoniae infection. Thus, CD 21 / 35 expression is critical for early protective antibody responses to lethal pathogens that <b>rapidly</b> <b>multiply</b> and quickly overwhelm the immune system...|$|R

Methods :  In this study, two groups of fertile eggs were inoculated with 20 CFU of hilA or parent strains of S. enteritidis.
