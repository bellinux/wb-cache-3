40|$|Background: The aim of {{intervention}} for unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) is safe, effective treatment. Objective: To analyze a prospective database for variables influencing {{the risk of}} surgery to produce a risk model adjusting this risk for effectively treated aneurysms. Methods: First, we identified variables to create a model from multiple logistic regression for complications of surgery leading to a 12 -month modified Rankin Scale score > 1. Second, we established the long-term cumulative incidence of freedom from <b>retreatment</b> <b>or</b> rupture (treated aneurysm) from Kaplan-Meier analysis. Third, we combined these analyses to establish a model of risk of surgery per effective treatment. Results: One thousand twelve patients with 1440 UIA underwent 1080 craniotomies. We found that 10. 1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 8. 4 - 12. 0) of craniotomies resulted in a complication leading to a modified Rankin Scale score > 1 at 12 months. Logistic regression found age (odds ratio, 1. 04; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 06), size (odds ratio, 1. 12; 95 % CI, 1. 09 - 1. 15), and posterior circulation location (odds ratio, 2. 95; 95 % CI, 1. 82 - 4. 78) to be significant. Cumulative 10 -year risk of <b>retreatment</b> <b>or</b> rupture was 3. 0 % (95 % CI, 1. 3 - 7. 0). The complication-effectiveness model was derived by dividing the complication risk by the 10 -year cumulative freedom from <b>retreatment</b> <b>or</b> rupture proportion. Risk per effective treatment ranged from 1 % for a 5 -mm anterior circulation UIA in a 20 -year-old patient to 70 % for a giant posterior circulation UIA in a 70 -year-old patient. Conclusion: Complication-effectiveness analyses increase the information available with regard to outcome {{for the management of}} UIAs. 12 page(s...|$|R
