50|$|In May 1940, the {{squadron}} was created {{from the former}} 1680 Flight at Doncaster, in a transport <b>role.</b> <b>Equipment</b> mostly consisted of the Handley Page Harrow, supplemented with the Bristol Bombay and civil airliners impressed into military service, including the Handley Page H.P.42s from Imperial Airways.|$|E
50|$|Because of the {{specialist}} nature of operations in Northern Ireland, a particularly {{important piece of}} <b>role</b> <b>equipment</b> {{was introduced in the}} form of the 'Nightsun' 3.5 million candle power searchlight. Operations at night were greatly enhanced with the introduction of Night Vision Goggles (NVGs), although these missions could still be hazardous. This was evident on the night of 2 December 1978, when the pilot of XW614, 659 Sqn, became disorientated during a sortie and crashed into Lough Ross, killing the two crew. XW614 was the last of five Scouts written off during operations in the Province.|$|E

The research uses a structured qualitative approach {{in order to examine}} the communication of the rescue scripting (moral orientation, <b>roles,</b> <b>equipment,</b> rescue scenarios) of these pro-social action toys in terms of 1) whether the boys are interested in and comprehend the character traits and roles; 2) whether a video which shows the rescue roles enacted in a cartoon influences the way boys play, and 3) whether this way of encouraging non-aggressive action play is supported and valued by their mothers after a one week in-home trial.

50|$|The Scout AH Mk 1 was {{operated}} by the Army Air Corps on general light work, including observation and liaison. Like the Wasp, the Scout could be fitted out with different <b>role</b> <b>equipment</b> including flotation gear and a Lucas, air-driven hoist which had a lift capacity of 600 lb. In the light attack role, it was capable of carrying one pintle machine gun in the rear cabin (it is possible to carry two pintle-mounted GPMGs in the cabin, although this would, unsurprisingly, be somewhat cramped) or two forward-firing 7.62mm L7 General Purpose Machine Guns (GPMGs) fixed to the undercarriage skid. These GPMG combinations were sometimes used in unison to great effect.|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} family caregivers' {{responses to a}} National Inquiry into the Social Impact of Caregiving for Terminally Ill, initiated by Palliative Care Australia, which aimed to influence policy and practice to support caregivers. Caregivers recounted their experiences of supporting a dying relative and reported their unmet needs and the impact that the caregiving role had on their financial, physical and psychosocial wellbeing. The issues raised by caregivers were consistent with data obtained from a wide cross-section of service providers {{and a number of}} findings were congruent with empirical literature related to family caregiving. Caregivers' reports confirm that, to maintain their health and well-being, they need adequate resources, fairer remuneration, quality respite care, education about the <b>role,</b> <b>equipment,</b> psychosocial support, home-help, improved access to the paid workforce and to gain community recognition. Such collected evidence reinforced the importance of policy responses and resource allocations that are focused on helping caregivers perform a vital role into the future...|$|E
2500|$|Airbus Helicopters has {{promoted}} the airframe's various configurations as possessing [...] "unique adaptability" [...] for various missions, including utility work, commercial transportation, and training <b>roles.</b> <b>Equipment</b> {{for the law}} enforcement role include external loudspeakers, rappelling system, search lights with laser pointers, left or right-mounted hoists, and electro-optical sensors. For offshore oil & gas operations, the rotorcraft can be fitted with weather/search radars, emergency floatation aids (including an automated external life raft), energy-absorbent seating, class-D certified external hoists, and crash-resistant fuel cells. An external hook can be installed to carry underslung loads of up to 272kg for cargo missions. In a training capacity, features such a light aircraft recording system (for post-flight analysis), intuitive human-machine interface, specific training modules, and a one-engine inoperative training mode, and full ground simulators, may be selected.|$|R

In addition, as it was mentioned before, this mixture can be utilized as asphaltene solvent in enhanced oil recovery processes. Therefore, knowledge of physical properties such as density, viscosity, surface tension, and excess molar volume of DSO and gas condensate along with their mixtures can play a vital <b>role</b> in <b>equipment</b> design [14].|$|R

The choice of these particular variables is essential to diagnose e ciently a system. Eventually, the diagnosis performance can be quanti ed through the detection and isolation times...|$|R

Here we focus on the initial phase of electrification, from the 1880 s to 1914, when multinational enterprise and international finance played a crucial <b>role.</b> Electrical <b>equipment</b> manufacturers were first movers in the establishment of operating electric utilities; however, since electric power facilities were highly capital intensive, outside investors needed to be brought in. Utility holding companies with very complex capital structures became major players in the establishment of electric utilities around the world, as did British ?free-standing? companies. We discuss some of the European and British companies that brought light and power to the cities of the world. ...|$|R

30|$|Within the U.S. port terminal, {{the terms}} of the Uniform Intermodal Interchange Agreement (UIIA) require that the {{equipment}} provider make known equipment return locations prior to 1600  h. Otherwise, the motor carrier will return the equipment to the location where it was originally interchanged. Some equipment providers do this on their own websites or through group efforts such as www.returnlocation.com. The UIIA {{is in the process of}} building a matrix for all equipment providers on their own website. Recently, however, supply chain partners have been unilaterally changing standard terms for their own benefit, disrupting the carrier plans. We suggest that the carrier alliances could have a greater <b>role</b> in <b>equipment</b> returns within ports as part of a Service Agreement.|$|R
50|$|From {{the middle}} of the 19th century on, the {{creation}} of organized and resourced transport, medical, ordnance and supply corps {{as an integral part of}} regular armies marked the end of reliance on camp followers in most European armies. However, in much of the world the concept of numerous civilian workers, family members and hangers-on accompanying armies survived into the 20th century, either for reasons of local culture or in the absence of formal support services. A notable example was the Mexican Revolution of 1910-20, where female soldaderas filling traditional camp <b>roles,</b> carrying <b>equipment</b> and often acting as combatants were a marked feature of Zapatista, Villistas and Federale forces at all times.|$|R
