The event was created in 2002 and is supported by animal welfare groups, including PETA, who object to <b>the</b> <b>Running</b> of <b>the</b> Bulls, claiming that the event is cruel and glorifies bullfighting, which the groups oppose. In <b>the</b> <b>Running</b> of <b>the</b> Nudes, naked humans, many wearing only plastic horns and red scarves, follow the same route taken by <b>the</b> <b>Running</b> of <b>the</b> Bulls, from the Santo Domingo corrals through the town’s streets, ending at the Plaza de Toros.

She also probably helped her husband decide to provide more than one million dollars toward achieving the Roeriches' spiritual and cultural ambitions. She met with the Roeriches and their other supporters in making plans for the Roerich Museum, Master Institute, Corona Mundi, and the other organizations housed in the Master Building. She was active as president of the Roerich Society and, after its demise, directed the Riverside Museum for many years.|$|E
