50|$|Maersk also {{aimed at}} serving the <b>inclusive</b> <b>tours</b> charter market. To gain {{better access to}} the market, Maersk bought two travel agents in December 1971, Raffels Rejser and Bangs Rejser.

Unisol—Denmark's third largest <b>inclusive</b> <b>tours</b> travel agency—was placed under the industrial department in Maersk, while the airline reported directly to the executive administration. This caused a lack of coordination between the companies and Maersk never made money from the <b>inclusive</b> <b>tours</b> operations. After having lost 100 million Danish krone (DKK) by 1979, Unison was sold to Tjæreborg in 1980.|$|R

25|$|BEA Airtours {{was formed}} on 24 April 1969 as a {{division}} of BEA to provide it with a low cost platform {{to participate in the}} then rapidly growing <b>inclusive</b> <b>tour</b> (IT) holiday flights market, which until then had been the exclusive domain of wholly privately owned airlines independent from the government-owned corporation BEA and BOAC. BEA saw this as a necessary counterweight to the independents' rapidly growing scheduled activities that began encroaching on what BEA and BOAC had traditionally regarded as their sole preserve. BEA Airtours' formation was in line with one of the recommendations of the Edwards Report on the future of British air industry - that the corporations should enter the <b>inclusive</b> <b>tour</b> and charter market.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the reasons why foreign tourists travelling to Istanbul for cultural purposes prefer all <b>inclusive</b> package <b>tours.</b> The sample group consisted of foreign tourists who visited Istanbul on an all <b>inclusive</b> package <b>tour</b> between May and July of 2013. Data were obtained from 397 tourists for the study by using a survey to measure the preference for all <b>inclusive</b> package <b>tours.</b> Descriptive analyses such as mean, standard deviation as well as statistical tests such as factor analysis, reliability analysis, t-test and variance analysis were used to analyze the obtained data. The study revealed that the main reasons why foreign tourists coming to Istanbul preferred all <b>inclusive</b> package <b>tours</b> were tour arrangements & service quality, attractions, hotels & airlines. In other words it was evident that when foreign tourists preferred all <b>inclusive</b> package <b>tours</b> when coming to Istanbul they prioritized issues such as the experience of the travel agency, its reputation and the service quality of the tour. Furthermore it was determined that in their preference for all <b>inclusive</b> package <b>tours</b> foreign tourists also underlined the importance of historical and cultural attractions as well as natural attractions, the quality of hotels and the amenities they provided...|$|R

40|$|This thesis explores how tourism policy, if {{based on}} evidence, can {{contribute}} to the objective of destination competitiveness. Evidence-based policy-making is informed by high-quality research formulated using rigorous, scientific methods. The thesis aims to show that policy analysis applied to the macro and micro levels can create evidence for use in policy formulation. The research is set within the Mediterranean context, with particular emphasis on Malta’s competitiveness within the <b>inclusive</b> <b>tour</b> holiday market originating from the United Kingdom. Using economic theory and econometrics, the thesis demonstrates the potential usefulness of econometric modelling in conducting such policy analysis. This is done by firstly estimating the effect of the Maltese government’s policy to subsidise tour operators on a set of destinations’ price and income elasticities, given that elasticities are deemed to be a good measure of destination competitiveness. These estimates are carried out through the application of the Almost Ideal Demand System model. Secondly, the price competitiveness of <b>inclusive</b> <b>tour</b> holidays is examined by applying the characteristics theory of value and the hedonic pricing model. The effect on package prices of <b>inclusive</b> <b>tour</b> holiday characteristics and of macroeconomic variables, including destinations’ relative prices, is quantified. The effect of the subsidisation policy is also estimated. The policy analysis results are then interpreted against the destination competitiveness frameworks. The implications for government policies and those of firms are discussed in relation to how destination competitiveness in the <b>inclusive</b> <b>tour</b> holiday market can accordingly be achieved through evidence-based policies. The findings clearly indicate that destinations can benefit significantly in terms of competitiveness by adopting an evidence-based approach to tourism policy-making. It is shown that government and the private sector have a key role to play for destinations to achieve competitiveness through the policies they adopt, highlighting the importance of informed and strategic approaches to governance...|$|R
