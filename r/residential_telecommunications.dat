40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to re-contextualize prior {{negotiation}} theory emanating from the field of communications in a unique contemporary setting. The research focuses on the Canadian <b>residential</b> <b>telecommunications</b> sector, where the dominant business model involves the use of a rather peculiar variable pricing strategy, which has compelled a proportion of consumers to adopt competitive negotiation strategies. Through a series of three focus groups, the project gleans insight into the participants’ experiences and perceptions of the telecommunications procurement process. Based on prior theoretical assumptions and on this original research, the study tests the appropriateness of descriptive phase models of negotiation in the Canadian telecommunications industry, providing a new dimension to the nascent body of academic research in this area...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse residential demand by traffic destination, using a translogarithmic indirect utility function. We focus on five traffic directions, in order to construct a model adapted to evaluate the characteristics of telecommunications demand in a competitive market. The resulting price elasticities express high reactivity to own price changes for the main traffic directions, as well as little interactions between the different types of traffic. Moreover, the high values of income elasticities confirm the importance of income effects when analysing <b>residential</b> <b>telecommunications</b> demand. This model shows useful for welfare analysis. The computation of customers' income equivalent variation shows, on average, a higher willingness to pay for some traffic directions than the bill actually paid. Finally, we show that the optimal prices for the operator, in a cost minimisation point of view, are higher than the observed prices for local and national traffic directions. This emphasises the existence of important cross-subsidies among the different segments of customers...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the open access debate {{in the context of}} cable {{services}} and broadband Internet services from an antitrust framework. Our analysis is prompted by the recent AT 2 ̆ 6 T-MediaOne and AOL-Time Warner mergers, which raise issues concerning the impact of integrated cable content and Internet access to <b>residential</b> <b>telecommunications.</b> Economic analysis, demographic surveys and federal antitrust guidelines each indicate that the broadband Internet access market is distinct from the narrowband Internet access market. Emerging or competing technologies, such as satellite Internet services or digital subscriber lines, cannot discipline the broadband Internet access market over the relevant time horizons. Vertical integration increases the incentives and power of cable providers to discriminate against unaffiliated broadband content, thereby substantially decreasing consumer welfare. We conclude that the recent mergers of cable content and Internet access is the most current manifestation of the classic strategy of cable providers to control alternate channels of content distribution...|$|E

40|$|This report investigates how {{advances}} in telecommunications-based technologies could aid in making transportation more sustainable. The first task examined {{the effect of}} telecommunications on work and shopping trips. The second task focused on how transit could be improved through new technology; specifically, whether the addition of GPS-based technology to flexible, on-demand “paratransit ” services {{has the potential to}} serve the general public. The third task considered how wireless telecommunications, particularly e- 911 services, could improve transportation system safety in rural areas. These efforts found that particular opportunities exist. Advances in <b>residential</b> broadband <b>telecommunications</b> may lead to increased travel, which demonstrates a need for increased collaboration between telecommunication and transportation infrastructure planning. Similarly, emergency response services would benefit from increased cooperation between transportation agencies, local telecommunications providers, and emergency response services. Finally, new GPS technologies create opportunities for paratransit services to provide trips to the general public as a complement to existing fixed-route services in areas with low population densities. Finally, more research is needed, as careful targeting of the improvements would maximize the benefits from these developments. A particular area of need is in understanding inter-organizational process, as these recommendation...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares {{barriers}} to entry in the broadband markets between the U. S. and South Korea. First, it explores economic conceptions of {{barriers to}} entry from the economics literature. Second, it speculates on how the conception of {{barriers to entry}} has been {{dealt with in the}} telecommunications industry. It clarifies the various industrial factors that could prevent, or make it difficult, to successfully enter the <b>residential</b> <b>telecommunications</b> market. Third, it introduces an analytical framework that can be adopted for evaluating the barriers to entry. Fourth, employing that framework, it examines the broadband markets in the U. S. and in South Korea, focusing on barriers to entry in multiple broadband access platforms. Both the U. S. and South Korea have shown greater barriers to entry in wireline broadband markets such as cable modem and DSL compared to wireless broadband {{when it comes to a}} facilities-based entry. South Korea has offered more opportunity to non-dominant ISPs as new entrants and thus, has been able to facilitate more vibrant competition nationwide. This paper concludes with an analysis of the barriers to entry for alternative broadband access platforms in residential high speed Internet services, more specifically, wireless access technologies, including othe...|$|E
