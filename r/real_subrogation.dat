40|$|This work {{tries to}} {{establish}} three general {{requirements of the}} doctrine of <b>real</b> <b>subrogation</b> under Korean private law. The work argues that the following three elements are needed in applying the doctrine: (1) a pre-existing legal relationship binding the defendant; (2) substitution of an asset for another; and (3) statutory ground. The doctrine of <b>real</b> <b>subrogation</b> has commonly been understood as a means used when those who have security interests want to assert their pre-existing proprietary interests over the substitutes in the hand of their defendant. However, the work proves that the doctrine is not a terrain only for those security right-holders under the current Korean private law. They are also available for those entitled to enjoy benefits arising from the devise, donatio mortis causa, and trusts. Deduced from the analyses of the mechanism {{of the doctrine of}} <b>real</b> <b>subrogation</b> used in those cases are the three aforementioned requirements. And they show us that the doctrine can potentially be used much wider than it has been, and, contrary to some trust lawyersâ€™ argument, the nature of the doctrine adopted in the law of trusts is not different from that recognised in the law of security since they all share the three general requirements presented in this work...|$|E

The Court granted priority to the former, relying on {{the argument that the}} latter could not acquire more rights than these belonging to the re-seller. The decision is closely related to the principle of "real subrogation" ("tracing"), which exists of the substitution in the object of a proprietary interest. Indeed, the priority conflict as mentioned only arises if the proprietary right of the original seller under title retention is maintained on the claim out of the resale. This implies the substitution of the originally sold assets by the claim out of the sub-sale as object of the proprietary right. The decision witnesses of the possible far reaching consequences of <b>real</b> <b>subrogation</b> within the field of security law. The judgment is analysed in the following comparative comment from the perspective of French, German, English, Dutch and Belgian law...|$|E
