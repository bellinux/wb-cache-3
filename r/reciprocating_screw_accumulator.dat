40|$|This paper deals with, the {{solution}} of problem occurred for <b>reciprocating</b> <b>screw</b> of Injection molding machine. It identifies and solves the problem by using the modeling and simulation techniques. The problem occurred in the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>screw</b> of machine which was wearing of threads due to affect of temperature of mold materials (flow materials) i. e. Nylon, low density polypropylene, polystyrene, PVC etc., The main work was to model the components of machine with dimensions, assemble those components and then simulate the whole assembly for rotation of the screw. The modeling software used is PRO-E wildfire 4. 0 for modeling the machine components like body, movable platen, fixed platen, barrel, screw, nozzle, etc. The analysis software ANSYS is {{used to analyze the}} <b>reciprocating</b> <b>screws.</b> The objectives involved are:-• To model all the components using modeling software Pro-E 4. 0 • To assemble all the components of the machine in the software. • To make the assembly run in Pro-E software. • Analysis of screw of machine using Ansys 11. 0 software. • To identify the wearing of threads and to provide the possible solutions. This problem is major for all industrial injection molding machines which the industries are facing and they need the permanent solution, so if the better solution is achieved then the industries will think for implementing it. The industries are having temporary solution but it will affect the life of the screw, because the stresses will be more in machined screw on lathe machine as compared to normal screw.

A uniform temperature was provided in the barrel by using a circulating hot oil system. Standard capillary rheometry methods can provide the dependence of thermoset apparent viscosity on shear rate, temperature, and time. Process conditions resulting in complete imidization should be carefully defined. Specification of controlled oven temperature is inadequate and can result in incomplete imidization.

40|$|Plastic {{injection}} moulding machines are a positive {{example of the}} possibilities in terms of performance and energy efficiency of modern hydraulic drives technology. In addition to the performance and energy efficiency of the machines, {{the quality of the}} plastic mouldings and an easy to use machines control is the focus. To ensure a constant plastics part quality the set process parameters of the {{injection moulding}} machines are kept constant by appropriate closed loop control strategies today. Assuming a constant quality of the processed plastic raw material, this strategy is effective. If it comes to a qualitative variation in the processed plastics, which often leads to a change in viscosity of the plastics melt, keeping processing parameters constant will not lead to a constant quality of the moulded parts. The deviations in the plastics viscosity have such a great influence on the moulding process that the relevant process parameters have to be adjusted manually in many cases. Often the stroke of the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>screw</b> system has to be adapted to reach a constant filling volume of the cavity and therefore avoid burr formation or short shots. In this paper an approach for adaptive process control is introduced. This control loop is able to correct the set points of specific machines parameters online within the production cycle and therefore is able to avoid changes in the produced parts quality...|$|R
5000|$|In [...] Extrusion Blow Molding (EBM), plastic {{is melted}} and {{extruded}} {{into a hollow}} tube (a parison). This parison is then captured by closing it into a cooled metal mold. Air is then blown into the parison, inflating it {{into the shape of}} the hollow bottle, container, or part. After the plastic has cooled sufficiently, the mold is opened and the part is ejected. [...] Continuous and Intermittent are two variations of Extrusion Blow Molding. In Continuous Extrusion Blow Molding the parison is extruded continuously and the individual parts are cut off by a suitable knife. In Intermittent blow molding there are two processes: straight intermittent is similar to injection molding whereby the screw turns, then stops and pushes the melt out. With the accumulator method, an accumulator gathers melted plastic and when the previous mold has cooled and enough plastic has accumulated, a rod pushes the melted plastic and forms the parison. In this case the screw may turn continuously or intermittently. With continuous extrusion the weight of the parison drags the parison and makes calibrating the wall thickness difficult. The <b>accumulator</b> head or <b>reciprocating</b> <b>screw</b> methods use hydraulic systems to push the parison out quickly reducing the effect of the weight and allowing precise control over the wall thickness by adjusting the die gap with a parison programming device.|$|R

5|$|When {{thermoplastics}} are moulded, typically pelletised {{raw material}} is fed through a hopper into a heated barrel with a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>screw.</b> Upon {{entrance to the}} barrel, the temperature increases and the Van der Waals forces that resist relative flow of individual chains are weakened {{as a result of}} increased space between molecules at higher thermal energy states. This process reduces its viscosity, which enables the polymer to flow with the driving force of the injection unit. The screw delivers the raw material forward, mixes and homogenises the thermal and viscous distributions of the polymer, and reduces the required heating time by mechanically shearing the material and adding a significant amount of frictional heating to the polymer. The material feeds forward through a check valve and collects {{at the front of the}} screw into a volume known as a shot. A shot is the volume of material that is used to fill the mould cavity, compensate for shrinkage, and provide a cushion (approximately 10% of the total shot volume, which remains in the barrel and prevents the screw from bottoming out) to transfer pressure from the screw to the mould cavity. When enough material has gathered, the material is forced at high pressure and velocity into the part forming cavity. To prevent spikes in pressure, the process normally uses a transfer position corresponding to a 95–98% full cavity where the screw shifts from a constant velocity to a constant pressure control. Often injection times are well under 1 second. Once the screw reaches the transfer position the packing pressure is applied, which completes mould filling and compensates for thermal shrinkage, which is quite high for thermoplastics relative to many other materials. The packing pressure is applied until the gate (cavity entrance) solidifies. Due to its small size, the gate is normally the first place to solidify through its entire thickness. Once the gate solidifies, no more material can enter the cavity; accordingly, the <b>screw</b> <b>reciprocates</b> and acquires material for the next cycle while the material within the mould cools so that it can be ejected and be dimensionally stable. This cooling duration is dramatically reduced by the use of cooling lines circulating water or oil from an external temperature controller. Once the required temperature has been achieved, the mould opens and an array of pins, sleeves, strippers, etc. are driven forward to demould the article. Then, the mould closes and the process is repeated.|$|R

50|$|A chiller is a {{refrigeration}} unit designed to produce cool (chilled) water for space cooling purposes.The chilled water is then circulated {{to one or}} more cooling coils located in air handling units, fan-coils, or induction units. Chilled water distribution is not constrained by the 100 foot separation limit that applies to DX systems, thus chilled water-based cooling systems are typically used in larger buildings. Capacity control in a chilled water system is usually achieved through modulation of water flow through the coils; thus, multiple coils may be served from a single chiller without compromising control of any individual unit.Chillers may operate on either the vapor compression principle or the absorption principle. Vapor compression chillers may utilize <b>reciprocating,</b> centrifugal, <b>screw,</b> or rotary compressor configurations. Reciprocating chillers are commonly used for capacities below 200 tons; centrifugal chillers are normally used to provide higher capacities; rotary and screw chillers are less commonly used, but are not rare. Heat rejection from a chiller may be by way of an air-cooled condenser or a cooling tower (both discussed below). Vapor compression chillers may be bundled with an air-cooled condenser to provide a packaged chiller, which would be installed outside of the building envelope. Vapor compression chillers may also be designed to be installed separate from the condensing unit; normally such a chiller would be installed in an enclosed central plant space. Absorption chillers are designed to be installed separate from the condensing unit.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{constantly}} rising {{energy demand}} and {{the depletion of}} fossil fuel resources currently represent the main concerns for global energy sustainability, alongside environmental issues. Low-grade energy sources have moved into the limelight and Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) technology {{is well known for}} its suitability to recover waste heat. The optimization of the expansion process of an ORC system is crucial in order to maximize the power output, to increase the overall efficiency, and to obtain an economically feasible machine. Scroll, <b>reciprocating,</b> single <b>screw,</b> twin-screw and vane-type expanders are the main technologies. Screw expanders are particularly suited for low-grade heat recovery. The advantages of single screw technology over twin-screw include the balanced loading of the main screw, long working life, high volumetric efficiency, low leakage, low noise, low vibration, and a simplified configuration. In this paper, a detailed geometry-based model of a single screw expander is presented. The model is based on a rotation-dependent function that completely describes the geometry of the screw rotor and the engaging surfaces of the star wheels. A computation of the swept volume at each angular step and of the inlet conditions leads to a solution of the system of differential equations governing the thermodynamics of the expansion process. The model considers heat losses, oil-flooded mixing and leakage paths and permits the investigation of the impact of design modifications on the expander performance. Furthermore, the validation of the proposed model against the available literature is presented...|$|R

40|$|Positive {{displacement}} machines (e. g. scroll, twin <b>screw,</b> <b>reciprocating,</b> etc.) {{are proven}} to be suitable as expanders for organic Rankine cycle (ORC) applications, especially in the medium to low power range. However, {{in order to increase}} their performance, detailed simulation models are required to optimize the design and reduce the internal losses. In recent years, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been applied for the design and analysis of positive displacement machines (both compressors and expanders) with numerous challenges due to the dynamics of the expansion (or compression) process and deforming working chambers. The majority of the studies reported in literature focused on scroll, twin <b>screw</b> and <b>reciprocating</b> machines. Furthermore, the limitation of such methodologies to be applied directly to complex multi-rotor machines has been highlighted in literature. In this paper, a single screw expander (SSE) is used as benchmark to evaluate the applicability of different grid generation methodologies (dynamic remeshing and Chimera strategy overlapping grid), in terms of computational resources required, accuracy of the results and limitations. Although, the low-order models have been applied to single screw machines, there is still a lack of CFD analyses due to the particular complexity of the machine geometry and of its working principle. The calculations have been performed with air to reduce the complexity of the problem. to the main results are two folds: (i) the assessment of a numerical strategy with respect to the most critical parameters of a dynamic mesh-based simulation and (ii) the comparison of the pressure field and internal flow features obtained by using different numerical approaches...|$|R
40|$|It {{has long}} been {{established}} that for a Positive Displacement (PD) compressor or expander such as <b>reciprocating</b> or rotary <b>screw</b> type, the thermodynamic process is adiabatic when compressor or expander discharge pressure is equal to system back pressure (or 100 % internal compression or expansion). At this design point, compressor or expander efficiency and noise are most desirable. But more often, PD compressor or expander operates at off-design points where the discharge pressure is either lower or higher than the system back pressure caused by the inherent nature of possessing a fixed built-in volume ratio. The resulting processes are often called an Under-Compression abbreviated as UC (or Over-Expansion, OE) and an Over-Compression, OC (or Under-Expansion, UE), and the thermodynamic process suddenly changes to iso-choric (constant volume). The compressor or expander efficiency and noise become worse at these off-design conditions and some type of controls are always desired such as a variable geometry {{in order to minimize}} the losses. On the other hand, there have been test observations that seem to contradict the conventional theory, pointing to the dramatic difference of the thermodynamic processes between an UC and internal compression. So questions arise: What is the true thermodynamic process of an UC? What really does the compression at the instant when the gas is exposed to higher system pressure? How is energy exchanged during an UC cycle? And why does UC possess the unique self-adjusting capability to different system pressures? This paper attempts to re-exam these questions by applying the 1 st Law of Thermodynamics to UC (or OE) mode. It will be demonstrated that an UC (or OE) may inherently be an adiabatic process with compression achieved by a “flexible” backflow rather than a “rigid” piston or lobe. The energy exchange, in addition to work input from shaft to gas, is assisted by a dynamic process of “borrow and return” with the discharge system. It will be further explored that the mechanism of backflow compression is in essence a wave compression as illustrated by the Shock Tube Theory. Potential efficiency of an UC or OE could be close to the classical internal compression if the high velocity backflow is managed properly. But the best or maybe the most overlooked property seems to be its “feedback” capability, that is, an UC is a self-correcting, negative feedback control loop capable of meeting different system back pressures without using any variable geometry. A Roots type blower is used as an extreme example of UC to illustrate the new theory...|$|R
