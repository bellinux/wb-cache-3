40|$|As Cloud Computing becomes popular, {{more and}} more data owners prefer to store their data into the cloud for great {{flexibility}} and economic savings. In {{order to protect the}} data privacy, sensitive data usually have to be encrypted before outsourcing, which makes effective data utilization a challenging task. Although traditional searchable symmetric encryption schemes allow users to securely search over encrypted data through keywords and selectively retrieve files of interest without capturing any <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> files or search keywords, and fuzzy keyword search on encrypted data allows minor typos and format inconsistencies, secure ranked keyword search captures the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> files and returns the results that are wanted most by users. These techniques function unilaterally, which greatly reduces the system usability and efficiency. In this paper, for the first time, we define and solve the problem of privacypreserving ranked fuzzy keyword search over encrypted cloud data. Ranked fuzzy keyword search greatly enhances system usability and efficiency when exact match fails. It returns the matching files in a ranked order with respect to certain relevance criteria (e. g., keyword frequency) based on keyword similarity semantics. In our solution, we exploit the edit distance to quantify keyword similarity and dictionary-based fuzzy set construction to construct fuzzy keyword sets, which greatly reduces the index size, storage and communication costs. We choose the efficient similarity measure of “coordinate matching”, i. e., as many matches as possible, to obtain the <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> <b>data</b> files to the search keywords.

40|$|Applying an option-based {{valuation}} approach, {{we develop}} and test {{a model that}} addresses the incremental value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> segment <b>data</b> beyond firm-level accounting data. Prior studies (e. g., Zhang 2000; Biddle et al. 2001) show that firm value relates to accounting data (in part) because accounting data are useful for guiding capital investment decisions that underlie value creation. In this study, we establish that the incremental value <b>relevance</b> <b>of</b> segment <b>data</b> relates to heterogeneity of investment decisions across segments, as informed by segmental profitability and investment opportunities. Equity value is predicted to depend not only on aggregate firm-level accounting data {{but also on the}} extent to which segments differ in profitability and investment opportunities.
