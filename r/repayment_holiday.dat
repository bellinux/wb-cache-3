5000|$|On the {{financial}} side rumours abounded. In July 2009, Bill Bratt spoke out to publicly deny rumours spread on Vale fan sites, specifically rumours of sponsorship deals with Basement Jaxx and Maplin Electronics. Bratt said the rumours were [...] "inaccurate, spurious and damaging", claiming the speculation could damage genuine and confidential negotiations. In November, Bratt {{announced that he}} was planning to retire as chairman {{at the end of the}} season, though he later decided to stay on. Reports that Andy Townsend would be appointed as a football advisor also surfaced, but never transpired. There also came statements that shirt sponsors Harlequin Property would invest £500,000 into the club, though again this never materialized. Stoke-on-Trent city council gave the club a two-year <b>repayment</b> <b>holiday</b> for a £2.25 million loan taken out in 2005.|$|E

5000|$|Facing an EGM, Chaudry's {{cause was}} boosted when Broxap CEO Robert Lee {{announced}} that he would sell his £50,000 worth of shares to Chaudry, making the board's removal at the EGM more likely (however Broxap later reversed their decision {{on the day of the}} EGM). However just ten days before the EGM Bratt announced a ten-year £1.6 million sponsorship deal with Ameriturf Global Sports. A further twist came five days later, when Robbie Williams handed his 24.9% worth of EGM proxy votes over to Port Vale Supporters' Club. Many believed this would ensure the end of Bratt's reign, despite his warning that fans should [...] "look at other clubs who have gone down this line and they have no longer got their ground and are paying vast sums in rent". The result of the EGM was a vote of no confidence in the board; directors Peter Jackson and Stan Meigh were voted out, however the controversial '24.9% rule' survived - to Chaudry's disappointment. Also remaining were chairman Bill Bratt and directors Glenn Oliver and Mike Lloyd, three of the original nine that started the season. Each facing an individual vote, they received 51.07%, 50.64%, and 50.21% of the vote respectively. The three survived as Broxap sold their shares to an unnamed director at the last minute, not to Chaudry as they had originally promised. Speaking of the change of heart from Broxap, Chaudry stated that [...] "the board have engaged in dirty tricks from day one and there have been more at the 11th hour." [...] Many fans expressed disappointment at the result, though Chaudry again announced he [...] "will not walk away". The future remained unclear, with both Bratt and Chaudry taking gains and losses from the EGM. The club's constitution required four directors for the board to be considered valid, and so the board welcomed new director Mark Sims, a Chaudry supporter, who was voted on to the board at the EGM after he was sponsored by Robbie Williams. Sims stated his intention of convincing the three original directors of the merits of Chaudry's bid. The board also invited supporters group North London Valiants to nominate a director. The EGM disrupted manager Micky Adams' transfer plans as the club's constitution stipulated that at least four directors must be in place for financial transactions such as issuing new contracts to take place. In a shock move Adams {{announced that he}} intended to take up a directorship at the club, purchasing £50,000 worth of shares with his own money (though former director Stan Meigh later said that it was he who provided the money) he declared that [...] "this is a purely footballing decision... I understand that the last few months have been difficult for everyone and am asking all of our supporters to put their differences aside, to support my candidacy for the Board and then to get behind the team in the coming season." [...] Supporters' groups opposed to Bill Bratt's chairmanship did not welcome the news. At the end of the season, Stoke-on-Trent city council confirmed that the two-year <b>repayment</b> <b>holiday</b> for a £2.25 million loan taken out in 2005 had come to an end.|$|E
