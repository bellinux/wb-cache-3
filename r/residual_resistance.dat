40|$|Residual {{forces are}} {{compressive}} {{forces in a}} pile caused during pile driving due to elastic compression of the pile material and the rebound of the soil below the pile toe, {{as well as local}} deformation of the pile section. Residual forces have significant effects on pile driveability and the interpretation of pile behaviour. Eleven instrumented long steel H-piles with lengths between 34 - 60 m were driven into a construction site in Hong Kong and the residual forces were monitored. Based on field measured results, a method for estimating residual forces in long driven pile in weather soils is suggested. The analysis shows that the dimensionless pile flexibility factor and the toe capacity are two key factors influencing the <b>residual</b> toe <b>resistance.</b> The <b>residual</b> toe <b>resistances</b> in long driven piles increase with the pile length, the soil stiffness along the pile and the ultimate toe resistance, and decrease with the pile cross section area and material modulus. For the test piles founded in CDG with SPT-N values greater than 200, the unit <b>residual</b> toe <b>resistance</b> is approximately 25 % of the ultimate toe resistance of the pile. The <b>residual</b> toe <b>residual</b> <b>resistances</b> in piles in weathered soils are larger than those in piles in sand.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} high temperature treatments followed by only high-pressure water rinse (HPR) of superconducting radio frequency (SRF) niobium cavities. The objective {{is to provide a}} cost effective alternative to the typical cavity processing sequence, by eliminating the material removal step post furnace treatment while preserving or improving the RF performance. The studies have been conducted in the temperature range 800 - 1000 C for different conditions of the starting substrate: large grain and fine grain, electro-polished (EP) and centrifugal barrel polished (CBP) to mirror finish. An interesting effect of the grain size on the performances is found. Cavity results and samples characterization show that furnace contaminants cause poor cavity performance, and a practical solution is found to prevent surface contamination. Extraordinary values of <b>residual</b> <b>resistances</b> ~ 1 nOhm and below are then consistently achieved for the contamination-free cavities.

50|$|The Earth's nominal {{magnetic}} flux of 0.5 gauss (50 µT) translates to {{a magnetic field}} of 0.5 Oe (40 A/m) and would produce a <b>residual</b> surface <b>resistance</b> in a superconductor that is orders of magnitude greater than the BCS resistance, rendering the superconductor too lossy for practical use.

50|$|The {{conductivity}} {{of commercial}} conductors is often expressed {{relative to the}} International Annealed Copper Standard, according to which the purest copper wire available in 1914 measured around 100%. The purest modern copper wire is a better conductor, measuring over 103% on this scale. The gains are from two sources. First, modern copper is more pure. However, this avenue for improvement seems at an end. Making the copper purer still makes no significant improvement. Second, annealing and other processes have been improved. Annealing reduces the dislocations and other crystal defects which are sources of resistance. But the resulting wires are still polycrystalline. The grain boundaries and remaining crystal defects are responsible for some <b>residual</b> <b>resistance.</b> This can be quantified and better understood by examining single crystals.|$|E
30|$|Recently, Kamempour et al. (2012) {{presented}} an interesting data and interpretation on <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> factor. They {{observed that the}} <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> factor after AP flooding was much higher than that after polymer flooding. Their interpretation was that during post-AP brine flooding, the ionic strength was significantly reduced, and the polymer viscosity was restored. A question is, during post-polymer brine flooding, the ionic strength was also reduced, why was the <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> factor during post-polymer brine flooding not so high? Another question is, the <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> factor is caused by polymer adsorption. If the polymer adsorption during the AP flooding was lower than the polymer flooding, the <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> factor during post-AP brine flooding should be lower than that during post-polymer brine flooding. Kazempour et al.’s experimental observation needs to be confirmed by more experiments. If confirmed, a proper interpretation needs to be sought.

30|$|The {{efficiency}} of water flooding in heavy oil reservoirs would {{be improved by}} increasing the viscosity of the displacing phase, but the sweep efficiency is not of significance due to the low mobility of the vicious oil. On the basis of mobility control theory, increasing the <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> factor not only reduces the water-oil mobility ratio but also decreases the requirement for viscosity enhancement of the polymer solution. The <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> factor caused by hydrophobic associating polymer solution is higher than that caused by polyacrylamide solution in brine containing high concentrations of calcium and magnesium ions. The results of numerical simulations show that the polymer flooding efficiency improved by increasing the <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> factor is far better than that by only increasing solution viscosity. The recovery factor of heavy oil reservoirs (70 mPa·s) can be enhanced by hydrophobic associating polymer solution of high <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> factor (more than 3) and high effective viscosity (24 mPa·s). Therefore, increasing the <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> factor of the polymer solution not only decreases the requirement for the viscosity of polymer solution injected into heavy oil reservoirs but also is favorable to enhanced oil recovery during polymer flooding.|$|E

40|$|Since {{several years}} the {{development}} of seamless niobium cavity fabrication by hydro forming is being pursued at DESY. This technique offers the possibility of lower cost of fabrication and perhaps better rfperformance of the cavities because of the elimination of electron-beam welds, which in the standard fabrication technique have sometimes lead to inferior cavity performance due to defects. Several single cell 1300 MHz cavities have been formed from high purity seamless niobium tubes, which are under computer control expanded with internal pressure while simultaneously being swaged axially. The seamless tubes {{have been made by}} either back extrusion and flow forming or by spinning or deep drawing. Standard surface treatment techniques such as high temperature post purification, buffered chemical polishing(BCP), electropolishing (EP) and high pressure ultra pure water rinsing (HPR) have been applied to these cavities.

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview on the performance and vulnerability of structures in fire and earthquake. Two main scenarios of fire and earthquake are explored: (1) when a structure is damaged first by an earthquake and then exposed to a fire (fire following an earthquake) and (2) when a structure is damaged by a fire and therefore its residual seismic capacity needs to be assessed and inspected. Three case studies are presented: one for the fire following an earthquake scenario and two case studies for the second scenario. A large-scale, six-storey reinforced concrete building, previously tested on a shaking table, was selected and numerically evaluated for the scenario of the fire following an earthquake. The results of the analysis show that damage to the structural elements, during an earthquake, could result in degradation of the concrete mechanical properties and could increase heat transfer to the structural elements and therefore lower its <b>residual</b> fire <b>resistance.</b> Two reinforced concrete columns tested previously in fire were chosen and numerically assessed for their <b>residual</b> seismic <b>resistance.</b> Furthermore, a reinforced concrete column was experimentally tested in a fire and then tested under both axial and lateral load to evaluate and inspect its residual lateral load capacity.

30|$|Foam {{is widely}} used in the {{petroleum}} industry thanks to its unique properties and performance. Its application to water control in oil wells has received more and more attention. The stability of nitrogen foam was investigated in pressurized equipment and sand pack. The result indicated that with increasing pressure (0 – 2 MPa) the stability of foam in the pressurized equipment increased linearly. Increased nitrogen injection pressure caused better dispersion of nitrogen-foaming solution in porous media. The initial <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> factor to gas was an exponential function of injection pressure, but the <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> factor (to gas and liquid) decreased exponentially with time. The half-life of foam in porous media (expressed in <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> factor) was much longer than that in bulk phase (expressed in foam height). Pore model analysis indicated that good dispersion in porous media {{and the presence of}} thick liquid film during dispersion were the main reasons for high stability.

40|$|Heat {{treatment}} {{is critically important}} {{to the performance of}} Nb 3 Sn superconducting strands. For very large Nb 3 Sn magnet coils, such as the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) Central Solenoid (CS) coils, heat treatment carries risk of temperature and time excursion, which may result in performance degradation. Therefore, it is prudent to study the effect of possible excursion on Nb 3 Sn performance. In this study, Nb 3 Sn strands used for ITER CS coils are heat treated at different temperatures for different times. Their critical current, <b>residual</b> <b>resistance</b> ratio and hysteresis losses are measured. It is found that in the range we studied, critical current and hysteresis losses do not change significantly. <b>Residual</b> <b>resistance</b> ratio, however, decreases with increasing heat treatment temperature and time.

40|$|The working {{performance}} of a preformed pile may be significantly affected by the residual pile stress generated in the pile installation process. A field-test program is conducted in this study to investigate the load transfer behavior of two instrumented steel H-piles jacked into granular deposits during installation. Significant post-installation residual stresses {{are found to be}} locked in the test piles. The depth of neutral point for the residual shaft friction increases with increasing pile penetration but their ratios tend to be an invariable. Besides the well-known elasticity coefficient, the factors affecting the <b>residual</b> point <b>resistance</b> include the jacking force and the penetration rate. The average residual negative friction accumulates as the number of jacking strokes increases. Nevertheless, the unit residual negative friction at a given horizon shows a trend of degradation, which {{can be attributed to the}} presence of friction fatigue during pile installation. The residual pile stress is responsible for the variation in the stress state of the soils surrounding the pile shaft and beneath the pile base prior to loading service. This indicates that the pile-soil system will follow an unanticipated stress path toward axial loading failure. The data interpretation methods routinely adopted in the static and O-cell loading tests are going to be challenged in case that the influence of post-installation residual stress is involved. Also, the post-installation residual stress imposes positive effect on the uplift capacity of pile and increases the complexity of the plugging behavior of open-ended pipe piles.
