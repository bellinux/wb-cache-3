40|$|BACKGROUND HIV cohort collaborations, which pool {{data from}} diverse patient cohorts, have {{provided}} key insights into outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the extent of, and reasons for, between-cohort heterogeneity in rates of AIDS and mortality are unclear. METHODS We obtained data on adult HIV-positive patients who started ART from 1998 without a previous AIDS diagnosis from 17 cohorts in North America and Europe. Patients were followed up from 1 month to 2 years after starting ART. We examined between-cohort heterogeneity in crude and adjusted (age, sex, HIV transmission <b>risk,</b> <b>year,</b> CD 4 count and HIV- 1 RNA at start of ART) rates of AIDS and mortality using random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{consequences}} on impairment testing disclosures of auditor-pair choice made by French listed companies where two (joint) auditors {{are required by}} law. Managers are likely to manipulate impairment-testing disclosures since it relies on unverifiable fair value estimates (e. g., goodwill). From a simple game theory model, we demonstrate that a Big- 4 auditor paired with a non-Big 4 auditor increase auditors ’ incentives to force firms to disclose more because Big 4 auditor fully bears reputation costs. Using a disclosure score for firms composing the French SBF 120 index from 2006 to 2009, we provide evidence that combination of Big 4 / non-Big 4 auditors generate higher impairment-related disclosures levels whereas the other combinations, i. e. two Big 4 or two non-Big 4, tend to decrease the level of impairment-related disclosures. These empirical {{results are consistent with}} our model predictions and robust to various controls variables (e. g., size, <b>risk,</b> <b>year</b> and firm fixed effects).

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to estimate the risk of vertical HIV transmission and assess the associated factors and missed opportunities for prevention in a cohort of HIV+ pregnant women (1995 - 2001) treated in Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil, with follow-up of their children until 2005. Three data sources were compared: Information System on Reportable Diseases (SINAN), Information System on HIV+ Pregnant Women and Exposed Children (SISGHIV), and patient clinical charts. The study estimated the vertical transmission rates, factors associated with vertical transmission, and use of antiretroviral therapy. 276 HIV+ women were identified (322 pregnancies), and there were 70 HIV+ children. Overall risk of vertical HIV transmission was 27. 8 %. The vertical transmission rate was 40. 8 % in the group without prophylaxis and 1 % in the group with adequate prophylaxis, i. e., a 97. 5 % reduction in transmission <b>risk.</b> <b>Year</b> of delivery, consultation with a specialist, and no history of injecting drug use were factors associated with adequate use of antiretroviral therapy.

40|$|Background Chronic {{hepatitis}} C virus {{infection is}} prevalent and often causes hepatic fibrosis, which can progress to cirrhosis and cause liver cancer or liver failure. Study of fibrosis progression often relies on imputing {{the time of}} infection, often as the reported age of first injection drug use. We sought to examine the accuracy of such imputation and implications for modeling factors that influence progression rates. Methods We analyzed cross-sectional data on hepatitis C antibody status and reported risk factor histories from two large studies, the Women’s Interagency HIV Study and the Urban Health Study, using modern survival analysis methods for current status data to model past infection <b>risk</b> <b>year</b> by year. We compared fitted distributions of past infection risk to reported age of first injection drug use. Results Although injection drug use {{appeared to be a}} very strong risk factor, models for both studies showed that many subjects had considerable probability of having been infected substantially before or after their reported age of first injection drug use. Persons reporting younger age of first injection drug use {{were more likely to have}} been infected after, and persons reporting older age of first injection drug use were more likely to have been infected before. Conclusions In studies of fibrosis progression, modern methods such as multiple imputation should be used to account for the substantial uncertainty about when infection occurred. The models presented here can provide the inputs needed by such methods. Using reported age of first injection drug use as the time of infection in studies of fibrosis progression is likely to produce a spuriously strong association of younger age of infection with slower rate of progression...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the association between}} the degree of international involvement (DOI) and risk. Both systematic risk (measured by the market model beta) and total rishk (measured by variance of return) are analyzed. Betas of fully diversified foreign stock portfolios are shown to be lower than betas of domestic portfolios. Therefore, if the beta of a foreign investment by a U. S. firm {{is equal to the}} average beta of an investment in the foreign market, then overall firm beta will deverase as DOI increases (hypothesis). While total risk might be decreased due to the diversification provided by increasing DOI, currency, political, and other risks could cause total risk to increase. Briefly, {{the results of this study}} suggest that (1) systematic rish is negatively related to DOI even-after controlling for other factors known to be associated with systematic risk, (2) intertemporal changes in systematic risk are negatively related to intertemporal changes in DOI, and (3) in contrast to the results of previous research, DOI is not negatively related to total risk and, in fact, intertemporal changes in total firm risk are positively related to intertemporal changes in DOI. Our results suggest that increasing DOI decreases systematic rish but increases total <b>risk.</b> <b>Year</b> to year changes in both beta and variance of return appear to be related to year to year changes in DOI. While currency, political, and other risks of international operations increase total risk, these risks apparently can be diversified away resulting in a beta that behaves as a blending of its previous level and the beta of a fully diversified investment in the foreign market...|$|E

40|$|Background: HIV cohort collaborations, which pool {{data from}} diverse patient cohorts, have {{provided}} key insights into outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the extent of, and reasons for, between-cohort heterogeneity in rates of AIDS and mortality are unclear. Methods: We obtained data on adult HIV-positive patients who started ART from 1998 without a previous AIDS diagnosis from 17 cohorts in North America and Europe.

We examined between-cohort heterogeneity in crude and adjusted (age, sex, HIV transmission <b>risk,</b> <b>year,</b> CD 4 count and HIV- 1 RNA at start of ART) rates of AIDS and mortality using random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression. Results: During 61 520 person-years, 754 / 38 706 (1. 9 %) patients died and 1890 (4. 9 %) progressed to AIDS. Between-cohort variance in mortality rates was reduced from 0. 84 to 0. 24 (0. 73 to 0. 28 for AIDS rates) after adjustment for patient characteristics. Adjusted mortality rates were inversely associated with cohorts' estimated completeness of death ascertainment [excellent: 96 - 100 %, good: 90 - 95 %, average: 75 - 89 %; mortality rate ratio 0. 66 (95 % confidence interval 0. 46 - 0. 94) per category]. Mortality rate ratios comparing Europe with North America were 0. 42 (0. 31 - 0. 57) before and 0. 47 (0. 30 - 0. 73) {{after adjusting for}} completeness of ascertainment. Conclusions: Heterogeneity between settings in outcomes of HIV treatment has implications for collaborative analyses, policy and clinical care. Estimated mortality rates may require adjustment for completeness of ascertainment. Higher mortality rate in North American, compared with European, cohorts was not fully explained by completeness of ascertainment and may be because of the inclusion of more socially marginalized patients with higher mortality risk...|$|E
