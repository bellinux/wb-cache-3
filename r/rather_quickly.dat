5|$|Helene Bresslau Schweitzer {{was born}} to the Bresslau family on January 25, 1879 in Berlin. Her {{maternal}} family was of Jewish descent, but she was baptized into the Christian religion {{as a result of}} widespread anti-semitism. The Bresslaus moved to Alsace, France when she was eleven because of a new job opportunity for her father. Her father, Harry Bresslau, began working at the University of Strasbourg and eventually became chancellor. As a result of the move, Schweitzer adopted French, becoming fluent <b>rather</b> <b>quickly.</b>|$|E
5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not {{to go out on a}} second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined <b>rather</b> <b>quickly,</b> with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not to make it into Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E
5|$|The Przeworsk culture, {{named after}} a town in Lesser Poland, near which another burial ground was found, {{originated}} like the Oksywie culture around 250 BC, but lasted a long time. In its course it went through many changes, formed tribal and political structures, fought wars, also with the Romans, until in the 5th century AD its highly developed society of farmers, artisans, warriors and chiefs left for the temptations of the fallen empire lands (for many of them it happened possibly <b>rather</b> <b>quickly,</b> {{during the first half}} of that century).|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, {{allowing}} elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. However, because of the relatively small size of the bodies, the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation. In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from 4 Vesta suggested that it, and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed <b>rather</b> <b>quickly,</b> within ten million years of the Solar System's origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} <b>rather</b> <b>quickly</b> as {{a sequel to}} the Nintendo 64 title Hey You, Pikachu! and to promote the Nintendo e-Reader accessory, and uses a novel 3D texturing effect. It was first showcased at Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2003 and later through a month-long series of promotional events in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. It was released on July 18, 2003, in Japan, December 1 in North America, and April 2, 2004, in Europe. In Japan, the game sold 66,373 copies in its first year. It received mixed reviews, which generally criticized its low level of interactivity and repetitive sound effects, though its collecting aspects and visuals were somewhat better received.|$|E
5|$|By December 1409 Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas {{had agreed}} on a common strategy: Their armies would unite into a single massive force and march {{together}} towards Marienburg (Malbork), capital of the Teutonic Knights. The Knights, who took a defensive position, did not expect a joint attack and were preparing for a dual invasion—by the Poles along the Vistula River towards Danzig (Gdańsk) and the Lithuanians along the Neman River towards Ragnit (Neman). To counter this perceived threat, Ulrich von Jungingen concentrated his forces in Schwetz (Świecie), a central location from where troops could respond to an invasion from any direction <b>rather</b> <b>quickly.</b> Sizable garrisons were left in the eastern castles of Ragnit, Rhein (Ryn) near Lötzen (Giżycko), and Memel (Klaipėda). To keep their plans secret and mislead the knights, Władysław II Jagiełło and Vytautas organised several raids into border territories, thus forcing the knights to keep their troops in place.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the Kwan Um School of Zen, people became Dharma Teachers <b>rather</b> <b>quickly,</b> mostly out of need in order to run practice. The current requirement is that a person must take the five precepts after at least four days of retreat, or an agreed upon time by the guiding teacher of a Zen Center. To become a Dharma Teacher in Training will take the individual the minimum of two years after taking the five precepts. This also can only be approved of by the guiding teacher. The student will then take the ten precepts. To become a Dharma Teacher, one must complete a minimum of two years of training as a Dharma Teacher in Training that includes a course of study and certain amount of time attending retreats and serving certain practice roles. It takes a minimum of five years after becoming a Dharma Teacher to become a Senior Dharma Teacher and this must be approved by the guiding teacher. At this time, the person will take the sixteen precepts. Receiving inga (inka) only comes when a student has proven satisfactorily in further training sanctioned by a Zen Master and members of the school. Becoming a Zen Master will require the sanction of several Zen Masters in and outside the school.|$|E
5|$|In the {{dissipation}} stage, the thunderstorm {{is dominated}} by the downdraft. If atmospheric conditions do not support super cellular development, this stage occurs <b>rather</b> <b>quickly,</b> approximately 20–30 minutes into the life of the thunderstorm. The downdraft will push down out of the thunderstorm, hit the ground and spread out. This phenomenon is known as a downburst. The cool air carried to the ground by the downdraft cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, the updraft disappears and the thunderstorm will dissipate. Thunderstorms in an atmosphere with virtually no vertical wind shear weaken as soon as they send out an outflow boundary in all directions, which then quickly cuts off its inflow of relatively warm, moist air, and kills the thunderstorm's further growth. The downdraft hitting the ground creates an outflow boundary. This can cause downbursts, a potential hazardous condition for aircraft to fly through, as a substantial change in wind speed and direction occurs, resulting in a decrease of airspeed and the subsequent reduction in lift for the aircraft. The stronger the outflow boundary is, the stronger the resultant vertical wind shear becomes.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Nelson, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Bising, was the second {{tropical}} cyclone to strike the Philippines within a week in March 1982. Nelson originated from a tropical disturbance southeast of Guam towards the middle of March. Although the system was initially poorly organized, it developed <b>rather</b> <b>quickly,</b> and was upgraded into Tropical Storm Nelson on March19. It tracked westward, and fluctuated in intensity for several days. On March24, Typhoon Nelson intensified into a typhoon, and entered an episode of rapid intensification. On March25, Nelson reached its peak intensity of , but thereafter moved ashore on the Philippines, where the storm weakened significantly. On March27, the typhoon entered the South China Sea, and the next day, briefly re-intensified before resuming a weakening trend. Nelson dissipated on March31. Affecting the nation {{less than a week}} after Tropical Storm Mamie did, Nelson was responsible for additional flooding across much of the Philippines. Fifty-six people were killed due to the typhoon, eight of whom perished due to drownings. Over 1,200homes were destroyed. More than 165,000people fled to shelters, including 83,000that were displaced from their home. Thirty fishing boats and 23ferries were destroyed due to the system. Damage amounted to $17.2 million (1982 USD).|$|E

This was understandable given the initial Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact before Germany attacked the USSR, but forced the reevaluation of the European balance of power.|$|R
5|$|Vera only {{maintained}} {{peak intensity}} for roughly twelve hours, but still remained a powerful tropical cyclone. With very {{little change in}} strength, the typhoon tracked northwestward throughout September24. Due {{to the influence of}} a nearby high-pressure area, Vera began to gradually curve and rapidly accelerate northward towards Japan. At 0900UTC on September26, Vera made its first landfall on Honshu, just west of Shionomisaki. At the time, the typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 260km/h (160mph) and a barometric pressure of 920mbar (hPa; 27.17inHg). Vera traversed the Japanese island <b>rather</b> <b>quickly</b> at a speed 61km/h (38mph), and emerged into the Sea of Japan at 1530UTC that day. Despite its short stint over land, the terrain greatly weakened the tropical cyclone. Tracking into a westerly wind flow, Vera was forced eastward, resulting in a second landfall near Sakata, Honshu, with an intensity equivalent to that of a Category1 hurricane. Vera re-emerged into the North Pacific Ocean late on September26, having weakened due to advection of cold air in addition to continued land interaction. At 0600UTC on September27, the JTWC analyzed the typhoon to have weakened to tropical storm intensity. The warning center discontinued its periodic monitoring of the system, as Vera had begun to transition into an extratropical cyclone. Consequently, the JMA officially reclassified the system as an extratropical storm at 1200UTC that day. Vera's extratropical remnants continued to persist and track eastward for the next two days before the JMA last noted the storm at 1200UTC on September29.|$|E
