5|$|The tragedy Mirra by Vittorio Alfieri (written in 1786) is {{inspired}} by the story of Myrrha. In the play, Mirra {{falls in love with}} her father, Cinyras. Mirra is to be married to Prince Pyrrhus, but decides against it, and leaves him at the altar. In the ending, Mirra has a mental breakdown in front of her father who is infuriated because the prince has killed himself. Owning that she loves Cinyras, Mirra grabs his sword, while he <b>recoils</b> in horror, and kills herself.|$|E
5|$|Parsifal {{wonders if}} the Garden is a dream and asks {{how it is that}} Kundry knows his name. Kundry tells him she learned it from his mother (""), who had loved him and tried to shield him from his father's fate, the mother he had {{abandoned}} and who had finally died of grief. She reveals many parts of Parsifal's history to him and he is stricken with remorse, blaming himself for his mother's death. He thinks himself very stupid to have forgotten her. Kundry says this realization is a first sign of understanding and that, with a kiss, she can help him understand his mother's love. As they kiss Parsifal suddenly <b>recoils</b> in pain and cries out Amfortas' name: he feels the wounded king's pain burning in his own side and now understands Amfortas' passion during the Grail Ceremony (""). Filled with this compassion, Parsifal rejects Kundry's advances.|$|E

During the first years she worked together with chemist Otto Hahn and together with him discovered several new isotopes. In 1909 she presented two papers on beta-radiation. She also, together with Otto Hahn, discovered and developed a physical separation method known as radioactive recoil, in which a daughter nucleus is forcefully ejected from its matrix as it <b>recoils</b> {{at the moment of}} decay.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} of semi-automatic (or autoloading) firearms is usually {{what is known}} as a closed-bolt firing system. In a closed-bolt system, a round must first be chambered manually before the weapon can fire. When the trigger is pulled, only the hammer and firing pin move, striking and firing the cartridge. The bolt then <b>recoils</b> far enough rearward to extract and load a new cartridge from the magazine into the firearm's chamber, ready to fire again once the trigger is pulled.|$|E

In Yasna 9.8, Angra Mainyu creates Aži Dahaka, but the serpent <b>recoils</b> {{at the sight}} of Mithra's mace (Yasht 10.97, 10.134). In Yasht 13, the Fravashis defuse Angra Mainyu's plans to dry up the earth, and in Yasht 8.44 Angra Mainyu battles but cannot defeat Tishtrya and so prevent the rains. In Vendidad 19, Angra Mainyu urges Zoroaster to turn from the good religion by promising him sovereignty of the world. On being rejected, Angra Mainyu assails the prophet with legions of demons, but Zoroaster deflects them all. In Yasht 19.96, a verse that reflects a Gathic injunction, Angra Mainyu will be vanquished and Ahura Mazda will ultimately prevail.|$|E
25|$|Bubblegum bubbles {{are formed}} when {{the tension and}} {{elasticity}} of gum polymers acts against the constant and equally dispersed pressure of air being directed into the gum bolus. Bubble gum bubbles are circular because pressure from the focused air being directed into the bolus acts equally {{on all of the}} interior surfaces of the gum cud, uniformly pushing outward on all surfaces as the polymers extend. As the bubble expands, the polymers of the gum base stretch and the surface of the bubble begins to thin. When the force of the air being blown into the bubble exceeds the force that the polymers can withstand, the polymers overextend and the bubble pops. Due to the elastic attributes of chewing gum, the deflated bubble <b>recoils</b> and the wad of gum is ready to continue being chewed.|$|E

Winchester's reduced <b>recoil</b> X500SW ammunition propels a 350 gr g bullet at 1400 ft/s. Although such ammunition is considered low <b>recoiling,</b> due to having about one-third of the <b>recoil</b> energy of full-power [...]500 S&W ammunition, even these are a significant step up from most of the [...]44 Magnums, as they produce twice the <b>recoil</b> energy of a latter cartridge.|$|R

25|$|Direct {{detection}} experiments aim {{to observe}} low-energy <b>recoils</b> (typically a few keVs) of nuclei induced by interactions with particles of dark matter, which (in theory) are {{passing through the}} Earth. After such a recoil the nucleus will emit energy as e.g. scintillation light or phonons, which is then detected by sensitive apparatus. In order to do this effectively {{it is crucial to}} maintain a low background, and so such experiments operate deep underground to reduce the interference from cosmic rays. Examples of underground laboratories which house direct detection experiments include the Stawell mine, the Soudan mine, the SNOLAB underground laboratory at Sudbury, the Gran Sasso National Laboratory, the Canfranc Underground Laboratory, the Boulby Underground Laboratory, the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory and the China Jinping Underground Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Oxygenated blood {{enters the}} {{systemic}} circulation when leaving the left ventricle, through the aortic semilunar valve. The {{first part of}} the systemic circulation is the aorta, a massive and thick-walled artery. The aorta arches and gives branches supplying {{the upper part of the}} body after passing through the aortic opening of the diaphragm at the level of thoracic ten vertebra, it enters the abdomen. Later it descends down and supplies branches to abdomen, pelvis, perineum and the lower limbs. The walls of aorta are elastic. This elasticity helps to maintain the blood pressure throughout the body. When the aorta receives almost five litres of blood from the heart, it <b>recoils</b> and is responsible for pulsating blood pressure. Moreover, as aorta branches into smaller arteries, their elasticity goes on decreasing and their compliance goes on increasing.|$|E
25|$|Just as a gun <b>recoils</b> when {{a bullet}} is fired, {{conservation}} of momentum requires a nucleus (such as in a gas) to recoil during emission or absorption of a gamma ray. If a nucleus at rest emits a gamma ray, {{the energy of}} the gamma ray is slightly less than the natural energy of the transition, but in order for a nucleus at rest to absorb a gamma ray, the gamma ray's energy must be slightly greater than the natural energy, because in both cases energy is lost to recoil. This means that nuclear resonance (emission and absorption of the same gamma ray by identical nuclei) is unobservable with free nuclei, because the shift in energy is too great and the emission and absorption spectra have no significant overlap.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the long}} half-life, the {{technique}} is most applicable for dating minerals and rocks more than 100,000 years old. For shorter timescales, {{it is unlikely that}} enough argon-40 will have had time to accumulate in order to be accurately measurable. K–Ar dating was instrumental {{in the development of the}} geomagnetic polarity time scale. Although it finds the most utility in geological applications, it plays an important role in archaeology. One archeological application has been in bracketing the age of archeological deposits at Olduvai Gorge by dating lava flows above and below the deposits. It has also been indispensable in other early east African sites with a history of volcanic activity such as Hadar, Ethiopia. The K–Ar method continues to have utility in dating clay mineral diagenesis. Clay minerals are less than 2 micrometres thick and cannot easily be irradiated for Ar–Ar analysis because Ar <b>recoils</b> from the crystal lattice.|$|E
25|$|As the {{production}} of radioactive atoms by the ISOL technique depends on the free atom chemistry of the element to be studied, there are certain beams which cannot be produced by simple proton bombardment of thick actinide targets. Refractory metals such as tungsten and rhenium do not emerge from the target even at high temperatures due to their low vapour pressure. In order to produce these types of beams, a thin target is required. The Ion Guide Isotope Separator On Line (IGISOL) technique was developed in 1981 at the University of Jyväskylä cyclotron laboratory in Finland. In this technique, a thin uranium target is bombarded with protons and nuclear reaction products recoil out of the target in a charged state. The <b>recoils</b> are stopped in a gas cell and then exit through a small hole {{in the side of}} the cell where they are accelerated electrostatically and injected into a mass separator. This method of production and extraction takes place on a shorter timescale compared to the standard ISOL technique and isotopes with short half-lives (sub millisecond) can be studied using an IGISOL. An IGISOL has also been combined with a laser ion source at the Leuven Isotope Separator On Line (LISOL) in Belgium. Thin target sources generally provide significantly lower quantities of radioactive ions than thick target sources and this is their main drawback.|$|E
500|$|Liquid argon {{is used as}} {{the target}} for {{neutrino}} experiments and direct dark matter searches. The interaction between the hypothetical WIMPs and an argon nucleus produces scintillation light that is detected by photomultiplier tubes. Two-phase detectors containing argon gas are used to detect the ionized electrons produced during the WIMP–nucleus scattering. As with most other liquefied noble gases, argon has a high scintillation light yield (about 51 photons/keV), is transparent to its own scintillation light, and {{is relatively easy to}} purify. Compared to xenon, argon is cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile, which allows the separation of electronic <b>recoils</b> from nuclear <b>recoils.</b> [...] On the other hand, its intrinsic beta-ray background is larger due to [...] contamination, unless one uses argon from underground sources, which has much less [...] contamination. Most of the argon in the Earth’s atmosphere was produced by electron capture of long-lived [...] ( [...] + e− → [...] + ν) present in natural potassium within the Earth. [...] The [...] activity in the atmosphere is maintained by cosmogenic production through the knockout reaction (n,2n) and similar reactions. [...] The half-life of [...] is only 269years. [...] As a result, the underground Ar, shielded by rock and water, has much less [...] contamination. [...] Dark-matter detectors currently operating with liquid argon include DarkSide, WArP, ArDM, microCLEAN and DEAP. [...] Neutrino experiments include ICARUS and MicroBooNE, both of which use high-purity liquid argon in a time projection chamber for fine grained three-dimensional imaging of neutrino interactions.|$|E

50|$|Perception of <b>recoil</b> {{is related}} to the {{deceleration}} the body provides against a <b>recoiling</b> gun, deceleration being a force that slows the velocity of the <b>recoiling</b> mass. Force applied over a distance is energy. The force that the body feels, therefore, is dissipating the kinetic energy of the <b>recoiling</b> gun mass. A heavier gun, that is a gun with more mass, will manifest lower <b>recoil</b> kinetic energy, and, generally, result in a lessened perception of <b>recoil.</b> Therefore, although determining the <b>recoiling</b> energy that must be dissipated through a counter-recoiling force is arrived at by conservation of momentum, kinetic energy of <b>recoil</b> is what is actually being restrained and dissipated. The ballistics analyst discovers this <b>recoil</b> kinetic energy through analysis of projectile momentum.|$|R

500|$|Aeschines Socraticus and Antisthenes each named a Socratic {{dialogue}} after Aspasia (though neither survives {{except in}} fragments).

Aeschines presents Aspasia as a teacher and inspirer of excellence, connecting these virtues with her status as hetaira. According to Kahn, every single episode in Aeschines' Aspasia is not only fictitious but incredible.|$|E
500|$|The {{regiment}} {{was armed}} by December 15, 1861. Most of the regiment {{was equipped with}} horse pistols, a poor weaponry choice for a cavalry unit.

500|$|Wykes {{believes}} that, of the novel's three central characters, only Tony {{is representative}} of his real-life equivalent—Waugh in his pre-Catholic irreligious state. Brenda is portrayed in the novel as typical {{of many of the}} women in Waugh's early stories—well-bred, trivial and faithless—but Wykes argues that she is not a representation of Evelyn Gardner, [...] "neither in inward nor outward qualities". Nor, he asserts, is Beaver intended as an accurate portrayal of [...] Evelyn Gardner's lover, the [...] "dreadful nullity" [...] of Beaver being a form of literary revenge on the erudite Heygate. There is general agreement among commentators that other characters are drawn from life: Mr Todd is clearly based on the eccentric but rather less sinister Mr Christie; Dr Messinger, the incompetent explorer, reflects W. E. Roth, the curator of the Georgetown museum whom Waugh considered accompanying into the jungle, only to be dissuaded by reports of Roth's irresponsibility and disregard of danger. Thérèse de Vitré, the object of Tony's forlorn attempt at a shipboard romance, was named [...] "Bernadette" [...] in the original manuscript; the change was made as a reference to Waugh's platonic friend Teresa Jungman. Thérèse announces her destiny to marry a rich Catholic, and, in an echo of Jungman, <b>recoils</b> from Tony when she discovers that he still has a wife. The culmination of Tony's misfortunes, his enslavement to Mr Todd and Dickens, is foreshadowed in Waugh's life by his father's habit of reading his favourite literature aloud to his family, three or four evenings a week: [...] "...most of Shakespeare, most of Dickens, most of Tennyson... stepping about the room and portraying the characters... he held us enthralled".|$|E
