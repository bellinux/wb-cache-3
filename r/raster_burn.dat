30|$|We used FSim (Finney et al. 2011) to {{simulate}} the ignition and unsuppressed growth of wildfires starting in the designated RO fire start zone. FSim is a comprehensive, Monte Carlo-style fire occurrence, growth, and suppression simulation system that pairs a fire growth model (Finney 1998, 2002) and a model of ignition probability with simulated weather streams in order {{to simulate}} fire ignition and growth {{for tens of thousands}} of fire seasons. The results of these simulations are used to estimate annual burn probability (BP) and mean fireline intensity (MFI) in <b>raster</b> format. <b>Burn</b> probability is the annual probability of burning, and is estimated by dividing the number of simulated fires that burned each pixel by the total number of seasons. Mean fireline intensity is the arithmetic mean fireline intensity of the simulated wildfires that occurred at each pixel. FSim also produces a vector format geospatial layer consisting of the final perimeter of each simulated wildfire; start date, start location, duration, and final size are also saved to a file.|$|R
