40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to analyse the impact of parameters and drying method on the increase of the volume of dried apple slices and cubes during their rehydration. Ligol apples (cut into 3 and 10 mm slices and 10 mm cubes) were dried with the following meth-ods: natural convection (temperature of drying 60 ºC), forced convec-tion (a tunnel drier, parameters of drying air: 50, 60, 70 ºC and 0, 5, 2 ms- 1), fluid drying (60 ºC and 6 ms- 1). Dried fruit were rehydrated in the distilled water of 20 ºC temperature. Determination of volume was carried out with an uplift pressure method in petroleum ether. Tests proved the impact of ground dried particles and the impact of drying method on the increase of the volume of dried apples during their rehydration. The final volume of the <b>rehydrated</b> <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> increased along with the reduction of drying temperature, these differences in numerical values were low, but statistically significant.

Aim {{of this study is to}} compare the pectin methyl esterase (PME) activity of intermediate moisture figs which causes softening of the texture and to compare their microbial stability after 3 months storage period. For this purpose, <b>dried</b> figs were <b>rehydrated</b> in 30 and 80 ° C water until they reach 30 % moisture content. Rehydrated samples were stored for 3 months at + 4 °C. Results showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the control samples and the samples rehydrated at 80 °C according to the total viable counts. At the end of the storage period, results of residual PME activity in control samples was 24. 1 μmol COOH min- 1 g- 1, while it was found 17. 4 μmol COOH min- 1 g- 1 in samples rehydrated at 80 °C. As a result rehydration conducted at 80 °C provided 28 % reduction in PME activity compared to the control samples rehydrated at 30 °C, although it did not affect the microbial load significantly after storage. </span...|$|R
40|$|Chestnuts are {{characterized}} by limited shelf-life because of their high water activity and sugar content. For this reason, air-drying is typically performed to achieve physicochemical and microbiological stability of such fruits. However, undesired structural changes can occur during drying owing to the achievement of high processing temperature. These modifications can affect water permeability ruling {{out the possibility of}} uniformly <b>rehydrating</b> the <b>dried</b> <b>fruit.</b> This contribution provides an experimental and modeling study of the rehydration process of air-dried chestnuts. With the objective of characterizing the effect of the drying temperature on water permeability, chestnuts previously dried at 40, 60 and 80 °C are rehydrated by immersion in water at 90 °C and sorption curves are constructed. Under the explored processing conditions, a purely Fickian diffusion model fails to describe the evolution of the absorbed amount of water due to the occurrence of swelling and starch gelatinization. Therefore, a mathematical model is formulated simultaneously accounting for the effect of diffusion, swelling and starch gelatinization on the transport of water. Parametric estimation of the model parameters is performed, {{based on the results of}} rehydration tests, by nonlinear regression techniques. In this way, satisfactory agreement between model predictions and derived experimental data is achieved and valuable information about the influence of the drying pre-processing conditions on water transport are obtained. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|<b>Dried</b> <b>fruit</b> is {{fruit that}} is {{preserved}} {{by removing the}} original water content naturally, through sun drying or artificially, {{by the use of}} specialized dryers or dehydrators. <b>Dried</b> <b>fruit</b> has a long tradition of use dating back to the fourth millennium BC in Mesopotamia and is prized because of its sweet taste, nutritive value and long shelf life. Traditional <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> such as raisins, figs, dates, apricots and prunes have been a staple of Mediterranean diets for millennia. The Mediterranean region is very favourable for production of <b>dried</b> <b>fruits,</b> not only with its climatic conditions, but also its exceptional fertile lands. Additionally, proximity to trade routes historically has allowed Mediterranean countries more access to <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> than landlocked countries. Today, <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> consumption is widespread. Nearly half of the <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> sold throughout the world are raisins, followed by dates, prunes (dried plums), figs, apricots, peaches, apples and pears. Dates, prunes, apricots, figs and raisins are the major <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> produced in the Mediterranean area. <b>Dried</b> <b>fruits</b> are not perishable but can support mold growth, some of which can produce mycotoxins.

40|$|Abstract: The {{fruits of}} Lagenara scerara Standl. (Cucurbitaceae) {{are widely used}} for {{medicinal}} and nutritional purposes in Africa. The health promoting ability of the fruits {{might be related to}} antioxidant properties of its constituents. In this study the antioxidant effect of fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> of L. scerara was evaluated by comparing the 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1, 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging and reducing capacity of ethyl acetate and n-butanol extracts of fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>fruits.</b> The comparison was further emphasized by high performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC) analysis of the extracts so as to relate activities with their chemical profiles. Results indicated that ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the fresh fruits exhibited higher DPPH radical scavenging activity than other samples. At 0. 01 mg/ml the order of activity was: EA <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (50. 6 %) < Bt (n-butanol) fresh fruits (53. 3 %) < Bt (n-butanol) <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (64. 8 %) < EA fresh fruits (68. 6 %) < Gallic acid (81. 8 %). A slight change of activity was observed at 0. 1 mg/ml, where the order was; EA <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (70 %) < Bt <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> (71. 8 %) ≤ Bt fresh fruits (72 %) < EA fresh fruits (81. 6 %) < Gallic acid (88. 5 %). In the reducing capacity assay, Bt fresh fruits extract exhibited higher reducing power than all test samples. The HPTLC chemical profiles of both fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>fruit</b> extracts showed some slight differences. The slight differences in antioxidant activities were justified by the HPTLC chemical profiles of the fruits. Therefore, taking fresh or <b>dried</b> <b>fruits</b> of L. scerara may relatively give similar antioxidant effects.
