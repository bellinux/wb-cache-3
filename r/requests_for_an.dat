It painted a similar {{portrait}} of the real woman. According to Oppenheimer, Wintour not only declined his <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> interview but discouraged others from talking to him.|$|E
5|$|At Wardour Street {{station a}} branch {{was to leave}} the main route and head south-east, to connect to the DR's deep-level line east of its station at Charing Cross. Wardour Street station was planned to have {{platforms}} on both branches. The south-west extension to Walham Green was retained with minor alterations. The new route was to branch from the original route east of Brompton Road station, which was to have platforms on both routes. Stations were planned along Fulham Road at its junctions with College Street (now Elystan Street), Neville Street, Drayton Gardens, Redcliffe Gardens, Stamford Bridge and Maxwell Road. The route would interchange with the DR at Walham Green {{before coming to the}} surface and running parallel with the DR as far as Parsons Green, beyond which the line was to connect to the DR. The <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> extension of time and for the powers to build the DR deep-level line from South Kensington to Earl's Court were re-presented. As the B and the GN were now in common ownership, the bill also sought powers to enable the companies to merge and for the B to change its name.|$|E

25|$|Although Fahey's Maria Duce {{organisation}} {{was initially}} left {{to its own}} devices, Archbishop McQuaid grew less sympathetic {{to it in the}} latter half of the 1950s. He condemned the group for their heavy-handed reaction to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> interview from the anti-Catholic American writer Paul Blanshard (whom Bishop McQuaid felt should have been treated courteously despite disagreeing strongly with him). McQuaid went as far as to write to Fahey in 1954 stating that he opposed the latter's association of the name of the Blessed Virgin Mary with his organisation. Fahey died before any response could be made, and the group was disbanded the following year; McQuaid took on the group afterward.|$|E
25|$|In May 1568 Mary, Queen of Scots fled to England, {{and flung}} herself on Elizabeth's protection. She had found refuge in Carlisle Castle, and the {{delicate}} duty of {{taking charge of}} the fugitive was entrusted jointly to Knollys and to Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton. On 28 May Knollys arrived at the castle, and was admitted to Mary's presence. At his first interview he was conscious of Mary's powerful fascination. But to her <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> interview with Elizabeth, and for help to regain her throne, he returned the evasive answers which Elizabeth's advisers had suggested to him, and he frankly drew {{her attention to the}} suspicions in which Darnley's murder involved her.|$|E
500|$|General James Van Fleet of the Eighth United States Army {{had hoped}} that the change of commanders {{would allow him to}} reengage the Chinese in a major campaign, but in an effort to limit UN losses during the peace talks in Panmunjom, Clark {{repeatedly}} overruled Van Fleet's <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> authorized offensive into North Korean territory. In September 1952, Van Fleet submitted tentative offensive plans for Operation Showdown, a small-scale offensive drafted by the US IX Corps as a ridge-capturing operation. The goal of the submitted plans was to improve the defensive line of the US 7th Infantry Division north of Gimhwa near Triangle Hill, pushing the Chinese defensive line back [...]|$|E

500|$|During {{hearings}} on November 25, 2015, Judge Manuel J. Mendez disputed assertions by {{the services that}} a player's choice of athletes represents [...] "control or influence" [...] over the outcome, stating that players are ultimately [...] "relying on someone else's skill" [...] to determine an outcome. On December 11, 2015, the temporary injunction was granted, forbidding DraftKings and FanDuel from [...] "accepting entry fees, wagers or bets" [...] from residents of New York state. Mandez argued that [...] "the payment of an 'entry fee' as high as $10,600 on one or more contests daily could certainly be deemed risking 'something of value'." [...] He also ruled that the UIGEA [...] "has no corresponding authority under New York State law". However, Mandez granted a temporary stay following <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> appeal. On December 31, 2015—prior to an appeals court on whether they could continue to operate during the lawsuit, the Attorney General amended the lawsuit to demand that the two companies pay restitution—including the return of all money collected from customers in New York State. Schneiderman also acknowledged the services' deceptive advertising practices, such as [...] "convoluted" [...] first deposit bonuses.|$|E
500|$|At Kabul, {{the group}} was {{accommodated}} as state guests at the Emir's palace at Bagh-e Babur. Despite the comfort and the welcome, it was soon clear {{that they were all}} but confined. Armed guards were stationed around the palace, ostensibly for [...] "the group's own danger from British secret agents", and armed guides escorted them on their journeys. For nearly three weeks, Emir Habibullah, reportedly in his summer palace at Paghman, responded with only polite noncommittal replies to <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> audience. An astute politician, he was in no hurry to receive his guests; he used the time to find out {{as much as he could}} about the expedition members and liaised with British authorities at New Delhi. It was only after Niedermayer and von Hentig threatened to launch a hunger strike that meetings began. In the meantime, von Hentig learnt as much as he could about his eccentric host. Emir Habibullah was, by all measures, the lord of Afghanistan. He considered it his divine right to rule and the land his property. He owned the only newspaper, the only drug store, and all the automobiles in the country (all Rolls Royces).|$|E
500|$|Indians criticised their {{political}} leaders after the attacks, saying that their ineptness was partly responsible. The Times of India commented on its front page that [...] "Our politicians fiddle as innocents die." [...] Political reactions in Mumbai and India included {{a range of}} resignations and political changes, including the resignations of Minister for Home Affairs Shivraj Patil, Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukh and deputy chief minister R. R. Patil for controversial reactions to the attack including taking the former's son and Bollywood director Ram Gopal Verma to tour the damaged Taj Hotel and the latters remarks that the attacks were {{not a big deal}} in such a large city. Prominent Muslim personalities such as Bollywood actor Aamir Khan appealed to their community members in the country to observe Eid al-Adha as a day of mourning on 9 December. The business establishment also reacted, with changes to transport, and <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> increase in self-defence capabilities. The attacks also triggered a chain of citizens' movements across India such as the India Today Group's [...] "War Against Terror" [...] campaign. There were vigils held across all of India with candles and placards commemorating the victims of the attacks. The NSG commandos based in Delhi also met criticism for taking 10 hours to reach the 3 sites under attack.|$|E

The interview was broadcast on 6 September 2006 with her approval ORF did not pay for its interview, and said any proceeds from selling the interview to other channels would be forwarded to Kampusch. The interview was sold to more than 120 countries at a fee of 290 euros per minute. This money—estimates say some hundred thousand euros—will be donated to women in Africa and Mexico by Kampusch. Likewise she plans projects to help these women. Interest was enormous.|$|E
2500|$|Early 2017, Henry {{released}} a self-written and self-composed digital single titled [...] "Girlfriend." [...] The track was briefly revealed {{during his first}} appearance on MBC's [...] "I Live Alone," [...] then fondly titled as [...] "What should I do?". It gained attention for being an impromptu self-composed song. The track continues to receive favorable responses through Yoo Hee Yeol's Sketchbook appearance for its beautiful melody, and eccentric [...] "revolutionary" [...] lyrics. It leads to floods of <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> official release."Girlfriend" [...] was released on the 18th of March 2017 and was well received. The song peaks at #1 on multiple South Korean daily digital charts and #3 on Gaon Download Chart. The track is a soulful R piece that incorporates the sound of string and piano. The memorable lyrics delicately expressed the heartfelt sadness and longing for a dearly missed past lover, which correlates with the Korean title of the song [...] "그리워요" [...] (Missing you).|$|E
2500|$|Tinker {{announced}} an appeal before signing autographs for the cheering crowds. On December 22, the Houston Chronicle reported that Saldivar's lawyers were seeking a retrial, citing the prosecution's failure to notify them that a key witness {{had once been}} convicted of theft. Maria Norma Martinez, a motel maid, {{was said to be}} the only one to have seen the shooting. She claimed to have heard Saldivar call Selena a [...] "bitch." [...] The prosecution had used the remark to discredit the defense's claim that the shooting was accidental. Westergren denied the request and called the prosecutors' action [...] "somewhat problematic," [...] but decided an appeals court should decide on a retrial." [...] Both <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> appeal were denied on October 3,1998 and on August 19, 1999. On November 22, 1995, she arrived at the Gatesville Unit (now the Christina Crain Unit) in Gatesville, Texas, for processing. Saldívar is currently serving her sentence at the Mountain View Unit in Gatesville, operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. She will be eligible for parole on March 30, 2025. Because of multiple death threats from incarcerated Selena fans, Saldívar was placed in isolation and spends twenty- three hours a day alone in her [...] cell, apart from other inmates who may want to do her harm. Saldívar has asked the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals to accept a petition that challenges her conviction. She claims the petition was filed in 2000 with the 214th District Court, but was never sent to the higher court. Her request was received on March 31, 2008, the thirteenth anniversary of Selena's death.|$|E
