5000|$|Many {{electrical}} devices use direct current (DC) power, often provided by an AC (alternating current) to DC adapter, {{also known as}} a [...] "wall wart" [...] or [...] "power brick". The adapter typically supplies power to the device through a thin electrical cord which terminates in a coaxial power connector often referred to as a [...] "barrel plug" [...] (so-named because of its cylindrical shape). The polarity of the adapter cord and plug must match the polarity of the device, meaning that the positive contact of the plug must mate with the positive contact in the receptacle, and the negative plug contact must mate with the negative <b>receptacle</b> <b>contact.</b> Since there is no standardization of these plugs, a polarity symbol is printed on the case indicating which type of plug is needed.|$|E
40|$|Double-ended cap holds mating plugs and <b>receptacle,</b> {{preventing}} electrical <b>contact</b> {{between them}} {{when not in}} use. Cap maintains continuous electrical ground between plug and receptacle protecting against electromagnetic-interference pickup. Device is also useful for isolation of sensitive circuits from each other during storage, transit, or testing...|$|R
50|$|On {{some older}} female pin <b>receptacles,</b> the {{electrical}} <b>contacts</b> are not deeply recessed in the plug body and {{can easily be}} accidentally contacted resulting in an electric shock if the circuit is live. This was one advantage of the Edison outlet {{in that it was}} impossible to contact live parts unless something conductive was inserted into the slots. New connectors have the contacts deeper inside the body.|$|R
50|$|Plug and socket {{connectors}} {{are usually}} {{made up of}} a male plug (typically pin contacts) and a female <b>receptacle</b> (typically socket <b>contacts),</b> although hermaphroditic connectors exist, such as the original IBM token ring LAN connector. Plugs generally have one or more pins or prongs that are inserted into openings in the mating socket. The connection between the mating metal parts must be sufficiently tight to make a good electrical connection and complete the circuit. When working with multi-pin connectors, it is helpful to have a pinout diagram to identify the wire or circuit node connected to each pin.|$|R
