40|$|The {{exchange}} of health information between acute care providers (e. g. hospitals) and primary care providers (e. g. general practitioners) {{has traditionally been}} via hard copy discharge summaries. In recent years the advent of sophisticated information and communication technology has fuelled developments in electronic discharge <b>referral</b> <b>systems</b> (eDRS), which are credited with enabling more timely and accurate information exchange, enhancing patient care, and ultimately improving patient outcomes. The aim {{of this paper is}} to highlight key issues regarding the development and implementation of electronic discharge <b>referral</b> <b>systems.</b> A detailed literature review of information related to electronic discharge summaries was undertaken for publications between 1992 and 2006. While eDRS appear to be beneficial, further improvements are needed before systems are dependable. Through prospective enhancements and increased availability of eDRS internationally, electronic discharge <b>referral</b> <b>systems</b> have the potential to facilitate effective communication exchange across the primary-secondary care interface. 7 page(s...|$|R
25|$|The {{technology}} {{was first used}} by Channel 4 during a Test match between England and Pakistan on Lord's Cricket Ground, on 21 May 2001. It is used primarily {{by the majority of}} television networks to track the trajectory of balls in flight. In the winter season of 2008/2009 the ICC trialled a <b>referral</b> <b>system</b> where Hawk-Eye was used for referring decisions to the third umpire if a team disagreed with an LBW decision. The third umpire was able to look at what the ball actually did up to the point when it hit the batsman, but could not look at the predicted flight of the ball after it hit the batsman.|$|E
25|$|Over February and March 2010 England toured Bangladesh for two Tests {{and three}} ODIs. England won {{all of their}} matches against Bangladesh. Shakib was Bangladesh's leading wicket-taker in both the Test and ODI series (9 wickets in Tests and 5 in ODIs). In the second Test, Shakib scored 49 and 96, and took 4/124 from 66overs. Both Tests went to the final day and Shakib {{expressed}} the opinion that the experience had exhausted his side. The match was also a source of controversy after incorrect umpiring decisions {{on the third day}} went against Bangladesh, prompting Shakib to blame the lack of a <b>referral</b> <b>system</b> for some of the team's misfortune. In turn, Bangladesh toured England in May and July the same year. They again lost the Test series 2–0. Shakib finished as his team's leading wicket-taker with eight wickets, although he only scored 52runs. Before the ODI series, Bangladesh left England for Sri Lanka, which was hosting the 2010 Asia Cup in June. Bangladesh lost all three of their matches. With five wickets, Shakib was Bangladesh's lead wicket-taker with Shafiul Islam (5 each).|$|E
2500|$|The Decision Review System has {{generally}} received positive response from {{players and coaches}} since its launch, however {{there have been some}} criticisms as well. West Indies legend Joel Garner labelled the system a [...] "gimmick". Another West Indian Ramnaresh Sarwan said that he was not a supporter of the experimental <b>referral</b> <b>system.</b> Former umpire Dickie Bird also criticised the system, saying it undermines the authority of on-field umpires. The cricketing board of India has expressed a skeptical view on the adoption of the system if it is near perfect. Pakistani spinner Saeed Ajmal expressed dissatisfaction over the Decision Review System after a semi-final of the 2011 Cricket World Cup against India. He said that DRS showed the line of the ball deviating more than it actually did. Hawk-Eye officials admitted in December 2014 that their review technology made an error in a decision to give Pakistan opener Shan Masood out in the second Test against New Zealand in Dubai (17-21 November 2014). At a meeting held at the ICC office in Dubai two weeks later, Hawk-Eye is understood to have conceded to Pakistan captain Misbah-ul-Haq and team manager Moin Khan that the projection used by their technology for the Leg before wicket decision was incorrect. Also, a challenge can only be made by the captain within a 15-second window from when an initial decision is made, but it can be lengthened if no clear decision is made, especially they are assumed not out if there is no reaction by the umpire.|$|E

40|$|<b>Referral</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been}} {{proposed}} to assist people in finding potential experts in person-to-person social networks, in which each user is assigned a software agent and software agents help automate the process {{through a series of}} referrals. However, most of the existing <b>referral</b> <b>systems</b> have focused on the referral information generation, and simply consider referrals through path search in a static graph. An important question is how to efficiently search the social networks with the help of software agents, while agents only rely on their local knowledge. In this paper referral networks are proposed to model the social structure emerging among software agents. We study the referral networks empirically for the community of AI scientists (as defined in bibliographic data), and show how to control the searching process by adaptively choosing the referrals...|$|R
