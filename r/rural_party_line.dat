The circuits of subscribers requesting the feature often had to be moved from older switches that supported only pulse dialing to a newer crossbar, or later an electronic switching system, requiring the assignment of a new telephone number which was billed at a higher monthly rate. Community dial office subscribers would often find the service initially unavailable as these villages were served by a single unattended exchange, often step by step, with service from a foreign exchange impractically expensive. <b>Rural</b> <b>party</b> <b>line</b> service was typically based on mechanical switching equipment {{which could not be}} upgraded.|$|E
40|$|THE LETTERS-TO-THE-EDITOR columns {{found in}} most {{newspapers}} today refute the notion that "freedom of the press is guaranteed {{only to those who}} own one. " Letters columns provide an outlet for nearly two million expressions of opinion each year (Associated Press Man-aging Editors, 1976 : 218), combining what one midwestern editor calls "some of the elements of the town meeting, the <b>rural</b> <b>party</b> <b>line,</b> the loafers ' bench on the courthouse square, and the continuing ref-erendum " (Brown, 1976). Scholars are skeptical, however, about the representativeness of opinions expressed in letters columns. This skepticism is based largely on the perception that persons who write letters-to-the-editor are a tiny and atypical group of citizens. Some researchers also hypothesize that "letter opinion " may be biased by editorial policies which govern the selection of letters for publication. Newspapers, acting in a gatekeeping role, frequently elect to publish only a portion of the letters they receive. Abstract This paper compares letter opinion (opinions expressed in published letters-to-the-editor) with public opinion on ERA. Prior research has suggested that letter opinion is biased by atypical letter writers or by newspaper editorial policies which are used to select letters for publication. Drawing on a national sample of 92 daily newspapers, no substantial difference between letter opinion and public opinion on ERA is detected. Little support is found for the hypothesis that newspaper policies bias letter opinion...|$|E

The organisations of The <b>Rural</b> <b>Party</b> of Finland bankcrupted. In 1995 the members of The <b>Rural</b> <b>Party</b> of Finland established the True Finns.

5000|$|The {{predecessor}} of the Finns Party was the Finnish <b>Rural</b> <b>Party</b> (Suomen maaseudun puolue, SMP), {{founded by}} Agrarian League dissident Veikko Vennamo in 1959. Vennamo ran into serious disagreement with Arvo Korsimo, the Agrarian League's party secretary, and was {{excluded from the}} parliamentary group. As a result, Vennamo immediately started building his own organization and founded the Finnish <b>Rural</b> <b>Party.</b> Vennamo was a populist and became a critic of President Urho Kekkonen and of political corruption within the [...] "old parties", particularly the Centre Party (the renamed Agrarian League). The <b>Rural</b> <b>Party</b> achieved two major victories in the elections of 1970 and 1983, winning 18 and 17 seats respectively. In the 1970s, Vennamo's personalized leadership style alienated some in the party, {{which led to a}} split in the parliamentary group in 1972. After the <b>Rural</b> <b>Party's</b> new rise in 1983 under Vennamo's son Pekka, the party became a partner in two coalition governments. However, the party's support declined steadily in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In 1995, the party won only one seat in Finnish parliament and soon filed for bankruptcy.|$|R

40|$|The <b>rural</b> <b>parties</b> {{and socialist}} parties are {{animated}} by contradictory ideologies: projects commune versus class struggle. However {{the observation of}} their relations between the years 1920 to 1960 shows a strong similarity. The two political currents criticize the liberal economy and the <b>rural</b> <b>parties</b> are often partisan of an agricultural reform to which the socialists aspire, even if the final result is different. Last but not least, the parties which group together between the two wars in an agriculture International belong in majority to the camp of political democracy. Many of them are to become victims, {{as well as those}} of the left wing parties, of the authoritarian regimes which took over at that time in Europe. These similarities facilitated the constitution of alliances between <b>rural</b> <b>parties</b> and left wing parties in Scandinavia (where they tempted to put an end to the 1930 's crisis by conjugating a policy of protectionism and a rise in taxes) as well as in Czechoslovakia. With the exception of Scandinavia, the Nazi expansion put an end to these experiences. After the Second World War, the establishment of communism in central Europe either reduced the <b>rural</b> <b>parties</b> to the role of satellites or forced them into to exile. In Scandinavia, the alliances between the parties promoting agrarianism and the social democrats came to an end in the 1960 's and the <b>rural</b> <b>parties</b> became the right wing (centre) ...|$|R

The awareness of the different <b>Party</b> <b>Line</b> elements varied, and awareness was also affected by pilot workload. In addition, pilots were aware of some traffic information elements, but were reluctant to act on <b>Party</b> <b>Line</b> Information alone. Finally, the importance of <b>party</b> <b>line</b> information appears to be greatest for operations near or on the airport. This indicates that caution should be exercised when implementing datalink communications in tower and close-in terminal control sectors...|$|R
