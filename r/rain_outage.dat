40|$|Route {{diversity}} {{systems as}} available means {{to improve the}} <b>rain</b> <b>outage</b> performance are examined by comparison to tandem systems. A general and somewhat rigorous analysis {{for the evaluation of}} the joint probability on a pair of opposite hops has been performed, which is valid for any frequency. The total <b>rain</b> <b>outage</b> performance has been shown explicitly to be given approximately by the summation of joint probabilities on pair hops of the diversity system. A general and compact algorithm for the evaluation of the path length enlargement effect has been constructed which is valid for any frequency, above 10 GHz and single hop-length of the corresponding tandem system...|$|E

The Morita and Higuti (1978) model for the prediction of site diversity performance is modified to include the case of orbital diversity.

The technology for high power Ku Band (12 GHz) transponders has been demonstrated and examples are available of cost effective consumer-premises receiving systems. This paper describes the technology of satellite TV broadcasting systems, both ground and space, and indicates the salient cost and system parameter tradeoffs versus population served, e. g., cost versus G/T and number of ground terminals, <b>rain</b> fade <b>outage</b> effects and effect of number of satellite beams. Examples of designs, past and future will illustrate possibilities for high power, multiple shaped beam antennas, spacecraft high power generation and sundry problems...|$|R

40|$|The {{dominant}} Propagation factor {{affecting the}} reliability of millimeter-wave fixed cellular systems operating at frequencies above 20 GHz is rain attenuation. Cell-site diversity is an available method to reduce the <b>rain</b> <b>outage</b> time for these systems.

Numerical results are compared with available experimental data taken from Canada and the U. K. The agreement was found to be quite encouraging.

500|$|The {{precursor}} of Hurricane Barbara brought light to moderate rainfall to El Salvador. Many homes were damaged, roads were flooded, and several trees were downed. One fatality {{was reported in}} the country. Landslides caused by rainfall in Guatemala forced 30people to flee their homes.

Many shelters opened in Chiapas, Oaxaca and Guatemala while schools and ports were temporarily closed during the storm. Torrential <b>rains</b> and power <b>outages</b> were reported in the area. In the state of Chiapas alone, 2,000houses were damaged. About 57,000people were left homeless. Significant impact to agriculture was also reported, with [...] of crops destroyed.

40|$|The {{microwave}} attenuation due to rainfall {{in tropical}} regions {{has not been}} very widely studied yet. In Pakistan's tropical environment, line-of-sight microwave communication links were set up and have been operated for several years to study the microwave attenuation characteristics due to tropical rainfall. In this paper the experimental results are presented, including the cumulative distributions of microwave attenuation {{and the relationship between}} specific attenuation and rainfall rate. In addition, a <b>rain</b> <b>outage</b> prediction model is proposed which not only predicts microwave radio link performance but will also be useful in calculating the link degradations due to interference issues. The main focus of this research work has been done keeping in mind the wireless networks of Pakistan. The results show that the rainfall rate, the microwave propagation characteristics, and outage predictions in Pakistan differ from the International Radio Consultative Committee predictions and ITU recommendation P 530. 7 / 8, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The signal {{propagation}} at {{the frequencies}} above 10 GHz suffers from significant attenuation due to rain, which {{in case of}} point-to-multipoint systems {{is unlikely to be}} compensated for by available fade margin alone. For this reason and especially thanks to the non-uniform spatial distribution of the rain rate, it is suitable to utilize site diversity concept during planning of point-to-multipoint wireless systems. A database of radar data for numerous types of rain events has been established to enable system testing under different conditions. Outage improvement was studied using space-time simulations of point-to-multipoint systems in a specific area under a specific <b>rain</b> conditions. System <b>outage</b> improvement probability was derived as a straightforward function of the rain fade margin, angle separation and distances of main and diversity hubs. Some of the simulation results at 42 GHz and corresponding outage improvement probability using the site diversity are presented as well...|$|R
5000|$|There were no {{immediate}} reports of casualties or damage in northern Luzon. However, Luzon was pounded by Rita's violent 90 mph wind gusts and extremely torrential <b>rains.</b> Widespread power <b>outages</b> in Manila and Southern Luzon were reported when Rita passed 36 mi {{north of the}} city, cutting off satellite communications links. Red Cross and national disaster officials reported that more than 4,000 people were moved to safer ground and evacuation continued. A youth {{was reported to be}} electrocuted by a falling wire near the capital and a Luzon couple was seriously injured when a tree fell on their house. Power lines in many provinces were toppled. Some areas experienced wind gusts as much as 125 mph. Death toll from the storm was reported to have risen to more than 200 on October 31. A reported 354 other Filipinos were missing. The storm cut across rice-rich fields of the Central Luzon plains with 100 mph winds. More than 50,000 homes were destroyed and displaced 291,610 families, a total of 1,444,465 people. Damage to infrastructure and agricultural crops was placed at more than $100 million (1979 USD) and about 750,000 acres of rice was damaged. President Ferdinand E. Marcos declared 5 provinces calamity zones. He later ordered the suspension of the exporting of rice {{as a result of the}} extensive damage. Some areas experienced flooding that was waist-deep. It was reported that a Red Cross team sent to check reported that a dam had overflown and drowned 30 villagers outside the town of Norzagaray. In the Norzagaray area, 18 people were reported dead and 24 others missing. In the Angat area, where the Angat Dam is located, 6 people were dead and 20 were missing. U.S. Navy planes and helicopters saved 40 crewmen from a wrecked Moroccan ship that sunk in the South China Sea. The ship hit shoals 210 mi northwest of Manila. It had blown there by the typhoon's powerful winds and high seas. The flood waters caused 14,474 houses were partly or seriously damaged or by the extremely powerful wind gusts by the storm, in which Manila reported gusts of up to 93 mph. Super Typhoon Rita was the worst typhoon to strike the Philippines in 8 years since Super Typhoon Joan in 1970.|$|R
