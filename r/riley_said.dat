5|$|The {{belief that}} certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has {{historical}} antecedents, though cattle {{have never been}} so classified. Julius Caesar recorded a belief that a European elk (moose) had no knee joints and could not get up if it fell. Pliny said the same about the hind legs of an animal he called the achlis, which Pliny's 19th-century translators Bostock and <b>Riley</b> <b>said</b> was merely {{another name for the}} elk. They also noted that Pliny's belief about the jointless back legs of the achlis (elk) was false.|$|E
25|$|Harbaugh {{played his}} first game in Week 4 (September 24), a 20–12 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. On 8-for-14 passing, Harbaugh passed for 67 yards and an interception. He became starter in Week 5 (October 1). In the 57–31 loss to {{defending}} champion St. Louis Rams, Harbaugh was 27-for-40 for 348 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception and was sacked 3 times for 15 yards. Starting the Week 6 (October 8) game, a 21–7 loss the Denver Broncos, Harbaugh was 18-for-43 for 237 yards, 1 touchdown, and 3 interceptions. Two of Harbaugh's interceptions led to short Denver touchdowns, and Harbaugh threw his third interception on fourth-and-goal at Denver's 5-yard line. In Week 7 (October 15), an overtime 27–24 loss to the Buffalo Bills, Harbaugh's second interception of the game, by Henry Jones, was in overtime and paved way for Steve Christie's game-winning field goal. Following the game, coach Mike <b>Riley</b> <b>said</b> he regretted rotating between Harbaugh and Moses Moreno in the first half, as Moreno lost two fumbles, one of which Buffalo returned for a touchdown.|$|E
500|$|Based on {{comments}} {{he heard}} that his talents were [...] "deceptive", Lin stated in a 2013 60 Minutes interview {{that it was his}} [...] "gut feeling" [...] his ethnicity contributed to his being undrafted. NBA commissioner David Stern also believed Lin was not drafted due to discrimination. [...] "I don't know whether he was discriminated against because he was at Harvard. Or because he was Asian," [...] said Stern. Some fans and commentators wrote off his Warriors signing as a publicity stunt. Larry Riley, the team's general manager, denied catering to the Bay Area's large Asian population. He understood that some people would see it that way. [...] "We evaluated him throughout summer league," [...] <b>Riley</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "All that had to happen was for him to confirm what we already believed."

500|$|In September 2016, Bosh failed his {{physical}} exam with the Heat {{and was not}} cleared by the team to participate in training camp. Bosh was initially optimistic in {{a return to the}} Heat for the 2016–17 season, and the organization had become increasingly hopeful that he would be cleared for camp. That quickly changed, however, thanks to numerous setbacks accredited to continued blood clotting. On September 26, 2016, Heat president Pat <b>Riley</b> <b>said</b> that the team viewed Bosh's career with the team as over, and noted that the team was no longer working toward his return. On May 24, 2017, Bosh and the Heat reportedly reached a unique parting agreement in which he would leave the Heat without taking up their salary cap for the 2017–18 season. On June 2, 2017, the NBA ruled that Bosh's blood clotting issues were a career-ending illness, meaning the Miami Heat were able to remove his contract from their salary cap once they officially release him. And so it was, on July 4, 2017, the Heat announced that they had waived Bosh, ending a seven-year stint with the organization. Out of respect, Heat president Pat <b>Riley</b> <b>said</b> following Bosh's release, [...] "The number '1' will never be worn by another player and we can't wait to someday hang his jersey in the rafters".|$|E

The group recorded original tracks using Studer 24- and 48-track recorders and transferred {{them to a}} Sony digital recorder. For most songs, MIDI keyboards were played live into a sequencer and left unquantized, while vintage keyboards were recorded to analog tape. <b>Riley</b> <b>said</b> of the process in an interview for Keyboard magazine, [...] "even though we used a sequencer for some stuff, we'd still cut the song live from start to finish.

500|$|To promote Sons of Soul, Tony! Toni! Toné! {{embarked}} on a supporting tour that broadened their audience and concert repertoire. Aside from national venues, they promoted the album with concerts in Europe, Australia, and Japan. They also performed on television shows such as Saturday Night Live, Late Show with David Letterman, and The Apollo Theatre Hall of Fame ceremony. In November 1993, the group joined singer Janet Jackson's high-profile Janet. World Tour as a supporting act. However, after a few performances, the band left in January 1994, expressing frustration over their limited time onstage and Jackson's frequent show cancellations. <b>Riley</b> <b>said</b> they were also forced to alter their set list for Jackson's more mainstream, pop audience, while a tour staffer recalled the group [...] "left the tour with no advance notice" [...] and [...] "were extremely unprofessional." [...] They were replaced by Mint Condition as Jackson's opening act. Tony! Toni! Toné! subsequently went on hiatus, as each member pursued his own musical projects, producing and writing for other recording artists, before reuniting to record their 1996 album House of Music.|$|E
500|$|Due to its Japanese exclusivity, {{most of the}} English-language {{reviews for}} Seiken Densetsu 3 were {{published}} years after the initial release. One contemporary English-language review was in 1995 in GameFan, which covered import games, and rated the game highly. The Japanese Famitsu review also rated the game highly, though slightly lower than Secret of Mana. The Portuguese SuperGamePower magazine also gave it a positive contemporary review, noting it as having {{some of the best}} graphics of any game on the SNES. Critics have also rated the game highly in retrospective reviews, published mostly after the release of the fan translation patch in 2000. The graphics were praised; a review from 1UP.com called the game [...] "absolutely gorgeous", which they attributed to its position {{towards the end of the}} era of 2D SNES games, but before developers tried to start working with prerendered 3D graphics. A review by Chris Parsons of RPGamer agreed, terming the graphics [...] "awesome" [...] and positively comparing some of the effects to PlayStation RPGs, which the Cubed3 review by Adam Riley did as well. A preview by Next Generation written after the release of the game in Japan stated that the detailed graphics [...] "puts just about every other recent 32-bit RPG to shame", while the review by Corbie Dillard of Nintendo Life also noted the game as one of the best graphically on the SNES and called out the unique visual styles of each area in the game as of particular note. The game's music was also generally praised; Nintendo Lifes Dillard called it [...] "spectacular from start to finish", while Cubed3s <b>Riley</b> <b>said</b> it was [...] "one of the most sonically pleasing out of the whole SNES lifetime" [...] and RPGamers Parsons said that [...] "a wonderful job was done in the composition of the music". The Next Generation preview praised both the quality of the soundtrack and the musical continuity from the Secret of Mana soundtrack.|$|E
