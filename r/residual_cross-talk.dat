The method relies on a two-step adaptive filtering scheme derived from an established GSC structure. The filter updates are performed in the frequency domain to allow an effective DFT-bin-wise adaptation control. This new scheme is applicable to an arbitrary number of competing sources and experiments conducted for three and seven speech sources show that it allows {{to reduce the amount}} of undesired cross-talk components by about 10 dB, without noticeable distortion of the desired signal...|$|E

In this study, a piezoelectric inkjet printhead is considered, which is typically actuated by xed actuation pulses.

In the proposed method, the separated signals of FDICA are regarded as the input signals for TDICA, and we can remove the <b>residual</b> <b>cross-talk</b> components of FDICA by using TDICA. This can improve both learning stability in ICA and source-separation performance.

Two limitations of the present beam position monitors (BPMs) would be mitigated if the proposed approach is successful. The small but unavoidable cross-talk between signals from bunches traveling in opposite directions when using conventional BPMs will be reduced by adopting directional BPMs. Further improvements will be achieved by cancelling <b>residual</b> <b>cross-talk</b> using pairs of such BPMs. Appropriately delayed addition and integration of the signals will also provide pulses with relatively flat maxima that {{will be easier to}} digitize by relaxing the presently very stringent timing requirements...|$|E
40|$|ICASSP 2002 : IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, May 13 - 17, 2002, Orlando, Florida, US. We {{propose a}} new {{algorithm}} for blind source separation (BSS), in which frequency-domain independent component analysis (FDICA) and time-domain ICA (TDICA) are combined {{to achieve a}} superior source-separation performance under reverberant conditions. Generally speaking, the conventional TDICA fails to separate source signals under heavily reverberant conditions because of the low convergence in the iterative learning of the inverse of the mixing system. On the other hand, the separation performance of the conventional FDICA under reverberant conditions also degrades significantly because the independence assumption of narrowband signals collapses {{when the number of}} subbands increases. In the proposed method, the separated signals of FDICA are regarded as the input signals for TDICA, and we can remove the <b>residual</b> <b>cross-talk</b> components of FDICA by using TDICA. The experimental results under the reverberant condition reveal that the signal-separation performance of the proposed method is superior to that of the conventional ICA-based BSS methods...|$|E
40|$|Drop-on-Demand inkjet {{printing}} {{is considered one}} of the most promising printing technologies that offers several advantages including high speed, quiet operation and compatibility with a variety of substrates. That makes it an important manufacturing technology serving a wide variety of markets. Though the performance criteria imposed by today's applications are quite tight already, the future performance requirements will be even more challenging. However, the attainable performance is limited by two operational issues that are generally encountered, namely <b>residual</b> vibrations and <b>cross-talk.</b> This paper presents an approach based on a MIMO Model Predictive Control (MPC) with which the input waveform is designed to improve the printing quality of a piezoelectric inkjet printer.

40|$|Inkjet {{technology}} {{is an important}} key-technology from an industrial point of view. Its ability to deposit various types of materials on a substrate in certain patterns makes it a very versatile technology. Though the performance criteria imposed by today's applications are quite tight already, future performance requirements {{will be even more}} challenging. At the same time, several operational issues such as <b>residual</b> vibrations and <b>cross-talk</b> limit the attainable performance of inkjet printheads. Current research efforts focus mainly on a mechanical redesign of current printheads to overcome these operational issues. In this research, however, it has been proposed to fully exploit the mechatronic character of an inkjet printhead: the use of a systems and control approach has been investigated to break these boundaries. To that purpose, a model of an inkjet printhead based on bilaterally coupled multiports has been derived that provides an excellent starting point for the control purpose in mind. It has been shown that by the use of lifted Iterative Learning Control based on the obtained model, input wave forms can be designed that damp the residual vibrations after droplet ejection and minimize the effects of cross-talk. Consequently, the performance of inkjet printheads in terms of drop-consistency and attainable jetting frequencies is improved considerably. Also, based on the inkjet printhead model, a fundamental insight has been obtained that provides the indispensable foundation for a future mechatronic redesign of inkjet printheads.

40|$|Propagation {{of light}} beams through {{scattering}} or multimode systems {{may lead to}} the randomization of the spatial coherence of the light. Although information is not lost, its recovery requires a coherent interferometric reconstruction of the original signals, which have been scrambled into the modes of the scattering system. Here, we show that we can automatically unscramble optical beams that have been arbitrarily mixed in a multimode waveguide, undoing the scattering and mixing between the spatial modes through a mesh of silicon photonics tuneable beam splitters. Transparent light detectors integrated in a photonic chip are used to directly monitor the evolution of each mode along the mesh, allowing sequential tuning and adaptive individual feedback control of each beam splitter. The entire mesh self-configures automatically through a progressive tuning algorithm and resets itself after significantly perturbing the mixing, without turning off the beams. We demonstrate information recovery by the simultaneous unscrambling, sorting and tracking of four mixed modes, with <b>residual</b> <b>cross-talk</b> of - 20 dB between the beams. Circuit partitioning assisted by transparent detectors enables scalability to meshes with a higher port count and to a higher number of modes without a proportionate increase in the control complexity. The principle of self-configuring and self-resetting in optical systems should be applicable {{in a wide range of}} optical applications...|$|E
30|$|Supporting {{multiple}} active {{speakers in}} automotive hands-free or speech dialog applications {{is an interesting}} issue not least due to comfort reasons. Therefore, a multi-channel system for enhancement of speech signals captured by distributed distant microphones in a car environment is presented. Each of the potential speakers in the car has a dedicated directional microphone close to his position that captures the corresponding speech signal. The aim of the resulting overall system is twofold: On the one hand, a combination of an arbitrary pre-defined subset of speakers’ signals can be performed, e.g., to create an output signal in a hands-free telephone conference call for a far-end communication partner. On the other hand, annoying cross-talk components from interfering sound sources occurring in multiple different mixed output signals are to be eliminated, motivated {{by the possibility of}} other hands-free applications being active in parallel. The system includes several signal processing stages. A dedicated signal processing block for interfering speaker cancellation attenuates the cross-talk components of undesired speech. Further signal enhancement comprises the reduction of <b>residual</b> <b>cross-talk</b> and background noise. Subsequently, a dynamic signal combination stage merges the processed single-microphone signals to obtain appropriate mixed signals at the system output that may be passed to applications such as telephony or a speech dialog system. Based on signal power ratios between the particular microphone signals, an appropriate speaker activity detection and therewith a robust control mechanism of the whole system is presented. The proposed system may be dynamically configured and has been evaluated for a car setup with four speakers sitting in the car cabin disturbed in various noise conditions.|$|E
40|$|Polarimetric {{observations}} {{taken with}} ground- or space-based telescopes usually {{need to be}} corrected for changes of the polarization state induced in the optical path. In this paper, I present a new technique to determine the polarization properties of a telescope through observations of spectral lines that have no or negligible intrinsic linear polarization signals. For such spectral lines, any observed linear polarization must be induced by the telescope optics. I apply the technique to observations taken with the Spectropolarimeter for Infrared and Optical Regions (SPINOR) at the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) and demonstrate that I can retrieve the characteristic polarization properties of the DST at three selected wavelengths of 459, 526 and 615 nm. I {{determine the amount of}} cross-talk between the intensity, Stokes I, and the linear and circular polarization states, Stokes Q, U and V, and between Stokes V and Stokes Q and U in spectropolarimetric observations of active regions on the solar surface. I fit a set of parameters that describe the polarization properties of the DST to the observed cross-talk values. I compare my results to parameters that were derived using a conventional telescope calibration unit (TCU). The values for the ratio of reflectivities X = rs/rp and the retardance τ of the DST turret mirrors from the analysis of the cross-talk match those derived with the TCU within the error bars. I find a negligible contribution of retardance from the entrance and exit windows of the evacuated part of the DST. <b>Residual</b> <b>cross-talk</b> after applying a correction for the telescope polarization stays at a level of 3 - 10 % regardless of which parameter set is used, but with an rms fluctuation in the input data of already a few percent. The accuracy in the determination of the telescope properties is thus more limited by the quality of the input data than the method itself. It is possible to derive the parameters that describe the polarization properties of a telescope from observations of spectral lines without intrinsic linear polarization signal. Such spectral lines have a dense coverage (about every 50 nm) in the visible part of the spectrum (400 – 615 nm), but none were found at longer wavelengths. Using spectral lines without intrinsic linear polarization is a promising tool for the polarimetric calibration of current or future solar telescopes such as the Daniel K.
