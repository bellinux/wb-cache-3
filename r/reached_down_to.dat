Cleland <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> pick up a grenade that he believed had popped off his flak jacket. It exploded and the blast slammed him backward, shredding both his legs and one arm.|$|E
25|$|The Kolibri's tail was conventional, with a {{trapezoidal}} plan tailplane and elevators {{mounted on}} top of the fuselage and with a quadrantal fin and a rounded rudder that <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the keel. It had a very simple, fixed, tailskid undercarriage with the mainwheels on a short single axle held just below the fuselage underside, making the track narrow.|$|E
25|$|A welder, Ray Bradley {{was working}} with a crew of men {{installing}} an expansion joint on July 31, 1950. That day, it was raining heavily and Ray had <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> grab the led direct current wire for a welding machine. According to the Pierce County Coroner's report, he suffered a heart attack, although bridgemen believed his death {{was the result of}} electrocution.|$|E

25|$|Firetrucks were {{positioned}} along De Waal Drive and the M3, {{as well as}} near UCT. The fire <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the M3's hospital bend, opposite Groote Schuur Hospital, thus causing traffic {{officials to}} close the road and re-route all incoming traffic onto Mowbray Main Road. Other roads which were closed include Tafelberg Road towards the Lower Cable Car Station and Signal Hill Road.|$|E
25|$|Then further back, {{higher than}} the candelabrum, and much {{higher than the}} altar, rose the Moloch, all of iron, and with gaping {{apertures}} in his human breast. His outspread wings were stretched upon the wall, his tapering hands <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the ground; three black stones bordered by yellow circles represented three eyeballs on his brow, and his bull's head was raised with a terrible effort as if in order to bellow.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} at least two glacial periods {{in the history of the}} {{mountains}} and they were glaciated as little as 2,000 years ago. During the Last ice age, the Bale Mountains were one of the most extensively glaciated areas in present day Ethiopia, with a total area of ice in Bale of approximately 180km2. There was a 30km2 ice cap around the peak of Tulu Dimtu (the second highest mountain in Ethiopia) on the Sanetti Plateau and individual glaciers of considerable thickness <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 3,200 meters. As a consequence, the landscape as we see it today is the lava outpourings much modified by over 20 million years of erosion by water, wind and ice.|$|E

25|$|In 2001 X-rays and a CT scan {{revealed}} that Ötzi had an arrowhead lodged {{in his left}} shoulder when he died, and a matching small tear on his coat. The discovery of the arrowhead prompted researchers to theorize Ötzi died of blood loss from the wound, which {{would probably have been}} fatal even if modern medical techniques had been available. Further research found that the arrow's shaft had been removed before death, and close examination of the body found bruises and cuts to the hands, wrists and chest and cerebral trauma indicative of a blow to the head. One of the cuts was to the base of his thumb that <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the bone but had no time to heal before his death. Currently, it is believed that Ötzi bled to death after the arrow shattered the scapula and damaged nerves and blood vessels before lodging near the lung.|$|E
25|$|The early uniforms worn by Mongolian {{troops were}} their {{civilian}} clothing. Typical {{it consisted of}} a long blue padded cotton tunic that was worn which <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the ankles along with an ornage sash around the waist. Headgear was either a lambs' wool hat or a colored turban wrapped around the head. The color of the turban varied with each Mongol banner clan having a distinctive one. In addition they wore a leather bandolier for cartridges which was slung over the left shoulder. Some soldiers were dressed in loose fitting cotton jacket and trousers along with a peak cap. In 1936 a new uniform was in use, modeled on the Nationalist Chinese uniform. It included a loose-fitting grey jacket and grey cotton trousers. A peaked grey cotton peaked cap was worn along with it (similar in appearance to those worn by the Russian Imperial Army during World War I). Other uniforms they used included the regular Japanese Army uniform but with Inner Mongolian insignia.|$|E

500|$|The {{existence}} of a cirque on the northwestern slope has been postulated. It was once believed that Llullaillaco had experienced three large glaciations, but the [...] "moraines" [...] are actually mudflow deposits. However, during the Pleistocene glaciers <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> [...] altitude on the northwestern slope. Lava flows have overrun some of the glaciated surfaces {{and it is possible}} that lava flows induced the melting of glaciers. A number of glacial landforms elsewhere were destroyed by mudflows during the time of Llullaillaco's last activity. Llullaillaco may not have been glaciated at all during the Pleistocene.|$|E
500|$|The {{hall and}} solar block are {{adjacent}} to the south tower, and were designed to be symmetrical when seen from the courtyard, although {{the addition of the}} additional stone buttresses in the 19th century has altered this appearance. The hall is [...] long and [...] wide, with has three large, wooden 13th-century arches supporting the roof, unusually, given its size, using lateral wooden collars, but no vertical king-posts. The roof's cruck joists now rest on 19th-century stone supports, but would have originally <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the ground. The roof is considered by the historian Henry Summerson to be a [...] "rare survival for the period". In the medieval period a wooden screen would have cut off the north end, providing a more secluded dining area.|$|E
500|$|According {{to initial}} police statements, {{at this point}} {{one or more of}} the {{suspects}} began firing with semiautomatic handguns and Trooper Foerster fired four times before falling mortally wounded. At Acoli's trial, Harper testified that the gunfight started [...] "seconds" [...] after Foerster arrived at the scene. At this trial, Harper said that Foerster reached into the vehicle, pulled out and held up a semi-automatic pistol and ammunition magazine, and said [...] "Jim, look what I found", while facing Harper at the rear of the vehicle. At this point, Assata Shakur and Zayd Shakur were ordered to put their hands on their laps and not to move; Harper said that Assata Shakur then <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the right of her right leg, pulled out a pistol, and shot him in the shoulder, after which he retreated to behind his vehicle. Questioned by prosecutor C. Judson Hamlin, Harper said he saw Foerster shot just as Assata Shakur was felled by bullets from Harper's gun. Harper testified that Acoli shot Foerster with a [...]38 caliber semiautomatic pistol and then used Foerster's own gun to [...] "execute him". According to the testimony of State Police investigators, two jammed semi-automatic pistols were discovered near Foerster's body.|$|E

[...] Kirtles also had long, fitted sleeves that sometimes <b>reached</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> cover the knuckles.|$|E
2500|$|Its tail was conventional, {{with wooden}} {{structures}} and tapered, round-tipped surfaces. The elevators and the leading {{edges of the}} rudder (there was no fin) were ply-covered boxes, with silk elsewhere.
