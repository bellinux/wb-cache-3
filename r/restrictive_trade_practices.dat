500|$|Five judges (Chief Justice Gleeson and Justices Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan) {{joined in}} the leading {{majority}} judgment allowing the ACCC's appeal. The joint judgment reasoned that Parliament could not have intended for corporations that {{do business with the}} government to be exempt from the <b>restrictive</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> provisions in PartIV of the TPA in respect of that business. Emphasising the overall purpose of the TPA, the judges reasoned that the purpose would not be fulfilled if Baxter could claim derivative immunity. In response to the concern that one party to a transaction (the government) would be immune from the TPA while the other party would be bound by it, the joint judgment reasoned there was [...] "nothing unusual" [...] about such an outcome.|$|E

Certain of the important business operations were placed under the monopoly of the Government through Public Sector Undertakings, while other businesses were allowed to be operated by the private players. The Monopolies <b>Restrictive</b> and <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act, 1969 (MRTP Act) was used for combating monopolies. However, post-liberalisation era, a broader and progressive legislation that aimed at promoting market competition was felt necessary.

50|$|The Fiji Commerce Commission (FCC) is a {{statutory}} organisation {{responsible for}} fair trade, competition (economics) and consumer protection regulation in the Fiji Islands.

It was modelled on the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). In 2010 the Fiji government passed the Commerce Commission Act 2010 which saw the Commission taken on extra responsibilities that notably included price control. Two of Fiji's regulatory agencies, the Department of Fair Trading & Consumer Affairs (DFTCA) and the Prices & Incomes Board (PIB) ceased to exist as separate entities following this new law. The functions, operations and staff of the two agencies are now merged into the Commerce Commission.|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Dispute {{settlement}} in the World Trade Organization (WTO) is carried out under the WTO Understanding on Rules and Procedures Governing the Settlement of Disputes (DSU). In effect since January 1995, the DSU provides for consultations between disputing parties, panels and appeals, and possible retaliation if a defending party fails {{to comply with a}} WTO decision by an established deadline. Automatic establishment of panels, adoption of panel and appellate reports, and authorization of requests to retaliate, along with deadlines and improved multilateral oversight of compliance, are aimed at producing a more expeditious and effective system than had existed under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). To date, 398 complaints have been filed, approximately half involving the United States as complainant or defendant. Expressing dissatisfaction with WTO dispute settlement results in the trade remedy area, Congress, in the Trade Act of 2002, directed the executive branch to address dispute {{settlement in}} WTO negotiations. WTO Members have been negotiating DSU revisions in the currently stalled Doha Development Round of trade negotiations but no final agreement on the DSU has been reached. Use of the DSU has revealed procedural gaps, particularly affecting the compliance phase of a dispute. These include a failure to coordinate procedures for requesting retaliation with procedures for tasking a WTO panel with determining whether a defending Member has complied in a case and the absence of a procedure for withdrawing trade sanctions imposed by a complaining Member where the defending Member believes it has fulfilled its WTO obligations. As a result, disputing Members have entered into bilateral agreements permitting retaliation and compliance panel processes to progress on an agreed schedule and have initiated new dispute proceedings aimed at removing retaliatory measures. Where a U. S. law or regulation is at issue in a WTO case, the adoption by the WTO of a panel or Appellate Body report finding that the measure violates a WTO agreement does not give the report direct legal effect in this country; thus federal law is not affected until Congress or the executive branch, as the case may be, takes action to remove the offending measure. Where a <b>restrictive</b> foreign <b>trade</b> <b>practice</b> is at issue, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 provides a mechanism by which the United States Trade Representative (USTR) may challenge the measure in a WTO dispute settlement proceeding and authorizes the USTR to take retaliatory action if the defending Member has not complied with the resulting WTO decision. Although Section 301 was challenged in the WTO on the ground that it requires the USTR to act unilaterally in WTO-related trade disputes in violation of DSU provisions requiring resort to multilateral WTO dispute settlement, the United States was ultimately found not to be in violation of its DSU obligations. H. R. 496 (Rangel) would create an Office of the Congressional Trade Enforcer (CTE) that would, inter alia, investigate <b>restrictive</b> foreign <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> in light of WTO obligations and call on the USTR to initiate WTO dispute proceedings where the CTE finds that WTO violations have occurred; express congressional dissatisfaction with WTO dispute settlement decisions finding that the U. S. practice of “zeroing” (i. e., disregarding non-dumped sales in the calculation of dumping margins) violates the WTO Antidumping Agreement and with decisions of the WTO Appellate Body generally; and place restrictions on the Department of Commerce in implementing the revised antidumping methodology that it adopted in 2007 in response to the WTO “zeroing” decisions. S. 363 (Snowe), would give the U. S. Court of International Trade exclusive jurisdiction to review de novo certain USTR determinations under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, which may in some cases involve the initiation and conduct of WTO disputes; the bill would also amend various Section 301 authorities themselves...|$|R
2500|$|The English {{doctrine}} of restraint of trade was {{the catalyst for}} {{much of what is}} now called [...] "competition laws" [...] (or sometimes [...] "antitrust"). These laws are a way of restraining those who would restrain [...] "free competition" [...] in the market economy, through monopolising production, setting up cartels, imposing unfair trading conditions, prices and so on. The English approach has traditionally been very flexible and liberal in its scope, but draconian when it did deem certain behaviour to be in restraint of trade. Many of these laws around {{the end of the nineteenth}} century were focused on the emasculation of trade unionism, until the reforming government of 1906 and the Trade Disputes Act 1906. Aside from the common law, legislation was introduced shortly after the second world war to foot policy on a statutory basis, the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Act 1948, followed later by the <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act 1956 and the Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965.|$|E

40|$|Excerpt] President Barack Obama’s Administration {{has sought}} to build upon the deepened U. S. {{engagement}} with India begun by President Bill Clinton in 2000 and expanded upon {{during much of the}} past decade under President G. W. Bush. This “U. S. -India 3. 0 ” diplomacy was most recently on display in July 2011, when the second U. S. -India Strategic Dialogue session saw a large delegation of senior U. S. officials visit New Delhi to discuss a broad range of global and bilateral issues. Many analysts view the U. S. -India relationship as being among the world’s most important in coming decades and see potentially large benefits to be accrued through engagement on many convergent interests. Bilateral initiatives are underway in all areas, although independent analysts in both countries worry that the partnership has lost momentum in recent years. Outstanding areas of bilateral friction include obstacles to bilateral trade and investment, including in the high-technology sector; outsourcing; the status of conflict in Afghanistan; climate change; and stalled efforts to initiate civil nuclear cooperation. India is the world’s most populous democracy and remains firmly committed to representative government and rule of law. Its left-leaning Congress Party-led ruling national coalition has been in power for more than seven years under the leadership of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, an Oxford-trained economist. New Delhi’s engagement with regional and other states is extensive and reflects its rising geopolitical status. The national economy has been growing rapidly—India’s is projected to be the world’s third-largest economy in the foreseeable future—yet poor infrastructure, booming energy demand, and <b>restrictive</b> <b>trade</b> and investment <b>practices</b> are seen to hamper full economic potential. Despite the growth of a large urban middle-class, India’s remains a largely rural and agriculture-based society, and is home to some 500 - 600 million people living in poverty.
