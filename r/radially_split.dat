40|$|Tutorialpg. 129 What I {{decided to}} {{accomplish}} in this tutorial is to examine {{a few of the}} myths that pertain to centrifugal pump construction and to try to shed some light on their origins as well as on their validity. More specifically, I have chosen six different details of construction wherein major differences in concept have evolved over the years, namely: *The use of double vs single wearing rings * An improved wearing ring built on a false premise * Extra deep stuffing boxes * Axially vs <b>radially</b> <b>split</b> inner casings of double-casing multistage pumps * The balancing of the axial thrust of multistage pumps * Differences of philosophy in the rotor design of multistage pumps...|$|E
40|$|An oak timber was {{discovered}} in 2013 within intertidal peats at the Bay of Ireland, Stenness, Orkney, representing a unique archaeological find. Subsequent excavation and rescue of the timber took place in 2014 to investigate its stratigraphical relationship before further eroding. Dendrochronological and morphological study identified the timber as a possible <b>radially</b> <b>split</b> log, c. 150 years of age when felled. No dendrochronological match was possible, and a wiggle-match date obtained provided a Later Mesolithic felling date of 4410 – 4325 cal BC. This timber is {{the first and only}} evidence so far for the use of oak in Mesolithic Orkney. The timber is significant palaeoecologically, suggesting oak may have been indigenous to Orkney. This adds to a growing argument for the existence of areas of “true woodland”. Pollen evidence shows the timber was deposited within reedswamp, fringed by willow-birch carr-woodland, with oak unlikely to have been growing in the immediate location. High microscopic and macroscopic charcoal values indicate Later Mesolithic communities' exerted influence on this wetland using burning as a tool for landscape modification. It is unknown what the timber represents; it may have been for construction purposes or as a marker/possible landing place showing the path to the Loch of Stenness...|$|E
50|$|The tiny fruitbodies, {{measuring}} 1.5-3.5 cm tall by 0.5-2.5 (-3.5) cm across, {{produce a}} deeply funnel-shaped cap, often undulating or <b>splitting</b> <b>radially</b> {{to acquire a}} flower- or coral-like shape. It is so far only known from Apulia in southern Italy and the island of Cyprus.|$|R
5000|$|Cleaving is done {{by driving}} a wedge between the fibres of a log, so as to split fibres apart along their weakest path. This work may appear strenuous, but is far less effort than rip sawing by hand. It is first done <b>radially,</b> to <b>split</b> the log into wedged segments. Timbers with {{medullary}} rays, such as oak, {{may be hard to}} split through these radial rays and so careful alignment is made to split between them. Segments are halved symmetrically at each step, as this encourages them to split more evenly than attempting to cleave off thin sheets repeatedly from one end.|$|R
50|$|Unopened fruit {{bodies of}} Zeus olympius are {{circular}} blackened crusts that occur below the bark. When ripe, the fruit body expands, {{breaking through the}} bark, and the crust <b>splits</b> <b>radially</b> into small black teeth. This exposes the fertile layer (hymenium), which is an orange- to golden-coloured angular or circular disc ranging from 0.2-5 mm in diameter.|$|R
40|$|Quickly {{attaching}} joint used in {{variety of}} truss structures. Split ring made {{in one piece}} and <b>split</b> <b>radially</b> after final machining. Mating tapers on split ring and endbells small: approximately 7 degrees. Tapers of this range permit high internal preloads to be obtained, yet parts easily separated when collar released. Results from tests on developmental model indicate load-displacement response linear and substantial preloading accomplished. Quickly-erecting truss structures have variety of applications, from Earth to space-station keel beams, antenna masts, and large platforms...|$|R
40|$|Computations on an 80 -coefficient {{model of}} the earth's field {{illustrate}} the 'topography' of the magnetic equatorial surface and the geometry of the drift shells of geomagnetically trapped particles. Individual terms in the spherical harmonic expansion of the geomagnetic scalar potential V(r, theta, phi) are either even or odd in cos theta, where theta = 90 deg denotes the dipole equator. Terms that are even in cos theta tend to 'warp' the equatorial surface, but do not (in first order) distort particle drift shells <b>radially</b> nor <b>split</b> the drift shells of particles having different equatorial pitch angles. Azimuthally asymmetric terms that are odd in cos theta do cause shell splitting in first order. Shell splitting at large L values (neglecting deformation of the earth's field by the solar wind) {{is found to be}} dominated by the geomagnetic octupole. At L approximately equal to 1, shell splitting is strongly enhanced by the South American and South African anomalies. When combined with pitch angle diffusion caused by atmospheric scattering, these results may be able to account for anomalous radial diffusion of inner zone electrons...|$|R
5|$|Agaricus deserticola, {{commonly}} known as the gasteroid agaricus, is a species of fungus in the family Agaricaceae. Found only in southwestern and western North America, A.deserticola is adapted for growth in dry or semi-arid habitats. The fruit bodies are secotioid, meaning the spores are not forcibly discharged, and the cap does not fully expand. Unlike other Agaricus species, A.deserticola does not develop true gills, but rather a convoluted and networked system of spore-producing tissue called a gleba. When the partial veil breaks or pulls away from the stem or the cap <b>splits</b> <b>radially,</b> the blackish-brown gleba is exposed, which allows the spores to be dispersed.|$|R
500|$|The cap of M.galericulata {{is roughly}} conical when young, and {{eventually}} becomes broadly bell-shaped {{or with a}} broad umbo that can reach diameters of [...] The cap margin is initially somewhat curved inward, but soon evens out or even becomes uplifted, and often <b>splits</b> <b>radially</b> in age. The surface has radial grooves that extend nearly to the center, and feels greasy but not sticky. The color is somewhat buff-brown on the margin, and fades gradually to pale dirty tan to dirty cinnamon-brown. The flesh is thick {{in the center of}} the cap and tapers evenly to the margin, and is watery gray, with a cartilage-like texture. The odor and taste are mildly to strongly farinaceous (similar to the smell of freshly ground flour), to radish-like.|$|R
50|$|It grows as a woody shrub {{or small}} tree to 8 m, {{although}} occasionally reaching 30 m, with flaky brownish-grey bark. It has simple alternate-arranged elliptical leaves 3 - 10 cm {{in length and}} 1.5 - 4 cm wide; the species may be partly deciduous in winter. Flowering may occur {{at any time of}} year; the cheese tree has both single female and male flowers, which are found in groups of three. Both sexes are green-yellow, with the male flowers about 0.7 cm and the female 0.5 cm in diameter. The most notable feature are the small pumpkin-shaped fruit, which are green at first before turning shades of white and pink. Divided into segments <b>radially,</b> they eventually <b>split</b> open to reveal bright red 0.5 cm seeds from November to April.|$|R
500|$|The ectomycorrhizal {{structures}} of H.peckii are among {{a few in}} the Bankeraceae that have been studied in detail. They are characterized by a plectenchymatous mantle—a layer of tissue made of hyphae tightly arranged in a parallel orientation, or palisade, and which rarely branch or overlap each other. These hyphae, along with adhering mineral soil particles, are embedded in a gelatinous matrix. The hyphae of the ectomycorrhizae can become chlamydospores, an adaptation that helps the fungus tolerate unfavorable conditions. Chlamydospores of H.peckii have a peculiar structure—markedly distinct from those of other Bankeraceae—with thick, smooth inner walls and an outer wall that is <b>split</b> <b>radially</b> into warts. The most striking characteristic of the ectomycorrhizae {{as a whole is}} the way the black outer layers of older sections are shed, giving a [...] "carbonized appearance". The majority of the underground biomass of the fungus is concentrated near the surface, most likely as [...] "mycelial mats"—dense clusters of ectomycorrhizae and mycelium. The mycelium is also known to extend far beyond the site of the fruit bodies, as far as [...] away.|$|R
