40|$|The {{zoonotic}} {{introduction of}} an animal pathogen into the human population and the subsequent extension or alteration of its host range leading to the successful maintenance of the corresponding pathogen by human-to-human transmission pose a serious risk for world-wide health care.

40|$|AbstractTwo host <b>range</b> <b>switch</b> mutants of the {{immunosuppressive}} {{strain of}} parvovirus Minute Virus of Mice (MVMi) were isolated from plaques on A 9 fibroblasts. Both carried a single coding mutation at residue D 399 in VP 2, to alanine and glycine in hr 105 and hr 107, respectively, and a second, non-coding, guanine-to-adenine change at nucleotide 1970 in hr 105 and 1967 in hr 107. These mutations were recreated {{in a wild}} type MVMi infectious plasmid clone, both alone and as pairs, in either the original or switched combinations. All single mutants failed to replicate productively in fibroblasts, but the two pairs of changes were functionally equivalent. Single D 399 mutations allowed the viruses to initiate infection in fibroblasts, but NS 2 expression was severely restricted and correlated with poor accumulation and release of progeny virus. Mutations at 1967 or 1970 enhanced NS 2 accumulation, and allowed efficient progeny production and release. Conversely, the D 399 mutations destroyed the viruses' ability to infect EL 4 lymphocytes. In all productive EL 4 infections, NS 2 was expressed at high ratios {{even in the absence}} of upstream mutations, and progeny accumulation was efficient. However, EL 4 cells lack a mechanism for early progeny release, potentially explaining why virus amplification in these cells is slow...|$|E
40|$|The Rane ME 15 S microGraphic Equalizer is a two-channel, 2 / 3 -octave {{design with}} 20 mm sliders {{in a single}} rack space unit. It {{features}} a <b>Range</b> <b>switch</b> for high slider resolution in the ± 6 dB mode, equivalent resolution to 45 mm sliders found on double rack-space models. The ± 12 dB mode provides {{a wide range of}} control over system audio. The active filter sections feature Rane’s innovative constant-Q (constant bandwidth) design. Constant-Q means the bandwidth of each individual filter is guaranteed to be narrow enough to prevent unwarranted interaction between filters, yet wide enough to produce exactly the type of correction curve demanded by even the most unusual acoustic surroundings. This differs dramatically from conventional designs of the past, encumbered with the unfortunate characteristic of changing bandwidth when changing boost/cut amounts. Front panel controls and indicators include an overall rotary Level control for each channel as well as Overload indicators. Passive pushbutton Bypass switches feature LED indicators, avoiding ambiguity by being on when the unit is Bypassed. (A passive Bypass switch requires no power to operate. This al-lows completion of the audio path should the power fail in the ME 15 S.) Inputs and Outputs are electronically balanced designs, capable of unbalanced operation when required. They accept and drive all possible signal levels into normal load impedances. Balanced applications choose between the XLR or " Tip-Ring-Sleeve balanced connectors. Unbalanced sources also may tie to the ME 15 S through mono " connectors (no ring connection) ...|$|E

50|$|The {{method of}} {{turbocharging}} and supercharging an engine {{is referred to}} as twincharging. The Delta S4 was the first such example of this technology. Contemporary turbochargers were inefficient, as they did not produce boost at low RPMs. This phenomenon, known as turbo lag, negatively affects driveability, an important aspect of a rally car. Superchargers do not suffer from lag as they are powered directly from the engine's crankshaft, rather than by the exhaust gases. However, because of this direct mechanical connection, the supercharger presents a significant parasitic load to the engine at higher RPMs. Lancia designed their twincharger system so the supercharger provides instantaneous boost in the lower RPM <b>range,</b> <b>switching</b> to the turbocharger for more efficient higher RPM engine operation.|$|R
