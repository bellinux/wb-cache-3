Though OBB and Repo/Reverse Repo {{involve the}} {{exchange}} of cash for security with an agreement to buy back, a Repo has a predetermined <b>repurchase</b> <b>date</b> while an OBB is an open ended transaction and securities traded might never be repurchased before maturity.|$|E
40|$|Share repurchases {{have become}} an {{increasingly}} popular method for companies to distribute cash to its shareholders as many countries have removed restrictions related to this activity. By using a new and unique data set with complete information of each repurchase program, the long-run share price performance following actual share repurchases and whether managers trade strategically are examined for a sample of Swedish firms. I find that the announcement effect surrounding the first <b>repurchase</b> <b>date</b> is small but that repurchasing firms on average outperform several benchmarks {{during the first three}} years and thereby exhibit superior information of the stock price. Evidence of strategic trading is documented in small market cap firms. Finally, I document that Swedish firms repurchase more in the first half compared to {{the second half of the}} program and also that a higher completion rate is associated with high abnormal return.

40|$|Leverage is {{strongly}} related to liquidity in a market and lack of liquidity is considered a cause and/or consequence of the recent financial crisis. A repurchase agreement is a financial instrument where a security is sold simultaneously with an agreement to buy it back at a later <b>date.</b> <b>Repurchase</b> agreements (repos) market size {{is a very important}} element in calculating the overall leverage in a financial market. Therefore, studying the behavior of repos market size can help to understand a process that can contribute to the birth of a financial crisis. We hypothesize that herding behavior among large investors led to massive over-leveraging through the use of repos, resulting in a bubble (built up over the previous years) and subsequent crash in this market in early 2008. We use the Johansen-Ledoit-Sornette (JLS) model of rational expectation bubbles and behavioral finance to study the dynamics of the repo market that led to the crash. The JLS model qualifies a bubble by the presence of characteristic patterns in the price dynamics, called log-periodic power law (LPPL) behavior. We show that there was significant LPPL behavior in the market before that crash and that the predicted range of times predicted by the model {{for the end of the}} bubble is consistent with the observations. ...|$|R
