5|$|As the {{fighting}} was seemingly coming to an end, Carmelo Anthony confronted Collins and punched him in the face, knocking him to the ground. Jared Jeffries immediately tried to attack Anthony but tripped over Marcus Camby, before being restrained by coaches and teammates, while Anthony backed up towards the Nuggets' bench. Collins also <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> the court to get at Anthony but was blocked by Nenê and Smith. All ten players on the court {{at the time of}} the incident were ejected by the officiating crew that consisted of Dick Bavetta, Violet Palmer, and Robbie Robinson.|$|E
5|$|Burnham and Armstrong leapt {{over the}} dead Mlimo and <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> a trail toward their horses. The warriors {{in the village}} nearby picked up their arms and searched for the attackers; to {{distract}} them, Burnham set fire to some of their huts. The two men escaped and rode back to Bulawayo. Shortly after, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Matabele stronghold and made peace with the rebels, ending the Second Matabele War.|$|E
5|$|From about 200,000 in the 1900 Census, Minneapolis {{soared to}} its highest {{population}} recorded in 1950 of over 521,000 people. The main {{growth of the}} city was in part due to an organized private streetcar system. With 140 million passengers by 1920, the streetcars <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> important roads extending from Downtown Minneapolis. Neighborhood residential development out of the core mostly dates {{around the turn of the}} century as a result of this system. This growth also allowed Minneapolis to annex land from neighboring villages and townships which subsequently pushed the incorporation of today's inner ring suburbs.|$|E
25|$|They {{have had}} to {{apologize}} to head coach Bob Stoops twice: once for knocking him down during a pre-game <b>run</b> <b>down</b> the field at the Independence Bowl, and another time for patting him on the butt with their paddles, also during a pre-game <b>run</b> <b>down</b> the field.|$|R

5|$|Instead Taylor <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> the Armed Forces, {{letting go}} 2,400–2,600 former personnel, {{many of whom}} were Krahn brought in by former President Doe, in December 1997 – January 1998, and {{building}} up instead the Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU), the Special Operations Division of the Liberian National Police, and the Special Security Service. On November 19, 1999, Taylor named General Kpenkpah Konah as the new Chief of Staff of the AFL (where he would stay until 2006) and John Tarnue as head of the army. Tarnue was later implicated in a land dispute in 1999, while acting as AFL commander.|$|E
5|$|Tech's Jayron Hosley {{returned}} Florida State's subsequent kickoff to the Tech 35-yard line, {{where the}} Hokies' offense {{returned to the}} field. Tech advanced the ball with short rushes, gaining two first downs via quarterback sneaks from Taylor. The Hokies advanced {{as far as the}} Florida State 44-yard line, but Florida State sacked Taylor twice, denying the Hokies another first down. Tech <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> the clock, then punted with 42 seconds remaining in the first half. Rather than attempt to score in the final seconds, Florida State kneeled on the ball and let the first half end with Tech leading, 21–17.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} interstate {{trucking}} in the 1950s {{led to a}} drop in rail traffic throughout the nation. By 1960, the southernmost section of the line was demolished due to low use. This section started at Gansevoort Street and <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> Washington Street as far as Spring Street just north of Canal Street, representing {{almost half of the}} line. The last train on the remaining part of the line was operated by Conrail in 1980.|$|E

5|$|When built, the {{surrounding}} area was composed of dirt roads and private residences. The Southern Pacific Railroad's 1868 west side rail line <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> Fourth Avenue past City Hall and the county courthouse. The city and county governments fought the railroad to remove the dirty and noisy steam locomotives from this route, succeeding in 1912. Southern Pacific's electric interurban line continued on the tracks until the 1930s. In 2007, work began on adding light rail tracks on Fifth Avenue for the planned MAX Green Line, and trains once again ran past City Hall starting in 2009.|$|E
5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, turning their heads {{from side to side}} as if in an effort to be wise. If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.|$|E
5|$|After {{the teams}} traded punts {{to open the}} second half, Derrick Henry made the score 31–24 with his 43-yard {{touchdown}} run for the only points scored in the third quarter. Oklahoma next scored on their opening possession of the fourth quarter on a nine-yard Knight touchdown pass to Shepard that capped an eight-play drive. Later in the quarter, Henry scored his second long touchdown of the game for Alabama on a 61—yard reception from McCarron that cut the Oklahoma lead to 38–31. However, the Sooners closed {{the game with a}} long drive that <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> the clock and in the final minute, an Eric Striker sack of McCarron caused a fumble that Grissom recovered and returned eight-yards for a touchdown and made the final score 45–31. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against the Sooners 1–3–1.|$|E

5|$|England {{began their}} second innings {{on the third}} afternoon. Late in the day, after scoring 13 in 43 minutes, Edrich was caught behind by Don Tallon after {{attempting}} a cut shot from Johnson’s bowling. Edrich did not read the arm ball, which went straight on and took the outside edge, leaving England at 2/39. Denis Compton came in and he <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> the pitch before the first ball was bowled; he had to quickly block {{the ball on the}} run. He then survived a confident lbw appeal from the bowling of Johnson when he was on eight. Compton appeared resigned to his fate and ready to walk, but umpire Frank Chester declined the appeal. During this passage of play, Johnson extracted a substantial amount of spin from the surface. England closed the day at 2/121.|$|E
5|$|On 16 May 1289, the priory {{suffered}} a catastrophic fire. According to an account by Walter of Guisborough, a plumber soldering the lead roof forgot {{to put out}} his fire, causing the roof timbers to catch fire and molten lead <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> into the church below. Much of the building was destroyed and many effects, costly books, chalices and vestments were lost. The canons sought {{to raise funds for}} rebuilding. They petitioned the king to grant them the advowsons of the parish churches of Barnham, Easington and Heslerton, and in 1309 and 1311 the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Durham rewarded the priory's donors with indulgences granting remission of temporal punishment for sins. Most of the nave and chancel was rebuilt {{with the support of the}} de Brus family, whose coat of arms was displayed on its buildings.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, news reached New York that Congress {{had voted}} for {{independence}} four days earlier. On Tuesday, July 9, at 18:00, Washington had several brigades march onto the commons {{of the city}} to hear the Declaration of Independence read. After the end of the reading, a mob <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> to Bowling Green with ropes and bars, where they tore down the gilded lead equestrian statue of George III of Great Britain. In their fury, the crowd cut off the statue's head, severed the nose, and mounted what remained of the head on a spike outside a tavern, {{and the rest of the}} statue was dragged to Connecticut and melted down into musket balls.|$|E

5|$|Roma had {{a chance}} to equalise in the 27th minute, but Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar saved Conti's low shot. Neal was shown a yellow card in the 32nd minute for {{bringing}} down Conti, and a few minutes later Liverpool had an opportunity to extend their lead. Liverpool striker Rush charged down Dario Bonetti's clearance and ran onto the ball, but his shot was saved by Tancredi. With minutes remaining until half-time, Roma equalised. Sebastiano Nela passed to Conti, who <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> the left-hand side of the pitch. His first attempt at crossing the ball into the penalty area was blocked by a combination of Neal and Mark Lawrenson, but his cross rebounded back to him. His second attempt found Roberto Pruzzo in the penalty area, whose glancing header went into the Liverpool goal to level the scores at 1–1.|$|E
5|$|Tech punted, and Stanford's offense {{returned}} to the field. The two teams traded possessions one more time, with Stanford turning the ball over on downs after a failed fourth-down conversion attempt, and Virginia Tech returning the ball with another punt. Following the kick, Stanford's offense began work from its 14-yard line with 8:08 remaining in the quarter. Two plays gained fiveyards, then Luck completed a 21-yard pass to wide receiver Doug Baldwin for just the second first down of the game. On the next play, Stanford running back Jeremy Stewart broke free of the Virginia Tech defense and <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> the field 60yards for a touchdown. The score and subsequent extra point gave Stanford a 7–0 lead with 6:16 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{government}} {{also tried to}} raise revenue through unorthodox means. Early on (in {{the first half of}} 1861), when the support for the separation from the Union and the military effort was running strong, the donation of coins and gold to the government accounted for about 35% of all sources of government funds. This source, however, dried up over time as individuals and institutions in the South both <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> their personal holdings of bullion and became more unwilling to make donations as war-weariness set in. As a consequence, by the summer of 1862, the share of government revenue coming from these donations fell to less than 1%. Over the course of the entire war this source of revenue contributed only 0.2% of total wartime expenditure.|$|E

5|$|The first {{championship}} {{defense of}} WrestleMania was between Junkyard Dog and the reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Greg Valentine, who was accompanied {{to the ring}} by his manager Jimmy Hart. Junkyard Dog began the match in the offensive position, performing headbutts and punches on Valentine. As the action went back and forth, Hart climbed on the ring apron, where Valentine accidentally hit him. Later, Valentine pinned Junkyard Dog with {{his feet on the}} ropes for leverage, which is an illegal maneuver. As a result, Tito Santana <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> to the ring and explained to the referee what had happened and the match was restarted. Junkyard Dog eventually won the match by count-out as Valentine failed to re-enter the ring. Valentine, however, kept his title as titles do not change hands through count-out.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} Eddie Guerrero versus Rey Mysterio in a {{standard}} match. In the match, Mysterio tried to counter Guerrero's offense, but Guerrero blocked all of Mysterio's attempts. Mysterio gained the advantage when {{he was able to}} execute a flying headbutt to Guerrero. Chavo <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> to the ring to distract the referee, as Eddie grabbed a chair. Guerrero then attempted to hit Mysterio with the chair, but Mysterio dodged it with a low dropkick and performed another low dropkick, setting up Guerrero on the ropes for a 619. Mysterio won the match after Guerrero was disqualified for hitting him with a steel chair.|$|E
5|$|The {{next season}} Vanderbilt tied Navy and met rival Sewanee, {{in a battle}} of the unbeaten for the mythical crown of the South, and won using a trick double-pass play. Sewanee led 12–11 with twelve minutes to play. At McGugin's signal, the Commodores went into a freakish {{formation}} in which Stein Stone remained at center but all the other players shifted to his left. Quarterback Hugh Potts took the snap and lateraled the ball to Vaughn Blake, who lateraled it across to Bob Blake, who had lined up deep in punt formation, as Stone <b>ran</b> <b>down</b> the field. Blake completed a 35-yard pass to Stone who was inside the 5-yard line. Honus Craig ran it in to win the game. It was cited by journalist Grantland Rice as the greatest thrill he ever witnessed in his years of watching sports.|$|E
