The apparent deviation of a basic component involved a four inch <b>regulating</b> <b>valve</b> that would not fully close during post installation calibration. The <b>regulating</b> <b>valve</b> is used to control essential chilled water system chiller refrigerant pressure. APS completed the required evaluation based on inspections by the supplier, Flowserve US, Inc. The evaluation concluded the <b>regulating</b> <b>valve</b> would not fully close during calibration because the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> guide had become dislodged from the normal installed position. This is postulated to have occurred {{as a result of a}} fluid pressure surge inside the valve caused by incomplete venting of the valve prior to initiating water flow through the valve during calibration. Since the inability of the <b>regulating</b> <b>valve</b> to fully close during calibration resulted from maintenance activities during valve installation, no deviation in a A member of the STAR...|$|R

50|$|The <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is a tube made {{of metal}} or rubber, {{through which the}} tire is inflated, with a check valve, {{typically}} a Schrader valve on automobiles and most bicycle tires, or a Presta valve on high-performance bicycles. <b>Valve</b> <b>stems</b> usually protrude through the wheel for easy access. They mount directly to the rim, {{in the case of}} tubeless tires, or {{are an integral part of}} the inner tube. The rubber in <b>valve</b> <b>stems</b> eventually degrades, and, in the case of tubeless tires, replacement of the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> at regular intervals or with tire replacement reduces the chance of failure. Some may notice that their <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> is all metal with a nut retaining it (as opposed to the typical rubber stem with brass threads). Most modern passenger vehicles are now required to have a tire pressure monitoring system which usually consists of a <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> attached to an electronic module.

40|$|A {{pressure}} <b>regulating</b> <b>valve</b> {{is a type}} of {{flow control}} device that is a combination of a control orifice and a flow compensator.

The CFD analysis was applied to analyze and evaluate the various flow rates and patterns and thus estimate the pressure <b>regulating</b> control <b>valve</b> flow compensation force and characteristic curve. The CFD model is used to validate the dynamic behavior of the pressure <b>regulating</b> <b>valve</b> to bypass the fuel flow from a high pressure gear pump and to compensate burn flow of the metering valve.

25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and exhaust valves under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each <b>valve</b> <b>stem,</b> the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> also locks the collet halves in place to the <b>valve</b> <b>stem.</b> To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|R

Although a better heat conductor, an aluminium cylinder head requires steel valve seat inserts, where a cast iron cylinder head would often have employed integral valve seats in the past. Because the <b>valve</b> <b>stem</b> extends into lubrication in the cam chamber, it must be sealed against blow-by to prevent cylinder gases from escaping into the crankcase, even though the <b>stem</b> to <b>valve</b> clearance is very small, typically 0.04-0.06 mm, so a rubber lip-type seal is used to ensure that excessive oil is not drawn in from the crankcase on the induction stroke, and that exhaust gas does not enter the crankcase on the exhaust stroke. Worn valve guides and/or defective oil seals can often be diagnosed by a puff of blue smoke from the exhaust pipe on releasing the accelerator pedal after allowing the engine to overrun, when there is high manifold vacuum. Such a condition occurs when changing gear.|$|R
