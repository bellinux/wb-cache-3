As of May 2013, plans for a downtown park and plaza complex were underway. In 2014, the lot was repaved, leaving the AMC Theaters building foundation in place, but filling inside its permiter with sod. The lot was rechristened Town Square Park and opened in early 2014.

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} two {{mechanisms to}} procure differentiated goods: a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote</b> and an English auction with bidding credits. In the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote,</b> each seller submits a {{price and the}} inherent quality of his good. Then the buyer selects the seller who offers the greatest difference in quality and price. In the English auction with bidding credits, the buyer assigns a bidding credit to each seller conditional upon {{the quality of the}} seller’s good. Then the sellers compete in an English auction with the winner receiving the auction price and his bidding credit. Game theoretic models predict the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote</b> is socially efficient but the English auction with bidding credits is not. The optimal bidding credit assignment under compensates for quality advantages, creating a market distortion in which the buyer captures surplus {{at the expense of the}} seller’s profit and social efficiency. In experiments, the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote</b> is less efficient than the English auctions with bidding credits. Moreover, both the buyer and seller receive more surplus in the English auction with bidding credits. ...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of dynamic}} auctions {{is a major}} {{component}} in many enterprises' e-procurement initiatives. In the case where suppliers offer goods and services of inherently different quality the traditional mechanism has been the <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote.</b> In a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quote,</b> suppliers submit a sealed bid and the fixed quality of their offering and then the buyer selects the seller who offers the greatest difference between quality and price. The winning seller receives a price equal to his submitted bid. The reverse auction has immerged as the most commonly adopted dynamic auction for this setting. In a reverse auction, suppliers first submit the qualities of their goods and then the suppliers participate in an auction with the same message space as an open outcry English auction (descending {{because this is a}} procurement auction.) However, the auction is only used to set each suppliers price. The last price a supplier submits in the auction becomes their actual submitted price. After, the auction the buyer selects the winning seller who offers the greatest difference between quality and actual submitted price. We provide a game theoretic analysis of both mechanisms.

40|$|We {{consider}} a manufacturer using a <b>Request</b> <b>For</b> <b>Quotes</b> reverse auction {{in combination with}} supplier qualification screening to determine which qualified supplier will be awarded a contract. Supplier qualification screening is costly for the manufacturer, for example involving reference checks, financial audits, and on-site visits. The manufacturer seeks to minimize its total procurement costs, i. e. the contract payment plus qualification costs. While suppliers can be qualified prior to the auction (pre-qualification), we allow the manufacturer to delay {{all or part of}} the qualification until after the auction (post-qualification). Using an optimal mechanism analysis we analytically explore the tradeoffs between varying levels of pre- and post-qualification. While using post-qualification causes the expected contract payment to increase (bids from unqualified suppliers are discarded) we find that standard industrial practices of pre-qualification only can be improved upon by judicious use of post-qualification, particularly when supplier qualification screening is moderately expensive relative to the value of the contract to the buyer...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{multiple}} attributes while evaluating <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotes</b> (RFQs) {{responses from}} suppliers is gaining significant importance in industrial procurement. While price {{has traditionally been}} {{the most important factor}} in evaluating RFQ responses, incorporation of non-price attributes such as quality and delivery performance is becoming essential and critical. Research on multi-attribute RFQs has received significant attention in an auction format with models addressing issues relating to auction mechanism design, winner determination, and auction dynamics, primarily from a buyer's perspective. There have been few approaches, if any, that have investigated the issue of response to multi-attribute RFQs from a supplier's perspective, which is the focus of this paper. Such an approach will assist a supplier in effectively responding to RFQs, thereby maximizing the likelihood of winning future contracts. It also indirectly assists in supplier development and helps foster competition among suppliers, which benefits both the buyers and the suppliers.

40|$|The {{procurement}} {{of transportation}} services {{is an important}} task for shippers {{because of the need}} to control costs {{at the same time as}} providing high service levels. When shippers with goods and/or materials to transport seek transportation services from outside companies they typically put out a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotes</b> from a set of carriers. They then assign contracts based on negotiated service charges. This process is similar to a simple sealed-bid auction in which each bidder submits a sealed bid for a single item. In the past, when shippers need to procure transportation services for a set of distinctive delivery routes (called lanes) they would obtain quotes for each lane individually and repeat the simple auction process for each lane. Alternatively, they might negotiate for bundles of lanes with a single carrier at a time. However, in the last few years software has been developed to allow shippers to make all lanes available for bidding simultaneously and to allow carriers to simultaneously bid upon combinations of individual lanes. This method of awarding contracts, conventionally called a combinatorial auction, has been reported to result in significant cost savings for shippers. Our research examines the benefits of combinatorial auctions primarily from the carrier's perspective. Preliminary findings, based on a simple simulation model suggest that benefits for carriers can also be significant. Urban Studies and Planning...|$|E

They came onto {{the scene in the}} late 1990 's. There are independent exchanges, those formed by industry consortia, and private exchanges which are formed for the exclusive use of the single owner and its suppliers and customers. E-marketplaces support nearly all major types of B 2 B transactions, such as sales via catalogs, contracts, auctions, procurement via reverse auctions and RFQ's (<b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotes),</b> and trading via exchanges. At the height of the dot-com boom, there were approximately 2, 500 B 2 B exchanges worldwide. There was tremendous hype and expectations surrounding them. They were to revolutionize the way companies do business and fundamentally transform industries and the global economy. But the B 2 B e-marketplace has experienced a shakeout, and most have merged, closed down, or been converted to software vendors. Only about 1, 000 are still operating, and this number will likely decline further. Even so, there are still great benefits to be had in the B 2 B exchange arena. B 2 B digital marketplaces reduce transaction costs by automating purchasing and sales processes. They reduce information inefficiencies by making prices more transparent and aggregating relevant real-time industry news into one easily accessible place, and they diminish geographic limitations.

40|$|Procurement {{has emerged}} as a {{critical}} function, yet a challenging topic, since in many firms procurement operations are complex, and laced with misaligned incentives and information asymmetry between buyers and suppliers. This dissertation explores three different contexts that arise from a buyer’s lack of information. The first essay explores the value of cost modeling in competitive bid procurement, to understand if, how and when cost modeling should be deployed. I show that although bid competition sometimes duplicates the information gleaned by cost modeling, the latter can still be beneficial when it helps the buyer set an effective reserve price. Then I analyze how the buyer can gain the most benefit through cost modeling. Specifically, I characterize which supplier(s) to learn about, which portion(s) of the costs to learn, and how deeply and broadly the buyer should learn for general supply base topologies. The second essay studies the problem that a buyer's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotes</b> (RFQ) contains an error that triggers re-design and associated supplier windfall profit. Surprisingly, I find that RFQ error encourages suppliers to submit lower bids with anticipation of future windfall profit. I also find that supplier disparity in error-detecting expertise generally hurts the buyer. Furthermore, I propose a "pre-pay" and “error-bounty” approach to stem supplier windfall profit and induce knowledgeable suppliers to divulge the existence of RFQ error. The third essay considers whether a buyer should exclude or include an incumbent supplier in the auction. Excluding the incumbent allows the buyer to set an aggressive reserve price while including the incumbent in the auction drums up competition with one more bidder. I find that the buyer’s decision depends on the incumbent’s and entrants’ cost distributions: When the incumbent’s cost is expected to be substantially different from the entrants’ (either much lower or much higher) and has low uncertainty, excluding the incumbent is the better option; Conversely, when the incumbent’s cost is comparable to the entrants’ and has similar amount of uncertainty, the buyer prefers inviting the incumbent to the auction...|$|E
40|$|E-marketplaces {{are trading}} {{platforms}} that offer e-commerce online trade between several {{buying and selling}} companies. They enable good trading possibilities by supporting different business models such as multi-supplier catalog-based e-sales and e-procurement, pinboard or exchange system {{as well as several}} types of auctions. E-marketplaces give their participants the ability on the one side to acquire new trading partners or even new markets {{and on the other side}} to simplify their procurement and sales processes for reducing costs. This sector of e-commerce is growing rapidly and is predicted to reach 37 percent of overall e-commerce, generating total revenues up to 6 trillion US dollars worldwide by the end of 2004 [22, 26]. The main goal of e-marketplaces in their formation phase from the end of 1995 to 1998 was to bring different trading partners together. However, the requirements on e-marketplaces already increased within this phase. Companies demand additional features for lowering costs and for automation and optimization of their business processes. According to this, the ostensible task for e-marketplaces in the second phase from 1998 to 2001 was to offer more value adding services through intensively support the value chain such as with offering services for initiation, fulfillment, and completion of trading transactions including shipment, payment and logistic services. Nevertheless, today's e-marketplaces lack of fully automated business processes and still require a significant manual effort by human users. The mobile agent technology might take e-commerce trading to the next phase. Mobile agents are intelligent, independent, and pro active electronic representatives of businesses such as buyers, suppliers, customers, or even whole companies which can relieve marketplace participants from lots of routine works. The mobile agent technology can be a suitable approach for resolving the given problems. On the one hand intelligent stationary agents add automated trading capabilities and intelligent negotiation models for example for auctions, <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotes,</b> and request for proposals and on the other hand mobile agents can easily offer connections to mobile devices such as personal digital assistants or mobile phones. Besides, mobile agents add even more business opportunities because they can represent a company on different marketplaces everywhere in the world at the same time without human involvement. This can lead to a new quality of saving costs while expanding business activities. The following document describes the requirements for a new approach of an e-marketplace called InterMarket, which integrates the mobile agent technology. A feasibility study, made for two existing software applications, the mobile-agent system Tracy and the e-commerce platform Enfinity, investigates the ability to combine both solutions to form the new agent-based e-marketplace. In conclusion, recommendations are made for not yet fulfilled features to reach the identified requirements.

40|$|We {{consider}} the problem faced by a seller in determining an optimal price to quote {{in response to}} a <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>Quote</b> (RFQ) from a prospective buyer. The optimal price is determined by maximizing expected profit, given the underlying seller costs of the bid items and a computed probability of winning the bid as a function of price and other bid features such as buyer characteristics and the degree of competition. An entropy-based information-gain metric is used to quantify the contribution of the extracted features to predicting the win/loss label. A naive Bayes classification model is developed to predict the bid outcome (win or loss) as a function of these features. This model naturally generates the win probability as a function of bid price required to compute the optimal price. Results obtained by applying this model to a database of bid transactions involving computer sales demonstrate statistically significant lift curves for predicting bid outcome. A method for creating additional synthetic bids to improve computation of the win probability function is demonstrated. Finally, the computed optimal prices generated via this approach are compared to the actual bid prices approved by human pricing experts...|$|R

For this project an injection molded plastic plate made of polypropylene copolymer was chosen as a test part, and <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotes</b> were sent to 64 plastic injection molding firms around the world. Shipping costs were calculated based on a test firm location of Chicago, Illinois. The further the manufacturer is from the test firm location, the higher the shipping costs are. The manufacturing costs are generally lower for Asian manufacturers than for European or American manufacturers, varying inversely proportionally to the distance from the test firm location. Overall, the combined manufacturing and shipping costs are approximately parabolic when expressed as a function of distance from the test firm location. by Linda Yu Liu. Thesis (S. B.)
