5|$|Collecting {{butterflies}} {{was once}} a popular hobby; it has now largely been replaced by photography, recording, and <b>rearing</b> butterflies for release into the wild. The zoological illustrator Frederick William Frohawk succeeded in <b>rearing</b> all the butterfly species found in Britain, {{at a rate of}} four per year, to enable him to draw every stage of each species. He published the results in the folio sized handbook The Natural History of British Butterflies in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Heinrich Mallison in 2011 {{argued that}} Opisthocoelicaudia {{was able to}} angle the {{anterior}} part of the tail against the posterior part, producing a buckle in midsection. Thus, the anterior part {{would have been more}} straight during <b>rearing</b> than in other sauropods. In 2005, Wilson assumed that <b>rearing</b> was an innovation not only of Opisthocoelicaudia but also of related genera within the subfamily Saltasaurinae. Common features of these genera, such as the shortened tail, may have evolved as adaptations to <b>rearing.</b>|$|E

5|$|Opisthocoelicaudia {{may have}} been able to rear up on its hindlimbs for foraging, using its tail as a third leg. In 1977, Borsuk-Białynicka cited several {{skeletal}} features that might have been related to <b>rearing,</b> including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail, which, according to this author, would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods. Features of the pelvis, such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum, the flaring ilia, and the fused pubic symphysis, may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of <b>rearing.</b>|$|E

5|$|Until the mid-19thcentury duck <b>rearing</b> was {{concentrated}} on the Duck End, but by the 1860s it had spread to many other towns and villages in the area, particularly Weston Turville and Haddenham. Contamination of Aylesbury's soil by years of duck <b>rearing,</b> and new public health legislation which ended many traditional practices, caused {{the decline of the}} duck <b>rearing</b> industry in the Duck End, and by the 1890s the majority of Aylesbury ducks were raised in the villages rather than the town itself. Population shifts and the improved national rail network reduced the need to rear ducks near London, and large duck farms opened in Lancashire, Norfolk and Lincolnshire. Although the number of ducks raised nationwide continued to grow, between 1890 and 1900 the number of ducks raised in the Aylesbury area remained static, and from 1900 it began to drop.|$|E
5|$|A {{paternity}} {{analysis of}} yellow-faced honeyeater nestlings found that 10 of 18 nestlings were fathered by the male of the nesting pair, with clear evidence for extra-pair paternity {{in the case}} of the remaining 44%. This conflicts with the usual pattern, where genetic monogamy is linked to the characteristics of strong social pairing, essential paternal contributions to brood <b>rearing,</b> and to sexual monomorphism; characteristics exhibited by the yellow honeyeater.|$|E

5|$|American crows are {{socially}} monogamous cooperative breeding birds. Mated pairs form large families {{of up to}} 15 individuals from several breeding seasons that remain together for many years.

5|$|Mothers {{give birth}} to furred and blind cubs in an {{underground}} den near the river shore and fishing sites. Males actively participate in <b>rearing</b> cubs and family cohesion is strong; older, juvenile siblings also participate in <b>rearing,</b> although in the weeks immediately after birth, they may temporarily leave the group. Pups open their eyes in their fourth week, begin walking in their fifth, {{and are able to}} swim confidently between 12 and 14 weeks old. They are weaned by nine months and begin hunting successfully soon after. The animal reaches sexual maturity at about two years of age and both male and female pups leave the group permanently after two to three years. They then search for new territory to begin a family of their own.|$|E
5|$|Neolithic people {{experienced}} {{an economy that}} included hunting, gathering, fishing and animal <b>rearing.</b> Paddy husk impressions in some potsherds indicate Neolithic involvement in cultivating rice and cereals such as wheat, moong, masoor, and barley.

50|$|The Celica Cruising Deck was {{a concept}} vehicle built by Toyota and first {{shown at the}} October 1999 Tokyo Motor Show.

5|$|Zoo or {{laboratory}} <b>rearing</b> and isolation are important factors leading to increased susceptibility to self-harm in higher mammals, e.g., macaque monkeys.

5|$|A 2015 {{study of}} the necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus found many {{differences}} between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may {{have shown that the}} necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were used for intraspecific combat. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion is that they were used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when <b>rearing.</b>|$|E
