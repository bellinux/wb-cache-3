5|$|The Bristol Area Resignalling Scheme in the 1970s saw the Down <b>Relief</b> <b>line,</b> {{the most}} {{southern}} {{of the four}} running lines, converted to a siding linking Malago Vale carriage sidings to the east with the West Depot carriage sidings to the west. At the same time, Parson Street Junction was reworked, requiring trains to first cross from the Down Main line to the Up Main line before {{they were able to}} access the Portishead Branch. The Down <b>Relief</b> <b>line</b> was removed altogether when West Depot closed sometime after the opening of a new depot at St Philips Marsh to service High Speed Trains.|$|E
5|$|Just {{beyond the}} station, to the west, are {{a pair of}} relief lines to allow slower trains to be overtaken. There are also some {{cross-over}} points, allowing trains to terminate on the westbound <b>relief</b> <b>line</b> and then return eastwards.|$|E
5|$|The Down <b>Relief</b> <b>line</b> between Bristol Temple Meads and Parson Street {{is to be}} {{partially}} reinstated {{as part of the}} MetroWest scheme in order to ease congestion. According to the Great Western Route Utilisation Strategy, in the December 2007 timetable period, the line through Parson Street was running at over 75% capacity in the morning peak between 8 and 9am. It was predicted that by 2019, trains working the line would be completely full during peak hours. While the three tracks could cope with traffic generated by the reopening of the Portishead Line, campaigners note it would leave little room for growth. Parson Street Junction will also be upgraded during the works.|$|E
25|$|In August 2008 it was {{announced}} that a number of speed limits on the <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> between Reading and London have been raised so that 86% of the line can be used at , however the time allowed between stations for trains running on the <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> has been reduced in the December 2008 timetable to improve timekeeping.|$|R

Consequently, the station is frequently served by a replacement bus service at night.|$|R
25|$|The {{cost of the}} <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> is {{estimated}} at C$6.2 billion to 8.3 billion depending on alignment and phasing. The <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> {{is included in the}} regional transportation plan The Big Move, and is one of Metrolinx's top 15 transit priorities.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> {{disappeared}} from transit plans {{soon after the}} province delayed approving Metropolitan Toronto's Network 2011 plan. The provincial government was alarmed over the construction cost and withdrew political support for the new line. There have been no serious plans for the <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> {{for the next two}} decades.|$|E
25|$|The TTC {{released}} the Network 2011 plan in 1985, and a <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> {{was one of}} the three routes proposed. As part of the 2011 Network plan, the <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> was proposed to run between Pape station on the Bloor–Danforth line, south to Eastern Avenue, and then west to Union Station, the Rogers Centre (then known as the SkyDome) and Spadina Avenue.|$|E

25|$|In May 2017, Toronto Mayor John Tory {{announced}} he would not support planning for the Yonge North Subway Extension {{unless there is a}} funding commitment for the <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> to relieve crowding on Line 1, expected to be at capacity by 2031. If so authorized, city staff could complete 15-30 per cent of the design for both projects, including schedules and better estimates, by the end of 2019. As of May 2017, planning was more advanced for the Yonge extension than for the <b>Relief</b> <b>Line.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Downtown Rapid Transit Expansion Study (DRTES) was {{completed}} by the TTC in 2012, which examined four alternative <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> configurations between Pape and St. Andrew, with varying extensions north to Science Centre station (at Don Mills and Eglinton), and west to Dundas West station. The TTC's 2015 DRL study identified four potential corridors, which involved combinations beginning at Line 2 at Broadview or Pape, and going through downtown via King or Queen Streets. On March 31, 2016, Toronto City Council approved a <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> corridor between Pape station and Toronto City Hall, via Pape Avenue and Queen Street. The study is ongoing and examining potential alignments.|$|E

5000|$|Platform 6, for {{stopping}} services to London, was {{provided with a}} siding between the main and <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> at {{the east end of}} the station. This was used for storing the local train between services. The siding was removed in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The station opened {{along with}} the line. The service at Marshfield was always modest, with just three trains per day in 1869. <b>Relief</b> <b>lines</b> at Marshfield were {{completed}} in stages between 1896 and 1898. The station had 13 to 14 employees in the 1930s.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> (formerly the Downtown <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> or DRL) is a {{proposed}} rapid transit {{line for the}} Toronto subway system, intended to provide capacity relief to the Yonge segment of Line 1 and Bloor–Yonge station and extend subway service coverage. Several routes are being considered. Several plans for an east–west downtown subway {{date back to the}} early 20th century, most of which ran along Queen Street. Since the early 21st century, studies propose a line that would run south from Line 2 Bloor–Danforth, before bending westward along Queen Street into Downtown Toronto. Potential extensions could be made northward from its Line 2 connection in the east, as well as westward and northward from downtown to form a U-shape.|$|E
25|$|Other {{more distant}} {{aspirations}} include resignalling and capacity improvements at Reading; {{the provision of}} four continuous tracks between Didcot and Swindon (including a grade-separated junction at Milton, where westbound <b>relief</b> <b>line</b> switches from {{the north side of}} the line to the south); and resignalling between Bath and Bristol to enable trains to run closer together.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> is to help reduce current and {{projected}} congestion in downtown Toronto. In 2012, it was becoming apparent to the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) and Metrolinx that even with proposed improvements, the Yonge line and Bloor–Yonge station was facing significant capacity constraints. , the Yonge line operates 11% over its capacity south of Line 2 during the morning rush hour. The new Toronto Rocket trains operating on the line, and the future implementation of Automatic Train Control will help increase {{the capacity of the}} Yonge line. Other factors are expected to reduce demand such as the extension of the University–Spadina portion of Line 1 into Vaughan, and other local transit improvements. However, after factoring in population and employment growth and the proposed extension of the Yonge line into Richmond Hill, the Yonge line is projected to be at 96% of its capacity by 2031. The <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> will provide an alternate route for commuters heading downtown by allowing them to bypass the congested Yonge line and avoid transferring at Bloor–Yonge Station.|$|E
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{stopping}} service, Heathrow Connect, {{which takes}} the same route but using the slower <b>relief</b> <b>lines,</b> on which significantly lower fares are charged. This takes approximately 15 minutes longer than Heathrow Express, but offers connections to the London Underground Central and District lines at Ealing Broadway.|$|R

25|$|Toronto council {{approved}} {{the plan in}} principle in January 2009 provided there were upgrades to the existing line to support the additional ridership from York Region. Specifically, Toronto politicians say that the Yonge line {{does not have the}} capacity to support an extension to Richmond Hill until a separate <b>relief</b> <b>line</b> is built between Pape and Osgoode stations. In March 2016, the mayor's office said that SmartTrack and automatic train control may also be required.|$|E
25|$|On August 25, 1910, {{the first}} serious {{proposal}} for the <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> was made by Jacobs & Davies, a New York City‐based firm of consulting engineers, with The Report on Transit to the Mayor and Council of the City of Toronto. An underground streetcar formed a rough U-shape from today's Broadview station, along the waterfront to Spadina Avenue, and then following Spadina Avenue, College Street, Dovercourt Road, Bloor Street and Dundas Street to the West Toronto Diamond.|$|E
25|$|On June 1, 2016, {{the provincial}} {{government}} announced $150 million funding for Metrolinx to plan and design the <b>Relief</b> <b>Line.</b> Metrolinx would collaborate with the TTC and the City in the design. Mayor John Tory estimated the line could be operational within 12 to 15 years (2028–2031). In late June of the same year, a Toronto Star article reported the estimated cost of Phase 1 with eight stops to be $6.8 billion; the project was unfunded.|$|E
50|$|Three {{years later}} {{it had to}} be rebuilt to allow for the two extra tracks to be laid from Cogload Junction to Taunton, after which the {{platforms}} were only available to the <b>relief</b> <b>lines</b> on the outside; trains on the main lines, which were generally running to and from London Paddington, could not call.|$|R

25|$|Tory {{registered}} {{as a candidate}} for the 2014 Toronto mayoral election on February 24, 2014. In his launch video he stated that building a Yonge Street <b>Relief</b> <b>line</b> is “job one” if elected mayor. On May 27 he announced his Yonge Street relief plan, entitled SmartTrack, providing electric commuter rail along existing GO train infrastructure with service from Unionville to Mississauga. SmartTrack is to be completed in seven years. On October 27, 2014, Tory was elected to be the next mayor of Toronto.|$|E
25|$|The Yonge North Subway Extension (YNSE) is a {{proposal}} to extend Line 1 Yonge–University north along Yonge Street from Finch station, the existing terminus of Line 1, to Richmond Hill. There would be new stations at Drewry/Cummer, Steeles Avenue, Clark Avenue, Royal Orchard Boulevard, Langstaff Road and the existing Richmond Hill Centre Terminal (Highway 7). The province's MoveOntario 2020 plan proposed this extension. The main problem with this proposal is that Line 1 is at capacity, and the TTC says that the <b>Relief</b> <b>Line</b> and SmartTrack must both be in service before opening the YNSE.|$|E
25|$|Originally, The Big Move {{had called}} for the DRL to {{terminate}} at Danforth Avenue, and for the Don Mills LRT to continue north to Sheppard Avenue and Highway 7.

From Danforth Avenue, the extension would proceed north on Pape Avenue through Pape Village, across the Don Valley to Leaside; east on Overlea Boulevard through Thorncliffe Park; and north again on Don Mills Road to Sheppard Avenue and Don Mills station.|$|E
