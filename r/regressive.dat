5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat <b>regressive</b> tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the <b>regressive</b> nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% for the lowest earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
5|$|Brezhnev's {{stabilisation}} policy included ending the liberalising reforms of Khrushchev, and clamping down on cultural freedom. During the Khrushchev years, Brezhnev had supported the leader's denunciations of Stalin's arbitrary rule, {{the rehabilitation of}} many of the victims of Stalin's purges, and the cautious liberalisation of Soviet intellectual and cultural policy. But as soon as he became leader, Brezhnev began to reverse this process, and developed an increasingly conservative and <b>regressive</b> attitude.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{there were}} {{problems}} {{with all of these}} hypotheses: the <b>regressive</b> hypothesis did not explain why even the smallest of cellular parasites do not resemble viruses in any way. The escape hypothesis did not explain the complex capsids and other structures on virus particles. The virus-first hypothesis contravened the definition of viruses in that they require host cells. Viruses are now recognised as ancient and as having origins that pre-date the divergence of life into the three domains. This discovery has led modern virologists to reconsider and re-evaluate these three classical hypotheses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Regressive</b> {{hypothesis}} : Viruses {{may have}} once been small cells that parasitised larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost. The bacteria rickettsia and chlamydia are living cells that, like viruses, can reproduce only inside host cells. They {{lend support to}} this hypothesis, as their dependence on parasitism {{is likely to have}} caused the loss of genes that enabled them to survive outside a cell. This is also called the degeneracy hypothesis, or reduction hypothesis.|$|E

5|$|The depositional {{environment}} was a nearshore {{one where the}} seashore alternated between advance (transgression) and retreat (regression). At Zion, the limestones and fossils of the Timpoweap, Virgin Limestone, and Shnabkaib members of the Moenkopi Formation document transgressive episodes. Unlike the Timpoweap and Virgin Limestone members, the Shnabkaib contains abundant gypsum and interbedded mudstone resulting from deposition in a restricted marine environment with complex watertable fluctuations. <b>Regressive,</b> red bed layers separate the transgressive strata. Ripple marks, mud cracks, and thinly laminated bedding suggest that these intervening red shale and siltstone units were deposited in tidal flat and coastalplain environments.|$|E
5|$|The {{religious}} {{struggles of}} the 17th century left a deep sectarian division in Ireland. Religious allegiance now determined the perception in law of loyalty to the Irish King and Parliament. After {{the passing of the}} Test Act 1672, and with the victory of the forces of the dual monarchy of William and Mary over the Jacobites, Roman Catholics and nonconforming Protestant Dissenters were barred from sitting as members in the Irish Parliament. Under the emerging Penal Laws, Irish Roman Catholics and Dissenters were increasingly deprived of various and sundry civil rights even to the ownership of hereditary property. Additional <b>regressive</b> punitive legislation followed 1703, 1709 and 1728. This completed a comprehensive systemic effort to materially disadvantage Roman Catholics and Protestant Dissenters, while enriching a new ruling class of Anglican conformists. The new Anglo-Irish ruling class became known as the Protestant Ascendancy.|$|E
5|$|The top 10% paid 51.8% {{of total}} federal taxes in 2009, {{and the top}} 1%, with 13.4% of pre-tax {{national}} income, paid 22.3% of federal taxes. In 2013 the Tax Policy Center projected total federal effective tax rates of 35.5% for the top 1%, 27.2% for the top quintile, 13.8% for the middle quintile, and −2.7% for the bottom quintile. The incidence of corporate income tax has {{been a matter of}} considerable ongoing controversy for decades. State and local taxes vary widely, but are generally less progressive than federal taxes as they rely heavily on broadly borne <b>regressive</b> sales and property taxes that yield less volatile revenue streams, though their consideration does not eliminate the progressive nature of overall taxation.|$|E
5|$|Berge Meere und Giganten presciently invokes {{such topics}} as world war, urbanization, the {{alienation}} from nature, mechanization, the dehumanization of the modern world, as well as mass migration, globalization, totalitarianism, fanaticism, terrorism, state surveillance, genetic engineering, synthetic food, the breeding of humans, biochemical warfare, and others. Döblin's experiences during the First World War, when he served in Alsace as a military doctor, left their mark on the novel: psychically damaged veterans, devastated landscapes, and all-destructive technological excesses give this novel its particularly apocalyptic feeling. Because of the bleak {{vision of the future}} that the novel presents, it has often been described by critics as a fundamentally pessimistic, irrationalistic, or <b>regressive</b> work. Hannelore Qual argues against this that Berge Meere und Giganten is instead characterized by an optimistic view of social and historical perfectibility; the portrayals of catastrophic destruction and brutally authoritarian regimes reflect, in this reading, not Döblin's own world view but instead different historical possibilities, alongside which more egalitarian and peaceful social orders are to be found.|$|E
5|$|The average {{ordinary}} {{revenue of}} the republic at this time amounted to between 28 and 35 million guilders. However, since {{the outbreak of the}} war in 1793 the expenditure had been running at between 40 and 55 millions. For the year 1800 the republic had to find 78 million guilders for its expenditures. In other words, the new Agent of Finance, Gogel, was faced with a financial emergency. He needed to generate about 50 million guilders annually in ordinary revenue on a permanent basis urgently. Besides, as the Dutch tax system was heavily skewed toward highly <b>regressive</b> indirect taxes, which inordinately burdened the impoverished population, he wanted to change this to a system that depended more on direct (income and wealth) taxes. Finally, he wanted {{to do away with the}} provincial differentiation in the taxation, and construct a nationally standardized system. When he put these reform proposals to the Representative Assembly on 30 September 1799, they met with massive resistance. This led to so much delay in its acceptance that by the time it was to be implemented (in 1801) the re-federalisation of the state by the new Staatsbewind regime was already underway. Eventually, Gogel's reforms were only implemented under the successor state of the Kingdom of Holland.|$|E
5|$|The {{unitary state}} {{was not an}} end in itself, but a means to higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance {{that had been the}} envy of the world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, so in a sense it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly <b>regressive</b> taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E
25|$|These can in turn {{be either}} <b>regressive</b> or non-regressive. In <b>regressive</b> alterations, the first vowel {{of the second}} {{morpheme}} changes the last vowel of the first morpheme. <b>Regressive</b> assimilations are only conditioned by phonological factors while substitutions take into account semantic information.|$|E
25|$|Illness/Disease (malaria, tuberculosis, AIDS, etc.): Illness imposes {{high and}} <b>regressive</b> cost burdens on {{families}} in developing countries.|$|E
25|$|The Canard was, {{even by the}} {{standards}} of 1910, a curiously <b>regressive</b> design, its layout reminiscent of Alberto Santos-Dumont's 14-bis of 1906.|$|E
25|$|Total assimilation, {{where one}} sound becomes {{identical}} to a neighboring sound, is of two types: progressive, where the assimilated sound becomes {{identical to the}} following sound; and <b>regressive,</b> where it becomes identical to the preceding sound.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} sense, {{it refers to}} any type of long {{distance}} assimilatory process of vowels, either progressive or <b>regressive.</b> When used in this sense, the term vowel harmony is synonymous with the term metaphony.|$|E
25|$|The {{destruction}} of the vegetation implies the {{destruction of}} evoluted soils, or a <b>regressive</b> evolution. Cycles of succession-regression of soils follow one another within short intervals of time (human actions) or long intervals of time (climate variations).|$|E
25|$|Without {{a growing}} and {{inclusive}} economy, and without independent political institutions that work, radical and <b>regressive</b> political bodies are fuelled by the frustration and discontent of citizens {{and are able}} to mobilise people based on their differences, rather than shared values.|$|E
25|$|He also {{coined the}} term <b>Regressive</b> left to denote {{the section of the}} western left which, for the sake of {{political}} correctness and respect for other cultures, excuses, overlooks and sometimes passively encourages illiberal and bigoted ideas emerging from minority communities.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposite}} of a progressive tax is a <b>regressive</b> tax, where the {{effective tax rate}} decreases as the amount to which the rate is applied increases. This effect is commonly produced where means testing is used to withdraw tax allowances or state benefits.|$|E
25|$|Russian {{features}} general <b>regressive</b> {{assimilation of}} voicing and palatalization. In longer clusters, {{this means that}} multiple consonants may be soft despite their underlyingly (and orthographically) being hard. The process of voicing assimilation applies across word-boundaries {{when there is no}} pause between words.|$|E
25|$|Significant {{complications}} to all {{theories are}} {{posed by the}} Old Novgorod dialect, known particularly since the 1950s, which has no application of the second <b>regressive</b> palatalization and only partial application of the progressive palatalization (to *k and sometimes *g, but not to *x).|$|E
25|$|In noun declension, {{the second}} <b>regressive</b> palatalization {{originally}} figured in two important Slavic stem types: o-stems (masculine and neuter consonant-stems) and a-stems (feminine and masculine vowel-stems). This rule operated in the o-stem masculine paradigm in three places: before nominative plural and both singular and plural locative affixes.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the first}} <b>regressive</b> palatalization. Although *g palatalized to an affricate, this soon lenited to a {{fricative}} (but *ždž was retained). Some Germanic loanwords were borrowed early enough {{to be affected by}} the first palatalization. One example is *šelmŭ, from earlier *xelmŭ, from Germanic *helmaz.|$|E
25|$|Although Cain {{has spoken}} about having {{designated}} 'empowerment zones' wherein a lower percentage, such as 3%, is paid instead, apart from this consideration, some have called Cain's plan more <b>regressive</b> than current policy, thinking it would raise taxes for most households, but cut them {{for those with}} the highest income.|$|E
25|$|In {{a process}} called iotation or yodization, *j merged with a {{previous}} consonant (unless it was labial), and those consonants acquired a palatal articulation. Compare English yod-coalescence. This change probably did not occur together with the first <b>regressive</b> palatalization, but somewhat later, and it remained productive well into the Late Common Slavic period.|$|E
25|$|The {{cork oak}} forests often contain wild olives, and {{like some of}} the cool groves, are often {{accompanied}} by strawberry trees (Arbutus unedo) with mock privet (Phillyrea angustifolia) which grow in the clearings of these forests and dominate their <b>regressive</b> phases. In western Andalusia, other common components of the ecosystem are the areas of common broom, genus Teline.|$|E
25|$|A {{lump-sum}} tax is a {{tax that}} is a fixed amount, no matter the change in circumstance of the taxed entity. This in actuality is a <b>regressive</b> tax as those with lower income must use higher percentage of their income than those with higher income and therefore {{the effect of the}} tax reduces as a function of income.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, Silvano Arieti won the American National Book Award in {{the field}} of science for his book, Interpretation of Schizophrenia, which {{advances}} a psychological model for understanding all the <b>regressive</b> types of the disorder. According to more recent research, child abuse at home plays a causal role in depression, PTSD, eating disorders, substance abuse and dissociative disorders.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1986, public {{financing}} {{of health care}} occurred mostly through highly <b>regressive</b> payroll taxes. In 1986, the law that established the Spanish National Health System also shifted financing toward progressive general taxes and away from payroll taxes. In a 2000 report, the World Health Organization ranked Spain 26th of 191 countries in its fairness in financing.|$|E
25|$|Winnicott's {{theoretical}} elusiveness {{has been}} linked to his efforts to modify Kleinian views. But whereas from a Kleinian standpoint, his repudiation of the concepts of envy and the death instinct were a resistant retreat from the harsh realities she had found in infant life, he has also been accused of being too close to Klein: of sharing in her <b>regressive</b> shift of focus away from the Oedipus complex to the pre-oedipal.|$|E
25|$|The {{constitution}} {{mandates that}} taxation must be general and equal in nature, {{and it must}} be proportionate to one's ability to pay. The Federal Supreme Court has interpreted this as prohibiting a <b>regressive</b> tax, although flat rate taxes (as instituted in several cantons) are held to be constitutional by tax law scholars. Moreover, double taxation by several cantons is constitutionally prohibited, as is a confiscatory rate of taxation.|$|E
25|$|In effect, the Target Insulation is a {{ratio of}} 1.33W/m²·K of wall area (Document L 2006). So to keep your square metre warm, you are limited {{as to how much}} power you can use. This is {{slightly}} <b>regressive</b> in that richer people live in bigger houses which tend to have a lower surface area/floor area, although this is partially offset by them being detached, as opposed to, say, terraced.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} feature of tax systems is {{the percentage of the}} tax burden as it relates to income or consumption. The terms progressive, <b>regressive,</b> and proportional are used to describe the way the rate progresses from low to high, from high to low, or proportionally. The terms describe a distribution effect, which can be applied to any type of tax system (income or consumption) that meets the definition.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{reform to}} income tax {{deductions}} allowed high income earners to deduct more for private insurance. Although this reform {{was intended to}} decrease overconsumption of health care services, it had the side effect of more <b>regressive</b> financing of public health services. Nevertheless, that same year payroll taxes were completely phased out while higher indirect taxes (on excise goods such as alcohol and tobacco) were earmarked for health care.|$|E
25|$|A capped {{flat tax}} {{is one in}} which income is taxed at a flat rate until a {{specified}} cap amount is reached. For example, in 2014, the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit of $117,000 of gross compensation (resulting in a maximum Social Security tax of $7,254). This cap has the effect of turning a nominally flat tax into a <b>regressive</b> tax.|$|E
