40|$|This article {{critically}} {{reviews the}} design and methodology of studies aimed at evaluating relapse and recurrence prevention in major depression. A literature search in MEDLINE was performed with the medical subject headings 'depression', 'recurrence', 'relapse', 'prevention' and 'study'. This search covered the period from January 1990 to July 1999. Only long-term placebo-controlled studies that included patients with non-chronic major depression were selected. Two types of design could be distinguished: randomised withdrawal studies in responders/remitters (N = 11) and extension studies in responders without <b>re-randomisation</b> (N = 3). Randomised withdrawal studies are suitable for demonstrating long-term efficacy {{for the duration of}} the study period. However, this design does not permit a clear differentiation between relapse or recurrence and, therefore, is not suitable to demonstrate unequivocally relapse prevention or recurrence prevention. Extension studies in short-term responders without randomisation are not even suitable to demonstrate long-term efficacy. A novel design is proposed that overcomes the weaknesses of designs employed thus far. In essence, this design calls for a long-term randomised placebo-controlled study in patients who are free of medication for a substantial period of time and who fulfil the criteria of major depression (recurrent) in sustained remission (e. g., HDRS < 7) as a possible optio...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this body}} of {{research}} is to determine whether injuries in the home are more common in particular types of housing. Previous home injuries research has {{tended to focus on}} behaviours or the provision of safety equipment to families with young children. There has been little consideration of the physical environment. This study reports methodological developments in database linkage and analysis to improve researchers abilities to utilise large administrative and clinical databases to carry out health and health services research. Methods The study involved linking a database of home injuries obtained from an emergency department surveillance system with an external survey of all homes in an area and population denominators for home types derived from a health service administrative database. Analysis of injury incidence by housing type was adjusted for potential biases due to deprivation and distance to hospital. For non-injured individuals data confidentiality considerations required the deprivation and distance measures be imputed. The process of randomly imputing these variables and the testing of the validity of this approach is detailed. Results There were 14, 081 first injuries in 112, 248 residents living in 54, 081 homes over a two-year period. The imputation method worked well with imputed and observed measures in the injured group being very similar. <b>Re-randomisation</b> and a repeated analysis gave identical results to the first analysis. One particular housing type had a substantially elevated odds ratio for injury occurrence, OR = 2. 07 (95 % CI: 1. 87 to 2. 30). Conclusions The method of data linkage, imputation and statistical analysis used provides a basis for improved analysis of database linkage studies. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background In this study, a multi-parent {{population}} of barley cultivars was {{grown in the}} field for two consecutive years and then straw saccharification (sugar release by enzymes) was subsequently analysed in the laboratory to identify the cultivars with the highest consistent sugar yield. This experiment was used to assess the benefit of accounting for both the multi-phase and multi-environment aspects of large-scale phenotyping experiments with field-grown germplasm through sound statistical design and analysis. Results Complementary designs at both the field and laboratory phases of the experiment ensured that non-genetic sources of variation could be separated from the genetic variation of cultivars, which was the main target of the study. The field phase included biological replication and plot randomisation. The laboratory phase employed <b>re-randomisation</b> and technical replication of samples within a batch, with a subset of cultivars chosen as duplicates that were randomly allocated across batches. The resulting data was analysed using a linear mixed model that incorporated field and laboratory variation and a cultivar by trial interaction, and ensured that the cultivar means were more accurately represented than if the non-genetic variation was ignored. The heritability detected was more than doubled in each year of the trial by accounting for the non-genetic variation in the analysis, clearly showing the benefit of this design and approach. Conclusions The importance of accounting for both field and laboratory variation, as well as the cultivar by trial interaction, by fitting a single statistical model (multi-environment trial, MET, model), was evidenced by the changes in list of the top 40 cultivars showing the highest sugar yields. Failure to account for this interaction resulted in only eight cultivars that were consistently in the top 40 in different years. The correspondence between the rankings of cultivars was much higher at 25 in the MET model. This approach is suited to any multi-phase and multi-environment population-based genetic experiment...|$|E
40|$|In a 12 -month phase 3 {{study in}} {{patients}} with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), TRANSFORMS, fingolimod showed greater efficacy on relapse rates and MRI outcomes compared with interferon beta- 1 a. We had two aims in our extension: to compare year 2 with year 1 in the switched patients to assess {{the effect of a}} change from interferon beta- 1 a to fingolimod, and to compare over 24 months the treatment groups as originally randomised to assess the effect of delaying the start of treatment with fingolimod. METHODS: Patients randomly assigned to receive 0. 5 mg or 1. 25 mg daily oral fingolimod in the core study continued with the same treatment in our extension; patients who originally received 30 μg weekly intramuscular interferon beta- 1 a were randomly reassigned (1 : 1) to receive either 0. 5 mg or 1. 25 mg fingolimod. The initial randomisation and dose of fingolimod assigned for the extension remained masked to the patients and investigators. As in the core study, <b>re-randomisation</b> was done centrally in blocks of six and stratified according to site. Our efficacy endpoints were annualised relapse rate (ARR), disability progression, and MRI outcomes. Our within-group analyses were based on the intention-to-treat and safety populations that entered our extension study. Our between-group analyses were based on the intention-to-treat and safety populations from the core study. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00340834. FINDINGS: 1027 patients entered our extension and received the study drug, and 882 completed 24 months of treatment. Patients receiving continuous fingolimod showed persistent benefits in ARR (0. 5 mg fingolimod [n= 356], 0. 12 [95 % CI 0. 08 - 0. 17] in months 0 - 12 vs 0. 11 [0. 08 - 0. 16] in months 13 - 24; 1. 25 mg fingolimod [n= 330], 0. 15 [0. 10 - 0. 21] vs 0. 11 [0. 08 - 0. 16]; however, in patients who initially received interferon beta- 1 a, ARR was lower after switching to fingolimod compared with the previous 12 months (interferon beta- 1 a to 0. 5 mg fingolimod [n= 167], 0. 31 [95 % CI 0. 22 - 0. 43] in months 0 - 12 vs 0. 22 [0. 15 - 0. 31], in months 13 - 24 p= 0. 049; interferon beta- 1 a to 1. 25 mg fingolimod [n= 174], 0. 29 [0. 20 - 0. 40] vs 0. 18 [0. 12 - 0. 27], p= 0. 024). After switching to fingolimod, numbers of new or newly enlarging T 2 and gadolinium (Gd) -enhancing T 1 lesions were significantly reduced compared with the previous 12 months of interferon beta- 1 a therapy (p< 0. 0001 for T 2 lesions at both doses; p= 0. 002 for T 1 at 0. 5 mg; p= 0. 011 for T 1 at 1. 25 mg), and the pattern of adverse events shifted towards that typical for fingolimod. Over 24 months, in continuous fingolimod groups compared with the group that switched from interferon beta- 1 a to fingolimod, we recorded lower ARRs (0. 18 [95 % CI 0. 14 - 0. 22] for 0. 5 mg; 0. 20 [0. 16 - 0. 25] for 1. 25 mg; 0. 33 [0. 27 - 0. 39] for the switch group; p< 0. 0001 for both comparisons), fewer new or newly enlarged T 2 lesions (p= 0. 035 for 0. 5 mg, p= 0. 068 for 1. 25 mg), and fewer patients with Gd-enhancing T 1 lesions (p= 0. 001 for 0. 5 mg fingolimod vs switch group; p= 0. 002 for 1. 25 mg fingolimod vs switch group). There was no benefit on disability progression. INTERPRETATION: Switching from interferon beta- 1 a to fingolimod led to enhanced efficacy with no unexpected safety concerns. Compared with patients switched from interferon beta- 1 a to fingolimod, continuous treatment with fingolimod for 2 years provides a sustained treatment effect with improved clinical and MRI outcomes.

40|$|Commercial {{sugarcane}} in Australia is harvested {{and subsequently}} crushed over a 20 - 24 week period, typically between June and November. Increases in cane supply placed {{a strain on}} mill capacity, which is expensive to increase. Consequently, extension of the harvesting period was required. Earlier initiation of the harvesting period is the favoured industry option to alleviate mill capacity constraints. However, commercial cane sugar (CCS) levels are usually low {{very early in the}} harvesting season, and this reduces profitability {{at this time of the}} year. Therefore, low CCS early in the harvesting period and immediately before that reduces profitability and is regarded as an industry wide impediment to an earlier initiation of the harvesting period. Various crop management options could assist in addressing low early CCS, but genotypes are expected to play a pivotal role. Breeding research has identified high levels of genetic variation for early CCS, with measurable gains from targeted recurrent selection realised in early stage selection trials. However, current selection systems in industry breeding programs may not fully exploit these gains, particularly in final stage trials. Data on CCS were collected from different series of final stage trials at various predetermined times over random locations and crop-years (Central region), and predetermined times and N rates and random crop-years (Burdekin region). Additionally, cane yield (TCH) was measured twice per year for each location. These data were used to determine if selection systems focused specifically on early (before or during early-July) and mature (after early-July) periods would maximise genetic gain in each of these two sub-target periods (early and mature), as opposed to selection across both sub-periods for broad adaptation. Further, genotype x environment interaction effects, where environments included combinations of sample time, locations, N rates, crop-years, and crop ages, were quantified and their impact on selection decisions within and across the sub-periods established. Genotypes utilised in this research were considered representative of those undergoing assessment in final stage selection trials, after selection from original seedling populations across two previous selection stages. The experimental design involved numerous repeated measures datasets being collected, with the same plot sequentially sampled without <b>re-randomisation.</b> Analyses on such data in sugarcane research published to date have not evaluated alternative covariance and correlation structures between times in the residual matrix of such data. Thus, novel (to sugarcane) covariance structures to model the residual matrix of repeated measures datasets were examined to ensure application of the most appropriate statistical model. However, the choice of covariance structure to model the residual matrix did not impact on estimated best linear unbiased predictors and variance components or their accompanying standard errors. Further, the most parsimonious covariance structure does not estimate pooled residual variance across environments, which is essential for subsequent estimation of heritability and other key breeding parameters (e. g. response to selection). Therefore, a model following a split-block in time ANOVA, assuming a simple covariance structure to model the residual matrix, was considered satisfactory for CCS data collected within and across crop-years, and yield data collected across crop-years. Genotype x time interaction effects on CCS were small compared with genotype main effects, leading to high genetic correlations between times within each sub-period (early and mature). However, genetic correlations for sample times &# 8805; 16 weeks apart were considerably lower, and sample times within locations generally clustered according to sub-period (early vs. mature). However, genotype x sub-period interaction effects on CCS and TCH were not important across random locations and crop-years in the Central region, or fixed N rates and random crop-years in the Burdekin region, because a large portion of total genotype x environment interaction effects were retained within each sub-period. Therefore, subdivision of a selection program into two components, focused on early (pre-July) and mature (July and after) would not significantly enhance genetic gains. However, as genetic variance and response to selection were greatest during the early sub-period, an advantage in overall genetic gain would be realised if final stage trials were assessed early in the harvesting period. For the Central region, the results indicated that final stage trials should be assessed over multiple locations and crop-years, but with only one sample time per crop-year required for measurement of CCS and TCH. In the Burdekin region, significant genotype x N rate interaction effects influenced selection for TCH (especially in ratoon crops), but not CCS. Some of the genotype x N rate interaction effects were attributed to increased lodging, which increased with applied N. The genotype x N rate interaction effects were mainly due to divergent genotype performance for the lowest compared to recommended (or higher) N rates. These results are of practical significance in that they highlight the importance of maintaining adequate levels of N in selection trials, with the medium N rate (corresponding to current industry recommended rates of application) providing optimal growers returns. Direct selection for genotype performance at recommended rates of N fertilizer was found to be optimal. Construction of managed environments by lowering N rates to reduce lodging and possibly decrease error variation would be inappropriate because the genetic correlation between the low and medium N rates was near zero. However, the combination of small genotype x time interaction and unimportant genotype x crop age interaction effects on CCS indicated that effective selection for CCS in final stage trials could occur early in the year at a young crop age, prior to lodging. Overall, the results indicated that final stage trials do not have to be conducted in each of two sub-periods (early and mature) to optimise gains from selection. However, selection gains would be maximised by selection based on CCS measured relatively early in the harvesting season. Conducting final stage trials across multiple locations and crop-years is important because of large genotype interactions with these factors. Recommended rates of N fertilizer should be applied with particular care to avoid sub-optimal levels of N...|$|E
