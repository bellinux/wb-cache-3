5000|$|A Charvet {{fabric is}} woven of silk or acetate in warp-faced <b>rib</b> <b>weave,</b> of a {{reversed}} reps type {{with a double}} ridge effect. The fabric's name derives from its frequent and [...] "clever" [...] use in the 19th century by the Parisian shirtmaker Charvet. It {{is characterized by a}} soft handle and shiny appearance. It also drapes well. The bindings create a herringbone effect parallel to the warp, which make this weave suitable for creating faint diagonal stripe effects for ties, for which the fabric is cut on the bias. Patterns on this base are often made with supplementary weft. The fabric has also been used for mufflers, scarves and robes.|$|E
40|$|Windbreak Net is an {{extremely}} important facility of prevention of wind damage; however, windbreak net's function varies with different types; hence, the research's main purpose was to compare the differences of shelter effect with diverse windbreak net weaving types. The research adopted three types of windbreak nets of higher market share in Taiwan: plain weave, knitted weave, which had two different mesh shapes, and <b>ribbed</b> <b>weave,</b> which had two varied weaving methods. The wind tunnel test was conducted with these five sets of windbreak net, and relative wind velocity, wind velocity reduction coefficient, protection index, and economic benefit were used respectively to do comparison and make analysis to {{explore the influence of}} weaving type, mesh number and shape on wind velocity reduction effect. The test results showed that when all windbreaks had the same ventilation rate, the windbreak net of plain weave had the best shelter effect, the secondary was <b>ribbed</b> <b>weave,</b> and the worst was knitted weave; however, if both the shading and anti-insect functions were required, the windbreak net of knitted weave type was relatively more ideal to choose; yet if taking economic benefit into consideration, the windbreak net of <b>ribbed</b> <b>weave</b> was the cheapest. As for the mesh shape, triangle had better shelter effect than rectangle, and in this research case, mesh number had no significant difference in wind velocity reduction. 防風網是風害防治極為重要之設施，然而防風網之功能因其形式不同而異；因此，本試驗主要目的即在於比較防風網編織形式對減風功效之差異，研究中採用國內市占率較高之平織、針織及羅紋織三種形式防風網，其中針織有兩種不同網目形狀，而羅紋織則有兩種不同編織方式，將此五組防風網，進行風洞試驗，分別以相對風速、減風係數、保護指數及經濟效益比較分析，探討編織形式、網目數量及形狀對減風效果之影響。經試驗結果顯示，當透風率相同時，在減風功效方面，以平織形式之防風網最佳，羅紋織次之、針織最差；然而若需兼具遮陽及防蟲功效，則應選用針織形式之防風網較為理想；但若考量經濟效益，則又以羅紋織防風網最為價廉。至於網目形狀以三角形比矩形有較佳之減風功效，而網目數量在本試驗個案中，對於減風並無明顯差異...|$|R
50|$|The fabric {{whipcord}} is {{a strong}} worsted or cotton fabric made of hard-twisted yarns with a diagonal cord or <b>rib.</b> The <b>weave</b> used for whipcord is a steep-angled twill, essentially the same weave as a cavalry twill or a steep gabardine. However, the ribs of whipcord are usually more pronounced than in either of those fabrics, and the weft (filling) may be visible between the ribs on the right side, which is usually {{not the case for}} gabardines. In practice, marketing considerations, rather than technical details, determine when the specific term whipcord is used.|$|R
6000|$|Over {{our heads}} bend the great arrow leaves and purple leafstalks of the Tanias; {139b} and mingled with them, leaves often larger still: [...] oval, glossy, bright, ribbed, {{reflecting}} from their underside a silver light. They belong to Arumas; {139c} {{and from their}} <b>ribs</b> are <b>woven</b> the Indian baskets and packs. Above these, again, the Balisiers bend their long leaves, eight or ten feet long apiece; and {{under the shade of}} the leaves their gay flower-spikes, like double rows of orange and black birds' beaks upside down. Above them, and among them, rise stiff upright shrubs, with pairs of pointed leaves, a foot long some of them, pale green above, and yellow or fawn- coloured beneath. You may see, by the three longitudinal nerves in each leaf, that they are Melastomas of different kinds--a sure token they that you are in the Tropics--a probable token that you are in Tropical America.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{necessity}} of using renewable resources and sustainable solutions in the building sector has become obvious, and interest in timber as a building material has revived. Novel timber-derived products, such as massif block panels, have emerged {{and the use of}} such products is spreading. The IBOIS research concerns {{the development of a new}} generation of timber constructions, made out of innovative timber-derived products, derived by applying textile principles on a building scale. It aims at the unprecedented exploration and study of timber related structures and their structural analyses within a framework integrating the mechanical and structural principles of textiles. The validity of this approach is based on the fact that both, wood and fabrics, are fibre-based tissues. Since timber can be viewed as a fibre-derived product it follows that the analogy between micro scale fibre structures and timber-derived wooden structures can be explored at micro-and macro-scale. The concise observation of existing textile techniques and fabrication methods combined with investigation lines such as textiles, mathematical descriptions, study of timber <b>rib</b> shells, <b>woven</b> wood fabrics, architectural and structural applications, digita...|$|R
40|$|Weight {{reduction}} using composites {{has gained}} increasing attention in recent times. In this study, pultruded composite pins (unconfined and confined) were manufactured and tested by using a custom double shear testing fixture. Different configurations were applied for confinement of the composite pins, including weft-knitted fabrics (plain, 1 × 1 <b>rib,</b> and Milano), <b>woven</b> fabrics and E-glass 130 tex fibers/adhesive cloth. They were externally wrapped and bonded to the unconfined composite pins. In each case, five identical specimens were tested, and shear strength data were analyzed by using two-parameter Weibull statistics. The {{results showed that the}} maximum shear strength took its highest value in the unconfined case for both average values of the test results and for 99 % reliability under Weibull distribution. The confinement had a negative effect on the average shear strength of the unconfined pins. It was also seen that the 99 % reliability values of shear strength were approximately equivalent to the 0. 7 average value of the shear strength.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{understand}} the stick-slip properties of dry polyester plain, <b>ribs</b> and satin <b>woven</b> fabric weaves. It was found that the amount of stick-slip force was related to the number of interlacement points in the fabric, whereas the amount of accumulative retraction force was related to fabric structural response. Stick-slip force and accumulative retraction force depend on fabric weave, fabric density, the number of pulled ends in the fabric and fabric sample dimensions. The weft directional single and multiple yarn stick-slip and accumulative retraction forces of dry plain fabrics in fabric edge and centre regions were higher than those in the satin fabric due to fabric weave. In addition, the warp directional single and multiple yarn stick-slip and accumulative retraction forces in the meso-cell- 1 to the meso-cell- 6 of dry wide and long satin fabric in fabric edge were higher than those in the weft direction due to fabric density. Stick-slip and accumulative retraction forces of polyester fabric in the multiple yarn pull-out test were higher than those of the single yarn pull-out test...|$|R
