50|$|The {{booking office}} was robbed on 7 December 1868 when thieves drilled through the ticket window {{covering}} with a <b>bit</b> and <b>brace,</b> {{and stole a}} small amount of cash.|$|R
25|$|These bits are {{available}} both in a version similar to an auger <b>bit</b> or <b>brace</b> <b>bit,</b> designed for low speed, high torque use with a brace or other hand drill (pictured to the right), or {{as a high}} speed, low torque bit meant for a power drill. While {{the shape of the}} cutting edges is different, and one uses screw threads and the other a twist bit for the pilot, the method of adjusting them remains the same.|$|R

50|$|Also in June 2012, Survivors of Symphysiotomy testified {{publicly}} {{before the}} Joint Oireachtas (Select) Committee on Justice. Catherine McKeever, a private patient at the Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda in 1969, told the Committee {{that she did}} not realise what had happened: 'I saw him doctor with an instrument which I thought was a <b>bit</b> <b>brace</b> because my father was a wood turner. I felt a crack … Nobody answered me or said anything'. Margaret Conlan, who was operated upon in 1962 in St Finbarr's Hospital, Cork, testified that she had never been told anything about it: 'My baby’s head was perforated and the baby died… I did not find out the symphysiotomy until I read it in the newspaper'.|$|R
50|$|The company {{became one}} of the nation's largest {{wholesale}} enterprises with nationally known quality brands, among which Blue Grass was the most readily recognizable. John Primble knives, developed by an employee of the company, became a Belknap brand with its own division, made in Louisville between 1947 and 1985 by the John Primble Belknap Hardware Co. The Crusader manufacturing brand of Belknap included contractors' shovels, hammers, hatchets, axes, drawing knives, carpenters' pincers, planes, screw drivers, hand drills, wrecking bars, <b>bit</b> <b>braces,</b> auger <b>bits,</b> chisels, pliers, wrenches, tin snips, and tin ceilings. Other popular Belknap manufactured products included rifles, guns, padlocks, lawn mowers, and bicycles. Belknap inventory in the vast warehouse spaces grew larger and larger, and the Belknap neon sign could be seen from miles away.|$|R
5000|$|Gradually {{business}} {{grew and}} became more diversified, the Post-Office Glasgow Annual Directory recording that by 1847/8 Alexander Mathieson was a [...] "plane, <b>brace,</b> <b>bit,</b> auger & edge-tool maker".|$|R

25|$|The {{diameter}} of auger <b>bits</b> for hand <b>braces</b> is commonly expressed {{by a single}} number, indicating the size in 16ths of an inch. For example, #4 is 4/16 or 1/4in (6mm), #6 is 6/16 or 3/8in (9mm), #9 is 9/16in (14mm), and #16 is 16/16 or 1in (25mm). Sets commonly consist of #4-16 or #4-10 bits.|$|R

25|$|Spoon bits are the {{traditional}} boring tools {{used with a}} brace. They should never be used with a power drill of any kind. Their key advantage over regular <b>brace</b> <b>bits</b> and power drill bits is that {{the angle of the}} hole can be adjusted. This is very important in chairmaking, because all the angles are usually eyeballed. Another advantage is {{that they do not have}} a lead screw, so they can be drilled successfully in a chair leg without having the lead screw peek out the other side.|$|R
5000|$|As the 20th century progressed {{they began}} to focus on hand tools and {{eventually}} become a sizeable player in the hand tool industry. Originally focusing on spiral ratchet and [...] "plain" [...] screwdrivers they soon expanded to various types of hand tools and eventually became a significant force in the tool industry. Eventually the success of the Yankee line of tools led the Stanley Works tool company to acquire the North Bros. in 1946, chiefly to improve their own product lines. Stanley was primarily interested in their <b>bit</b> and <b>brace</b> designs, which continued to be produced unchanged at Stanley for decades, and the spiral ratchet [...] " [...] Yankee" [...] screwdrivers. The North Bros. name lived on at Stanley into the 1950s before finally being phased out. The Yankee name continued to be used by Stanley up until the early 2000s before they sold it to the Schroeder tool company. As of 2013 Schroeder of Germany continues to sell [...] "Yankee" [...] branded screwdrivers and push drills.|$|R
5000|$|North Bros. key {{acquisition}} was {{the hiring}} of Zachary Furbish when it purchased the Forest City Screwdriver Co in 1897. He brought with him patents related to a spiral ratchet screw driver and considerable experience in tool design. This was their foothold into the tool manufacturing industry which would later become the core of their business. Furbish alone would eventually amass 30 patents related to hand tools produced by North Bros., despite passing away in 1906, and his designs would become the backbone of their product lines for years to come. North Bros. tool brand was called Yankee, much like how Sears tools are branded Craftsman, and every tool they sold sported this trademark. In later years the [...] Yankee name would become synonymous with the spiral ratchet screw driver invented by Furbish but it was originally seen on everything from bench vises to cutting tools. Building upon the line of tools originally made by Forest City, North Bros. soon expanded their selection of offerings. Screwdrivers were joined by push drills, breast drills, hand drills (also called egg beater drills), hand powered bench drills, <b>bit</b> and <b>braces,</b> <b>ratcheting</b> tap wrenches, vises, cutting tools and small tool kits.|$|R
5000|$|Parker is a {{reformed}} criminal, having served prison sentences for cat burglary and safecracking. His criminal exploits, {{coupled with a}} prominent facial feature, earned him the nickname [...] "Nosey" [...] (this {{may also be a}} reference to his nosiness - he eavesdrops on his employer's conversations in [...] "Vault of Death" [...] and Thunderbird 6). He was rescued from a life of crime by Penelope, who recruited him as an aide in her espionage activities. Parker's underworld contacts frequently prove useful during the pair's missions (such as in [...] "The Cham-Cham", when he blackmails a talent agent to have an undercover Penelope pass off as a nightclub singer). It is revealed in [...] "The Cham-Cham" [...] that Parker suffers from vertigo. In the episode [...] "The Man from MI.5" [...] it is revealed he still has the temptation to return to his burglar ways as he was caught with a suitcase full of safecracking equipment, much to Penelope's chagrin. He later complained to himself about the situation, saying [...] "'Ow she expects me to keep my 'and in I don't know". He is very [...] "old school" [...] in the ways of safecracking, as the equipment consisted of a brick, various wrenches, a <b>bit</b> and <b>brace</b> etc. In [...] "Vault of Death" [...] he is shown to use a stethoscope instead of a modern detector. He stated that it was good enough for his father, his grandfather and his great-grandfather. This implies that cat burglary and safecracking were a family business and probably explains where he got his skills. In the same episode it is revealed Parker knew a fellow burglar nicknamed [...] "light-fingered Fred" [...] when he was in prison and he further claimed that Fred {{was the only one who}} could possibly rival him in the skills of his criminal expertise. It is revealed in the episode [...] "Danger at Ocean Deep" [...] that he has an upper-class connoisseur-like taste for fine beverages as he manages to pilfer a bottle of vintage 1998 champagne, right under Penelope's nose no less, and swap it with pure tonic water without her knowing anything. During the launching of the ship he and another fellow chauffeur, a friend named Stevens, share in drinking the entire bottle together. Penelope later finds Parker asleep and hiccupping. A slurring Parker then (drunkenly) reveals his theft. He says he did this on the grounds that it was such a good year it seemed a shame to see it go to waste.|$|R
