Initially, it consisted simply of a reproduction of the title pages from several hundred major peer-reviewed scientific journals, and was published weekly, with the issues containing title pages from journal issues only a few weeks previously, a shorter time lag than any service then available. There was an author index and a crude keyword subject index only. Author addresses were provided so readers could send <b>reprint</b> <b>requests</b> for copies of the actual articles.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{discourse}} community is proposed {{as a more}} functional and goal-directed grouping than either speech community or speech fellowship. Six criteria {{for the existence of}} a discourse community are outlined and then exemplified.

The second half of this paper examines, by way of application of the theoretical discussion, the genre of the <b>reprint</b> <b>request,</b> and discusses the discourse communities that either do or do not participate in the genre.

40|$|Online <b>reprint</b> <b>request</b> (ORR) is the {{standard}} protocol to obtain the reprints (e-print/hard copy) using the internet (author&#x 2032;s e-mail address) when the required literature is not available. The problem of higher cost of surface mail for the author and the reader, {{as well as the}} time taken to receive postal reprints, is overcome by ORR. This technique has its limitation in message failure, expiration of mail (e-mail decay), or journal not providing author&#x 2032;s e-mail address. This article analyzes the available practical solution to overcome these barriers. This process facilitates the exchange of scientific information. In e-mail decay, <b>reprint</b> <b>request</b> can be sent in the following order: a) search and send to author&#x 2032;s latest e-mail address, b) co-author&#x 2032;s latest or affiliated institution&#x 2032;s e-mail address, c) postal <b>reprint</b> <b>request</b> providing the requestor&#x 2032;s e-mail address. This protocol can be practiced when library facilities or required literature is not available.

40|$|Nine hundred ninety-four <b>reprint</b> <b>requests</b> {{were made}} for almost all the {{original}} articles that appeared in five pediatric journals between August and October in 1985, 1986, and 1987.

A total of 636 (64 %) reprints were received within 6 months of mailing the request. The return rates for reprints solicited by form letters and preprinted cards were 68 % and 60 %, respectively. The response to <b>reprint</b> <b>requests</b> was greater for more recent articles.

40|$|Prevalence of {{serological}} markers for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) among {{a sample}} of female patients receiving dental treatment at the College of Dentistry, King Saud University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN: Patients who were receiving dental treatment by students {{for at least three}} successive visits and had no past history of viral hepatitis were screened for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis C viral antibodies (HCV). RESULTS: One hundred fifty-fivepatientsparticipatedinthisstudy. Fivepatients(3. 2 %) aged 23 - 53 years were found hepatitis markers seropositive. Two patients (1. 3 %) were HBsAg seropositive and three patients (1. 9 %) were anti-HCV seropositive. CONCLUSIONS: Taking medical history without screening blood test for HBV and HCV might lead to treating infected patients as non infected ones. This increases the risk of hepatitis cross infection unless strict adherence to standard precautions in dental setting is followed.

Surgical intervention is recommended in such cases; however, success is dependent on correct diagnosis and precise localization of leak site. Imaging plays a very essential and indispensable role. Imaging also plays {{a very important role}} in identifying the cause of leak and planning surgery. The radiological investigations used in evaluation of CSF rhinorrhea evolved over time from simple tests to very sophisticated and highly accurate procedures. Correct diagnosis and localization of leak depends on proper selection and adequate technique of radiological examinations. Sound knowledge in the current radiological investigations for CSF rhinorrhea, including the yield, indications, contraindications, complications, and selection, is essential for both treating physician and radiologist...|$|R
40|$|To whom <b>reprint</b> <b>request</b> {{should be}} sent The {{possible}} role of oxygen radicals in mediating the cyto-pathologic effects of asbestos was studied using human meso-thelial cells in culture. Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements of intact cells using the spin trap 5, 5 -dimethj 1 - 1 -pyrroline-l-oxide failed to detect any increase in oxygen radicals in mesothelial cells after exposure to amosite asbestos, although oxygen radicals were readily detected in cells ex-posed to menadione, an uncoupler of oxidation â reduction reactions. Cellular thiol levels were reduced after exposure to menadione, but were not affected by exposure to asbestos. Addition to the culture media of the free radical scavengers superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione, A'-acetylcysteine, or D-a-tocopherol had no affect on the dose-dependent cyto-toxicity of amosite fibers. Furthermore, exposure of the meso-thelial cells to amosite fibers resulted in no {{significant increase in the}} level of DNA single-strand breaks. These results all suggest that for cultured human mesothelial cells, oxygen free radicals are not important mediators of the cytopathic ef-fect of asbestos...|$|R
