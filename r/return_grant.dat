Grant {{was able to get}} Congress in January, 1871 to create a special Commission to investigate the island. Senator Sumner continued to vigorously oppose and speak out against annexation. Grant appointed Frederick Douglass, an African American civil rights activist, as one of the Commissioners who voyaged to the Dominican Republic. Returning to the United States after several months, the Commission in April 1871, issued a report that stated the Dominican people desired annexation and that the island would be beneficial to the United States. [...] To celebrate the Commissions <b>return,</b> <b>Grant</b> invited the Commissioners to the White House, except Frederick Douglass. African American leaders were upset and the issue of Douglass not being invited to the White House dinner was brought up during the 1872 Presidential election by Horace Greeley. Douglas, however, who was personally disappointed for not being invited to the White House, remained loyal to Grant and the Republican Party. Although the Commission supported Grant's annexation attempt, there was not enough enthusiasm in Congress to vote on a second annexation treaty.|$|E

5000|$|Marj finally {{originated}} a soap role as {{the evil}} Vanessa Bennett on All My Children from 1999-2002. As the mother of Dr. David Hayward (Vincent Irizarry, her co-star from Guiding Light) and Leo DuPres (Josh Duhamel), she also became Palmer Cortlandt's last wife, giving her another legendary leading man in James Mitchell. After Vanessa's supposed demise after she was revealed to be a drug lord, Marj was persuaded {{to come back to}} the show, this time replacing Joan Collins, who left three months into a six-month contract. In late May 2005, Dusay was one of several cast members taken off contract due to budget cuts. The show later asked her to remain with the show on recurring status. Because of her popularity in the role, Marj was given a front-burner storyline in 2006 that had Alexandra marrying a younger man to keep him in the country and scheming to keep him out of a younger woman's bed. While her appearances were greatly reduced after this story ended, she began appearing more upon the <b>return</b> <b>Grant</b> Aleksander (Philip Spaulding) in 2009. CBS announced that Guiding Light was being cancelled on April 1, 2009, with the last show set to air in September. She appeared in Guiding Light's final episode, which aired on September 18, 2009.

40|$|We used Spitzer and its IRAC {{camera to}} search for the transit of the super-Earth HD 40307 b. The {{hypothesis}} that the planet transits could not be firmly discarded from our first photometric monitoring of a transit window because of the uncertainty coming from the modeling of the photometric baseline. To obtain a firm result, two more transit windows were observed and a global Bayesian analysis of the three IRAC time series and the HARPS radial velocities was performed. Unfortunately, the hypothesis that the planet transited during the observed phase window is firmly rejected, while the probability that the planet does transit but that the eclipse was missed by our observations is nearly negligible (0. 26 %).

40|$|Recently, a new {{paradigm}} for cognitive radio networks has been advocated, where primary users (PUs) recruit the secondary users (SUs) to cooperatively relay the primary traffic, and in <b>return</b> <b>grant</b> the SUs the right to access the channel. However, all existing work on such cooperative cognitive radio networks (CCRNs) operate in the temporal domain only, which limits the performance of both PUs and SUs. On the other hand, Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) enables transmission of multiple independent data streams in the spatial domain to improve capacity. Taking advantage of the MIMO technique in CCRNs is an unexplored area that we investigate in this paper. We propose a novel MIMO-CCRN framework, which enables the SUs to utilize MIMO techniques to cooperatively relay the traffic for the PUs, while concurrently accessing the same channel to transmit their own traffic. Specifically, we consider two typical network scenarios. For {{the case of a}} general PU link and multiple SUs, we provide theoretical analysis for the link rates and then formulate an optimization model based on a Stackelberg game to maximize the utilities of PUs and SUs. In addition, we extend our analysis to a practical cellular network with multiple MIMO-empowered femtocells, and provide an algorithm to find a stable matching of the PUs and SUs. Evaluation results show that high utility gains are achieved by both PUs and SUs by leveraging MIMO spatial cooperation in our proposed framework...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{scenario}} where massive primordial black holes (PBHs) are produced from the collapse of large curvature perturbations generated during a mild-waterfall phase of hybrid inflation. We determine {{the values of the}} inflaton potential parameters leading to a PBH mass spectrum peaking on planetarylike masses at matter-radiation equality and producing abundances comparable to those of dark matter today, while the matter power spectrum on scales probed by cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies agrees with Planck data. These PBHs could have acquired large stellar masses today, via merging, and the model passes both the constraints from CMB distortions and microlensing. This scenario is supported by Chandra observations of numerous BH candidates in the central region of Andromeda. Moreover, the tail of the PBH mass distribution could be responsible for the seeds of supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies, as well as for ultraluminous x-ray sources. We find that our effective hybrid potential can originate e. g. from D-term inflation with a Fayet-Iliopoulos term of the order of the Planck scale but sub-Planckian values of the inflaton field. Finally, we discuss the implications of quantum diffusion at the instability point of the potential, able to generate a Swiss-cheese-like structure of the Universe, eventually leading to apparent accelerated cosmic expansionThe work of S.

40|$|Understanding the {{mechanism}} of resistance of genes to reactivation will help improve the success of nuclear reprogramming. Using mouse embryonic fibroblast nuclei with normal or reduced DNA methylation in combination with chromatin modifiers able to erase H 3 K 9 me 3, H 3 K 27 me 3, and H 2 AK 119 ub 1 from transplanted nuclei, we reveal the basis for resistance of genes to transcriptional reprogramming by oocyte factors. A majority of genes is affected {{by more than one}} type of treatment, suggesting that resistance can require repression through multiple epigenetic mechanisms. We classify resistant genes according to their sensitivity to 11 chromatin modifier combinations, revealing the existence of synergistic as well as adverse effects of chromatin modifiers on removal of resistance. We further demonstrate that the chromatin modifier USP 21 reduces resistance through its H 2 AK 119 deubiquitylation activity. Finally, we provide evidence that H 2 A ubiquitylation also contributes to resistance to transcriptional reprogramming in mouse nuclear transfer embryos.
