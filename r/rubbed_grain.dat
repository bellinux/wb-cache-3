60|$|They {{certainly}} did so, for more bear steaks were {{laid on the}} embers, and while one of the newcomers, stripping a cartridge, <b>rubbed</b> powder <b>grains</b> into the flesh another produced {{a few of the}} fern roots which in times of scarcity the Siwash Indians eat. When at last they had finished, one of the party, pushing back his fur cap, turned to me.|$|R
5000|$|As an {{important}} part of his job, the miller repeatedly takes into his hand samples of the ground meal coming out of the spout in order to feel the quality and character of the product. The miller <b>rubs</b> the <b>grain</b> between his thumb and forefinger. After years of doing this the miller's thumb changes shape and becomes broad and flattened. This is known as a [...] "miller's thumb".|$|R

6000|$|... ‘Which again, naturally, <b>rubs</b> {{against the}} <b>grain</b> of Mr. Bazzard,’ said Mr. Grewgious. ‘He is very short with me sometimes, and then I {{feel that he}} is meditating, “This {{blockhead}} is my master! A fellow who couldn’t write a tragedy on pain of death, and who will never have one dedicated to him with the most complimentary congratulations on the high position he has taken {{in the eyes of}} posterity!” Very trying, very trying. However, in giving him directions, I reflect beforehand: “Perhaps he may not like this,” or “He might take it ill if I asked that;” and so we get on very well. Indeed, better than I could have expected.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Tim Keenan {{stepped in}} and bent over Cherokee, fondling him {{on both sides of}} the {{shoulders}} with hands that <b>rubbed</b> against the <b>grain</b> of the hair and that made slight, pushing-forward movements. These were so many suggestions. Also, their effect was irritating, for Cherokee began to growl, very softly, deep down in his throat. There was a correspondence in rhythm between the growls and the movements of the man's hands. The growl rose in the throat with the culmination of each forward-pushing movement, and ebbed down to start up afresh with the beginning of the next movement. The end of each movement was the accent of the rhythm, the movement ending abruptly and the growling rising with a jerk.|$|R
6000|$|... "No! No! No! Listen now to what I {{had to say}} without {{interrupting}} me again: All {{this about}} the villages, viewed from up there where the lark sings, is but a preliminary--a little play to deceive yourself and me. For, {{all the time you}} are thinking of other things, serious and some exceedingly sad--of those who live not in villages but in dreadful cities, who are like motherless men who have never known a mother's love and have never had a home on earth. And you are like one who has come upon a cornfield, ripe for the harvest with you alone to reap it. And viewing it you pluck an ear of corn, and <b>rub</b> the <b>grains</b> out in the palm of your hand, and toss them up, laughing and playing with them like a child, pretending you are thinking of nothing, yet all the time thinking--thinking of the task before you. And presently you will take to the reaping and reap until the sun goes down, to begin again at sunrise to toil and sweat again until evening. Then, lifting your bent body with pain and difficulty, you will look to see how little you have done, and that the field has widened and now stretches away before you to the far horizon. And in despair you will cast the sickle away and abandon the task." ...|$|R
40|$|We need {{to rethink}} {{graffiti}}: they are not just words and images but places and things. Using the graffiti of Dura-Europos on the Syrian Euphrates, this paper will demonstrate {{some of the ways}} that the ‘unofficial’ urban texts of antiquity can, when studied in their spatial context as material objects, elucidate urban histories which <b>rub</b> against the <b>grain</b> of traditional studies. It will explore the ways such seemingly ephemeral marks can be active agents within the urban environment in public, religious, and private contexts. It argues for a new definition for graffiti related to context and immediacy. Graffiti, I contend, have the potential to give new perspectives on the ancient world: they are unmediated traces, stories of daily life, and through them it is possible to explore the ways the walls of the city could become active in people’s lives. At Dura, the small scratched messages of an otherwise historically voiceless people made on a plaster wall can be read almost two millennia later...|$|R
40|$|Human CO 2 {{emissions}} may {{drive the}} Earth into a next greenhouse state. They can be mitigated by accelerating weathering of natural rock under the uptake of CO 2. We disprove the paradigm that olivine weathering in nature {{would be a}} slow process, and show {{that it is not}} needed to mill olivine to very fine, 10 μm-size grains in order to arrive at a complete dissolution within 1 – 2 year. In high-energy shallow marine environments olivine grains and reaction products on the grain surfaces, that otherwise would greatly retard the reaction, are abraded so that the chemical reaction is much accelerated. When kept in motion even large olivine <b>grains</b> <b>rubbing</b> and bumping against each other quickly produce fine clay- and silt-sized olivine particles that show a fast chemical reaction. Spreading of olivine in the world's 2 % most energetic shelf seas can compensate a year's global CO 2 emissions and counteract ocean acidification against a price well below that of carbon credit...|$|R
5000|$|To begin with, Leo {{moved to}} Apulia, {{and reached the}} Fortore River {{near the city of}} Civitate (or Civitella, {{northwest}} of Foggia). The Normans went forth to intercept the Papal army near Civitella and prevent its union with the Byzantine army, led by Argyrus. The Normans were short on supplies because of the harvest season, and had fewer men than their enemies, with no more than 3,000 horsemen and 500 infantry against 6,000 horsemen and infantry. Both Amatus' account and William of Apulia agree that the Normans were suffering from hunger and lack of nutrition, and both also add that the Normans forces were in fact so lacking that they, [...] "by the example of the Apostles took the heads of <b>grain,</b> <b>rubbed</b> them in their hands, and ate the kernels," [...] some may have cooked them over the fire beforehand as well. [...] Because of this, the Normans were driven to ask for a truce, but were refused, though there is some disagreement on who the greater enemies of the Normans were in refusing the negotiations, varying between the Lombards, the Germans, and the curia of Pope Leo himself, whom the Normans in fact wish to swear their fidelitas.|$|R
5000|$|On November 22, Clark {{independently}} released 'Patterns' [...] on her label One Small Instrument Records. Buffalo News reviewed it {{as having}} [...] "Dreamy pop with folk roots. Clark is the genuine article, a deeply talented songwriter and record maker with a gorgeous voice. 'Patterns' is beautifully produced, and is crammed full of deft, subtle harmonic and sonic touches. Smart, sexy, and sometimes, simply sublime." [...] ITunes reviewed it as [...] "overflowing {{with all kinds}} of charm. The opener, [...] "Lose My Mind," [...] sets the tone with a perfect blend of indie and pop, as retro-sounding synthesizers work their way around percolating beats while Clark's cooing vocals melt over a catchy chorus. The following [...] "Days into Nights" [...] is less busy; it gives Clark plenty of room to stretch her vocal range, especially in the wide-open refrain where her notes soar outward. Old-school drum and bass textures pepper the comforting [...] "Sign," [...] where her breathy inflections wash over the listener. The innovatively arranged [...] "Decimals and Music Notes" [...] moves with unpredictable changes that <b>rub</b> against the <b>grain</b> of her smooth and simple vocal style. It's refreshing to hear a songstress confidently come into her own style, most noticeably in [...] "Breathe," [...] where the sole accompaniment of an acoustic guitar really lets you home in on her lovely voice.".|$|R
40|$|Raw Histories is {{concerned}} with historical photographs in anthropology. Rather than seeing them merely as ideologically formulated products of colonial gaze and appropriative desire, it explores photographs as cultural objects which inscribe multiple and contested histories in cross-cultural environments, including those of complex and unstable colonial relations. The book argues throughout that photographs are not merely ‘of things’ but {{are part of this}} dynamic and fluid historical dialogue. Such a strategy allows alternative historical voices, counter-narratives and strategies to emerge. Taking the nature of photography itself as the starting point, the book was the first to employ the concepts of ‘social life’, ‘biography’, ‘material culture’ and ‘performance’ to historical cross-cultural photographs. Such an approach facilitates a clearer understanding of both the multi-layered and intersecting demands placed on photographs over space and time. The title of the book reflects these fluidities: photographs are ‘raw’, it is argued, in that they have an uncontainability, resistance and unknowability, and ‘raw’ because the histories brought into focus by such an approach are sometimes uncomfortable, painful and <b>rub</b> against the <b>grain.</b> Divided into three sections ‘Notes from the Archive’, ‘Historical Inscriptions’ and ‘Reworkings’, these key theoretical strands are explored through a series of case studies, based on detailed and original archival and institutional research. They range from the making of ‘the archive’ as a cultural object, through re-workings of colonial images from the Pacific, to the way the dynamics of the photographs and the issues around them have been engaged with by contemporary artists and curators...|$|R
