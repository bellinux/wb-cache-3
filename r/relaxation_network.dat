To demonstrate its utility, {{the model is}} applied to the speech recognition domain. Traditional speech recognition systems typically consider only that context preceding the word to be recognized.

40|$|A Lagrangian <b>relaxation</b> <b>network</b> for graph {{matching}} is presented. The {{problem is}} formulated as follows: given graphs ¢ ¡ and, find a permutation matrix {{that brings the}} two sets of vertices into correspondence. Permutation matrix constraints are formulated in the framework of deterministic annealing. Our approach is in the same spirit as a Lagrangian decomposition approach in that the row and column constraints are satisfied separately with a Lagrange multiplier used to equate the two “solutions. ” Due to the unavoidable symmetries in graph isomorphism (resulting in multiple global minima), we add a symmetry-breaking self-amplification term in order to obtain a permutation matrix. With the application of a fixpoint preserving algebraic transformation to both the distance measure and self-amplification terms, we obtain a Lagrangian <b>relaxation</b> <b>network.</b> The network performs min-imization with respect to the Lagrange parameters and maximization with respect to the permutation matrix variables.

In this paper we consider a class of associative inference to which marker passing is often applied, variously called abductive inference, schema selection, or pattern completion. Analysis of marker semantics in a standard semantic net representation leads to a proposal for more strictly regulated marker propagation.

40|$|Abstract. Many visual tasks {{depend upon}} the {{interpretation}} of visual structures that are flow fields, such as optical flow, oriented texture, and shading. The computation of these visual flows involves a delicate tradeoff: imaging imperfections lead to noisy and sparse initial flow measurements, necessitating further processing to infer dense coherent flows; this processing typically entails interpolation and smoothing, {{both of which are}} prone to destroy visual flow discontinuities. However, discontinuities in visual flows signal corresponding discontinuities in the physical world, thus it is critical to preserve them while processing the flow. In this paper we present a computational approach motivated by the architecture of primary visual cortex that directly incorporates boundary information into a flow <b>relaxation</b> <b>network.</b> The result is a robust computation of visual flows with the capacity to handle noisy or sparse data sets while providing stability along flow boundaries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by computing shading flows in images with intensity edges. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an approach}} for the fbsion of segmentation, classification and examination of task relevance into a grouping mechanism {{performed by a}} competitive neural <b>relaxation</b> <b>network.</b> This means, information extracted from the environment is selected according to {{the relevance of the}} systems intended action. Due to the fact of a task-specific focus of attention, we avoid the separation of perception and generation of behavior. Our network for the selection of action relevant visual regions consists of interacting columns with local excitatory and global inhibitory coupled feedback. The lateral cooperation is used as a way to integrate task pertinent subgoals. Possible subgoals are the size of regions, the security of a classification hypothesis and the valuation of the hypothesis for the task. The input activity, received from different hypothesis-layers, evokes several activation areas, which compete in a few iteration cycles. When equilibrium is attained cooperating neurons in one layer remain active, others are suppressed with regard to the relevant subgoals. The performance is demonstrated on a real-world selection of textured objects for a robot grasping task. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a capital budgeting problem {{in which each}} potential project requires {{the performance of a}} known set of activities. In general, these sets of activities are not mutually exclusive. However, when a particular activity is common to the requirements of multiple projects, a single performance of the activity simultaneously satisfies the requirements of the multiple projects. Associated with the performance of each activity are two quantities: a known fixed cost and a consumption of a known amount of a scarce resource. Because the sets of activities required by the projects are not mutually exclusive, we cannot apportion an activity's fixed cost or resource consumption to a single project. In this paper, we formulate this capital budgeting problem (and a slight variant) as a maximal network flow problem with a side constraint, and we report computational experience using Lagrangian relaxation to find an optimal solution. We also discuss an application to the selection of parts and tools to include in a field repair kit used to fix a variety of types of breakdowns. capital budgeting, Lagrangean <b>relaxation,</b> <b>network</b> flow...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that complex visual scenes contain multiple, {{overlapping}} objects, people perform object recognition with ease and accuracy. One operation that facilitates recognition is an early segmentation process in which features of objects are grouped and labeled according to which ob-ject they belong. Current computational systems that perform this oper-ation are based on predefined grouping heuristics. We describe a system called MAGIC that learn. how to group features based {{on a set of}} pre-segmented examples. In many cases, MAGIC discovers grouping heuristics similar to those previously proposed, but it also has the capability of find-ing nonintuitive structural regularities in images. Grouping is performed by a <b>relaxation</b> <b>network</b> that aUempts to dynamically bind related fea-tures. Features transmit a complex-valued signal (amplitude and phase) to one another; binding can thus be represented by phase locking related features. MAGIC'S training procedure is a generalization of recurrent back propagation to complex-valued units. When a visual image contains multiple, overlapping objects, recognition is difficult because features in the image are not grouped according to which object they belong. Without the capability to form such groupings, it would be necessary to undergo a massive search through all subsets of image features. For this reason, most machine vision recognition systems include a component that performs feature grouping o...|$|E
40|$|In project scheduling, {{a set of}} precedence-constrained jobs has to be {{scheduled}} so as to minimize a given objective. In resource-constrained project scheduling, the jobs additionally compete for scarce resources. Due to its universality, the latter problem {{has a variety of}} applications in manufacturing, production planning, project management, and elsewhere. It {{is one of the most}} intractable problems in operations research, and has therefore become a popular playground for the latest optimization techniques, including virtually all local search paradigms. We show that a somewhat more classical mathematical programming approach leads to both competitive feasible solutions and strong lower bounds, within quite reasonable computation times. The basic ingredients of our approach are the Lagrangian relaxation of a time-indexed integer programming formulation and relaxation-based list scheduling, enriched with a useful idea from recent approximation algorithms for machine scheduling problems. The efficiency of the algorithm results from the insight that the relaxed problem can be solved by computing a minimum cut in an appropriately defined directed graph.
