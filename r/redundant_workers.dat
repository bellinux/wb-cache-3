25|$|Although the 1970s in Italy {{was marked}} by violence, {{it was also a}} time of great social and {{economic}} progress. Following the civil disturbances of the 1960s, Christian Democracy and its allies in government (including the PSI) introduced a wide range of political, social, and economic reforms. Regional governments were introduced in the spring of 1970, with elected councils provided with the authority to legislate in areas like public works, town planning, social welfare, and health. Spending on the relatively poor South was significantly increased, while new laws relating to index-linked pay, public housing, and pension provision were also passed. In 1975, a law was passed entitling <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> to receive at least 80% of their previous salary for up to a year from a state insurance fund. Living standards also continued to rise, with wages going up by an average of about 25% a year from the early 1970s onwards, and between 1969 and 1978, average real wages rose by 72%. Various fringe benefits were raised {{to the extent that they}} amounted to an additional 50% to 60% on wages, the highest in any country in the Western world. In addition, working hours were reduced so that by the end of the decade they were lower than any other country apart from Belgium. Some categories of workers who were laid off received generous unemployment compensation which represented only a little less than full wages, often years beyond eligibility. Initially, these benefits were primarily enjoyed by industrial workers in northern Italy where the “Hot Autumn” had its greatest impact, but these benefits soon spread to other categories of workers in other areas. In 1975, the escalator clause was strengthened in wage contracts, providing a high proportion of workers with nearly 100% indexation, with quarterly revisions, thereby increasing wages nearly as fast as prices.|$|E

50|$|With {{unemployment}} around 16% {{and many}} {{jobs in the}} informal sector, Georgia undertook a far-reaching reform of labour regulation. The new Labour Code was adopted on 17 December 2010. The new law eases restrictions on the duration of term contracts {{and the number of}} overtime hours and discards the premium required for overtime work. It also eliminates the requirement to notify and get permission from the labour union to fire a <b>redundant</b> <b>worker.</b> The new law provides for 1 month’s severance pay at least, replacing complex rules under which required notice periods depended on seniority and the manager had to write long explanations to labor unions and the relevant ministry. In general, new regulation makes Georgian labor market much more flexible.|$|R

30|$|Obviously, as Ogino 79 has shown, {{workers in}} large mines and small mines came under such {{different}} management practices following the rationalization {{movement of the}} 1930 s that {{they could no longer}} be considered as belonging to the same social class. Shimazaki Naoko’s research on the Jôban case, on the other hand, has shown how the <b>redundant</b> <b>worker</b> re-employment policies developed in the 1970 s mainly for the larger mines were based, sometimes successfully, on the experience built during the first period of mine closures in the 1960 s, which mainly concerned the smaller mines. 80 However, what is certain is that for miners in general, whether from small or large mines, the industrial transition meant a drop in their standard of living at a time when Japanese society was experiencing the fastest economic growth in its history.|$|R
40|$|Generous early {{retirement}} provisions {{account for a}} large proportion of the drop in the labour force participation of elderly workers. The aim of this paper is to provide a political-economic explanation of the wide spread adoption of {{early retirement}}. We suggest that the political support for generous early retirement provisions relies on: (i) the existence of an initial, significant group of <b>redundant</b> elderly <b>workers</b> with incomplete working history, who are not entitled to an old age pension; and (ii) the policy persistence that this provision introduces by inducing low-ability workers to retire early. The majority which supports a social security system with early retirement in a bidimensional voting game is composed of elderly workers with incomplete working history and low-ability workers. A descriptive analysis of eleven OECD countries confirms the relevance of the initial group of <b>redundant</b> elderly <b>workers.</b> Early retirement provisions were adopted during the deindustrialization process, almost always, immediately after the first severe decrease in industrial employment.

5000|$|During {{the early}} Eighties, the Socialists {{introduced}} the [...] "congé de conversion" [...] ("conversion leave"), which received widespread publicity in 1984 when redundancy measures were introduced for the shipbuilding and steel industries. These combined the traditional tool of early retirement for <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> {{over the age}} of fifty with a [...] "conversion leave" [...] for others. These leaves suspended (but did not break) the work contract for a period of up to two years, and during this time the individual received 70% of their previous wage together with retraining in a new occupation. After the retraining was over, workers were promised two job offers. In 1985, the Fabius Government universalised the congé. The revamped congé de conversion offered <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> offered <b>redundant</b> <b>workers</b> 65% of their previous salary (in line with the benefits for early retirement and unemployment compensation) and a training period of 4-10 months. Between 1985 and 1987, however, only 15,000 workers had taken advantage of the congés, and only one-third succeeded in their [...] "conversion." [...] A year earlier, in 1984, the Fabius government established the travaux d'utilite collective (TUC) programme to prepare school leavers for professional life. This scheme offered unemployed youth between the ages of 16 and 21 sixteen (extended to 25 in 1985) the opportunity to work half time in a public sector job.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} why <b>redundant</b> skilled <b>workers</b> may {{be reluctant}} to accept interim unskilled jobs. If skilled work is more satisfying or less arduous for highly productive workers, then such workers invest more in moving quickly between skilled jobs. Thus, high productivity workers tend to search on the job, and if unemployed will specialize in job search, rather than take an interim position. If individual differences in productivity are known to the worker, but not the potential employer, then search strategy may be used as a productivity signal, with more than the efficient proportion of workers searching on the job and too few accepting interim unskilled jobs. Optimal policy requires a subsidy on interim unskilled jobs. Copyright 1990 by The Review of Economic Studies Limited. ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the job prospects of displaced industrial workers in Switzerland. Based on a survey of 1, 203 workers who were dismissed after their manufacturing plants closed down, we analyse the determinants of re-employment, the sector of re-employment and the change in wages. Two years after displacement, a majority of workers were back in employment: 69 % were re-employed, 17 % un-employed and 11 % retired. Amongst re-employed workers, two thirds found a job in manufacturing and one third in services. Contrary to a common belief, low-end services are not the collecting vessel of <b>redundant</b> industrial <b>workers.</b> Displaced workers aged 55 and older seem particularly vulnerable after a plant closes down: over 30 % were long-term unemployed, and those older workers who found a new job suffered disproportionate wage losses.
