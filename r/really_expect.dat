500|$|The {{restaurant}} {{was awarded a}} Michelin star for 2012. The list was announced in October 2011, only seven months after the restaurant opened. Borie said [...] "I am very surprised, but it is teamwork obviously, we didn't <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> anything {{because we have been}} in business for such a small amount of time." [...] Following the star, Borie increased the number of kitchen staff from three to six.|$|E
500|$|Jim Farber of the New York-based Daily News {{wrote in}} his review: [...] "It suffers from a {{similarly}} meandering melody and ponderous progression. The grandeur of its arrangement easily upstages the tune", but [...] "even so, the luster of Adele's tone, and the bravura arc of her vocal, makes it enjoyable enough. And, fifty years down the line, isn't that all we <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> from a Bond product these days?" [...] Yahoo!'s Rob O'Connor gave the standalone song a positive review, but {{felt that it was}} too soon to tell how the song would fit into the wider canon of Bond theme songs. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph was less complimentary, describing the song as [...] "classy", but at the same time, [...] "overly predictable".|$|E
500|$|In 1996 Dibnah {{repaired}} the [...] chimney at Barrow Bridge—the same chimney he had scaled for a bet, in his youth. [...] He {{was also}} asked to install a peregrine falcon nest at the top. [...] He was later influential in ensuring the chimney was made a listed building. [...] As a notable raconteur he also became an after-dinner speaker and would wear his trademark flat cap with his dinner jacket. [...] He made an appearance in a 1996 television advertisement for Kelloggs, but the strain of living with a man so dedicated to his hobbies began to take its toll on his wife: [...] "Sometimes he'll have busted his thumb because he's hit it with a hammer; you couldn't <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> him then {{to come in and}} start doing things in the house. [...] I just don't think it's fair though, I think you've got to strike a balance and I think ours is about 90/10. [...] Me for 90 per cent of the housework and Fred for 10." [...] Susan met another man and moved out, taking Roger with her and leaving Jack with Fred.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. CURWEN, {{drawing her}} shawl about her shoulders, {{as if to}} be ready to step out: [...] "Well, I never get into one without taking my life in my hand, and my heart in my mouth.

500|$|Garfield {{began taking}} acting classes in Guildford, Surrey, {{when he was}} 9, and {{appeared}} in a youth theatre production of Bugsy Malone. He also joined a small youth theatre workshop group in Epsom and took Theatre Studies at A-level before studying for a further 3 years at a UK conservatoire, the Central School of Speech and Drama. Upon graduating in 2004 he began working primarily in stage acting. In 2004 he won a Manchester Evening News Theatre Award for Best Newcomer for his performance in Kes at Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre (where he also played Romeo the year after), and won the Outstanding Newcomer Award at the 2006 Evening Standard Theatre Awards. Garfield made his British television debut in 2005 appearing in the Channel 4 teen drama Sugar Rush. In 2007 he garnered public attention when he appeared in the series 3 of the BBC's Doctor Who, in the episodes [...] "Daleks in Manhattan" [...] and [...] "Evolution of the Daleks". Garfield commented that it was [...] "an honour" [...] {{to be a part}} of Doctor Who. In October 2007, he was named one of Varietys [...] "10 Actors to Watch". He made his American film debut in November 2007, playing an American university student in the ensemble drama Lions for Lambs, with co-stars Tom Cruise, Meryl Streep and Robert Redford. [...] "I'm just lucky to be there working on the same project as them, although I don't <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> to be recognised later by audiences," [...] Garfield told Variety in 2007. In his review for The Boston Globe, Wesley Morris considered Garfield's work [...] "a willing punching bag for the movie's jabs and low blows".|$|E
2500|$|This measure, which {{examines}} Medicare {{spending in}} the context of the US economy as a whole, is expected to increase from 3.6 percent in 2010 to 6.2 percent by 2090 under current law and over 9 percent under what the actuaries <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> will happen (called an [...] "illustrative example" [...] in recent-year Trustees Reports).|$|E
2500|$|The {{turning point}} for Collins in his {{decision}} to become an astronaut was the Mercury Atlas 6 flight of John Glenn on February 20, 1962, {{and the thought of}} being able to circle the Earth in 90 minutes. He immediately applied for the second group of astronauts that year. To raise their numbers, the Air Force sent their best applicants to a [...] "charm school". Medical and psychiatric examinations at Brooks Air Force Base, Texas and interviews at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston followed. In mid-September he found that he had not been accepted, something that was a blow even though he did not <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> to be accepted. Collins still rates the second group of nine as the best group of astronauts ever selected by NASA.|$|E

50|$|No one had <b>really</b> <b>expected</b> {{the latest}} upgrade {{to lead to}} a {{dramatic}} improvement in sales. 1929 was the last full year for the W05 car which was replaced by the W10 “Typ Mannheim” model, which would be built on a slightly shorter wheelbase.|$|R

6000|$|... "No; you're the one {{constant}} and steadfast creature {{in a world}} of variableness. I didn't <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> that. I know that I can always find you where I left you. You are the same as when I first saw you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} the code bound in green morocco leather," [...] he announced, [...] "on the {{left-hand}} side, underneath the duplicate of a proposed Treaty between Italy and--some other Power.

60|$|But Hewet's {{complacency}} was {{a little}} chilled as he walked with Hirst {{to the place where}} a general meeting had been appointed. He wondered why on earth he had asked these people, and what one <b>really</b> <b>expected</b> to get from bunching human beings up together.|$|R
50|$|He was {{unexpectedly}} {{elected to}} Parliament in the 1997 General Election, {{as part of}} the Labour landslide election victory while he was not <b>really</b> <b>expecting</b> to win a normally Conservative seat which he retained in the 2001 General Election, {{and is a member of}} the Fabian Society.|$|R
60|$|Glenn {{laughed in}} a way which proved to Carley that he knew {{perfectly}} well how she felt. Again his smile caused her self-reproach. Plain indeed was it that he had <b>really</b> <b>expected</b> more of her in the way of complaint and less of fortitude. Carley bit her lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you wonder, do you?" [...] mockingly replied a camel-cracker hanging near, [...] "do you <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> any one {{to gather}} you, with your thick hide and clumsy legs? Why, the {{children}} would break their teeth on you at the first bite." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{need to do}} that, I'll 'phone. I didn't <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> you," [...] she explained. [...] "Get off {{and come}} in a few minutes, and I'll see what I can hustle {{together}} for an outfit. I haven't rode a lick since I left Sibley." ...|$|E

50|$|It {{remained}} {{at this level}} until 2008, when it achieved promotion to the top level, facing Europe's number 7 to 11 teams in 2009 and 2010. Its declared aim at this level was to avoid relegation; qualification for the 2011 Rugby World Cup was not <b>really</b> <b>expected</b> from the team.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you kindly {{read that}} passage over again?" [...] Milray asked as Clementina {{paused at the}} end of a certain paragraph. She read it, while he listened attentively.

6000|$|Father {{was even}} more excited. He {{spent most of his}} time on the {{platform}} or hanging from the window.

6000|$|She did {{not attempt}} to deny it. [...] "I oughtn't to have done it, and I ought to have told you at once--the next letter--but I--you said you were coming, and I thought if you did come--I didn't <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> you to; and it was all a joke,--off-hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|That was true, {{and the man}} knew it. He did not <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> or want to meet a bear, {{but thought}} the idea of one would send the little fellows home at once. Finding {{one of them was}} unscared, he laughed, and said with a nod to Tommy,-- ...|$|E
60|$|It is all China, now, and my sympathies {{are with}} the Chinese. They have been villainously dealt with by the sceptred thieves of Europe, and I hope they will drive all the foreigners out and keep them out for good. I only wish it; of course I don't <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he reflected, [...] "that {{was because}} you were a stranger. It's odd--they're all like that. I suppose it's because nobody <b>really</b> <b>expects</b> or {{believes}} in the unlooked-for thing, and yet that's the thing that always happens. And then, of course, that other affair, which really is serious, startled you the more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{not one to}} {{fear the}} truth," [...] she answered, quickly. [...] "I come {{of a family of}} questioners. It's only now and then that I waver--for a moment.

2500|$|... "I'd never <b>really</b> <b>expected</b> to play Test cricket – three {{family members}} had already played, {{what were the}} chances of a fourth?" [...] said Trevor Chappell.

6000|$|... "I <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> to find life {{a little}} {{difficult}} at first," [...] admitted Dominey, with a shrug of his shoulders.

6000|$|... "See here, Julia, {{how long}} do you <b>really</b> <b>expect</b> me to endure this kind of thing?" [...] Julia made him no answer; she only leaned back in her chair with her eyes upon his. He met her gaze a moment; then he turned round to the fire and for another moment looked into it. After this he faced his hostess again with the exclamation: [...] "It's so foolish--it's so damnably foolish!" ...|$|E
50|$|Of course, this fortuitous turn isn't {{without a}} catch. His uncle, a rather mysterious man, {{installed}} Ranmaru at Asao {{to serve as}} his spy.
