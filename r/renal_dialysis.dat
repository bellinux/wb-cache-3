40|$|BackgroundThis {{observational}} {{study sought to}} determine whether the degree of hemodilution during cardiopulmonary bypass is independently related to perioperative acute <b>renal</b> failure necessitating <b>dialysis</b> support. MethodsData were prospectively collected on consecutive patients undergoing cardiac operations with cardiopulmonary bypass from 1999 to 2003 at a tertiary care hospital. The independent relationship was assessed between the degree of hemodilution during cardiopulmonary bypass, as measured by nadir hematocrit concentration, and acute <b>renal</b> failure necessitating <b>dialysis</b> support. Multivariate logistic regression was used to control for variables known to be associated with perioperative renal failure and anemia. ResultsOf the 9080 patients included in the analysis, 1. 5 % (n = 134) had acute <b>renal</b> failure necessitating <b>dialysis</b> support. There was an independent, nonlinear relationship between nadir hematocrit concentration during cardiopulmonary bypass and acute <b>renal</b> failure necessitating <b>dialysis</b> support. Moderate hemodilution (nadir hematocrit concentration, 21 %- 25 %) was associated with the lowest risk of acute <b>renal</b> failure necessitating <b>dialysis</b> support; the risk increased as nadir hematocrit concentration deviated from this range in either direction (P =. 005). Compared with moderate hemodilution, the adjusted odds ratio for acute <b>renal</b> failure necessitating <b>dialysis</b> support with severe hemodilution (nadir hematocrit concentration 25 %) it was 1. 88 (95 % confidence interval, 1. 02 - 3. 46). ConclusionsGiven that there is an independent association between the degree of hemodilution during cardiopulmonary bypass and perioperative acute <b>renal</b> failure necessitating <b>dialysis</b> support, patient outcomes may be improved if the nadir hematocrit concentration during cardiopulmonary bypass is kept within the identified optimal range. Randomized clinical trials, however, are needed to determine whether this is a cause-effect relationship or simply an association...|$|R

25|$|In early 2006, Benefis {{sought to}} stop the Great Falls Clinic from {{purchasing}} 20-bed Central Montana Surgical Hospital. The clinic had partnered with Essentia Health, a non-profit healthcare system based in Minnesota and North Dakota, to purchase Harold Poulsen's outstanding stock in Central Montana Surgical Hospital and gain a controlling interest in the surgical hospital. Benefis sued to prevent the transaction, arguing that the new owners intended to run the facility as a specialty hospital in contravention of a 2005 state law banning further construction {{of these types of}} facilities and that the Clinic and Essentia did not apply for the required health care facility license. The health system won a temporary restraining order. Benefis also said it stood to lose $4 million a year in revenues if Central Montana Surgical Hospital was licensed as a general hospital. The company said it would likely close its <b>renal</b> <b>dialysis</b> unit, suspend Mercy Flights, shutter its nursing home, and end outpatient psychiatric and chemical dependency services. Benefis also said it would lose several million dollars a year in federal payments as well. On March 24, the injunction was lifted. Benefis filed an emergency motion with the Montana Supreme Court three days later, appealing the district court's ruling. The state of Montana then issued a six-month provisional license to Central Montana to operate as a general hospital. But on October 4, 2006, the Montana Supreme Court ruled 4-to-3 to uphold the district court's dismissal of the temporary injunction. However, the state supreme court declined to rule on other issues raised by Benefis' lawsuit, and left open the door for the company to continue litigation in the district courts. On November 6, 2006, Benefis declined to appeal the high court's ruling and said it would not bring the other issues back to the district court. In February 2007, the Clinic sued Benefis to recover its legal fees. A state judge ruled in September 2007 that Benefis must pay these fees.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{aprotinin}} in {{cardiac surgery}} to reduce perioperative bleeding and transfusion is controversial. We assessed {{the effect of}} aprotinin on the risk of acute renal failure in 423 patients who underwent on-pump cardiac surgery between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006. Of these 423 patients, 318 (75. 2 %) received aprotinin (median dose= 3. 0 million KIU, standard deviation= 2. 8 million KIU; interquartile range: 2 million KIU to 4 million KIU). Aprotinin {{was more likely to}} be used in patients who did not cease aspirin before surgery, in urgent or emergency surgery, who had impaired left ventricular function, a longer period of bypass and aortic cross-clamp time, and with both coronary artery bypass graft and valvular surgery performed. The overall incidence of acute <b>renal</b> failure requiring <b>dialysis</b> was 2. 8 %. The use of aprotinin was not associated with a reduction in transfusion nor an increased risk of <b>renal</b> failure requiring <b>dialysis,</b> atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular accident or mortality in the univarate analyses.

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{recovery}} of <b>renal</b> functions in <b>dialysis</b> dependent patients {{is estimated to}} be greater than 1 %, there are no indicators that actually suggest such revival of renal function. Residual <b>renal</b> function in <b>dialysis</b> patients is unreliable and seldom followed. Therefore renal recovery (RR) in dialysis dependent patients may remain unnoticed. We present a group of dialysis dependent patients who regained their renal functions. The aim of this project is to determine any indicators that may identify the {{recovery of}} <b>renal</b> functions in <b>dialysis</b> dependent patients. Methods All the discharges from the chronic dialysis facilities were identified. Among these discharges deaths, transplants, voluntary withdrawals and transfers either to another modality or another dialysis facility were excluded in order to isolate the patients with RR. The dialysis flow sheets and medical records of these patients were subsequently reviewed. Results Eight patients {{with a mean age of}} 53. 8 ± 6. 7 years (± SEM) were found to have RR. Dialysis was initiated due to uremic symptoms in 6 patients and fluid overload in the remaining two. The patients remained dialysis dependent for 11. 1 ± 4. 2 months. All these patients had good urine output and 7 had symptoms related to dialysis. Their mean pre-initiation creatinine and BUN levels were 5. 21 ± 0. 6 mg/dl and 72. 12 ± 11. 12 mg/dl, respectively. Upon discontinuation, they remained dialysis free for 19. 75 ± 5. 97 months. The mean creatinine and BUN levels after cessation of dialysis were 2. 85 ± 0. 57 mg/dl and 29. 62 ± 5. 26 mg/dl, respectively, while the mean creatinine clearance calculated by 24 -hour urine collection was 29. 75 ± 4. 78 ml/min. One patient died due to HIV complications. One patient resumed dialysis after nine months. Remaining continue to enjoy a dialysis free life. Conclusion RR must be considered in patients with good urine output and unresolved acute <b>renal</b> failure. <b>Dialysis</b> intolerance may be an indicator of RR among such patients. </p...|$|R
