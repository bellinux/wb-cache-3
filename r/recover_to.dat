5|$|Unfortunately, episode 1 of The Mind of Evil {{contains}} no colour information. In principle, BBC engineers {{were supposed to}} filter out the chroma dots upon telerecording, to create a cleaner and nicer picture. In most cases they {{failed to do so}} properly, allowing the colour recovery process to work. For this one episode, the filter had been correctly applied – so there was no colour to <b>recover.</b> <b>To</b> complete the serial for DVD, the episode was manually colourised by Stuart Humphryes and Peter Crocker – thereby returning the final Pertwee episode to its original colour presentation.|$|E
5|$|Bradman rotated the two glovemen {{during the}} tour, and Tallon played in 14 of the 31 {{first-class}} matches, taking 29 catches and 14 stumpings. Tallon's catch of Len Hutton in the Fifth Test at The Oval {{was described as}} Wisden as {{the best of the}} year. He also took a difficult catch to remove George Emmett in the Third Test at Old Trafford, catching a ball that flew to his feet at yorker length. However, Tallon also had some mishaps, with finger injuries inflicted by failing to catch the ball correctly. Tallon had few opportunities with the bat, scoring 283 runs at a batting average of 25.72 in 13 first-class innings, including two fifties. During the Test, Tallon scored 112 runs at 28.00, including a 53 in the Second Test that saw Australia <b>recover</b> <b>to</b> a first innings of 350 after a middle-order slump had seen England take the upper hand. He took 12 catches in the Tests.|$|E
5|$|Captain Scarlet becomes Spectrum's {{foremost}} {{weapon in}} its {{fight against the}} Mysterons after {{the events of the}} pilot episode, in which the Mysterons threaten to assassinate the World President as their first act of retaliation. The original Captain Scarlet is {{killed in a car accident}} engineered by the Mysterons and replaced with a re-created Mysteron likeness. However, when the Captain Scarlet duplicate is shot by Spectrum officer Captain Blue and falls to his death from a tall structure, he returns to life with the consciousness and the normal personality of the original Captain Scarlet fully restored let alone his memories of Mysteron control, and thereafter he is free from Mysteron control. Captain Scarlet's Mysteronised body possesses two remarkable abilities: he is able to sense the presence of other Mysteron duplicates in his vicinity, and if he is injured or killed, his retro-metabolism restores him to a state of top health. Now able to deploy suicidally reckless tactics to thwart Mysteron threats, Captain Scarlet repeatedly braves the pain of death in the knowledge that he will <b>recover</b> <b>to</b> face the Mysterons again.|$|E

5|$|England and New Zealand met {{each other}} in the first match of the Super Sixes. England batted first, and despite being 96 for four at one stage, 57 runs from captain Charlotte Edwards, and a rapid 22 runs from Gunn, helped their side <b>recover</b> <b>to</b> post a total of 201 for five. In response, New Zealand began positively, and were boosted by a half-century from their captain, Tiffen, but the spin bowling of Edwards, Marsh and Colvin {{controlled}} the run rate, and New Zealand were eventually bowled out for 170, Edwards taking four wickets. England's following match was against the West Indies, and they once again surpassed 200 runs after batting first. Sarah Taylor, Claire Taylor and Atkins all scored half-centuries to propel England to their total of 236 for eight. The English bowlers then dismissed the West Indies for 90 runs, with Marsh collecting three wickets. The win secured England a place in the final, irrespective of the result in their final match against Australia.|$|E
5|$|Following a 0–0 draw with Manchester United in the 1977 FA Charity Shield, {{a disappointing}} {{start to the}} 1977–78 season saw Liverpool out of the title race early on whilst they exited the FA Cup at the Third Round. They did though <b>recover</b> <b>to</b> post a second-place finish in the league after winning nine of their last 12 matches, to end the {{campaign}} seven points behind Nottingham Forest. They progressed to the League Cup Final after Kennedy scored the winning goal past former club Arsenal in the semi-final. However Liverpool lost out 1–0 to Nottingham Forest in the replay of the final at Old Trafford. Despite these domestic disappointments, Liverpool went on to reach {{the final of the}} European Cup after defeating Dynamo Dresden, Benfica (Portugal), and Borussia Mönchengladbach; Mönchengladbach manager Udo Lattek singled out Kennedy as the best player of the semi-final, as Kennedy scored a goal and provided assists for both Kenny Dalglish and Jimmy Case in the second leg. In the final Liverpool faced Club Brugge at Wembley, and successfully defended the trophy after seeing out a 1–0 win.|$|E
5|$|On {{the eve of}} the Fifth Test at The Oval, Miller {{announced}} that the tour would be his last, so that he would retire from cricket after the tour of the Indian subcontinent on the return voyage. In his final Test on English soil, he took 4/91 in the first innings. Miller came in to bat at 5/47 and helped Australia <b>recover</b> <b>to</b> 202, top-scoring with 61. He took another one wicket in the second innings and was unbeaten on seven when stumps were drawn in the second innings. The series ended 1–2. He ended the series with 199runs at 28.43 and topped the bowling with 21wickets at 22.23. He topped the first-class bowling for the Australians with 50wickets at 19.60.|$|E

5|$|Pathan {{subsequently}} led {{the pace}} attack {{again on the}} 2004 Test tour to Pakistan, taking 12 wickets and bowling {{a higher proportion of}} maiden overs than any other bowler to help secure India's first series victory over Pakistan in two decades. In the first innings, he bowled 28 overs and took 4/100 to help India restrict their arch-rivals to 407 and take a 268-run lead. After stand-in captain Rahul Dravid enforced the follow on, Pathan tied the Pakistanis down, bowling 12 maidens in his 21 overs to end with 2/26 as India secured an innings win. Pathan then scored 49 in the Second Test in Lahore after a batting collapse of the top order, helping India to <b>recover</b> <b>to</b> 287. However this was not enough as Pakistan reached 489 despite Pathan bowling 44 overs to take 3/107, and the hosts went on to complete a nine-wicket win. In the deciding Test in Rawalpindi, Pathan took 2/49 and 1/35 in an innings win. He ended the series with 12 wickets at 28.50 and 64 runs at 21.33.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} against Surrey {{and started the}} day after the Second Test. McCool bowled only three overs in the first innings, before {{contributing}} 26 with the bat in Australia's reply. After the tourists had taken a first innings lead of 168, McCool bowled heavily as Bradman eased the workload on his Test players in the second innings. McCool removed Surrey's top three batsmentwo of them stumped by Saggersto leave the hosts at 3/94. A 107-run seventh wicket stand saw Surrey <b>recover</b> <b>to</b> 6/267 before McCool took three of the last four wickets to end the innings at 289. McCool ended with 6/113 from 45.5 overs, having bowled approximately 40% of the overs. Australia chased down the 122 runs required for victory in less than hour to complete a 10-wicket win.|$|E

5|$|Davidson was {{in strong}} all round {{form in the}} 1961–62 Australian season, which was a purely {{domestic}} one. Against Victoria in Sydney, he scored 106 in a hard hitting innings with the tail. He made 58 of the 59runs added in a last wicket partnership with Doug Ford, the other being a leg bye. The partnership lasted only 44 balls and Davidson managed to farm the strike and face 41 of these. The effort helped {{to set up a}} ten-wicket win. The following week against Western Australia in Perth, he made 108 after New South Wales had slumped to 6/38 to help the visitors <b>recover</b> <b>to</b> 218. New South Wales struggled in their second innings and Western Australia needed only 175 for victory. However, Davidson took his career best innings bowling figures of 7/31 to bowl out the hosts for 106 and seize a victory. In both matches against Queensland, Davidson took four quick wickets in the second innings to secure narrow victories after bold declarations. New South Wales won the Shield in that season with 64 of a maximum possible 80 points, playing aggressive cricket under Benaud. It was their ninth title in a row. Davidson was a key factor in the dominance, scoring 521runs at 40.07 and taking 42 wickets at 13.62.|$|E
5|$|In 1519 and 1520, {{before the}} arrival of the Spanish in the region, a number of {{epidemics}} swept through southern Guatemala. At {{the same time as the}} Spanish were occupied with the overthrow of the Aztec empire, a devastating plague struck the Kaqchikel capital of Iximche, and the city of Q'umarkaj, capital of the K'iche', may also have suffered from the same epidemic. It is likely that the same combination of smallpox and a pulmonary plague swept across the entire Guatemalan Highlands. Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33–50% of the population of the highlands perished. Population levels in the Guatemalan Highlands did not <b>recover</b> <b>to</b> their pre-conquest levels until the middle of the 20th century. In 1666 pestilence or murine typhus swept through what is now the department of Huehuetenango. Smallpox was reported in San Pedro Saloma, in 1795. At the time of the fall of Nojpetén in 1697, there are estimated to have been 60,000 Maya living around Lake Petén Itzá, including a large number of refugees from other areas. It is estimated that 88% of them died during the first ten years of colonial rule owing to a combination of disease and war.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{the most}} {{economical}} Australian in the first innings of the game against Warwickshire. He took 3/29 from 22.3 overs as the hosts fell for 138, before making an unbeaten 13 at No. 9 as Australia struggled to 254 in reply. He was given a solitary maiden over in the second innings before Australia won by nine wickets. Australia then faced and drew with Lancashire {{for the second time}} on the tour. Johnson came to the crease at 6/202 after Bradman’s men had suffered a middle-order collapse of 3/8. He made 48 as the Australian lower order wagged to push the score to 321. Johnson was given a light bowling load in the first innings, sending down only five overs, but he removed three of the last four wickets to end with 3/5 as the hosts fell for 130. He did not bat in the second innings and took 1/30 as the home side managed to hang on with seven wickets down. In the non-first-class match against Durham, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings, Johnson came in at 7/212 and made 44 to help Australia <b>recover</b> <b>to</b> 282 and took 1/2 from three overs as the hosts reached 5/73 when rain ended the match after the first day.|$|E

5|$|The Test started amid {{controversy}} {{following the}} omission of leading England batsman Len Hutton for performing poorly in the previous match. Having largely failedapart from brief periodsto challenge Australia {{in the first two}} Tests, the hosts had made four changes to their team in an attempt to find a combination that could threaten the visitors' supremacy. Australia made their first change for the series, ending the Test career of veteran batsman Bill Brown after two poor matches. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat, but his team were quickly in trouble, with Denis Compton forced from the field after being bloodied in the head by a Ray Lindwall bouncer. At this stage, the hosts were at 33/2 with an injured player, and they batted defensively for a period to try and regroup. Having received treatment, Compton returned with England in difficulty at 119/5 midway through the day and proceeded to score 145 not out, aided by several dropped catches, helping England to <b>recover</b> <b>to</b> 363 all out on the second afternoon. England could have been in an even stronger position, but Compton and seamer Alec Bedser were involved in a mix-up, resulting in the latter being run out and ending a 121-run partnership. Lindwall was the most successful bowler, taking 4/99. During the England innings, Australian opener Sid Barnes, who had gained much attention throughout the season for fielding at point-blank range in front of the batsman on strike, was hit in the ribs by a Dick Pollard pull shot and had to be carried from the ground and hospitalised. In reply, Australia batted steadily to be 126/3 {{by the end of the}} second day, but then fell to be 172/6—effectively seven wickets down with Barnes unable to bat after collapsing again—before evading the follow on by reaching 221. Australia scored slowly through the innings, finding the hosts' bowlers difficult to negotiate; Bedser took 4/81 and Pollard 3/53.|$|E
