40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} the punitive <b>damages</b> <b>class</b> action is {{susceptible}} not only to doctrinal restraints imposed on class actions but also to constitutional due process limitations placed on punitive damages. Thus, {{it would seem that}} the prospects for punitive <b>damages</b> <b>classes</b> are even grimmer than for class actions generally. This conventional picture misunderstands the role of punitive damages and, in particular, the relationship between class actions and punitive damages. It either ignores or underestimates the distinctly societal element of punitive damages, which makes them especially conducive to aggregate treatment. Furthermore, punitive <b>damages</b> <b>classes</b> offer a solution to the constitutional due process problem of juries awarding “classwide” damages in a single-plaintiff case. Courts’ conceptualization of punitive damages as either individualistic or societal dictates how they decide the certification question. My survey of recent case law reveals that courts taking the plaintiff-focused individualistic view of punitive damages tend to deny class certification, while courts embracing the defendant-focused societal view are more likely to certify a punitive <b>damages</b> <b>class,</b> all else being equal. Therefore, the viability of the punitive <b>damages</b> <b>class</b> depends upon the persuasiveness of the societal conception of punitive damages. Based on this empirical grounding, I discuss two possibilities for reform. First, state legislatures and courts could affirmatively define the collectivized, societal rationale for punitive damages. Such state legislative measures would likely withstand constitutional scrutiny under Philip Morris USA v. Williams, given the U. S. Supreme Court’s reaffirmation of the primacy of the state’s role in defining the legitimate purposes of punitive damages. Second, federal courts — in the absence of definitive guidance from authoritative sources on state substantive law — could consider the underlying societal rationale for punitive damages in the course of their certification decisions. To do so would not only be permitted, but indeed warranted, by the Rules Enabling Act...|$|R

30|$|Landform {{and damage}} {{classification}} surveys {{have been conducted}} on six colonies worst-hit by the 2004 mid-Niigata prefecture earthquake.

40|$|The BP {{oil spill}} {{litigation}} and subsequent settlements {{provide an opportunity}} to explore a novel societal economic deterrence rationale for classwide supra-compensatory damages. Judge Jack Weinstein was a pioneer in the field of punitive <b>damages</b> <b>class</b> certification. In In re Simon II, he certified a nationwide punitive-damages-only class in a multijurisdiction, multidefendant tobacco lawsuit. Using Judge Weinstein’s innovations in In re Simon II as an analytical lens, the Article evaluates the future prospects for classwide punitive damages claims. Specifically, the Article considers how private litigants might adopt a societal damages approach in negotiating and achieving class action settlements. Class action settlements readily accommodate the “public law” dimension of societal damages, as demonstrated by the classwide punitive damages settlement with BP’s co-defendant Halliburton. Indeed, on closer inspection, even the BP compensatory <b>damages</b> <b>class</b> settlement has a surrounding aura of societal damages. For even that ostensibly purely compensatory arrangement included an unusual (and mostly overlooked) feature: a provision for supra-compensatory multipliers applicable to certain claimants. This Article advances the new idea that these supra-compensatory multipliers are a form of classwide societal damages embedded within the settlement, and, in turn, a potential blueprint for nascent punitive <b>damages</b> <b>classes</b> of the future...|$|R

40|$|The {{union of}} punitive <b>damages</b> and <b>class</b> actions can be aptly {{described}} with Samuel Johnson’s famous quotation regarding marriage: “The triumph of hope over experience. ” By most conventional wisdom, {{there is little}} future for plaintiffs or defendants who desire to resolve punitive damages claims globally using the procedural vehicle of a class action. From a conceptual perspective, however, there are circumstances under which the union could function. This Article explores those possibilities, not {{in the spirit of}} normative support, but in the spirit of exploring theories that may have some prospective vitality. Notwithstanding the chilly reception that punitive <b>damages</b> <b>class</b> actions have received from appellate courts, there are several approaches at the micro and macro levels of analysis suggesting that “hope” is still persistent. By disaggregating the United States Supreme Court punitive damages jurisprudence, it is possible to identify a limited number of factual scenarios where a class action for punitive damages could be successful. These micro-level observations can constitute a road map for navigating the current seemingly insurmountable barriers that have severely limited the use of class actions in punitive damages claims. At the macro level, there are two observations {{that could lead to a}} revision of punitive <b>damages</b> <b>class</b> actions: the seemingly undaunted, pragmatic desire on the part of trial judges to resolve similar cases collectively, and the powerful support for an economic vision of punitive damages that leads inevitably to a global, rather than individual, procedural approach...|$|R

40|$|In this Article, I {{consider}} whether 2 ̆ 2 limited generosity 2 ̆ 2 classes {{may be used}} to determine a defendant 2 ̆ 7 s entire liability for punitive damages arising from a defined course of conduct. The goals of such a class action would include adequately punishing and deterring the defendant, keeping the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s liability within state-mandated and constitutional limits, and facilitating equitable distribution of the damages among injured plaintiffs. The Article describes the legal limits on punitive damages liability that states have established and that the Supreme Court has held substantive due process to impose, and then carefully examines whether such limits constitute a predicate for mandatory class certification under Rule 23 (b) (1) (BJ of the Federal Rules and analogous state rules. I consider, in particular, the implications of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 1999 decision in Ortiz v. Fibreboard Corp. for such punitive <b>damages</b> <b>classes.</b> In the final section of the Article, I consider the obstacles to issuance of anti-suit injunctions that could prevent mandatory punitive <b>damages</b> <b>classes</b> from being undermined by parallel pursuit of such damages in separate actions brought by class members...|$|R
