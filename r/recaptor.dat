5000|$|Relations were deteriorating with France and Congress began {{enacting}} laws providing armed American ships greater {{ability to}} reclaim American ships {{taken by the}} French. In 1798, Congress passed legislation allowing for payment of 1/8 full value of the vessel, {{to be paid to}} the <b>recaptor,</b> for ships reclaimed from the French. However, in 1799, Congress enacted another law allowing the recaptors of a private vessel 1/2 salvage value of the ship, where retaken after 96 hours from the enemy. This was to be paid by the vessel's owner and without any deduction.|$|E
40|$|Our {{previous}} work {{has demonstrated that}} arginine vasopressin (AVP) {{plays a role in}} pain modulation. The present study investigated which kinds of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters in central nervous system might be involved in AVP antinociceptive role in the rat. The results showed that (1) intraventricular injection (icv) of V 1 receptor antagonist [d(CH 2) 5 Tyr(Me) AVP] and V 2 receptor antagonist [d(CH 2) 5 [D-Ile 2, Ile 4, Ala 9 -NH 2]AVP] blocked the antinociceptive effect induced by AVP (icv), (2) the opiate <b>recaptor</b> antagonist (naloxone) reversed the antinociceptive effect induced by AVP (icv), and (3) both the serotonin receptor antagonist (cypoheptadine) and M receptor antagonist (atropine) could attenuate the antinociceptive effect induced by AVP (icv); but (4) oxytocin, dopamine, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), N, α or β receptor antagonist did not influence the antinociceptive effect induced by AVP (icv). The data suggested that AVP antinociceptive role was involved in the endogenous opiate peptide, serotonin and acetylcholine systems in central nervous system...|$|E
40|$|Intrarenal {{renin-angiotensin system}} (RAS) {{activation}} plays {{a critical role}} in the development and progression of renal injury. In the kidney, all of the RAS components are present and intrarenal angiotensin II (Ang II) is formed by multiple independent mechanisms. Angiotensinogen (AGT) is the only known substrate for renin that is a rate-limiting enzyme of the RAS. Recently, enhanced intrarenal AGT levels have been shown to reflect the intrarenal RAS status in hypertension, chronic glomerular disease and diabetic nephropathy. In this review, we focus on AGT expression of the diseased glomeruli in the progression of glomerular disease. An anti-glomerular basement membrane nephritis rat model developed progressive proteinuria and glomerular crescent formation, accompanied by increased macrophage infiltration and glomerular expression of AGT and Ang II. The addition of Ang II type 1 receptor blocker to CC-chemokine <b>recaptor</b> 2 antagonist markedly attenuated the induction of macrophage infiltration, AGT and Ang II, and reduced glomerular crescent formation. Next, the levels of glomerular AGT expression and marker of reactive oxygen species in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) obese rats were higher than those in ZDF lean rats. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) induced an increase in the AGT expression in primary rat mesangial cells. Furthermore, the H 2 O 2 -induced upregulation of AGT was inhibited by a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and a c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor. These data suggest the potential contribution of enhanced AGT expression in glomeruli to the intrarenal RAS activation for the development of glomerular disease...|$|E

40|$|Integrin receptors have {{remained}} {{as a key}} subject {{of interest in the}} pharmaceutical industry for the last few years. There are a total of 24 different types of integrin heterodimers. Each of these heterodimers plays important role in various biological processes that are inherent to different pathological conditions. As a result, integrin receptors have been extensively evaluated for their role in therapeutic targeting. There are different classes of inhibitors against integrin receptors and this review provides an overview on different classes of integrin inhibitors that are currently available. A number of review articles have been written on the possible application of integrin receptors in therapeutic targeting. Many of these articles have heavily emphasized on the importance of αvβ 3 & αvβ 5 receptors as major pharmaceutical target in cancer but little emphasis has been given on the importance of other integrin receptors, such as α 5 β 1, αIIbβ 3, α 4 β 7, αvβ 6 etc. While this review gives due importance to both αvβ 3 & αvβ 5 receptorsand provides an historical perspective on how these two receptors have evolved as a potential target for cancer, significant emphasis has also been given on the other integrin receptors that have started enjoying the status of important drug target over the course of last few years. Effort has been maintained to discuss briefly on the key physiological basis of their importance as drug target. For example, involvement of αvβ 3 inangiogenesis has made it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer. At the same time expression of this receptor on the surface of osteoclast has made it a target for the treatment of osteoporosis. Thus, emphasis has been given on discussing the role of the integrin receptors in different disease conditions followed by specific examples of drug molecules that have been trialed against these receptors. While hundreds of candidate molecules have been developed against different integrin receptors only a handful of them has been subject to phase-III clinical trial. That necessitates careful consideration of certain concerns that are associated with direct targeting of integrins and thus has also been an important goal of this review. In the last few years application of integrin receptors have extended beyond mere therapeutic targeting. Several integrin receptors arecurrently are studied for their potential of aiding at diagnostic imaging and drug delivery. In this review a brief overview has also been provided on how integrin <b>recaptors</b> are being targeted for diagnostic imaging and drug delivery with relevant examples. Thus the primary aim of this review has been to provide an comprehensive overview on the broad scope of application that integrin receptors have in the field of medical science. </p...|$|R
40|$|Nicotinic acid adenine {{dinucleotide}} phosphate (NAADP +) is {{a recently}} identified metabolite of NADP + {{that is as}} potent as inositol trisphosphate (IP 3) and cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) in mobilizing intracellular Ca 2 + in sea urchin eggs and microsomes (Clapper, D. L., Walseth, T. F., Dargie, P. J., and Lee, H. C. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9561 - 9568; Lee, H. C., and Aarhus, R. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 2152 - 2157). The mechanism of Ca 2 + release activated by NAADP + and the Ca 2 + stores it acts on {{are different from those}} of IP 3 and cADPR. In this study we show that photolyzing caged NAADP + in intact sea urchin eggs elicits long term Ca 2 + oscillations. On the other hand, uncaging threshold amounts of NAADP + produces desensitization. In microsomes, this self-inactivation mechanism exhibits concentration and time dependance. Binding studies show that the NAADP + <b>recaptor</b> is distinct from that of cADPR, and at subthreshold concentrations, NAADP + can fully inactirate subsequent binding to the receptor in a time- dependent manner. Thus, the NAADP +-sensitive Ca 2 + release process has novel regulatory characteristics, which are distinguishable from Ca 2 + release mediated by either IP 3 or cADPR. This battery of release mechanisms may provide the necessary versatility for cells to respond to diverse signals that lead to Ca 2 + mobilization. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Avian {{influenza}} such as H 5 N 1 could infect {{humans and}} cause great health concern {{due to its}} high mortality rate. In March 2013, a novel reassortant avian-origin influenza A (H 7 N 9) virus was found in several patients with severe respiratory illness in China. Since then, at least 82 people in China have been infected with this new virus and 17 have died from this virus. The question of how these people were infected with this virus and whether this virus will spread among people remains an urgent topic for research. This study took an early investigation of this virus  by comparing the collected viral genome sequences  of 2013 H 7 N 9 inChinaagainst those of previous avian H 7 N 9 and examined the receptor binding specificity of this new virus. This virus {{was found to be}} very different from the previous avian H 7 N 9 viruses and surprisingly many of the internal proteins of 2013 H 7 N 9 from the avian and human hosts in China were either identical or similar. Our analysis of the HA protein of this virus implied that the current strains of 2013 H 7 N 9 inChina displayed avian type receptors as their primary binding preference and human type receptors as secondary. For pandemic risk assessment, we also detected 23 mutations, including a few well known for host adaptation, in the HA 1 domain of the HA protein from this virus. Each mutation was quantified for its impact on the <b>recaptor</b> binding selection using a bioinformatics approach. Collectively these current mutations tended to decrease the HA binding affinity for avian type recaptors and increase that for human type receptors, which could enhance the ability of this virus to infect humans. </p...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} oxymatrine on the gene expression profile of hepatic stellate cell (HSC) and provide novel insights into the mechanism of oxymatrine against hepatic fibrosis. Methods: HSC was isolated from normal SD by in situ perfusion of collagenase and pronase and density Nycodenz gradient centrifugation. MTT colorimetry was used to study the effect of oxymatrine on the proliferation of HSC. Total RNA and mRNA of quiescent HSC, culture-activated HSC and oxymatrine treated HSC were extracted. Effect of oxymatrine on HSC gene expression profile was detected by oligonucleotide microarray analysis with Affymetrix gene chip rat U 230 A. Differentially expressed genes were annotated with Gene Ontology (GO) and analyzed with Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Results: Oxymatrine could inhibit the proliferation of HSC in a dose-dependent manner. A total of 4641 differentially expressed genes were identified by cDNA chip between activated and quiescent HSC, among which 2702 genes were upregulated, and 1939 genes were down-regulated in activated HSC. cDNA microarray uncovered downregulation of 56 genes in response to oxymatrine, the representative genes including alpha 2 type I procollagen, alpha- 1 type I collagen, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, interleukin 1 beta, early growth response 1, chemokine ligand 2, chemokine ligand 1, CTGF, TGF β 1. The most enriched GO terms included response to wounding, inflammatory response, cell migration, cell motility, wound healing, TGF β receptor signaling pathway. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that oxymatrine affected the ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, cytokine-cytokine <b>recaptor</b> interaction, TGF β signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway. There were 37 genes upregulated significantly following oxymatrine treatment. The most enriched GO terms included oxidation reduction, negative regulation of lipoprotein oxidation, regulation of lipoprotein oxidation, steroid metabolic process, regulation of lipase activity. Six genes were confirmed with QPCR, consistent with microarray. Conclusion: The mechanism of oxymatrine in inhibiting liver fibrogenesis is associated with multi-genes and multi-pathways regulation. </span...|$|E
