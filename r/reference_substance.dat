ICCVAM recently recommended performance standards for the BG 1 Luc estrogen receptor (ER) transactivation (TA) test method. The performance standards were based on results from an international interlaboratory validation study, and include essential test method components, <b>reference</b> <b>substances,</b> and standards for accuracy and reliability. Essential components include: a cell line that endogenously expresses human ERs and is stably transfected with a reporter gene, use of a solvent miscible with cell culture media, a defined concentration limit for agonist (1 mM) or antagonist (10 µM) testing, evaluation of cytotoxicity, a reference estrogen, anti-estrogen, and positive and solvent controls. The <b>reference</b> <b>substances</b> should cover the range of ER responses, both positive and negative. ICCVAM selected 34 agonist and 10 antagonist <b>reference</b> <b>substances.</b> The evaluation of these <b>reference</b> <b>substances</b> yielded the following results for agonists: accuracy of 100 % (34 / 34), sensitivity of 100 % (27 / 27), specificity of 100 % (7 / 7), a false positive rate of 0 % (0 / 7), and a false negative rate of 0 % (0 / 27). For antagonists, results were: accuracy of 100 % (10 / 10), sensitivity of 100 % (3 / 3), specificity of 100 % (7 / 7), a false positive rate of 0 % (0 / 7), and a false negative rate of 0 % (0 / 3).

40|$|As {{a result}} of testing {{experience}} several OECD member countries proposed the updating of the OECD Test Guideline 107 and {{the inclusion of the}} HPLC method. The OECD Updating Panel reviewed all comments and drafted an improved and for OECD member countries widely acceptable version of the HPLC test method. Before finally adopting the HPLC test method a validation by means of an OECD Laboratory Intercomparison Test was necessary. The most important determinants for a reliable experimental result were shown to be choice and the number of <b>reference</b> <b>substances,</b> whereas the dead-time determination, the use of a guard column, the choice of the analytical column, and the temperature have little or no effect on the result. Using an appropriately buffered methanol/water eluent with a water content of at least 25 % and at least six <b>reference</b> <b>substances</b> with well-established partition coefficients covering the value to be determined, the log P sub ow of the test substance can be obtained within +- 0. 5.

50|$|Specific {{gravity is}} {{the ratio of}} the density of a {{substance}} to the density of a reference substance; equivalently, it is {{the ratio of the}} mass of a substance to the mass of a <b>reference</b> <b>substance</b> for the same given volume. Apparent specific gravity is the ratio of the weight of a volume of the substance to the weight of an equal volume of the <b>reference</b> <b>substance.</b> The <b>reference</b> <b>substance</b> is nearly always water at its densest (4°C) for liquids; for gases it is air at room temperature (21°C). Nonetheless, the temperature and pressure must be specified for both the sample and the reference. Pressure is nearly always 1 atm (101.325 kPa). Temperatures for both sample and reference vary from industry to industry. In British beer brewing, the practice for specific gravity as specified above is to multiply it by 1000. Specific gravity is commonly used in industry as a simple means of obtaining information about the concentration of solutions of various materials such as brines, hydrocarbons, sugar solutions (syrups, juices, honeys, brewers wort, must etc.) and acids.|$|E

50|$|Relative density can be {{calculated}} directly by measuring the density of a sample and dividing it by the (known) density of the <b>reference</b> <b>substance.</b> The density of the sample is simply its mass divided by its volume. Although mass is easy to measure, the volume of an irregularly shaped sample can {{be more difficult to}} ascertain. One method is to put the sample in a water-filled graduated cylinder and read off how much water it displaces. Alternatively the container can be filled to the brim, the sample immersed, and the volume of overflow measured. The surface tension of the water may keep a significant amount of water from overflowing, which is especially problematic for small samples. For this reason it is desirable to use a water container with as small a mouth as possible.|$|E

40|$|Background: Reprocessing {{of medical}} devices, being {{classified}} as semi-critical B is recommended {{to be performed}} in a washer-disinfector. In order to estimate, whether the expected contaminants of the various medical disciplines can be effectively removed by this washer-disinfector, different so called “test soils” have been proposed to be tested as a marker of cleaning efficacy of the disinfector. Todays described test soils are optimised for the testing of contaminations occurring in surgical procedures, but not for dental procedures. Methods: In this study the test soils being proposed in the EN 15883 - 5 (e. g. KMNE soil, recipe by Koller and coagulated sheep’s blood) were compared with 8 <b>reference</b> <b>substances</b> used in the conservative-prosthetic dental practice. The success of the cleaning efficacy in the washer-disinfector was checked visually and by determining the residual protein concentration on the contaminated instruments after the cleaning procedure. Results: It could be shown that {{in contrast to the}} proposed test soils of the EN 15883 - 5, the used <b>reference</b> <b>substances</b> of the dental practice could not be removed by the washer-disinfector. Removal of these <b>reference</b> <b>substances</b> was only possible after manual or ultrasonic cleaning. Conclusions: Since blood plays a subordinate role as a contaminant of instruments during conservative-prosthetic dental treatments, testing of the cleaning efficacy of the washer-disinfector with test soils according to the proposals of the EN 15883 - 5 is not representative in this discipline of dentistry.
