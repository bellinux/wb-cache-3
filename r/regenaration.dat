We aimed to evaluate whether longer duration of PVL has any additive benefit on <b>regenaration</b> speed, weight, biochemical, histological examination and mortality, before major hepatectomies in rats. Methods: One-hundred and twenty Wistar Albino rats were divided into four groups (PVL, PVL+Hx, Hx, Sham+Hx). Group I (PVL), Group II (PVL + Hx); 70 % Hx and relaparotomy after 21 days from PVL, Group III (Hx); 70 % Hx, Group IV (Sham + Hx); 70 % Hx after 21 days from Sham ligation. Hepatic tissue regeneration speed, weight, liver function tests and histological examination were evaluated on postoperatively 3 rd, 7 th, 14 th and 21 st days. Also, mortality rate was evaluated. Results: The regeneration speed increased in all groups except PVL+Hx. The weight of all rats decreased on postoperative 3 rd day, however, then reached nearly preoperative values on 7 th day and the higher values were seen on 28 th day in all groups.

40|$|The {{carbon cycle}} is the {{chemical}} engine that provides power and weight to most living things, besides being {{closely related to}} the regulation of the global atmosphere and, consequently, climate. Growing forests absorb and fix large amounts of carbon and can still contribute significantly to the recovery of important ecosystem services. In this regard, this study focuses on simulating the dynamics of carbon sequestration in a mosaic of different vegetation area by the use of two images from Landsat TM, for the years 1993 and 2009. Through these images, we could analyze the changes occurred in the use and land cover, especially in areas of forests, grassland and bare soil, elements that absorb more carbon from among the ranks and in a backdrop of vegetation succession. Field validations were made in the cities of Niterói and Marica, regions with large degraded areas and remaining forest lands. From these first results it was possible to simulate the dynamics of vegetation cover by the Markov model associated with cellular automata in order to obtain a projection of carbon stocks. Despite the inaccuracy of the model and the uncertainties associated with forest <b>regenaration</b> cover classification and its biomass this was a first approach for obtaining information on vegetable biomass in the future.

40|$|Transformation of {{epithelial}} cells into connective tissue cells (epithelial-mesenchymal transition, EMT) {{is a complex}} mechanism involved in tumor metastasis, and in normal embryogenesis, while type II EMT is mainly associated with inflammatory events and tissue <b>regenaration.</b> In this study we examined type II EMT at the ultrastructural and molecular level during the inflammatory process induced by Freund’s adjuvant treatment in rat mesenteric mesothelial cells. We found that upon the inflammatory stimulus mesothelial cells lost contact with the basal lamina and with each other, and were transformed into spindle-shaped cells. These morphological changes were accompanied by release of interleukins IL- 1 alpha,- 1 beta and IL- 6 and by secretion of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) into the peritoneal cavity. Mesothelial cells also expressed estrogen receptor alpha (ER-a) as shown by immunolabeling at the light and electron microscopical levels, {{as well as by}} quantitative RT-PCR. The mRNA level of ER-a showed an inverse correlation with the secretion of TGF-b. At the cellular and subcellular levels ER-a was colocalized with the coat protein caveolin- 1 and was found in the plasma membrane of mesothelial cells, in caveolae close to multivesicular bodies (MVBs) or in the membrane of these organelles, suggesting that ER-a is internalized via caveola-mediated endocytosis during inflammation. We found asymmetric, thickened, electron dense areas on the limiting membrane of MVBs (MVB plaques) indicating that these sites may serve as platforms for collecting and organizing regulatory proteins. Our morphological observations and biochemical data can contribute to for...|$|E
40|$|Sandalwood (Santalum album Linn.) {{is one of}} {{the flora}} that are {{commonly}} used as rehabilitation species, known as a plant that can grow in a lack of nutrient soil, and has a high economic value of santalol oil. This plant is indigenous in East Nusa Tenggara but it has a natural <b>regenaration</b> in some areas of Gunungkidul Yogyakarta, including in Petir Village, Rongkop, Gunungkidul. Morphological variation of Sandalwood in this area was relatively high. This research aimed to describe and classify sandalwood variations that exist in the research site based on the morphological characters. The materials used in this study were (1) sandalwood as the target species (including generative and vegetative organs) with purposive sampling and (2) Ximenia americana as the outgroup species. Data were analyzed using description and phylogeny analysis using maximum parsimony method with morphological markers. Morphological characters of Sandalwoods were varied in size and leave shapes, flowers perigonium, lobes shapes, appendices shapes, stem color, shapes and fruit size. There were two characters that have not been described in the previous sources in Indonesia, form of leaves (oblong and oval) and orange color of perigonium. Phylogeny results showed that a small leaf sandalwood character was closer to the outgroup character. Diagnostic characters explicitly classified small leaf size and leaf size large. Size of small leaf was from 2. 8 - 7. 7 cm to 1. 1 - 2. 2 cm and from 7. 9 - 10 cm to 3. 1 - 4 cm for large leaf. Leaf form and colour of flower variation was found in each group of leaf size...|$|E

Special attention {{is given to}} the major urban centres, for the most related to nationale and/or Ue policy (Ce, 2003; Ce, 2004). A number of important questions are emerging between the reinforcement of the bigger areas, both metropolitan and urban, and the smaller centres. Moreover, according with different institutional actors it would be better more balanced process of anthropization because environmental and social reasons (APAT, 2004). In Calabria there are very few towns with more then 15. 000 residents, often they are isolated and in the internal land. It requires to connect these areas by network, to push the diffusion of innovation and technology, to build up the "educated technology" (Del Nord, 1991). As said in other place (Aragona, 2003), the region is becoming to partecipate to the global village and the Ue (Ue, 1994; 1995; 1996) have policies and areas of implementation (Information Society, POR Calabbria 2000 - 20006; RIS+ 2001 - 2002). The paper faces a number of questions continuing such a topic. How are changing some of these areas that have implemented the technological innovation? Which impact are making the strategies and the choices on the spatial, functional and social context. The social effectiveness related to the quality life, said by Gasparini (1990) does it better? Could it be the outcome due to the absence of concentrated localization as is the case of other territorial areas marked by the "reticular" network (Dematteis, 1990) ? Above all it requires to evaluate, said that the technological facilities are present enough, the role plays by the innovation as engine for both the cultural and awareness growth. Push for and knowledge that overcomes the mere informatization and suggestes the e-government: a formation and information path dedicated to build up new tools for local action and planning in the global competition.

40|$|Abstract Phalaenopsis orchids are {{recognized}} as the most popular orchid genus in the world, especially in horticultural industry due to their large, colorful, and durable flowers {{as well as their}} wider adaptability to room conditions. The characteristics of seedling propagated by vegetative means are not uniform; therefore, propagation through tissue culture is desirable. Although the micro propagation of Phalaenopsis has shown very good development, but the wide spread of micro propagation still limited due some problems such as the exudation of phenolic compounds, the PGR concentration, the media used, somaclonal variation, the chosen explants, etc. This paper endeavor to include some important investigations based on the common explants used; leaf and flower stalk.   Keywords: Micropropagation, Phalaenopsis, leaf explant, flower stalk   References • Anonymous.
