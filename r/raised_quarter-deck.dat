6000|$|The long low waist {{was packed}} {{full of the}} slaves, some five or six to each oar, and down the centre, between the two banks, the English could see the slave-drivers {{walking up and down}} a long gangway, whip in hand. A <b>raised</b> <b>quarter-deck</b> at the stern held more soldiers, the {{sunlight}} flashing merrily upon their armor and their gun-barrels; as they neared, the English could hear plainly the cracks of the whips, and the yells as of wild beasts which answered them; the roll and rattle of the oars, and the loud [...] "Ha!" [...] of the slaves which accompanied every stroke, and the oaths and curses of the drivers; while a sickening musky smell, as of a pack of kennelled hounds, came down the wind from off those dens of misery. No wonder if many a young heart shuddered as it faced, for the first time, the horrible reality of those floating hells, the cruelties whereof had rung so often in English ears, from the stories of their own countrymen, who had passed them, fought them, and now and then passed years of misery on board of them.

2500|$|The Australian cruiser reached Emden around 16:00. The Germans' battle ensign {{was still}} flying, {{generally}} {{a sign that}} a ship intends to continue fighting. Sydney signalled [...] "Do you surrender?" [...] in international code by both lights and flag-hoist. The signal was not understood, and Emden responded with [...] "What signal? No signal books". The instruction to surrender was repeated by Sydney in plain morse code, then after there was no reply, the message [...] "Have you received my signal?" [...] was sent. With no response forthcoming, and operating {{under the assumption that}} Emden could still potentially fire, launch torpedoes, or use small arms against any boarding parties, Glossop ordered Sydney to fire two salvoes into the wrecked ship. This attack killed 20 German personnel. The ensign was pulled down and burned, and a white sheet was <b>raised</b> over the <b>quarter-deck</b> as a flag of surrender. During the battle, 130 personnel aboard Emden were killed, and 69 were wounded, four of the latter died of their wounds.|$|R
