5|$|In either 549 or 550, the Gepids and Lombards again marched {{against each}} other but, {{according}} to Procopius, both armies panicked and no battle took place.

5|$|In {{the months}} before departure, funds for the {{expedition}} became harder to acquire. Because of limited public interest, newspaper deals were cancelled and parliament refused a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> further 25,000kroner.

5|$|A {{meeting of}} the {{parliamentary}} party was held on 15 September at which {{the issue of the}} presidential election was raised. Unexpectedly, one of the party's senators, Labhrás Ó Murchú, sought nominations to run as an independent candidate. This was widely seen as a challenge to the authority of Micheál Martin. The extended meeting broke up without agreement. The parliamentary party met again on 20 September. Senator Ó Murchú withdrew his <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> nomination and a motion was passed that the party's Oireachtas members would not nominate or endorse any candidate. The decision was seen as a severe blow to the attempts to secure a nomination by David Norris and Dana Rosemary Scallon who were expected to need signatures from individual Fianna Fáil members.|$|E
5|$|After {{developer}} MachineGames was founded, {{the employees}} all began brainstorming ideas, and pitching them to publishers. In June 2009, MachineGames owner ZeniMax Media acquired id Software {{and all of}} its property, including Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein. Bethesda Softworks, who had previously declined a pitch from MachineGames, suggested that they develop a new game from a franchise acquired by ZeniMax. MachineGames inquired about developing a new game in the Wolfenstein series; the studio visited id Software, who approved of MachineGames' <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new Wolfenstein game. By November 2010, paperwork was signed, allowing MachineGames to develop Wolfenstein: The New Order. Preliminary development lasted approximately three years.|$|E
5|$|Although O'Malley was {{loyal to}} his {{employees}}, {{he did not}} take kindly to demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, he made it clear to the press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in the national media. There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and showed up in the spring to find out his salary. O'Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.|$|E

However, the company later denied that it planned to purchase the club. In 2015 reports emerged that MLSE was investigating taking over the bankrupt Parma F.C. of Italy's Serie A.|$|E

Billie was developed in response to The WB's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new character, and was originally intended to expand the show {{in a new direction}} for a possible ninth season or a spin-off series. The opinions of media outlets were divided on whether she should return for a Charmed reboot or a cast reunion.|$|E

In the absence of Lennox, and with no evidence presented, Bothwell was acquitted after a seven-hour trial on 12 April. A week later, Bothwell managed to convince {{more than two dozen}} lords and bishops to sign the Ainslie Tavern Bond, in which they agreed to support his aim to marry the queen.|$|E

5|$|Despite his numbers, rumors were {{swirling}} {{about his}} weight {{and its effect}} on his knees and his <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> trade out of Chicago. On December 8, Smith, the team's career leader in saves, was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitchers Al Nipper and Calvin Schiraldi. Nipper pitched only 104 more innings in the majors, and Schiraldi was out of baseball before age 30. Smith, meanwhile, registered nearly 300 saves after the trade. The trade started Smith on a journey involving seven teams in eight seasons, which may have hurt his chances in the Baseball Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Herrmann {{used the}} lowered music budget to his {{advantage}} by writing for a string orchestra rather than a full symphonic ensemble, contrary to Hitchcock's <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> jazz score. He thought of the single tone color of the all-string soundtrack {{as a way of}} reflecting the black-and-white cinematography of the film. The strings play con sordini (muted) for all the music other than the shower scene, creating a darker and more intense effect. Film composer Fred Steiner, in an analysis of the score to Psycho, points out that string instruments gave Herrmann access to a wider range in tone, dynamics, and instrumental special effects than any other single instrumental group would have.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Rubinstein {{handed over}} the {{directorship}} of the Conservatory to Zaremba.

Tchaikovsky had already promised his Characteristic Dances (then called Dances of the Hay Maidens) from his opera The Voyevoda to the society. In submitting the manuscript (and perhaps mindful of Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev that ended with a <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> word of encouragement should the Dances not be performed.|$|E
