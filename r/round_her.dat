25|$|The {{earliest}} known monument {{is a small}} terracotta {{found in}} Athens, with a dedication to Hecate, in writing of {{the style of the}} 6th century. The goddess is seated on a throne with a chaplet bound <b>round</b> <b>her</b> head; she is altogether without attributes and character, and the main historical value of this work, which is evidently of quite a general type and gets a special reference and name merely from the inscription, is that it proves the single shape to be her earlier form, and her recognition at Athens to be earlier than the Persian invasion.|$|E
25|$|Cairistiona's Rock near Ormaig {{has a more}} gruesome story {{attached}} to it. Cairistiona accused, probably falsely, her sister of stealing a large hunk of cheese, and tried to extract a confession from her, by lowering her off a cliff with a plaid tied <b>round</b> <b>her</b> neck. The plaid slipped, and ended up strangling her sister, which she had never intended to do.

500|$|According to Waley, Murasaki may {{not have}} been unhappy with court life in general but bored in Shōshi's court. He speculates she would have {{preferred}} to serve with the Lady Senshi, whose household seems to have been less strict and more light-hearted. In her diary, Murasaki wrote about Shōshi's court, [...] " [...] has gathered <b>round</b> <b>her</b> a number of very worthy young ladies... Her Majesty is beginning to acquire more experience of life, and no longer judges others by the same rigid standards as before; but meanwhile her Court has gained a reputation for extreme dullness".|$|E

500|$|Another {{factor was}} {{the fate of}} Sophia Girton, found guilty of coining. [...] Hammett's bill was {{introduced}} only four days before Girton's fate was to be decided, but a petition for her respite from burning, supported by another sheriff of London (either Thomas Baker or William Newman) and brought to King George III's notice by William Grenville, proved successful. [...] Devereaux suggests that her impending fate lent weight to the eventual outcome of Hammett's bill, which was to abolish the burning of women for treason through the Treason Act 1790. [...] Christian Murphy, who at her execution in 1789 was [...] "drest in a clean striped gown, a white ribbon, and a black ribbon <b>round</b> <b>her</b> cap", was the last woman in England to be burned.|$|E

500|$|When frogs mate, {{the male}} climbs {{on the back}} of the female and wraps his fore limbs <b>round</b> <b>her</b> body, either behind the front legs or just in front of the hind legs. This {{position}} is called amplexus and may be held for several days. The male frog has certain hormone-dependent secondary sexual characteristics. These include [...] the development of special pads on his thumbs in the breeding season, to give him a firm hold. The grip of the male frog during amplexus stimulates the female to release eggs, usually wrapped in jelly, as spawn. In many species the male is smaller and slimmer than the female. Males have vocal cords and make a range of croaks, particularly in the breeding season, and in some species they also have vocal sacs to amplify the sound.|$|E
