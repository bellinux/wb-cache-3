5|$|At {{the end of}} 1282, Ladislaus laid siege to Borostyánkő (now Bernstein im Burgenland in Austria), {{which was}} held by the Kőszegis. The Kőszegis resisted, forcing the king to lift the siege in early 1283. Ladislaus even <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> Ivan Kőszegi and {{appointed}} him palatine before 6 July. Ladislaus abandoned his wife, Isabella, and settled among the Cumans {{by the end of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|Responding to Baron d'Holbach's Système de la Nature (1770) and David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (1779) {{as well as}} {{the works}} of the French philosophers, Priestley {{maintained}} that materialism and determinism could be <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> a belief in God. He criticised those whose faith was shaped by books and fashion, drawing an analogy between the scepticism of educated men and the credulity of the masses.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} view of the myth's end focuses on Horus's sole triumph. In this version, Set is not <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> his rival, but utterly defeated, and sometimes he is exiled from Egypt or even destroyed. His defeat and humiliation is more pronounced in sources from later periods of Egyptian history, when he was increasingly equated with disorder and evil, and the Egyptians no longer saw him {{as an integral part}} of natural order.|$|E

5|$|After {{several more}} French {{attempts}} at conciliation had failed, in September 1664 Marguerite Louise left her apartment in Palazzo Pitti, refusing to return. As a result, Cosimo moved her into Villa di Lappeggi. {{where she was}} watched by forty soldiers, and where six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere because it was feared she would abscond. The following year, she changed tack, and was <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> the Grand Ducal family. That particular reconciliation collapsed, however, after the birth in 1667 of Anna Maria Luisa.|$|E
5|$|Béla's long-time favorite, Andrew, Archbishop of Kalocsa, insulted {{him around}} 1178. Béla soon {{deprived}} {{him and his}} supporter, the Provost of Székesfehérvár Chapter, of their offices and seized the Archbishop's revenues. Pope Alexander III punished Béla with ecclesiastic sanctions, but Béla <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> Archbishop Lucas of Esztergom, who absolved him and excommunicated Andrew of Kalocsa. The conflict ended with a compromise mediated by the Holy See: Andrew asked Béla to pardon him, and Béla restored him to his position of Archbishop.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in Sussex Wilfrid was <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> Archbishop Theodore; the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi says that Theodore {{expressed}} a desire for Wilfrid to succeed him at Canterbury. Wilfrid {{may have been involved}} in founding monasteries near Bath as well as in other parts of Sussex, but the evidence backing this is based on the wording used in the founding charters resembling wording used by Wilfrid in other charters, not on any concrete statements that Wilfrid was involved.|$|E
5|$|In 1143, Nigel became {{involved}} in a quarrel with the powerful Henry of Blois. Charges of depriving a priest of a church, giving church property to laymen, and encouraging sedition were brought against Nigel, and {{he was forced to}} go to Rome to defend himself, only reaching Rome in 1144. He did not return to his diocese until 1145. He probably accompanied Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who went to Rome around this time on separate business. While he was in Rome, Pope Lucius II issued a number of rulings in Nigel's favor, ordering his restitution to Ely. He was then finally <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> Stephen by paying a fine of £200 and offering his son Richard fitzNeal as a hostage. While Nigel was at Rome, Ely was attacked by the king's forces. The monks sent to Geoffrey de Mandeville for aid, and Geoffrey came and occupied the Isle of Ely, while the king's forces occupied the lands of the diocese outside the Isle. Both occupying forces did damage to the lands of the diocese and the cathedral chapter. The monks, in the Liber Eliensis, complained that Nigel had taken items from the church to finance his trip to Rome, and that they were required to help contribute to the bribe when Nigel was <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> Stephen.|$|E

Nunn <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> his son, and when Steve ran for governor in 2003, Louie supported him.

The rival sultans as-Salih Ayyub and Ismail attempted to ally with the Crusaders against the other. In 1244, the breakaway Ayyubids of Syria allied with the Crusaders and confronted the coalition of as-Salih Ayyub and the Khwarizmids at Hirbiya, near Gaza.

5|$|A {{conflict}} between the new papal legate, Peter of Capua, and the Latin Patriarch of Antioch, Peter of Angoulême, who had become Raymond-Roupen's supporter, ended with the excommunication of the patriarch. Exploiting the situation {{to get rid of}} his opponent, Bohemond replaced Peter of Angoulême with the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, SymeonII {{with the support of the}} commune in early 1207. Peter of Angoulême was <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> the legate, excommunicated Bohemond and the commune, and then persuaded some nobles to rise up against Bohemond, forcing him to take refuge in the citadel. Leo entered Antioch, but Bohemond collected his forces and defeated the Armenians. Peter of Angoulême was captured and died of drink deprivation in his prison.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} {{powerful}} lords—including the Šubići, Kőszegis and Csáks—urged CharlesII of Naples {{to send his}} grandson, the 12-year-old Charles Robert, to Hungary {{in order to become}} king. The young Charles Robert disembarked in Split in August 1300. Most Croatian and Slavonian lords and all Dalmatian towns but Trogir recognized him as king before he marched to Zagreb. The Kőszegis and Matthew Csák, however, were shortly <b>reconciled</b> <b>with</b> Andrew, preventing Charles' success. Andrew's envoy to the Holy See noted that Pope Boniface VIII did not support Charles Robert's adventure, either. Andrew, who had been in poor health for a while, was planning to capture his opponent, but he died in Buda Castle on 14 January 1301. According to historians Attila Zsoldos and Gyula Kristó, the contemporaneous gossip suggesting that Andrew was poisoned cannot be proved.|$|E
