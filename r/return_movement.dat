50|$|According to Donald Levine, the Afro-Asiatic (Hamito-Semitic) {{language}} family likely {{arose in}} either the eastern Sahara or southwestern Ethiopia. Early Afro-Asiatic populations speaking proto-Semitic, proto-Cushitic and proto-Omotic languages would have diverged by {{the fourth or fifth}} millennium BC. Shortly afterwards, the proto-Cushitic and proto-Omotic groups would have settled in the Ethiopian highlands, with the proto-Semitic speakers crossing the Sinai Peninsula into Asia Minor. A later <b>return</b> <b>movement</b> of peoples from South Arabia would have introduced the Semitic languages to Ethiopia. Based on archaeological evidence, the presence of Semitic speakers in the territory date to sometime before 500 BC. Linguistic analysis suggests the presence of Semitic languages in Ethiopia as early as 2000 BC. Levine indicates {{that by the end of}} that millennium, the core inhabitants of Greater Ethiopia would have consisted of swarthy Caucasoid ("Afro-Mediterranean") agropastoralists speaking Afro-Asiatic languages of the Semitic, Cushitic and Omotic branches.|$|E
50|$|Another way {{of saying}} {{this is that the}} faster the {{switching}} from the eccentric to the concentric contraction, the greater will be the force produced and the greater the <b>return</b> <b>movement.</b> The speed of the switching is extremely fast, 0.20 seconds or less. For example, high-level sprinters execute the switch from the eccentric contraction that occurs when the foot hits the ground to the concentric contraction when the foot breaks contact with the ground in less than 0.10 seconds. In world-class sprinters, the time is approximately 0.08 seconds.The exact platform height used by most athletes in the depth jump should be less than 30 in {{in the early stages of}} training. Most athletes start at approximately 12 in after doing some jump training. They then gradually work up to 20 in and then to 30 inches depending upon how well the jumps are executed. The main criterion is that the athlete is jumping as high as possible on every jump.|$|E

40|$|When {{searching for}} a target with eye movements, saccades are planned and {{initiated}} while the visual information is still being processed, so that subjects often make saccades away from the target and then {{have to make an}} additional return saccade. Presumably, the cost of the additional saccades is outweighed by the advantage of short fixations. We previously showed that when the cost of passing the target was increased, by having subjects manually move a window through which they could see the visual scene, subjects still passed the target and made <b>return</b> <b>movements</b> (with their hand). When moving a window in this manner, the eyes and hand follow the same path. To find out whether the hand still passes the target and then returns when eye and hand movements are uncoupled, we here compared moving a window across a scene with moving a scene behind a stationary window. We ensured that the required movement of the hand was identical in both conditions. Subjects found the target faster when moving the window across the scene than when moving the scene behind the window, but at the expense of making larger <b>return</b> <b>movements.</b> The relationship between the <b>return</b> <b>movements</b> and movement speed when comparing the two conditions was the same as the relationship between these two when comparing different window sizes. We conclude that the hand passing the target and then returning is not directly related to the eyes doing so, but rather that moving on before the information has been fully processed is a general principle of visuomotor control. © 2009 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

50|$|On {{the morning}} of October 11, 1862, Stuart's men began their <b>return</b> <b>movement</b> along a {{different}} route to the east by way of Cashtown, Pennsylvania and into Maryland through Emmitsburg, Maryland {{on their way back}} to Virginia. The rain from the previous day left the ground wet and the 5-mile (8-kilometer) long column raised no dust from which they might be detected. They rode within 8 mi of the small town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania on their way. At Emmitsburg, Maryland, a pro-Confederate crowd welcomed the raiders, who did not linger but quickly moved on toward Frederick, Maryland. They captured a Union courier about 6 mi south of Emmitsburg with information which disclosed some of the Union cavalry movements, allowing Stuart to change his route again to avoid Union troops at Frederick, but also assuring him that his location was not definitely known. Confederate troopers who had lived in the vicinity guided Stuart on back roads to avoid being observed by Union scouts. Stuart's longer return route to the east and south allowed him to avoid any troops that might be waiting for his return along his original, more hilly, route, and enabled him to again completely circle McClellan's army.|$|E

Further, the results show that an increase in spot trading activity decreases spot and futures return volatility. However, a similar increase in futures trading activity increases futures return volatility but has no net impact on the spot return volatility. The results are consistent with the view that an investor trading in the futures market needs to consider the <b>return</b> <b>movements</b> in both spot and futures markets and the volume movements only in futures market.

To minimise the modifying effects of somatosensory input on the response, low-intensity (0. 3 – 0. 5 mA) GVS was applied for 8 s while subjects stood on foam rubber with the feet together and strapped to the floor. The response had three phases: (i) a rapid movement during the first second, (ii) a slower movement that persisted throughout the stimulus, and (iii) a rapid partial <b>return</b> <b>movement</b> after GVS stopped.

40|$|Purpose: Results from {{previous}} studies (e. g. Loomis et al., JEP, 1993) suggest that proprioceptive cues {{play a major role}} in human homing behaviour. We conducted triangle completion experiments in virtual environments to measure homing performance based solely on visual cues. Methods: Subjects were seated in the centre of a large half-cylindrical 180 ° projection screen and steered smoothly through the simulated scene using mouse buttons. Experiments were conducted in two environments: an extended volume filled with random blobs (inducing strong vection), and a photorealistic town containing distinct landmarks. On each trial, subjects had to return to their starting point after moving outwards along two prescribed segments (40 m long, subtending a 30 ° [...] 150 ° horizontal angle) of an imaginary triangle. To exclude scene-matching as a homing strategy, the simulated environment was modified to a different but similar one just before the subject started the <b>return</b> <b>movement.</b> Results: We found strong systematic errors in distance travelled but only small deviations in turning angles. After some practice the variability (standard deviation) of the responses typically dropped to roughly 10 m for distance and 10 degree for turns (lower variability for town than for blobs-scene). Omitting the scene modification before the <b>return</b> <b>movement</b> resulted in nearly perfect performance, stressing the dominant role of piloting under natural conditions. Exchanging the mouse interface for a more realistic bicycle interface, thus introducing proprioceptive cues for side-ways tilt and pedal resistance, reduced the systematic error in rotation but also increased the overall variability.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to examine {{dynamics}} and consequences of geographical <b>return</b> <b>movements</b> in two North-South contexts based on migrants' biographies. The thesis examines the consequences of return migration {{in terms of social}} mobility, meanings of return and the shaping of identity-place relationships for the subjects of migration. Categories of return were identified and related to evolving migration processes in the two case studies of long term labour migration and political exile respectively. The concept of 'narrative identity' was used to analyse the shaping of the migration biographies and to examine the ways migrants made sense of their experiences of emigration/exile and return. In a further step the narrative identities were discussed in relation to examples of public narratives in the two contexts. The dissertation's case study of US-Mexican migration showed that geographical return took different shapes at the local level as the migration process evolved between the studied municipality in Mexico and different destinations in the USA. The initial phase of formative return led to the gradual establishment of a migration tradition and development of a remittance economy. <b>Return</b> <b>movements</b> turned in a later phase into an increasingly trapped migratory pattern of differentiated circulation between the municipality in Mexico and different locations in the USA. The 'narrative identities' of returning migrants were related to family situations (family formation, safety of the family, family commitment), perceptions of real life in Mexico and work identities (respected worker, independent businessman), negative experiences of migration (threat, social degradation, trapped migration), and the search and fulfilment of personal experiences. These narrative identities were contrasted with public narratives, showing the partial incorporation of some public narratives and contrasting senses of self of migrants in relation to 'imposed identities' in both the USA and Mexico. The second case study of the dissertation identified categories of <b>return</b> <b>movements</b> in a context of changing conditions in both Chile and Sweden. Examples of categories were 'conditional return' and 'programmed return' and in the phase of desexilio professional circulation, continued exile and everyday life circulation. The narrative identities of retornados were related to family situations (children's future and education, the extended family and the family vote), Sweden as 'parenthesis' (programmed return, duty to return, political return, personal return), work identities (independent businessman, professional circulation) and experiences of exclusion (foreigner, immigrant, prolonged political exile). The narrative identities of migrants were discussed in relation to larger public narratives about retornados in the Chilean media. digitalisering@um...|$|R
