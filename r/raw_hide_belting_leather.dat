50|$|Tanning is {{the process}} that {{converts}} the protein of the <b>raw</b> <b>hide</b> or skin into a stable material which will not putrefy and is suitable {{for a wide variety}} of end applications. The principal difference between <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> and tanned <b>hides</b> is that <b>raw</b> <b>hides</b> dry out to form a hard inflexible material that can putrefy when re-wetted (wetted back), while tanned material dries out to a flexible form that does not become putrid when wetted back. A large number of different tanning methods and materials can be used; the choice is ultimately dependent on the end application of the leather. The most commonly used tanning material is chromium, which leaves the leather, once tanned, a pale blue colour (due to the chromium), this product is commonly called “wet blue”.|$|R

The process of <b>raw</b> <b>hide</b> desalting is associated with dissolving kinetics of a solid salt adhering {{to the surface and}} inside hairy spaces of hide on the one hand, and on transport of sodium chloride ions from the inner volume of hide mass.
