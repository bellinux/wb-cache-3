5|$|On {{the first}} play after the turnover, Thomas Jones's 52-yard run moved {{the ball to the}} Colts' 5-yard line. Three plays later, <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> threw a 4-yard {{touchdown}} pass to receiver Muhsin Muhammad, giving the Bears a 14–6 lead. After forcing an Indianapolis punt, Chicago lost another turnover when Cedric Benson's fumble was recovered by Colts defensive end Dwight Freeney on the Bears' 43-yard line. Indianapolis subsequently advanced to the 36-yard line, but decided to punt rather than risk a 53-yard field-goal attempt.|$|E
5|$|The Bears {{offense was}} led by quarterback <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman,</b> the team's first round draft pick in 2003. Over the {{previous}} three seasons, Grossman had played in just 8 regular season games due to injuries, but he recovered to start in all 16 games in 2006. By {{the end of the}} season, he finished with 3,193yards and 23 touchdowns, the most by a Bears quarterback since 1995. Grossman had difficulty avoiding turnovers, however, and threw 20 interceptions and lost five fumbles during the year. In the last seven games of the season, he turned the ball over 18 times. Many fans and sports writers expected head coach Lovie Smith to bench him at some point, but Smith insisted that Grossman would be the starter throughout the entire season.|$|E
5|$|There {{has also}} been a surge in the demand for Hester’s jerseys within the Chicago area {{sporting}} stores. Also, Hester was invited to throw the ceremonial opening pitch and sing Take Me Out to the Ball Game at the Chicago Cubs' 2007 home opener. Along with teammates <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> and Tommie Harris, Hester appeared on the February 2007 issue of Sports Illustrated for Kids. His reputation {{has also been}} bolstered by EA Sports' Madden NFL 08, where Hester's perfect 100 speed rating made him the fastest player in the game's history. Hester also appeared in a promotional video for the game. He appeared in commercials for Under Armour in 2008 and 2009. In 2013, Hester outran a cheetah in a race sponsored by National Geographic at Busch Gardens Tampa. The competition consisted of Hester running back and forth on a straight track to simulate laps, while the cheetah ran in a similar but separate track.|$|E
500|$|<b>Rex</b> Daniel <b>Grossman</b> III (born August 23, 1980) is {{a former}} American {{football}} quarterback who played in the National Football League for nine seasons. Grossman played college football for the University of Florida. [...] He was selected by the Chicago Bears {{in the first round}} of the 2003 NFL Draft, and has also played professionally for the NFL's Houston Texans, Washington Redskins, Cleveland Browns, and Atlanta Falcons.|$|R
50|$|Grossman {{was born}} in Bloomington, Indiana in 1980, the son of <b>Rex</b> Daniel <b>Grossman</b> II and Maureen Grossman. Under the {{motivation}} and guidance of his father, he began playing football {{at an early age}} in grade school. He originally started his football career as a running back. Despite his success running the ball, his mother asked his coach to convert him to a quarterback {{while he was in the}} sixth grade.|$|R
5|$|The Browns {{won their}} fifth {{game of the}} season against the Baltimore Colts on a muddy field during a rainstorm. Led by quarterback Y. A. Tittle, the Colts began the scoring on the fourth play of the game with a 78-yard {{touchdown}} pass to Billy Hillenbrand. A few minutes later, the Browns evened the score after a pass from Graham set up a short touchdown run by Edgar Jones. The Colts retook the lead in the second quarter with a field goal by <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> and led 10–7 at the half. Focusing on the running game because of the muddy conditions, the Browns scored a touchdown in the third quarter that put them in the lead for good. Jones, who was returning from a rib injury, finished the day with 61 yards and two touchdowns, while Motley ran for 130 yards. The slippery and windy conditions caused miscues on both sides. Tittle and Motley had fumbles, and Cleveland botched a fake field goal attempt in the second quarter. The final score was 14–10. While the Browns had won their first five games, the San Francisco 49ers were {{at the top of the}} AAFC's eastern division standings, having won all six of their games.|$|E
25|$|Starting QB <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> (2 of 6 for 14 yards) {{left the}} game in the first quarter with a left knee injury.|$|E
25|$|The preseason {{featured}} a brewing quarterback controversy when <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> struggled in his exhibition appearances and newly signed veteran back-up Brian Griese moved the second team offense freely.|$|E
25|$|On December 17, 2010, {{head coach}} Mike Shanahan relegated McNabb {{to the third}} quarterback {{position}} {{for the rest of}} this season, stating that he wanted to evaluate backup <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> in game play.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{off their}} road {{win over the}} Raiders, the Bears flew to Qwest Field for a Week 11 duel with the Seattle Seahawks, in a rematch of last year's NFC divisional game (which took place in Chicago). QB <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> made his first start since Week 3.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{towards the}} future, the Bears allowed rookie quarterback <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> {{to start the}} last three games of the season. Grossman brought the Bears {{victories}} in their final two home games. In the end, the late showing of talent {{was not enough to}} save Dick Jauron's job. He ended up being dismissed from the Bears.|$|E
25|$|On New Year's Eve, the Packers {{traveled}} to Chicago {{to face the}} Bears at Soldier Field. With the new NFL flexible-scheduling intact, the game {{was moved to the}} Sunday night because of playoff implications and the possibility of it being Brett Favre's last game. However, the Packers became ineligible for a playoff bid when the New York Giants clinched a tie-breaker earlier in the day. On the first drive of the game, the Packers drove the ball 75yards, resulting in a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brett Favre to receiver Donald Driver. Later in the first quarter, Packers defensive back Nick Collins intercepted quarterback <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman,</b> returning the ball 55yards for a touchdown. In the second quarter <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> threw his third interception of the game. Patrick Dendy returned the interception 33yards for a touchdown. The Packers finished the half winning 23–0, with their defense forcing four turnovers.|$|E
25|$|The Packers offense {{recorded}} 373yards of offense. Brett Favre completed 21 of 42 passes {{with one}} touchdown and one interception. On defense, the Packers forced six turnovers. Five of the turnovers were interceptions. The Bears starting quarterback <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> recorded only a 0.0 quarterback rating in {{one half of}} play. With the win, the Packers moved to 8–8, improving on their record of 4–12 from the previous year.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season, Stewart {{signed as}} a free agent with the Chicago Bears and was named the starter. After several poor performances in 2003, he was replaced in favor of Chris Chandler. After getting the same results from Chandler, he was reinserted as the starter, before getting benched in favor of rookie <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> after the Bears were eliminated from the playoffs. Stewart was released at the end of the season.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ensuing}} kickoff, Brad Maynard's 51-yard punt gave the Saints {{the ball at}} their own 5-yard line. Two plays later, Brees {{committed}} an intentional grounding penalty in the end zone, resulting in a safety. Two possessions later, Chicago stormed 85 yards in five plays, with quarterback <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> completing four consecutive passes for 73 yards, the last one a 33-yard touchdown pass to Bernard Berrian, increasing their lead to 25–14.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{after going}} 3–2 {{in the preseason}} (with <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> {{suffering}} a broken ankle in their preseason loss to the St. Louis Rams), the Bears named rookie QB Kyle Orton their starter, and their regular season started off poorly. The Bears began {{the season with a}} 1–3 record. Not even a Week 4 Bye could help them, because in Week 5, the Bears lost a hard-fought road game to Trent Dilfer and the Cleveland Browns 20–10.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{off their}} {{overtime}} {{win over the}} Broncos, the Bears stayed at home for a Week 13 intraconference duel with the New York Giants. In the first quarter, Chicago struck first with QB <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> completing a 1-yard TD pass to TE Desmond Clark for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Giants got on the board with RB Derrick Ward. Afterwards, the Bears ended the half with kicker Robbie Gould getting a 35-yard and a 46-yard field goal.|$|E
25|$|However, Shanahan {{suddenly}} reversed {{direction by}} naming veteran backup <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> {{to the starting}} position. In Week 1, Grossman threw for 305 yards and two TD passes as the Redskins crushed the Giants 28-14, ending a six-game losing streak against that team. After beating the Cardinals in Week 2, the Redskins {{got off to a}} surprise 2-0 start. In Week 3, they played the Cowboys on MNF and lost a poorly played game where the latter edged them out with six field goals to win 18-16.|$|E
25|$|Chicago {{running back}} Thomas Jones capped off the opening drive {{of the game}} with a 9-yard {{touchdown}} run. Seahawks receiver Nate Burleson gave his team great field position with a 41-yard kickoff return to the 47-yard line, but the Bears forced Seattle to punt after three plays. Then, after forcing Chicago to punt, Seattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck tied the score with a 16-yard touchdown pass to Burleson on the first play of the second quarter. However, Bears quarterback <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> threw a 68-yard touchdown pass to Bernard Berrian on the first play after the ensuing kickoff, giving his team a 14–7 lead.|$|E
25|$|The Bears {{traveled}} to San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium {{to start the}} 2007 season. They initially succeeded at containing LaDainian Tomlinson, the league's reigning MVP, but received little support from <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> and Cedric Benson. The Chargers drove into Bears' territory on their second drive, but came up empty after Alex Brown blocked a thirty-three-yard field goal. Mike Brown thwarted another Chargers' drive by intercepting Philip Rivers, which was eventually followed by a twenty-seven-yard field goal. However, Grossman drove the team into field goal position, only to throw an interception (the result of a miscue between him and Bernard Berrian) deep within Chargers' territory.|$|E

Williams, Lawrence Wright, Danny Wuerffel, Jack Youngblood.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{off their}} bye week, the Bears flew to McAfee Coliseum for a Week 10 interconference duel with the Oakland Raiders. In the first quarter, Chicago trailed early as Raiders kicker Sebastian Janikowski got a 37-yard field {{goal for the}} only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears tied the game as kicker Robbie Gould kicked a 32-yard field goal for the only score of the period. However, during the period, {{starting}} QB Brian Griese (10/14 for 97 yards) {{had to leave the}} game as his left shoulder was injured during a sack. It would mark the return of QB <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman.</b>|$|E
25|$|After their season-opening {{loss to the}} Chargers, the Bears rebounded {{by winning}} their home opener against the Kansas City Chiefs. Bernard Berrian fumbled on the team's opening drive, but a staunch {{defensive}} effort held the Chiefs at bay, and eventually allowed the Bears to engineer a successful drive. John St. Clair, a reserve offensive tackle, scored the Bears' first offensive touchdown of the season from a one-yard pass from <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman.</b> The team forced the Chiefs to punt on their next drive, which was returned for a touchdown by Devin Hester.The Chiefs scored their first points of the game after Damon Huard threw a sixteen-yard touchdown pass to Dwayne Bowe.|$|E
25|$|For week 14, the Bears {{traveled}} to St. Louis, Missouri {{to play the}} St. Louis Rams. Prior to the game, a quarterback controversy arose between <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> and Brian Griese regarding the Bears’ starting quarterback position. Grossman, who finished the preceding game with a quarterback rating of 1.3, was eager to make a statement, and rebound against the same team which injured him during the previous year's preseason. Grossman rose to the occasion, and spearheaded the Bears to a 42–27 victory over the Rams, while rookie CB Devin Hester had a record-breaking performance. Also, many spectators of the Monday night game may remember Senator Barack Obama's humorous television introduction before kickoff.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{aftermath}} of the team's loss to Dallas, the Bears turned to Brian Griese replace <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman.</b> The change came in an attempt to protect the ball, and reduce turnovers. Nonetheless, the turnovers continued to haunt the team en route to a 37–27 loss against the Detroit Lions. The Lions took a first-quarter lead by blocking a Robbie Gould field-goal attempt, and then using the field position to score a field goal. The Bears' offense struggled to move the ball in the first quarter, and but began to pick up momentum in the second quarter. Griese threw a fifteen-yard touchdown to Muhsin Muhammad, but also threw two interceptions in two red zone visits.|$|E
25|$|The Bears {{closed out}} {{the season with}} a 2–2 record. In Week 15, they won their last regular-season home game against the Atlanta Falcons with a final score of 16–3. During the game, head coach Lovie Smith {{replaced}} Kyle Orton with a fully healed <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman.</b> In the following week, the Bears clinched the division with a dominant performance at Lambeau Field on Christmas Day (the first time the Bears ever played on Christmas). For the first time since 1991, they swept the Packers; they also secured the NFC North Division title. The Bears ended the regular season with an 11–5 record, enough for 2nd place in the NFC and a first-round bye in the playoffs. In addition, Lovie Smith received NFL Coach of the Year honors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, the Bears tied {{the game with}} WR/KR/PR Devin Hester {{returning}} a punt 75 yards for a touchdown. Denver responded with FB Cecil Sapp getting a 5-yard TD run, but afterwards, Hester went right back to work for Chicago as he returned the following kickoff 88 yards for a touchdown. Afterwards, the Broncos replied with QB Jay Cutler completing a 68-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall. In the fourth quarter, Denver increased its lead with Cutler completing a 14-yard TD pass to TE Tony Scheffler. Afterwards, the Bears tied the game with RB Adrian Peterson getting a 4-yard TD run, along with QB <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian. In overtime, Chicago came out on top as Gould made the game-winning 39-yard field goal.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{the second}} half, Brian Griese {{replaced}} <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> at quarterback. The Bears scored their {{first and only}} points of {{the game with a}} 75-yard touchdown pass to receiver Mark Bradley from Brian Griese in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Packers increased their lead with a 46-yard field goal by Dave Rayner. The Bears had the ball only once in the fourth quarter. The drive ended in an interception by Nick Collins, recording his second of the game. Late in the game, Favre was replaced by quarterback Ingle Martin. Favre was carried off the field by Donald Driver, receiving many hugs by players and coaches. In an interview after the game, Favre broke down in tears. It was still at the time unclear whether Favre will retire or return to the Packers, but Favre announced in February that he would return to play with the Packers.|$|E
25|$|During the 2009 off-season, <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> {{achieved}} free-agent {{status and}} left the team, signing with the Houston Texans. The Bears then traded Kyle Orton to the Broncos in exchange for QB Jay Cutler. The regular season began on a not-so-promising note, as Cutler threw 4 picks against the Packers in Week 1. However, the Bears bounced back to go 3–1, including a victory in Week 2 over the defending Super Bowl champion Steelers, but things fell apart quickly after the bye week, with the Bears losing eight of the next ten games, including a loss to the San Francisco 49ers where Cutler threw a career-high five interceptions, including a game-ending pick in the red-zone {{with less than a}} minute left in the game. A 31–7 loss to the Ravens in Week 15 mathematically eliminated them from the playoffs, but the team managed to close out the year by winning the last two matches against the Vikings (a 36–30 overtime win) and Lions (37–23) to finish 7–9.|$|E
25|$|In {{his inaugural}} year, the Bears ended their 2004 {{campaign}} at 5–11. For the first goal, Lovie Smith aimed to defeat their historic rival, the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. However, by Week 7, the Bears recorded a poor starting record of 1–5, {{with the only}} win against Green Bay {{largely due to the}} Week 3 road game loss to the Minnesota Vikings. There, they lost starting quarterback <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> from a season-ending knee injury. From then on, they cycled through three different quarterbacks: Craig Krenzel, Jonathan Quinn, and Chad Hutchinson. After a modest three-game win streak from Week 8 to 10, the Bears capped the streak in their Week 10 (19–17) win over the Tennessee Titans in overtime with a safety. That was the second time in NFL history that a game ended in overtime on a safety. Afterwards, the Bears ended up losing six of the remaining seven games.|$|E
25|$|The {{team won}} their first preseason {{game against the}} Houston Texans by a score of 20–19. The game was {{highlighted}} by a staunch performance from their three quarterbacks. <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> completed eight of ten passes for fifty yards, while his back-up, Brian Griese, went six for seven with seventy-two yards and one touchdown and interception. However, third-string quarterback Kyle Orton played an integral part in their victory. Orton, who played nearly two quarters, completed sixteen of twenty-five passes for 151 yards and a single touchdown. At one point, he had completed twelve consecutive passes. Running back Josh Allen and Orton got the Bears to the Texans' twenty-nine-yard line, where Robbie Gould kicked the game's winning field goal. While the team's defense and offense performed productively, their special teams unit drew skepticism after allowing the Texans to produce several large kick returns. Dave Toub, the Bears' special team coach, blamed the problems on a lack of experience and poor tackling, which have since been properly addressed.|$|E
25|$|The Cowboys' fourteenth {{game was}} an NFC East rivalry rematch against the Redskins at home. In {{the first quarter}} the Cowboys took the lead with kicker David Buehler hitting a 42-yard field goal, {{followed}} by QB Jon Kitna throwing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Miles Austin; then Buehler made a 20-yard field goal to put Dallas up 13–0. The lead was narrowed when QB <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> completed a 19-yard TD pass to RB Ryan Torain, but the Cowboys increased their lead with Kitna making a 14-yard TD pass to TE Jason Witten, followed by RB Tashard Choice getting a 3-yard TD run. The Redskins replied with Grossman getting a 10-yard TD pass to WR Santana Moss, but the Cowboys scored again with Buehler got a 20-yard field goal. Washington managed {{to tie the game}} with Grossman finding Moss and Cooley on a 5-yard TD pass. The Cowboys managed to get the win after Buehler made a 39-yard field goal, settling both records at 5–9.|$|E
25|$|The Panthers got {{the ball}} first and scored quickly. Jamal Robertson {{returned}} the opening kickoff 34 yards to the 40-yard line, and one play later, Delhomme threw a 58-yard touchdown pass to Smith. Later on, Smith's 46-yard reception set up a 20-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter, increasing their lead to 10–0. On their next drive, Carolina {{had a chance to}} increase their lead even more after Delhomme completed passes to Drew Carter for gains of 14 and 29 yards, moving the ball to the Bears 23-yard line. But linebacker Brian Urlacher ended the drive by intercepting a pass from Delhomme at the 10. However, the Panthers forced another punt and scored with a second field goal from Kasay. Bears quarterback <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> completed five passes for 62 yards on a 67-yard drive that ended with a 1-yard touchdown run by Adrian Peterson cutting the score to 13–7. But Carolina stormed right back, driving 51 yards and scoring with Kasay's third field goal on the last play of the first half.|$|E
25|$|The Bears {{traveled}} to the newly opened University of Phoenix Stadium to play the Arizona Cardinals, their former cross-town rivals. While many expected the game a lop-sided affair {{in favor of the}} 5–0 Bears, the Cardinals led the Bears before stumbling in the game’s last quarter. The game marked the Bears’ first Monday Night Football appearance since the 2003 NFL season, and second overall prime-time appearance of the season. The game started on an auspicious note for the Cardinals, as <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> faced a quick three and out after failing to connect to Bernard Berrian on a deep pass. The Cardinals responded offensively when rookie quarterback Matt Leinart threw two touchdowns in the first quarter. As Neil Rackers helped bolster the Cardinals lead with a set of field goals, Grossman continued to struggle and committed four turnovers in the first half alone. By half time, the Cardinals were leading the Bears by a score of 20–0, which was the largest deficit they had faced all season at that point.|$|E
25|$|The Bears {{returned}} home to play a Sunday night match with the Dallas Cowboys. The game was close early as the Bears' Robbie Gould and the Cowboys' Nick Folk each hit field goals {{to make it a}} 3–3 tie at halftime. The Cowboys took the opening drive of the third quarter and ended it with a Tony Romo to Jason Witten touchdown pass. The Bears responded on the ensuing drive with a Cedric Benson goal line plunge. The Cowboys struck again {{before the end of the}} third quarter, Romo connecting on his second touchdown pass, this time to running back Marion Barber. Folk converted a 44-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter, and on the next play from scrimmage, Bears quarterback <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman</b> threw an interception to Cowboys cornerback Anthony Henry, who ran it back for the score. With the lead in hand, the Cowboys proceeded to kill the clock, which they did effectively with Barber, who capped the scoring with a one-yard touchdown run. Barber ended the night with over 100 yards rushing, and Cowboys wide receiver Terrell Owens caught eight passes for 145 yards. The Cowboys improved to 3–0, while the Bears dropped to 1–2.|$|E
25|$|Florida went {{three seasons}} before recapturing an SEC title in 2000. The 1998 Gators lost two games to teams which would {{eventually}} {{meet in the}} first BCS National Championship game: Tennessee and FSU. Florida returned to the SEC Championship in 1999, but lost to Alabama and then Michigan State in the Citrus Bowl. The 2000 team won Spurrier's sixth SEC championship, with one conference loss; Mississippi State defeated the Gators 47–35, breaking Florida's 72-game win streak against unranked teams. Spurrier, frustrated, rotated three quarterbacks (including <b>Rex</b> <b>Grossman).</b> After the game, Mississippi State fans stormed the field and tore down the goalposts (parts of which ended up all over campus). The preseason #1-ranked 2001 Gators appeared ready {{to return to the}} SEC Championship as favorites, but were upset 23–20 by Auburn in a last-minute field goal and lost 34–32 to Tennessee in a game postponed until December due to the September 11 attacks. Florida accepted an invitation to the Orange Bowl, defeating Maryland 56–23. Grossman was runner-up for the Heisman Trophy. In a surprise move, on January 4, 2002 Spurrier stunned Florida fans by resigning as the Gators' head coach; ten days later, he became head coach of the NFL's Washington Redskins.|$|E
