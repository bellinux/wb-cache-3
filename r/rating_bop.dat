50|$|An {{increase}} in the global interest <b>rate</b> shifts the <b>BoP</b> curve upward and causes capital flows out of the local economy. This depreciates the local currency and boosts net exports, shifting the IS curve to the right. Under less than perfect capital mobility, the depreciated exchange <b>rate</b> shifts the <b>BoP</b> curve somewhat back down.Under perfect capital mobility, the BoP curve is always horizontal {{at the level of}} the world interest rate. When the latter goes up, the BoP curve shifts upward by the same amount, and stays there. The exchange rate changes enough to shift the IS curve to the location where it crosses the new BoP curve at its intersection with the unchanged LM curve; now the domestic interest rate equals the new level of the global interest rate.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} abdominal and general obesity on periodontal outcomes in a population-based cohort of Brazilian adults. METHODS: Abdominal and general obesity were assessed in 2009 (n= 1, 720) and 2012 (n= 1, 222). For abdominal obesity, a dichotomous variable was created: 1) eutrophic/lost weight; 2) obese/gained weight; for general obesity a categorical variable was created: 1) eutrophic/lost weight; 2) gained weight; 3) obese. Periodontal outcomes were: 1) Percentage of teeth with bleeding on probing (BOP) and 2) Combination of BOP and Attachment Loss (AL). Hypertension was set as mediator. Marginal structural models (MSM) were used to estimate the controlled direct effect of obesity on periodontal outcomes. RESULTS: 1, 076 participants presented periodontal data. The total effect model showed that those with general obesity in the cohort period presented higher risk of unfavorable periodontal outcomes (RR 1. 45 for AL and BOP in different teeth; RR 1. 84 for AL and BOP in the same tooth). Estimates from MSM revealed an effect of general obesity on AL and BOP in different teeth (RR 1. 44). No effect of general obesity was noted on percentage of BOP. Total effect of abdominal obesity increased the risk of AL and BOP in different teeth (RR 1. 47), AL and BOP in the same tooth (RR 2. 77), and percentage of <b>BOP</b> (<b>Rate</b> Ratio 1. 49). In a MSM, those with abdominal obesity presented greater risk of AL and BOP in the same tooth (RR 2. 16) and percentage of <b>BOP</b> (<b>Rate</b> Ratio 1. 37).

40|$|A 24 -item multidimensional nurse-administered Nursing Home Disabilities Instrument (NHDI) was {{developed}} to measure disabilities in nursing home residents. We present the psychometric features and value of this instru-ment, with the following domains assessed: Mobility, Activities of Daily Living (ADLs), Alertness, Resistance to Nursing Assistance, Incontinence, Cognition, and Perception. Test-retest and interrater reliability was assessed using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Internal consistency was examined by Cronbach's alpha. Criterion validity tests were performed by comparing the scales with scales of the Elderly Residents <b>Rating</b> Scale (<b>BOP).</b> Test-retest reliability correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 63 to 0. 94. Interrater reliability was high for the scales Cognition, Mobility, ADL, and Incontinence (0. 79 to 0. 93), moderate for Resistance (0. 51), and low for Per-ception (0. 33). Cronbach's alpha of the scales was high, ranging from 0. 78 (Alertness) to 0. 93 (Mobility); only Perception showed a low alpha: 0. 54. Criterion validity was high for Cognition, ADL, and Mobility (0. 75 to 0. 78), and moderate for Alertness (0. 59). The NHDI {{appears to be a}} valid and efficient multidimensional instrument for measuring disabilities in nursing home residents.

This was documented by an increased MMSE mean score of 12. 87 - 15. 53, and by a higher median score, rising from 10 to 14 points, on the subset 'fluency' (ADS 6 test). The control group showed no significant improvement, either on the MMSE (mean score of 10. 80 - 11. 00) or on the fluency subtest of the ADS 6 (median scores were 6. 5 - 7 points).

40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{exchange}} rate depreciation on the balance of payments (BOP) in Nigeria over the period 1961 – 2012. The analysis {{is based on a}} multivariate vector error correction framework. A long-term equilibrium relationship was found between <b>BOP,</b> exchange <b>rate</b> and other associated variables. The empirical results are in favour of bidirectional causality between BOP and other variables employed. Results of the generalized impulse response functions suggest that one standard deviation innovation on exchange <b>rate</b> reduces positive <b>BOP</b> in the medium and long term, while results of the variance decomposition indicate that a significant variation in Nigeria’s BOP is not due to changes in exchange rate movements. The policy implication is that exchange rate depreciation which has been preponderant in Nigeria since the mid- 1980 s has not been very useful in promoting the country’s positive BOP. It is recommended that growth in the real sector should be improved to enhance exports, create employment, curb inflation and reduce poverty, while cutting non-productive imports, attracting foreign private investment and implementing well coordinated macroeconomic policies that impact inflation positively and stimulate exchange rate stability...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} {{was to investigate the}} proposition that current Microfinance solutions are not adequate for Microenterprises operating at the Base of the Pyramid. The research proposes Microfinance solutions for Microenterprises should provide all-inclusive solutions; encompassing both financial and business development services. While the government can lead the debate and deliver on some of the enabling requirements, the limited government resources cannot deliver fully on development requirements at the Base of the Pyramid. There is an increasing need for the private sector to participate in sustainable development initiatives. A key limiting factor is a lack of in-depth understanding of the needs of Microenterprises operating at the Base of the Pyramid. Quantitative research was conducted, using a survey-based method. The results show there is appetite amongst Microenterprise owners at the BOP for holistic Microfinance solutions that can deliver financial and business development services. The study also found business development services, focusing on developing business knowledge and business management skills, were <b>rated</b> the highest. <b>BOP</b> markets for Microenterprises are complex and require dedicated initiatives to understand them and deliver solutions tailored to their needs accordingly.

40|$|Objectives: To {{review the}} {{evidence}} for the efficacy of periodontal maintenance (PM) carried out in primary dental care (PDC) compared to the specialist setting for patients previously treated in a specialist setting for chronic (ChP) or aggressive (AgP) periodontitis. Methods: A focused PICO question and search protocol were developed. Online databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, WEB OF SCIENCE™ and COCHRANE LIBRARY were searched along with specialist journals in the subject area of periodontal research. Selection criteria included studies that investigated delivery of PM in both specialist and PDC settings for patients with ChP or AgP over a minimum 12 months. We looked for studies that reported changes in clinical attachment levels (CAL), tooth loss, pocket probing depths (PPDs) and bleeding on probing (BoP) as outcome measures. Results: Eight cohort studies were chosen for inclusion. There was considerable heterogeneity found between the eight studies, which did not allow for quantitative (meta) analysis and statistical testing of differences between groups. Clinical attachment levels remained relatively stable in patients who received specialist PM with mean changes of − 0. 42 mm to + 0. 2 mm, while for those enrolled in PDC-based PM for periods > 12 months, mean CAL losses were between − 0. 13 mm and − 2. 80 mm. PPD reduction for those subjects receiving specialist PM was between 0. 05 and 1. 8 mm for five studies but two cohorts experienced increases of 0. 32 and 0. 80 mm, respectively. Increases of up to 2. 90 mm (range: − 0. 1 to + 2. 90) and {{a higher proportion of}} deeper pockets were noted among PDC PM cohorts. Higher <b>rates</b> of <b>BoP</b> among those in receipt of PDC PM were reported in half of all studies. There were insufficient long-term data to make any firm conclusions about the effect of the delivery of PM on tooth loss. Conclusion: Within the limitations of the data available, it appears that specialist PM is effective in sustaining periodontal stability following active specialist intervention. There is limited evidence that PDC provides the same level of care; however, the limited comparative data available suggest that outcomes could be slightly worse in PDC...|$|R
