25|$|This road {{building}} programme {{continued into the}} start of the premiership of John Major. In the early-1990s, the government decided to complete the M3 motorway by building a six-lane <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> through Twyford Down. This attracted the first direct action protests against a major road in the country. Building work was delayed considerably, and anti-roads protesters gained large amounts of publicity. The Newbury bypass saw some of the largest protests against a road in the UK. Proposed originally in the 1980s, the bypass was subject to strong support and opposition. Also in this time frame, the M11 link road protest saw protracted disturbance during the upgrading of a section of the A12 through East London. Costs increased rapidly, the Newbury bypass being 50% over budget and many other schemes showed increases of 100%.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{concerns}} about undermining and vibrations causing subsidence of nearby buildings and compensating {{the thousands of}} people whose homes were destroyed during the digging of the tunnel construction began in March 1860. The line was mostly built using the [...] "cut-and-cover" [...] method from Paddington to King's Cross; east of there it continued <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] tunnel under Mount Pleasant, Clerkenwell then followed the culverted River Fleet beside Farringdon <b>Road</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> open <b>cutting</b> to near the new meat market at Smithfield.|$|R
50|$|This {{line was}} {{electrified}} in 1901. Thereafter, the Sydney Municipal Council set about widening the major routes into the city. The Sydney end of Parramatta <b>Road</b> (which lies <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting)</b> was widened and improved in 1910-1911. The 20th century {{also saw the}} advent of motorised traffic on the road.|$|R
50|$|The Low Level station {{opened in}} 1900 and closed in 1918. It was {{located on the}} west side of Highgate <b>Road</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> which passed under the Road and {{connected}} to the up MML and to the North London Line heading east.|$|E

50|$|The new {{methodology}} uses advanced modelling {{techniques to}} look at the diffusion of the impact of these factors over distance, taking into account the terrain of the land. For example, the tranquillity increases gradually the further one is from a busy road, but increases more sharply if the <b>road</b> is hidden <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting.</b>|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to earlier}} Maginot positions, the La Ferté site {{suffered}} {{from a number of}} design and construction deficiencies. The site contours around Block 2 required a great deal of rubble fill to cover the sides of the block. This rubble had not yet stabilized by the spring of 1940 and could be dislodged by artillery fire. Block 2 suffered from restricted fields of fire to the west and southwest, which were covered only by an automatic rifle cloche. The nearby <b>road</b> ran <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> that could not be swept by direct fire. Since La Ferté lacked mortars, the road was dead ground.|$|R
50|$|The main <b>road</b> <b>in</b> Lasnamäe is the 4- to 8-lane Laagna <b>Road,</b> {{which runs}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> east-west {{direction}} through {{the district and}} connects it at {{one end to the}} city centre, and at the other end to the Tallinn-Narva highway (E20) and Tallinn ring road (E265) at Väo. For most of its course the <b>road</b> is situated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> <b>in</b> the limestone plateau. This has earned the road its nickname - Lasnamäe Channel (Lasnamäe kanal) or simply The Channel.|$|R
25|$|East of Westbourne Park {{the line}} passes beneath the Great Western main line before {{resurfacing}} at Royal Oak station and running alongside {{the tracks of}} the main line to an island platform {{just north of the}} suburban platforms at Paddington station. The line enters a cut and cover tunnel {{at the end of the}} platforms and meets the District line and the other end of the Circle line from Bayswater at Praed Street Junction before passing through Edgware <b>Road</b> station <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting.</b> After King's Cross St Pancras station the line exits the tunnel before passing under the Ray Street Gridiron that carries the City Widened Lines which are currently used by Thameslink services. The line continues underground after Farringdon station; there are bay platforms at Moorgate station.|$|R
50|$|The new {{aqueduct}} {{was built}} under {{the provisions of}} The Wiltshire County Council (Semington Aqueduct) Scheme 2000, later confirmed on 17 July 2002, as Statutory Instrument No. 1868. It {{was part of a}} road-building scheme to provide a bypass for the villages of Semington, {{to the west of the}} new structure, and Berryfield to the north of the canal, ending on the southern edge of Melksham. In order to provide the necessary headroom of 18 ft, the <b>road</b> was built <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> at this point.|$|R
500|$|The East Coastway Line, {{a railway}} line {{currently}} operated by Southern, forms Round Hill's northern boundary. [...] London <b>Road</b> station, situated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> between London <b>Road</b> and Ditchling Road, serves the area. [...] Situated [...] from Brighton station, it opened on 1 October 1877 and retains its substantial ticket office building. The , 27-arch London <b>Road</b> viaduct (built <b>in</b> 1846) rises to [...] above the London Road valley immediately {{west of the}} station, separating the Round Hill suburb from neighbouring Preston. A [...] tunnel then takes the line under Ditchling Road.|$|R
50|$|A single {{platform}} {{station was}} {{provided with a}} brick station building facing the <b>road.</b> Situated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slight <b>cutting,</b> it was conveniently located to the town centre. It was also convenient for the Ebbw Vale Steelworks at Pont-y-Gof which were connected to the line by the Rassa Railroad. This connection was in use until 2 November 1959. Adjacent to the station building was a 46-lever signal box. The line continued north to a remotely situated goods yard and an untimetabled stop for miners at Beaufort. To the south, a road overbridge crossed the line. The single platform was subsequently doubled in size and the platform buildings rebuilt. The station boasted a staff of 44 in 1923 and 62 in 1937.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the steam}} railway line to Wedel was opened on 1 December 1883, also <b>a</b> station <b>in</b> the small village of Rissen was established. It was then {{also used for}} freight traffic and had 3 tracks, the third {{of which was a}} siding south of the two {{platform}} tracks, which was later removed. Electrification of the line to Wedel was completed on 20 May 1954. In May 1983 the new Rissen station opened next to the new Bundesstraße (federal <b>road)</b> 431 <b>in</b> <b>a</b> terrain <b>cutting</b> soon dubbed by the inhabitants as [...] "Rissen Canyon". The old station, a small building similar to the Sülldorf station, had to be demolished afterwards in order to complete the cutting with the new federal road.|$|R
5000|$|The A660 {{starts in}} Leeds city centre, officially at the {{junction}} of Woodhouse Lane and Claypit Lane. The northbound carriageway passes Leeds Metropolitan University's [...] "civic quarter" [...] campus, crosses the A58(M) (Leeds Inner Ring <b>Road),</b> which is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting,</b> and passes the University of Leeds with its landmark tower. The southbound carriageway is separated, at one stage by several terraced streets. The carriageways combine before crossing Woodhouse Moor to Hyde Park. The road passes the buildings of Leeds Girls' High School and climbs to Headingley, passing St Michael's Church and many shops and bars including the Arndale Centre. Shortly after the church, a plaque shows {{the site of the}} original oak tree which gave its name to the wapentake of Skyrack ("Shire oak"): this is reflected in two pub names and nearby Shire Oak Road. The road continues through Far Headingley and West Park.|$|R
500|$|The line is {{electrified}} with a four-rail DC system: {{a central}} conductor rail is energised at−210V and a rail outside the running rails at +420V, giving a potential difference of 630V. Much of the [...] double-track railway from the Hammersmith terminus to Westbourne Park station is on a [...] high brick viaduct. After Westbourne Park the line passes beneath the Great Western main line re-surfacing at Royal Oak station and running alongside the main lines to Paddington station. The line enters <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> {{just west of}} the station and a cut-and-cover tunnel {{at the end of the}} platforms. It meets the Circle line from Bayswater at Praed Street Junction before passing through Edgware <b>Road</b> station <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting.</b> After King's Cross St Pancras the line is in cutting, passing under the Ray Street Gridiron that carries the City Widened Lines used for Thameslink services. There are bay platforms at Moorgate. Just before Aldgate the line diverges from the Circle and Metropolitan lines to Aldgate East. The line passes over the London Overground at Whitechapel station continuing on the [...] former Whitechapel & Bow Railway to Bow Road where it surfaces, and then to Bromley-by-Bow, where it runs alongside the London, Tilbury and Southend line from Fenchurch Street. At the next station, West Ham, there is interchange with the Jubilee line, the Docklands Light Railway and c2c. There is a bay platform at the next station, Plaistow, and the line terminates after two more stations at Barking.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 1946, {{construction}} work {{began to turn}} the wartime RAF airfield into {{what became known as}} the Royal Aeronautical Establishment, Bedford. The runway was extended in the post-war period to accommodate the Bristol Brabazon aircraft, which required a very long runway but which never went into production. A lot of the development for what became the Harrier was done here, one early version became known as the 'Flying Bedstead'. Also Thurleigh had a catapult runway and it was here that the 'ski jump' later fitted to some aircraft carriers was also developed. One local <b>road</b> was put <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> for <b>a</b> runway to be put above it, linking the Airfield site to the wind-tunnel site about a mile and a half away, although ultimately this was never carried out. The runway is some 10,500 ft long, and some 300 ft wide and as of June 2011 is used by a number of car storage companies.|$|R

40|$|Raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides viverrinus Temminck) {{were used}} as a model species to study {{wildlife}} management and conservation issues in the countryside of Japan. Radio-tracking data were used to analyse habitat use, movements, home range configuration and stability, social aspects, and factors influencing raccoon dog behaviour. Comparisons were drawn with European badgers (Meles meles Linnaeus) in the UK in order to highlight aspects of movements and habitat use of omnivorous Carnivores. Two key issues concerning the conservation of raccoon dogs in Japan were investigated: road-kills and agricultural damage. The Japan Highway Public Corporation provided road-kill data on the National Expressways, and a questionnaire survey was conducted on agricultural damage to local governments, authorities of wildlife administration. Socio-cultural issues on wildlife conservation in Japan were critically reviewed and discussed. Two types of habitat users appeared {{to exist in the}} study area. One type of raccoon dogs ('mountain type') inhabited a more semi-natural environment, including secondary forest and herbaceous areas, whereas a second type ('village type') inhabited more managed environments, such as rice fields and cropland. The results suggested that habitat selection occurred at home-range and location scales and differed between the two types of raccoon dogs. The mean size of home range of the raccoon dogs was 111 ± 16. 9 ha (95 % kernel estimate) and 160 ± 34. 5 ha (95 % maximum convex polygon (MCP)). There {{was no significant difference in}} home-range size between age classes or sexes. Seasonal home ranges were larger in yearlings than adults, and largest in autumn; and there was no difference between sexes. Season affected nightly movements, i. e. mean inter-fix speed, mean 100 % MCP, and mean range span over the night; however, sex and age did not. All variables of nightly movement were smallest in winter. The mean fractal dimension of movements, i. e. degree of 'tortuousity' with self similarity, was 1. 226 and significantly differed from 1. 0 (a straight line) and 2. 0 (a Brownian random movement). The mountain type had significantly larger fractal dimension than the village type, possibly reflecting habitat complexity and/or heterogeneity. Badgers generally preferred pasture and avoided arable habitat, but showed some variability by year and at scales of selection. A Badger Removal Operation may have influenced habitat selection of the badgers. The mean size of home range of badgers was 56. 1 ± 7. 7 ha (95 % kernel estimates) and 56. 2 ± 7. 3 ha (95 % MCP). The mean fractal dimension of the badgers' movements was 1. 198 and was significantly different from 1. 0 and 2. 0. The raccoon dogs and the badgers showed similarities in movements, such as nightly home range, range span over night, and fractal dimension of movements. Sexual differences in spatial use existed in badgers but not in raccoon dogs. Road-kills of raccoon dogs appeared to be the highest, in percentage terms, of all wildlife species in Japan and this figure was linearly related to the traffic. Some road-features, such as whether the <b>road</b> was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>cutting</b> and its proximity to water, were positively associated with road-kills, while the presence of coniferous plantations as roadside habitat was dissociated with road-kills. Nationwide estimates of road-kills of raccoon dogs, based on available data for National Expressways only, were made with different assumptions. Conservative estimates put the number of road-kills at 110, 000 - 370, 000 per year. The potential for road-kill numbers to be used, after controlling for traffic data, as an index of population trends, is discussed. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> questionnaire survey of agricultural damage sent to 46 prefectures, all respondents (96 %) reported some damage by wildlife, and over 80 % of respondents reported macaque and boar damage, while nearly 70 % reported raccoon dog and deer damage. Sixty-nine agricultural products were reported to have been damaged by wildlife, and 41 of these by raccoon dogs. Maize and fruits were major crops damaged by raccoon dogs. Although about a half of respondents employed culling, its effectiveness is unclear. Although Japan seems far behind other developing countries in its approach to wildlife conservation issues, the situation could be substantially improved through increased scientific understanding and education. Radical changes may be also required in the legal status of wildlife and its management schemes. </p...|$|R
