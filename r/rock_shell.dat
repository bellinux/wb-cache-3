To obtain further information about collecting <b>rock</b> <b>shells,</b> we investigated the effects of environmental hormones on <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> collected from the kumamoto and Fukuoka coastal waters. The <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> with imposex were still found in Kumamoto coastal waters, even though the number of <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> with imposex showed {{a tendency to be}} decreased.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported that the}} practice using <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> is useful for environmental education. In this practice, the precise distinction of the sex of <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> is very important. However, our preceding study demonstrated {{that there are many}} <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> that are difficult to determine the sex. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to obtain information about a suitable period for collection of female <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> inhabiting in Kumamoto harbor, by examining the maturity of their ovary. As a result, the maturity of the ovary in female <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> was observed during periods from beginning of June to the end of August. In addition, since imposex in female <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> inhabiting in the Kumamoto coastal waters was not found, it is likely that the contamination of organotin compounds is improved...|$|R

Thus, in the present study, to find the suitable points for collection of the <b>rock</b> <b>shells,</b> we investigated the sexual abnormalities of the <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> inhabiting in Kumamoto harbor. The imposex-exhibiting <b>rock</b> <b>shells</b> were found in 9 of 17 harbors investigated.

5000|$|The white <b>rock</b> <b>shell</b> is a predator, cannibal and scavenger. [...] It {{uses its}} radula to {{bore a hole}} in the shell of a {{barnacle}} or mollusc and then sucks out the contents. Prey species include the sea snails Lunella torquata, Cronia avellana and Pyrene bidentata, and the mussel Septifer bilocularis. As the tide rises, the white <b>rock</b> <b>shell</b> makes foraging expeditions up the beach, travelling far away from the sheltered niches to which it retreats at low tide. This is in contrast to the mulberry whelk Morula marginalba which shares the same habitat but remains in an area where there are both crevices in which to hide and prey species on which to feed.|$|E
50|$|Dicathais is a genus of predatory sea snails, marine {{gastropod}} molluscs {{in the family}} Muricidae, the rock snails. This genus is monotypic; the only species in it is Dicathais orbita, common name the white <b>rock</b> <b>shell</b> or cart-rut shell, found round the coasts of Australia and New Zealand.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Rock</b> <b>Shell</b> Chamberlain Dord (1-48) is {{the captain}} of Dezzle's Bodyguards, a squat {{creature}} whose head resembles an ammonite fossil. Dord looked after Dezzle's head after he was blown to pieces, and remained as his loyal servant, until Dezzle returned in his new form. Dord was killed alongside Dezzle by B-Fighter Kabuto with the Input Rifle after his shell was impaled by Kabuto's lance.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{believed}} that the only inducer of imposex was tributyltin (TBT), which can be active in extremely low concentrations, but recent studies reported other substances as inducers, such as triphenyltin and ethanol. [...] Tributyltin is an anti-fouling agent for boats which affects females of the species Nucella lapillus (dog whelk), Voluta ebraea (the Hebrew volute), Olivancillaria vesica, Stramonita haemastoma (red-mouthed <b>rock</b> <b>shell)</b> and more than 200 other marine gastropods.|$|E
50|$|The giant Caribbean {{sea anemone}} is usually {{found in the}} crevices of rock walls, {{attached}} to a <b>rock,</b> <b>shell,</b> or almost any other hard object in shallow water that experiences full-strength seawater most of the time, {{which may explain why}} the species is so common in Bermuda. Giant Caribbean sea anemones are also very common around reefs in both “forereef” and lagoon areas. It can also be found at most inshore areas, on coral reefs, though this is less common. Sea anemones in general can be found anywhere from the intertidal zone all the way to a depth of 30,000 feet.|$|E
50|$|Pleurodictyum is an extinct genus of {{tabulate}} corals, {{characterized by}} polygonal corallites. Colonies commonly encrust hard substrates such as <b>rocks,</b> <b>shells</b> and carbonate hardgrounds.|$|R
5000|$|The word 'Rococo' {{is derived}} from the French [...] "rocaille", a word used to {{describe}} the <b>rock</b> and <b>shell</b> work of the Versailles grottoes. Many pieces of carved furniture dating from the 18th century—in particular, mirror frames—depict <b>rocks,</b> <b>shells,</b> and dripping water in their composition, frequently in association with Chinese figures and pagodas.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a common}} species over its range. Colonies are usually found {{attached}} to hard substrates such as <b>rock,</b> <b>shells</b> and even encrusting sponges on vertical walls.|$|R
50|$|The white <b>rock</b> <b>shell</b> {{is large}} {{with a strong}} shell usually about 6 cm long, but {{occasionally}} growing to twice this size. It shows great variation in its shell sculpture across its range. In Eastern Australia there are 7 to 9 deeply indented ribs in each whorl with clefts of a similar width between them, sculptured with further fine riblets. This gives a fluted edge to the lip and the grooves {{can also be seen}} on the interior surface of the shell. The central column or columella is smooth and the interior of the shell is white.|$|E
5000|$|Neosabellaria cementarium {{lives in}} a tube which it creates by {{cementing}} together grains of sand. This is attached along its length to a <b>rock,</b> <b>shell</b> or other hard substrate. At first it is short but it is widened and extended as the worm grows, sometimes reaching a length of more than 7 cm [...] and a diameter of 4 mm. The worm is largely hidden within the tube {{but it has a}} yellow or golden-coloured operculum and a number of fine tentacles which it extends in order to feed. Sometimes the tubes are solitary and sometimes they are grouped together but this species does not form reefs.|$|E
50|$|The sexes are {{separate}} {{in the white}} <b>rock</b> <b>shell.</b> The eggs that develop in the female gonoduct are wrapped {{in a number of}} membranes to form an egg capsule. Several of these are joined together in an egg mass and attached to the substrate. Different precursors of the pigment Tyrian purple have been found in the male and female gonoducts and in the egg capsule. Early development of the larvae takes place inside the capsule which contains yolk granules on which they feed. When they have developed to the veliger stage, the larvae emerge from the capsule and become planktonic. After drifting with the currents for a while, these settle on the seabed, undergo metamorphosis and become juvenile snails.|$|E
50|$|Aulopora is an extinct genus of {{tabulate}} coral {{characterized by}} a bifurcated budding pattern and conical corallites. Colonies commonly encrust hard substrates such as <b>rocks,</b> <b>shells</b> and carbonate hardgrounds.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} common on <b>rocks,</b> <b>shells,</b> and pilings in {{protected}} bays, {{but it also}} lives in sheltered places on the open coast, occurring from the low intertidal zone to subtidal waters.|$|R
50|$|Rapana venosa, {{common name}} the {{veined rapa whelk}} or Asian rapa whelk, is a species of large predatory sea snail, a marine {{gastropod}} mollusk or whelk, in the family Muricidae, the <b>rock</b> <b>shells.</b>|$|R
