It can also issue guidelines for ensuring the security of the services of the teachers or other employees of the institution. In another landmark judgement delivered on 31 October 2002, the Supreme Court ruled that in case of aided minority institutions offering professional courses, admission could be only through a common entrance test conducted by State or a university.

However, much if not most of the distributed mercury depositional input is from natural sources. [...] Pre-Anthropocene tissue-bound levels in fish may not have differed markedly from current levels, bringing into question whether economically and environmentally expensive political <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> would be ineffectual and moot.

2500|$|Certain <b>regulatory</b> <b>measures</b> are {{in place}} to {{minimize}} RBC storage lesion – including a maximum shelf life (currently 42 days), a maximum auto-hemolysis threshold (currently 1% in the US, 0.8% in Europe), and a minimum level of post-transfusion RBC survival in vivo (currently 75% after 24 hours). However, all of these criteria are applied in a universal manner that {{does not account for}} differences among units of product. For example, testing for the post-transfusion RBC survival in vivo is done on a sample of healthy volunteers, and then compliance is presumed for all RBC units based on universal (GMP) processing standards (of course, RBC survival by itself does not guarantee efficacy, but it is a necessary prerequisite for cell function, and hence serves as a regulatory proxy). Opinions vary as to the [...] "best" [...] way to determine transfusion efficacy in a patient in vivo. In general, there are not yet any in vitro tests to assess quality or predict efficacy for specific units of RBC blood product prior to their transfusion, though there is exploration of potentially relevant tests based on RBC membrane properties such as erythrocyte deformability and erythrocyte fragility (mechanical).|$|E

30|$|In short, as a {{first step}} {{identification}} as SVHC according to Article 57 of the REACH regulation needs to be considered. Such substances become included in the REACH candidate list. Article 57 of the REACH Regulation allows to include substances on the candidate list that (i) are classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR) category 1 A or 1 B, (ii) have persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) or (iii) very persistent and very bioaccumulative (vPvB) properties according to REACH (Annex XIII), or (iv) have an equivalent level of concern as CMR or PBT/vPvB substances. The inclusion of a substance in the candidate list results in obligations for the manufacturer to provide information to downstream users and to consumers (if >  0.1 % proportion in articles). This <b>regulatory</b> <b>measure</b> alone is not sufficient to control the emissions of short-chain PFASs. But the inclusion into the candidate list is a strong signal itself since it contains all substances of very high concern identified within the EU. For substances on the candidate list REACH foresees authorisation as the <b>regulatory</b> <b>measure.</b> In such case, using the substance is only allowed if authorization was granted. However, an authorisation does apply only for the substance itself and does not include any precursor substances. Furthermore, the authorisation procedure does not include imported articles, probably contributing to the emissions of short-chain PFASs in Europe. Consequently, starting the authorisation procedure would not constitute an effective risk management option. A restriction (Article 67) can cover the placing of a substance on the market, the content of a substance in (imported) articles, the use of such a substance on its own or in a mixture and respective precursors. Thus, a general restriction can address all relevant emission routes and is considered the appropriate <b>regulatory</b> <b>measure</b> for short-chain PFASs under REACH. To decide if certain exemptions might be appropriate, further detailed information on uses and alternatives are necessary. Once in force, the restriction is valid for the European Economic Area (EEA), having a population of more than 500 million people.|$|R

This risk is curbing small exporters and resulting in a concentration of Chinese exports from big and more productive exporters...|$|R

30|$|A {{regulation}} {{of every single}} precursor is impracticable due to the unknown but likely vast amount of precursors on the market. For an effective <b>regulatory</b> <b>measure,</b> it is mandatory to address both PFAAs and their precursor substances, considering also emissions from imported articles. These considerations have already been outlined by Vierke et al. [39] regarding the long-chain perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acid PFOA. Precursors registered under REACH are mainly used for manufacturing polymers according to industry. Those polymers (i.e., side-chain fluorinated polymers) contain unbound residues of PFASs precursors or the polymers may breakdown over time and release PFAS precursors [8]. Thus, polymers are included in such a regulation as well.|$|R
