[...] "It owns {{a team of}} horses, cart, horse-hoe, plough, <b>ridger,</b> harrow, Cambridge roller, marker; and hires other implements as required; it insures, buys, and sells co-operatively. This year (for patriotic reasons) wheat and potatoes form the chief crop, with sufficient oats, barley, beans and mangolds to feed the horses and the pigs, {{of which there are}} many. The society last year marketed more fat pigs {{than the rest of the}} village and adjoining farms put together.|$|E
60|$|When {{the rain}} was over, we filled our buckets with potatoes, and went along the wet furrows, {{sticking}} the spritted tubers in the cold ground. Being sandy, the field dried quickly. About twelve o'clock, when nearly all the potatoes were set, he left me, and fetching up Bob from the far hedge-side, harnessed the mare and him to the <b>ridger,</b> to cover the potatoes. The sharp light plough turned the soil in a fine furrow over the potatoes; hosts of little birds fluttered, settled, bounded off again after the plough. He called to the horses, and they came downhill, the white stars on the two brown noses nodding up and down, George striding firm and heavy behind. They came down upon me; at a call the horses turned, shifting awkwardly sideways; he flung himself against the plough, and leaning well in, brought it round with a sweep: a click, and they are off uphill again. There is a great rustle as the birds sweep round after him and follow up the new turned furrow. Untackling the horses when the rows were all covered, we tramped behind them down the wet hillside to dinner.|$|E

'The public {{dinner to}} our {{distinguished}} fellow-colonist and townsman, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, Port Middlebay District Magistrate, came off {{yesterday in the}} large room of the Hotel, which was crowded to suffocation. It is estimated that not fewer than forty-seven persons must have been accommodated with dinner at one time, exclusive of the company in the passage and on the stairs. The beauty, fashion, and exclusiveness of Port Middlebay, flocked to do honour to one so deservedly esteemed, so highly talented, and so widely popular. Doctor Mell (of Colonial Salem-House Grammar School, Port Middlebay) presided, and on his right sat the distinguished guest. After {{the removal of the}} cloth, and the singing of Non Nobis (beautifully executed, and in which we were at no loss to distinguish the bell-like notes of that gifted amateur, WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, JUNIOR), the usual loyal and patriotic toasts were severally given and rapturously received. Doctor Mell, in a speech replete with feeling, then proposed [...] "Our distinguished Guest, the ornament of our town. May he never leave us but to better himself, and may his success among us be such as to render his bettering himself impossible!" [...] The cheering with which the toast was received defies description. Again and again it rose and fell, like the waves of ocean. At length all was hushed, and WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, presented himself to return thanks. Far be it from us, in the present comparatively imperfect state of the resources of our establishment, to endeavour to follow our distinguished townsman through the smoothly-flowing periods of his polished and highly-ornate address! Suffice it to observe, that it was a masterpiece of eloquence; and that those passages in which he more particularly traced his own successful career to its source, and warned the younger portion of his auditory from the shoals of ever incurring pecuniary liabilities which they were unable to liquidate, brought a tear into the manliest eye present. The remaining toasts were DOCTOR MELL; Mrs. MICAWBER (who gracefully bowed her acknowledgements from the side-door, where a galaxy of beauty was elevated on chairs, at once to witness and adorn the gratifying scene), Mrs. <b>RIDGER</b> BEGS (late Miss Micawber); Mrs. MELL; WILKINS MICAWBER, ESQUIRE, JUNIOR (who convulsed the assembly by humorously remarking that he found himself unable to return thanks in a speech, but would do so, with their permission, in a song); Mrs. MICAWBER'S FAMILY (well known, it is needless to remark, in the mother-country), &c. &c. &c. At the conclusion of the proceedings the tables were cleared as if by art-magic for dancing. Among the votaries of TERPSICHORE, who disported themselves until Sol gave warning for departure, Wilkins Micawber, Esquire, Junior, and the lovely and accomplished Miss Helena, fourth daughter of Doctor Mell, were particularly remarkable.' ...|$|E

Jack Davis became Glen Ridge's first All-American at Glen Ridge and owns the career saves record there. Davis also earned a Division 1 scholarship to Georgetown. With these players among other talented individuals, Glen Ridge became a team that could surprise people despite being a very young program. That showed in the Essex County tournament semi-finals against cross-town foe Montclair. Montclair is a Group 4 school known for its history and winning tradition; they were also the favorites to win the County Tournament. Glen Ridge would create some of their own history by defeating the Mounties and creating some buzz around the state.|$|E

40|$|The {{main feature}} of the boar’s head used to root around for food is the front part, {{which is similar to}} the <b>ridger</b> in terms of function, load, and environment. In this paper, the boar’s head was {{selected}} as the biological prototype for developing a new <b>ridger.</b> The point cloud of the head was captured by a 3 D scanner, and then, the head surface was reconstructed using 3 D coordinates. The characteristic curves of the front part of the boar’s head were extracted, and then, five cross-sectional curves and one vertical section curve were fitted. Based on the fitted curves, five kinds of bionic ridgers were designed. The penetrating resistances of the bionic ridgers and traditional <b>ridger</b> were tested at different speeds in an indoor soil bin. The test results showed that bionic <b>ridger</b> B had the best penetrating resistance reduction ratio of 16. 67 % at 4. 2 [*]km/h velocity. In order to further evaluate the performance of the best bionic <b>ridger</b> (bionic <b>ridger</b> B), both the bionic <b>ridger</b> and traditional <b>ridger</b> were tested in a field under the same working conditions. The field results indicate that the bionic <b>ridger</b> reduces penetrating resistance by 6. 91 % compared to the traditional <b>ridger,</b> and the test results validate that the bionic <b>ridger</b> has an effect on reducing penetrating resistance...|$|E
