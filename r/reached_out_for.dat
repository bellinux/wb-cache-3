500|$|After {{five years}} of {{substance}} abuse, arrests, rehab, and relapse, Downey was finally ready to work toward a full recovery from drugs {{and a return to}} his career. In discussing his failed attempts to control his own addictive behavior in the past, Downey told Oprah Winfrey in November 2004 that [...] "when someone says, 'I really wonder if maybe I should go to rehab?' Well, uh, you're a wreck, you just lost your job, and your wife left you. Uh, you might want to give it a shot." [...] He added that after his last arrest in April 2001, when he knew he would likely be facing another stint in prison or another form of incarceration such as court-ordered rehab, [...] "I said, 'You know what? I don't think I can continue doing this.' And I <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> help, and I ran with it. You can reach out for help in kind of a half-assed way and you'll get it and you won't take advantage of it. It's not that difficult to overcome these seemingly ghastly problems...what's hard is to decide to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Mora death raised {{fears that}} the country's economy would be hurt by reduced tourism, leading Univision to {{describe}} the situation as [...] "an internal crisis". [...] Commentary published by the Costa Rican Times alleged that the true culprits would never be found, saying whoever was blamed would be a scapegoat offered up by the drug traffickers. [...] The government [...] "is happy letting the Caribbean side of Costa Rica lose all tourism" [...] continued the commentary by Dan Stevens. [...] "Maybe the group Sea Turtle Conservation with Guns should be formed to fight back." [...] An editorial published by the Tico Times asked why it took a murder to get the government to act. [...] "Mora <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> help before he was killed, and no one came to the rescue, no matter what political spin is put on it", said the author. [...] Mora's death, suggested the author, shows that [...] "the drug traffickers are winning", that crime {{is out of control}} in Limón, and that [...] "the bad guys operate with near impunity." [...] The editorial concluded by imploring Costa Ricans to re-evaluate their personal environmental habits and support environmental groups that keep fighting. [...] The Guápiles Biofestival, an arts festival held each year during early June, was also dedicated to Mora.|$|E

[...] He tried to admit himself to the Buffalo Psychiatric Center in September 1980. The Psychiatric Center staff {{told him he was}} not a danger to himself or others and so could not be admitted. This was a common practice at a time when such centers were being downsized. Instead, the center officials recommended counseling therapy. Fourteen days after he left the center, the killings began.|$|E

2500|$|Bashir II, who {{had come}} to power through local {{politics}} and nearly fallen from power because of his increasing detachment from them, <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> allies, allies who looked on the entire area as [...] "the Orient" [...] and who could provide trade, weapons and money, without requiring fealty and without, it seemed, being drawn into endless internal squabbles. He disarmed the Druze and allied with France, governing {{in the name of the}} Egyptian Pasha Muhammad Ali, who entered Lebanon and formally took overlordship in 1832. For the remaining 8 years, the sectarian and feudal rifts of the 1821–1825 conflict were heightened by the increasing economic isolation of the Druze, and the increasing wealth of the Maronites.|$|E
2500|$|This view is {{supported}} by German historian Johannes Burkhardt, who writes that Gustavus entered the 30 Years War exactly 100 years {{after the publication of}} the Confessio Augustana, the core confession of faith of the Lutheran Church, and let himself be praised as its saviour. Yet Gustavus' own [...] "manifesto of war" [...] does not mention any religious motivations at all but speaks of political and economical reasons. Sweden would have to maintain its integrity in the face of several provocations and aggressions by the Habsburgian Empire. The manifesto was written by scholar Johann Adler Salvius in a style common of the time that promotes a [...] "just war". Burkhardt argues that traditional Swedish historiography constructed a defensive interest in security out of that by taking the manifesto's text for granted. But to defend Stockholm, the occupation of the German Baltic territories would have been an extreme advance and the imperial Baltic Sea fleet mentioned as a threat in the manifesto had never reached {{more than a quarter of}} the size of the Swedish fleet. Moreover, it was never maintained to challenge Sweden but to face the separatist Netherlands. So if ruling the Baltic Sea was a goal of Swedish strategy, the conquests in Germany were not a defensive war but an act of expansion. From Swedish Finland, Gustavus advanced along the Baltic Sea coast and eventually to Augsburg and Munich and he even urged the Swiss Confederacy to join him. This was no longer about Baltic interests but the imperial capital of Vienna and the alpine passes that were now in close reach of the Swedish army. Burkhardt points out that the Gothic legacy of the Swedes, coalesced as a political program. The Swedish king was also [...] "Rex Gotorum" [...] (...) , and the list of kings was traced back to the Gothic rulers to construct continuity. Prior to his embarkment to northern Germany, Gustavus urged the Swedish nobility to follow the example of conquests set by their Gothic ancestors. Had he lived longer, it would have been likely that Gustavus had <b>reached</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> the imperial crown of the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
