Many of the 'hells' are of tourist interest only and cannot be used as onsen (notably the Blood Pond Hell (reddish water) and the Oniyama Hell). The city's ryokans and public onsen are amply supplied by the same volcanic source. When Chiba University and Tokyo's Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies compiled a list of prefectures meeting demands for reusable energy, Oita ranked number one with a 25.2% <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> through the use of geothermal energy and hot spring heat.

40|$|This article {{compares the}} <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> of {{selected}} types of meat (beef, pork, and poultry) in the Visegrad countries. The data are obtained from Eurostat and from {{national statistical offices}} of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland and Hungary. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> is evaluated for the time period 2003 - 2013 and its results are compared to trade coverage ratio that indicates competitiveness of country in given commodity. Degree of self-sufficiency is an important indicator of country's ability to meet demand of domestic supply. From the obtained results, it can be concluded, that {{the situation in the}} Czech Republic with regard to self-sufficiency significantly deteriorated after EU accession, especially in the area of pork and poultry. The self-sufficiency for pork meat decreased to 57 % and to 73 % in the case of poultry. The situation is quite stable for beef. However beef creates {{only a small portion of}} the Czech consumption. A similar situation can be observed in Slovakia, its degree of self-sufficiency of pork and poultry declined down to 53 % and 78 % respectively. To cover production of poultry and pork from national resources in both countries, production would need to increase by millions of swine and chicken, which may be complicated with respect to existing infrastructure. The production of beef, poultry and pork is sufficient in Poland, production covers consumption. Self-sufficiency in beef increased above 400 % mainly due to decline in beef consumption. Since 2009, self-sufficiency in pork has slightly risen and in 2013 it reached 117 %. Consumption and production of poultry is on the rise, poultry become a substitute to beef; processing industry doubled its output between 2003 and 2013. Also Hungary, similarly to Poland, is able to cover domestic consumption by domestic production. The self-sufficiency in the case of poultry meat reach 170 %, which is positively reflected in the trade balance. Between 2003 and 2013, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> in pork meat fluctuates between 105 and 120 %. The trade balance in beef is balanced and correlated with the degree of self-sufficiency moving slightly above 100 %...|$|E

40|$|The {{relevance}} {{of this work}} is determined, on the one hand, by tightening of the foreign political situation and its possible {{negative impact on the}} food security of the country, and, on the other hand, by the crisis of the domestic agricultural sector. These factors demand the development of new approaches to regional agroindustrial complex (AIC) management. The aim is to develop a methodology for assessing the level <b>of</b> food <b>self-sufficiency</b> in main food areas of the Volgograd region. The author used the results of the statistical materials of AIC of the Volgograd region for 2016. The analytical methods included mathematical analysis and comparison. The main results are as follows. Based on the analysis of the current situation to ensure food security of Russia it was proved that at the present time it is necessary to develop effective indicators showing the level <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> in basic food regions. It was also revealed that at the moment this indicator in the system of regional agrarian and industrial complex is not controlled. As a result of generalization of existing approaches the author’s method <b>of</b> <b>rating</b> the level <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> <b>of</b> regions was offered. Its testing was carried out in several districts of the Volgograd region. The proposed authoring method <b>of</b> <b>rating</b> estimation <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> in basic foodstuffs can be used in the regional agroindustrial complex management system at the federal and local levels. It can be used to rank areas in terms <b>of</b> their <b>self-sufficiency</b> in basic foodstuffs. This allows us to focus on the development of backward areas of agro-food and make appropriate management decisions. The final rating value - 0. 759 obtained by the results of analysis of the situation in the Volgograd region means that the situation in matters of selfsufficiency in basic foodstuffs in general is good. However, we should aim at the maximum possible value <b>of</b> the <b>rating</b> - 1. In the application of the proposed methodology for the assessment of the situation in various regions of the country it is possible to compare and evaluate the situation with the development of appropriate management decisions...|$|R

40|$|The plant {{quarantine}} measures for tulip and lily bulbs were abolished in 1988. A {{removal of the}} quarantine made Japanese bulb growers face international competition in the markets. Since then the imports of bulbs, mainly from Holland, increased rapidly and bulb prices tended to decline gradually, while the Japanese production of bulbs did not decrease. The imports also introduced new varieties of bulbs to Japan. The demand for tulip bulbs increased greatly until the late 1990 s, but in the 2000 s the Japanese bulb markets stagnated. Bulb prices decreased, and the domestic production of bulbs decreased sharply, which caused a great {{reduction in the number}} of bulb farmers. Consequently, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> for producing tulip bulbs in Japan decreased from 80 % in 1988 to 20 % in 2006, even though the volume of imported bulbs decreased in the 2000 s. This paper analyzes the demand and supply conditions of tulip bulbs, and reports estimates of the Japanese demand and supply functions of tulip bulbs by regression analysis. Demand depends upon the real price (in terms of consumption goods) of tulip bulbs negatively and the real national income positively, and shows that the demand curve shifted forward until 2001, and then shifted backwards. Domestic supply depends upon the prices of tulip bulbs and the rice prices positively...|$|E

For this aim I {{developed}} a Supply-Demand Model of Rice which consists of eight structural equations used and estimated the time series data from 1970 to 1998 and eight definition formulas. In order to conduct simulations, I think two factor, the change of political sector variables such as the government intervention price (purchasing or offering price) or quantity and market opening variables such as the amount of the Minimum Market Access or the Tariffication. From the simulation, it is clear that the continual raising of the government-purchasing price is a necessary condition in order to achieve self-sufficiency. And the key of decision is amount of the stock when is faced to the choice problem of the special treatment or the tariffication. The notable simulation results are as follows: (1) Self-sufficiency is achieved by raising a government-purchasing price. (2) However this political process result in increasing the stock. The problem of the surplus stock becomes more serious when the government chooses the continuation of special treatment so that the Minimum Market Access is expanded. In the worst case, the amount of stock reaches up to 72. 4 % of domestic consumption. (3) When accepting tariffication, the problem of the stock surplus is mitigated. The amount of stock becomes 15 % of the domestic consumption. (4) When accepting tariffication, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> comes down to 77. 4 %.

40|$|Improving feed {{efficiency}} in dairy cattle {{could result in}} more profitable and environmentally sustainable dairy production through lowering feed costs and emissions from dairy farming. In addition, beef production based on dairy herds generates fewer greenhouse gas emissions per unit of meat output than beef production from suckler cow systems. Different scenarios {{were used to assess}} the profitability of adding traits, excluded from the current selection index for Finnish Ayrshire, to the breeding goal for combined dairy and beef production systems. The additional breeding goal traits were growth traits (average daily gain of animals in the fattening and rearing periods), carcass traits (fat covering, fleshiness and dressing percentage), mature live weight (LW) of cows and residual feed intake (RFI) traits. A breeding scheme was modeled for Finnish Ayrshire under the current market situation in Finland using the deterministic simulation software ZPLAN+. With the economic values derived for the current production system, the inclusion of growth and carcass traits, while preventing LW increase generated the highest improvement in the discounted profit of the breeding program (3. 7 %), followed by the scenario where all additional traits were included simultaneously (5. 1 %). The use of a selection index that included growth and carcass traits excluding LW, increased the profit (0. 8 %), but reduced the benefits resulted from breeding for beef traits together with LW. A moderate decrease in the profit of the breeding program was obtained when adding only LW to the breeding goal (- 3. 1 %), whereas, adding only RFI traits to the breeding goal resulted in a minor increase in the profit (1. 4 %). Including beef traits with LW in the breeding goal showed to be the most potential option to improve the profitability of the combined dairy and beef production systems and would also enable a higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> in beef. When considering {{feed efficiency}} related traits, the inclusion of LW traits in the breeding goal that includes growth and carcass traits could be more profitable than the inclusion of RFI, because the marginal costs of measuring LW can be expected to be lower than for RFI and it is readily available for selection. In addition, before RFI can be implemented as a breeding objective, the genetic correlations between RFI and other breeding goal traits estimated for the studied population as well as information on the most suitable indicator traits for RFI are needed to assess more carefully the consequences of selecting for RFI...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is focused}} on the adaptation process in a certain Retirement home in Strakonice. The old age is the last evolution period of one´s life and the society should do its best to enable the people to spend this time in harmony, with sense of peace and joy. Nowadays, a pensioner is forced to think of the options provided by social services/social care in case that the health status doesn´t allow him to take care of himself sufficiently and independently or is not able to assure such care through his family. Then a long stay service in a retirement home seems to be an appropriate possibility. Joining such facility is usually considered {{as one of the most}} difficult situations that a retiree can meet with. It brings various risks as environment change with no knowledge of the area or people; it represents the loss or limitation of one´s autonomy, habits and privacy etc. A pensioner should properly consider this situation with his family, get ready for it and voluntarily decide to join an retirement home. The objective of my dissertation is to analyse the factors that influence the adaptation of retired people in the Retirement Home Rybniční, Strakonice. In the empirical part, there has been used the method of qualitative research and technics of demi structured dialogue for data collection. The research file has been chosen by the method of contingent defined selection. The own survey has been performed on a selected sample of retirees who complied with the given contingent conditions. The research showed that the arrival to the home for the elderly people is subject to poor health and inadequate housing situation, which represents a barrier to the environment for seniors. To answer the main research questions: What factors affect the adaptation process in the Retirement Home Rybniční, Strakonice? I can state, that the factors such as the home, the saturation of the needs, social contacts with family, friends and other users and active leisure more or less influence the seniors. The research results also pointed out the importance of self-sufficiency, which is affected by the health condition on one hand. On the other hand seniors are driven not only by the mission of Retirement Home Rybniční, but also by their own initiative to maintain the greatest possible degree of autonomy and self-sufficiency. The health status and the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> have a great impact on the process of adaptation and affect the individual factors of adaptation. This work should highlight the importance of the adaptation process of the seniors in the home for the elderly, which is not possible to underestimate. Furthermore, it should highlight the need for cooperation of the staff with the family, the importance of communication, environment, needs saturation and activities that can help to overcome this tough life step. Findings and conclusions of the thesis will be used as a feedback for the institution, where the research was carried out...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Model housing like {{a part of}} {{self-contained}} {{rehabilitation of}} children with combinated handicap In my thesis I deal with the following subject: Model housing like a part of self-contained rehabilitation of children with combinated handicap. The model housing is totally new project which Children´s Centre ARPIDA in České Budějovice (hereinafter DC ARPIDA ") took up {{as part of its}} services. The project has been running for two years and its implementation is realized in the second grade of vocational tranining school of DC ARPIDA in the building of The model protected housing. The aim of the project is to teach children with physical and combined handicap predefined activities. These predefined model activities should enlarge their independence from other persons and increase the extent of their self-sufficiency in common and extended daily activities connected with housing. The model protected housing is designed for children who attend the two-year vocational tranining school in DC ARPIDA where they go through three month´s course of the model protected housing. At the beginning of the course the children go through ergo-therapeutical examination to determine the rate of their independence and self-sufficiency. After finishing the course they are reviewed to find out whether they have improved their results and how they have profited from passing through the course. The main goal of my thesis is to investigate whether The model protected housing contributes to the increasing of the client´s level of seff-sufficiency and why it has a great importance in the system of education and physiotherapy. Another goal which should be followed is to show how the children´s parents see the project as a whole, whether they want their children to take part in this project, if they support the idea of a separate living and how they want their children to live in the future. I used the questionnaire method and the secondary data analysis to verify the given hypotheses. The interviewed group was made up of the parents of children clients of DC ARPIDA. My main aim was to investigate how much they are informed about the possibilities of integration of their children to the society, in what ways the parents are able to support them, their willingness to assist in this proccess and what is their idea of their children´s future life. The proccess of integration is not only the result of school classes or experts´ and school staff´s effort but first of all it is the parents who are supposed {{to be the most important}} link in the proccess of integration. Their position in the proccess of successful integration is irreplaceable. The input and output physiotherapy results were used for the secondary analysis. On the basis of data obtained from this analysis it is possible to claim that the model activities which the children performed in the model protected housing help to increase the rate of independance from an other person and of everyday self-sufficiency. With respect to explicit results of the research it is possible to draw the conclusion that in all cases the course of model protected housing increases the function <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>self-sufficiency</b> and independence from the others in the model activities. Thereby the basis hypothesis has been clearly confirmed...|$|E

40|$|In May 2000, Japan {{reformed}} {{a subsidy}} system for dairy fanners {{which was established}} in 1965. In this system, raw milk prices had been artificially maintained to protect dairy farmers, and assure the stable supply of raw milk. The aim {{of this paper is}} to examine what effect this reform has on raw milk market and the joint sales organization which the Designated Associations (cooperatives of raw milk produsers) or "Shiteidantai" control. The results are as follows: 1) The reform of Dairy and Dairy Industry Policy has an impact on raw milk and dairy products market. In particular, Japanese dairy farmers are facing business difficulties (demand and supply imbalances, depressed prices). In opposition to that situation, the Designated Associations voluntarily have launched a campaign to reconstruct the joint sales organization, and display milk control function. The time has come for Japan to construct the Designated Cooperative nation-wide, in order to boost efficiency of the joint sales organization. 2) In Japan, about 60 % of production is used to produce milk for drinking, while the remaining 40 % of raw milk is processed into other dairy products such as butter, skim milk powder, and cheese. However, the demand of butter and skim milk powder shows a decrease. The Designated Associations diversified utilization of raw milk, in order to prevent market surpluses and consequent market and price instability. At present, there are new classifications of processed milk available on the market: cream, condensed skim milk, and condensed milk. Consequently, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> domestic <b>self-sufficiency</b> in dairy products would remain high, following an increase in demand for raw milk...|$|R
