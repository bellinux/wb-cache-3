25|$|CARICOM was {{instrumental}} {{in the formation of the}} Association of Caribbean States (ACS) on 24 July 1994. The original idea for the Association came from a recommendation of the West Indian Commission, established in 1989 by the CARICOM heads of state and government.

The CTM not only refused to endorse the new party but also expelled Lombardo Toledano, his supporters on the CTM's board, and other left-wing unionists. The leadership of the CTM also adjusted its foreign policy to conform to that of President Miguel Alemán and withdrew from both the Confederación de Trabajadores de América Latina (a <b>regional</b> <b>organization</b> founded by Lombardo Toledano) and the pro-Soviet World Federation of Trade Unions. The CTM subsequently affiliated with the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, which later became the International Trade Union Confederation.|$|E

A week after Johnson took office, the United States and 11 other nations signed the North Atlantic Treaty, creating a <b>regional</b> <b>organization</b> that became the heart of a comprehensive collective security system. After initial reservations, Johnson supported the new alliance and the program of military assistance for NATO and other U.S. allies instituted by the Mutual Defense Assistance Act (1949).|$|E

40|$|The core {{argument}} {{of this article}} is to advocate the recognition of <b>regional</b> <b>organizations</b> as international actors. Conceptions of the European Union (EU) as an international actor are not new. However, a great deal of the literature regards the EU as sui generis in nature and lacking in external capabilities when compared to nation-states. Other <b>regional</b> <b>organizations,</b> such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) fare even worse. This article notes that we need to move beyond a state-centric view of world politics to assess the actor capabilities, nascent or advanced, of other players in the global arena, particularly <b>regional</b> <b>organizations...</b>|$|R

However, there is little study on which agent play a more effective role as preventer. Based on examination in this article, <b>regional</b> <b>organizations</b> are inherently more likely to embody conditions which help to increase the effectiveness of preventive strategy. Therefore, <b>regional</b> <b>organizations</b> should take initiative, interacting with other international preventive agents and incorporating their actions...|$|R
