Formative evaluation, the process of critically reviewing work to improve it, is emphasized, and checklists that summarize IRB criteria and standards and present the critical content of <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> for studies involving human participants are provided.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the students’ ability and problems in writing a <b>research</b> <b>proposal.</b> This study used a case study method, particularly text analysis. The participants {{of this study were}} nine students and two lecturers of an undergraduate English study program in one university in Banten. This study employed two data collection techniques, i. e. the documentation of students’ <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> and interview. The data were, then, analyzed based on the theory of genre analysis and SFL, and validated by triangulation and member checks. The study reveals three findings related to the research questions. First, despite their ability in the discourse semantic level, most students still have problems in achieving the communicative purpose of each major element in a <b>research</b> <b>proposal.</b> Second, the main causes of the problems are the students’ unfamiliarity and lack of knowledge in terms of the elements and linguistic features required in a <b>research</b> <b>proposal.</b> Finally, the solutions that can be proposed to solve the students’ problems are guidance, assistance, and explicit teaching for the students in writing the elements and linguistic features of a <b>research</b> <b>proposal.</b> It is thus recommended that all the subjects related to writing and research should allow students to have the capacity needed in writing a <b>research</b> <b>proposal...</b>|$|R

40|$|Writing a <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> {{can be a}} {{challenging}} task for young researchers. This article explains {{how to write a}} strong <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> to apply for funding, specifically, a <b>proposal</b> for The <b>Research</b> Council (TRC) of Oman. Three different <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> application forms are currently used in TRC, including Open Research Grant (ORG), Graduate Research Support Program (GRSP), and Faculty-mentored Undergraduate Research Award Program (FURAP). The application forms are filled and submitted electronically on TRC website. Each of the proposals submitted to TRC is selected through a rigorous reviewing and screening process. Novelty and originality of the research idea is the most crucial element in writing a <b>research</b> <b>proposal.</b> Performing an in-depth review of the literature will assist you to compose a good researchable question and generate a strong hypothesis. The development of a good hypothesis will offer insight into the specific objectives of a study. Research objectives should be focused, measurable, and achievable by a specific time using the most appropriate methodology. Moreover, it is essential to select a proper study design in-line with {{the purpose of the study}} and the hypothesis. Furthermore, social/economic impact and reasonable budget of proposed research are important criteria in <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> evaluation by TRC.

40|$|As {{part of the}} {{requirements}} for the award of degrees in higher education institutions, students at undergraduate and postgraduate levels normally carry out research, which they report {{in the form of}} dissertations or theses. The research journey commences with the selection of a research topic and the preparation of a proposal on the selected topic. Experience has shown that students tend to encounter difficulties in writing <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> for their supervisors because they do not fully comprehend what constitutes a <b>research</b> <b>proposal.</b> The {{purpose of this article is}} to take students through a step-by-step process of writing good <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> by discussing the essential ingredients of a good <b>research</b> <b>proposal.</b> Thus, it is not a didactic piece—the aim is to guide students in <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> writing. In discussing these ingredients, relevant examples are provided where necessary for ease of understanding. It is expected that on reading this article, students should be able to: (a) demonstrate knowledge and understanding of what research is all about and its challenging nature; (b) display an enlarged comprehension of research gap(s), problem or question(s), aim, objectives, and hypotheses as well as their distinguishing characteristics; (c) demonstrate a good understanding of the relevant elements to be considered in the constituent sections of a good research proposal; and (d) comprehend the elements of a <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> that should feature in the final written dissertation or thesis...|$|R

40|$|This seminar {{focuses on}} the design of {{research}} and the preparation of a <b>research</b> <b>proposal.</b> First, we review how to conceptualize and communicate a research design: what is the logic of research? What are the logics of anthropological research, across the subfields and theoretical paradigms? How are <b>research</b> <b>proposals</b> put together? For whom are they written? And what criteria are used to evaluate them? We also examine different kinds of research, how research is conceptualized within each genre, and the creation of effective designs and proposals. We will also review and critique examples of funded <b>research</b> <b>proposals.</b> The focus on proposals is useful not only because grant writing is an important skill in its own right, but also because an effective proposal requires a rigorous approach to research, to representing all elements of research design and how they fit together—from statement of the problem to data analysis and statement of significance.

40|$|Qualitative {{research}} in the health sciences has had to overcome many prejudices {{and a number of}} misunderstandings, but today qualitative research is as acceptable as quantitative research designs and is widely funded and published. Writing the proposal of a qualitative study, however, can be a challenging feat, due to the emergent nature of the qualitative research design and the description of the methodology as a process. Even today, many sub-standard proposals at post-graduate evaluation committees and application proposals to be considered for funding are still seen. This problem has led the researcher to develop a framework to guide the qualitative researcher in writing the proposal of a qualitative study based on the following research questions: (i) What is the process of writing a qualitative <b>research</b> <b>proposal?</b> and (ii) What does the structure and layout of a qualitative proposal look like? The {{purpose of this article is}} to discuss the process of writing the qualitative <b>research</b> <b>proposal,</b> as well as describe the structure and layout of a qualitative <b>research</b> <b>proposal.</b> The process of writing a qualitative <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> is discussed with regards to the most important questions that need to be answered in your <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> with consideration of the guidelines of being practical, being persuasive, making broader links, aiming for crystal clarity and planning before you write. While the structure of the qualitative <b>research</b> <b>proposal</b> is discussed with regards to the key sections of the proposal, namely the cover page, abstract, introduction, review of the literature, research problem and research questions, research purpose and objectives, research paradigm, research design, research method, ethical considerations, dissemination plan, budget and appendices...|$|R
