5|$|Menem {{supported}} the Washington Consensus, and tackled inflation with the Convertibility plan in 1991. The plan was complemented {{by a series}} of privatizations, and was a success. Argentina re-established diplomatic <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom, suspended since the 1982 Falklands War, and developed special <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United States. The country suffered two terrorist attacks. The Peronist victory in the 1993 midterm elections allowed him to force Alfonsín to sign the Pact of Olivos for the 1994 amendment of the Argentine Constitution. This amendment allowed Menem to run for re-election in 1995, which he won. A new economic crisis began, and the opposing parties formed a political coalition that won the 1997 midterm elections and the 1999 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|As was {{the case}} with his grandfather, Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan Iskandar's {{independent}} mindset resulted in strained <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Malaysian federal government on numerous occasions.

5|$|Carney's {{appointment}} to diplomatic postings {{in countries that}} had often difficult <b>relations</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United States earned him both praise and criticism from observers for his hands-on diplomatic style.
