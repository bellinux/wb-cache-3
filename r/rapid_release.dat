5|$|In {{explosive}} eruptions, {{the eruption}} of magma {{is driven by the}} <b>rapid</b> <b>release</b> of pressure, often involving the explosion of gas previously dissolved within the material. The most famous and destructive historical eruptions are mainly of this type. An eruptive phase can consist of a single eruption, or a sequence of several eruptions spread over several days, weeks or months. Explosive eruptions usually involve thick, highly viscous, silicic or felsic magma, high in volatiles like water vapor and carbon dioxide. Pyroclastic materials are the primary product, typically in the form of tuff. Eruptions the size of that at Lake Toba 74,000 years ago, at least , or the Yellowstone eruption 620,000 years ago, around , occur worldwide every 50,000 to 100,000years.|$|E
5|$|The <b>rapid</b> <b>release</b> of Przemysł II {{could have}} been aided by the {{intervention}} of Leszek II the Black and Mestwin II of Pomerelia. The reason {{for the arrival of}} Mestwin II to Greater Poland, in addition to helping his imprisoned ally, was to settle the claims of the Teutonic Order over parts of Pomerelia and to resolve the issue of succession after his own death; from his first marriage, Mestwin II had only two daughters, Catherine and Euphemia. The situation was further {{complicated by the fact that}} Mestwin II gained the rule over all the Duchy of Pomerelia after a war against his uncles, Racibor and Sambor II, who in revenge for this willed his possessions (including Białogard and Gniew) to the Teutonic Order upon his death in 1278.|$|E

In order to study how those metrics changed after Firefox’s adoption of <b>rapid</b> <b>releases,</b> we compute them for two periods, one during which Firefox was developed with traditional releases, and another one during in which it was developed with <b>rapid</b> <b>releases</b> and integration repositories. In this analysis, the transitional period is ignored, since it is not representative of either traditional or <b>rapid</b> <b>releases.</b>|$|R

2500|$|Car {{batteries}} {{are most likely}} to explode when a short-circuit generates very large currents. Such batteries produce hydrogen, which is very explosive, when they are overcharged (because of electrolysis of the water in the electrolyte). During normal use, the amount of overcharging is usually very small and generates little hydrogen, which dissipates quickly. However, when [...] "jump starting" [...] a car, the high current can cause the <b>rapid</b> <b>release</b> of large volumes of hydrogen, which can be ignited explosively by a nearby spark, e.g. when disconnecting a jumper cable.|$|E
2500|$|Rowland was {{a strong}} proponent of a tough stance against violent crime as governor. The prison {{population}} grew rapidly during his term, which caused the state to send inmates to prisons in Virginia to deal with overcrowding. Legislative opponents of this policy such as Representative Michael Lawlor urged more <b>rapid</b> <b>release</b> of nonviolent offenders. After Rowland left office the Virginia inmates were returned to Connecticut and more criminals were paroled. This approach was criticized after the 2007 Cheshire home invasion murders committed by two [...] "nonviolent" [...] inmates paroled from Connecticut prison.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, an {{emergency}} application brings in an additional component of each car's air brake system: the emergency portion. The triple valve {{is divided into}} two portions: the service portion, which contains the mechanism used during brake applications made during service reductions, and the emergency portion, which senses the immediate, <b>rapid</b> <b>release</b> of train line pressure. In addition, each car's air brake reservoir {{is divided into two}} portions—the service portion and the emergency portion—and is known as the [...] "dual-compartment reservoir”. Normal service applications transfer air pressure from the service portion to the brake cylinder, while emergency applications cause the triple valve to direct all air in both the service portion and the emergency portion of the dual-compartment reservoir to the brake cylinder, resulting in a 20–30% stronger application.|$|E
60|$|The {{problem which}} was already being mooted by such {{scientific}} men as Ramsay, Rutherford, and Soddy, {{in the very beginning}} of the twentieth century, the problem of inducing radio-activity in the heavier elements and so tapping the internal energy of atoms, was solved by a wonderful combination of induction, intuition, and luck by Holsten so soon as the year 1933. From the first detection of radio-activity to its first subjugation to human purpose measured little more than a quarter of a century. For twenty years after that, indeed, minor difficulties prevented any striking practical application of his success, but the essential thing was done, this new boundary in the march of human progress was crossed, in that year. He set up atomic disintegration in a minute particle of bismuth; it exploded with great violence into a heavy gas of extreme radio-activity, which disintegrated in its turn in the course of seven days, and it was only after another year's work that he was able to show practically that the last result of this <b>rapid</b> <b>release</b> of energy was gold. But the thing was done--at the cost of a blistered chest and an injured finger, and from the moment when the invisible speck of bismuth flashed into riving and rending energy, Holsten knew that he had opened a way for mankind, however narrow and dark it might still be, to worlds of limitless power. He recorded as much in the strange diary biography he left the world, a diary that was up to that particular moment a mass of speculations and calculations, and which suddenly became for a space an amazingly minute and human record of sensations and emotions that all humanity might understand.|$|E
