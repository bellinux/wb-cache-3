60|$|From {{cases such as}} the foregoing, {{in which}} the {{offspring}} {{of the first generation}} perfectly resemble either parent, we come by a small step to those cases in which differently coloured flowers borne on the same root resemble both parents, and by another step to those in which the same flower or fruit is striped or blotched with the two parental colours, or bears a single stripe of the colour or other characteristic quality of one of the parent-forms. With hybrids and mongrels it frequently or even generally happens that one part of the body resembles more or less closely one parent and another part the other parent; and here again some <b>resistence</b> to fusion, or, what comes to the same thing, some mutual affinity between the organic atoms of the same nature, apparently comes into play, for otherwise all parts of the body would be equally intermediate in character. So again, when the offspring of hybrids or mongrels, which are themselves nearly intermediate in character, revert either wholly or by segments to their ancestors, the principle of the affinity of similar, or the repulsion of dissimilar atoms, must come into action. To this principle, which seems to be extremely general, we shall recur in the chapter on pangenesis.|$|E

In all of which there is not only a considerable high Hill raised about the mouth of the Vulcan, but, like the spots of the Moon, the top of those Hills are like a dish, or bason. And indeed, if one attentively consider the nature of the thing, one may find sufficient reason to judge, that it cannot be otherwise; for these eruptions, whether of fire, or smoak, alwayes raysing great quantities of Earth before them, must necessarily, by the fall of those parts on either side, raise very considerable heaps.|$|E

The author thinks that the emergence of Pegon Script was based on primordial and political reasons. It is because most of the Javanese people were still using symbols and beliefs previous. Therefore syncretism is a theological fact of the conversion process is not yet complete culture in the Islamization of the Javanese people. Aculturation between Arabic letters and the Java language has become a barometer of local independence Islam in Java since centuries ago.

This situation can be seen in the socio-historical context which showed that the colonialism era was ongoing on Java in the eighteenth to nineteenth century.

40|$|The {{reaction}} rate of starch hydrolysis catalyzed by a glucoamylase covalently bound to chitin particles {{was measured in}} a Differential Fixed-Bed Reactor (DFBR). Under selected test conditions the initial {{reaction rate}} may represent biocatalyst activity. Some aspects which influence measurement of the initial reaction rate of an immobilized enzyme were studied: the amount of desorbed enzyme and its hydrolytic activity, the extent of pore blockage of the biocatalyst caused by substrate solution impurities and {{the internal and external}} diffusional mass transfer effects. The results showed that the enzyme glucoamylase was firmly bound to the support, as indicated by the very low amount of desorbed protein found in the recirculating liquid. Although this protein was very active, its contribution to the overall reaction rate was negligible. It was observed that the biocatalyst pores were susceptible to being blocked by the impurities of the starch solution. This latter effect was accumulative, increasing with the number of sequential experiments carried out. When the substrate solution was filtered before use, very reliable determinations of immobilized enzyme reaction rates could be performed in the DFBR.

40|$|Candida is a genus of {{opportunistic}} yeast {{that are}} usually harmless residents of the oral cavity, but they become pathogenic under conditions which allow them to increase their proportion to {{other members of the}} oral microflora. Correct and accurate identification of the candidal species infecting an oral candidiasis patient is important due to antifungal drug <b>resistences.</b> The region in the fungal genome that contains the gene that codes for rRNA, also known as rDNA, {{has been found to be}} useful for phylogenetic studies and species identification. The purpose of this study is to compare the candidal loads of denture wearers, periodontal disease patients, and a control group, in addition to differentiating isolated oral Candida sp. based on rDNA, in order to assess the effectiveness of using the rDNA region for candidal species identification. Samples from the saliva and the surfaces of the palate, tongue and cheek mucosa were collected from 45 individuals consisting of three target groups: periodontal disease patients, denture wearers with healthy oral cavity, and non-denture wearers with healthy oral cavity as the control group. The samples were subjected to serial dilution and spread on agar plates, which were then scored for Colony-Forming Units (CFUs). Next, fifteen random candidal colonies were isolated and subjected to genomic DNA extraction based on glass beads disruption. ITS 1, ITS 2, ITS 3 and ITS 4 primers were used to amplify regions in the rDNA, and the ITSI- 5. 8 S-ITSII region was then digested by HinfI and MspI restriction enzymes. The microbial loads on all the sites of denture wearers groups was found to be significantly higher than the control group, while only the microbial loads on the tongue surface of the periodontal disease group was significantly higher than in the control group, while at all the other sites there was no significant difference. Comparing the restriction fragment lengths of the clinical samples to that of seven ATCC control species allowed the identification of Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida dubliniensis and Candida glabrata (C. krusei and C. lusitaniae were also among the iii ATCC control species and could be differentiated, but none of the clinical samples were of those species). One clinical sample had a unique band and restriction fragment pattern that could not be matched to any of the control species, however based on the band sizes it is most likely to be Candida famata. The MspI restriction digest was not able to distinguish between C. albicans and C. dubliniensis, whereas the HinfI digest could not distinguish between C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis. In conclusion, candidal colonization in denture wearers, while there appears to be no significant difference in periodontal patients other than on the tongue surface.

In the theoretical-methodological construction it searches aids in the thinking of Michel Foucault, Erving Goffman, Carlos Skliar, Jorge Larrosa, in legal documents that deals with handicapped rights, as well as analysis of testimonials from people (handicapped and handicapped’s mothers) that contributed with their life stories. In this perspective, a bibliographical research has been developed, with the purpose of diving in the complexity of the relation with the handicapped “other”, using as theoretical-methodological procedure the notions of archeology and genealogy in Foucault, articulately to the fields of moral and aesthetical problematization of the handicapped body. Among the points of discussion, stands the questioning that nowadays one lives an education in support of the inclusion paradigm, without, however, problematizing untouched aspects in this territory under other’s government. The text moves itself through three interconnected dimensions: the “mourning” (interdiction) of the handicapped body in the intricacies of historical normality, the “fight” (<b>resistences)</b> for legal achievements in the educational setting and of the “ethical-aesthetic” (difference) of the possible handicapped body, a body that in Larrosa’s vision “goes from the impossible to the truthful”, being the vector of its own aesthetic experience, a moral inquisitor body, capable of reinventing itself and of recreating new settings of difference in education. O presente estudo dissertativo propõe-se a discutir, no âmbito da Filosofia Foucaultiana e Pensamento da Diferença em Educação, a perspectiva de um corpo deficiente possível pensado enquanto limiar de um novo corpo político. Discute o paradigma da inclusão e tensiona a trajetória histórica dos estudos sobre o corpo deficiente em sua relação/ conflito com a normalidade, tendo como pontos de interseção a genealogia foucaultiana e os estudos da diferença no campo educacional. Na construção teórico-metodológica busca subsídios no pensamento de Michel Foucault, Erving Goffman, Carlos Skliar, Jorge Larrosa, nos documentos legais que tratam dos direitos dos deficientes, além da análise de depoimentos de pessoas (deficientes e mães de deficientes) que contribuíram com suas histórias de vida. Nesta perspectiva, desenvolveu-se uma pesquisa de cunho bibliográfico, na intenção de mergulhar na complexidade da relação com o “outro” deficiente, utilizando como procedimento teórico-metodológico as noções de arqueologia e genealogia em Foucault, articuladamente aos campos da problematização da moral e da estética do corpo deficiente. Dentre os pontos de discussão, sobressai o questionamento de que atualmente se vive uma educação em defesa do paradigma da inclusão, sem, contudo, problematizar aspectos intocados nesse território de governo do outro. O texto se movimenta por três dimensões interligadas: do luto (interditos) do corpo deficiente nos meandros da normalidade histórica, da luta (resistências) por conquistas legais no cenário educacional, e de uma ética-estética (diferença) do corpo deficiente possível, um corpo que na visão de Larrosa “vai do impossível ao verdadeiro”, sendo vetor de sua própria experiência estética, um corpo inquiridor da moral, capaz de se reinventar e de recriar novos cenários da diferença na educação...|$|R
40|$|Esta dissertação pretende contribuir para as discussões referentes à questão da fonnação do {{professor}} de língua inglesa, através da investigação do discurso de sala de aula da disciplina Prática de Ensino de Língua Inglesa (doravante PELI) e suas implicações para a prática pedagógica desse professor. Partimos da hipótese de que a PELL embora se proponha a preparar o futuro professor para uma realidade heterogênea e complexa que é a sala de aula, trabalha na perspectiva de um modelo pré-fixado como forma de contornar a heterogeneidade da sala de aula e, assim, garantir a aprendizagem. Ao se deparar com conflitos na sala de aula, a PELI procura abafá-Ios, homogeneizando o processo de formação e limitando-se à legitimação e instrumentalizãção do professor de língua inglesa. Mediante uma abordagem discursiva de análise, e das noções de prática discursiva (Foucault, 1969) e de heterogeneidade do discurso (Authier, 1990) e da sala de aula (Cor_ 1997), buscamos, então, verificar as regularidades que transfonnam a PELI. em um discurso fonnador autorizado e, ao fazê-Io, deparamo-nos com a emergência indesejada da heterogeneidade constitutiva da sala de aula. Para tanto, analisamos os documentos legisladores da disciplina, as entrevistas infonnais. e questionários feitos com alunos de PELI, bem como gravações de aulas de PELI de três instituições brasileiras de nível superior. A análise do corpus mostrou que as práticas discursivas da sala de aula de PELI apresentam conflitos que desestabilizam a linearidade e a homogeneidade aparente desse discurso, instaurando contradições e resistências no seio mesmo do discurso autorizado. Os registros sugerem que, na tensão entre a heterogeneidade da sala de aula e a necessidade de controlá-Ia para garantir a aprendizagem, a PELI promove, além da legitimação do futuro professor, a forma(ta) ção de professores dentro de uma determinada abordagem de ensino. Assim, enquanto espaço de formação, ela apresenta a contradição de querer homogeneizar o que não é homogeneizável: a sala de aula, espaço constituído de conflitos e contradições. This dissertation aims at {{contributing to}} the discussions concerning English teacher "formation". For this reason, it investigates the classroom discourse of the subject The Teaching Practice of English (TPE) and its implication for the pedagogical practice of the future English teacher. The starting point of this research deals {{with the role of}} the TPE Ín the preparation of future teachers of English for a heterogeneous and complex reality which characterizes the classroom. In addition, the TPE utilizes a pre-determined model as a way to avoid heterogeneity. Instead of dealing with the conflicts of the classroom, the TPE smothers them, making the "formation" process homogeneous and limited to the legitimization and instrumentation ofthe English teacher. Through a discursive approach of analysis and via the notion of discursive practices (Foucault, 1969) and the heterogeneity of discourse Authier, 1990) and the heterogeneity of classroom discourse (Coracini, 1997), we have examined the regularities that changed the TPE into a authorized "formation" discourse. By doing so, we have faced the undesired emergence of heterogeneity that constitutes the classroom. In order to achieve this goal, we have analyzed documents that rule the subject TPE, the informal interviews and questionnaires applied to TPE students. Tape recordings ITom three different institutions were also part of the material analyzed. The analysis has shown that the classroom discursive practices of TPE is marked with conflicts that make the apparent homogeneity of this discourse instable. Contradictions and <b>resistences</b> of this so called authorized discourse are also pointed out. The data still suggest that, it is in' the tension between the classroom heterogeneity and the necessity of controlling it to guarantee learning, the TPE promotes, in addition to the legitimization of the future English teacher, the "forma(ta) tion" of teacher within a pre-determined teaching approach. Thus, the TPE, while a forum for teacher reflection, presents the contradiction of desiring of homogenizing what is not homogeneizable: the classroom, characterized by conflicts and contradictions...|$|R
40|$|The author {{describes}} the first cases of spontaneous leishmaniasis in guinea-pigs, as verified {{for the first}} time, in Curitiba, at the Institute of Biology and Technological Research. Studying the inoculability of Paracoccidioide brasiliensis in guinea-pigs, he found animals which presented tumoral lesions in the ears and peritesticular skin. The examination of these tumors, mixed with a small drop of Giemsa's original solution, plus the exam of the rubbings of the same material, coloured by the May-Grunwald Giemsa after fixation by Heidenhein's solution and the histological exams of the cuts in the tumoral lesions revealed the presence of elements which possessed the same morphology and aspect of the LEISHMAN-DONOVANI corpuscles. In the meanwhile, a parasitosis by protozoarians of the Leishmania variety might have been suspected, because large macrophagi {{could be seen in}} the histological cuts, all parazitized, identical with those which are found in other cutaneous leishmaniosis. The author then proceeds to the experimental study of the sickness, first by endeavouring to obtain material for the inoculation and cultures, by means of punctures in the tumors. Part of the product of the punctures was sown in N. N. N. medium and part inoculated in other guinea-pigs. After the third day the cultures presented the flagellated forms of the parasite, free or grouped in rosettes in the culture liquid. All the guinea-pigs inoculated with part of the material obtained by puncturing and with the liquids of the cultures, reproduced the tumors found in the animals spontaneously infected. With a view to reproducing the same features of generalization which were observed in other experimental animals, with other strains of leishmania, new animals were inoculated after having been tarred and blocked in order to attempt the breaking down of possible natural <b>resistences,</b> which proved unnecessary, however, for the generalization went on of itself naturally and without artifice. Inoculations were made by the subcutaneous, intraperitonial, intrasplenic, intramedular, intracerebral and endovenous channels and by instillation in the conjunctive, in those guinea-pigs which received subcutaneous inoculations, the incubation period varied between 11 and 15 days, this period being longer when the internal channels were used, when it was generally one or two months before the lesions appeared. When the lesions are on the skin or when the inoculation is done there, the first manifestations of lesions are characterized by a slight thickening of the subcutaneous tissue, which, little by little, becomes more consistent, giving place to a tumoral growth which attains great volume and characterizes the most developed phase. The lesions, when metastatic, are localized mostly in the tegumentary extremities and periarticular zones, having the same appearance as the lesions observed by other researchers who have studied the infection of hamsters, mice and dogs infected by L. donovani, L. infantum and L. tropica. The experiments carried out in all the tumoral lesions in guinea-pigs, were positive for leishmania, where they were found free in the tissues or parasitizing large macrophagi. At times the tumors ulcerate and become covered with a crusty layer, easily detachable, covering a rosy surface of granulomatosis aspect. The spleen and lymphatic ganglia are the internal organs which most react, hypertrophy always being present, and it has been possible to re-isolate the parasite of these organs {{as well as those of}} the liver, suprarenal, testicle, medulla of the bones and cardiac blood. A series of sixty guinea-pigs were inoculated in the skin of the nose and sacrificed within anything from a few minutes' up to twenty-four hours' interval. The material obtained from these animals was fixed in Bouin-Hollande, included in paraffin and coloured by hematoxilin-eosine and Maxinow's hematoxilin-azur II-eosine. The study of the histological cuts in the different periods of evolution showed that the inflammatory process passes through a series of modifications which start by an acute inflammatory phase followed by a simple granulomatosis phase, finally followed by another characterized exclusively by large parasitized macrophagi - the macrophagi phase. During the period of evolution of the inflammatory lesion, the infiltrative phenomena are constant and are at first constituted of granulocited neutrophils, eosinophils and mononuclear cells, followed by a preponderance of monocytes and lastly by the sole presence of large parasitized macrophagi. The author compares his findings in the guinea-pigs with those in other animals inoculated with different strain of Leishmania, calling attention to a real dermatropism of the parasite under study to its dissemination through the lymphatic channels and to the histologycal lesions identical to those other leishmaniosis, principally by those produced by L. tropica...|$|R

40|$|Measurement of {{intravesical}} pressure {{was performed in}} 4 3 patients with traumatic spinal cord injury. At the same time, investigation on the method of measurement, experiments of urethral resistance and studies on effects of autonomic nerve drugs upon these values were examined. 1) According {{to the results of}} retrograde contineous measurement of the {{intravesical pressure}}, the cases were classified into 1 hypotonic, 18 autonomic, 15 automatic and 9 mixed types. 2) With the method of my own, the urethral <b>resistence</b> was measured and the results were analysed in relation to the intravesical pressure, the maximum voluntary pressure and the residual urine volume. It was found that much more volume of residual urine and lowered bladder efficiency are demonstrated when the urethral <b>resistence</b> is higher than or even equal to the maximum voluntary pressure. 3) Effects of subcutaneously injec t e d drugs upon the intravesical pressure, maximum voluntary pressure, capacity of the bladder and urethral <b>resistence</b> were examined. With Besacoline injection, an increase in the intravesical pressure and a decrease in the capacity of the bladder were found. The maximum voluntary pressure showed slight decrease and the urethral <b>resistence</b> become unchanged or decreased. With Atropin injection, though the curve of t h e intravesical pressure showed invariable figure, a slight increase in the capacity of the bladder, a somewhat decrease in the maximum voluntary pressure and no change or a little increase in the urethral <b>resistence</b> were demonstrated. With Epirenamin injection, the intravesical pressure showed a decrease with an altration of the pressure curve until occasional occurrence of hypertonic situations, but the effects were rather slight in all instances. The maximum voluntary pressure remained unchanged and the urethral <b>resistence</b> showed an increase. With Wintermin injection, no noticea b le change was seen in the figure of the intravesical pressure curve while a trend of decrease in the capacity of the bladder and a slight decrease in the maximum voluntary pressure were demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Defensive {{chemical}} and nutritive quality of young leaves were measured for 72 individual trees of Chrysolepis [Castanopsis] chrysophylla {{in conjunction with}} light intensities of two different stand types and population numbers of Habrodais grunus herri in the Cascade mountains of Oregon. Leaves were collected {{in the spring and}} leaf characteristics such as condensed tannins, nitrogen (crude protein), lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, leaf <b>resistence,</b> and water content were measured. Light intensities were measured for each tree in the two stand types, clear-cut and old-growth stands. Population numbers H. grunus herri were measured by timed beating of each individual tree previous to leaf collection. Population numbers of H. grunus herri were significantly different between stand types. In most cases larva of the butterfly failed to show up in timed beatings of trees in the clear-cut stands compared to equal length timed beatings in old-growth stands. The two stand types, that were significantly different in light intensities, were found to be have trees that had significantly different levels of nitrogen (crude protein), leaf <b>resistence,</b> and water content. Old-growth stands had significantly higher levels of nitrogen, and lower levels of leaf <b>resistence</b> and water content. The leaf <b>resistence</b> was found to be explained by a combination of the leaves' lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose content.
