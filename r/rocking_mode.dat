40|$|A Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) based {{directional}} microphone {{consisting of two}} plates hinged at the center is modeled using finite element software. A new method is developed in which the sensor is acoustically coupled to an incoming sound wave. The method successfully reproduces results of previous non-acoustic coupled simulations for solid plates. The resonance frequencies match within 0. 8 % for the <b>rocking</b> <b>mode</b> and 2 % for the bending mode. The displacement amplitudes match within 17 % for the <b>rocking</b> <b>mode</b> and 5 % for the bending mode. After ensuring agreement with previous simulations, the model was extended to include more realistic boundary conditions. The sound pressure {{at the back of}} the plates is included along with the drag force on the plates due to the acoustic particle velocity flow. This new model reproduces the experimentally achieved resonance frequency values within 21 % for the <b>rocking</b> <b>mode</b> and 2 % for the bending mode. The displacement amplitude obtained for the <b>rocking</b> <b>mode</b> is approximately 6 times lower than the experimental value while the bending mode amplitude is 47 % higher. Manufacturing tolerances for these MEMS devices likely contribute to the discrepancy between simulated and experimental values. A novel design is proposed for increasing the displacement amplitude for both solid and perforated plates through the use of a Helmholtz resonator. Hellenic Navy author...|$|E

40|$|Two {{large scale}} 9 m radius {{centrifuge}} {{tests were conducted}} at the NEES@UCDavis experimental facility to understand the interaction between soft peat and stiffer levee fills, to gain insight into the volume change behavior of organic soils under cyclic loading, and to study deformation potential of saturated sandy levees resting on peat due to liquefaction of the levee fill. This study has potential applicability to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta where unengineered levee fills rest atop soft compressible peat soils. This paper focuses on the interaction between a nonliquefiable clay levee resting atop soft peat during application of a sine sweep base excitation.

40|$|Design and {{evaluation}} of building during earthquake is moved to be a performance based one. For the performance based design, behaviors of buildings are clarified more precisely based on data of earthquake motion observation. But in general buildings, the earthquake motion observation is not popular, especially, for purpose of soil structure interaction (SSI). Under a few points of accelerometers, a detailed analysis for SSI phenomena is not easy and many assumptions are needed. Here, the SSI effects of building are investigated based on a microtremor measurement. The instruments were set in the building {{and on the ground}} to evaluate the sway, rocking and torsional vibrations. The building is 7 -storied residential one with flamed structure in longitudinal direction and pre-cast walled structure in transverse direction. Through transfer functions of buildings, predominant frequencies under sway, <b>rocking</b> <b>mode</b> and those of based-fixed condition are calculated. The SSI effect is remarkable in transverse direction due to predominant <b>rocking</b> <b>mode.</b> Also based on the random decrement technique, the damping factor of buildings is obtained.

40|$|The two chevron notched {{specimen}} geometries for <b>rock</b> <b>Mode</b> I {{fracture toughness}} measurement, CB and SR, {{recommended by the}} ISRM have several disadvantages, such as very low loads required to initiate failure, complicated loading fixtures, difficult to be developed for <b>rock</b> mixed <b>mode</b> fracture testing, relatively large amounts of intact rock core needed for the test and complex specimen preparation for the SR geometry. The cracked chevron notched Brazilian disc (CCNBD) and the cracked straight through Brazilian disc (CSTBD) specimen geometries overcome these problems and they {{are believed to be}} ideal geometries for rock fracture investigations. The general case for the cracked Brazilian disc fracture problem is when the specimen is loaded diametrically with the crack inclined at an angle to the loading direction. Different combinations of Mode I and Mode II fracture intensities can be obtained simply by changing this angle and the loading fixture still remains as simple as for a normal Brazilian test. A special superimposition technique is developed to theoretically solve the stress intensity factor (SW) values for the CSTBD fracture problem with the help of dislocation and complex stress function methods. This evaluation can generate accurate SIF results for the problem with any crack length a(a/R) = 0. 05 - 0. 95, while the mixed mode SIF solution for a> 0. 60 has not been reached by previous researchers. The relative theoretical SW solution for the corresponding CCNBD fracture problem (single or mixed fracture modes) is obtained by using Bluhm's slice model proposed for general crack problems. Numerical calibrations for Mode I fracture problems of the CSTBD and the CCNBD specimens have been conducted by using 194 different specimen geometries and the results prove the correctness of the theoretical evaluations. The valid CCNBD geometrical range for a valid <b>rock</b> <b>Mode</b> I fracture toughness test is numerically investigated and then experimentally validated based on 40 different CCNBD geometries by using 42 different rocks. Experimental studies on the minimum specimen size requirement for a valid CCNBD <b>rock</b> <b>Mode</b> I fracture toughness test are also carried out and the approximate critical criteria is given. The great advantages of using the CCNBD specimens for rock fracture toughness measurement have been investigated and the documentation for recommending the CCNBD specimen geometry to the ISRM as the third suggested method for <b>rock</b> <b>Mode</b> I fracture toughness test is presented. The <b>rock</b> <b>Mode</b> I fracture toughness values are then related to rock conventional properties for the purpose of prediction. Rock cutting mechanics is analyzed by probabilistic fracture mechanics and Weibull's distribution model is found to better express the characteristics of rock cutting performance parameters. Some initial predictions for these parameters based on this mode are then presented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractColloidal spheres {{attached}} to a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) produce the so-called “coupled resonances”. They are resonators of their own, characterized by a particle resonance frequency, a resonance bandwidth, and a modal mass. When {{the frequency of the}} main resonator comes close to the frequency of the coupled resonance, the bandwidth goes through a maximum. A coupled resonance can be viewed as an absorption line in acoustic shear-wave spectroscopy. The known concepts from spectroscopy apply. This includes the mode assignment problem, selection rules, and the oscillator strength. In this work, the mode assignment problem was addressed with Finite Element calculations. These reveal that a rigid sphere in contact with a QCM displays two modes of vibration, termed “slipping” and “rocking”. In the slipping mode, the sphere rotates about its center; it exerts a tangential force onto the resonator surface at the point of contact. In the <b>rocking</b> <b>mode,</b> the sphere rotates about the point of contact; it exerts a torque onto the substrate. In liquids, both axes of rotation are slightly displaced from their ideal positions. Characteristic for spectroscopy, the two modes do not couple to the mechanical excitation equally well. The degree of coupling is quantified by an oscillator strength. Because the <b>rocking</b> <b>mode</b> mostly exerts a torque (rather than a tangential force), its coupling to the resonator's tangential motion is weak; the oscillator strength consequently is small. Recent experiments on surface-adsorbed colloidal spheres {{can be explained by the}} mode of vibration being of the rocking type...|$|E

The peak loads {{were up to}} a factor of 4. 8 higher then {{in the case of}} the Friaul earthquake. The HDR reactor building, which was not designed againt earthquake, withstood those loads without global failure. The <b>rocking</b> <b>mode</b> frequency dropped from about 1. 5 Hz to 1. 0 Hz while increasing the load, which corresponds to a reduction of the soil stiffness by a factor of about two. Damping values for the <b>rocking</b> <b>mode</b> incrased from about 6 to 9 % and 5. 2 to 8. 8 %, for the bending mode from 2. 7 to 3. 5 % and 4. 6 to 6 %, depending on the direction of vibration. While peak accelerations and displacements in the building reached maxima of 0. 4 g and 5 cm respectively, local damage such as concrete cracking, but no basement uplift and no soil liquefaction occurred. Circumferential cracking around the building and soil subsidence of about 10 cm could be observ ed. The calculations could describe the principal behavior of the building, but in some cases they showed up much conservatism; e. g. the load bearing capacity of the foundation slab was predicted to be 22. 000 kgm (conservative) and 38. 000 kgm (best estimate), while 67. 000 kgm were reached, or the propagation of accelerations in the free field were measured to be roughly up to 5 times smaller then those predicted by calculations...|$|E

40|$|Correlation field splittings of the {{vibrational}} {{modes of}} methylene chains in lipid bilayers, isolated lipid molecules in perdeuterated lipid bilayers, crystalline lipid, and interdigitated lipid bilayers {{have been investigated}} by pressure-tuning Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The correlation field splittings of these modes are originating from the vibrational coupling interactions between the fully extended methylene chains with different site symmetry along each bilayer leaflet. The interchain-interactions of the methylene chains with the same site symmetry only contribute to frequency shift of the vibrational modes. The magnitude of the correlation field splitting {{is a measure of}} the strength of the interchain-interactions, and the relative intensities of the correlation field component bands provide information concerning the relative orientation of the zig-zag planes of the interacting methylene chains. It has been demonstrated in the present work that the correlation field splitting of the CH 2 bending and <b>rocking</b> <b>modes</b> commonly observed in the vibrational spectra of lipid bilayers is the result of the intermolecular interchain-interactions among the methylene chains of the neighboring molecules. The intramolecular interchain-interactions between the sn- 1 and sn- 2 methylene chains within each molecule are weak. The correlation field splitting resulting from the intramolecular interchain-interactions exhibits a much smaller magnitude than that from the intermolecular interchain-interactions and is observed only at very high pressure. Interdigitation of the opposing bilayer leaflets disturbs significantly the intermolecular interchain-interactions and results in dramatic changes in the pressure profiles of the correlation field component bands of both the CH 2 bending and <b>rocking</b> <b>modes.</b> The relative intensities of the correlation field component bands of these modes and the magnitude of the splitting are also altered significantly. These results provide further evidence that the correlation field splitting of the CH 2 bending and <b>rocking</b> <b>modes</b> in the vibrational spectra of lipid bilayers is due to the intermolecular interchain-interactions. The present work has also demonstrated that the correlation field splitting of the vibrational modes in lipid bilayers is mainly contributed by the intermolecular interchain-interactions among the nearest neighboring molecules and that the long-range correlation interactions beyond the second neighboring molecules are insignificant...|$|R
