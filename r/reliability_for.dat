5|$|Fleiss' kappa (named after Joseph L. Fleiss) is a {{statistical}} measure {{for assessing the}} reliability of agreement between a fixed number of raters when assigning categorical ratings {{to a number of}} items or classifying items. This contrasts with other kappas such as Cohen's kappa, which only work when assessing the agreement between not more than two raters or the interrater <b>reliability</b> <b>for</b> one appraiser versus themself. The measure calculates the degree of agreement in classification over that which would be expected by chance. There is no generally agreed-upon measure of significance, although guidelines have been given.|$|E

40|$|Evaluation of the {{kyphosis}} angle in thoracic and lumbar burst fractures {{is often}} used to indicate surgical procedures. The kyphosis angle could be measured as vertebral, segmental and local kyphosis according to the method of Cobb. The vertebral, segmental and local kyphosis according to the method of Cobb were measured at 120 lateral X-rays and sagittal computed tomographies of 60 thoracic and 60 lumbar burst fractures by 3 independent observers on 2 separate occasions. Osteoporotic fractures were excluded. The intra- and interobserver reliability of these angles in X-ray and computed tomogram, using the intra class correlation coefficient (ICC) were evaluated. Highest reproducibility showed the segmental kyphosis followed by the vertebral kyphosis. For thoracic fractures segmental kyphosis shows in X-ray “excellent” inter- and intraobserver reliabilities (ICC 0. 826, 0. 802) and for lumbar fractures “good” to “excellent” inter- and intraobserver reliabilities (ICC =  0. 790, 0. 803). In computed tomography, the segmental kyphosis showed “excellent” inter- and intraobserver reliabilities (ICC =  0. 824, 0. 801) for thoracic and “excellent” inter- and intraobserver reliabilities (ICC =  0. 874, 0. 835) for the lumbar fractures. Regarding both diagnostic work ups (X-ray and computed tomography), significant differences were evaluated in interobserver <b>reliabilities</b> <b>for</b> vertebral kyphosis measured in lumbar fracture X-rays (p =  0. 035) and interobserver <b>reliabilities</b> <b>for</b> local kyphosis, measured in thoracic fracture X-rays (p =  0. 010). Regarding both fracture localizations (thoracic and lumbar fractures), significant differences could only be evaluated in interobserver <b>reliabilities</b> <b>for</b> the local kyphosis measured in computed tomographies (p =  0. 045) and in intraobserver <b>reliabilities</b> <b>for</b> the vertebral kyphosis measured in X-rays (p =  0. 024). “Good” to “excellent” inter- and intraobserver <b>reliabilities</b> <b>for</b> vertebral, segmental and local kyphosis in X-ray make these angles to a helpful tool, indicating surgical procedures. For the practical use in lateral X-ray, we emphasize the determination of the segmental kyphosis, because of the highest reproducibility of this angle. “Good” to “excellent” inter- and intraobserver <b>reliabilities</b> <b>for</b> these three angles could also be evaluated in computed tomographies. Therefore, also in computed tomography, the use of these three angles seems to be generally possible.

Cicero seemed to have used sophisticated photography techniques to create unusually clear images, which raised the question of whether he acted alone. Antipathy between Papen and Ribbentrop added to the ineffective analysis of the intelligence. Aware of the Allied forces attempts to bring Turkey into the war, however, Papen was able to thwart their efforts for a time by threatening to destroy İzmir and Istanbul if Turkey declared war against Germany. Being able to postpone Turkey's alliance with the Allied forces and the use of their airfields, Papen told Ribbentrop that the way was now clear to take the Balkans.|$|E

25|$|Compared to autoloading handguns, a {{revolver}} is often much simpler to operate {{and may have}} greater <b>reliability.</b> <b>For</b> example, should a semiautomatic pistol fail to fire, clearing the chamber requires manually cycling the action to remove the errant round, as cycling the action normally depends on the energy of a cartridge firing. With {{a revolver}}, this is not necessary as none of the energy for cycling the revolver comes from the firing of the cartridge, but is supplied by the user either through cocking the hammer or, in a double-action design, by just squeezing the trigger. Another significant advantage of revolvers is superior ergonomics, particularly for users with small hands. A revolver's grip does not hold a magazine, {{and it can be}} designed or customized much more than the grip of a typical semi-automatic. Partially because of these reasons, revolvers still hold significant market share as concealed carry and home-defense weapons.|$|E

25|$|Plasma arc {{loudspeakers}} use electrical plasma as a radiating element.

Problems of maintenance and <b>reliability</b> <b>for</b> this approach tend to make it unsuitable for mass market use. In 1978 Alan E. Hill of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, designed the Plasmatronics Hill Type I, a tweeter whose plasma was generated from helium gas. This avoided the ozone and nitrous oxide produced by RF decomposition of air in an earlier generation of plasma tweeters made by the pioneering DuKane Corporation, who produced the Ionovac (marketed as the Ionofane in the UK) during the 1950s. Currently, there remain a few manufacturers in Germany who use this design, and a do-it-yourself design has been published and has been available on the Internet.|$|E
25|$|The Latécoère 350, or 35-0 as it {{was first}} called, was a direct {{development}} of the successful single-engined passenger carrying Latécoère 28. To increase cruising speed and, in particular to provide <b>reliability</b> <b>for</b> night flying, the new design had three engines. Apart from the immediate changes this involved and a modest increase in wingspan, the 350 and the 28 had much in common, both in structural detail and in general appearance. Both were high wing, strut braced monoplanes with enclosed cockpits and fixed undercarriages. The two extra engines of the 350 were mounted {{at the ends of}} stub wings, more streamlined support structures than lifting surfaces, which extended horizontally from the lower fuselage longerons. Each was further stabilised by a pair of struts from {{the upper part of the}} engine mounting to the wing roots. The outer engines were mounted as close together as possible, to minimize the couple resulting from the loss of power of one of them. They were housed in long, well streamlined cowlings that reached back as far as the wing trailing edge. The third engine was in the nose, as in the Latécoère 28. All the engines were 400hp (298kW) Hispano-Suiza 12Jb V-12 twelve water-cooled units. Three separate radiators for them were fixed under the stub wing.|$|E
25|$|Surviving {{charters}} {{issued by}} the Kings of England Edmund I (939-46), Edgar (959-75), Edward the Martyr (975-8), Aethelred II (978-1016), Edmund II (1016), Cnut (1016–35) and Edward the Confessor (1042–66) record grants of land in Cornwall made by these kings. In contrast to the easterly concentration of the estates held or granted by English kings in the ninth century, the tenth and eleventh-century grants were widely distributed across Cornwall. As is usual with charters of this period, the authenticity {{of some of these}} documents is open to question (though Della Hooke has established high <b>reliability</b> <b>for</b> the Cornish material), but that of others (e.g., Edgar's grant of estates at Tywarnhaile and Bosowsa to his thane Eanulf in 960, Edward the Confessor's grant of estates at Traboe, Trevallack, Grugwith and Trethewey to Bishop Ealdred in 1059) is not in any doubt. Some of these grants include exemptions from obligations to the crown which would otherwise accompany land ownership, while retaining others, including those regarding military service. Assuming that these documents are authentic, the attachment of these obligations to the King of England to ownership of land in Cornwall suggests that the area was under his direct rule and implies that the legal and administrative relationship between the king and his subjects was the same there as elsewhere in his kingdom.|$|E
