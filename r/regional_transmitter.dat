50|$|Jacaranda FM {{operates}} a <b>regional</b> <b>transmitter</b> split service from {{a studio in}} Nelspruit. It {{can be heard in}} most of the Capricorn, Bushveld and Lowveld regions of the Limpopo Province {{as well as in the}} Mpumalanga Lowveld, notably Nelspruit and the Kruger National Park. Split broadcasts occur each weekday from 12:00-16:00 and on Saturdays from 10:00-14:00. Morning and afternoon drive time newscasts are also fed to the regional audience.|$|E
50|$|The full {{independence}} of the Hungarian Post was declared in article XII of 1908. World War I, and the subsequent military occupations and revolutions, caused severe damage to the postal system, requiring a near complete rebuild. The first notable development was {{the opening of a}} 250 watt radio phone station in Csepel in 1923. The station's original task was to transmit news to the regional offices of the Hungarian news wire agency, but in empty air times music and songs were transmitted on an experimental basis, starting on 15 March 1924. From 1933 onwards, <b>regional</b> <b>transmitter</b> stations were opened, also upgrading the Csepel station to 120 kW (with a height of 314m).|$|E
25|$|In the UK, the {{switchover}} from analog {{to digital}} TV started on 17 October 2007 and was completed on 24 October 2012. Each group of <b>regional</b> <b>transmitters</b> had its analogue broadcasts switched {{off at a}} certain point between those dates.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 September 1939, the BBC merged the two {{programmes}} {{into one}} national service from London. The reasons given included {{the need to}} prevent enemy aircraft from using differentiated output from the <b>Regional</b> Programme's <b>transmitters</b> as navigational beacons. To this end, the former <b>regional</b> <b>transmitters</b> were synchronised in chains on (initially) two frequencies, 668 (South) and 767 kHz (North), with an additional chain of low-powered transmitters (known as [...] "Group H") on 1474 kHz appearing later. Under this arrangement regional broadcasting in its pre-war form was no longer feasible, {{but much of the}} programming was gradually decentralised to the former regional studios because of the risks from enemy attack/bombing/invasion in London, and broadcast nationally.|$|R
2500|$|In major cities, {{a number}} of brand new FM {{licences}} were issued in the 1990s and 2000s. All rural regions which traditionally had only one commercial station now {{have at least one}} AM and one FM commercial station. [...] In many cases, the owner of the original station now has at least two outlets. The number of <b>regional</b> <b>transmitters</b> for the ABC's five networks also increased dramatically during this era.|$|R
5000|$|The NZBC's {{microwave}} network between facilities {{was very much}} ad-hoc. Due to a shortage of microwave links, the network was completed by [...] "off air" [...] hops, where a 100 kW <b>regional</b> <b>transmitter</b> was received and re-transmitted by another. The network news {{was made possible by}} switching inputs to the regional transmitters, so that a signal could be relayed across the country. For instance, the Te Aroha <b>regional</b> <b>transmitter</b> for Hamilton could be switched away from Auckland programming to relay off-air, the Wellington signal coming up the country. Auckland then could see Wellington via Te Aroha. The non-synchronous switching was done manually initially and later with tone switching. During the network news presented from Wellington, if an inject was required from Auckland, Auckland would switch from transmitting Wellington pictures to transmitting, briefly a black screen with a small white [...] "A" [...] in the corner. Then each transmitter down the country would have to switch over so that the [...] "A" [...] would eventually appear in Wellington and beyond. Once all centres could see the [...] "A" [...] caption, the Auckland inject would be played. At the end of the item, the process would be reversed with a [...] "W" [...] for Wellington being switched sequentially, and then finally the Wellington presenter would appear again in all centres. The viewer would see a black non-synchronous switch which would take a second or so. Eagle-eyed viewers could see the identification letters change {{on the corner of the}} screen. Those with poor vertical hold would have to wait a little longer for the picture to stabilise. Occasionally, a transmitter would be switched out of sequence and the viewers would be treated to the sight of 100 kW of video feedback.|$|E

50|$|The first {{transmission}} to U.S. troops began at 5:45 p.m. July 4, 1943, and included {{less than five}} hours of recorded shows, a BBC news and sports broadcast. That day, Corporal Syl Binkin became the first U.S. military broadcaster heard over the air. The signal was sent from London via telephone lines to five <b>regional</b> <b>transmitters</b> to reach U.S. troops in the United Kingdom as they made preparations for the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe.|$|R
5000|$|... 1964 was {{the first}} year of a major {{restructuring}} exercise at RNE which was to see the establishment of a network of regional broadcasting centres equipped with powerful 250 to 500 kW mediumwave transmitters. These gave RNE full coverage of not just the national territory but a good part, too, of the rest of Europe (especially at night). The <b>regional</b> <b>transmitters</b> normally all broadcast the same signal, relayed from the main studios in Madrid, although provision was made for them to opt out at certain times of day and transmit regional news from their own local studios. This was the foundation of today's RNE Radio 1.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1980s the {{broadcast}} footprint was extended {{with the construction}} of the first of over 300 <b>regional</b> FM <b>transmitters</b> (including community re-broadcast sites). In 1985, the ABC renamed [...] "Radio 2" [...] as [...] "Radio National".|$|R
50|$|Since market {{aggregation}} in {{the early}} 1990s, each television broadcaster transmits its service using multiple relays in order provide the same service throughout Australia's large market areas. While each market is often divided into submarkets due to the legacy of previous commercial broadcasts (for example, Southern Cross Ten maintains two separate stations in the single Victoria market, GLV and BCV), {{the only difference between}} these submarkets in practice is limited to news services or local advertising. Except in major cities, all major television broadcasters use the same network of transmitters, which may have dozens of relay stations in each market. As a result, some areas have had trouble starting digital or HD services due to problems with certain <b>regional</b> <b>transmitters.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{tower was}} {{operated}} remotely from Portland, Oregon and {{was capable of}} sending telegraph message {{as far away as}} Asia and Europe. The eight smaller towers were 1500 ft from the central tower. Utilizing short-wave radio signals, the station would transmit point-to-point to <b>regional</b> <b>transmitters</b> such as in San Francisco, California or directly to ships at sea. On site was also a large concrete building 60 ft by 80 ft and 20 ft tall. In addition to this, on July 9, 1923, KEK began operation. The Marine receiving station was licensed to Hillsboro but was located in a building on Council Crest in Portland and the main office was in the Postal Building in downtown Portland. This downtown building is where all messages were received and relayed. The cables supporting the towers were one and one-quarter inch in diameter.|$|R
40|$|The {{elements}} of mathematical statistics, mathematical analysis, matrix theory, spectral analysis, discrete message transmission theory and mathematical modelling {{have been used}} for decision of the stated problems. The experimental data have been obtained of the laboratory mock-up in the real operation conditions of the <b>regional</b> <b>transmitters</b> and municipal a. f. rediffusion net. The suboptimum algorithms and structural circuits of dependent signal reception paths in the channels with absence and presence of MSI and also the methods of calculating weight coefficients of the transversal and recursive filters permitting to reduce sufficiently the computing consumptions in comparison with known algorithms have been proposed. The text radio broadcasting system in the commercial operation condition in St. -Petersburg has been developed and introduced on base of the investigated jamproof reception methods and algorithms.

50|$|A radio clock or {{radio-controlled}} clock (RCC) is a {{clock that}} is automatically synchronized by a time code transmitted by a radio transmitter {{connected to a}} time standard such as an atomic clock. Such a clock may be synchronized to the time sent by a single transmitter, such as many national or <b>regional</b> time <b>transmitters,</b> or may use multiple transmitters, like the Global Positioning System. Such systems {{may be used to}} automatically set clocks or for any purpose where accurate time is needed.|$|R
50|$|The local {{stations}} were gradually either converted to regional relays or closed entirely {{and replaced by}} high-power <b>Regional</b> Programme <b>transmitters.</b> Some local studios were retained to provide for programming from specific areas within each region. Most transmitters also carried the BBC National Programme on a local frequency to supplement the longwave broadcasts from 5XX, initially these were on three separate frequencies in order to minimise interference, but by 1939, as the Regional Programme network expanded, the National Programme's three remaining mediumwave transmitters - at Brookmans Park (for London and the South East), Moorside Edge (for The North), and Westerglen (for Central Scotland) - were all using 1149 kHz.|$|R
5000|$|Face TV (previously Triangle Television) is {{a public}} service {{television}} station based in Auckland, New Zealand. Since August 1998. It broadcasts on the Sky Network as of December 2013 ASO. Previously, Triangle has broadcast across Auckland on analogue UHF (before December 2013 ASO) via a government-owned UHF channel reserved for non-commercial <b>regional</b> television from <b>transmitters</b> at Waiatarua, Pinehill and Remuera.|$|R
50|$|After much {{procrastination}} on {{the part}} of various federal governments, FM broadcasting was eventually introduced in 1975. (There had been official experiments with FM broadcasting as far back as 1948.) Only a handful of radio stations were given new licences during the 1940s, 50s & 60s but, since 1975, many hundreds of new broadcasting licences have been issued on both the FM and AM bands. In the latter case, this was made possible by having 9 kHz between stations, rather 10 kHz breaks, as per the Geneva Frequency Plan. The installation of directional aerials also encouraged more AM stations. The type of station given FM licences reflects the policies and philosiphies of the various Australian governments. Initially, only the ABC and community radio stations were granted FM licences. However, after a change of government, commercial stations were permitted on the band, as from 1980. At first, one or two brand new stations were permitted in each major market. However, in 1990, one or two existing AM stations in each major market were given FM licences; the stations being chosen by an auction system. Apart from an initial settling-in period for those few stations transferred from AM to FM, there has been no simulcasting between AM and FM stations.In major cities, a number of brand new FM licences were issued in the 1990s and 2000s. All rural regions which traditionally had only one commercial station now have at least one AM and one FM commercial station. In many cases, the owner of the original station now has at least two outlets. The number of <b>regional</b> <b>transmitters</b> for the ABC's five networks also increased dramatically during this era.|$|R
40|$|Stem cell-derived neurons {{from various}} source {{materials}} present unique model systems {{to examine the}} fundamental properties of central nervous system (CNS) development {{as well as the}} molecular underpinnings of disease phenotypes. In order to more accurately assess potential therapies for neurological disorders, multiple strategies have been employed in recent years to produce neuronal populations that accurately represent in vivo <b>regional</b> and <b>transmitter</b> phenotypes. These include new technologies such as direct conversion of somatic cell types into neurons and glia which may accelerate maturation and retain genetic hallmarks of aging. In addition, novel forms of genetic manipulations have brought human stem cells nearly on par with those of rodent with respect to gene targeting. For neurons of the CNS, the ultimate phenotypic characterization lies with their ability to recapitulate functional properties such as passive and active membrane characteristics, synaptic activity, and plasticity. These features critically depend on the coordinated expression and localization of hundreds of ion channels and receptors, as well as scaffolding and signaling molecules. In this review I will highlight the current state of knowledge regarding functional properties of human stem cell-derived neurons, with a primary focus on pluripotent stem cells. While significant advances have been made, critical hurdles must be overcome in order for this technology to support progression toward clinical applications...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{considerable}} contrast between the various functions assigned to Broca’s region and its relatively simple subdivision into two cytoarchitectonic areas (44 and 45). Since the <b>regional</b> distribution of <b>transmitter</b> receptors in the cerebral cortex has been proven a powerful indicator of functional diversity, the subdivision of Broca’s region was analyzed here using a multireceptor approach. The distribution patterns of six receptor types using in vitro receptor autoradiography revealed previously unknown areas: a ventral precentral transitional cortex 6 r 1, dorsal and ventral areas 44 d and 44 v, anterior and posterior areas 45 a and 45 p, and areas op 8 and op 9 in the frontal operculum. A significant lateralization of receptors was demonstrated {{with respect to the}} cholinergic M 2 receptor, particularly in area 44 v+d. We propose a new concept of the anterior language region, which elucidates the relation between premotor cortex, prefrontal cortex, and Broca’s region. It offers human brain homologues to the recently described subdivision of area 45, and the segregation of the ventral premotor cortex in macaque brains. The results provide a novel structural basis of the organization of language regions in the brain...|$|R
40|$|The {{currently}} available architectonic {{maps of the}} human cerebral cortex do not match {{the high degree of}} cortical segregation as shown by functional imaging. Such functional imaging studies have demonstrated a considerable number of functionally specialized areas not displayed in the architectonic maps. We therefore analysed the regional and laminar distribution of various transmitter receptors in the human cerebral cortex, because these signalling molecules {{play a crucial role in}} cortical functions. They may provide a novel and functionally more relevant insight into the regional organization of the cortex, which cannot be achieved by architectonic observations in cell body- or myelin-stained sections. Serial cryostat sections through whole human hemispheres were used for quantitative receptor autoradiography. The regional and laminar densities of numerous receptors of classic transmitter systems were analysed. Alternating sections were stained for comparisons based on cyto- or myeloarchitectonic criteria. Our results demonstrate that the <b>regional</b> distribution of <b>transmitter</b> receptors reflects well-established cyto- and myeloarchitectonically defined borders of cortical areas, but in addition enables the identification of more cortical areas than previously demonstrated. Moreover, the laminar distribution patterns of a given receptor type in different cortical areas as well as those of different receptor types in the same cortical area reveal novel and functionally relevant data concerning the intracortical organization in the human cerebral cortex...|$|R
