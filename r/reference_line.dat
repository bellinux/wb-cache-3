25|$|The log-polar {{coordinate}} system represents {{a point in}} the plane by the logarithm of the distance from the origin and an angle measured from a <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> intersecting the origin.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{the plane}} was {{described}} in a so-called Cartesian coordinate system, a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane {{by a pair of}} numerical coordinates, which are the signed distances from the point to two fixed perpendicular directed lines, measured in the same unit of length. Each <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> is called a coordinate axis or just axis of the system, and the point where they meet is its origin, usually at ordered pair (0, 0). The coordinates can also be defined as the positions of the perpendicular projections of the point onto the two axes, expressed as signed distances from the origin.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a comprehensive review}} of state of practice in construction quantity takeoff, quality control, and site safety monitoring, and recent research efforts on evaluating photogrammetric error sources and their impact on modeling for construction surveying related applications. In addition, this paper conducted experiments to characterize the behavior of fixing full-scale photogrammetric models in construction applications. In this experiment, factors including relative position of the <b>reference</b> <b>lines,</b> number of <b>reference</b> <b>lines,</b> and spatial relationships of the <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> were considered. The surveying results were then compared with ground truth data, which allows for accuracy determination and aids in determining the best strategy in selecting <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> for scale fixing. The review and the experimental findings may help construction professionals better understand the performance of the photogrammetry technology and apply it in their real-world projects.|$|R

2500|$|Rather {{than using}} the Wiberg angle {{because it makes}} it {{difficult}} to quantify the degree of dislocation they used 3 key elements to determine the degree of subluxation: A <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> at the lower rim of the [...] "teardrop", junction between the femoral head and neck of the respective joint and the height of the pelvis (vertical measurement). They studied anteroposterior pelvic x-rays and drew horizontal lines through the lower rim of a feature called [...] "teardrop". The distance between this line and the middle lines of the junction between femur head and neck gave them a measure of the degree of femur head subluxation. They further established that a [...] "normal" [...] diameter of the femur head measures 20% of the height of the pelvis. [...] If the middle line of the neck-head junction was more than 10% of the pelvis height above the <b>reference</b> <b>line</b> they considered the joint to be more than 50% dislocated.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of mental fatigue and additional corridor and pitch sector lines on players' physical and tactical performances during soccer small-sided games. Twelve youth players performed four Gk+ 6 vs 6 +Gk small-sided games. Prior to the game, one team performed a motor coordination task to induce mental fatigue, while the other one performed a control task. A repeated measures design allowed to compare players' performances across four conditions: (a) with mental fatigue against opponents without mental fatigue in a normal pitch (MEN), (b) with mental fatigue on a pitch with additional <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> (#MEN); (c) without mental fatigue against mentally fatigued opponents on a normal pitch (CTR); and (d) without mental fatigue on a pitch with <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> (#CTR). Player's physical performance was assessed by the distance covered per minute and the number of accelerations and decelerations (0. 5 – 3. 0 m/s 2; > − 3. 0 m/s 2). Positional data was used to determine individual (spatial exploration index, time synchronized in longitudinal and lateral directions) and team-related variables (length, width, speed of dispersion and contraction). Unclear effects were found for the physical activity measures in most of the conditions. There was a small decrease in time spent laterally synchronized and a moderate decrease in the contraction speed when MEN compared to the CTR. Also, there was a small decrease in the time spent longitudinally synchronized during the #MEN condition compared to MEN. The results showed that mental fatigue affects the ability to use environmental information and players' positioning, while the additional <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> may have enhanced the use of less relevant information to guide their actions during the #MEN condition. Overall, coaches could manipulate the mental fatigue and <b>reference</b> <b>lines</b> to induce variability and adaptation in young soccer players' behavior...|$|R
