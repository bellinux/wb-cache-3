25|$|The 'calcine' {{generated}} is fed continuously into an induction heated furnace with fragmented glass. The resulting {{glass is}} a new substance in which the waste products are bonded into the glass matrix when it solidifies. As a melt, this product is poured into stainless steel cylindrical containers ("cylinders") in a batch process. When cooled, the fluid solidifies ("vitrifies") into the glass. After being formed, the glass is highly <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{time passed}} and the method moved more into the {{mainstream}} some disagreement arose as to {{the problems associated with}} cutting off air to skin contact, and also some improvements were made. Eventually Pirogov's method gave way to Mathijsen's. Among the improvements suggested as early as 1860 was that of making the dressing <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> by painting the dried plaster of Paris with a mixture of shellac dissolved in alcohol. The first commercial bandages were not produced until 1931 in Germany, and were called Cellona. Before that the bandages were made by hand at the hospitals.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{limitations}} of plaster of Paris, surgeons have also experimented {{with other types of}} materials for use as splints. An early plastic like material was gutta-percha obtained from the latex of trees found in Malaya. It resembled rubber, but contained more resins. When dry it was hard and inelastic, but when warmed it became soft and malleable. In 1851 Utterhoeven, described the use of splints made from this material for the treatment of fractures. In the 1970s, the development of fibreglass casting tape made it possible to produce a cast that was lighter and more durable than the traditional plaster cast and also <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> (although the bandages underneath were not) allowing the patient to be more active.|$|E
2500|$|Bullet pullers {{are also}} used to {{disassemble}} loaded ammunition of questionable provenance or undesirable configuration, so that the components can be salvaged for re-use. [...] Surplus military ammunition is often pulled for components, particularly the cartridge cases, which are often difficult to obtain for older foreign military rifles. [...] Military ammunition is often tightly sealed, to make it <b>resistant</b> <b>to</b> <b>water</b> and rough handling, such as in machine gun feeding mechanisms. [...] In this case, the seal between the bullet and cartridge can prevent the bullet puller from functioning. [...] Pushing the bullet into the case slightly with a seating die will break the seal, and allow the bullet to be pulled.|$|E
