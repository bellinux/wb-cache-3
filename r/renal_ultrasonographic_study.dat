40|$|Se presenta un paciente del sexo masculino, negro, de 13 años de edad, con diagnóstico de pseudoxantoma elástico. En el estudio ultrasonográfico renal y {{testicular}} se observaron imágenes ecorrefringentes en los riñones y testículos, que no emiten sombra acústica ni demuestran alteraciones de la función renal o del sedimento urinario. No se recogieron antecedentes familiares de lesiones cutáneas que hagan recordar la enfermedad. Estos hallazgos, tanto los renales como los testiculares, se han documentado en la literatura médica, por lo que estimamos que su divulgación es interesante, pues se ha planteado que forman parte del fenotipo de la enfermedad.

40|$|Backgrounds and {{objectives}} This report describes six patients with AKI stages 2 – 3 (median admission creatinine level, 2. 75 mg/dl [range, 1. 58 – 5. 44 mg/dl]), hematuria (five with hemoproteinuria), and unremarkable imaging {{with an unusual}} and unexplained histologic diagnosis on renal biopsy. Design, setting, participants, &measurements The patients were young adults who presented to two neighboring United Kingdom nephrology centers over a 40 -month period (between July 2010 and November 2013). Four were male, and the median age was 22. 5 years (range, 18 – 27 years). Their principal symptomswere flank pain or lower back pain. All had consumed alcohol {{in the days leading}} up to admission. Results Renal biopsy demonstrated microthrombi in the renal arcuate veins with a corresponding stereotypical, localized inflammatory infiltrate at the corticomedullary junction. All patients recovered to baseline renal function with supportive care (median, 17 days; range, 6 – 60 days), and none required RRT. To date, additional investigations have not revealed an underlying cause for these histopathologic changes. Investigations have included screening for thrombophilic tendencies, <b>renal</b> vein Doppler <b>ultrasonographic</b> <b>studies,</b> and testing for recreational drugs and alcohol (including liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry of urine) to look for so-called designer drugs. Inquiries to the United Kingdom National Poisons Information Centre have identified no other cases with similar presentation or histologic findings. Conclusions Increased awareness and additional study of future cases may lead to a greater understanding of the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms that caused AKI in these patients...|$|R

40|$|Today, bile {{stones are}} {{increasingly}} common in children. Hemolytic disorders and ceftriaxone use are commonly implicated as risk factors, although {{approximately half of}} the cases are idiopathic.

Physical examination, laboratory and hormonal measurements, <b>ultrasonographic</b> <b>study</b> of body fat distribution, ECG and ECHOc study were performed before during and after 34 days of TF and after 17 days of isocaloric re-feeding. The subject was a 52 -year old Caucasian who was overweight with increased abdominal fat content (BMI: 28. 6; W/H ratio: 0. 95) and increased levels of arterial systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP). HPLC measurements of urinary catecholamine levels (HPLC), ECHOc study of cardiac performance, <b>ultrasonographic</b> <b>study</b> of body fat distribution were performed. The subject starved for 34 days losing 22 kg, but after that time he was compelled to re-feed because of nausea and severe vomiting. A marked ketosis (ketonuria > 1200 mg/day) was already present after 6 days of TF. After 17 days of TF norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) urinary levels showed a two-fold and nine-fold increase respectively, but they became undetectable at the end of TF. After 17 days of re-feeding catecholamine urinary levels were similar to those measured after 17 days of TF. After both TF and 17 -day isocaloric re-feeding we found a decrease of visceral fat content and W/H ratio reached the normal values for age-matched subjects (W/H ratio after TF: 0. 80, after re-feeding: 0. 80) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{economic}} crisis, {{the growing}} healthcare demand, and Defensive Medicine wastefulness, strongly recommend {{the restructuring of}} the entire medical network. New health technology, such as bedside ultrasonography, might successfully integrate the clinical approach optimizing the use of limited resources, especially in a person-oriented vision of medicine. Bedside ultrasonography is a safe and reliable technique, with worldwide expanding employment in various clinical settings, being considered as "the stethoscope of the 21 st century". However, at present, bedside ultrasonography lacks economic analysis. We performed a Cost-Benefit Analysis "ex ante", with a break-even point computing, of bedside ultrasonography implementation in an Internal Medicine department in the mid-term. Number and kind estimation of bedside <b>ultrasonographic</b> <b>studies</b> were obtained by a retrospective study, whose data results were applied to the next 3 -year period (foresight study). All 1980 foreseen bedside examinations, with prevailing multiorgan <b>ultrasonographic</b> <b>studies,</b> were considered to calculate direct and indirect costs, while specific and generic revenues were considered only after the first semester. Physician professional training, equipment purchase and working time represented the main fixed and variable cost items. DRG increase/appropriateness, hospitalization stay shortening and reduction of traditional ultrasonography examination requests mainly impacted on calculated revenues. The break-even point, i. e. the volume of activity at which revenues exactly equal total incurred costs, was calculated to be 734 US examinations, corresponding to € 81, 998 and the time considered necessary to reach it resulting 406  days.

The <b>ultrasonographic</b> <b>study</b> demonstrated multiple hypoechoic areas in the testes and normal epididymis. Since the lesion was presumed as malignancy, bilateral inguinal exploration was performed and intraoperative frozen biopsies were studied and diagnosed as inflammatory process. Nevertheless, we decided to perform left orchiectomy to a deeper histopathologic analysis which revealed granulomatous orchitis, mastocytosis, and severe depletion of Leydig cells at the testicular interstitium. Differential diagnosis between testicular tumor and granulomatous orchitis is very difficult in any examination except by histological findings. Bilateral cases of this pathology are relatively rare, but {{it is necessary to}} distinguish them from the testicular tumor before surgical intervention to avoid an unnecessary orchiectomy...|$|R

40|$|Milk {{of calcium}} renal stone" (liquid renal calculosis) is a quite {{uncommon}} lithiasis distinguished {{by the presence}} of a semiliquid suspension of calcium salts or a "seed-like" sediment in a caliceal diverticulum or an ectasia segment of the collecting system. We reviewed 5 patients (1 male and 4 females, mean age 48. 6 years), with a history of urinary tract infection, renal pain or haematuria. All patients underwent <b>renal</b> <b>ultrasonographic</b> assessment in both clinostatic and orthostatic position. Three patients underwent intravenous pyelography before ultrasound. Ultrasonography showed a sonolucent "levelled" image with a posterior acoustic shadow inside a hydro-caliceal dilation (2 pts.) or caliceal diverticulum (3 pts.); the persistence of the "level" in both clinostatic and orthostatic position allowed an immediate diagnosis in all patients. Intravenous pyelography performed before renal ultrasound showed no abnormality in 1 patient and was misleading in two; it otherwise confirmed the diagnosis when performed after renal ultrasonography. Three patients underwent surgery, two patients refused therapy; sonographic follow-up showed no evolution of the morphologic picture. Once considered as exceptional, liquid renal calculosis still remains rare pathology and accounts for 0. 6 % of all the urinary lithiasis diagnosed by ultrasound in our series. An accurate sonographic assessment allows a reliable diagnosis of this particular lithiasis and an easy discrimination from solid lithiasis, nephrocalcinosis, medullary sponge kidney and hydropyonephrosis.
