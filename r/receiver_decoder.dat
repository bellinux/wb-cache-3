50|$|Interactive {{television}} {{represents a}} continuum from low (TV on/off, volume, changing channels) to moderate interactivity (simple movies on demand without player controls) and high interactivity in which, for example, an audience member affects the program being watched. The most obvious {{example of this}} would be any kind of real-time voting on the screen, in which audience votes create decisions that are reflected in how the show continues. A return path to the program provider is not necessary to have an interactive program experience. Once a movie is downloaded for example, controls may all be local. The link was needed to download the program, but texts and software which can be executed locally at the set-top box or IRD (Integrated <b>Receiver</b> <b>Decoder)</b> may occur automatically, once the viewer enters the channel.|$|E

30|$|Network {{source coding}} expands the data {{compression}} problem for networks beyond the point-to-point network introduced by Shannon [5]. These include networks with multiple transmitters, multiple <b>receivers,</b> <b>decoder</b> side information, intermediate nodes, and {{any combination of}} these features. Thus, network source coding attempts {{to bridge the gap}} between point-to-point network and recent complicated network environments. Network source coding is a promising technique that provides many advantages, including source dependence, functional demands, and resource sharing [6 – 12]. By utilizing network source coding, the system performance can be improved by using correlated sources. This leads to an adjustable transmission rate, and the input data streams share the entire network resource during the transmission. If decoders have the information about the relation of transmitted data sources, the input data sources can be reconstructed without any loss in the noiseless channel.|$|R
50|$|The {{transponder}} receives coded {{or single}} pulse interrogation from ground stations and transmits a single-pulse reply {{in the same}} frequency band. A common antenna is used for receiving and transmitting. The transponder consists of five functional systems: superheterodyne <b>receiver,</b> <b>decoder,</b> modulator, transmitter, and power supply. The duplexer (a 4-port ferromagnetic circulator) provides isolation between receiver and transmitter. Interrogating pulses are directed from the antenna to the receiver, and reply pulses are directed from the transmitter to the antenna. The preselector, consisting of three coaxial cavities, attenuates all RF signals outside the receiving band. The received signal is heterodyned to a 50 MHz intermediate frequency in the mixer and amplified in the IF amplifier which also contains the detector. In case of coded transmission, the decoder module provides a pulse output only if the correct spacing exists between pulse pairs received. The shaped-pulse output of the decoder is directed to the modulator which converts it into a high-power, precisely shaped and precisely delayed pulse which {{is applied to the}} magnetron to produce the reply pulse. Six telemetry outputs are provided: input signal level, input pulse repetition frequency (PRF), temperature, incident power, reflected power, and reply PRF.|$|E

The communication process is defined as involving an exchange of meaning between the sender (Encoder) of a message and the <b>receiver</b> (<b>Decoder).</b> In three studies, researchers set out to identify personality traits common to culturally different groups and to describe relationships between them and the dominant society. Bases of difference include different value systems and attitudes springing from social, economic and other forces operating in the environment.

40|$|DVB-T 2 (digital video {{broadcasting}} - {{second generation}} terrestrial) is considered {{as the most}} advanced digital terrestrial television system.

40|$|In {{streaming}} video applications, video sequences are encoded off-line {{and stored in}} a server. Users may access the server over a constant bit-rate channel such as Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) or Integrated Service Digital Network (ISDN). Examples of the {{streaming video}} are video on demand, archived video news, and non-interactive distance learning. Before the playback, part of the video bit-stream is pre-loaded in the decoder buffer to ensure that every frame can be decoded at the scheduled time. For these streaming video applications, since the delay (latency) is not a critical issue and the whole video sequence is available to the encoder, a more sophisticated bit-allocation scheme {{can be used to}} achieve better video quality. During the encoding process for streaming video, two constraints need to be considered: the maximum preloading time that the video viewers are willing to accept and the physical buffer-size at the <b>receiver</b> (<b>decoder)</b> side.

Both schemes embed a low-resolution version of the picture or video frame into the original video content using a spread-spectrum watermarking technique. At the <b>receiver</b> side (<b>decoder),</b> the embedded watermark is extracted from the received video frame and {{is used as a}} reference for reconstructing the original signal.

40|$|Abstract: Diseases in the {{gastro-intestinal}} tract are on {{an increasing}} trend. In order to diagnose a patient, various signals of the digestive organ, such as temperature, pH, and pressure, can offer the helpful information. Among the above mentioned signals, we choose the pressure variation as a monitoring signal. The variation of a pressure signal of the gastro-intestinal tract can offer the information of a digestive trouble or some clues of the diseases. In this paper, a pressure monitoring {{system for the}} digestive organs of a living pig is presented. This is why a pig’s gastro-intestinal tract is very similar as human’s. This system concept is to transmit the measured biomedical signals from a transmitter in a living pig to a wireless receiver that is positioned out of body. The integrated solution includes the swallow type pressure capsule and the receiving set consisting of a <b>receiver,</b> <b>decoder</b> circuit. The merit of the proposed system is that the monitoring system can supply the precise and a durable characteristic to measure and to transmit a signal in the gastro-intestinal tract.

Through various experiments, we found each organ has its own characterized pressure fluctuation...|$|E
40|$|In densely {{deployed}} wireless networks (e. g. sensor networks), the inter-node distances can be {{very small}} (< 10 m). In such a setting, {{it has been observed}} that the power consumption of the transceiver circuitry is of the same order or even dominates the required signal transmission power. Such observations have motivated recent work that considers settings to minimize the power consumption of the transmitter, while considering both transmitter circuit and signal energy. However, for many communication links, such as those employing turbo codes or sequentially-decoded convolutional codes, the power consumption of the decoder at the receiver depends on the received signal power and hence on the transmitted signal power. By transmitting a signal at a power higher than the minimum required for successful reception, the transmitter can reduce the receiver decoding effort, thereby often reducing the overall power consumption on the link. This paper develops the required optimization framework to consider this tradeoff. Using such a framework, it is demonstrated that the ability to trade transmitted RF power for <b>receiver</b> <b>decoder</b> power can result in significant improvements in overall energy consumption or network lifetime versus schemes that always employ the minimum power required for successful transmission. The gains are particularly pronounced in wireless networks with asymmetric power costs. ...|$|E

Viterbi Decoder is very commonly implemented technique among the various error detection and correction (EDAC) techniques. A high data-rate convolutional code suffers from decrease in the performance of bit-error-rate due to inherent drifting error between the estimated and the accurate path matric and the optimal path matric calculation during the trellis generation. The design performance is highly dependent on many factors like availability of memory elements, decoding latency of the circuit, overhead bits in the algorithm, etc. In this paper, we propose a design of Convolutional Viterbi Rate- 1 / 3 Encoder and Decoder for a wireless communication system based on IEEE 802. 11 n Draft.
