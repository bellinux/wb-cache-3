5|$|Shortly {{after making}} {{the choice to}} include {{electronic}} drums and triggers, Peart added what has become another trademark of his kit: a rotating drum <b>riser.</b> During live Rush shows the <b>riser</b> allows Peart to swap the prominent portions of the kit (traditional acoustic in front, electronic in back). A staple of Peart's live drum solos has been the in-performance rotation-and-swap of {{the front and back}} kits as part of the solo itself. This special effect provides both a symbolic transition of drum styles within the solo and a visual treat for the audience.|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} of seawater {{in a sea}} outfall can reduce the effluent discharge from a land-based treatment plant or domestic and industrial areas. In the longterm, it can damage the sea outfall. To avoid the {{presence of}} seawater and to anticipate a varying effluent discharge, a minimum effluent discharge is needed to purge the outfall system. [...] The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate various ways of decreasing the minimum effluent discharge needed to purge a sea outfall. The effect of port size and an increase in mixing between saltwater and effluent are considered in this study. In tests on the effect of port size, three different types of tests were undertaken. There included <b>risers</b> without caps, <b>risers</b> with caps having one port of diameter 2. 54 cm (one inch), and <b>risers</b> with caps having two ports of diameter 2. 54 cm (one inch). Attempts were made to increase mixing in the vertical <b>risers</b> using small water jets located below the <b>risers,</b> water jets located upstream of the <b>risers,</b> air jets located below the <b>risers</b> and a barrier located at the top of tunnel upstream the <b>risers.</b> [...] The maximum reduction in the purging discharge was obtained using water jets (1. 001 /min) located below all <b>risers.</b> The purging discharge using these jets was only 48 % of that without water jets.

They enjoyed how Messiah <b>Riser</b> was different from other Japanese role-playing games, but found the user interface hard to use and that the artificial intelligence felt erratic; they also commented on how demons only have one magic attack each made the game feel limiting.

5|$|NuScale {{designs and}} markets small modular nuclear {{reactors}} that the Department of Energy {{expects to be}} commercially available around 2025. Its designs use the light water approach to cooling and power generation that is common in conventional nuclear plants. Water is heated by the nuclear core {{at the base of}} the reactor vessel. Heated water flows upwards inside the <b>riser,</b> then down over steam generators. As heat is transferred to steam generators, the water becomes cooler and denser, sinking back to the bottom of the device, where the cycle is repeated. Heat transferred to the steam generators is used to create steam that turns a turbine, which drives an electrical generator.|$|E

Inspired by the loud, raw sound of his live performances, Saadiq worked with recording engineer and long-time collaborator Charles Brungardt to produce a grittier, more aggressive sound than on his previous records. Most of the instruments played on the album were performed by Saadiq, {{and with the help}} of arranger Paul <b>Riser</b> and engineer Gerry Brown, he incorporated string and orchestral arrangements to the songs.|$|E

It revolves around the journey of a young Forerunner, Bornstellar, and two humans, Chakas and Morning <b>Riser,</b> and how their lives change when they meet a Forerunner warrior, the Didact. The Forerunners are a type-three civilization on the Kardashev scale; they can build artificial planets and control stars. Forerunners are divided into classes by occupation, they are (in order of rank): Builders, the architects of the Forerunners' megastructures, Miners, Lifeworkers, experts in medicine and biology, and Warriors. Bornstellar's family are politically important Builders and particularly wealthy, enabling them to own an entire planet. Warriors introduced in this book called Prometheans were later featured as antagonists in the video game Halo 4.|$|E

When the interrogation was over, his monitor body shut down and was launched into space, but his mind remained in the ship, informing the crew {{that he was going to}} search for the Librarian and restore his friends <b>Riser</b> and Vinnerva from his life as Chakas before placing the crew in cryostasis and taking the ship for his own to search for the Forerunner.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the video features Jay Z as a passenger in a car speeding along Mission Road in Los Angeles, where he encounters Beyoncé, {{standing in the middle}} of the road, at the Fourth Street bridge. Beyoncé performs in various dance sequences, beginning with her wearing a white tank top, denim blue shorts, and red high-heels. She performs an elaborate solo dance on a <b>riser.</b> The scene shifts to a gold set with a mock photo shoot, before moving into a scene with dancers detailing Beyoncé and dancing against a wall while wearing caps and full length pants. Jay Z appears and ignites a line of petrol leading to a car parked under the bridge, which explodes in flames. Jay Z performs his rap in front of the burning car, and Beyoncé dances beside him, wearing an exotic silk print over a fur coat, before kicking the valve off a fire hydrant. She continues to dance while the water is flying everywhere. The video ends with Beyoncé and her dancers wearing vibrant Versace dresses in front of a large fan. Their outfits contrast with the neutral colors of the background, the video. Carmit Bachar, a former Pussycat Dolls singer, is one of the dancers.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} Mac Pro's {{main memory}} uses 667MHz DDR2 ECC FB-DIMMs; the early 2008 model uses 800MHz ECC DDR2 FB-DIMMS, the 2009 and onward Mac Pro use 1066MHz DDR3 ECC DIMMs {{for the standard}} models, and 1333MHz DDR3 ECC DIMMs for systems configured with 2.66GHz or faster CPUs. In the original and 2008 models, these modules are installed in pairs, one each on two <b>riser</b> cards. The cards have 4 DIMM slots each, allowing a total of 32GB of memory (8 × 4GB) to be installed. Notably, due to its FB-DIMM architecture, installing more RAM in the Mac Pro will improve its memory bandwidth, but may also increase its memory latency. With a simple installation of a single FB-DIMM, the peak bandwidth is 8GB/s, but this can increase to 16GB/s by installing two FB-DIMMs, one {{on each of the}} two buses, which is the default configuration from Apple. While electrically the FB-DIMMs are standard, for pre-2009 Mac Pro models Apple specifies larger-than-normal heatsinks on the memory modules. Problems have been reported by users who have used third party RAM with normal size FB-DIMM heatsinks. (see notes below). 2009 and later Mac Pro computers do not require memory modules with heatsinks.|$|E

40|$|The British Antarctic Survey VLF {{database}} from Halley (L = 4. 3) and Faraday (L = 2. 3) stations, Antarctica, {{has been}} searched for clear examples of whistler-triggered emissions (WTEs). Dominant events were the triggering of <b>risers</b> or quasi-constant frequency emissions {{from the upper}} arm of a whistler. A fairly frequent occurrence was the triggering of steep fallers from the whistler upper arm. At Faraday most WTE events were the triggering of long steep <b>risers</b> from the lower whistler arm. A VHS/VLF Vlasov hybrid simulation code was run and successfully simulated the main categories of WTE: <b>risers</b> and fallers off the upper arm and <b>risers</b> from the lower arm. Agreement with observations was generally very good, although {{in the case of}} triggered fallers and <b>risers</b> from the lower arm, very high frequency sweep rates were not obtained.
