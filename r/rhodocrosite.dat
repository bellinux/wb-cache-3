5000|$|Triplite {{is a rare}} {{phosphate}} mineral with formula: [...] It {{occurs in}} phosphate-rich granitic pegmatites typically as irregular brown opaque masses. Triplite was first described in 1813 for an occurrence in Chanteloube, Limousin, France. The name is from the Greek triplos for triple, {{in reference to the}} three cleavage directions. [...] In color and appearance, it is very similar to <b>rhodocrosite,</b> another manganese bearing mineral. Chemically, it is also quite similar to triploidite the difference being that triplite is fluorine dominant while triploidite is hydroxide dominant.|$|E
40|$|Manganese redox {{chemistry}} {{plays an}} important role in Mn uptake by plants, ecotoxicology of trace elements associated with Mn-oxides, and the etiology of some soil-borne fungal diseases. Manganese solubility (and hence bioavailability) is closely related to oxidation state, but direct measurement of Mn oxidation state has been difficult. We used X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy to determine the relative proportions of Mn(II), Mn(III) and Mn(IV) in moist soils, and correlated this with Mn solubility obtained from a sequential extraction procedure that consisted of: (1) 1 M pH 7 NH 4 OAc, (2) 0. 5 M pH 2. 9 CuSO 4 or 1 M pH 3 NH 4 OAc, (3) 0. 018 M quinol in 1 M pH 7 NH 4 OAc, and (4) dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate (DCB). We followed changes in Mn oxidation state and solubility upon microbial reduction and subsequent re-oxidation using 4 Indiana surface soils with total Mn contents of 300 – 1050 mg kg− 1 and pHs of 5. 7 – 6. 8. In moist, aerated soil, most of the Mn was present as Mn(IV) and XANES spectroscopy tracked the progressive removal of Mn(IV) by increasingly aggressive extractants. There is evidence that lowering the pH from 7 to 3 resulted in solid state reduction of Mn(IV) to Mn(III) within the soil Mn-oxide minerals without release of appreciable Mn to solution. After a 7 -day microbial reduction treatment, most of the Mn occurred as Mn(II). About 2 / 3 of this Mn(II) was extracted by pH 7 NH 4 -acetate, but the remaining 1 / 3 was extracted by pH 3 NH 4 -acetate. The XANES spectra suggest that this acid soluble Mn(II) phase is not <b>rhodocrosite</b> (MnCO 3) as predicted by thermodynamic calculations, but its exact form, whether as a solid solution in calcite ((Ca, Mn) CO 3), as an Mn(II) -phosphate phase, or as some other solid, still remains to be determined. In both aerated and reduced soils, XANES spectroscopy showed that a considerable fraction of the total Mn occurred as Mn(III), presumably incorporated into the structure of iron oxide or phyllosilicate clay minerals. Re-oxidation of Mn(II) following drying of waterlogged soil was found to be primarily a microbially mediated process. ...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{concentrations}} of 238 U and δ 234 U values were determined in estuarine surface waters and pore {{waters of the}} Amazon and Fly (Papua New Guinea) Rivers to investigate U transport phenomena across river-dominated land-sea margins. Discharge from large, tropical rivers is {{a major source of}} dissolved and solid materials transported to the oceans, and are important in defining not only oceanic mass budgets, but also terrestrial weathering rates. On the Amazon shelf, salinity-property plots of dissolved organic carbon, pH and total suspended matter revealed two vastly contrasting water masses that were energetically mixed. In this mixing zone, the distribution of uranium was highly non-conservative and exhibited extensive removal from the water column. Uranium removal was most pronounced within a salinity range of 0 - 16. 6, and likely the result of scavenging and flocculation reactions with inorganic (i. e., Fe/Mn oxides) and organic colloids/particles. Removal of uranium may also be closely coupled to exchange and resuspension processes at the sediment/water interface. An inner-shelf pore water profile indicated the following diagenetic processes: extensive (∼ 1 m) zones of Fe(III) - and, to a lesser degree, Mn(IV) - reduction in the absence of significant S(II) concentrations appeared to facilitate the formation of various authigenic minerals (e. g., siderite, <b>rhodocrosite</b> and uraninite). The pore water dissolved 238 U profile co-varied closely with Mn(II). Isotopic variations as evidenced in δ 234 U pore waters values from this site revealed information on the origin and history of particulate uranium. Only after a depth of about 1 m did the δ 234 U value approach unity (secular equilibrium), denoting a residual lattice bound uranium complex that is likely an upper-drainage basin weathering product. This suggests that the enriched δ 234 U values represent a riverine surface complexation product that is actively involved in Mn-Fe diagenetic cycles and surface complexation reactions. In the Fly River estuary, 238 U appears to exhibit a reasonably conservative distribution as a function of salinity. The absence of observed U removal does not necessarily imply non-reactivity, but instead may record an integration of concurrent U removal and release processes. There is not a linear correlation between δ 234 U vs. 1 / 238 U that would imply simple two component mixing. It is likely that resuspension of bottom sediments, prolonged residence times in the lower reaches of the Fly River, and energetic particle-colloid interactions contribute to the observed estuarine U distribution. The supply of uranium discharged from humid, tropical river systems to the sea appears to be foremost influenced by particle/water interactions that are ultimately governed by the particular physiographic and hydrologic characteristics of an estuary. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a literature review {{of soil and}} sediment inundation methodologies and describes a pilot scale laboratory inundation study. Changing weather conditions, subsequent flooding events, and the increased frequency of such events both in the UK and worldwide is highlighting the need to research the area of contaminant mobility from soils and sediments under inundated conditions. The findings of such investigations impact {{on a wide variety}} of sectors, including human and ecological health, agriculture, building, transport, world economy and climate change. Standardised methodologies for the investigation of contaminant mobility resulting from soil/sediment inundation episodes are not available. Most research has been conducted in the agricultural sector for nutrient transport, as part of soil fertility and plant nutrition studies. Only recently has work been undertaken for studying potentially harmful element transport in inundated sediments/soils. A pilot scale laboratory study was undertaken using contaminated bank sediment samples collected from the Rookhope Burn catchment, Northern England, UK, with the aim to examine the extent of contaminant mobilisation from flooded sediments. The catchment has been affected by historical mining and processing of lead and zinc ore and is representative of several catchments affected by the environmental legacy related to mining in the Northern Pennine Orefield. Bank sediment Pb and Zn concentrations were found significantly above both the TEL and PEL sediment quality criteria, posing potentially a significant hazard to aquatic organisms. The source of the Pb and Zn in the sediments is related to the underlying mineralisation, mining activities and mine water discharges in the catchment. Abundances of original sulphide ore and authigenic metal-bearing phases were expected to vary through the catchment. The study design simulated rising flood water, a slow saturation of the sediment in order to induce a slow change in physico-chemical properties, followed by a 3 month (88 day) stagnation period. Natural day-night cycles were simulated by undertaking the study on the bench top during the winter of 2009 / 2010 (November to February). The chemical changes in the inundation water during the experiment were monitored and the sediment pore water at the end of the inundation period analysed. The inundation water pH remained alkaline to neutral, while redox measurements indicated oxic conditions in the water column throughout the inundation period. The pilot study showed that inundation of river bank sediments from the Rookhope Burn may be a significant pathway for contaminants in the catchment and that mobilisation from the sediments may pose a hazard to environmental receptors in the area, particularly with respect to Pb and Zn contamination. The different degrees and different rates of metal losses to the overlying water column observed during the flooding of the Rookhope Burn bank sediments demonstrated that the significance of metal mobilisation was dictated by the sediment composition. The inundation water composition monitored during the sediment flooding was used to indirectly infer possible processes that control contaminant fluxes from the sediments to the overlying water. Dissolved Pb concentration in the inundation water reflected the original concentration in the solid material and in sediments that had XRD-detectable galena and cerussite the dissolved Pb concentration reached a maximum value of 395 μg l- 1. Cerussite, which is commonly formed as coatings on galena during the sulphide weathering, was close or supersaturated in those solutions, suggesting that the lead carbonate mineral phase provided a continuous source of Pb to these solutions. The initial dissolved Zn in the inundation waters was independent of the original concentration in the sediments. Sediments downstream a mine water discharge showed a greater availability of easily mobilised Zn, producing high initial Zn concentration in the inundation water, despite the relatively low Zn concentration in the inundated sediment. The Zn/SO 4 and Cd/Zn molar ratios were both consistent with sphalerite mineral oxidation. The final inundation water solutions had the highest Zn concentrations for those sediment samples where sphalerite was detected by XRD. Redox sensitive elements such as Fe and Mn could not unequivocally indicate the presence of reducing conditions within the flooded sediments and the redox measurements were carried out only in the overlying water column (ORP above 200 - 350 mV). Low organic matter content and sandy texture would not have favoured the rapid formation of an anoxic layer. Yet, only extending the ORP measurements to the submerged sediment would determine the presence of flooding-induced reducing conditions. Reductive dissolution of Mn oxyhydroxides would result in release of Mn into solution, along with other trace metals, such as Pb and Zn. Mn increased in the inundation water throughout most or all the inundation period for some of the studied sediments. Their final pore water composition was significantly enriched in Mn (1300 - 6500 μg l- 1). Saturation indices indicated both <b>rhodocrosite</b> (MnCO 3) and Mn oxides reached saturation. Therefore, it was not possible to preclude either the role of <b>rhodocrosite</b> as solubility controlling solid phase or the reductive dissolution of Mn oxides for accounting the enhanced Mn concentrations in the pore water and overlying water column without a better characterisation of the solid phase and monitoring of the sediment redox conditions. Amendments to the inundation test design have been recommended, which comprise:  set-up to allow for the continuous monitoring of pore water dynamics and allow for the collection of pore water at the different times and measurement of pore water pH and Eh;  inclusion of a blank test cell, to test the influence of the properties and the volume of the inundation water;  inclusion of flow-cell tests to assess the influence of moving or stagnant inundation water;  the inclusion of abiotic blanks to identify the role microbes play in the solubilisation of contaminants.  complementary characterisation of the solid phase material and metal distribution in the sediment before and after the inundation experiment...|$|E
