40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} new segmentation-free method for keyword {{spotting}} in handwritten documents based on Heat Kernel Signature (HKS). After keypoints are located by the keypoint detector for SIFT on the document pages and the query image, HKS descriptors are extracted {{from a local}} patch centered at each keypoint. In order to locate the positions where the query image appears in document pages, we present a searching method which tries to locate a local zone which contains enough matching keypoints corresponding to the query image. Our method does not need any pre-processing steps. Keyword Spotting is a method used to spot query words in a large collection of documents. Unlike Optical Character Recognition (OCR), which tries to translate every character <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>text,</b> keyword spotting always returns a rankin...|$|R
40|$|Gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} {{data from}} the analysis of complex environmental samples were converted <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>text</b> and imported <b>into</b> a personal computer spreadsheet. A macro was written to perform mass spectral enhancement by statistical and mathematical procedures to separate the spectra of compounds of interest from interfering mass spectral responses, {{such as those of}} broadly eluting hydrocarbons. The extracted mass spectra were compared to reference spectra, with the result that usually 80 – 90 % of the ions common to those in the reference spectra were successfully extracted by using this method. This procedure improved mass spectral quality and the ability of the data system to perform successful library searches. The fitted quality parameters showed systematic improvements after the data were subjected to the spectral enhancement procedures. These procedures could help to identify unknowns by separating their spectra from other signals, such as those of background aliphatic hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a large-scale bilingual corpus of spoken monologues and their simultaneous interpretation, {{which has been}} constructed at CIAIR. The corpus has the following characteristics: (1) English and Japanese speeches are recorded in parallel, (2) the data contains monologue speeches such as lecture and self-introduction, and (3) the exact beginning and ending times are provided for each utterance. We have collected {{a total of about}} 70 hours of speech data and transcribed them <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>text</b> files. The corpus will be made publicly available in the near future. This paper also provides an analysis of the professional interpreter’s speeches using the bilingual corpus. The following points have been investigated: (1) the interpreting unit of simultaneous interpretation, (2) the difference between the beginning time of the lecturer’s utterance and that of the interpreter’s utterance, and (3) the interpreter’s speaking speed. The characteristic features about the timing at which simultaneous interpreters start to speak is presented. The analysis will be available {{for the development of a}} simultaneous machine interpreting system. 1...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} a digitization project {{inspired by the}} innovative leaf morphology classification work of a faculty member in the Geology and Geophysics Department and the Peabody Museum at Yale University. We began our initiative by scanning the Flora Fossilis Arctica, a 7 -volume fossil leaf identification tool covering various geological areas, published between 1868 and 1883. This classic paleobotany resource was digitized, creating tiff, pdf, and searchable pdf files. We are now converting the searchable pdf files <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> <b>text,</b> enhancing the raw data with metadata elements, placing this material on the web for searching and display; and linking this material to an existing set of preserved leaf plates, a locally created index of annotated article clippings, an online leaf morphology tutorial, and the published online literature. Many decisions must be made in terms of host platforms, mark-up standards, search and linking options, and preservation documentation. This article will outline our decision process as we explore the post-digitization dataset handling, which may prove instructive for others attempting to create and link locally digitized materials...|$|R

The internationalization of domain names is a technical solution to translate names written in language-native scripts <b>into</b> an <b>ASCII</b> <b>text</b> representation that is compatible with the Domain Name System. Internationalized domain names can only be used with applications that are specifically designed for such use; they require no changes in the infrastructure of the Internet.|$|R

The GNU shar utility produces a single file out of many files and prepares them for transmission by electronic mail services, for example by converting binary files <b>into</b> plain <b>ASCII</b> <b>text.</b> A shell archive is a collection of files that can be unpacked by the Bourne shell. A wide range of features provide extensive flexibility in manufacturing shar archives and in specifying shar smartness. For example, shar may compress files, uuencode binary files, split long files and construct multi-part mailings, ensure correct unsharing order, and provide md5sum or byte count verification.|$|R
40|$|Raster graphic ampelometric {{software}} was not exclusively {{developed for the}} estimation of leaf area, {{but also for the}} characterization of grapevine (Viti vinifera L.) leaves. The {{software was}} written in C-Hprogramming language, using the C- 1 - 1 - Builder 2007 for Windows 95 -XP and Linux operation systems. It handles desktop-scanned images. On the image analysed with the GRA. LE. D., the user has to determine 11 points. These points are then connected and the distances between them calculated. The GRA. LE. D. software supports standard ampelometric measurements such as leaf area, angles between the veins and lengths of the veins. These measurements are recorded by the software and exported <b>into</b> plain <b>ASCII</b> <b>text</b> files for single or multiple samples. Twenty-two biometric data points of each leaf are identified by the GRA. LE. D. It presents the opportunity to statistically analyse experimental data, allows comparison of cultivars and enables graphic reconstruction of leaves using the Microsoft Excel Chart Wizard. The GRA. LE. D. was thoroughly calibrated and compared to other widely used instruments and methods such as photo-gravimetry, LiCor L 0100, WinDIAS 2. 0 and ImageTool. By comparison, the GRA. LE. D. presented the most accurate measurements of leaf area, but the LiCor L 0100 and the WinDIAS 2. 0 were faster, while the photo-gravimetric method proved to be the most time-consuming. The WinDIAS 2. 0 instrument was the least reliable. The GRA. LE. D. is uncomplicated, user-friendly, accurate, consistent, reliable and has wide practical application...|$|R

In this study, we present desktop software, called PCDReader, which could be an effective and convenient solution for patch clamp data preprocessing for daily laboratory use. We designed a novel class module, called clsPulseData, to directly read the raw data along with the parameters recorded from HEKA instruments without any other program support. By a graphical user interface, raw binary data files can be converted into several kinds of <b>ASCII</b> <b>text</b> files for further analysis, with several preprocessing options. And the parameters can also be viewed, modified and exported <b>into</b> <b>ASCII</b> files by a user-friendly Explorer style window.
