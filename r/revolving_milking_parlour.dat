40|$|Mechanical {{devices in}} parlours {{are a source}} of noise, and this noise has an effect not only on the {{operators}} of the parlour but also on dairy cows. They have more sensitive hearing than humans. The aim of this article was to analyse the sound pressure level and determine the noise exposure of dairy cows at different technological solutions of <b>milking</b> <b>parlours,</b> during their day routine. In the experiment, tandem, herringbone and rotary <b>milking</b> <b>parlours</b> were used. Noise exposure was measured during the milking process. After evaluation of noise pressure levels of different types of <b>milking</b> <b>parlours,</b> it can be concluded that in this experiment, the equivalent noise pressure level was lowest in the tandem <b>milking</b> <b>parlour.</b> Equivalent sound pressure levels in the rotary and herringbone <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> were almost about the same values. These values are higher than values in the tandem <b>milking</b> <b>parlour,</b> about 10 decibels.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluated}} fertility and milk performance due to multiple milking technology which was used. The monitoring was carried in 2011 in farms Agrospol, Malý Bor a. s. and the farm Dub. System evaluation of fertility and milk performance of dairy cows at multiple milking were evaluated in 186 lactations of Czech pied cattle breeding. The average number of <b>milking</b> in the <b>parlour</b> was 2. 96 x/day and robot 2. 36 x/day. 107 lactations were obtained during milking in the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> and 79 of lactation during milking by robots. In this thesis were measured indicators of fertility (insemination interval, service period, the mean time and age at first calving) and indicators of milk production (lactation length, the amount of milk fat, protein and lactose content). In the reproductive indicators were taken statistically highly difference in age at first calving, where the average difference was 195 days. For other indicators of fertility were all statistically significant results in favor of milking in the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> (2. 96 x/day). Czech pied cattle milked in the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> per normative lactation average amount of milk produced 8 599. 8 kg, cows milked by robot 7 272. 5 kg. Among these values was statistically highly significant difference. The best results {{in the production of}} milk per normative lactation were gained by milked cows in the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> (9 284. 4 kg) and the second lactation cows milked in the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> (9 033. 0 kg) on the third and more lactation. The lowest milk production in normative lactation gained dairy cows milked by robot at first lactation (6 874. 7 kg). The higher average fat content had dairy cows milked in the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> with a value of 4. 47 %, dairy cows milked by robot had fat content of 4. 15 %.

40|$|On two farms, three milking {{groups of}} buffalo cows {{were used to}} assess the {{consistency}} of entrance order and the preference for one side of the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour.</b> On Farm 1 (F 1) all animals were primiparous (n= 57). On Farm 2, three primiparous, 16 secondiparous and 36 multiparous cows (range 1 – 8) constituted group F 2 G 1; whereas group F 2 G 2 had 12 primiparous, 10 secondiparous and 14 multiparous cows (range 1 – 10). Animals were milked in auto-tandem <b>milking</b> <b>parlours</b> (2 × 5 and 2 × 6 for Farms 1 and 2, respectively). For each cow, entrance order into <b>milking</b> <b>parlour,</b> side where she was milked, milk yield, time and duration of milking were recorded. These data were derived from the computerised identification of cows. The sequence in which the cows entered themilking parlour ranged from 1 to 57 for group F 1, from 1 to 55 for group F 2 G 1 and from 1 to 36 for group F 2 G 2. The analysis of data was conducted on 130, 120 and 92 consecutive milkings for groups F 1, F 2 G 1 and F 2 G 2, respectively. Kendall’s coefficients of concordance showed a strong constancy of the entrance order into <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> for groups F 1 (W= 0 • 658; χ 2 = 4792 • 81; P< 0 • 001), F 2 G 1 (W= 0 • 779; χ 2 = 5046 • 81; P< 0 • 001) and F 2 G 2 (W= 0 • 624; χ 2 = 2030 • 48; P< 0 • 001).

40|$|Little {{work has}} been carried out on {{management}} techniques to reduce stress of first machine milking in ewes. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> training before weaning on sheep milk yield and milk protein fractions. One week before weaning, an experimental group (EG) was introduced into the machine <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> and hand-milked once a day, to adapt them to the new environment and noise of the milking machine, while a control group (CG) was hand-milked once a day in a traditional fold parlour until weaning. After weaning, both groups were machine milked, separately, twice a day in the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour.</b> <b>Milk</b> yield and nitrogen fractions were recorded for the first 10 days of machine milking. Differences between samplings within group were observed for all parameters considered. Only {{on the first day of}} machine milking, differences between groups occurred for total nitrogen, total protein and casein. Higher content of nitrogen fractions in the milk of EG was due to its lower milk production. In fact, daily production of nitrogen fractions was higher in CG than in EG. High variability for most parameters was observed during the first 5 days of machine milking in both groups.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the effect of {{changing}} the milking sys-tem (from a <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> to automatic <b>milking)</b> on daily yield of cows and cytolo-gical quality of their milk. GLM and FREQ procedures of the SAS package were used in the statistical calculations. The change in the milking system caused a short-term decrease in daily yield and an increase in milk somatic cell count (SCC). In the long term (12 months), daily yield increased (P ≤ 0. 01) from 27. 7 kg milk for cows milked in the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> to 31. 1 kg milk for cows milked automatically. The change in the milking system from the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> to automatic <b>milking</b> had a positive effect on milk somatic cell count as the natural logarithm of SCC decreased from 12. 44 to 11. 97.

40|$|Motor {{activity}} of 158 Polish Holstein-Friesian cows was evaluated 5 times (before and during milking in a DeLaval 2 * 10 <b>milking</b> <b>parlour)</b> {{for both the}} morning and evening milking, on a 5 -point scale, according to the method of Budzyńska et al. (2007). The statistical analysis used multiple logistic regression and classification trees (Enterprise Miner 7. 1 software which comes in with SAS package). In the evaluation of motor activity, cows that {{were among the first}} ten to enter the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> were more often given a score of 3 points before (11. 5 %) and during milking (23. 5 %) compared to the other cows. Cows’ activity tended to decrease (both before and during milking) with advancing lactation. The cows’ reduced activity was accompanied by shorter teat cup attachment times and lower milk yields. The criteria calculated for the quality of models based on classification tree technique as well as logistic regression showed that similar variables were responsible for the re{{activity of}} cows before milking (teat cup attachment time, day of lactation, number of lactation, side of the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour)</b> and during <b>milking</b> (day of lactation, side of the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour,</b> morning or evening milking, milk yield, number of lactation).

40|$|Animal {{welfare is}} an {{important}} topic worldwide. For cows kept in cubicles, Van Eerdenburg et al. developed and validated a welfare scoring system for cows in cubicles. However, in countries with a warm climate cows are held on pasture all year long. To score {{the welfare of the}} cows on pasture in countries such as Uruguay, a barn-based cow comfort scoring system (Verschuuren, 2010; Wolf, 2010) was modified to enable welfare assessment of cows on pasture. The system is based on 13 chapters: general, waiting area, <b>milking</b> <b>parlour,</b> exit <b>milking</b> <b>parlour,</b> water, feeding sites, walkways, loading site, pastures, farmer and staff, environmental management and animal health. In this study the pasture based system is refined. This qualitative study is done during 4 weeks, by visiting 40 dairy farms in Uruguay with Holstein Friesian cows. All parameters were evaluated to establish whether they are required and are useful to determine a good perception of the welfare of the cows. Missing parameters were add to get a correct perception of the welfare of the cows. This results in a new system containing the chapters: general, <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> and pre <b>milking</b> yard, exit <b>milking</b> <b>parlour,</b> water, feeding sites, walkways, loading site, pastures, farmer and staff, environmental management, animal health and youngstock.

These costs were subdivided into long term investments, short term investments, labour, and change of routines. In traditional cost-benefit analyses all costs belonging to the different factors are set on a comparable monetary value. Although in an economic way this is correct, farmers may value some costs in a different way because of certain preferences, influencing the adoption rate of the mastitis reducing measures. The objectives of this study were to explore differences between preferences of cost factors according to Dutch dairy farmers, and to distinguish different groups of farmers accordingly. 136 farmers were questioned by adaptive conjoint analysis about their individual preferences.

Attachment failure is most likely for cows whose udder {{conformation}} is less convenient for robot attachment. In general, after milking failure cows try to revisit the milking robot if they are not sent to a separate area. Since it is difficult to estimate the effect of milking failure on such a cow and her welfare in conditions of robotic milking, a specific 16 -day trial was conducted on 12 cows. These cows were milked in a <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> with six <b>milking</b> stalls. Each afternoon milking, three cows were not milked. All the cows were closely observed in the cubicle house for 1 h after the afternoon milking. Thereafter, all cows were brought to the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> the third time and the three unmilked cows were milked. In total, each cow was observed 12 times after milking and four times after omitted milking. The following behavioural traits were registered: time budget for the 1 h, occurrence and time until eating, drinking, lying, urination and defecation, and aggressive interactions. Milking order was defined on the basis of how often a cow came to the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> in the first batch of six cows. Moreover, the data related to the milk yield {{and the use of the}} automatic feeding installation with the complete diet were analysed. After omitted milking, only the cows from the first batch stood longer in cubicles (14. 2 min of 1 h) and lay less (5. 4 min of 1 h) than milked cows of the same batch (respectively 7. 0 min and 16. 3 min for standing and lying in cubicles) (P < 0. 01). After omitted milking, cows urinated earlier and more frequently (64. 5 %) than milked cows (36. 3 %) (P < 0. 002) (both batches). There were no statistically significant differences in eating time and feed intake after milking and omitted milking. Milk yield per cow averaged 24. 9 kg during days with omitted (delayed by 1 h) milking and 25. 3 kg during the days without omitted milking (P < 0. 05). It was concluded that cows show some signs of discomfort after omitted milking (urination); this discomfort seemed to be greater in cows coming earlier to the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> (afterwards they preferred to stand rather than to lie). The 60 % of cases of milk leakage found after omitted milking indicates that failed cluster attachment can be accompanied by an extra risk factor for the occurrence of mastitis. However, omitted milking as a treatment did not influence feeding and aggressive behaviour or milking order when unmilked cows were brought to the <b>milking</b> <b>parlour</b> the third time together with the milked cows. Our methods and results can be useful for estimating the effects of robot milking failures on a cow. Future studies should pay particular attention to high-yielding cows and to longer periods of delayed milking. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
