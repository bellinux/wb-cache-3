40|$|In a concurrent-chains procedure, pigeons' {{responses}} on {{left and right}} keys were followed by reinforcers of different durations at different delays following the choice responses. Three pairs of <b>reinforcer</b> delays were arranged in each session, and <b>reinforcer</b> durations were varied over conditions. In Experiment 1 <b>reinforcer</b> delays were unequal, and in Experiment 2 <b>reinforcer</b> delays were equal. In Experiment 1 preference reversal was demonstrated in that an immediate short <b>reinforcer</b> was chosen more frequently than a longer <b>reinforcer</b> delayed 6 s from the choice, whereas the longer <b>reinforcer</b> was chosen more frequently when delays to both reinforcers were lengthened. In both experiments, choice responding was more sensitive to variations in <b>reinforcer</b> duration at overall longer <b>reinforcer</b> delays than at overall shorter <b>reinforcer</b> delays, independently of whether fixed-interval or variable-interval schedules were arranged in the choice phase. We concluded that preference reversal results from a change in sensitivity of choice responding to ratios of <b>reinforcer</b> duration as the delays to both reinforcers are lengthened...|$|R

50|$|A {{secondary}} <b>reinforcer,</b> {{sometimes called}} a conditioned <b>reinforcer,</b> is a stimulus or situation that has acquired its {{function as a}} <b>reinforcer</b> after pairing with a stimulus that functions as a <b>reinforcer.</b> This stimulus may be a primary <b>reinforcer</b> or another conditioned <b>reinforcer</b> (such as money). An example of a secondary <b>reinforcer</b> would be the sound from a clicker, as used in clicker training. The sound of the clicker {{has been associated with}} praise or treats, and subsequently, the sound of the clicker may function as a <b>reinforcer.</b> Another common example is the sound of people clapping - there is nothing inherently positive about hearing that sound, but we have learned that it is associated with praise and rewards.|$|R

50|$|Reinforcement is a {{relative}} property. Responses A, B, C have a descending rank order of probability. A will therefore <b>reinforce</b> both B and C. C will <b>reinforce</b> neither.

An alternative approach is proposed that emphasizes the inductive effects of the <b>reinforcer</b> schedule as a unit and the effects of particular aspects of the <b>reinforcer</b> schedule (e. g., interreinforcer interval, repetition of the <b>reinforcer,</b> <b>reinforcer</b> magnitude) ...|$|R

Two experimental subjects showed preference for the large <b>reinforcer</b> even when the consequences for pecking the two keys were switched.

5|$|A hatch or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow hatches to be opened and closed are called hatch cover. In general, hatch covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, hatches must be large, but large hatches present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the hatches, and these areas must be <b>reinforced.</b> Often, hatch areas are <b>reinforced</b> by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|E

Subjects consistently chose the large <b>reinforcer.</b> When the delay to the small <b>reinforcer</b> was decreased to 0. 1 s in the next experimental condition, all subjects continued to choose the large 6. 0 -s delayed <b>reinforcer.</b> When the contingencies correlated with the two levers were reversed in the next experimental condition, the majority of subjects (5 males and 6 females) still chose the large delayed <b>reinforcer</b> over the small immediately presented <b>reinforcer.</b> The delay to the small <b>reinforcer</b> was maintained at 6. 0 s, but the delay to the large <b>reinforcer</b> was varied among 9. 0, 15. 0, 24. 0, and 36. 0 s in Experiment 2, in which 4 males and 4 females participated.

40|$|Two {{dimensions}} of reinforcement that influence behavior are <b>reinforcer</b> magnitude and stimulus type. One type of stimulus involving high technology (i. e., hightech stimuli) {{has not been}} examined to determine reinforcement properties. This project examined the interactions of <b>reinforcer</b> magnitude and high-tech stimuli {{and the effects of}} those interactions on preference and <b>reinforcer</b> efficacy. Participants included three adult individuals with disabilities. Two multiple stimulus without replacement (MSWO) preference assessments were conducted to determine a highly preferred high-tech stimulus and a highly preferred no-tech stimulus for each participant. A paired stimulus preference assessment was conducted to identify preferred <b>reinforcer</b> magnitudes using both highly preferred stimuli (high- and no-tech). A progressive ratio (PR) <b>reinforcer</b> assessment was then conducted to assess the effects of stimulus type and <b>reinforcer</b> magnitude on <b>reinforcer</b> efficacy. Results demonstrated a preference for high-tech stimuli at longer durations of access for two participants. Results also demonstrated participants responded more for high-tech stimuli as <b>reinforcer</b> magnitudes were increased, and responded less for no-tech stimuli as <b>reinforcer</b> magnitudes were increased (measured as total number of responses during the PR assessments). These results provide further evidence of the effects of <b>reinforcer</b> magnitude and stimulus type (high-tech stimuli) on preference and <b>reinforcer</b> efficacy and have implications for clinicians and caregivers using high- and no-tech items as reinforcers...|$|R
