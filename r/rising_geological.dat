The plug of salt <b>rises</b> through <b>geological</b> formations of Tertiary geologic age. The top of the salt mass is about 500 ft below the surface and above it are limestone, gypsum, and anhydrite. Petroleum was trapped around the salt dome in sandstone and limestone layers. Five million barrels of crude oil were extracted from 85 wells in the years up to 1924. In the year 1930 alone the mound yielded 224,000 barrels of oil.|$|R

It was pronounced by locals as Be-arn Back which has since become corrupted into the current name Birnbeck. The rock is limestone, giving <b>rise</b> to the <b>geological</b> term [...] "Birnbeck Limestone Formation".|$|R

40|$|Tectonic {{models for}} the {{evolution}} of passive continental margins predict that following rifting, sediments should progressively onlap basement {{at the edge of a}} margin as the lithosphere cools and increases its flexural rigidity with age. The pattern of modelled onlap is strikingly similar to that used by Vail and colleagues to estimate sea-level <b>rise</b> through <b>geological</b> time. This similarity suggests that major portions of stratigraphical sequences at margins may have a tectonic, rather than eustatic, control. The patterns of onlap used by Vail and colleagues may be widespread, however, because several widely separated passive margins rifted at similar times, but they are unlikely to be worldwide. © 1982 Nature Publishing Group...|$|R
50|$|Swash {{plays an}} {{important}} role as one of the instantaneous coastal processes and it {{is as important as the}} long-term processes such as sea level <b>rise</b> and <b>geological</b> processes in coastal morphodynamics. Swash zone is one of the most dynamic and rapidly changing environments on the coast and it is strongly linked with the surf zone processes. Understanding the swash mechanism is essential for the understanding of formation and changes of the swash zone morphology. More importantly, understanding of the swash zone processes is vital for society to manage coast wisely. There has been significant progress in the last two decades, however, gaps in understanding and knowledge in swash research still remain today.|$|R

Twelve {{out of the}} 15 species that compose this section {{are found in the}} Peruvian territory from North to South in the eastern Andean foothills and western Amazonian lowlands. All these species have a parapatric distribution, except for Astrocaryum macrocalyx and A. urostachys, which share a very limited area. Limits of distribution areas may be related to geographical, geomorphological and ecological barriers (river, <b>geological</b> <b>rising,</b> soil drainage).

40|$|Beach {{processes}} and coastal development {{are affected by}} changes in sea level. Studies ofshoreline and sea level changes have become very important. In recent years, sea level changeis being studied by many geologists, as well as coastal engineers. The {{purpose of this paper}} isto clarify the characteristics of shoreline changes associated with sea level <b>rising</b> from historicaland <b>geological</b> times. Because recent subsidence in coastal areas contributes to shoreline changes,data of tidal observation are rearranged carefully. It is concluded that the annual rising ratesof sea level are estimated to be about 2 mm in Osaka and 1 mm in Aburatsubo respectively,and that beach erosion at Niigata coast is caused significantly by subsidence due to miningnatural gas, plus by action of stormy waves...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{discovery}} of the ice ages began with {{the invention of the}} Great Ice Age by Louis Agassiz, {{in the first half of}} the nineteenth century. His ideas were shaped by the interpretation of skeletons and frozen remains of large mammals found in Siberia. at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The concept of the Great Ice Age stands in contrast to earlier notions emphasizing wide-spread flooding, notions that owed much to the Great Flood described inthe Bible, and which gave <b>rise</b> to <b>geological</b> terms such as 'diluvial deposits " and 'glacial drift'. Nordic myth as recorded in Iceland uring the Middle Ages likewise contains observations and interpretations concerning the remains of giant animals emerging from frozen ground and makes reference to large-scale flood-ing. The ancient cosmogony related by Icelandic poets postulates the former existence of a kingdom of ice, represented by a primeval Ice Giant, whose rule is ended by the newly emerged gods. According to the myth, the melting of ice (the blood of the dying Giant) caused widespread flooding that killed the large creatures abundant during ice time. There was a time, not so long ago (in the 19 th century), when the geologically oung deposits left behind by vast ice sheets originating in Scandinavi...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMorphometric {{analyses}} of Apis cerana workers from 123 localities in oceanic Asia {{were made on}} the whole oceanic group, within specific island systems, and specific mainland-oceanic island "interfaces". Principal component analysis of the total oceanic database yielded two distinct morphoclusters: (1) the bees of Japan and morphocluster and (2) the bees {{of all the other}} islands. Discriminant and hierarchical cluster analyses showed overlapping regional clusters in the latter: 2. 1 the bees of the Philippines (except Palawan) and some Indonesia, 2. 2 bees of Palawan, Malaysian Borneo, Kalimantan, Sumatera and some Sulawesi (Indonesia), and 2. 3 most of Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Hainan (China) and Sri Lanka. Significant differences between the means of the four groups were demonstrated using Wilks' lambda statistic.

2500|$|Coal mining {{releases}} methane, {{a potent}} greenhouse gas. Methane is the naturally occurring {{product of the}} {{decay of organic matter}} as coal deposits are formed with increasing depths of burial, rising temperatures, and <b>rising</b> pressure over <b>geological</b> time. A portion of the methane produced is absorbed by the coal and later released from the coal seam (and surrounding disturbed strata) during the mining process. Methane accounts for 10.5 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions created through human activity. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, methane has a global warming potential 21 times greater than that of carbon dioxide over a 100-year timeline. [...] The process of mining can release pockets of methane. These gases may pose a threat to coal miners, as well as a source of air pollution. This is due to the relaxation of pressure and fracturing of the strata during mining activity, which gives rise to safety concerns for the coal miners if not managed properly. The buildup of pressure in the strata can lead to explosions during (or after) the mining process if prevention methods, such as [...] "methane draining", are not taken.|$|R

Over {{millions}} of years have undergone significant ch an g e s brought about by numerous geological phenomena aimed at your balance, some internal order, creating new geological formations and other external order smoothing formations previously created. From t h e tectonic standpoint, Angola {{is located in a}} relatively stable area which gives it a certain p ri v i l e g e w h e n compared with some Asian countries or even Americans where quite often occur earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. However, the same cannot be said in relation to the occurrence of an external geodynamics phenomena, such as the ravines, which in recent years has taken shape in many provinces, especially due to anthropogenic activity, giving <b>rise</b> to <b>geological</b> hazards, increasing the risk of damage in buildings and others infrastructures, losses direct or indirect in economic activities and loss of human lives. We understand that the reducing of these risks starts, in particular, by their identification, for later take preventive measures. This work is the result of some research work carried out by the authors through erosion courses of s o i l and stabilization of soils subject to erosion phenomena, carried out by Engineering Laboratory of Angola (LEA). For the realization of this work, we resorted to cartographic data query, literature, listening to s o m e o f the provincial representatives and local residents, as well as the observation in lo co o f s o m e af f e ct ed areas. The results allow us to infer that the main provinces affected by ravine phenomenon are located in Central and Northern highlands, {{as well as in the}} eastern region, and more recently in Cuando-Cub an go province. Not ruling out, however, other regions, such as in Luanda and Cabinda [1]. Relatively the causes, we can say that the ravines in Angola are primarily due to the combination of three natural factors: climate, topography and type of soil [2]. When we add the anthropogenic activit y, namely the execution of construction works, the drainage system obstructio n, exploration of m i n e ral s, agriculture and fires, it is verified an increasing of the phenomenon, often requiring immedi at e act i o n. These interventions can be done through structural or engineering measures and by the stabilization measures on the degraded soil cover [3]. We present an example of stabilization measures throu g h t h e deployment of a local vegetation called Pennisetum purpureum. It is expected that the results may contribute to a better understanding of the causes of the ravine phenomenon in Angola and that the adopted stabilization method can be adapted in other affected provinces in order to prevent and making the contention of the ravines...|$|R
40|$|Meltwater pulse 1 A (MWP- 1 A) is {{the largest}} land ice melt event of the last deglaciation. In a period {{of no more than}} 340 years, between 14. 65 and 14. 31 ka (Dechamps et al, 2012), ~ 10 % of the total deglacial sea-level rise {{occurred}} (Hanebuth et al, 2000; Peltier and Fairbanks, 2006; Deschamps et al, 2012), resulting in the highest reported rate of global mean sea-level <b>rise</b> in the <b>geological</b> record, which may have exceeded 4 m per century (Deschamps et al, 2012). Yet, the implications of MWP- 1 A for constraining the rates of the underlying processes and its role in the sequence of climate events during Termination 1 remain unclear {{due to the lack of}} information on its melt source distribution. While glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) modelling experiments (Clark et al, 2002; Bassett et al, 2005; Deschamps et al, 2012) and recent assessments of ice-sheet histories (Carlson and Clark, 2012) suggest that at least 50 % of the event may have come from Antarctica, other interpretations of Antarctic ice-extent and sea-level records suggest a substantially smaller (including zero) Antarctic contribution (Ackert et al, 2007; Mackintosh et al, 2011; Whitehouse et al, 2012). In this study, we show that after reassessments of local MWP- 1 A amplitudes at Barbados and Sunda Shelf based on the well-constrained timing derived from the Tahiti sea-level record (Deschamps et al, 2012), the sea-level data from Barbados, Sunda Shelf, and Tahiti do not provide as tight of a constraint on the Antarctic contribution as previously thought. We find that between 1 to 10 m sea-level equivalent (sle) could have melted from the Antarctic, compared to 7 to 15 m sle from previous analyses (Clark et al, 2002; Bassett et al, 2005; Deschamps et al, 2012). To better constrain the source of MWP- 1 A, we also consider sea-level data from Scotland (Shennan et al, 2000), which have, until now, been excluded from MWP- 1 A fingerprinting experiments because they are strongly influenced by local ice unloading. To overcome this, we isolate the elastic MWP- 1 A amplitude (i. e. fingerprint signal) at this location using a suite of models that provide optimal fits to the Scottish data, and thereby remove near-field contamination. Preliminary results show that the inclusion of these data leads to an improved MWP- 1 A source distribution constraint compared to that obtained using the far- and intermediate-field data alone...|$|R
