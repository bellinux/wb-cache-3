2500|$|Red tide algal blooms (blooms of {{single-celled}} algae) {{known as}} the Peridinium bipes, noticed to proliferate intensely at the Tsukabaru reservoir from the later part of the 1970s, is a serious environmental problem that has received due attention of the agency involved with the project. It is inferred that the algal development is not on account of eutrophication or unusual growth of plankton but is on account of accumulation of stable cyst {{on the surface of}} the reservoir caused due to the process of phototaxis at the inlet end of the reservoir and spread to cover the reservoir surface completely. Its annual occurrence was noted since 1990. This process created extensive cultivation of Peridinium bipes of dinoflagellate, which generated a foul smell and discolored the water surface area thus marring the scenic beauty of the reservoir. This necessitated instituting measures to eradicate the problem. Various alternative treatments were examined, such as cyclic aeration, treatment after collection, use of ozone and ultraviolet irradiation; the ultraviolet irradiation method has been chosen and put into practice.

40|$|Red tide is a {{temporary}} natural phenomenon involving harmful algal blooms (HABs) in company with a changing sea color from normal to red or reddish brown, and which has a bad influence on coast environments and sea ecosystems. The HABs have inflicted massive mortality on fin fish and shellfish, damaging the economies of fisheries for almost every year from 1990 in South Korea. There {{has been a lot}} of study on <b>red</b> <b>tide</b> due to increasing of <b>red</b> <b>tide</b> damage.

Especially, extraction of matching center of image features for recognizing algae image object is difficult because over 200 species of algae in the world have a different size and features.

50|$|Many mixotrophic {{and some}} {{heterotrophic}} dinoflagellates {{are known to}} cause <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> or harmful blooms that result in large-scale mortality of fish and shellfish. Studies on <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> have been conducted to determine the mechanism of outbreak and the persistence of <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> caused by mixotrophic dinoflagellates such as Karenia brevis, Prorocentrum donghaiense and Prorocentrum minimum in low nutrient concentration waters. In the case of serial <b>red</b> <b>tides,</b> one mixotrophic dinoflagellate species is dominated by another mixotrophic species in rapid succession over a short span of days. A {{possible explanation for the}} occurrence of different dominant mixotrophic dinoflagellates during serial <b>red</b> <b>tides</b> is the ability of mixotrophic dinoflagellates to feed on both heterotrophic bacteria and cyanobacteria (such as Synecchococcus) spp., which provide limiting nutrients such as phosphorus, and nitrogen simultaneously. It is proposed that during serial <b>red</b> <b>tides,</b> feeding by larger mixotrophic dinoflagellates on smaller species may be a driving force for the succession of dominant species. Nitrogen and phosphorus is taken up by direct transfer of the materials and energy between the mixotrophic dinoflagellates; therefore, nutrient supply does not rely on the release of nitrogen and phosphorus by other organisms. Hence, mixotrophy can cause uncoupling between nutrient concentrations and the abundance of mixotrophic dinoflagellates in natural environments.|$|E
