5|$|In December 1944 the United States Navy's {{high command}} became {{concerned}} that the IJN would attempt to cut the supply line to the planned beachhead at Lingayen Gulf. On 26 December a Japanese naval force operating from Cam Ranh Bay in Japanese-controlled French Indochina shelled the Allied beachhead at Mindoro, but inflicted no damage.

5000|$|In August 1965, growing American {{involvement}} in the Vietnam War prompted the transfer of MSTS ships from the Atlantic to the Pacific. General Alexander M. Patch commenced her first Vietnam voyage at New York on 15 August.

5000|$|Historically we've kind of alternated between Dirt and the Grid series, {{but when}} we put Grid 2 out we stood back and took stock {{and there was a}} lot of stuff the dev team wanted to have in there in terms of optimisation, new {{features}} and generally improving things. At the same time there was a fair amount of feedback from the fans with regards to what they wanted, so additional touring car content, the <b>return</b> of cockpit <b>cam</b> and more of a nudge back to simulation rather than arcade. We though(…) we'd keep it rolling. Codemasters Producer Toby Evan-Jones ...|$|R
5000|$|The Niagara Falls was {{included}} {{on a list}} of ships that were exposed to Agent Orange. The Department of Veterans Affairs identified certain vessel types that operated primarily or exclusively on the inland Vietnam waterways. Because she went up river, USS Niagara Falls was recognized as exposed to contaminated waterways during missions on the Saigon River and in Cam Rahn Bay, 22-25 April 1968. Throughout the war, the [...] "Falls" [...] was further exposed to runoff of Agent Orange and other herbicides when she anchored in Da Nang Harbor, <b>returned</b> to <b>Cam</b> Rahn Bay, and steamed along littoral waters of South Vietnam. Studies of Australian naval ships show that salt water evaporative distilling systems actually increased the concentration of Agent Orange in drinking and cooking water, and the distilling system became coated in herbicide toxins. [...] The Department of Veterans Affairs is yet to recognize these Australian studies and grant health coverage to the [...] "bluewater" [...] sailors who have been exposed on the [...] "Niagara Falls" [...] and other navy ships that performed missions along the Vietnam coast.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{standard}} {{computer memory}} (random access memory or RAM) {{in which the}} user supplies a memory address and the RAM returns the data word stored at that address, a CAM is designed such that the user supplies a data word and the CAM searches its entire memory {{to see if that}} data word is stored anywhere in it. If the data word is found, the <b>CAM</b> <b>returns</b> a list of one or more storage addresses where the word was found (and in some architectures, it also returns the contents of that storage address, or other associated pieces of data). Thus, a CAM is the hardware embodiment of what in software terms would be called an associative array.The data word recognition unit was proposed by Dudley Allen Buck in 1955.|$|R
50|$|In 1944, due to {{the tense}} {{condition}} of the war, Hoàng <b>Cầm</b> <b>returned</b> to his hometown Thuận Thành and participated in the Việt Minh movement. After the August Revolution, Hoàng Cầm once again went to Hanoi and found a theatre company named Đông Phương. He began to organize cultural activities for the Vietnam People's Army from 1952 {{in the position of}} the Director of the Public Performing Company (Văn công) of the General Department of Politics. After the First Indochina War, Hoàng Cầm worked for the Vietnam Association of Writers from which he soon withdrew in 1958 because of his involvement in the Nhân Văn affair. In March 2007, Hoàng Cầm was awarded the National Prize for Literature and Art by the Government of Vietnam. He died on 6 May 2010 in Hanoi at the age of 88.|$|R
2500|$|In the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 24 October 1944, Ashigara, with Captain Hayao Miura in command, was {{assigned}} to Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima's force along with Nachi and eight destroyers.

40|$|Background: Use of {{complementary}} {{and alternative}} medicine (CAM), and especially CAM practitioners, {{has continued to}} rise in recent years. Although several motivators of CAM use have been identified, {{little is known about}} how and if the motivations for using CAM have changed over time. The purpose of the current study was to compare the reasons for consulting CAM practitioners in consumers in 1997 – 8 and eight years later in 2005. Methods: Surveys were displayed in CAM and conventional medicine offices and clinics in Ontario, Canada in 1997 – 8 and again in 2005, and self-selected participants returned the surveys by mail.

500|$|... "I Am Your Leader" [...] gained {{positive}} reviews. Andrew Unterberger of Popdust {{gave it a}} 4-star rating, complimenting Minaj's rapping as well as {{the guest}} verses of Cam'ron and Rick Ross. However, Unterberger felt that Minaj was overshadowed by the guest verses. Andrew Hampp of Billboard echoed Unterberger's sentiments, saying [...] "The nostalgia of <b>Cam's</b> <b>return</b> trumps the overall catchiness of the song." [...] XXL Magazine stated that [...] "Though many of the early songs [...] lack real substance, the records remain generally exciting - “I Am Your Leader,” alongside Rick Ross and Cam’ron, “Beez In The Trap” with 2 Chainz, and the triumphant “Champion” featuring Nas, Drake and Young Jeezy are all memorable moments". Joe Rivers No Ripcord praised [...] "I Am Your Leader" [...] along with [...] "Beez in the Trap" [...] for being [...] "thrilling" [...] and making [...] "good use of cameos". Stephen Deusner of Paste Magazine said that [...] "On the nursery rhyming “I Am Your Leader,” [...] spits yet another dick joke like a playground jeer, slyly undermining hip-hop’s traditionally male-centric braggadocio. She’s not only participating in phallocentric boasting; she’s also inflating the convention with a Swedish penis pump until it’s just shy of bursting".|$|R
