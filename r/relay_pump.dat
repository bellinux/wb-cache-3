40|$|This study {{proves the}} {{effectiveness}} of air-aided transport in reducing pipeline resistance and lengthening transport distance. The adopted experimental apparatus is unique in its chosen pipes (120 mm), transmission mediums (including clean water and slurries concentrated at 10, 20 and 30 %, respectively) and experiment comparisons between air-aided transport and traditional <b>relay</b> <b>pump</b> transport. Factors such as resistance, transport distance and energy consumption are compared through the data from laboratory experiments, thus proving the evident advantages from air-aided transport. The total energy consumption in air-aided transport is {{less than that of}} <b>relay</b> <b>pump,</b> especially within its resistance reducing scope, where slurry flow ranges from 65 m 3 /h to 90 m 3 /h. It also exists within resistance reducing scope where slurry flow of air-aided transport is less than that of <b>relay</b> <b>pump</b> transport and may reach its limited effective distance. Thus, {{the findings of this study}} can provide valuable insight for the optimization design of air-aided transport of cutter-suction dredger...|$|E

The Idle Air Control Valve (IACV) (previously known as an Idle Air Stabiliser Valve - IASV), receives a changing milliamp signal that varies the strength of an electromagnet pulling open the bypass valve.|$|R
40|$|Electrodeposition {{processes}} were {{proposed for}} the fabrication of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) long time ago. Patterned layers of nickel, nickel alloys, gold alloys, silver and copper are used to realize micro switches, <b>relays,</b> valves, <b>pumps,</b> coils and gyroscopes. The metal layers have to meet the highest requirements on homogeneity, {{as well as on}} mechanical, electric or magnetic characteristics. The application of microelectroplating has to cope with specific effects influencing the electroplating conditions in the micrometer range. So, many efforts concentrate on the control and standardisation of microelectroplating processes. The suitability and application of electroplating methods will be exemplified by two concepts of a microrelay assigned for current loads of up to several amperes. The development of these microrelays is object of the project "MikroRel", partially funded by the German ministry for education and research (BMBF) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{ignition}} switch does not carry {{the power to}} the fuel pump; instead, it activates a relay which will handle the higher current load. It is common for the fuel <b>pump</b> <b>relay</b> to become oxidized and cease functioning; this is much more common than the actual fuel pump failing. Modern engines utilize solid-state control which allows the fuel pressure to be controlled via pulse-width modulation of the pump voltage. This increases {{the life of the}} pump, allows a smaller and lighter device to be used, and reduces electrical load.|$|R

This robot uses dc motors, castor wheel, microcontroller, sensors, pump and sprinkler. Microcontroller {{is the heart of the}} project. Microcontroller controls all the parts of the robot by the use of programming. In this robot as the fire sensor senses the fire, it sends the signal to microcontroller; since the signal of the sensor is very weak the amplifier is used so that it can amplify the signal and sends it to microcontroller. As soon as microcontroller receives the signal a buzzer sounds, the buzzer sound is to intimate the occurrence of fire accident. After the sounding of the buzzer microcontroller actuates the driver circuit and it drives the robot towards fire place, as the robot reaches near the fire microcontroller actuates the <b>relay</b> and <b>pump</b> switch is made ON and water is sprinkled on the fire through the sprinkler...|$|R

30|$|Norepinephrine {{is widely}} used as a {{first-line}} treatment to support blood pressure in critically ill patients [1]. Because of its narrow therapeutic range and very short half-life, all undesired changes in norepinephrine flow rates may lead to acute and potentially life-threatening changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP) [2]. In numerous countries, {{and almost all of}} Europe, norepinephrine is administered through high-precision electric syringe pumps [2 – 4]. As the volume of the syringes is limited (e.g. 60  ml for adults), changeovers of the norepinephrine infusion pumps (CNIPs) generally occur several times a day in an intensive care unit (ICU). Maintaining a constant flow rate during CNIP is challenging, and haemodynamic instability has been reported in up to one-third of vasoactive infusion <b>pump</b> <b>relays</b> [2 – 7].|$|R
50|$|Between Port-Marly and Bezons, the Seine, {{along its}} length, {{was divided into}} two arms {{by a series of}} islands and earth berms linked {{together}} by timber/rock dikes to form two disconnected, parallel river beds over ten kilometers in length. The hydraulic pumping machinery, propelling the river water {{to the top of the}} hill that borders the Seine, was constructed across from the left arm of the river, a little below the small village of La Chaussée, downstream of Bougival. A dam at Bezons on the right arm creates a hydraulic head measuring 3.1 meters (10 feet 2 inches) high to power the wheels of the Machine de Marly. The upper <b>pumping</b> <b>relay</b> station (demolished) was located next to the Château des Eaux (1700) and pumped water to the top of the Louveciennes aqueduct, which fed the Louveciennes and Marly reservoirs, near the site of the Château de Marly (demolished).|$|R
40|$|Survival {{models are}} being widely {{applied to the}} {{engineering}} field to model time-to-event data once censored data is here a common issue. Using parametric models or not, for the case of heterogeneous data, they may not always represent a good fit. The present study <b>relays</b> on critical <b>pumps</b> survival data where traditional parametric regression might be improved {{in order to obtain}} better approaches. Considering censored data and using an empiric method to split the data into two subgroups to give the possibility to fit separated models to our censored data, we’ve mixture two distinct distributions according a mixture-models approach. We have concluded that it is a good method to fit data that does not fit to a usual parametric distribution and achieve reliable parameters. A constant cumulative hazard rate policy was used as well to check optimum inspection times using the obtained model from the mixture-model, which could be a plus when comparing with the actual maintenance policies to check whether changes should be introduced or not...|$|R
40|$|Episodes of {{hypoglycemia}} and hyperglycemia {{in between}} blood glucose checks—especially during sleep— can go unrecognized {{for children and}} adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM). Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems have introduced a new tool to monitor glucose levels for people with diabetes in real time and to alert them when glucose levels are above or below target range. However, many of the alarms are not heard at night by the children or adolescents or by their parents who oversee their treatment. The mySentry ™ system is a device {{that is designed to}} <b>relay</b> real-time insulin <b>pump</b> and CGM data for display elsewhere in the house. In this issue of Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology, Kaiserman and coauthors report on the acceptability, usefulness, and user friendliness of the mySentry for families with children and adolescents with T 1 DM, which was determined by survey results during a 3 -week study period. Based on the results, the mySentry system met all predefined criteria for acceptability without safety issues in this small-scale, short-term study and as an example of wireless systems integration in diabetes management.
