However, he felt that Eccleston was [...] "the show's biggest disappointment" [...] as he seemed unsuited to a fantasy role. Digital Spy's Dek Hogan stated that production values had increased from the classic series, and praised the acting and characters of Eccleston, Piper, and Clarke. However, he felt that some of the humour— such as the wheelie bin burping after it consumes Mickey— was not as enjoyable as an adult. The Sydney Morning Herald reviewer Robin Oliver praised Davies for [...] " [...] an adult approach to one of television's most famous characters" [...] and [...] " [...] the cash-strapped production values of the past to make his new doctor competitive in a high-tech market". Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times described the revival as [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "intelligent and well-done".
