50|$|To print an {{intaglio}} plate, ink {{is applied}} to the surface by wiping and/or dabbing the plate to push the ink into the recessed lines, or grooves. The plate is then rubbed with tarlatan cloth to remove most of the excess ink. The final smooth wipe is often done with newspaper or old public phone book pages, leaving ink only in the incisions. A damp piece of paper is placed on top of the plate, so that when going through the press the damp paper will be able to be squeezed into the plate's ink-filled grooves. The paper and plate are then covered by a thick blanket to ensure even pressure when going through the <b>rolling</b> <b>press.</b> The <b>rolling</b> <b>press</b> applies very high pressure through the blanket to push the paper into the grooves on the plate. The blanket is then lifted, revealing the paper and printed image.|$|E
50|$|Siderography is a {{mechanical}} process developed by Jacob Perkins {{in the early}} 1800s enabling the unlimited reproduction of engraved steel plates.

5000|$|The couple did {{not have}} children, {{and it has been}} {{suggested}} that Blake wanted to bring a concubine into the relationship to act as a surrogate mother, which was consistent with the theories of Swedenborgianism by which Blake was influenced. Blake's earliest biographer Alexander Gilchrist does not mention this, but speaks of unspecified troubles in the early years of the relationship. However, Algernon Charles Swinburne later explicitly asserted that this was the case, but that Blake dropped the idea when he saw that it upset Catherine. No documentary evidence survives supporting this notion, but Blake is known to have stated that he [...] "learned from the Bible that wives should be held in common."Writers who knew the couple in their later years describe a very happy relationship. In 1802, William Hayley wrote that William [...] "and his excellent wife (a true helpmate!) pass the plates thro' a <b>rolling</b> <b>press</b> in their own cottage together". On his deathbed, Blake drew a picture of Catherine as his last work, stating [...] "you have ever been an angel to me".|$|E
50|$|The first {{widely used}} method of color {{photography}} was the Autochrome plate, a process inventors and brothers Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re {{began working on}} in the 1890s and commercially introduced in 1907. It was based on one of Louis Ducos du Hauron's ideas: instead of taking three separate photographs through color filters, take one through a mosaic of tiny color filters overlaid on the emulsion and view the results through an identical mosaic. If the individual filter elements were small enough, the three primary colors of red, blue, and green would blend together {{in the eye and}} produce the same additive color synthesis as the filtered projection of three separate photographs. Autochrome plates had an integral mosaic filter layer with roughly five million previously dyed potato grains per square inch added to the surface. Then {{through the use of a}} <b>rolling</b> <b>press,</b> five tons of pressure were used to flatten the grains, enabling every one of them to capture and absorb color and their microscopic size allowing the illusion that the colors are merged together. The final step was adding a coat of the light capturing substance silver bromide after which a color image could be imprinted and developed. In order to see it, reversal processing was used to develop each plate into a transparent positive that could be viewed directly or projected with an ordinary projector. One of the drawbacks of the technology is an exposure time of at least a second was required during the day in bright light and the worse the light is, the time required quickly goes up. An indoor portrait required a few minutes with the subject not being able to move or else the picture would come out blurry. This was because the grains absorbed the color fairly slowly and that a filter of a yellowish-orange color was added to the plate to keep the photograph from coming out excessively blue. Although necessary, the filter had the effect of reducing the amount of light that was absorbed. Another drawback was that the film could only be enlarged so much until the many dots that make up the image become apparent.|$|E

The drawings, which {{at first sight}} looked so mysterious and unintelligible, the more they were pondered, {{unfolded}} their wondrous meaning and beauty; and from my own experience I can testify, that sitting for weeks before the same drawing, I did not tire over them, {{as was the case}} with inferior pictures. The plates executed from 1833 to 1836 consisted of the illustrations to Scott's Works, Turner's 'Annual Tour', Gainsborough's 'Watering Place', a large Venice, by Turner and, of course, some plates of less note. The plates for Rogers's poems were engraved before my time, but not published till afterwards; these are probably the most exquisite gems that ever were, or ever will be produced. I beg however to differ from Ruskin in my estimate of them. I like Loch Lomond, and the old Ancestral Hall better than the vignette, with the fountain, at the beginning of the volume...........The Gainsborough was entirely the work of your father's own hand; it was done from a smaller copy of the original in the National Gallery. The pencil drawing was sent as usual to be transferred by the printer through the <b>rolling</b> <b>press</b> on to the etching ground, but when it came back the drawing was found to have shifted during the process, and the transferred outlines were thick and blurred. I should have been appalled, but your father made light of it, and etched away as if it had been all right."I need hardly say that it is as the interpreter of Turner your father's fame very much rests, and that Turner himself preferred 'the Scotch Quaker' to all other engravers. The skill with which he translated the high aerial effects was beyond all rivalry.........."In making the outline drawings for transference to the plate, we were instructed to preserve every minute touch, indeed, keeping the touch was a point much insisted on. I remember an amusing instance of this. I was etching the Pass of Killicrankie, a vignette for Scott's Works; cottages were in flames, and the dead lying in the foreground; in the distance was a row of dark spots - the subject suggested they might be a regiment of soldiers, at the same time they looked very much like fir-trees. I asked your father's opinion, he reply was 'Oh, just keep the touch, and they can be taken for either.' He was not, however, so particular in the case of architecture; and when Edinburgh, from St. Anthony's Chapel, was in hand, he sent me to the spot to make sketches of the principal buildings in the distance. The High School in Turner's drawing was little more than a white patch. Your father did the foreground, and I believe, the sheep, but St. Anthony's Chapel, and the various distant buildings were etched by me - the latter from the sketches I had taken. For closeness of line and minute detail, it is the most laborious plate I was ever engaged on, and will, I believe, bear looking at through a magnifier. Of course, the beautiful effects depend entirely on the finish of your father. I had only to do with the mechanical part - the body - the soul is his. In the case of Turner's figures, perhaps keeping the touch was carried too far."Your father usually etched the foreground of the plates his pupils worked upon; and was fond of etching water, both rough and smooth, which was remarkable for its liquid effect."Turner's touched proofs were always an object of interest in the workroom. I recollect on the margin of one of them he had written. 'Mr Miller will please return all my touched proofs.' Whether this was done I cannot say; but they are generally considered the property of the engraver. They must be of considerable value." ...|$|E

40|$|Cambridge University Press 2015. Until {{the early}} nineteenth century, all book and print {{production}} processes {{in all parts of}} the world succeeded or failed as a result of manual labour. Hands, not powered machines, engraved wood blocks and plates, cut punches and cast, composed and inked type. Hands worked paper mills and different kinds of xylography and letter-press, using many different sorts of material. Hands hung drying paper and silk, and bound the products. Across Europe, men and women lived and often suffered from the making of lead-based type and rag-based paper and from the exertions of pulling the letter- and <b>rolling</b> <b>presses.</b> Many operatives worked in small, hot and unpleasant printing rooms. In all parts of the world, eyes as well as hands suffered from the demands of microscopic cutting and refining of wood blocks and copper and other metal plates. Unlike the coming of print (wood blocks in second-century East Asia and thirteenth-century Europe; moveable type in eleventh-century China and fifteenth-century Europe), the second mechanized, industrial revolution in book production was experienced worldwide in one century. It was, nonetheless, hugely variable in its regional adoption and impact. This nineteenth-century transformation has been identified with publishing capitalism, and yet its history is many-faceted, with complicated antecedents. Technological bravura led the revolution, its products sometimes dismissed as industrial literature. Thomas Carlyle (and cultural pessimists around the globe) denounced the new machinery as mechanizing minds, devaluing literature and learning, and replacing craftsmanship (in writing as well as in publishing) by the robotic and the mass-produced.

In the construction industry, both structural and non-structural elements are created from thin gauges of sheet steel. The material thicknesses for such thin-walled steel members usually range from 0.0147 ¬†in. (0.373 ¬†mm) to about ¬º¬†in. (6.35 ¬†mm). Steel plates and bars as thick as 1 ¬†in. (25.4 ¬†mm) can also be cold-formed successfully into structural shapes. These building materials encompass columns, beams, joists, studs, floor decking, built-up zs and other components.

5|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of milled coinage, hammered coinage, which resulted in a relatively crude product of irregular shape and size, predominated in European mints. In , an Augsburg goldsmith named Max Schwab created a new technique for striking coins, which included the use of <b>rolling</b> mills, <b>presses</b> to cut the coinage blanks and the coinage press. After learning about the invention via the French ambassador, King Henry II dispatched the Comptroller of Finance Guillaume de Marillac and Fran√ßois Guilhem, Master of the Mint in Lyon, to observe the machinery. Schwab's press was turned with a weighted wooden handle, which exerted even pressure across the coinage blank, creating a sharper and more precise strike than hammering. De Marillac requested that Anne de Montmorency send him an engineer capable of creating a similar machine; he sent the engineer Aubin Olivier. Olivier viewed the machine, and introduced his own version to France, to which he later added a segmented collar. This allowed for the expanding metal to fill the collar, creating reeding, designs or edge lettering {{at the same time as}} the obverse and reverse images were struck onto the coin. The segments of the collar were then removed, and the coin ejected. Such lettering was used to aid in detecting coins which were debased by clipping metal from their edges, a problem frequently encountered in hammered coinage. Olivier's method of striking coins was considered costly relative to the previously utilised method, as the upper coinage die often came into contact with the collar on its downward descent, causing expensive damage. Milled coinage was thus abandoned in 1585 in favour of hammering.|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} digital games {{research}} can roughly {{be divided into}} three main areas, those of games research, player research and the applied research of games, which includes research into the design and development of games, {{as well as several}} other lines of inquiry like games 2 ÃÜ 7 policy issues or application of games into learning or multiplicity of other purposes. All of these three sub-fields are essential for understanding what games have been, what they currently are and mean for their players, what is in the games 2 ÃÜ 7 future, and why games are played in the first place. Neither are these perspectives mutually exclusive, but rather supportive, as they can complement each other in various ways. This paper is focused on the second of these three areas. There has been a relative bloom of games research that has focused on the definition and ontology of games, but its complementary part, that of research into the gameplay experience has not been adopted by academics in similar manner. Partly this is because of the disciplinary tilt among the current generation of ludologists: the background in either art, literary or media studies, or in the applied field of game design naturally leads into research where game, rather than player, is the focus of attention. Yet, the essence of a game is rooted in its interactive nature, and there is no game without a player. The act of playing game is where the rules embedded into game&# 146;s structure start operating, and its program code starts having an effect on cultural and social, as well as artistic and commercial realities. If we want to understand what a game is, we need to understand what happens in the act of playing, and we need to understand the player and the experience of gameplay. Gameplay {{is one of the more}} elusive concepts among games research, and also one of the most central ones. Looking at discourses of current digital game cultures, 2 ÃÜ 7 gameplay 2 ÃÜ 7 is used to describe the essential but elusive quality that defines the character of game as a game, the quality of its 2 ÃÜ 7 gameness 2 ÃÜ 7. In their book on game design, Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams decline to define the concept, because, according to them, gameplay is "the result of a large number of contributing elements" (Rollings & Adams 2003, 199). Yet, everyone who plays games long enough will form their own conception of bad or good gameplay, on the basis of their experience. This experience is informed by multiple significant game elements, which can be very different in games from different genres, as well as by their own abilities and preferences. This starting point can further be illustrated by a quote from Chris Crawford: I suggest that this elusive trait [game play] is derived from the combination of pace and cognitive effort required by the game. Games like TEMPEST have a demonic pace while games like BATTLEZONE have far more deliberate pace. Despite this difference, both games have good game play, for the pace is appropriate to the cognitive demands of the game. (Crawford 1982 / 1997, 21.) This definition actually translates 2 ÃÜ 7 gameplay 2 ÃÜ 7 into a particular, balanced relation between the level of challenge and the abilities of the player. Challenge consists of two main dimensions, the challenge of speed or 2 ÃÜ 7 pace 2 ÃÜ 7, and 2 ÃÜ 7 cognitive challenges 2 ÃÜ 7 on the other hand. The quality of gameplay is good when these various challenges are 2 ÃÜ 7 appropriate 2 ÃÜ 7 and in balance with regard to each other. On the other hand, one of the most influential theories of fun and creative action, the flow theory by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (1991), identifies the 2 ÃÜ 7 flow state 2 ÃÜ 7 as that particular successful balance of the perceived level of challenge and the skills of the person. In this highly intensive state one is fully absorbed within the activity, often loses one 2 ÃÜ 7 s sense of time and gains powerful gratification. Based on literature and our observations, gameplay experiences can reach this "optimal experience", but this kind of action-intensive flow is not necessarily a component of all satisfying game-playing experiences. The starting point of our research was the twofold perspective we gained in 2003 while interviewing children who actively played digital games alongside with their parents, who mostly did not play such games themselves (Ermi, Heli√∂ & M√§yr√§ 2004). Comparing notes, it became obvious that these young game players and their outside observers perceived the quality of gameplay experience differently. Parents expressed concern because they thought that their children became emotionally too intensely immersed, or too involved with the game fiction while playing. On the contrary, the interviewed children themselves thought that the emotional immersion and involvement in fiction was typically stronger for them while reading a good book or in watching a movie. But they admitted becoming often immersed in games, but in different ways as compared to immersion into literature or cinema, where emotional identification or engrossment was more common for them than in games. Curious about these different ways of perceiving game "immersion", we studied the responses further and analysed children 2 ÃÜ 7 s accounts of playing games and the different holding powers they had recognized in games in order to shed some light on the structure of the experience. The elements of game-related pleasures were first identified, and then organised into larger constellations; see Figure 1. Figure 1. Elements of game-related pleasures that emerged from the interviews of the children. In our full paper we will give a more detailed account on how the research was carried out in its different phases, as well as on how the derived model relates to other research traditions, such as the study of presence, as well as different forms of fun and pleasure in games and elsewhere. (Cf. e. g. Reeves & Nass 1996; Lombard & Ditton 1997; Douglas & Hargadon 2000, McMahan 2003, Hunicke, LeBlanc & Zubek 2004; Lazzaro 2004.) In this abstract we will just summarize some of the most central aspects of our approach. In our gameplay experience model (see Figure 2), gameplay is interaction between particular kind of game features and particular kind of game players. In order for this relationship to be successful, both sides of the equation must be mutually compatible. A relational interpretation of the fundamental nature of gameplay as this one has consequences on how games can be conceptualised; it makes no sense to declare a particular game good or bad in itself. This kind of qualitative claims must be contextualised by stating what kind of game player is used as a reference in the evaluation. In phenomenological terms, gameplay can be perceived in a temporal experience, which has three main aspects: the psycho-physiological responses, emotions and feelings, and finally the interpretation where player typically takes into account also other information, such as peer influence, game reviews and other frames of socio-cultural reference. Figure 2. Gameplay experience as interaction between the player, the game and the social context. The model identifies three fundamental components in the gameplay experience. These are sensory immersion, action-based immersion and mental immersion. In our paper, we will define each and provide examples on how these components are differently present while playing different kind of games. The social context and its effects on the interpretation of gameplay experience will also be discussed, as well as the application of the model into a tool for game evaluation and analysis.
