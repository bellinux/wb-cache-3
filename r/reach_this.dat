5|$|The 1991–92 FA Cup third-round {{match between}} Wrexham and Arsenal was {{played at the}} Racecourse Ground, Wrexham on 4 January 1992.

5|$|A {{white dwarf}} is very hot when it forms, {{but because it}} has no source of energy, it will {{gradually}} radiate its energy and cool. This means that its radiation, which initially has a high color temperature, will lessen and redden with time. Over a very long time, a white dwarf will cool and its material will begin to crystallize (starting with the core). The star's low temperature means it will no longer emit significant heat or light, and {{it will become a}} cold black dwarf. Because the length of time it takes for a white dwarf to <b>reach</b> <b>this</b> state is calculated to be longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years), it is thought that no black dwarfs yet exist. The oldest white dwarfs still radiate at temperatures of a few thousand kelvins.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to <b>reach</b> <b>this</b> state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

In the film's fifth weekend, it set the Martin Luther King Day weekend record, grossing $54,401,446, and set a fifth-weekend record with a take of $42,785,612.

It was the fastest film to gross $600 million domestically, on its 47th day in theatres.|$|E

5|$|Following the 2006 World Cup, Kinský {{signed a}} {{contract}} extension {{to stay at the}} club for another three years. He was named the best goalkeeper of the Russian Football Premier League in 2007. He kept his 100th top division clean sheet in a match against Tomsk in September 2008, becoming the 17th Czech goalkeeper to <b>reach</b> <b>this</b> figure. In October 2008, Kinský was offered the chance to move to Chelsea to be the backup goalkeeper for Petr Čech, an offer which he rejected. In November 2010 Kinský played his 200th competitive match for the club. Before the last game of the 2010 season, he was presented with a football shirt with the number 201 on it, intended to represent the number of games he had played for the club. However, due to injury Kinský was unable {{to take part in the}} match, so 200 was his actual number of competitive appearances. He left Saturn upon the expiry of his contract in December 2010.|$|E
5|$|Goalkeepers {{should be}} wary of dummying, lob shots and skip or bounce shots. Dummying is where players fake shots, leading keepers {{to come out of}} the water too early. This can cause the goalkeeper to come up too early and have to go back down for energy. The lob shot is where a field player {{attempts}} to put the ball over where the goalkeeper's hands can <b>reach.</b> <b>This</b> usually happens either if the goalkeeper is out of position from the dummies or if they are too far out from the goal. The goalkeeper should swim back to try to block it, as it is nowhere near as fast as the power shot. The bounce or skip shot is where a player propels the ball at the water with enough force to make it bounce or skim along the water. It can take the goalkeeper by surprise as they cannot predict the direction the ball will go.|$|E
5|$|His plan in tatters, Howe {{responded by}} example, leading his {{flagship}} HMS Queen Charlotte towards the French line which was rapidly slipping {{ahead of the}} British, steering around the meandering Caesar as he did so. Queen Charlotte first attempted {{to break through the}} French between the sixth and seventh ships from the rear, but was unable to <b>reach</b> <b>this</b> gap and instead sailed between the fifth and sixth, raking the sixth ship Eole from close range. Bellerophon and Lord Hugh Seymour in Leviathan followed close behind the flagship. Both battleships attempted to cut between the subsequent French ships; Bellerophon successfully, Leviathan prevented by damage to her helm. This manoeuvre changed the course of the battle, as Howe's ships isolated and raked the Terrible, Tyrannicide, and Indomptable, forcing Villaret to either abandon his ships or sacrifice the weather gage to save them.|$|E

Later in the war, he was in favour keeping the 2nd Division in Italy {{to deal with what}} he considered to be the greater priority, the defeat of Germany, rather than have it be used against the Japanese.|$|E
