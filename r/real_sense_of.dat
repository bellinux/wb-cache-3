25|$|In The Culture of Narcissism, Christopher Lasch {{defines a}} narcissistic culture as one where every {{activity}} and relationship {{is defined by}} the hedonistic need to acquire the symbols of wealth, this becoming the only expression of rigid, yet covert, social hierarchies. It is a culture where liberalism only exists insofar as it serves a consumer society, and even art, sex and religion lose their liberating power. In such a society of constant competition, there can be no allies, and little transparency. The threats to acquisitions of social symbols are so numerous, varied and frequently incomprehensible, that defensiveness, as well as competitiveness, becomes a way of life. Any <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community is undermined—or even destroyed—to be replaced by virtual equivalents that strive, unsuccessfully, to synthesize a sense of community.|$|E

500|$|Kelly of Computer and Video Games {{found the}} story memorable, and IGN's Moriarty named {{it one of}} the game's {{standout}} features. PlayStation Official Magazines David Meikleham wrote that the pacing contributed to the improvement of the story, stating that there is [...] "a <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> time elapsed and journey traveled along every step of the way", and Destructoid's Jim Sterling lauded the game's suspenseful moments. Richard Mitchell of Joystiq found that the narrative improved the character relationships.|$|E

2500|$|Four {{weeks of}} gruelling {{rehearsal}} resulted in Starfish, {{which focused on}} capturing the band's core sound. Bright, spacious and uncluttered, the recording was {{a departure from the}} layered orchestrations of Heyday. The group wanted as live and dynamic an album as possible, Willson-Piper said that trying to record a live atmosphere lacked a <b>real</b> gig's <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> [...] "being there". They found the results bare and simplistic; however, the public reception was unexpected.|$|R
500|$|Replay DVD was commended in {{reviews for}} the quality of the disc. DVD Times reports that [...] "Joking Apart looks much sharper than the average {{television}} show on DVD. The colours are also much richer and have obviously been fixed throughout to present a more uniform image while the picture is bright and clear." [...] The featurette on the series1 set is labelled [...] "a great little feature", with Moffat particularly praised for his contribution.

500|$|Regarding Madonna's {{influence}} on the record industry and younger artists, Debbie Gibson's then manager Doug Breitbart commented: [...] "Madonna has brought back a really strong, melodic component to pop music. She has a very youth-oriented, up, bubbly, fun sound." [...] Slant Magazine listed the album at number 60 on their list of [...] "The 100 Best Albums of the 1980s" [...] and stated that [...] "True Blue was the album on which it became readily apparent that Madonna {{was more than just}} a flash-in-the-pan pop star." [...] They added, [...] "It's when she began manipulating her image—and her audience—with a <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> clarity and purpose and made sure she had quality songs to back up her calculation and world-dominating ambition." ...|$|E
500|$|In his biographical sketch for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Philip Williamson depicts Bondfield as [...] "physically {{short and}} stout... with {{sparkling}} eyes, a firm, brisk manner, and effective, sometimes inspired, public speaking". She had the self-confidence to exist and thrive in a male-dominated world, deriving inspiration from a childhood that, though materially impoverished, her obituarist has described as [...] "of great spiritual and mental wealth". She inherited a strong nonconformist faith, {{which became a}} key element throughout her later career, and retained her links with the Congregational Church throughout her life. After her death The Times praised her [...] "unusually wide human sympathies... her generous nature and <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour". Skidelsky, however, describes her unsympathetically as [...] "a humourless and somewhat priggish person, with long black skirts and a voice that emitted a harsh cascade of sound".|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} {{a method for}} obtaining singlepath phase delays from GPS double differences. The resulting "zem differences " (ZDs) {{can be used for}} remote <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> atmospheric water vapor. The method is demonstrated by simulating and observing atmospheric delay gmdients. and by comparing ZDs with pointed radiometer observations of integrated water vapor along GPS ray paths. In-situ GPS antenna phase center and multi path effect.; are mapped in ZD residuals for a specific site and network. We conclude that ZDs derived from GPS network data show promise for <b>real</b> time <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> water vapor for use in meteorological modeling and forecasting...|$|R
60|$|That {{evening was}} in a very <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> a parting <b>of</b> the ways for me. To refuse this call was to go selfishly and comfortably {{along the lines of}} {{literary}} activity I had chosen. To accept was to enter the arena where problems of economic justice were being sternly fought out. I understood already something of the disadvantage which attached to being called a reformer, but my <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> duty and the influence of Herbert Spencer and Walt Whitman rose above my doubts. I decided to do my part.|$|R

500|$|Based {{on their}} success with {{producers}} Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois on The Unforgettable Fire, U2 wanted the duo to produce their new album. Mullen {{was excited about}} working with them again, as he felt the pair, Lanois in particular, were the band's first producers who [...] "really [...] {{an interest in the}} rhythm section". Mark [...] "Flood" [...] Ellis was selected to be the recording engineer for the sessions, marking the first time he worked with U2. The band were impressed by his work with Nick Cave, and Bono's friend Gavin Friday recommended Flood based on their work experiences together when Friday {{was a member of the}} Virgin Prunes. The band asked Flood for a sound that was [...] "very open... ambient... with a <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> space of the environment you were in", which he thought was a very unusual request at that time.|$|E
500|$|Dan Martin of The Guardian singles out {{the scene}} where Gwen and Rhys become stowaways in Children of Earth as [...] "just lovely" [...] and [...] "a credit to both actors, {{particularly}} Kai Owen, who has finally made Rhys likable", whilst IGN writer Asham Haque also feels that Rhys' [...] "meatier role" [...] provides [...] "some great sequences" [...] for the couple. Rawson-Jones speaks favourably on Owen's role in the overall ensemble opining that he, along with Barrowman, Myles and David-Lloyd managed to guide the audience through the serial with [...] "panache and verve". The Chicago Tribune Maureen Ryan feels that the initiated Rhys {{is key to the}} show, and is a [...] "very enjoyable character", describing his appeal to government PA Lois Habiba to pay for his and Gwen's dinner as [...] "priceless". Speaking of the show's fourth series premiere, Simon Brew highlights the central returning trio of Barrowman, Myles and Owen as the show's most engaging actors, and further describes Owen's performance as mixing [...] "humour with an earnest, and a <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> drive".|$|E
500|$|Tracks on {{this album}} include [...] "E Pari Ra", [...] "One Fine Day", [...] "Let Me Lie", [...] "Danny Boy", and [...] "Abide with Me". Westenra co-wrote four of the fifteen tracks, and the album also {{features}} singer Humphrey Berney. The US/Australia/NZ edition followed in March under the name Celtic Treasure. Westenra dedicated the album to her grandmother, Shirley Ireland. Inside the sleeve of the British edition, she wrote: [...] "I come from a musical family, and one with a <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> history. My forefathers were on the maiden voyage from Ireland to Christchurch, New Zealand in 1850 – there's even a commemoration plaque in Cathedral Square, Christchurch, which bears the name Westenra. My grandmother used to sit me on her knee and sing songs like Danny Boy from as early as I can remember. A singer herself in her earlier years, {{she has always been}} a never-ending source of songs. It's this legacy of music that she's been passing down to me since my childhood, and it's many of these beautiful old songs that I've explored here on my album." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} tended to be mixed. Noel Murray from The Onions The A.V. Club graded the episode with a D+, writing that [...] "Unlike the {{previous}} two weeks’ episodes, which juggled a number of storylines and locations and generated a <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> Fringe’s expanding milieu, 'Fracture' is so curtailed that it almost feels like it was made for the Fox accountants. The cast is small, the sets are few, and not much happens. The plot’s practically twist-free, until the very end. Large chunks {{of the episode}} are given over to Peter talking to Walter about finding a new {{place for them to}} live, and Walter trying to learn more about Astrid—and really not discovering much, except that she doesn’t like it when he experiments on fruit. So Astrid’s underused yet again, even in an episode where she gets a lot of lines... The story's too simple and the acting too broad, and yet the episode still felt choppy, as though the Fringe creative team had to scramble to fix 'Fracture' in post." ...|$|E
500|$|Heller was {{responsible}} for writing the episode's voice-over, despite his dislike of the task. He said that despite it being his [...] "400th version," [...] he was [...] "still not happy with it." [...] He believed that an early scene in which spoils are distributed from a cart in front of Pompey represented the first <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> how the series would depict city life. He said, [...] "I {{think this is the}} first time that we get sense of the version of Rome that the show is pushing," [...] which was a very different version than viewers may have been used to. To him, Rome was [...] "colorful and painted" [...] and cosmopolitan. A later scene featuring Cicero the Younger in the Senate proved difficult to film because of the large number of Italian extras who did not speak English. In the DVD audio commentary, he said that [...] "this is one of those scenes where you need really great assistant directors, because all of these Italian extras who have no idea whatsoever what [...] saying, so to keep them interested and focused and concentrated on what's going on is a real trick." ...|$|E
500|$|Destructoids Chris Carter commended Ashly Burch and Lance Reddick {{for their}} performances, with the {{character}} of Aloy receiving credit for maintaining a [...] "captivating" [...] and [...] "interesting" [...] consistency in the narrative and action sequences. Carter also lauded the focus on exploration and discovery, which he said grew more effective as he traversed more of the land. The game world itself was subject to compliment for its [...] "beautiful" [...] day-night cycle and weather system. According to Carter, the challenging nature of the machines and varied methods with which to battle them brought a <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> fun to the combat. Matt Buchholtz of Electronic Gaming Monthly likewise praised Burch {{as well as the}} game world, which he found to be mesmerising. Thought as the most powerful part of the game, the Focus feature gained approval for complementing the combat in a way that [...] "forces you to become a hunter". Writing for Game Informer, Jeff Marchiafava opined that, unlike with other open world video games, searching for audio logs and emails provided the plot with a [...] "remarkable sense of discovery". He was thankful that story-based missions dominated the overall experience, arguing that they worked to detail the game world and inspired variation in the gameplay.|$|E
5000|$|It {{should be}} {{recognized}} that 'Equanimity' does not refer {{to a state of}} mind, rather in Vedanta it describes the <b>real</b> nature.

40|$|Folbre's 'structures of constraint' {{analysis}} treats {{women as}} socially embedded in 'multiple, often contradictory positions, because {{they belong to}} multiple groups'. This paper addresses the problem of women's multiple collective identities by arguing that Sen's capability framework offers a means of explaining how women can maintain coherent personal identities. Using Sen's <b>real</b> opportunities <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> capabilities, the paper argues that women can acquire personal identities apart from their multiple collective identities if they acquire the specific capability of being able, freely and successfully, to negotiate their multiple group involvements. Folbre's list of policies for a more egalitarian family is reconsidered from this perspective. ...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{present a}} {{chemical}} sensor {{scheme based on}} selective sensing surfaces and highly sensitive integrated optical transduction methods. Using self-assembly techniques, species selective thin-films are covalently attached {{to the surface of}} Si{sub 3 }N{sub 4 } channel waveguides to produce robust sensor elements. Exposure to targeted analytes results in the selective absorption of these molecules onto the waveguide surface causing a change in the effective index of the guided modes. These relative changes in effective index between TE and TM modes are precisely measured using Zeeman interferometry.

500|$|The game's {{aesthetics}} {{were strongly}} praised. One reviewer appreciated {{the variety of}} styles in the music; it {{has been compared to}} Yanni, Enya, John Tesh, and sci-fi scores. Alan Dang contrarily found the music at times [...] "neutral" [...] and generic; Paul Ward found it pleasant but sparse. Numerous critics praised the voice acting and dialogue. The game's cinematic cutscenes were also acclaimed; Computer and Video Games noted they were [...] "superbly used for laughs or to create a <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> dramatic tension", while Next Generation wrote that Anachronox would be remembered as the germination point for blending interactive gaming and cinema. The Guardian, while also giving praise, found them somewhat predictable. Several reviewers praised the field map and level design of all but the last levels. Earlier ones were said to contain many [...] "little details that bring the game to life" [...] and significant immersion. The later levels were less well received, with one reviewer suspecting that ION Storm ran out of time to polish the game, as some end-game locations were [...] "hideously ugly, with huge slab-like polygons, dodgy backdrops and pixelated low resolution textures". The Guardian felt the lighting was too dark in general, while Kevin Cheung of The Sydney Morning Herald found the graphics blocky.|$|E
500|$|The {{position}} in the future empire of the Frisians, another Germanic people, was discussed on 5 April 1942 in one of Hitler’s many wartime dinner-conversations. Himmler commented that there was ostensibly no <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> community between the different indigenous {{ethnic groups in the}} Netherlands. He then stated that the Dutch Frisians in particular seemed to hold no affection for being part of a nation-state based on the Dutch national identity, and felt a much greater sense of kinship with their German Frisian brethren across the Ems River in East Frisia, an observation Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel agreed with based on his own experiences. Hitler determined that the best course of action in that case would be to unite the two Frisian regions {{on both sides of the}} border into a single province, and would at a later point in time further discuss the topic with Arthur Seyss-Inquart, the governor of the German regime in the Netherlands. By late May of that year these discussions were apparently concluded, as on the 29th he pledged that he would not allow the West-Frisians to remain part of Holland, and that since they were [...] "part of the exact same race as the people of East Frisia" [...] had to be joined into one province.|$|E
500|$|Alpha Centauri's turn-based gameplay, {{including}} the technology trees and factional warfare, was commonly compared to Civilization and Civilization II. The Adrenaline Vault's Pete Hines said, [...] "While Alpha Centauri is the evolutionary off-spring to [...] and , {{it is not}} [...] in space. Although the comparison is inevitable because of the lineage, it is still short-sighted." [...] Edge in 2006 praised [...] "Alpha Centauri’s greater sophistications as a strategy game." [...] IGN said [...] "Alpha Centauri is a better game than Civilization II; it's deep, rich, rewarding, thought-provoking in almost every way." [...] Game Revolution's reviewer was less magnanimous, saying [...] "Alpha Centauri {{is at least as}} good a game as Civilization 2. But it is its great similarity that also does it the most detriment. Alpha Centauri simply does not do enough that is new; it just doesn't innovate enough to earn a higher grade." [...] The ability to create custom units was praised, as was the depth of the tech tree. The artificial intelligence of computer-controlled factions, which featured adaptability and behavioral subtlety, was given mixed comments; some reviewers thought it was efficient and logical, while others found it confusing or erratic. Edge was disappointed in the game's diplomacy, finding [...] "no more and no less than is expected from the genre" [...] and unhappy with [...] "the inability to sound out any <b>real</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> relationship or rational discourse." ...|$|E

Prior Work: We are trying to build a juridical concept of responsibility and accountability taking into considerations the <b>real</b> and complete <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> this concept and this is way our study include materials that are not only from the legal field creating a multidisciplinary article. Approach: Our approach is consisting on observations, analysis, doctrinal research and cases studies. Results: The results of this study have both practical and theoretical applications. The theoretical application is representing by the fact that we establish the <b>real</b> and modern <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> terms as responsibility and accountability, including the relation between this concepts and the states and the practical one is representing by the conclusions concerning the implications of lack of responsibility or lack of accountability expressed into court orders. Implications: The implications of the study area include academics, researchers, institutions and state. Value: This study establishing the theoretical and practical meanings of concepts as responsibility and liability, is underlining the subjects of this concepts and the legal need to have a simple and clear procedure in order to ask and to obtain the responsibility or for the accountability of a juridical subject...|$|R
