40|$|The use {{of prior}} {{information}} on supply elasticities to calibrate programming models of agricultural supply has been advocated {{repeatedly in the}} recent literature (Heckelei and Britz 2005). Yet, Mérel and Bucaram (2009) {{have shown that the}} dual goal of calibrating such models to a <b>reference</b> <b>allocation</b> while replicating an exogenous set of supply elasticities is not always feasible. This article lays out the methodological foundation to exactly calibrate programming models of agricultural supply using generalized CES production functions. We formally derive the necessary and sufficient conditions under which such models can be calibrated to replicate the <b>reference</b> <b>allocation</b> while displaying crop-specific supply responses that are consistent with prior information. When it exists, the solution to the exact calibration problem is unique. From a microeconomic perspective, the generalized CES model is preferable to quadratic models that have been used extensively in policy analysis since the publication of Howitt’s (1995) Positive Mathematical Programming. The two types of specifications are also compared {{on the basis of their}} flexibility towards calibration, and it is shown that, provided myopic calibration is feasible, the generalized CES model can calibrate larger sets of supply elasticities than its quadratic counterpart. Our calibration criterion has relevance both for calibrated positive mathematical programming models and for “well-posed” models estimated through generalized maximum entropy following Heckelei and Wolff (2003), where it is deemed appropriate to include prior information regarding the value of own-price supply elasticities.

40|$|Hybrid power {{production}} facilities, {{based on the}} integration of renewable resources into conventional fossilfuel- fired power plants have gained a growing interest during the past decades due to a world-wide continuous increase of shares of the renewable sources into the electricity generation market. In fact, {{in spite of the}} variable nature of most of the renewable sources, the hybrid configuration may provide a more economic, sustainable, and reliable use of the renewables in all load-demand conditions compared to renewable singleresource facilities. Nonetheless, the question of what fraction of the electricity produced in such facilities is to be considered as generated from renewables, still remains not fully addressed. This implies that there is space for some arbitrariness in the quantification of the share of the produced electricity to be qualified for the subsidies granted to renewable electricity, as normally prescribed by most of the policies that promote the applications of renewable primary energy resources. To overcome this problem, in this work we first define the classical Single-Resource Separate-Production <b>Reference</b> <b>allocation</b> method (SRSPR) usually considered by the regulators which is based on reference partial primary energy factors that must be chosen by some authority as representative of the performance of the (best available or representative average single-resource) {{power production}} technologies that use the same renewable resource and the same fossil fuel as the hybrid facility. Then we propose a Self-Tuned Average-Local- Productions <b>Reference</b> <b>allocation</b> method (STLAPR) whereby the electricity allocation fractions are based on the energy scenario of the local area of interest that includes the hybrid plant itself. We compare the two methods for a case study consisting on the renewable-to-fossil allocation of the power produced in an Solar-Integrated Combined-Cycle System (SICCS) with parabolic trough solar field. It turns out that the differences between the classical SRSPR and the STLAPR method become significant as the hybrid facilities take on a sizable fraction of the production of electricity in the local area...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{on a series of}} free-form {{bargaining}} experiments in which two players have to distribute four indivisible goods among themselves. In one treatment, players are informed about the monetary payoffs associated with each bundle of goods; in a second treatment only the ordinal ranking of the bundles is given. We find that in both cases, inequality aversion plays a prominent role. In the ordinal treatment, individuals apparently use the ranks in the respective preference orderings over bundles of goods as a substitute for the unknown monetary value. Allocations that distribute the value (money or ranks, respectively) most equally serve as natural "reference points" for the bargaining processes. Frequently, such "equal split" allocations are chosen by our subjects even though they are Pareto dominated. Whether a Pareto optimal allocation is chosen or not depends on {{whether or not it is}} a Pareto improvement relative to the "equal split" <b>reference</b> <b>allocation.</b> We find less Pareto-damaging behavior due to inequality aversion in the ordinal than in the cardinal treatment.

40|$|We present {{research}} results on sample allocations for efficient model-based small area estimation {{in cases where}} the areas of interest coincide with the strata. Although model-assisted and model-based estimation methods are common in the production of small area statistics, utilization of the underlying model and estimation method are rarely included in the sample area allocation scheme. Therefore, we have developed a new model-based allocation named g 1 -allocation. For comparison, one recently developed model-assisted allocation is presented. These two allocations are based on an adjusted measure of homogeneity which is computed using an auxiliary variable and is an approximation of the intra-class correlation within areas. Five model-free area allocation solutions presented in the past are selected from the literature as <b>reference</b> <b>allocations.</b> Equal and proportional allocations need the number of areas and area-specific numbers of basic statistical units. The Neyman, Bankier and NLP (Non-Linear Programming) allocation need values for the study variable concerning area level parameters such as standard deviation, coefficient of variation or totals.

Statistical properties of the various methods are assessed through sample simulation experiments using real population register data. It can be concluded from simulation results that inclusion of the model and estimation method into the allocation method improves estimation results...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} method for {{ensuring}} termination of λ-calculus wit references, {{that makes it possible}} to combine term rewriting measure-based techniques with traditional approaches for termination in functional languages such as logical relations. The method can be made parametric on the termination technique employed on the functional parts. 1 A λ-calculus with references 1. 1 Language and type system In this section, our technique is adapted to λref, a call-by-value λ-calculus extended with imperative operations (<b>reference</b> <b>allocation,</b> dereferencing, update) acting on a store. With respect to the π-calculus, intuitively, references correspond to imperative names, and functions to functional names. We transport the constraints for π-calculus onto the λ-calculus following this analogy. In λref certain level and typing annotations are directly placed into the syntax (this was not mandatory, but it simplifies certain technical details). The store is stratified into regions, which are referred to using natural numbers. Commands involving imperative operations are annotated by a natural number: a command acts on regions of a given level. To define terms, we use two disjoint sets V of variables, ranged over using x, y, z, [...] ., and A of addresses. Addresses are written u (n,T) : they are explicitly associated both to a region n and a type T (types are described below). Note that values of different types can be stored in the same region. We suppose that there exists an infinite number of addresses for a given pair of a type and a region. Stores, ranged over using δ, are partial mappings from addresses to values. The (finite) support of δ is written supp(δ), ∅ is the empty store (supp(∅) = ∅), and δ〈u (n,T) � V 〉 denotes the store δ ′ defined by δ ′ (u (n,T)) = V and δ ′ (v) = δ(v) for every v ∈ supp(δ) such that v ̸ = u (n,T). The syntax for terms, types, values, redexes and evaluation contexts is as follows: M:: = (M M) ∣ ∣ ∣ x λx. M ⋆ ∣ refn M ∣ derefn(M) ∣ M:=nM ∣ u (n,T) T:: = 1 ∣ T refn ∣ n T → T V:: = λx.

A mathematical program is developed to provide a comprehensive treatment of dynamic implications and their interactions with single-period effects. Then, special cases of the model are examined. The paper shows that these specific approaches contain dynamic counterparts of treatments which are used in static (single-period) formulations.

The bill would have put some of Alaska's vast federal land holdings under state control while preserving other portions for federal parks and refuges; the action would earn Gravel the enmity of fellow Alaska Senator Ted Stevens. In 1980, a new lands bill came up for consideration, that was less favorable to Alaskan interests and more liked by environmentalists; it set aside 127000000 acre of Alaska's 375000000 acre for national parks, conservation areas, and other restricted federal uses. Gravel blocked it, as not ensuring enough future development in the state. A new compromise version of the bill came forward, which reduced the land set aside to 104000000 acre. Gravel, in representation of Alaskan interests, tried to stop the bill, including staging a filibuster. The Senate, however, voted cloture and then passed the bill.

Consequently, allocation decisions rely on bureaucratic processes. Some other European countries have more socially diverse social rented sectors and make much greater use of price signals.

It has been suggested that Britain could adopt some of the organisational structures and practices used elsewhere and move away from the present 'command' system towards a 'social market'. Comparative evidence confirms that the British social rented sector does contain much greater concentrations of poor households and that this does not simply arise from the types of household housed in the sector. But further analysis of the distribution of income and work suggests that the divisions in the housing sector may primarily reflect these broader contextual divisions.

In a degraded situation, a reconfigured control allocation strategy is proposed based on on-line re-estimation of the actuator reliability. A benefit of incorporating reliability indicators into over-actuated control system design is the smart management of the redundant actuators and improvement of the system safety. Moreover, when the fault is severe, an adaptation approach using the reference governor is proposed. The reference governor unit is a reference-offset governor based on a discrete-time predictive control strategy. The idea is to modify the reference according to the system constraints, which become stricter after the occurrence of an actuator fault.
