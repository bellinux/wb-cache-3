5|$|Kosygin {{initiated}} the 1973 Soviet economic <b>reform</b> {{to enhance the}} powers and functions of the regional planners by establishing associations. The <b>reform</b> was never fully implemented; indeed, members of the Soviet leadership complained that the <b>reform</b> had not even begun {{by the time of}} the 1979 <b>reform.</b> The 1979 Soviet economic <b>reform</b> was initiated to improve the then-stagnating Soviet economy. The reform's goal was to increase the powers of the central ministries by centralising the Soviet economy to an even greater extent. This <b>reform</b> was also never fully implemented, and when Kosygin died in 1980 it was practically abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Tikhonov told the Soviet people at the 26th Party Congress that the <b>reform</b> was to be implemented, or at least parts of it, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985). Despite this, the <b>reform</b> never came to fruition. The <b>reform</b> is seen by several Sovietologists as the last major pre-perestroika <b>reform</b> initiative put forward by the Soviet government.|$|E
5|$|Although Robert {{refused to}} consecrate Spearhafoc, {{there is little}} {{evidence}} that he was interested in the growing movement towards Church <b>reform</b> being promulgated by the papacy. Pope Leo IX was beginning a <b>reform</b> movement later known as the Gregorian <b>Reform,</b> initially focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting simony. In 1049 Leo IX declared that he would take more interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them. It may have been partly to appease Leo that Edward appointed Robert instead of Æthelric, hoping to signal to the papacy that the English crown was not totally opposed to the growing <b>reform</b> movement. It was against this backdrop that Robert refused to consecrate Spearhafoc, although there is no other evidence that Robert embraced the <b>reform</b> position, and his claim that the pope forbade the consecration may have had more to do with finding an easy excuse than any true desire for <b>reform.</b> There are also some indications that Spearhafoc was allied to Godwin, and his appointment was meant as a quid pro quo for the non-appointment of Æthelric. If true, Robert's refusal to consecrate Spearhafoc would have contributed to the growing rift between the archbishop and the earl.|$|E

5|$|This later <b>reform</b> was presaged by a <b>reform</b> in {{the middle}} of the 1950s; the {{economic}} historian Jörg Roesler considers the NES in the 1960s as a continuation of this <b>reform.</b> The origin of the <b>reform</b> in the 1950s was a scientific study, commissioned by Rau's ministry in 1953, to assess the need for greater economic efficiency in the factories. The subsequent results from this study promised enhanced economic efficiency by shifting more responsibility from the National Planning Commission to the enterprises themselves. Thenceforward, already in spring 1954, Rau advocated such a planning <b>reform,</b> while planning boss Bruno Leuschner quite consistently opposed it. In August 1954, Rau's ministry sent a concept for such a <b>reform</b> to Leuschner's State Planning Commission. Eventually this <b>reform</b> got under way, after Ulbricht, perhaps under the influence of his new personal economic adviser Wolfgang Berger, had approved such a policy at the end of 1954 too. Subsequently, the <b>reform</b> accelerated until 1956. It found however its early end in the generally aggravated political atmosphere in 1957. Unrests in other Eastern Bloc countries during the previous year 1956, in particular in Hungary, had awoken the desire for more central control again. The subsequent unsatisfying economic development, however, during the following years eventually led in the 1960s to the concept of a new planning <b>reform,</b> the NES.|$|E
