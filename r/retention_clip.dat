50|$|The {{proximity}} pilot (or, plug presence) signal {{allows the}} EV to detect {{when it is}} plugged in. Inside the plug itself, a passive resistance is connected across PP and PE, which the EV then detects. PP does not connect between EV and EVSE. A plug with a closed <b>retention</b> <b>clip</b> is indicated by 480 Ω, and a plug with an open <b>retention</b> <b>clip</b> (i.e., pressed by the user) is indicated by 150 Ω. This allows the EV to inhibit movement while a charging cable is attached, and to cease charging as the plug is disconnected, {{so there is no}} load and associated arcing.|$|E
50|$|Hubcaps {{were first}} {{used on the}} Newton Reaction Carriage in 1680. The first hubcaps were more {{commonly}} known as dust or grease caps. These caps threaded onto the center hub on the wood, steel, or wire wheel. These were made {{from the beginning of}} car manufacturing to 1932. Pre-1915 hubcaps were all mostly made of brass that was nickel-plated. The 1920s hubcaps were mostly aluminum. Grease caps of the wire wheel brands such as Houk, Hayes, Frayer, Dayton, Buffalo, House, Phelps, Pasco, Rudge Whitworth, Budd, and Stewart are some of the hardest to find. When a customer went to buy the wire wheels, the make of the vehicle would be stamped in the center. During 1927 and 1928, the first snap-on center caps were being made on the wire wheels. After 1932, most every car had a snap-on style center cap on the middle of their wire, steel, or wood wheels. Wire wheel center caps in the 1930s had a spring-loaded <b>retention</b> <b>clip</b> system that has been used on many hubcaps and center caps on every style of car and truck to the present day.|$|E
50|$|Common sockets have <b>retention</b> <b>clips</b> {{that apply}} a {{constant}} force, {{which must be}} overcome when a device is inserted. For chips {{with a large number}} of pins, either zero insertion force (ZIF) sockets or land grid array (LGA) sockets are used instead. These designs apply a compression force once either a handle (for ZIF type) or a surface plate (LGA type) is put into place. This provides superior mechanical retention while avoiding the risk of bending pins when inserting the chip into the socket.|$|R
50|$|The next {{innovation}} in rack design {{has been the}} square-hole rack. Square-hole racks allow boltless mounting, such that the rack-mount equipment only needs to insert through and hook down into {{the lip of the}} square hole. Installation and removal of hardware in a square hole rack is very easy and boltless, where the weight of the equipment and small <b>retention</b> <b>clips</b> are all that is necessary to hold the equipment in place. Older equipment meant for round-hole or tapped-hole racks can still be used, with the use of cage nuts made for square-hole racks.|$|R
5000|$|Steel {{wheels in}} the 1930s had <b>retention</b> <b>clips</b> mounted {{to the wheel}} that snapped into a lip {{in the back of}} the cap. Wood wheels were a special option. The caps on these had a large chrome base that mushroomed up to another smaller chrome base that would have the emblem on the face. The [...] "stem" [...] up to the second base was usually painted black to make it look as if the top base was floating. These caps were usually made of brass, steel, or aluminum. During the mid-1930s the first full wheel covers were {{introduced}} to fit over the entire wheel, except for a small portion of the rim closest to the rubber tire.|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} was to present the {{clinical}} outcomes of the immediate loading of two bar-splinted implants retaining a mandibular overdenture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a clinical trial, 124 edentulous patients were treated according to a new treatment concept, which involves the immediate loading of two bar-splinted SLActive implants with an implant-retained mandibular overdenture. The new conventional mandibular denture is used as a template for implant positioning and as an impression tray, and for mounting the <b>retention</b> <b>clip</b> by the dental laboratory. At the same day the implants are placed, the conventional denture is converted into an implant-retained overdenture. During the healing and evaluation period, resonance frequency analysis (RFA) was undertaken to assess the effect of loading on implant stability and survival. RESULTS: The survival rate of the implants was 98. 8 % during the evaluation period (12 - 40 months). Only 3 of the 248 implants were lost. During the healing (osseointegration) phase, the implant-stability quotient increased significantly (p =. 0001). During the evaluation period, four patients (3 %) needed a relining of their mandibular overdenture, whereas 13 patients (11 %) needed relining of the maxillary denture. CONCLUSIONS: Two interconnected implants can be successfully loaded by a mandibular overdenture at the same day of implant placement with a high survival rate of the implants. Only a few patients needed additional relining of the overdenture. Repeated RFA measurements can be useful in gauging implant stability and survival...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of fully edentulous mandibles {{by means of}} implant-supported hinging overdentures has become a routine therapy, although long-term data on the success rate of implants and prostheses are lacking. This longitudinal study examined 207 consecutively treated patients who received, during the past 10 years, 449 Brånemark implants to retain a mandibular hinging overdenture, mainly on a Dolder bar. Clinical parameters and standardized radiographs taken at every recall visit with an interval of 6 - 12 months were used to judge the implant rigidity in the jawbone, the marginal bone level, and attachment level changes. The cumulative implant failure rate at 9 years was 3 %. After loading, implant loss was concentrated during the first 12 months, with only one failure observed at 22 months. A radiographically determined bone loss of 0. 7 mm was observed during the first year. From the second year, a mean annual bone loss of 0. 05 mm occurred. The attachment loss, calculated as the sum of probing pocket depth plus the recession, was 0. 07 mm/year and paralleled the changes in marginal bone level over time. The rigidity of the implant-bone interface revealed an increase over time, as shown by a decrease in Periotest values. The bar-overdenture complications were related to relining (23 %), untightening of the <b>retention</b> <b>clip</b> (10 %), and renewal of the prosthesis (7 %). When magnets or ball attachments were used, more aftercare was needed. Fracture of the antagonistic full denture occurred in 7 % of patients. The present data indicate that the mandibular overdenture therapy on two (Brånemark) implants is a very reliable and cost-effective treatment, even in a long-term perspective for the fixed full mandibular prosthesis and especially in elderly patients. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this {{clinical}} study was to evaluate the complications associated with the different attachments used in implant-supported overdentures, including prosthetic problems and implant failures. A comparison of ball, bar and Locator (Zest Anchors, Inc, homepage, Escondido, CA, USA) attachments, in completely edentulous patients with two, three or four implants, was conducted. Material and methods: A total of 36 edentulous patients (20 female, 16 male) {{with a mean age}} of 66. 3 years, were enrolled in the study. The patients were treated with 95 implants, for the prosthetic restoration of the maxilla or the mandible. The mean follow-up time was 41. 17 months. Prosthetic complications including, fractured overdentures, replacements of O-ring attachment and <b>retention</b> <b>clips,</b> implant failures, hygiene problems, mucosal enlargements, attachment fractures, retention loss and dislodgement of the attachments were recorded and evaluated. The recall visits at 3, 6, 12 months and, annually thereafter. Results: Fourteen complications in the ball attachment group and 7 complications in the bar group were observed. No complications were observed in the locator group. The difference was found to be as statistically significant (p= 0, 009). Six of the 95 implants had failed. Totally 39 implant overdentures were applied. Three prostheses were renewed because of fractures. Conclusion: Within the limits of the present study, it was concluded that the locator system showed superior clinical results than the ball and the bar attachments, with regard to the rate of prosthodontic complications and the maintenance of the oral function. © Medicina Oral S.

40|$|Antigen {{presentation}} by tumor {{cells in the}} context of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) is generally considered to be a prerequisite for effective immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We evaluated cell surface HLA class I, HLA class II and cytoplasmic HLA-DM staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 389 classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHL), 22 nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin lymphomas (NLPHL), 137 diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), 39 primary central nervous system lymphomas (PCNSL) and 19 testicular lymphomas. We describe a novel mechanism of immune escape in which loss of HLA-DM expression results in aberrant membranous invariant chain peptide (CLIP) expression in HLA class II cell surface positive lymphoma cells, preventing presentation of antigenic peptides. In HLA class II positive cases, HLA-DM expression was lost in 49 % of cHL, 0 % of NLPHL, 14 % of DLBCL, 3 % of PCNSL and 0 % of testicular lymphomas. Considering HLA class I, HLA class II and HLA-DM together, 88 % of cHL, 10 % of NLPHL, 62 % of DLBCL, 77 % of PCNSL and 87 % of testicular lymphoma cases had abnormal HLA expression patterns. In conclusion, an HLA expression pattern incompatible with normal antigen presentation is common in cHL, DLBCL, PCNSL and testicular lymphoma. <b>Retention</b> of <b>CLIP</b> in HLA class II caused by loss of HLA-DM is a novel immune escape mechanism, especially prevalent in cHL. Aberrant HLA expression should be taken into account when evaluating efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in B-cell lymphomas...|$|R
40|$|The {{system of}} bars with <b>clip</b> <b>retention</b> {{consists}} on using both implants with their prosthetic cylinders. The present work shows this system as studied evaluating the passive marginal adaptation, {{both in the}} vertical, and the horizontal direction. Two kinds of material were evaluated, calcic and metallic manufactured in mono block or separated to be joined later through laser welding. Four groups were formed, comparing the kind of material with or without welding, totalizing 792 points of measuring. About the kind of material utilized, there wasn¿t a meaningful signifi cance between the groups. However, when using welting, there was a meaningful statistical difference (p< 0. 05), with horizontal average values of 213. 15 m on the mono blocks and 138. 51 m, on the welding ones. It was found, then in the vertical sense, the average values of 378, 77 m on the mono blocks and 174. 23 m on the welding ones...|$|R
5000|$|In 1956, {{the company}} made the Jotter barrel smooth plastic and changed the clip to the [...] "21" [...] style. This clip used a {{reversed}} [...] "V" [...] rather than an inverted one and incorporated a ball on the <b>clip</b> for pocket <b>retention.</b> This <b>clip</b> remained in use for approximately two years. During the period this variation was in production a metal barrel end (or tip) was added in response to complaints that the early plastic tip broke from pressure. Examples without the metal tip and the [...] "21" [...] clip are relatively rare. There are also some examples of the grooved nylon barrel being mated to the [...] "21" [...] clip and the inverted clip being mated to smooth barrels without tips. One can only conjecture {{that this was an}} {{effort on the part of}} the factory to use up surplus parts from different series. Barrels and caps were all interchangeable during this period. and 3rd edition barrels (c. 1963 up) have been found fitted to the [...] "21" [...] caps because of the ease of attaching them. These barrels are of slightly smaller diameter. Collectors have added these incorrect barrels because they were manufactured in several colors unavailable at the time. These colors demand higher prices for this edition of the Jotter. Before acquiring a [...] "21" [...] mode, one should establish that the attached barrel is the larger diameter if concerned about accuracy and authenticity. It is suggested that the collector should acquire a sample of both sized refills and test the inside diameter of the barrel. The newer and more colorful barrels will not accept the larger diameter refills.|$|R
40|$|Tumor cell {{survival}} and immune escape mechanisms in classical Hodgkin lymphoma The nature of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), {{a minority of}} tumor cells in a reactive background and loss of B cell phenotype, decides its dependence on the microenvironment for signals to contribute to {{survival and}} proliferation {{while at the same}} time trying to escape an anti-tumor response especially fired up because of the presence of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) in the tumor cells. The data in this thesis show involvement of new players in the survival of the tumor cells in HL and their escape from anti-tumor immune responses. In addition to known pathways that are aberrantly activated in the tumor cells, aberrant expression of Insulin-like growth factor- 1 receptor (IGF- 1 R), Ephrin family members and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) might provide additional signals leading to the survival and growth of the tumor cells. Despite the oncogenic effect of IGF- 1 R in cell lines, IGF- 1 R expression in the tumor cells of primary cases predicts a favorable outcome. The wide expression of Ephrin family members both in the tumor cells and the microenvironment suggests that there is a role for the Ephrin family in the pathogenesis of HL. Similarly, the expression of TLRs by the tumor cells supports a role in HL pathogenesis, although the effect of triggering of TLRs on HL cell lines was limited. In terms of immune escape, potential mechanisms involve lack of functional antigen expressing, such as downregulation of HLA class I and II, and <b>retention</b> of <b>CLIP,</b> by loss of HLA-DM, in HLA class II molecules impairing antigen presentation in HL. In undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma, another EBV associated cancer, HLA class I and II downregulation was observed in part of the cases. The expression of HLA class II was strongly correlated to HLA-DM and HLA-DO expression, suggesting interference of HLA-DO with the function of HLA-DM, leading to expression of CLIP and impaired antigen presentation...|$|R
