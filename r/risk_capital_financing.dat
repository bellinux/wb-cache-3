40|$|As the OECD {{is celebrating}} its 50 th anniversary, member {{countries}} are exiting from the biggest post-war financial and economic crisis {{and are trying to}} put their economies back onto strong, sustainable footing. While financial reforms should provide for a better, more sustainable balance between stability and growth, measures to strengthen the savings-investment channel should foster sustainable growth and development. These issues were explored at a High-Level OECD Financial Roundtable and are summarised in this article. Covered are the topics of financial reform to foster stability and long-term growth, the contribution of institutional investors to long-term growth, and creating a better environment for the financing of business innovation and green growth. With strained public sector finances, private capital needs to fill the funding gap for infrastructure and other long-term projects. Appropriate regulatory incentives to overcome short-termism, as well as risk-sharing arrangements e. g. via publicprivate partnerships, are needed in order to encourage market-based, long-term investment and <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> <b>financing.</b> Better transparency, information and investor education can also play a role in enhancing long-term savings and investment. ...|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of financing for small businesses and two common financing options mentioned in the study, bank loans and Venture Capital. Venture Capital {{is a form of}} <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> <b>financing,</b> investing in unlisted stock market. The feature of the arrangement is that those people are trying to find companies that can offer unique, attractive and in demand products on a strong growing market. Since VC-firms are taking a big risk in cooperation with the investment, the VC-company strong demands while assessments are made on the company will generate a return in the future. Bank loans are {{the most common form of}} financing for companies in the market. Requirements and assessment under the law is hard especially for small businesses because financing entails high risks. Banks require that the liquidity management in the enterprise should be stable because the bank's main objective is to repayment of debt and the interest payable on the capital. The purpose of this study is to examine the requirements and assessments VC-firms and banks make use of the financing of small businesses. ...|$|E

Venture Capitalists (VCs) seem to {{play a crucial role}} in achieving product and service innovation. Young entrepreneurs particularly face the problem of financial constraints if starting their business, and <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> could be their sole solution. However, the level of early-stage venture capital (VC) investments across European countries differ profoundly. I employ a panel analysis to illustrate whether technical and innovative opportunities as well as entrepreneurial environment influence early-stage venture capital investments. In addition, I emphasize the role of the financial system in attracting early stage VC. The empirical analysis was conducted in 15 European countries and looked at the period from 1995 to 2005. The results show that technical and innovation opportunities as well as entrepreneurial environment influence the level of early-stage <b>risk</b> <b>capital.</b> Taking the financial system also into account, the analysis revealed that a bank-based system has a negative impact on the relative amount of early stage VC investments, as a market-based system attracts <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> for young entrepreneurs.

5000|$|In free-market economies, {{technological}} advances lead {{to increases in}} productivity, but {{at the expense of}} older, less-efficient means of production, creating a level of subjective risk for which the compensation (in theory) is the return on capital. This rate or return is a reflection of all of the perceived risks associated with the <b>capital</b> <b>financing</b> of the means of production, including technology <b>risks.</b> From a <b>capital</b> <b>finance</b> point of view, advances in technology are the classic definition of systemic market risk. The outflow of this condition is the [...] "creative destruction" [...] of a portion of the means of production as evidenced by businesses discontinuing the production of obsolete products and/or the cessation of business activities that are no longer profitable. In its purest form, capitalism entails a constant level of creative destruction of a portion of the means of production and the increase in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the subject economy reflects the growth after the losses due to economic obsolescence have been reconciled. Accordingly, increases in GDP provides a substantive measurement that demonstrates that capitalism does not in effect create an economic construct where one party can only make a gain {{at the expense of the}} other party (i.e.: if one party could only profit at the expense of another party, then it would be impossible to achieve any nominal growth in GDP).|$|R

To resolve the paradoxes, we introduce a non-neoclassical model which features financial contracts and firm heterogeneity. In our model, free patterns of gross capital flow emerge {{as a function of the}} quality of the financial system and the level of protection for property rights(i. e., the risk of expropriation. A poor country with an inefficient financial system but a low expropriation risk may simultaneously experience an outflow of financial capital but an inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI), resulting in a small net flow.

We show that while the degree of loss aversion is key in determining the market price of risk, the convexity/concavity of the value function is much less important in this respect. The theoretical relationship obtained is tested empirically by using international data from 16 different countries during over 100 years, as documented by Dimson et al. [Triumph of the Optimists: 101 Years of Global Investment Returns, 2002 (Princeton University Press) ]. The empirical data yield an estimate of λ= 2. 3 for the loss aversion index.

40|$|Despite the {{achievements}} attained {{in recent years}} in the economic development of Latvia, until now Latvia’s regions demonstrate uneven development, which negatively impacts the development of small business. The authors of the article, {{based on the results of}} the research conducted by the staff of the National Regional Development Agency, the Ministry of Economics, as well as the results of research conducted with the participation of the authors of this article, present an analysis of the causes hampering the development of small enterprises in the regions of Latvia. The main factors hampering their development are: lack of qualified staff, inability of the educational system to adequately meet the requirements of particular branches, and insufficiently rapid introduction of up-to-date technologies. Solution of these problems has to contribute to the development of the regional innovative environment. The development of regional higher educational establishments in Latvia will contribute to the enhancement of competitiveness of regional economies with a focus on science-intensive enterprises.

40|$|Summary. [...] The {{success with}} which middle-income indebted eveloping {{countries}} have {{gained access to}} private international finance in the 1990 s {{is a tribute to}} their own domestic economic performance, international policy in dealing with the debt crisis of the 1980 s, and innovations in international financial markets. This paper emphasizes the role of private infrastructure investment as a vehicle for attracting foreign capital to developing countries in the 1990 s. The paper examines the determination of credit risk premium on infrastructure projects in the country risk environment of developing countries, and provides tentative quantitative evidence of the importance ofmacroeconomic and project-specific attributes of project risk. The key finding is that the market seems to impose a high risk premium on loans to countries with high inflation, and to projects in the road sector. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.
