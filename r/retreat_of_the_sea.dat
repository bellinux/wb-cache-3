60|$|Lima {{stands on}} a plain in a valley, formed during the gradual <b>retreat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> It is seven miles from Callao, and is {{elevated}} 500 feet above it; but from the slope being very gradual, the road appears absolutely level; so that when at Lima {{it is difficult to}} believe one has ascended even one hundred feet: Humboldt has remarked on this singularly deceptive case. Steep barren hills rise like islands from the plain, which is divided, by straight mud-walls, into large green fields. In these scarcely a tree grows excepting a few willows, and an occasional clump of bananas and of oranges. The city of Lima is now in a wretched state of decay: the streets are nearly unpaved; and heaps of filth are piled up in all directions, where the black gallinazos, tame as poultry, pick up bits of carrion. The houses have generally an upper story, built, on account of the earthquakes, of plastered woodwork; but some of the old ones, which are now used by several families, are immensely large, and would rival in suites of apartments the most magnificent in any place. Lima, the City of the Kings, must formerly have been a splendid town. The extraordinary number of churches gives it, even at the present day, a peculiar and striking character, especially when viewed from a short distance.|$|E

40|$|Glaciation {{should now}} {{be treated as a}} {{regularly}} repetitive process, not as an irregular process through geologic time.

40|$|The Late Cenozoic East Asian {{winter monsoon}} (EAWM) {{enhancement}} has {{been attributed to}} several factors, such as uplift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tibetan Plateau, <b>retreat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Paratethys <b>Sea,</b> and global cooling related to polar ice volume increment. However, the fundamental forcing factors remain enigmatic due to <b>the</b> absence <b>of</b> long and continuous climate records and sensitive indicators. Here we reanalyzed the published grain-size record of Sikouzi fine sediments in the western Chinese Loess Plateau through end-member (EM) modeling. The results indicate that EM 2 with grain-size peaks between 10 - 100 μm decreased in content from 20. 1 to 17 Ma and stepwise increased from 17 to 0. 07 Ma during the following six stages (17 - 15 Ma, 15 - 12 Ma, 12 - 8 Ma, 8 - 6 Ma, 6 - 4 Ma and 4 - 0 Ma). Such varying trends can be successively correlated in seven stages with the integrated benthic δ 18 O record, implying that global warming weakened the EAWM from 20. 1 to 17 Ma and global cooling has stepwise strengthened the EAWM since 17 Ma. Therefore, we conclude that global temperature change played a major role on <b>the</b> evolution <b>of</b> EAWM during <b>the</b> Neogene period. By contrast, Late Cenozoic palaeogeographic reorganization caused by uplift <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tibetan Plateau and <b>retreat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Paratethys <b>Sea</b> contributed less to <b>the</b> evolutionary evolution <b>of</b> EAWM. Spectral analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EM 2 data first provided direct evidence of orbitally influenced deposition in the study area and thus the EAWM variations during the Neogene period. The 100 -kyr period became weak since ~ 10 Ma, possibly due to the decrease in sensitivity of a more stable, continental-scale ice sheet in Antarctica to local insolation forcing, deserving further investigation...|$|R
50|$|Marine {{terraces}} often {{result from}} marine erosion along rocky coast lines in temperate regions due to wave attack and sediment {{carried in the}} waves. Erosion also takes place in connection with weathering and cavitation. The speed of erosion is highly dependent on the shoreline material (hardness of rock), the bathymetry, and the bedrock properties and can be between only a few millimeters per year for granitic rocks and more than 10 m per year for volcanic ejecta. The <b>retreat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> cliff generates a shore (wave-cut/abrasion-) platform {{through the process of}} abrasion. A relative change of the sea level leads to regressions or transgressions and eventually forms another terrace (marine-cut terrace) at a different altitude while notches in the cliff face indicate short stillstands.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that sea-level rise during the last interglacial implies retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS). The prevalent hypothesis is that the retreat coincided with the peak Antarctic temperature and stable water isotope values from 128, 000 years ago (128 [*]ka); very early in the last interglacial. Here, by analysing climate model simulations of last interglacial WAIS loss featuring water isotopes, we show instead that the isotopic response to WAIS loss is in opposition to the isotopic evidence at 128 [*]ka. Instead, a reduction in winter sea ice area of 65 ± 7 % fully explains the 128 [*]ka ice core evidence.

Salinity data revealed that the ice releases brine both during freezing and melting conditions, before the solid ice starts melting. Four different methods were tested to quantify heat and salt fluxes. The covariance method underestimated the fluxes with up to two orders of magnitude, and hence did not resolve the fluxes present in the tank. The turbulent kinetic energy budget suggests non-uniform turbulence in the tank, leading to large differences in sources and sinks <b>of</b> turbulence over <b>the</b> relatively small surface area.
