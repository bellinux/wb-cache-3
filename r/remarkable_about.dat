25|$|A {{small town}} in northwestern Pennsylvania, Cambridge Springs seems like an {{unlikely}} location to hold an international chess tournament. However, {{back in the early}} 1900s Cambridge Springs was a flourishing resort town due to a couple geographic oddities. The primary factor was location. At first glance nothing seems <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> the town, but in fact it is located on the Erie Railroad line, halfway between New York and Chicago, which made it an ideal stopover location for railway patrons. The secondary factor was the local mineral springs which were visited by numerous people seeking to improve their health.|$|E
25|$|Lewis Campbell was {{the first}} to make {{exhaustive}} use of stylometry to prove objectively that the Critias, Timaeus, Laws, Philebus, Sophist, and Statesman were all clustered together as a group, while the Parmenides, Phaedrus, Republic, and Theaetetus belong to a separate group, which must be earlier (given Aristotle's statement in his Politics that the Laws was written after the Republic; cf. Diogenes Laertius Lives 3.37). What is <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> Campbell's conclusions is that, {{in spite of all the}} stylometric studies that have been conducted since his time, perhaps the only chronological fact about Plato's works that can now be said to be proven by stylometry is the fact that Critias, Timaeus, Laws, Philebus, Sophist, and Statesman are the latest of Plato's dialogues, the others earlier.|$|E

500|$|New York Times critic Frank Rich {{said of the}} 1992 London production: [...] "What is <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> Mr. Hytner's direction, {{aside from}} its unorthodox faith in the virtues of {{simplicity}} and stillness, {{is its ability to}} make a 1992 audience believe in Hammerstein's vision of redemption, which has it that a dead sinner can return to Earth to do godly good." [...] The Hytner production in New York was hailed by many critics as a grittier Carousel, which they deemed more appropriate for the 1990s. [...] Clive Barnes of the New York Post called it a [...] "defining Carousel—hard-nosed, imaginative, and exciting." ...|$|E
500|$|Cruttwell's {{relations}} with his colleagues and {{students have been}} the subject of contradictory reports. [...] Waugh's biographer, Selena Hastings, describes him as of [...] "unprepossessing" [...] appearance, [...] "good-hearted but difficult", inclined to misogyny, brusque and sometimes offensive towards his male colleagues. Waugh's description is of someone [...] "tall, almost loutish, with the face of a petulant baby", of indistinct speech, who [...] "smoked a pipe which was attached to his blubber-lips by a thread of slime". Stannard records that Waugh's student contemporary Christopher Hollis, found nothing particularly <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> Cruttwell. [...] "Like Waugh", says Stannard, [...] "Cruttwell played up his eccentricities and had an uncharitable sense of humour". Ellis's 2004 biographical sketch suggests that much of Cruttwell's rebarbative manner, may have been the result of simple shyness.|$|E

500|$|Carissa Pavlica from TV Fanatic noted, [...] "'Concentrate and Ask Again'" [...] {{did little}} to drive the {{overriding}} story forward, but it did a brilliant job of making me question everything." [...] Nonetheless, she commented that it [...] "... was nowhere near as intense as 'Reciprocity'." [...] IGN writer Ramsey Isler did not think there was anything [...] "particularly <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> the core elements of this story – it's the same old formula that both Fringe and The X-Files used frequently – but the episode has a generous helping of little revealing character elements sprinkled throughout." [...] Isler praised the final ten minutes for [...] "provid some really interesting action" [...] with Olivia's ending of the case, and the revelation of Simon's note in conjunction with Sam's knowledge of the First People. He ultimately graded the episode 7.5/10.|$|E
500|$|It was {{nominated}} for the 2003 Prix Louis-Delluc. Senses of Cinema suggested that it is Rivette's most important work since his 1974 film Celine and Julie Go Boating and saw it as [...] "a film about filmmaking", including it in their favourite films of 2004. DVD Verdict concluded that [...] "it is not only intelligent, but willing to assume the same of its audience". Glenn Kenny rated it as his favourite film of the decade, and film curator Miriam Bale writing in Slant Magazine included it in her ten most enduring films of the decade. Film Comment was equally taken with the film, stating that [...] "what's most <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> the film is how moving it is finally, how much is at stake after all—nothing Rivette has done before prepares you for the emotional undertow that exerts itself in The Story of Marie and Juliens final scenes." [...] LA Weekly described the film as [...] "elegant and unsettling"; The Age called it [...] "quietly mysterious and haunting" [...] and [...] "heartrending".|$|E
500|$|Contrasting Everything ThatHappens WillHappen Today with MyLifeintheBushofGhosts, {{some have}} found a {{connection}} between the two. Reviewers have found similarities in Eno's solo album AnotherGreenWorld and the Eno-produced Talking Heads albums FearofMusic and RemaininLight, as well as LittleCreatures, which was produced by the band. This is partly due to the unique use of technology in the creation of all of the albums associated with Eno. Other commentators have emphasized {{the differences between the two}} projects. For instance, The Age Bernard Zuel considers these expectations built by the earlier work to be [...] "unfair... and inaccurate." [...] TheObserver review by KittyEmpire labels this album [...] "conservative" [...] and JohnDoran of TheQuietus calls it [...] "lessexciting"—Erie Times-News reviewer Dr.Rock goes as far as to call it an [...] "antithesis" [...] to BushofGhosts. In particular, the experimental nature of the former has been contrasted with the popmusic style of this album and the lack of Africanbeats and worldmusic. AudraSchroeder of TheAustinChronicle noted [...] "Thirtyyears after first collaborating on the TalkingHeads, these two don't have to mine the past since there's nothing that <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> Everything." [...] FrancisJones summed up his review for HotPress by concluding [...] "No boundaries were harmed in its making but ETHWHT is an album of unquestionably great songs" [...] and LouiseGray of NewInternationalist declared that, [...] "it's not got the edgy, funky bricolage that characterized the earlier album and nor does it seek that." [...] At the same time, other reviewers have found the break with the experimental nature of MyLifeintheBushofGhosts to be positive. JimDeRogatis from the ChicagoSun-Times observed: ...|$|E

500|$|... "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] was favourably {{received}} by critics. Steve Morse of The Boston Globe called the song [...] "powerful" [...] {{and described the}} backing vocals as tender and choirlike. Don McLeese of the Chicago Sun-Times {{described it as a}} [...] "hymn to human rights". Adrian Thrills of NME called it [...] "a simple, plaintive lament of stunning beauty and sadness". Nicholas Jennings of Maclean's felt that it was The Joshua Trees [...] "most topical song". Music journalist Andrew Mueller felt the track was a [...] "wilfully downbeat finale". In Rolling Stone, Steve Pond said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' is built around desolate images of loss, but the setting is soothing and restorative—music of great sadness but also of unutterable compassion, acceptance and calm." [...] Lennox Samuels of The Dallas Morning News stated that there was [...] "an ineffable sadness in Bono's vocals and images where 'Night hangs like a prisoner / Stretched over black and blue'", calling it [...] "a moving tribute" [...] to people around the world who had lost loved ones to warfare and conflict. He added [...] "hat's <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> the song is that despite the intrinsic pain, it remains eerily cleansing. Even in the midst of decay and excess and horror, Bono can find hope and absolution." [...] In 2006 Bono described it as [...] "a beautiful end to the album", saying, [...] "That song means as much to me as any of the songs on that album, it's right up there for me," [...] and noting that it is a song [...] "I'm very proud of to this day." ...|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} widespread acclaim. Kate Stables {{wrote in}} Sight & Sound: [...] "Elegant restraint is the film’s watchword ... In this enjoyably deliberate film, each shot and scene is carefully composed {{to pay homage}} to 50s cinema, yet infused with an emotional ambiguity which feels decidedly contemporary." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said: [...] " [...] has made a serious melodrama about the geometry of desire, a dreamy example of heightened reality that fully engages emotions despite the exact calculations with which it's been made... 'Carol's' lush but controlled visual look is completely intoxicating. This is filmmaking done by masters, an experience to savor." [...] A.O. Scott wrote in The New York Times: [...] "At once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, 'Carol' is a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros. With sparse dialogue and restrained drama, the film is a symphony of angles and glances, of colors and shadows." [...] Amy Taubin from Film Comment said: [...] "The narrative, precisely chiseled by Phyllis Nagy from the ungainly novel, is deceptively simple ... What's <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> Carol is that it seems to exist entirely in the present moment—to be precise, in that electric, elastic, heart-stopping/heart-racing present of romantic desire. It is a film composed of gestures and glances, its delicacy a veiled promise of abandon. And it could not exist without the extraordinary performances of Blanchett and Mara." [...] David Stratton of The Australian wrote: [...] "The meeting of these two women is an electrifying scene; their eyes make contact, and nothing of significance is said, apart from the usual interaction between shopper and shop assistant, but Haynes and his wonderful actors make it very clear that something momentous has occurred — love at first sight." ...|$|E

2500|$|Film Threat critic Scott Knopf {{gave the}} film a maximum five-star rating {{and called the}} script [...] "fantastic". He also lauded the film's {{innovative}} nature; [...] "Of course they meet. Of course they fall for each other. Of course there are problems. It sounds cliché but what's <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> 500 Days is how the film explores new ways to tell the world's oldest story". He concluded that the film was [...] "the best romantic comedy since Love Actually." ...|$|E
2500|$|James Wood, {{writing in}} The New Yorker, called it [...] "one {{of the most}} {{remarkable}} postcolonial books I have ever read". He wrote that it has been [...] "consistently misread as a 9/11 novel, which stints what is most <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> it: that it is a postcolonial re-writing of The Great Gatsby." [...] In an interview with the author published {{at the end of the}} Harper Perennial paperback edition, Joseph O'Neill remarks, [...] "Clearly Netherland is having some sort of conversation with The Great Gatsby—saying goodbye to it perhaps, and to some of the notions associated with that wonderful book." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Wiseman (2011) {{has noted}} that OBE {{research}} has focused on finding a psychological explanation and [...] "out-of-body experiences are not paranormal and do not provide evidence for the soul.

[...] A study conducted by Jason Braithwaite and colleagues (2011) linked the OBE to [...] "neural instabilities in the brain's temporal lobes and to errors in the body's sense of itself". Braithwaite et al. (2013) reported that the [...] "current and dominant view is that the OBE occurs due to a temporary disruption in multi-sensory integration processes." ...|$|E

2500|$|What is <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> {{this period}} in White's {{life is the}} fact that his limited {{finances}} allowed him to create only about 8 photographs each month, yet the quality of those images was so consistently high that he quickly received widespread acclaim for his work. [...] He also worked under very difficult conditions. Due to the long hours at his bookkeeping job, he convinced family and friends to model for him in the evening or very early in the morning, even though they sometimes had to awake as early as 4 am in the summer in order to pose for him before he went to work.|$|E
2500|$|Like {{the earlier}} Liang Dynasty stone-stele maps (mentioned above), there were large and {{intricately}} carved stone stele {{maps of the}} Song period. For example, the [...] squared stone stele map of an anonymous artist in 1137, following the grid scale of 100 li squared for each grid square. What is truly <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> this map is the incredibly precise detail of coastal outlines and river systems in China (refer to Needham's Volume 3, Plate LXXXI for an image). The map shows 500 settlements and a dozen rivers in China, and extends as far as Korea and India. On the reverse, {{a copy of a}} more ancient map uses grid coordinates in a scale of 1:1,500,000 and shows the coastline of China with great accuracy.|$|E
2500|$|Noriko’s father, Shukichi, {{works as}} a college {{professor}} and is the sole breadwinner of the Somiya family. It {{has been suggested that}} the character represents a transition from the traditional image of the Japanese father to a very different one. Sato points out that the national prewar ideal of the father was that of the stern patriarch, who ruled his family lovingly, but with an iron hand. Ozu himself, however, in several prewar films, such as I Was Born, But… and Passing Fancy, had undercut, according to Sato, this image of the archetypal strong father by depicting parents who were downtrodden [...] "salarymen" [...] (sarariman, to use the Japanese term), or poor working-class laborers, who sometimes lost the respect of their rebellious children. Bordwell has noted that [...] "what is <b>remarkable</b> <b>about</b> Ozu's work of the 1920s and 1930s is how seldom the patriarchal norm is reestablished at the close [...]" ...|$|E
