50|$|The {{connecting}} rods of smaller steam locomotives are usually of rectangular cross-section but, on small locomotives, marine-type rods {{of circular cross-section}} have occasionally been used. Stephen Lewin, who built both locomotive and marine engines, was a frequent user of <b>round</b> <b>rods.</b> Gresley's A4 Pacifics, such as Mallard, had an alloy steel connecting rod {{in the form of}} an I-beam with a web that was only 0.375 in thick.|$|E
50|$|These puddle {{balls are}} then {{transported to the}} hammer or {{squeezer}} by dragging them along iron slopes built between the furnace and the shingling equipment or, more commonly, the puddle balls are loaded into iron wheelbarrows and transported to their destination. Shingling expels slag and welds shut internal cracks, while breaking off chunks of impurities. The iron is then re-heated and rolled out into flat bars or <b>round</b> <b>rods.</b> For this, grooved rollers were used, the grooves being of successively decreasing size so that the bar was progressively reduced to the desired dimensions. Some of the iron oxide is from the scales that form in the later steps of shingling and rolling. The quality of this may be improved by faggoting.|$|E

The terminals were often slightly flared plain round cylinders which were folded back to hook round each other to fasten the torc at the throat. Other Celtic torcs may use various ways of forming the hoop: plain or patterned round bars, two or more bars twisted together, thin <b>round</b> <b>rods</b> (or thick wire) wound round a core, or woven gold wire.

40|$|Linear quadrupoles {{with added}} hexapole fields are described. The shifts in ion {{oscillation}} frequency {{caused by the}} addition of a hexapole field are calculated within the effective potential model. Methods to construct linear quadrupoles with added hexapole fields with exact electrode geometries and with <b>round</b> <b>rods</b> are discussed. A quadrupole with added hexapole field can be constructed with <b>round</b> <b>rods</b> by rotating two rods (say the y rods) towards an x rod. Computer simulations are used to investigate the possibility of mass analysis with quadrupoles with added hexapole fields. We find that a quadrupole with an added hexapole field in the range 2 – 12 % can provide mass analysis provided the dc is applied with the correct polarity and value. When a rod set is constructed with <b>round</b> <b>rods,</b> other multipoles in the potential degrade the peak shape, resolution and transmission. The largest of these after the quadrupole and hexapole are a dipole and octopole term. With round rod sets, the peak shape can be improved by using different diameters for the x and y rod pairs to minimize the octopole term in the potential and by injecting ions at the field center where the dipole term is zero. Calculations of the boundaries of the stability diagram for this case show the boundaries move out, relative to those of a pure quadrupole field, but remain sharp...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of measurements of liquid metal fluidity and linear shrinkage of nickel alloy IN- 713 C in vacuum induction melting furnace Balzers VSG- 2. Because of limited volume of the furnace chamber special models for technological trials were designed and constructed to fit in the mould of dimensions 170 x 95 x 100 mm. Two different designs of test models were proposed: horizontal <b>round</b> <b>rods</b> and modified spiral. Preliminary studies were carried out for alloys Al-Si. Horizontal <b>round</b> <b>rods</b> test was useful for evaluation of fluidity of hypoeutectic silumin, however in case of nickel superalloy the mould cavity was completely filled in each test because of high required pouring temperature.

40|$|The true {{shape of}} a double-helical {{geometry}} in a rope cross-section is needed {{for the design of}} ropes to predict the interstitial voids that need to be filled with water-blocking material. Commercially-available software such as AutoCAD, Inventor, Ideas, Mechanical Desktop, etc. are unable to develop this geometry. Thus, the objective {{of this study is to}} develop the parametric equations needed to produce scaled rope cross-section plots. Two fundamental mathematical tools are used to describe the cross-section of helical wire rods. The premier tool is the equation of the "Pencil of Spheres" where coordinates of the second helix centerline in a global coordinate system is found. To establish the centerline, coordinates of the helical path geometric transformations are developed. The equation of the "Pencil of Spheres" for the second helix is then intersected with a plane perpendicular to the rope axis. This results in the true shape of the helical <b>round</b> <b>rods.</b> The objective of this research is to derive a mathematical model that describes the exact geometry of double-helical <b>round</b> <b>rods</b> in a plane perpendicular to the rope axis.

The oxygen chemically combines with the iron in the ferrous material to oxidize the iron quickly into molten iron oxide, producing the cut.

40|$|Modulation of the {{voltages}} {{applied to}} a quadrupole mass filter (QMF), either RF or RF and DC, leads to splitting of the stability region into islands of stability. The ion optical properties, such as transmission, resolving power and peak tails of the first upper stability islands have been investigated by numerical simulation of ion trajectories. The dependence of the location of this island on the amplitude of the modulation and the parameter ν = ω/Ω = Q/P where ω is modulation frequency, Ω is main angular radio frequency, and Q and P are integers, is calculated in detail. Different methods of adjusting the QMF resolution are examined. It is found that operation at {{the upper and lower}} tips of the stability islands created by amplitude modulation of the RF voltage is preferred, because of the technical simplicity of this method and a reduction of the required separation time. Amplitude modulation improves the performance of a QMF constructed with <b>round</b> <b>rods,</b> in comparison to perfect quadrupole fields. For example, with amplitude modulation of the RF, to reach a resolution of R 0. 1 = 1200 requires only about 75 RF cycles of ion motion in a quadrupole field created by <b>round</b> <b>rods...</b>|$|E

Three types of contact between the composite rods and a potted epoxy compound are considered: adhesion, adhesion-friction, and friction ones. The corresponding three-dimensional problems in the elastic statement are solved by the finite-element method (FEM) with account of nonlinear Coulomb friction. An analysis of stresses {{on the surface of}} the composite rod revealed the locations of high concentrations of operating stresses.

40|$|An {{improved}} single-cell photonic band-gap (PBG) {{structure with}} an inner row of elliptical rods (PBG-E) was tested with high power at a 60  Hz repetition rate at X-band (11. 424  GHz), achieving a gradient of 128 [*][*]MV/m at a breakdown probability of 3. 6 × 10 ^{- 3 } per pulse per meter at a pulse length of 150  ns. The tested standing-wave structure {{was a single}} high-gradient cell with an inner row of elliptical rods and an outer row of round rods; the elliptical rods reduce the peak surface magnetic field by 20 % and reduce the temperature rise of the rods during the pulse by several tens of degrees, while maintaining good damping and suppression of high order modes. When compared with a single-cell standing-wave undamped disk-loaded waveguide structure with the same iris geometry under test at the same conditions, the PBG-E structure yielded the same breakdown rate within measurement error. The PBG-E structure showed a greatly reduced breakdown rate compared with earlier tests of a PBG structure with <b>round</b> <b>rods,</b> presumably due to the reduced magnetic fields at the elliptical rods vs the fields at the <b>round</b> <b>rods,</b> as well as use of an improved testing methodology. A post-testing autopsy of the PBG-E structure showed some damage on the surfaces exposed to the highest surface magnetic and electric fields. Despite these changes in surface appearance, no {{significant change in the}} breakdown rate was observed in testing. These results demonstrate that PBG structures, when designed with reduced surface magnetic fields and operated to avoid extremely high pulsed heating, can operate at breakdown probabilities comparable to undamped disk-loaded waveguide structures and are thus viable for high-gradient accelerator applications...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{itself to}} the solution {{of a number of}} problems which arise in the development of Radio Frequency filters, particularly those involving coupled transmission lines as resonant elements. The text is divided into a number of sections dealing with individual topics. After a brief description of Darlington filter design principles, there is an account of the pivotal role of quarter wave sections and their vital part in the realisation of high frequency filters. This is followed by the development of new material relating to equivalent circuits of physical lines in terms of quarter wave sections, and its application to improvements in the design of wide-band filters. There follows an account of a new procedure for calculating the dimensions of comb-line and inter-digital filters. This section includes a new proposal for the inversion of Getsinger's procedure to permit the calculation of rectangular rod dimensions and spacings from given electrical data. There is also an algorithm for use with <b>round</b> <b>rods</b> which circumvents the tedious manual interpolation procedure devised by Cristal. There follows an investigation of and a proposed solution to a long-known but unexplained discrepancy existing between the calculated and measured pass-band width of the class of comb-line filters. With the new procedure the discrepancy reported previously to be of the order of 10 % is eliminated. Finally, experimental evidence is adduced to verify the algorithms outlined in the preceding chapters...|$|E
40|$|In-trap {{fragmentation}} of ions in a hybrid linear ion trap triple {{quadrupole mass spectrometer}} occurs at pressures about 5 e- 5 torr. At these low pressures, efficient {{fragmentation of}} heavy ions (such as the singly charged homogenously substituted triazatriphosphorine of mass 2721. 89 Da) can {{take a long time}} because of the relatively low collision frequency with the background gas and the high internal energy content required to produce fragmentation. Increasing the amplitude used for dipolar excitation leads to loss of the ion upon the quadrupole rods. In the work presented here, the addition of a dc octopolar field to a linear ion trap is described. The dc octopolar field was created by the addition of four auxiliary electrodes situated between the quadrupole rods at a distance of 10 mm from the axis. The inclusion of the dc octopolar field was shown to cause the ions’ frequency of motion to shift out of phase with the excitation signal at high radial amplitudes. This resulted in beat-like trajectories with periods of excitation and de-excitation as the ions’ frequency of motion shifted in and out of phase with the excitation signal. This led to a reduction in the loss of ions on the quadrupole rods during the excitation process. The result is an increased fragmentation efficiency relative to the fragmentation efficiency obtained when using an LIT constructed of <b>round</b> <b>rods</b> only. The inclusion of the dc octopolar field allowed the ion to be fragmented more efficiently in a relatively short excitation period...|$|E
