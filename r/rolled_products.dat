Alcoa operates two bauxite mines in Western Australia—the Huntly and Willowdale mines. [...] Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals owns and operates three alumina refineries in Western Australia: [...] Kwinana, Pinjarra, and Wagerup. The Wagerup expansion plans have been put on hold due to the Global Financial Crisis. [...] Two aluminum smelters are also operated in the state of Victoria at Portland and Point Henry; the Point Henry smelter was scheduled to be closed in August 2014. Alcoa Australia <b>Rolled</b> <b>Products,</b> a 100% Alcoa Inc. venture, operates two rolling mills. The Point Henry Rolling mill in Victoria and the Yennora rolling mill in N.S.W. have a combined rolling capacity of approx. 200,000 tonnes. Alcoa uses 12,600 GWh or 15% of Victoria's electricity annually.|$|E

40|$|The {{high quality}} {{requirements}} of sheet metal (eg steel, aluminium) {{and the modern}} trends towards computer control of sheet rolling have placed an increasing emphasis on {{a thorough understanding of}} the physics of the flat rolling process. The examination of the thermal behaviour of the <b>rolls</b> and <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> as the latter is deformed in a rolling stand, is integral to an understanding of rolling. The thermal process occurring in the rolling stands affects the mechanical and metallurgical properties of the material, governs the roll cooling requirements, and influences the overall flatness of the <b>rolled</b> <b>product.</b> This thesis is primarily concerned with the prediction of the short-time variation of the temperature field of the <b>rolls</b> and <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> as the latter is deformed in a rolling stand. The effect of an oxide layer, which often exists in hot rolling of steel, on the thermal process has been studied in detail. It is demonstrated that, under normal rolling conditions, the thermal process occurring in rolling can be reduced by perturbation methods to one of heat transfer between three slabs with plane parallel boundary contact. As a result, the reduction in heat loss to the rolls and the increase in temperature of the <b>rolled</b> <b>product</b> due to the insulating effect of the oxide layer can be quantified. The contribution of each heat source term, namely, that arising from the effect of the bulk temperature difference between the <b>roll</b> and <b>rolled</b> <b>product,</b> frictional heating at the roll/rolled product contact region, and deformation heating in the <b>rolled</b> <b>product</b> within the <b>roll</b> gap, to the overall thermal process is estimated for both hot and cold rolling conditions...|$|R

The <b>rolled</b> <b>product</b> comprises a central sheet of A 1100 aluminum alloy sandwiched between upper and lower sheets of either A 3003 or A 6063 aluminum alloy. The simulations examine the effects of sheet thickness and reduction ratio on the maximum effective stress, maximum effective strain, Y-direction load, and maximum damage induced within the <b>rolled</b> <b>product.</b> This study also compares the simulation results for the final thicknesses of the three layers in the rolled A 1100 / A 3003 (A 6063) sandwich sheet with experimental measurements and bonding conditions...|$|R

40|$|The {{residual}} stresses in a <b>roll</b> formed <b>product</b> {{play a critical}} role in determining the product quality. They are generally very complex and frequently difficult to predict due to the complicated fabricating process and its parameters. Consequently, they attract many concerns from roll forming scholars and engineers. However, how to inspect the {{residual stresses}} in <b>roll</b> formed <b>products</b> efficiently and economically is still a challenge. This paper introduces a novel, highly efficient, operationally simple and accurate residual stresses measurement method for evaluating the residual stresses in <b>roll</b> formed <b>products.</b> It utilizes a modification of the current sectioning methods to firstly obtain the membrane and bending residual stresses components. Then a novel material removal approach, the tapered removal, is employed to determine the layering stresses component by measuring the curvature variations of the remaining sample through its thickness direction. A practical implementation of the method is performed through the residual stresses measurement of a typical roll formed square hollow section (SHS). The method is successfully verified by the neutron diffraction method. The new method is expected to become a routine measuring method to determine the residual stresses distribution in <b>roll</b> formed <b>products,</b> with potentially significant impact on the roll forming industry...|$|R
