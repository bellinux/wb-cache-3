60|$|She {{began by}} {{thinking}} what an exceedingly gentlemanly man her brother was; in his ordinary working clothes {{he had been}} as much at his ease with those ladies {{as though he had}} been dressed in a city costume, which, however, would not have been nearly so becoming to him as his loose flannel shirt and broad straw hat. She then began to regret that her mind worked so slowly. If it had been quicker to act, she would have asked that young lady to come some day and go up in the haymow with her. It would be a positive charity to give a girl with longings, such as she saw that one had, a chance of knowing what real country life was. It would be pleasant to show things to a girl who <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about them. From this she began to think of Dora Bannister. Dora was a nice girl, but Miriam could not think of her as one to whom she could show or tell very much; Dora liked to do the showing and telling herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I got him some, but in {{five minutes}} the poor old Dutchman was dead. There was no one on deck. All were {{shouting}} and singing in the captain's cabin, so I went and turned in forward. Morning was just breaking when I suddenly woke. There was a great light, and running on deck I saw the fire pouring out from the cabin aft. I suppose they had all drunk themselves stupid and had upset a light, and the fire had spread and suffocated them all. Anyhow, there were none {{of them to be}} seen. I got hold of a water keg and placed it in a boat which luckily hung out on its davits, as Jans had, the day before, been calking a seam in her side just above the water's edge. I made a shift to lower it, threw off the falls, and getting out the oars, rowed off. I lay by for some little time, but did not see a soul on deck. Then, as I had nowhere particular to go, I lay down and slept. On getting up I found that I had drifted two or three miles from the ship, which was now a mere smoking shell, the greater part being burnt to the Water's edge. Two miles to the north lay the land, and getting out an oar at the stern I sculled her to shore. I suppose I had been seen, or that the flames of the ship had called down the people, for there they were in the bay, and such a lot of creatures I never set eyes on. Men and women alike was pretty nigh naked, and dirt is no name for them. Though I was but a boy I was taller than most. They came round me and jabbered and jabbered till I was nigh deafened. Over and over again they pointed to the ship. I thought they wanted to know whether I belonged to it, but it couldn't have been that, because when I nodded a lot of 'em jumped into some canoes which was lying ashore, and taking me with them paddled off to the ship. I suppose they <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if they could have what they could find. That wasn't much, but it seemed a treasure to them. There was a lot of burned beams floating about alongside, and all of these which had iron or copper bolts or fastenings they took in tow and rowed ashore. We hadn't been gone many hundred yards from the vessel when she sunk. Well, young gentlemen, for upwards of two years I lived with them critturs. My clothes soon wore out, and I got to be as naked and dirty as the rest of 'em. They were good hands at fishing, and could spear a fish by the light of a torch wonderful. In other respects they didn't seem to have much sense. They lived, when I first went there, in holes scratched in the side of a hill, but I taught 'em to make huts, making a sort of ax out of the iron saved. In summer they used to live in these, but in winter, when it was awful cold, we lived in the holes, which were a sight warmer than the huts. Law, what a time that was! I had no end of adventures with wild beasts. The way the lions used to roar and the elephants--" ...|$|E

Govan states that he was torn between {{continuing}} his studies or focusing on becoming a musician; he ultimately decided to concentrate on the latter.

Govan declined, despite inititiating contact in the first place.

5000|$|After its March 2008 {{premiere in}} the United States, Stephen Holden called the film an [...] "amusing ball of fluff {{that refuses to}} judge its characters’ amoral high jinks"; he calls it a [...] "shrewdly cast" [...] film [...] "winking at the vanity of wealthy voluptuaries and hustlers playing games of tainted love." [...] According to Holden, the film is [...] "too {{frivolous}} even to be called satire." [...] According to Mick LaSalle, what makes the film [...] "fun" [...] is [...] "the harshness wrapped in a pretty package. The movie stars Audrey Tautou and Gad Elmaleh, who are about the only French stars that it's almost impossible to imagine having an active sex life. Their aura of innocence helps. Still, in America, no director could ever make this movie, even with the most innocent-seeming actors on the planet. This is way European, folks, not meant for our eyes, and, of course, that's the whole kick." [...] LaSalle notes the following:"Priceless is an entertaining sex farce that takes its characters to some of best hotels and most exclusive restaurants in France, and to watch it is to marvel at how some people live - and how you don't. But here's the interesting thing: Through this seduction, Priceless turns the viewer into a harlot, too, who can suddenly understand why Irene would do anything and sleep with anybody just {{to stay in this}} lifestyle. Likewise, we understand - instinctively, without thinking about it or judging it - why Jean might start sleeping with an older rich woman, just so he can stay in the hotels where Irene stays. Would {{you want to be the}} person who orders the drinks or fetches the drinks? How easy would it be to go back to normal life after confirming what you never <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> that the rich really do have it better, as in a lot better, as in money really does buy happiness? So Priceless is silly, but it's not so silly. It's pretty to look at, often very funny, but it corrupts its audience as it corrupts its characters."In a one-star review (...) upon the film's June 2008 release in the United Kingdom, Peter Bradshaw call the film a [...] "gruesomely unfunny and tacky comedy-farce" [...] and notes [...] "the whole movie slavers over bling, and has a nasty, dated air of pseudo-worldliness and ersatz sophistication. With its luxury-tourist locations, it is basically vulgar, and not in a good way, and reminded me of the opening title sequence to the 70s TV show The Persuaders!, but without that programme's charm." ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{has been}} much {{discussion}} over who wrote [...] "La balsa" [...] and, [...] "for those who {{the answer is that}} it was coauthored between Nebbia and Tanguito, the question lies in who was the fundamental mind of such a creation." [...] Santiago Montiveros of MDZ Online described it as [...] "the most widespread and controversial debate that the history of rock nacional has given." [...] The controversy began after the 1973 post-mortem release of Tanguito's only studio album, Tango, which compiled songs he recorded for Mandioca Records between 1969 and 1971, including a version of [...] "La balsa". In the track, before starting to perform, Tanguito can be heard jokingly stating [...] "Let's play a commercial song", followed by Javier Martínez urging him to play [...] "La balsa", alleging that [...] "it is yours". The phrase [...] "In the bathroom of La Perla de Once you composed 'La balsa'", said by Martínez in a [...] "sinister and sententious" [...] way, is looped until Tanguito starts playing. Clarín felt that the song's lyrics [...] "are heard differently when it is known that the one who sings them ended up under a train, gripped by hard drugs and the effects of electroshock." [...] Mariano del Mazo of Página/12 wrote: [...] "Thus was born—with that record and that phrase, more than with his death—the first martyr of Argentine rock: a modest martyr, corresponding to a ghetto, a marginal music." [...] The repeated statement spoken by Martínez established the iconic status of La Perla, and installed the myth that Nebbia stole the song from Tanguito, taking advantage of his [...] "madness and ingenuity". As a result, Nebbia earned the hatred of many suburban rock fans during the 1970s. After the disbandment of Los Gatos in 1970, Nebbia refused to perform the song live because {{he did not want to}} [...] "develop his career based on hits, clichés or labels." [...] This decision became stronger after the authorship controversy, and he did not perform the song until 2001. Martínez denied the myth in 2007, on the occasion of the single's 40th anniversary, stating:Journalism and show business work with controversy, and that is why that phrase I said in Tango's album was misunderstood. In the bathroom of La Perla de Once you composed [...] "La balsa". I did not mean that he was the only author, that is a myth. The truth of the matter is that both of them wrote it, Nebbia and Tango, and I was an eyewitness at a table in La Perla. Tango showed the first part to Litto, and the next day he brought the rest. This is how [...] "La balsa" [...] was born.The polemic was revived in 1993, after the release of Tango Feroz, a biopic by Marcelo Piñeyro that focused on Tanguito. The film suggested that Tanguito had written the entirety of the song, and that Nebbia only embellished it. In a particular scene, Tanguito's character is shown listening to the song on the radio and, heavily shocked by the changes, breaks everything around him. The box office success of the film attracted the attention of the media, which focused extensively on Tanguito's myth. In his 2004 book Una mirada: reflexiones & anécdotas de vida, Nebbia criticised the historical inaccuracy and [...] "ruthlessness" [...] of the flim, writing: [...] "They never <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> how things were like, nor did they want to accept what kind of character Tanguito was. Simply because this was against the image they needed to make the film a commercial success. The old trick of the movies about rock singers who died in a tragic and strange way." [...] In an article for Página/12 regarding the 2013 musical theatre adaptation of Tango Feroz, Pipo Lernoud was highly critical of the film, writing that [...] "it is a pity that once again the legend of the Christ-like and solitary saint hides the collective creative work and turns a wonderful experience into a product for the capitalist market". Both Nebbia and Lernoud felt that the film's plot was the filmmakers' revenge for not having allowed them to use their songs in the soundtrack. Lernoud further wrote: ...|$|E

The data suggests that the students <b>really</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what end users would expect from the system to be built. This might also be reflected by the high percentage of posts referring to the design-level and the high number of moderators’ posts asking for clarification.
