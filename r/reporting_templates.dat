Included in the guidance are standard measurements protocols and analysis procedures which greatly impact the measurement systems that countries need to establish. The actual reporting of REDD+ results is not going through the National Communications, however, but through the Biennial Update Reports (BURs).|$|E
5000|$|The {{sharing of}} patient {{information}} between health care organizations and IT systems is changing from a [...] "point to point" [...] model to a [...] "many to many" [...] one. The European Commission is supporting moves to facilitate cross-border interoperability of e-health systems and to remove potential legal hurdles, {{as in the}} project www.epsos.eu/. To allow for global shared workflow, studies will be locked when they are being read and then unlocked and updated once reading is complete. Radiologists {{will be able to}} serve multiple health care facilities and read and report across large geographical areas, thus balancing workloads. The biggest challenges will relate to interoperability and legal clarity. In some countries it is almost forbidden to practice teleradiology. The variety of languages spoken is a problem and multilingual <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> for all anatomical regions are not yet available. However, the market for e-health and teleradiology is evolving more rapidly than any laws or regulations.|$|E
30|$|The IHE MRRT {{integration}} profile specifies {{the roles}} of the different actors involved in creation of imaging <b>report</b> <b>templates,</b> namely <b>Report</b> <b>Template</b> Creator, <b>Report</b> <b>Template</b> Manager and <b>Report</b> Creator, bearing {{the roles of}} creating the templates, of managing them and using them to create actual imaging reports, respectively. Communications between these actors rely on the HTTP protocol. As for DICOM structured reports, they can be exchanged with both traditional DICOM messaging (Storage and Query/Retrieve) and the DICOMweb set of RESTful services over HTTP, more adapted to the access to images and reports from web browsers.|$|R
30|$|Major {{radiological}} societies already offer {{collections of}} such MRRT-compliant <b>report</b> <b>templates.</b> For example, the RSNA Reporting Initiative {{offers more than}} 250 <b>report</b> <b>templates</b> on its radreport.org website. There {{has also been a}} memorandum of understanding signed between the European Society of Radiology and the RSNA, leading a joint Template Library Advisory Board and an open platform where European users can upload and discuss their <b>report</b> <b>templates</b> (open.radreport.org) [23]. Other societies have also published various consensus statements providing disease-specific <b>report</b> <b>templates</b> which have been shown to provide the most benefit to referring physicians in most cases [24]. For example, the American Society of Abdominal Radiology published a consensus statement regarding reports for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and the Korean Society of Abdominal Radiology published a similar paper with regards to rectal cancer MRI [25, 26].|$|R
30|$|Nevertheless, {{integration}} of structured radiology reporting is still scarce in clinical routine. Some vendors (e.g., Nuance, Burlington, MA, USA) provide {{the possibility of}} integrating such <b>report</b> <b>templates</b> into their speech-recognition solution. However, even in these cases reports are composed using <b>report</b> <b>templates</b> but then stored as plain text in the hospital or radiology information system. Although this surely allows for more easy text mining due to more standardised reports, storing the respective parts of information from the <b>report</b> <b>templates</b> in a dedicated database as discrete bits of information would allow for even easier access to these data.|$|R

40|$|The Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) {{has been}} {{promoting}} structured radiology reports by creating "best practices " <b>reporting</b> <b>templates.</b> The RSNA Reporting Template Library {{has been developed}} {{with the goal of}} integrating reusable knowledge into the clinical reporting process, which has intentionally incorporated standardized biomedical terminologies to reduce communication errors caused by term ambiguity and inconsistency in radiology reporting. To date, only a few studies have evaluated the usage and coverage of biomedical terminologies in radiology reporting. This research addresses the gap with the objectives to assess how well standardized biomedical terminologies represent radiological knowledge as reflected by the RSNA <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> and to obtain first-hand information to guide the enhancement of both standard terminologies and RSNA <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> from users ’ perspective. We employed the RadMap and NCBO BioPortal Annotator to identify matching terms from RadLex ® and SNOMED CT ® with the terms in the templates. The RadMap mapping results show that a majority of terms in the sample <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> were mapped at least partially to terms in the RadLex®. The <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> analyzed with the BioPortal Annotator yielded 38 % to 53 % coverage of the standardized terminologies. The findings provide useful estimates of how well the standardized terminologies capture the concepts that appear in <b>reporting</b> <b>templates.</b> The researchers believe that standardized terminologies {{play an important role in}} radiology structured reporting and the incorporation of standardized terminologies into <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> will greatly improve the quality of radiology report...|$|E

30|$|In {{the last}} 10  years, RSNA has {{undertaken}} {{several initiatives to}} support and facilitate SR [13]. A well-known example {{is the development of}} structured <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> to be integrated into radiology information systems [14]. Today, these <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> are still mostly used as macro’s in text-based reporting systems, but the much more versatile Extensive Markup Language (XML) version of the templates is ready for integration into dedicated, more powerful software, especially after extension of the DICOM standard [15].|$|E
30|$|At this moment, {{more than}} 200 {{templates}} are already online {{and the number}} of views has passed the 1 million mark. Hong and Kahn [19] have measured how much of the conventional narrative reports is covered by the concepts included in the RSNA <b>reporting</b> <b>templates.</b> The <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> accounted for 17 – 49  % of the concepts that actually appeared in a sample of corresponding radiology reports. These findings suggest the templates provide useful coverage of the “domain of discourse” in radiology reports.|$|E
40|$|A frame/object {{hierarchy}} of document templates and documents A document template is a frame with a slot for {{each part of}} the document (a part can be a single line or part of a line). Many slots have a procedure attached; the procedure obtains the information from a database, if it is available, or displays a menu of possible values, or asks the user a question. The document templates are arranged in a hierarchy, so that the slots in common to all documents of a class, such as meeting announcements, need to be specified only once; these slots than inherit down to all descendants of the class.

30|$|The Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) {{initiative}} defined an integration profile {{dedicated to}} the provision of <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> called Management of Radiology Report Templates (MRRT). In MRRT <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> are provided in HTML 5, a syntax that enables direct management by web browsers. The data structure is flexible. It allows both management and free text and coded entries, e.g. using RadLex. Basic metadata use terms from the Dublin Core metadata element set, a standard terminology for document metadata [20]. This choice strikes a balance between expression of coded content and description of a user interface and the related data capture methods [21, 22].|$|E
30|$|As for the {{necessary}} adoption of common <b>reporting</b> <b>templates,</b> the current RSNA {{and the joint}} ESR-RSNA efforts are a first step. A next step should try to rationalise the organisation of SR templates through a logical organisation based on the ontology-based classification of clinical situations and imaging procedures. The adoption of multilingual templates should be systematically preferred to avoid the quantitative explosion {{of the number of}} templates. These technical aspects are complex and should be addressed in collaboration with organisations developing standard terminologies/ontologies. In particular, <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> should increasingly include quantitative measurements (imaging biomarkers), especially when formalised clinical decision models exist, which are based on these measurements.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Outcome after {{cardiac arrest}} and {{cardiopulmonary}} resuscitation {{is dependent on}} critical interventions, particularly early defibrillation, effective chest compressions, and advanced life support. Utstein-style definitions and <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> have been used extensively in published studies of cardiac arrest, {{which has led to}} greater understanding of the elements of resuscitation practice and progress toward international consensus on science and resuscitation guidelines. Despite the development of Utstein templates to standardize research reports of cardiac arrest, international registries have yet to be developed. In April 2002, a task force of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation (ILCOR) met in Melbourne, Australia, to review worldwide experience with the Utstein definitions and <b>reporting</b> <b>templates.</b> The task force revised the core reporting template and definitions by consensus.

RadLex terminology provides a single unified source of terms providing information in radiology reports [3]. For a given examination and clinical context, structured reports should list the same major elements in the same order, regardless of author [3].|$|R

30|$|At {{the same}} time, {{it is useful}} to look at {{initiatives}} which are complementary to those of the RSNA and ESR. One example is the modular approach developed by Fatehi and Safdar [21], which introduces a form of artificial intelligence in the reporting process by interrelating blocks of structured report with the clinical problems presented by the referring clinician. The Society for Interventional Radiology (SIR) has launched a pilot program to capture the information recorded using structured <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> into a data registry for aggregate analysis [22]. Similar initiatives worldwide deserve our attention, active interest and involvement.|$|E
30|$|Following {{the growing}} {{evidence}} that structured reports {{would have a}} beneficial impact on the communication between radiologists and referring physicians, the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) presented its Reporting Initiative aimed at developing and providing vendor-neutral <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> [19, 20]. This was later picked up by Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise (IHE) {{and led to the}} publication of the Management of Radiology Report Templates (MRRT) profile [21]. This profile extensively describes the concepts and technical details for interoperable, standardised, structured, report templates. Report templates are developed and provided using a subset of standard Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and allow for the integration of RadLex terms. This offers the possibility of further standardising report template content as synonyms and even content in different languages could be mapped to the same RadLex code [22].|$|E
30|$|SR offers radiologists {{opportunities}} {{to improve their}} service to other stakeholders, such as referring clinicians, administrators, health insurance providers, and healthcare authorities. For many radiologists, the traditional way of FT reporting has high emotional value. If radiologists can be convinced {{of the advantages of}} SR, it is likely that they will become early adopters, rather than face the potential risk of having it forced upon them. We identified a demand for the healthcare industry to develop technology allowing radiology departments to produce reports in formats required by their clients without compromising accuracy, completeness, workflows, and cost-benefit balance. RadLex and the RSNA <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> may become the backbone of such a system. Complementarily to this, systems that allow radiologists to continue dictating FT reports and automatically transform these into structured reports seem to meet the expectations of radiologists as well as other stakeholders.|$|E

30|$|The DICOM {{standard}} {{has introduced}} {{rules for the}} encoding, transmission and storage of the imaging diagnostic report [8]. The scope of DICOM structured reporting is the standardisation of structured data and clinical observations in the imaging environment [13]. DICOM structured reporting contains text with links to other data such as images, waveforms, and spatial or temporal coordinates. Its structure, along with its wide use of coded information, enables the semantic understanding of the data that {{is essential for the}} Electronic Healthcare Record deployment [8]. While DICOM structured reporting provides a data structure allowing to embed structured reports in a standard “container” that can be read across different software applications, it does not define how the content should be structured or standardised. DICOM structured <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> have been defined to constrain the possible structures and to provide basic codes {{that can be used to}} encode specific reports, such as breast imaging or vascular ultrasound procedures reports.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Structured {{reporting}} uses consistent {{ordering of}} results and standardized terminology {{to improve the}} quality and reduce the complexity of radiology reports. We sought to define a generalized approach for radiology reporting that produces flexible outline-style reports, accommodates struc-tured information and named reporting elements, allows reporting terms to be linked to controlled vocabularies, uses existing informatics standards, and allows structured report data to be extracted readily. We applied the Regular Language for XML–Next Generation (RELAXNG) schema language to create templates for 110 <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> created as part of the Radiological Society of North America reporting initia-tive. We evaluated how well this approach addressed the project’s goals. The RELAX NG schema language expressed the cardinality and hierarchical relationships of reporting con-cepts, and allowed reporting elements to be mapped to terms in controlled medical vocabularies, such as RadLex®, Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms®, and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes®. The approach provided extensibility and accommodated the addition of new features. Overall, the approach has proven to be useful and will form the basis for a supplement to th...|$|E
30|$|Structured {{reporting}} {{is emerging as}} {{a key element of}} optimising radiology’s contribution to patient outcomes and ensuring the value of radiologists’ work. It is being developed and supported by many national and international radiology societies, based on the recognised need to use uniform language and structure to accurately describe radiology findings. Standardisation of report structures ensures that all relevant areas are addressed. Standardisation of terminology prevents ambiguity in reports and facilitates comparability of reports. The use of key data elements and quantified parameters in structured reports (“radiomics”) permits automatic functions (e.g. TNM staging), potential integration with other clinical parameters (e.g. laboratory results), data sharing (e.g. registries, biobanks) and data mining for research, teaching and other purposes. This article outlines the requirements for a successful structured reporting strategy (definition of content and structure, standard terminologies, tools and protocols). A potential implementation strategy is outlined. Moving from conventional prose reports to structured {{reporting is}} endorsed as a positive development, and must be an international effort, with international design and adoption of structured <b>reporting</b> <b>templates</b> that can be translated and adapted in local environments as needed.
