2500|$|As {{the full}} company name (Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau) makes clear, all Rohrbach {{aircraft}} were all-metal, including their duralumin skinning. The Robbe was a monoplane {{with a high}} wing described {{at the time as}} a semi-cantilever structure, meaning that there were no rigid wing struts but that it retained external bracing with flying wires to the wings from the lower fuselage. The wings were mounted with 5° of dihedral. In plan they were straight tapered, with unswept leading edges and blunt tips. Internally the wings were built around single box spars, assisted by leading edge and trailing edge boxes. The edge boxes also served as fuel tanks. At this time there were still doubts about the <b>repairability</b> of metal aircraft, so the Robbe's two-part wing was designed to be easy to inspect internally by the removal of the edge boxes and all parts were replaceable. [...] The wing skin was riveted to the ribs.|$|E

50|$|The {{modular design}} of the AW system allows for flexibility, {{serviceability}} and <b>repairability</b> under field and combat conditions. Major components, such as the barrel and the bolt, can be switched between rifles, or replaced in the field by their operator {{with the help of}} some tools.

50|$|Sniper rifles {{manufactured}} {{for military}} service are often designed for very high durability, range, reliability, sturdiness, serviceability and <b>repairability</b> under adverse environmental and combat conditions, at the sacrifice of a small degree of accuracy. Military snipers and sharpshooters may also be required to carry their rifles and other equipment for long distances, making it important to minimize weight. Military organizations often operate under strict budget constraints, which influences the type and quality of sniper rifles they purchase.|$|E
50|$|Reaching {{the goal}} of zero waste {{requires}} the products of manufacturers and industrial designers to be easily disassembled for recycling and incorporated back into nature or the industrial system; durability and <b>repairability</b> also reduce unnecessary churn in the product lifecycle. Minimizes packaging also solves many problems early in the supply chain. If not mandated by government, choices by retailers and consumers in favor of zero-waste-friendly products can influence production. To prevent material from becoming waste, consumers, businesses, and non-profits must be educated in how to reduce waste and recycle successfully.|$|E

50|$|The impact between steel hammer {{heads and}} the objects being hit can create sparks, which may ignite {{flammable}} or explosive gases. These are a hazard in some {{industries such as}} underground coal mining (due {{to the presence of}} methane gas), or in other hazardous environments such as petroleum refineries and chemical plants. In these environments, a variety of non-sparking metal tools are used, primarily made of aluminium or beryllium copper. In recent years, the handles have been made of durable plastic or rubber, though wood is still widely used because of its shock-absorbing qualities and <b>repairability.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Produced for {{model year}} 1983, the Kawasaki KZ750 L3 {{was very similar}} to the 1982 Gpz750. This is the year during which the Gpzs made the jump towards [...] "sportbikes", while the KZ line {{branched}} off as [...] "sport cruisers". This model can be distinguished by the three horizontal stripes along the gas tank and tailpiece, orange, red and yellow, and the lack of fairing typical on GPZ bikes of the same era. The Kawasaki inline-four engines are considered very robust and reliable. Therefore, this motorcycle, and others with similar engines, are sought after for their rideability and <b>repairability.</b>|$|E
50|$|If {{there was}} a way to create {{reversible}} covalent bonds, this would combine high processability, <b>repairability,</b> and performance. There have been already many strategies tried that would allow such plastics. Vitrimers combine the desirable properties of both classes: they show the mechanical and thermal properties of thermosets and can be also molded under the influence of heat. Vitrimers can be welded like (silicon) glasses or metals. Welding by simple heating allows the creation of complex objects. Vitrimere like (silicon) glasses or metals are welded. A weld by simply heating allows customizing complex objects. Vitrimers could thus be a new and promising class of materials with many uses.|$|E

50|$|Up to the 1980s, {{radiator}} cores {{were often}} made of copper (for fins) and brass (for tubes, headers, and side-plates, while tanks {{could also be}} made of brass or of plastic, often a polyamide). Starting in the 1970s, use of aluminium increased, eventually taking over {{the vast majority of}} vehicular radiator applications. The main inducements for aluminium are reduced weight and cost. However, the superior cooling properties of Copper-Brass over Aluminium makes it preferential for high performance vehicles or stationary applications. In particular MW-class installations, copper-brass constructions are still dominant (See: Copper in heat exchangers). CuproBraze is a copper-alloy heat exchanger technology for harsh temperature and pressure environments such as those in the latest generations of cleaner diesel engines mandated by environmental regulations. Its performance advantages over radiators made with other materials include better thermal performance, heat transfer, size, strength, durability, emissions, corrosion resistance, <b>repairability,</b> and antimicrobial benefits.|$|E
50|$|Over time, these factions have {{acquired}} their own particular style of play. For example, the <b>repairability</b> of the Bannson's Raiders units allows the player to conduct quick strikes {{followed by a}} retreat. Three factions (House Liao, Clan Jade Falcon, and Clan Sea Fox) have inherent abilities not stated on their figures to compensate for higher point costs. Examples of these abilities include improved damage to elite or novice-ranked units, better targeting through forests, improved jumping attacks, or gaining the ability to deprive an enemy player of an order. This concept has been extended in later expansions {{by the addition of}} faction pride cards and special pilot abilities. Starting with the release of the Domination expansion set in January 2006, the faction abilities for House Liao, Clan Jade Falcon, and Clan Sea Fox were replaced with faction pride cards. However, the three factions' figures released before that set can still use the team abilities without having to require a faction pride card.|$|E
5000|$|There were {{a number}} of other San Francisco waste {{reduction}} policies passed during this time and most of them focus on city government operations. For example, the Mayor's Executive Order on Bottled Water bans the purchase of bottled water with city funds while the Precautionary Purchasing Ordinance, [...] "requires city departments to purchase products that maximize post-consumer recycled content and recyclable or compostable materials, and that favor durability, <b>repairability,</b> and reuse." [...] All of the aforementioned policies have had large impacts on diversion rates {{and by the end of}} 2007, the City had reached 72 percent. However, it was clear that increased participation in the residential curbside collection program was desirable if San Francisco were to reach zero waste by 2020. According to Jack Macy, Commercial Zero Waste Coordinator for the City of San Francisco, if everyone in San Francisco participated in the program by separating all the materials accepted, a 90 percent diversion rate would be achievable. San Francisco realized that voluntary participation would not suffice, and in 2009, the Board of Supervisors passed the Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance, requiring all persons in San Francisco to separate their recyclables, compostables and landfilled trash and to participate in recycling and composting programs.|$|E
50|$|The basic hoist has two {{important}} characteristics to define it: Lifting medium and power type. The lifting medium is either wire rope, {{wrapped around a}} drum, or load-chain, raised by a pulley with a special profile to engage the chain. The power can be provided by different means. Common means are hydraulics, electrical and air driven motors. Both the wire rope hoist and chain hoist have been in common use since the 1800s, however mass production of an electric hoist did not start until the early 1900s and was first adapted by Germany. A hoist can be built as one integral-package unit, designed for cost-effective purchasing and moderate use, {{or it can be}} built as a built-up custom unit, designed for durability and performance. The built-up hoist will be much more expensive, but will also be easier to repair and more durable. Package units were once regarded as being designed for light to moderate usage, but since the 60s this has changed. Built-up units are designed for heavy to severe service, but over the years that market has decreased in size since the advent of the more durable packaged hoist. A machine shop or fabricating shop will use an integral-package hoist, while a Steel Mill or NASA would use a built-up unit to meet durability, performance, and <b>repairability</b> requirements. NASA has also seen a change in the use of package hoists. The NASA Astronaut training pool, for example, utilizes cranes with packaged hoists.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} an approach for reasoning about the <b>repairability</b> of workflows at design time. We propose a heuristic-based {{analysis of a}} workflow that aims at evaluating its definition, considering different design aspects and characteristics that affect its <b>repairability</b> (called <b>repairability</b> factors), {{in order to determine}} if the workflow schema supports repairable executions of its activities through the application of repair actions. The analysis intents to identify and evaluate the impact of critical design flaws affecting the <b>repairability</b> of workflows. The results of this analysis are fed back to the workflow designer and used to improve the <b>repairability</b> of the workflow by making appropriate changes to its definition...|$|E

40|$|Real-life {{complex systems}} are often {{required}} {{to have a high}} level of autonomy, even in faulty situations. The diagnosability analysis is the a priori study of the capability of a system to be self-aware about its current state by analysing the observations received by the sensors. The <b>repairability</b> analysis is the a priori study of the capability of a system to react to faults by applying repair actions. Even though they are strongly related, these properties are generally analysed independently. This paper builds upon {{the state of the art}} in both domains and proposes a joint property, called self-healability, which achieves a bridge between diagnosability and <b>repairability.</b> We first revisit and extend the classical definitions of diagnosability and <b>repairability.</b> Then, we give our definition of self-healability illustrated with several examples. ...|$|E
