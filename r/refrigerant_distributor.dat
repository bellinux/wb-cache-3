40|$|Evaporators {{found in}} most HVAC 2 ̆ 6 R {{applications}} use multiple circuits to address the multidimensional optimization problem of cost, capacity, and air-/refrigerant side pressure drop. However, an inherent problem of having multiple refrigerant circuits in evaporators is that maldistribution can occur. This maldistribution can be caused on the refrigerant side by quality and/or mass flow maldistribution at the <b>refrigerant</b> <b>distributor.</b> On the air-side, maldistribution {{can be caused by}} uneven airflow and/or air inlet temperature; on both sides the possibility of uneven fouling exists. To reduce the performance penalties caused by air-side maldistribution, the hybrid control method was used to optimize the refrigerant distribution to individual circuits. The hybrid control uses a primary expansion valve, which provides for most of the pressure drop, and smaller secondary balancing valves, which adjust the individual circuit mass flowrates. This approach was chosen since it is expected that the balancing valves can be manufactured at much lower cost than individual expansion valves for each circuit. In order to assess how severe the influence on maldistribution is, four applications with high potential for air-side maldistribution were selected and investigated experimentally, as well as in simulation studies. ^ Application 1 was a 3 -ton R 404 A walk-in cooler refrigeration system for a storage room with a target temperature of 2 °C (35. 6 °F). It was found that the increasing air-side maldistribution, caused by uneven frost built up over time can lead to severe hunting with liquid overfeed from the evaporator, when using the factory installed thermostatic expansion valve (TXV). An electronic expansion valve (EXV) was used as baseline for the performance evaluations. It was found, that in both the TXV and EXV case, significant refrigerant maldistribution occurred even if the system was tested with no enforced air-side maldistribution. After including the balancing valves, the system coefficient of performance (COP) increased by approximately 4...|$|E
50|$|Internally {{equalized}} valves {{can be used}} on {{single circuit}} evaporator coils having low pressure drop. Externally equalized valves must be used on multi-circuited evaporators with <b>refrigerant</b> <b>distributors.</b> Externally equalized TXVs {{can be used on}} all applications; however, an externally equalized TXV cannot be replaced with an internally equalized TXV.|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} {{a new type of}} a heat pump outdoor unit using an aluminum flat tube heat exchanger in order to improve the energy saving capability of an air conditioner. There are several difficulties in keeping a desired drainage performance, frost formation performance, as well as even distribution of refrigerant, when applying the flat tube heat exchanger to heat pump outdoor units. In order to achieve the same drainage performance and the frost formation performance as those of conventional heat exchangers, we have adopted new plate fins with ellipse cutouts. Flat tubes were inserted in the ellipse cutouts, and the slit position on a plate fin was properly adjusted. In order to achieve the even distribution of <b>refrigerant,</b> an aluminum <b>distributor</b> and 3 -way pipes were installed to the evaporator. In this report, first we describe features of the flat tube heat exchanger. Next, we present and explain experimental results of the air-side heat transfer coefficient and the air-side pressure drop on the condition of dry, wet, and frost state respectively. Moreover, we present experimental results of the total heat transfer performance, including the refrigerant performance, under the conditions of the condensation and the evaporation. Finally, we explain the heat transfer performance and the effect of the flat tube heat exchanger to a conventional one in the case that the developed heat exchanger was mounted in heat pump outdoor unit...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of compact brazed plate heat exchangers (CBE) operating as evaporator in heat pump applications. The thesis, and the performances investigated, has been divided into three main sections; One zone evaporator performance; Two zone evaporator performance; and finally Local performance. The 'One zone evaporator performance' section considers the evaporator as one "black box". It was found that "approaching terminal temperatures" were obtained as low overall heat flux is employed. It was {{also found that the}} total area averaged film heat transfer coefficient was affected by changes of the brine mass flow rate. This indicates that the widespread Wilson plot method may not be used to determine flow boiling heat transfer coefficients. Further, it seems that co- and counter-current flow configuration performs equally well if the superheat is kept low. A numerical simulation of the above investigations indicates that a nucleate boiling model better predicts the performance compared to a convective evaporation model. Finally, the significant impact of the <b>refrigerant</b> inlet <b>distributor</b> design was illustrated using several CBEs with different inlet geometries but with identical heat transfer surfaces. The 'Two zone evaporator performance section' considers the evaporator as two "black boxes", i. e. the boiling and superheating boxes. Thermochromic liquid crystals (TLC) was used to determine the boiling heat transfer area. The resulting flow boiling heat transfer coefficient was found to correlate with heat flux. The superheated heat transfer area was then estimated using single phase correlations. It was observed that the TLC measurements and the predicted superheating area did not agree. Possible causes for this deviation were discussed. The most likely explanation found was the presence of mist flow at the higher vapor quality range in the boiling section of the evaporator. The 'Local Performance' section considers local pressure drop and flow boiling heat transfer. The Chisholm parameter was found not to be a constant and was found to correlate well with the kinetic energy per volume. The resulting predictions of the pressure drop were better than ± 10 %. The resulting local flow boiling heat transfer coefficient, at different vapor quality, mass flux and heat flux, was compared to flow boiling correlations available in the literature. It was found that the saturated nucleate pool boiling correlation by Cooper (1984) and narrow channel flow boiling correlations (Tran 1999, Lazarek and Black 1982) predicted the experimental data better than several traditional flow boiling correlations, developed for larger tubes.
