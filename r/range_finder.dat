5|$|Some Tornado {{variants}} carry different avionics and equipment, {{depending on}} their mission. The Tornado ECR is devoted to Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) missions, operated by Germany and Italy. The Tornado ECR is equipped with an emitter-locator system (ELS) to spot radar use. German ECRs have a Honeywell infrared imaging system for reconnaissance flights. RAF and RSAF Tornados have the Laser <b>Range</b> <b>Finder</b> and Marked Target Seekers (LRMTS) for targeting laser-guided munitions. In 1991, the RAF introduced TIALD, allowing Tornado GR1s to laser-designate their own targets.|$|E
5|$|Many {{items from}} the battlecruiser were sent to New Zealand after she was scrapped. Equipment {{including}} several 4-inch guns, a <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> and laundry equipment, were used by military units while other artifacts were placed on display in museums. During World War II, the 4-inch guns were the main armament of the land batteries which protected the entrances to the harbours at Auckland, Wellington and Lyttelton. The captain's piupiu was returned to New Zealand in 2005, and is {{on display at the}} Torpedo Bay Navy Museum in Auckland alongside the ship's bell and other artifacts.

5|$|The HL234, {{an engine}} born from the {{developments}} initiated {{by attempting to}} convert the Maybach HL230 to fuel injection, would have increased the power to about 800 to 900 PS (hp). The Entwicklungskommission Panzer unanimously decided that HL234 be immediately included in the engine design and procurement program. The AK-7-200 was also explored {{as an alternative to}} the Maybach Olvar-B drive train, but Waffenamt research and development department Wa Prüf 6 found that it offered inferior driving characteristics and so the Maybach Olvar-B was retained. There are also a program using the Simmering- Graz-Pauker Sla.16 engine, but the war's constraint on supplies and capitulation resulted in the cancellation of this program. Krupp proposed mounting a new main weapon, the 10.5cm KwK L/68. Wa Prüf 6 was not supportive of this as the Heer had not accepted the cannon itself. Other suggested improvements included stabilised sights, a stabilised main gun, an automatic ammunition feed, a Zeiss stereoscopic <b>range</b> <b>finder,</b> heated crew compartment, stowage for an additional 12 rounds, and an overpressure & air filtration system to protect against poison gas. However, these also never got beyond the proposal stage or did not enter production before the war ended.|$|E

25|$|The Air Force and Army {{will also}} use their Advanced Light {{helicopters}} (ALH) (HAL Dhruv) and the HAL Light Combat Helicopter (LHC) as Nag carriers.

The thermal imager is likely to be imported, but the gimballed turret, stabilisation, laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> and associated electronics have been designed in India and will be manufactured locally. The Nag ATGM is regarded as a highly capable missile, even though its development has been protracted, mainly due to the technological challenges of developing a state of the art IIR sensor equipped top attack missile.

25|$|The Leclerc tank {{features}} the HL-60 gunner's primary sight from SAGEM. The sight's day channel offers X3.3 and X10 magnification (x14 {{in case of}} the UAE version). The night channel thermal intensifier offers X3, X6, X10 and X20 magnifications. No emergency or auxiliary sights are mounted. The laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> is of the Nd:YAG type. The tank commander can observe the surroundings through 7 periscopes and the HL-70 Panoramic sight. The HL-70 {{is equipped with a}} day channel at X2.5 and X10 magnification and a night channel with X2.5 magnification. On the Series XXI and UAE variant the HL-120 and HL-80 commander's panoramic sight are mounted respectively. The sight offers X2.5 and X10 magnification (and an electronic zoom X2) for the thermal intensifier and a laser <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> of the Nd:YAG type.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} self-calibration of robotic hand-mounted laser <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> by means of active motion of the robot. Through range-measuring of a plane of unknown {{position}} and orientation, the mounting parameters of the <b>range</b> <b>finders</b> and the coordinates of the world plane are estimated. Systematic measurement errors can also be calibrated at the same time. The approach is fully autonomous, in that no initial guesses of the unknown parameters are to be provided from the outside by humans for the solution {{of a set of}} nonlinear equations. In fact, the initial values are all found in closed forms by the algorithm itself. Sufficient conditions for a unique solution are derived in terms of controlled motion sequences. Experimental results in both a simulated and a real environments are reported.

25|$|A new sight called Dynarange is {{currently}} being procured {{as part of the}} German Infantryman of the Future project.

It would increases the weapon's effective range to 600 m (2,000ft) against moving and stationary targets.

25|$|The Cobra Missile System is a {{functional}} {{development of the}} XM26 and the TOW missile system developed for the failed AH-56 helicopter. Originally designed for the AH-1Q and AH-1S Cobras, the AH-1F Modernized Cobra was also rebuilt to use the system. The original iteration of the system comprises launchers allowing for four BGM-71 TOW missiles per aircraft pylon to be carried, and a TSU or Telescopic Sight Unit, to allow for targeting and guidance of the missile. The TSU has been upgraded with the LAAT (Laser-Augmented Airborne TOW), a day/night <b>range</b> <b>finder,</b> and C-NITE (Cobra-Night Imaging Thermal Equipment), a thermal imagine/FLIR system specifically for the AH-1S and AH-1F Cobra helicopters.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Army {{had been}} very {{impressed}} {{with the performance of}} the 25cm experimental sets and became interested in using it as a <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> in a Gun Laying radar. Operators would point the radar at targets indicated to them by search radars, and from then on the radar information would be fed to the analogue computers that aimed the guns. Power was not a serious concern in this case as the range would be relatively short. The Air Defence Experimental Establishment (ADEE) of the Army was working on this using the klystron design from Birmingham and British Thomson-Houston (BTH) as their industrial partner.|$|E
25|$|Slough Fort was {{initially}} armed with seven 7-inch rifled breech loaders (RBLs) positioned in the casemates. It was manned by three officers, one NCO and 75 other ranks. Between October 1889 and December 1891, {{a pair of}} wing batteries were constructed from concrete {{on either side of}} the fort, with a <b>range</b> <b>finder</b> position being added to the fort's roof. The new batteries accommodated two 9.2-inch and two 6-inch breech loaders on disappearing mountings, allowing them to recess below ground level once they had fired. These were much more powerful and longer ranged weapons than the old RBLs and were capable of engaging a battleship at a substantial distance. The old RBLs were removed.|$|E

25|$|BMP-3F – Specially {{designed}} for operations at sea, with improved seaworthiness and buoyancy, capability to move afloat at sea state 3 and fire with the required accuracy at sea state 2. Compared {{to the basic}} model, the vehicle design features changes increasing floatability and vehicle stability: the self-entrenching equipment is omitted, a lightweight anti-surge vane and an air intake tube are introduced; the BMP-3F turret is also protected by anti-surge vanes. Water jet propellers develop a speed of 10km/h when afloat. The BMP-3F design allows the vehicle to come ashore under rough sea conditions and to tow the same-type vehicle.
