40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the precise and meaningful measurement of change {{as it pertains to}} the urban subarea <b>residential</b> housing <b>status.</b> The word 2 ̆ 2 measurement 2 ̆ 2 is qualified as meaningful {{in the sense that the}} approach adopted is of relevance to public policy. Specifically, the dissertation is aimed at providing answers to the following research questions: First, how can the changes in <b>residential</b> housing <b>status</b> in the different parts of an urban area be precisely and meaningfully measured? Second, what variables are most appropriate for the measurement? Third, can these variables be useful for differentiating between various parts of the urban area? Fourth, do the resul ts of an urban subarea housing classification system depend on the specific variables used in the classification? Using data drawn mainly from the 1960 and 1970 censuses of housing for Portland, Oregon SMSA, a simple but robust methodology is developed for indexing and monitoring changes in the urban subarea <b>residential</b> housing <b>status.</b> The research borrows appreciably from Fisher and Winnick 2 ̆ 7 s, and Toulan 2 ̆ 7 s formulations of the filtering process in the urban housing market. The variables used in the measurement and classification analyses include the changes in the following variables: median home value or contract rent, median household income relative to the average household size, housing quality, percentage of all occupied housing units, and percentage of owner occupied housing units. Principal component analysis is used for construction of composite index of change in urban subarea <b>residential</b> housing <b>status.</b> Furthermore, this composite index is used in a multivariate linear discriminant analysis for the classification of the various subareas (census tracts) in Portland, Oregon SMSA. The findings validate the variables employed in the analyses, and support the hypothesis that the results of an urban subarea classification system depend, to some extent, on the housing market variables used in the classification. The findings from the study show that operationally simple but robust systems can be developed for monitoring the changes in <b>residential</b> housing <b>status</b> in urban neighborhoods, in relation to the general urban area...|$|R

Previous studies {{have pointed out that}} detection of local accumulation of tuberculosis patients based on their residential addresses may be lim-ited by a lack of matching between residences and tuberculosis infection sites. This study aimed to identify possible tuberculosis hotspots using TB genotype clustering statuses and a concept of “activity space”, a place where patients spend most of their waking hours. We further compared the spatial distribution by different <b>residential</b> <b>statuses</b> and describe urban environmental features of the detected hotspots. Methods Culture-positive tuberculosis patients notified to Shinjuku city from 2003 to 2011 were enrolled in this case-based cross-sectional study, and their demographic and clinical infor-mation, TB genotype clustering statuses, and activity space were collected.

25|$|Secure {{land tenure}} is {{important}} for slum dwellers as an authentic recognition of their <b>residential</b> <b>status</b> in urban areas. It also encourages them to upgrade their housing facilities, which will give them protection against natural and unnatural hazards. Undocumented ownership with no legal title to the land also prevents slum settlers from applying for mortgage, which might worsen their financial situations. In addition, without registration of the land ownership, the government has difficulty in upgrading basic facilities and improving the living environment. Insecure tenure of the slum, as well as lack of socially and politically acceptable alternatives to slums, also creates difficulty in citywide infrastructure development such as rapid mass transit, electrical line and sewer pipe layout, highways and roads.|$|E
25|$|Circular {{migration}} {{also plays}} an important role in international development, and policy initiatives have the potential to aid in this development. Many policy makers from both national and international institutions are advocating for policies that make the movement of migrant workers between their home and host countries easier. Ideally, established circular migration systems facilitated and protected by the law would allow for the “triple-win” scenario that benefits countries of origin, countries of destination and the migrants themselves. The International Organization for Migration advocates that destination countries should provide mechanisms that promote repeat and regular circular migration, while also providing incentives to return to their same job. There are several possible measures that would increase the ease and impact of circular migration. The provision of legal <b>residential</b> <b>status</b> and flexible work visas would likely allow for increased circular migration between countries. Giving returning migrants priority for residency permits for additional temporary employment over first-time migrants would make it easier for circular migrants to obtain official legal status, which has shown to be beneficial for migration. In addition, long-term multi-entry visas provided to return migrants would encourage multiple and repeated trips. Furthermore, one of the most simple policy recommendations is that governments should promote the free movement of individuals within the borders of their own countries. Lastly, in an effort to combat brain drain, the World Bank has called for developed countries to pay a tax to developing countries in order to make up for the loss of human capital.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{attempts}} to broadly interpret the American suburban experience, which he views as unique. He states that [...] "the United States {{has thus far}} been unique in four important respects that {{can be summed up}} in the following sentence: affluent and middle-class Americans live in suburban areas that are far from their work places, in homes that they own, and in the center of yards that by urban standards elsewhere are enormous. This uniqueness thus involves population density, home-ownership, <b>residential</b> <b>status,</b> and journey-to-work." [...] His working definition of suburbs has four components: function (non-farm residential), class (middle and upper status), separation (a daily journey-to-work), and density (low relative to older sections). Also dominant in the book is the notion that the wealthy began the flight from the city first — something that the middle classes eventually emulated as city tax rates gradually increased to pay for resulting urban problems - as the poorer classes remained in the older central urban areas.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to reconcile the}} empirical evidence with the argument in favour of a positive effect of homeownership on exit rates from unemployment, known as 's thesis". While the theory would suggest that homeowners experience more difficulties than renters to exit unemployment due to lower residential mobility, the empirical literature has typically found lower unemployed duration for homeowners. Taking into account {{some of the reasons}} for the falsification of the Oswald's thesis, we provide evidence which supports it. At first, in a theoretical model of endogenous job search we show that homeowners' higher moving costs imply unambiguously lower search and lower job finding rates, even though an opposite effect works for jobs which do not require a move. Then, in the empirical analysis we make use of data drawn from the British Household Panel Survey to compare job search intensity measures by housing tenure. We find that, controlling for housing costs and for different <b>residential</b> <b>statuses,</b> non-employed outright owners have definitely a lower attachment to the labour market than renters, and that this effect is even more evident when we compare them to private renters...|$|R

Genderisation and ethnification {{of a low}} <b>status</b> <b>residential</b> area in {{the local}} press Media often {{contributes}} to segregation by constructing low <b>status</b> <b>residential</b> areas as “different” from what is “normal” and “Swedish”. Research into media representations of these residential areas often focuses big city contexts. Furthermore, research tends to be preoccupied {{with the construction of}} ethnic differences, paying little attention to the relationship between construction processes of gender and ethnicity. This article is a critical analysis of how the local daily newspapers in a medium sized town, Kalmar, construct stereotypes of immigrants and gendered identities in the low <b>status</b> <b>residential</b> area Norrliden. Two newspapers were studied in search for articles related to the area, published during the year 2005. Despite the newspapers’ claim that they want to contribute to a more nuanced and less stereotyped image of the residential area the consequences of their work seem to be the opposite. The representation sof the area are coded with stereotypes suggesting that the area is unsafe and dangerous and that {{the people who live there}} are motivated by affect and emotions rather than by successful socialisation. These representations are also characterised by notions of ethnicity and gender, as well as class. Norrliden is described as an area in need of change and improvement, as an unfinished project dependent upon aid from the outside. A reading of the 2005 media representations of Norrliden exposes an example of “symbolic violence” in that texts and photographs repeatedly degrade the area and its inhabitants.

Spatial statistics (Global Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi* statistics) identified significant hotspots in 152 census tracts, and urban environmental features and tuberculosis patients' characteristics in these hotspots were assessed. Of the enrolled 643 culture-positive tuberculosis patients, 416 (64. 2 %) were general inhabitants, 42 (6. 5 %) were foreign-born people, and 184 were homeless people (28. 6 %). The percentage of overall genotype clustering was 43. 7 %. Genotype-clustered general inhabitants and homeless people formed significant hotspots around a major railway station, whereas the non-clustered general inhabitants formed no hotspots. This suggested the detected hotspots of activity spaces may reflect ongoing tuberculosis transmission sites and were characterized by smaller residential floor size and a higher proportion of non-working households. Activity space-based spatial analysis suggested possible TB transmission sites around the major railway station and it can assist in further comprehension of TB transmission dynamics in an urban setting in Japan...|$|R
