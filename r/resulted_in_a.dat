25|$|There {{are only}} a few nontrivial {{structures}} that are (interdefinable as) reducts of a total order. Forgetting the orientation <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> betweenness relation.

50|$|Two {{cautions}} <b>result</b> <b>in</b> one warning. Two warnings <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> point deduction, {{and three}} point deductions in one round can <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> disqualification.|$|R
5|$|The post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 34-yard line, and the Hokies began another drive. Two rushing plays <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> first down for the Hokies at their 49-yard line. The Hokies were unable to enter Florida State's half of the field, however, as two incomplete passes and a running play <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loss of yardage. Florida State's offense returned to the game at their 30-yard line following the kick with 4:17 remaining in the first half.|$|E

50|$|A {{leadership}} election may <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new leader, or may {{confirm the}} status quo. If {{the party in}} question is in government, {{the election of a}} new leader will <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new Prime Minister, Premier or Chief Minister; if the party is the opposition, the election of a new leader will <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new Opposition Leader.|$|R
50|$|An {{increase}} in the temperature of <b>a</b> semiconducting material <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increase <b>in</b> charge-carrier concentration. This <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> higher number of charge carriers available for recombination, increasing the conductivity of the semiconductor. The increasing conductivity causes the resistivity of the semiconductor material to decrease with the rise <b>in</b> temperature, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> negative temperature coefficient of resistance.|$|R
5|$|A {{few months}} after the initial North American release in June 1991 for the NES, Battletoads got a Japanese-localized release for the Famicom, getting {{distributed}} in Japan by NCS, opposed to Tradewest. This release featured several gameplay tweaks, which <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> marginally easier experience.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Gettysburg, Pickett {{commanded}} the Department of Southern Virginia and North Carolina. In February, Pickett {{was ordered to}} capture New Bern, North Carolina from Federal forces. The subsequent Battle of New Bern <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Confederate defeat. Following the battle, Pickett ordered the execution of 22 Confederate deserters found to have joined the United States Army.|$|E

25|$|This <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loss of {{function}} of the cycle, and <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> accumulation of glutamate. This glutamate further stimulates the NMDA receptors, thus acting synergistically with quinolinic acid to increase its neurotoxic effect by increasing the levels of glutamate, as well as inhibiting its uptake. In this way, quinolinic acid self-potentiates its own toxicity. Furthermore, quinolinic acid <b>results</b> <b>in</b> changes of the biochemistry {{and structure of the}} astrocytes themselves, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> apoptotic response. A loss of astrocytes <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pro-inflammatory effect, further increasing the initial inflammatory response which initiates quinolinic acid production.|$|R
25|$|In November 2005, MLB {{owners and}} players {{approved}} even tougher penalties for positive tests than the ones in place during the 2005 season. Under the new rules, a first positive test would <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 50-game suspension, a second positive test would <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 100-game suspension, and a third positive test would <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lifetime suspension from MLB.|$|R
5|$|Although the Environment Agency {{have made}} {{plans for the}} regular winter flooding, still in recent years this has <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of villages— {{including}} Langport, Muchelney and Westonzoyland — being cut off. In November 2012, during the 2012 Great Britain and Ireland floods, after six days Somerset County Council-funded BARB rescue boats reached Muchelney on 29 November, rescuing nearly 100 people.|$|E
5|$|Arbitration {{between the}} company and its {{employees}} by the Indiana Public Service Commission <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> decision mostly favoring the company. The employees were permitted to unionize, guaranteed wage increases, a minimum monthly salary, and certain days off work. The company, however, was permitted to continue hiring non-union employees and to bar union membership solicitation on the company's property.|$|E
5|$|As a {{transport}} during World War I, Siboney made 17 transatlantic voyages for {{the navy}} carrying troops {{to and from}} Europe, and had the shortest average in-port turnaround time of all navy transports. During her maiden voyage, her steering gear malfunctioned which <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> collision between two other troopships in the convoy.|$|E
50|$|A {{leadership}} election may <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new leader, or may {{confirm the}} status quo. If {{the party in}} question is in government, {{the election of a}} new leader will <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new Prime Minister, Minister, Chief Minister; if the party is the opposition, the election of a new leader will <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> new Opposition Leader, Shadow Minister.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the third}} quarter, any hope of victory was {{seemingly}} out of reach for Virginia Tech. Three quick plays after the kickoff <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> first down before time ran out, but at {{the end of the}} third quarter, Florida State still had a 273 lead.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Richter {{suggested}} that the majority's legalistic approach, while yielding a workable construction of {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act, <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> dangerous situation in this case because the Act did not specifically address the situation of stateless persons, and the literal approach did not allow for gaps in the legislation to be filled.|$|E
5|$|Damming of the Canning caused {{dramatic}} flow reductions {{that significantly}} altered downstream aquatic macroinvertebrate communities. The {{lack of water}} flow has also <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor flushing effect below the dam wall. An excessive amount of nutrients from fertilizers and animal waste has caused algal blooms and eutrophication.|$|E
50|$|A ball {{played by}} a team over the {{opposing}} bye line <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> goal hit {{from the edge of}} the D, while a ball {{played by a}} team over their own line <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner. A ball hit over the sideline <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shy: a shinty shy involves the taker tossing the ball above his head and hitting the ball with the shaft of the caman, and the ball must be directly overhead when struck.|$|R
50|$|The last {{possibility}} in the termination step will <b>result</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> impurity <b>in</b> the final mixture; notably this <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> organic molecule with a longer carbon chain than the reactants.|$|R

5|$|Delrina also {{produced}} {{a set of}} screensavers, including one that <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> well-publicized lawsuit for copyright and trademark infringement (Berkeley Systems Inc. v.

5|$|Due to {{revenue-sharing}} agreements among Big East schools, Virginia Tech's selection by the Gator Bowl <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{payment of}} $1.7 million less than {{if it had}} been selected by a BCS bowl game. Instead of receiving about $3.5 million from the revenue agreement and bowl payout, Tech received about $1.8 million.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{variability}} of the mallard's genetic code, which gives it its vast interbreeding capability, mutations in the genes that decide plumage colour are very common and have <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wide variety of hybrids such as Brewer's duck (mallard × gadwall, Anas strepera).|$|E
50|$|Different {{types of}} anchors {{will leave the}} {{partners}} {{in one of three}} positions:1) the dancers are not individually centered (with <b>an</b> away resistance), <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> heavy active connection (sometime referred to as leverage; 2) partners will be individually centered, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> passive connection; 3) the follower's center point of balance will be slightly forward of being individually centered - <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> passive connection.|$|R
