50|$|Rickenbacker was {{the first}} {{manufacturer}} who began producing stereo bass guitars with a stereo output for each pickup section. The neck pickup had one output and the bridge pickup had one. Also Teisco produced a guitar with a stereo option. Teisco divided the two sections in the upper three strings and the lower three strings for each individual output. The Gittler guitar was an experimental guitar with six pickups, one for each string. The Go! Team has modified a Fender Telecaster with an additional rotated pickup for the upper string, causing a simulation of a one string bass sound.Gibson also created the HD.6X Pro guitar with The Hex Pickup that captures a separate signal for each individual string and sends it to the onboard analog/digital converter, which uses Gibson's digital transport technology to send the signal out of the guitar via Cat 5 Ethernet Cable. The output can be routed as a single summed mono signal to an amplifier or recording console. It can also send the E, A, and D strings to one amp or <b>recording</b> <b>channel</b> and the G, B, and high E to a separate amp or channel. Or it can send the output of all six individual strings to six different amps or channels. These six individualized outputs can used to create various effects.|$|E

In this paper, we present three methods of designing the IIR equalizer for magnetic <b>recording</b> <b>channels.</b> Results indicate that, when the number of equalizer taps is small (e. g., 3 taps) and the normalized recording density is high, the IIR equalizer designed based on the minimum mean-squared error approach performs much better than the FIR equalizer, especially in longitudinal <b>recording</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R

Recently, an iterative Monte Carlo algorithm to compute tight lower bounds on the capacity of intersymbol interference channels was proposed.

In this work, we extract data-dependent autoregressive noise channel models from simulated micromagnetic perpendicular <b>recording</b> <b>channel</b> waveforms, and then optimize the source distribution to compute capacity lower bounds of the channel models.
