The effect of bending stresses and curvature of the sheet on extensometer readings is also dealt with. An attempt is made to determine a rational design criteria for <b>rivet</b> <b>spacing</b> on stiffened thin sheet under compression. Design curves of <b>rivet</b> <b>spacing</b> against thickness are developed.

Results show that the reduction can be 40 percent or more from that of panels without rivet holes. The problem is particularly severe for materials of low yield strength and high fracture toughness and for designs with small <b>rivet</b> <b>spacing.</b> It can have a serious airworthiness implication if the effect of rivet holes is unaccounted for in the assessment of aircraft structural integrity...|$|E

All tests were constant amplitude tests with maximum stresses being representative for fuselage pressurization cycles and R-values of 0. 1. The parameters selected in the testing program were the stress level (sigma(sub max) = 14 and 16 ksi) and the <b>rivet</b> <b>spacing</b> (0. 75 and 1. 0 inch).

50|$|The {{ship was}} at least 14 metres long and {{contained}} a beam 3 metres in width. Clinker built with riveted construction, the <b>rivets</b> were <b>spaced</b> at intervals of approximately 140 millimetres {{and according to the}} watercolour painting, there were nine strakes a side. The rivets are of usual Anglo-Saxon style, being composed of iron and having domed heads and diamond roves. Excavators also uncovered fragments of a metal strip, at least 300 millimetres in length, which was vertically riveted to the outside of the hull. Filmer-Sankey noted that this could be interpreted as a chain plate that held the shrouds of a mast.|$|R

40|$|The {{method of}} {{riveting}} by forming the closing head under increasing pressure or {{by a series}} of hammer blows is investigated. The question as to the best edge distance, i. e. that distance from the rivet center to the plate edge below which it is unadvisable to go and, at the same time useless to go beyond, was examined. The slippage of plates which occurs under the effect of a certain stress, does not completely disappear on unloading. The elastic form change is essentially a function of the elasticity modulus, the slip modulus, the supporting moment, the <b>rivet</b> <b>spacing,</b> etc...|$|E
40|$|The {{specimens}} used in {{the present}} tests were cut from an actual airplane wing of the stressed-skin type. The specimens thus obtained were not representative of the usual type of laboratory specimens because the stiffeners were not exactly parallel nor evenly spaced and, in one case, the skin consisted of pieces of sheet of different thicknesses. The test data obtained indicate that the buckling strain of stiffened curved sheet can be computed with reasonable accuracy by the equation given by Wenzek. The ultimate loads of the specimens when tested as flat sheet were within +/- 11 percent of the product of the compressive yield strength and the cross-sectional area of the stiffeners. A <b>rivet</b> <b>spacing</b> equal to 98 times the sheet thickness was a source of weakness, and rivet spacings up to 36 times the sheet thickness appeared satisfactory...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the N. A. C.

Lead punching simulating 1 / 8 inch rivet heads were attached in full-span rows at a pitch of 1 inch at various chord positions. Tests were made at velocities varying from 40 to 120 miles per hour to investigate the scale effect. Rivets at the 5 percent chord position the upper surface of the airfoil produced the greatest increase in drag for a single row. Nine rows of rivets on both surfaces, simulating <b>rivet</b> <b>spacing</b> of multispan construction, increased the drag coefficients by a constant amount at velocities between 100 and 120 miles per hour. Accordingly, if rivets spaced the same as those on the test airfoil were used on a Clark Y wing of 300 square feet area and operated at 200 miles per hour, the drag would be increased over that for the smooth wing by 55 pounds and the power required would be increased by 29 horsepower...|$|E

This project focuses on how the strength varies with the <b>spacing</b> of <b>rivet</b> holes. Sometimes cracks can develop near the rivet holes in the presence of plastic deformation, which reduces the plate’s strength. The study was inspired by the University of Minnesota’s research on the failed gusset plate in the I- 35 W bridge collapse. Their research investigated the failure of the gusset plate as a yield-dominant failure (occurred by plastic collapse), and this research expands on that analysis but focuses on the possibility of a fracture-dominated failure.

40|$|A linear {{elastic stress}} {{analysis}} {{was made of}} a centrally cracked sheet stiffened by <b>riveted,</b> uniformly <b>spaced</b> and sized stringers. The stress intensity factor for the sheet and the load concentration factor for the most highly loaded stringer were determined for various numbers of broken stringers. A broken stringer causes the stress intensity factor to be very high when the crack tip is near the broken stringer, but causes little effect when the crack tip extends beyond several intact stringers. A broken stringer also causes {{an increase in the}} load concentration factor of the adjacent stringers. The calculated residual strengths and fatigue-crack-growth lives of a stiffened aluminum sheet with a broken stringer were only slightly less than a sheet with all intact stringers, and were still much higher than those of an unstiffened sheet...|$|R

40|$|The {{intermittently}} rivet fastened Rectangular Hollow Flange Channel Beam (RHFCB) {{is a new}} cold-formed {{hollow section}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} welded hollow flange channel beams. It is a monosymmetric channel section made by intermittently rivet fastening two torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges to a web plate. This process enables the end us-ers to choose an effective combination of different web and flange plate sizes to achieve op-timum design capacities. Recent research studies focused mainly on the shear behaviour of the most commonly used lipped channel beam and welded hollow flange beam sections with and without web openings. However, no research has been undertaken on the shear behav-iour and strength of rivet fastened RHFCBs with web openings. Hence a detailed experi-mental study involving 30 shear tests was undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of rivet fastened RHFCBs with circular web openings. Simply supported test spec-imens of RHFCB with aspect ratios of 1. 0 and 1. 5 were loaded at mid-span until failure. Comparison of experimental shear capacities with corresponding predictions from the cur-rent Australian cold-formed steel design rules showed that the current design rules are inad-equate for the shear design of rivet fastened RHFCBs with circular web openings. Signifi-cant improvements to web shear buckling occurred due to the presence of rectangular hollow flanges while considerable post-buckling strength is also observed. Such enhancements to the shear behaviour and capacity were achieved with a <b>rivet</b> <b>spacing</b> of 100 mm. Improved design rules are proposed for rivet fastened RHFCBs with circular web openings based on the test results. This paper presents the details of this experimental study and the results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Character {{segmentation}} is {{an important}} step in License Plate Recognition (LPR) system. There are many difficulties in this step, such as the influence of image noise, plate frame, <b>rivet,</b> the <b>space</b> mark, and so on. In natural language Number plate, there are additional problems faced to recognize the characters including Tamil characters. This work proposes a novel algorithm for character segmentation of degraded license plate based on Region pixel. Firstly, this algorithm performs preprocessing on the license plate, such as size normalization, uneven illumination correction, contrast enhancement, incline correction and edge enhancement; then, locates the character segments according to the vertical projection and merges the character segments that belong to the same character or splits the wider character segment according to the prior knowledge; finally, segments the characters according to the number and the width of the character segments. And last step convert the Tamil characters to equivalent English alphabets. This process is performed by the algorithm which takes the digital image as an input and gives textual form of license plate characters as an output. There are several methods used to perform this process. Keywords- (LPR). I...|$|R
40|$|Double pass {{retroreflection}} (D SightTM) optical {{systems for}} corrosion detection {{have been developed}} {{over the last three}} years, and commercial systems are already in the hands of customers. D Sight Aircraft Inspection Systems (DAIS) have initially been conceived as methods for rapidly locating defects in aircraft structures. While these defects were to be inspected by more traditional and slower methods, in the course of research studies initiated to support the DAIS development, it was realized that the bulging of skins between the rivets (pillowing) can be detected with DAIS at very low levels of corrosion thinning (less than 3 %). Modelling of corrosion pillowing was then undertaken using closed form and finite element methods. Riveted skin surface deformations were calculated at various levels of corrosion, and a ray tracing program was used to simulate DAIS images. Several factors affecting these images were investigated: relative and absolute skin thickness in the joint, <b>rivet</b> patterns and <b>spacing,</b> as well as surface reflectivity. Using the results obtained it is now possible to estimate the level of corrosion in a joint using simulated images and simple graphs, and this could be expressed in percent corrosion or stress terms.

40|$|Timber rivets, {{fasteners}} for glulam {{and heavy}} timber construction, {{have been used}} in Canada for about thirty years and recently were adopted by the U. S. National Design Specification for Wood Construction (NDS). Rivet connections can exhibit two failure modes, one of which is fundamentally different from those of other dowel fasteners. Failure can occur when a volume of wood bounded by the perimeter of the closely <b>spaced</b> <b>rivets</b> pulls out from the timber, or via a combination of fastener yielding and localized wood crushing. The code-sanctioned analysis of the wood failure mode for timber rivet connections is so complex that closed form solution is not possible and designers must refer to tabular data for solutions. The code approach to the fastener yield/wood crush failure mode is inconsistent with accepted approaches for other dowel fasteners. The simplified analysis presented here is based on wood failure modes combining shear and tension planes, and is presented in closed form for direct incorporation into design calculations without reference to tables. Results show that the simplified procedure is as accurate as the code-sanctioned procedure for prediction of experimentally measured strengths. Ongoing work will continue the efforts of previous researchers who considered the use of yield theory to predict the strength of connections when wood failure modes do not occur...|$|R
