25|$|Predators of Cape cobras {{include the}} honey badger (<b>ratel).</b> Other {{carnivorous}} mammals such as meerkats {{and a few}} species of mongoose often prey on the Cape cobra and are its main predators; they have a low susceptibility to its venom. Various birds of prey, including secretary birds and snake eagles may also prey on this species, and so do some other species of snakes.|$|E
25|$|SIBMAS is a Belgian amphibious {{infantry}} fighting vehicle. It was engineered {{from the}} same prototype as the South African <b>Ratel.</b> In appearance the vehicle is also similar to the Chinese WZ-523 armoured personnel carrier. The SIBMAS was developed between 1975 and 1976 at a department of the BN Constructions Ferroviaires et Metalliques in Nivelles. Production was on an order-by-order basis and commenced only for the Malaysian Army.|$|E

Along with Alex Buncombe and Wolfgang Reip, Chiyo won the 2015 series. The trio won the 1000 km Paul Ricard and {{finished}} third in the final race of the series at the Nürburgring, taking the title by three points over the Bentley M-Sport entry of Steven Kane, Andy Meyrick and Guy Smith. In doing so, Chiyo became the first Japanese driver to win a championship in a top-level sports car racing series organized by the Stéphane <b>Ratel</b> Organisation, and the first to win a major sports car racing championship of any kind outside of Asia.|$|E

25|$|When it {{originally}} began the anti-Spanish rebellion, Polisario {{was forced to}} capture its weapons individually, and transport them only by foot or camel. But the insurgents multiplied their arsenal and military sophistication after striking an alliance with Algeria in 1975. The modern SPLA is equipped mainly with outdated Soviet-manufactured weaponry, donated by Algeria. But its arsenals display a bewildering variety of material, much of it captured from Spanish, Mauritanian (Panhard AMLs) or Moroccan forces (Eland Mk7s, <b>Ratel</b> IFVs, AMX-13s, SK-105 Kürassiers) and made in France, the United States, South Africa, Austria or Britain. The SPLA has several armored units, composed of old tanks (T-55s, T-62s), somewhat more modern armored cars (EE-9 Cascavels, BRDM-2s), infantry fighting vehicles (BMP-1s, BTR-60s), rocket launchers (BM-21s) and halftracks. Surface-to-air missiles (anti-aircraft missiles, as SA-6s, SA-7s, SA-8s and SA-9s) have downed several Moroccan F-5 fighter jets, and helped compensate for the complete Moroccan control of the skies.|$|E
25|$|By {{the mid to}} late 1970s, the CM60A1 {{had been}} largely {{superseded}} by the similar Cloche Spéciale (CS) 60 which was distinguished by its ribbed barrel. The CS 60 utilized more ergonomic ammunition, which allowed for up to 56 mortar projectiles to be stored in the HE-60-7 turret, as opposed to the CM60A1's 43. Nevertheless, both mortar types continued to be marketed {{in a wide range of}} commercial turrets for the export market. In the late 1970s, the CM60A1 was successfully mounted on a variant of the Panhard M3 designated M3 VTT 60B. It was also offered for export with the Berliet VXB-170. South Africa later mounted K1 mortars on its fleet of <b>Ratel</b> infantry fighting vehicles, which were designated Ratel-60. A gun-mortar almost identical to the CM60A1 was produced by FN Herstal for the FN 4RM/62F AB armoured cars of the Belgian Gendarmerie.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Ratel's</b> design {{also gives}} far more {{consideration}} to protection against land mines than most armoured vehicles of its era, reflecting SADF experience and priorities. Like the Casspir and Buffel vehicles, {{the bottom of}} the hull is angled and reinforced so as to deflect mine blasts out to the sides. The <b>Ratel's</b> wheels, if damaged, are also much easier to repair or replace than tracks. The vehicle also has multiple doors and hatches; the two main doors are located in the vehicle's sides, but a small rear door and roof hatches allow the crew to exit the vehicle from many directions at once, or to more easily dismount under cover during an ambush.|$|R
2500|$|Following trials with {{a number}} of prototypes, a {{subsidiary}} of the Büssing company in 1971 commenced the development of the <b>Ratel</b> infantry fighting vehicle to meet the requirements of the South African Army. After evaluating several alternatives, including the EE-11 Urutu, Thyssen Henschel UR-416, and the Panhard M3, South Africa purchased the rights to Büssing's final prototype, then identified as the [...] "Springfield-Büssing Buffel". Büssing subsequently sold the same design to Belgium. The SIBMAS was still in the pre-production stage just as <b>Ratel</b> entered serial production. However, the obvious similarities between the two vehicles led some analysts to erroneously conclude their production was directly linked, and one was a licensed variant of the other.|$|E

2500|$|Attempts to bombard Ostend on 26 and 27 May were {{abandoned}} {{because of poor}} weather but on 4 June the bombardment ships sailed for the <b>Ratel</b> Bank off Ostend; the bombardment force was smaller and the covering force larger, since surprise was less likely. The Harwich Force provided a covering force of four light cruisers, a flotilla leader and eight destroyers off the Thornton Bank and a second wave of four light cruisers and eight destroyers to guard against an attack from the Schouwen Bank. The firing buoy and its bearing and range from the target were established using the same method as at Zeebrugge and the escorting ships formed a square around the bombardment ships. German destroyers were sighted east of the <b>Ratel</b> Bank at [...] by Lance and Lochinvar, which were steering towards Ostend to establish the range and bearing of the target from the sighting buoy. The German destroyers frustrated two attempts to enter the harbour, which left the fleet without sighting data and reliant on dead reckoning. At about [...] gunfire was heard {{from the direction of}} Tyrwhitt's covering force to the north and at about [...] the bombardment force motor launches began the smokescreen. At dawn the coast was visible, Bacon corrected the position by a bearing on Ostend Cathedral and the bombardment commenced at [...] German coastal guns replied within minutes of the bombardment from the monitors and fired accurately at Erebus and Terror but with no effect.|$|E

6000|$|One more Christmas sight we had, of course; {{and that}} sight I think I like {{as well as}} Bob himself at Christmas, and at all seasons. We went to a certain garden of delight, where, {{whatever}} your cares are, I think you can manage to forget some of them, and muse, and be not unhappy; to a garden beginning with a Z, which is as lively as Noah's ark; where the fox has brought his brush, and the cock has brought his comb, and the elephant has brought his trunk, and the kangaroo has brought his bag, and the condor his old white wig and black satin hood. On this day {{it was so cold}} that the white bears winked their pink eyes, as they plapped up and down by their pool, and seemed to say, [...] "Aha, this weather reminds us of dear home!" [...] "Cold! bah! I have got such a warm coat," [...] says brother Bruin, [...] "I don't mind"; and he laughs on his pole, and clucks down a bun. The squealing hyaenas gnashed their teeth and laughed at us quite refreshingly at their window; and, cold as it was, Tiger, Tiger, burning bright, glared at us red-hot through his bars, and snorted blasts of hell. The woolly camel leered at us quite kindly as he paced round his ring on his silent pads. We went to our favourite places. Our dear wambat came up, and had himself scratched very affably. Our fellow- creatures in the monkey room held out their little black hands, and piteously asked us for Christmas alms. Those darling alligators on their rock winked at us in the most friendly way. The solemn eagles sat alone, and scowled at us from their peaks; whilst little Tom <b>Ratel</b> tumbled over head and heels for us in his usual diverting manner. If I have cares in my mind, I come to the Zoo, and fancy they don't pass the gate. I recognise my friends, my enemies, in countless cages. I entertained the eagle, the vulture, the old billy-goat, and the black-pated, crimson-necked, blear-eyed, baggy, hook-beaked old marabou stork yesterday at dinner; and when Bob's aunt came to tea in the evening, and asked him what he had seen, he stepped up to her gravely, and said -- ...|$|E

50|$|In {{areas where}} the black-backed jackal is {{sympatric}} with the larger side-striped jackal, the former species aggressively drives out the latter from grassland habitats into woodlands.
