40|$|The {{ability to}} {{separate}} {{large volumes of}} mixed species based on atomic mass appears desirable {{for a variety of}} emerging applications with high societal impact. One possibility to meet this objective consists in leveraging mass differential effects in <b>rotating</b> <b>plasmas.</b> Beyond conventional centrifugation, <b>rotating</b> <b>plasmas</b> offer in principle additional ways to separate elements based on mass. Single ion orbits show that ion radial mass separation in a uniform magnetized plasma column can be achieved by applying a tailored electric potential profile across the column, or by driving a rotating magnetic field within the column. Furthermore, magnetic pressure and centrifugal effects can be combined in a non-uniform geometry to separate ions based on mass along the field lines. Practical application of these separation schemes hinges on the ability to produce the desirable electric and magnetic field configuration within the plasma column. Comment: Submitted to PPC...|$|R

40|$|At {{high energy}} densities any {{quantum field theory}} is {{expected}} to have an effective hydrodynamic description. When combined with the gravity/gauge duality an unified picture emerges, where gravity itself can have a formal holographic hydrodynamic description. This provides a powerful tool to study black holes in a hydrodynamic setup. We study the stability of plasma balls, holographic duals of Scherck-Schwarz (SS) AdS black holes. We find that <b>rotating</b> <b>plasma</b> balls are unstable against m-lobed perturbations for rotation rates higher than a critical value. This unstable mode signals a bifurcation to a new branch of non-axisymmetric stationary solutions which resemble a "peanut-like" <b>rotating</b> <b>plasma.</b> The gravitational dual of the <b>rotating</b> <b>plasma</b> ball must then be unstable and possibly decay to a non-axisymmetric long-lived SS AdS black hole. This instability provides therefore a mechanism that bounds the rotation of SS black holes. Our results are strictly valid for the SS AdS gravity theory dual to a SS gauge theory. The latter is particularly important because it shares common features with QCD, namely it is non-conformal, non-supersymmetric and has a confinement/deconfinement phase transition. We focus our analysis in 3 -dimensional plasmas dual to SS AdS_ 5 black holes, but many of our results should extend to higher dimensions and to other gauge theory/gravity dualities with confined/deconfined phases and admitting a fluid description.

We apply these results to the linear theory of the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) in collisionless plasmas. We show analytically and numerically how the general kinetic theory results derived here reduce in appropriate limits to previous results in the literature, including the low frequency guiding center (or "kinetic MHD") approximation, Hall MHD, and the gyro-viscous approximation. We revisit the cold plasma model of the MRI and show that, contrary to previous results, an initially unmagnetized collisionless plasma is linearly stable to axisymmetric perturbations in the cold plasma approximation. In addition to their application to astrophysical plasmas, our results provide a useful framework for assessing the linear stability of differentially <b>rotating</b> <b>plasmas</b> in laboratory experiments.
