One {{of the most famous}} methods of decoding VLC is optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) decoder based on directed graph search and soft-input theories. Because the computation complexity of this method is square to the bit numbers of a packet, many techniques have been proposed to reduce the complexity of VLC decoding. In this paper, we propose an error <b>restricted</b> <b>algorithm</b> of heuristic graph search in VLC decoding and compare it with existing algorithms. This paper also illustrates the relations between the reduced complexity and the increased error rates, and figures out a break point at which we can maximize decoding speed with the given error rate threshold.

40|$|A {{weighted}} finite-state {{machine with}} n tapes (n-WFSM) defines a rational relation on n strings. It is a generalization of weighted acceptors (one tape) and transducers (two tapes). After recalling some basic definitions about n-ary weighted rational relations and n-WFSMs, we summarize some central operations on these relations and machines, such as join and auto-intersection. Unfortunately, due to Post's Correspondence Problem, a fully general join or auto-intersection algorithm cannot exist. We recall a <b>restricted</b> <b>algorithm</b> {{for a class}} of n-WFSMs. Through a series of practical applications, we finally investigate the augmented descriptive power of n-WFSMs and their join, compared to classical transducers and their composition. Some applications are not feasible with the latter. The series includes: the morphological analysis of Semitic languages, the preservation of intermediate results in transducer cascades, the induction of morphological rules from corpora, the alignment of lexicon entries, the automatic extraction of acronyms and their meaning from corpora, {{and the search for}} cognates in a bilingual lexicon.

40|$|An {{important}} tool for analyzing metabolic pathways {{is being able}} to do homology searches, that is, for a given pattern network one would like to find occurrences of similar (sub) networks within a set of host networks. In the context of metabolic pathways, Pinter et al. [Bioinformatics, 2005] recently proposed to solve this computationally hard problem by restricting it to the case where both the pattern and host network are trees. This restriction, however, severely limits the applicability of their algorithm. Here, we propose a novel algorithm that does not restrict the topology of the host or pattern network in any way; instead, we exploit a natural property of metabolic networks that we call “local diversity property, ” which allows us to obtain a very fast and simple algorithm for the alignment of metabolic pathways. Experiments on a testbed of metabolic pathways extracted from the BIOCYC database indicate that our algorithm is much faster than the <b>restricted</b> <b>algorithm</b> of Pinter et al. and yet has a wider range of applicability and yields new biological insights. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} two hardwired {{solutions for}} repetitive padding, a performance <b>restricting</b> <b>algorithm</b> for real time MPEG- 4 execution. The first solution regards application specific implementations, the second regards general purpose processing. For the application specific implementations we propose a systolic array structure. To determine the chip area and speed, we have synthesized its VHDL models for two {{field-programmable gate array}} families—Xilinx and Altera. Depending on the implemented configuration, the unit can process between 77 K and 950 K macroblocks per second (MB/s) when mapped on FPGA chips containing less than 10 K logical gates and frequency capabilities below 100 MHz. The second approach regards an augmentation of a general-purpose arithmetic logical units with an extra functionality added to perform repetitive padding. At trivial hardware costs {{of a few hundred}} 2 2 AND-OR logic gates, we achieve an order of magnitude speed-up compared to nonaugmented general purpose processor padding. The proposed hardware solutions meet the requirements of all MPEG- 4 visual profile levels. Both approaches have been proven to be scalable and fit into different architectural concepts and operand widths.

40|$|Heuristic or {{informed}} {{search is}} very useful {{in quite a}} lot of applications. There are several algorithms performing heuristic search such as A ∗ (Hart, Nilsson and Raphael (1968)) IDA ∗ (Korf (1985)) and several memory <b>restricted</b> <b>algorithms</b> such as DBIDA ∗ and MEIDA ∗ (Eckerle and Schurier (1995)). Evaluating search algorithms used for heuristic state space problems the (n 2 − 1) –puzzle is often used as the only benchmark. This problem has two major advantages. It has a fairly easy optimistic heuristic (lower bound func-tion) and leads to a huge search space of (n 2 − 1) !/ 2 possible configurations. But on the other hand we find a lot of side effects that are not admirable. For example the shortest cycle length bigger than two is twelve such that using the good Manhattan estimate the danger of a re–expansion of the same node is small. There are no dead ends, such that even human solvers find good approximate solutions.
