Rotary hammers have such force, in fact, that the usual masonry bits are no longer adequate. Their smooth shanks would be pounded loose from the tool's chuck in a few seconds. Rotary hammers require special bits which lock into the <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> and continue spinning while smashing away.|$|E

50|$|The {{circular}} cross passages, {{each with}} an inner radius of 2.0 m, were built using the New Austrian Tunnelling method {{from the eastern}} to the western tunnel in each case.

The cross passages were finished during the construction phase as escape routes. The cross passages were built by a dedicated construction team.|$|R
2500|$|More {{advanced}} power units, usually labeled <b>rotary</b> <b>hammers,</b> tend to {{be larger}} and provide a bigger impact force by utilizing a technology called the [...] "electro-pneumatic" [...] (EP) hammering mechanism, because it is powered directly by electricity, instead of a separate air compressor. [...] An EP hammer has two pistons—a drive piston, and a flying piston. [...] An electric motor turns a crank, which moves the drive piston {{back and forth in}} a cylinder. [...] The flying piston is {{at the other end of}} the same cylinder. The pistons do not actually touch, but the air pressure in the EP cylinder allows for a much more efficient transfer of hammering energy than springs in the cam-action style tools. [...] The majority of modern <b>rotary</b> <b>hammers</b> as well as all electric-powered chipping guns or jack-hammers all utilize this EP technology. [...] Modern units allow the hammer and rotation functions to be used separately or in combination, i.e., hammer mode, drill mode, or both. When used in the hammer mode, the tool provides a drilling function similar to a jackhammer.|$|R

50|$|A {{standard}} {{hammer drill}} accepts 6 mm (1/4 inch) and 13 mm (1/2 inch) drill bits, while a <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> uses SDS or Spline Shank bits. These heavy bits are adept at pulverising the masonry and drill into this hard material with relative ease.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> drill (also {{known as}} a <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer,</b> roto hammer drill or masonry drill) {{combines}} a primary dedicated hammer mechanism with a separate rotation mechanism, and is used for more substantial material such as masonry or concrete. Generally, standard chucks and drills are inadequate and chucks such as SDS and carbide drills that {{have been designed to}} withstand the percussive forces are used. Some styles of this tool are intended for masonry drilling only and the hammer action cannot be disengaged. Other styles allow the drill to be used without the hammer action for normal drilling, or hammering to be used without rotation for chiselling. In 1813 Richard Trevithick designed a steam-driven rotary drill, also the first drill to be powered by steam.|$|E

2500|$|Hammer drills of both working {{principles}} are {{well suited for}} drilling holes in masonry or stone. They are also both used to drill holes in concrete footings to pin concrete wall forms and to drill holes in concrete floors to pin wall framing. Larger <b>rotary</b> <b>hammers</b> {{can also be used}} for [...] "doweling" [...] (repetitive drilling of large rebar anchor holes), and through-holes in concrete and masonry walls. [...] The hammering action helps to break up the masonry {{so that it can be}} removed by the drill bit's flutes.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} {{standard}} sizes of SDS: SDS-plus (or SDSplus or SDS+), SDS-Top and SDS-max. SDS-plus {{is the most}} common by count of tools manufactured, with masonry drills from 4 mm diameter to 30 mm (and from 5/32" [...] to 1-1/4") diameter ordinarily available. The shortest SDS-plus masonry drill bits are about 110 mm overall length, and the longest 1500 mm. SDS-max is more common for larger <b>rotary</b> <b>hammers</b> and chipping guns, and common sizes start at 1/2" [...] diameter up to 1-3/4" [...] diameter. Standard lengths are between 12" [...] - 21". SDS-Top has been largely phased out in North America and is not common except for older tools. Hilti's TE-S system is similar to these SDS systems, but is designed for chipping only (no rotation) in tools for applications larger than could be handled by SDS-Max (e.g. demolition of concrete walls or floors).|$|R

50|$|However, {{there is}} a big {{difference}} in cost. In the UK a cam hammer typically costs £12 or more, while a rotary/pneumatic costs £35 or more. In the US a typical hammer drill costs between $70 and $120, and a <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> between $150 and $500 (depending on bit size). For DIY use or to drill holes less than 13 mm (1/2 inch) in size, the hammer drill is most commonly used.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{researchers}} took it {{upon themselves}} to serve as crash test dummies. Colonel John Paul Stapp USAF propelled himself over 1000km/h on a rocket sled and stopped in 1.4 seconds. Lawrence Patrick, then a professor at Wayne State University, endured some 400 rides on a rocket sled in order to test the effects of rapid deceleration on the human body. He and his students allowed themselves to be smashed in the chest with heavy metal pendulums, impacted in the face by pneumatically driven <b>rotary</b> <b>hammers,</b> and sprayed with shattered glass to simulate window implosion. While admitting that it made him [...] "a little sore", Patrick has said that the research he and his students conducted was seminal in developing mathematical models against which further research could be compared. But while data from live testing was valuable, human subjects could not withstand tests which went past a certain degree of physical injury. To gather information about the causes and prevention of injuries and fatalities would require a different kind of subject.|$|R
2500|$|Hand {{engraving}} artists today {{employ a}} combination of hand push, pneumatic, <b>rotary,</b> or <b>hammer</b> and chisel methods. Hand push is still commonly used by modern hand engraving artists who create [...] "bulino" [...] style work, which is highly detailed and delicate, fine work; a great majority, if not all, traditional printmakers today rely solely upon hand push methods. Pneumatic systems greatly reduce the effort required for removing large amounts of metal, such as in deep relief engraving or Western bright cut techniques.|$|R
40|$|Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Winter 2006 In {{commercial}} and industrial building construction, hand held <b>rotary</b> impact <b>hammer</b> drills (RIHD) are used to bore holes in the underside of reinforced concrete slabs where fasteners are inserted to support piping and ventilation systems. Overhead drilling with RIHD causes extreme physical exertion and hand-arm vibrations while covering the worker in dust and debris. Overhead drilling with RIHD may lead to on-site injuries when the RIHD hits steel reinforcement beams in the concrete. The objective of this project is {{to design and fabricate}} a RIHD stand that reduces the physical exertion of the construction worker as well as increases the safety of their occupation. The design should help deflect dust and debris created by the drilling as well as to improve the efficiency of the overhead drilling process...|$|R

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the cam-type hammer drill, a rotary/pneumatic hammer drill accelerates only the bit. This is accomplished through a piston design, rather than a spinning cam. Rotary hammers have much less vibration and penetrate most building materials. They {{can also be used}} as [...] "drill only" [...] or as [...] "hammer only" [...] which extends their usefulness for tasks such as chipping brick or concrete. Hole drilling progress is greatly superior to cam-type hammer drills, and these drills are generally used for holes of 19 mm (3/4 inch) or greater in size. A typical application for a <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> drill is boring large holes for lag bolts in foundations, or installing large lead anchors in concrete for handrails or benches.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} reach an optimal drill effect by using a <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer,</b> it is {{necessary}} to control the two variables rotational speed and strike rate of the <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> {{in such a way that}} by applying minimal guidance and recoil power a maximal drill speed in the stone hole can be achieved. An optimal drill speed is attained for a certain combination of rotational speed and strike rate. Alterations of drill diameter and/or material hardness lead to a false adjustment of the system which has to be re-optimized by an intelligent re-adjustment of the two servo- controlled drives. For achieving a flexible and automatic adaptation of rotational speed and strike rate of the <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> to altered material and tool types, an adaptive multi-sensoric drive control upon the base of a self-learning neuro-fuzzy component has been developed by IITB in co-operation with an industrial partner...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the strikes, silambam also {{has a variety of}} locks called poottu. A fighter must always be careful while wielding the stick or they will be grappled and lose the fight. Locks can be used to disable the enemy or simply capture their weapon. Techniques called thirappu are used to counter the locks but these must be executed before being caught in a lock. Silambam also has many different types of avoiding an attack like blocking, parrying, enduring, <b>rotary</b> parrying, <b>hammering,</b> kolluvuthal (attacking and blocking simultaneously) and evasive moves such as sitting or kneeling, moving out, jumping high, etc. Against multiple attackers, silambam exponents do not hold out their sticks as they do in single combat. Instead they assume one of the numerous animal stances which makes it difficult for opponents to predict the next attack.|$|R
40|$|Drill & Blast is a {{commonly}} used excavation method {{for the construction}} of underground openings (e. g. tunnels, caverns) in hardrock conditions worldwide. Wear of the employed tools may take place during dif-ferent steps of the working cycle, affecting a wide range of machinery and materials. Although excavators, dump trucks or conveyor belts are also permanently exposed to the excavated rock mass and therefore un-dergoing geologically influenced wear, the wear of the rock cutting tools (i. e. drilling bits, excavator chisels, picks) is the most expensive wear phenomenon. Drilling equipment and bit tool wear Common blasthole diameters range from 38 to 48 mm and are typically drilled by use of hydraulic <b>rotary</b> percussive drilling <b>hammers</b> (impact power of about 15 to 20 kW). In most geological conditions, predomi-nantly button bits are used which consist of a number of cemented carbide buttons inserted and/or solded into holes of a steel body (Figure 1). The properties of the button bit can be adjusted effectively to the local cir-cumstances by variation of the amount of inserted buttons, button composition, button geometry, solding and steel quality or the bit's flushing system.

40|$|The term "rotary percussive auto-gopher" denotes a {{proposed}} {{addition to a}} family of apparatuses, based on ultrasonic/ sonic drill corers (USDCs), that have been described in numerous previous NASA Tech Briefs articles. These apparatuses have been designed, variously, for boring into, and/or acquiring samples of, rock or other hard, brittle materials of geological interest. In {{the case of the}} rotary percussive autogopher, the emphasis would be on developing an apparatus capable of penetrating to, and acquiring samples at, depths that could otherwise be reached only by use of much longer, heavier, conventional drilling-and-sampling apparatuses. To recapitulate from the prior articles about USDCs: A USDC can be characterized as a lightweight, low-power jackhammer in which a piezoelectrically driven actuator generates ultrasonic vibrations and is coupled to a tool bit through a free mass. The bouncing of the free mass between the actuator horn and the drill bit converts the actuator ultrasonic vibrations into sonic hammering of the drill bit. The combination of ultrasonic and sonic vibrations gives rise to a hammering action (and a resulting chiseling action {{at the tip of the}} tool bit) that is more effective for drilling than is the microhammering action of ultrasonic vibrations alone. The hammering and chiseling actions are so effective that the size of the axial force needed to make the tool bit advance into soil, rock, or another material of interest is much smaller than in ordinary <b>rotary</b> drilling, ordinary <b>hammering,</b> or ordinary steady pushing. The predecessor of the rotary percussive auto-gopher is an apparatus, now denoted an ultrasonic/sonic gopher and previously denoted an ultrasonic gopher, described in "Ultrasonic/ Sonic Mechanism for Drilling and Coring" (NPO- 30291), NASA Tech Briefs Vol. 27, No. 9 (September 2003), page 65. The ultrasonic/sonic gopher is intended for use mainly in acquiring cores. The name of the apparatus reflects the fact that, like a gopher, it periodically stops advancing at the end of the hole to bring excavated material (in this case, a core sample) to the surface, then re-enters the hole to resume the advance of the end of the hole. By use of a cable suspended from a reel on the surface, the gopher is lifted from the hole to remove a core sample, then lowered into the hole to resume the advance and acquire the next core sample...|$|R

40|$|The Piezoelectric <b>Rotary</b> <b>Hammer</b> Drill is {{designed}} to core through rock {{using a combination of}} rotation and high frequency hammering powered by a single piezoelectric actuator.

The purpose of this internship is to develop and test a prototype of the Piezoelectric <b>Rotary</b> <b>Hammer</b> Drill in order to verify the use of a horn with helical or angled cuts as a hammering and torque inducing mechanism. Through an iterative design process using models in ANSYS Finite Element software and a Mason's Equivalent Circuit model in MATLAB, a horn design was chosen for fabrication based on the predicted horn tip motion, electromechanical coupling, and neutral plane location. The design was then machined and a test bed assembled. The completed prototype has proven that a single piezoelectric actuator can be used to produce both rotation and hammering in a drill string {{through the use of a}} torque inducing horn.

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, it has been known that longlasting and intense hand-arm {{vibrations}} (HAV) can cause serious diseases, such as the Raynaud- / White Finger- Syndrome. In order to protect workers nowadays, the longterm use of tools such as a drill, grinder, <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> etc. underlie strict legal regulations. However, users rarely comply with these regulations because it is quite hard to manually estimate vibration intensity throughout the day. Therefore, we propose a wearable system that automatically counts the daily HAV exposure doses {{due to the fact}} that we are able to determine the currently used tool. With the implementation of AGIS, we demonstrate the technical feasibility of using the integrated microphone and accelerometer from a commercial smartwatch. In contrast to prior works, our approach does not require a technical modification of the smartwatch nor an instrumentation of the environment or the tool.

40|$|Rotary {{press forging}} (RPF) {{has been used}} in the last century, but it {{produces}} many defects in the forgings. The author has invented the <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> forging (RHF) process to reduce such defects. RHF is a multi-axes compression process where the material is partially and incrementally deformed by the action of several repeated hammering blows, while the produced deformation region is swept through the whole area of the workpiece. The aim of the present work is to study the effects of rotational speed on the forgings produced by RPF and RHF to compare between the two processes. It has been found that as the rotational speed increases the mushroom effect is constant in RHF while it is greater and increases in RPF. As the rotational speed increases, the twist angle increases in both RHF and RPF, but it is bigger in RPF. These results demonstrate the benefits of using RHF instead of RPF...|$|E
40|$|Subsurface {{penetration}} by coring, drilling or abrading is {{of great}} importance for {{a large number of}} space and earth applications. An Ultrasonic/Sonic Drill/Corer (USDC) has been in development at JPL's Nondestructive Evaluation and Advanced Actuators (NDEAA) lab as an adaptable tool for many of these applications. The USDC uses a novel drive mechanism to transform the high frequency ultrasonic or sonic vibrations of the tip of a horn into a lower frequency sonic hammering of a drill bit through an intermediate free-flying mass. The USDC device idea has been implemented at various scales from handheld drills to large diameter coring devices. A series of computer programs that model the function and performance of the USDC device were developed and were later integrated into an automated modeling package. The USDC has also evolved from a purely hammering drill to a <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> drill as the design requirements increased form small diameter shallow drilling to large diameter deep coring.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the methods of}} testing the materials subjected to static and dynamic tensile tests, presented for 10 GHMBA – E 620 bainitic steel. The tests were conducted on the MTS 810. 12 universal strength testing machine, a <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer,</b> a station especially designed for the conditions required for the Taylor test, an equipped ballistic pendulum and high-speed digital camera Phantom v 12. The data collected in the tests are necessary for strength calculations of these constructions.

Specific parameters and material constant values for the missile and the shield are accounted for in the equations. The parameters and constant values are either determined in experiments or ‘selected’, which is a significant issue in the case of high deformation speed. The final section presents examples of numerical simulations which enable the analysis of quick change processes which occur when a construction is subjected to strains due to strike with an object moving at a high speed, such as a 12. 7 mm calibre missile moving at approx. 1000 ms- 1. The knowledge of mechanical properties of materials is crucial in designing constructions exposed to direct fire and other dynamic effects.

40|$|The {{objective}} of drillhole ER- 12 - 1 {{was to determine}} the hydrogeology of paleozoic carbonate rocks and of the Eleana Formation, a regional aquitard, in an area potentially downgradient from underground nuclear testing conducted in nearby Rainier Mesa. This objective was addressed through the drilling of well ER- 12 - 1 at N 886, 640. 26 E 640, 538. 85 Nevada Central Coordinates. Drilling of the 1094 m (3588 ft) well began on July 19, 1991 and was completed on October 17, 1991. Drilling problems included hole deviation and hole instability that prevented the timely completion of this borehole. Drilling methods used include rotary tri-cone and <b>rotary</b> <b>hammer</b> drilling with conventional and reverse circulation using air/water, air/foam (Davis mix), and bentonite mud. Geologic cuttings and geophysical logs were obtained from the well. The rocks penetrated by the ER- 12 - 1 drillhole are a complex assemblage of Silurian, Devonian, and Mississippian sedimentary rocks that are bounded by numerous faults that show substantial stratigraphic offset. The final 7. 3 m (24 ft) of this hole penetrated an unusual intrusive rock of Cretaceous age. The geology of this borehole was substantially different from that expected, with the Tongue Wash Fault encountered at a much shallower depth, paleozoic rocks shuffled out of stratigraphic sequence, and the presence of an altered biotite-rich microporphyritic igneous rock {{at the bottom of the}} borehole. Conodont CAI analyses and rock pyrolysis analyses indicate that the carbonate rocks in ER- 12 - 1, as well as the intervening sheets of Eleana siltstone, have been thermally overprinted following movement on the faults that separate them. The probable source of heat for this thermal disturbance is the microporphyritic intrusion encountered at the bottom of the hole, and its age establishes that the major fault activity must have occurred prior to 102. 3 + 0. 5 Ma (middle Cretaceous) ...|$|E
