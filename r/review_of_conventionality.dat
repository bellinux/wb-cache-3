40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to show the importance of AO No. 21 / 2014 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, via control <b>of</b> <b>conventionality,</b> as a way to ensure the protection of the refugee children's rights in Brazil. To this end, a bibliographical and documentary research on international and national doctrine, legislation and jurisprudence was made. It was found that only after the Second World War, the rights of refugees began to receive international attention. So, too, it was found that the right to asylum is a fundamental right, whose interpretation should be performed via control <b>of</b> <b>conventionality,</b> in the light of international human rights, such as the Convention Relating of the status of Refugees, adopted in 1951, and the OC nº 21 / 2014  of the Inter-American Court of Human rights.

In the case of Special Theory of Relativity (STR) it is commonly believed that {{it is based on the}} Michelson{Morley experiment [1].

The problem of the equality of the "one way " velocities is still under extensive discussion [2, 3]. In all existing literature the discussion <b>of</b> <b>conventionality</b> in STR is concentrated around the choice of clock's synchronization.

40|$|Words are {{powerful}} communicative tools because <b>of</b> <b>conventionality</b> - their meanings are shared among same language users. Although evidence demonstrates that an understanding <b>of</b> <b>conventionality</b> is present early in life, this work {{has focused on}} infants being raised in English-speaking monolingual environments. As such, {{little is known about}} the role that experience in multilingual environments plays in the development of an understanding <b>of</b> <b>conventionality.</b> We addressed this gap with 13 -month-old infants regularly exposed to more than one language. Infants were familiarized to two speakers who either spoke the same (English), or different (French vs. English) languages. Next, infants were habituated to a video in which one of the speakers provided a new word and selected one of two unfamiliar objects. Infants were then shown test events in which the other speaker provided the same label and selected either the same object or a different object. Our results demonstrate that exposure to at least one other language influences infants’ expectations about conventionality. Unlike monolinguals, bilingual infants do not assume that word meanings are shared across speakers who use the same language. Interestingly, when shown speakers who use different languages, bilingual infants looked longer towards the test trials in which the second speaker labeled the object consistently with the first speaker. This finding suggests that exposure to multiple languages enhances infants’ understanding that speakers who use different languages should not use the same word for the same object. This is the first known evidence that experience in multilingual environments influences infants’ expectations surrounding the shared nature of word meanings. An increased sensitivity to the constraints <b>of</b> <b>conventionality</b> represents a fairly sophisticated understanding of language as a conventional system and may shape bilingual infants’ language development in a number of important ways...|$|R

Due to the critical role <b>of</b> <b>conventionality</b> in influencing implicature strength and because of the two types <b>of</b> theorized <b>conventionality</b> (i.e., conventions <b>of</b> language and conventions of usage), pragmatic comprehension ability is operationalized as the ability to correctly interpret the meaning of three types of implicatures, i.e., implicatures conveyed through conventionalized linguistic forms (Lin), fixed discourse patterns (Dis), and non-conventionalized utterances (Non).|$|R

40|$|Despite a broad-range title {{the paper}} settles for the related {{issue of whether}} the Special Theory of Relativity (STR) {{necessarily}} advocates the demise of an ontological difference between past and future events, between past and future in general. In the jargon of H. Stein: are we forced, {{within the framework of}} the STR, to choose only between ‘solipsism’ and ‘determinism’ exclusively? A special emphasis is placed on the role that the <b>conventionality</b> <b>of</b> simultaneity plays in the STR with regards to this question. The standard arguments rely on the relativity of simultaneity, the claim that the STR negates the existence of a universal ‘present’ that divides the ‘past’ and the ‘future’, so as to conclude that there is no ontological difference between past and future events, that both are equally determined/real (‘determinism’). This often neglects the fact that to establish the ontological claims related to relativity of simultaneity, one must first resolve the issues <b>of</b> <b>conventionality</b> <b>of</b> simultaneity within the STR. The paper will aim to show that by addressing the issue <b>of</b> <b>conventionality</b> from Dummett’s ‘purely philosophical’ determination of the difference between the past and the future, we develop an understanding of the said difference, {{within the framework of the}} STR, beyond the (unwanted) strict ontological dichotomy of ‘solipsism/determinism’, given that the criterion that is provided by the STR is understood as epistemic and not ontological...|$|R

40|$|In this work, Einstein’s view of {{geometry}} {{as physical}} geometry is {{taken into account}} in the analysis of diverse issues related to the notions of inertial motion and inertial reference frame. Einstein’s physical geometry enables a non-conventional view on Euclidean geometry (as the geometry associated to inertial motion and inertial reference frames) and on the uniform time. Also, by taking into account the implications of the view of geometry as a physical geometry, it is presented a critical reassessment of the so-called boostability assumption (implicit according to Einstein in the formulation of the theory) and also of ‘alternative’ derivations of the Lorentz transformations that do {{not take into account the}} so-called ‘light postulate’. Finally it is addressed the issue <b>of</b> the eventual <b>conventionality</b> <b>of</b> the one-way speed of light or, what is the same, the <b>conventionality</b> <b>of</b> distant simultaneity (within the same inertial reference frame). It turns out that it is possible to see the (possible) <b>conventionality</b> <b>of</b> distant simultaneity as a case <b>of</b> <b>conventionality</b> <b>of</b> geometry (in Einstein’s reinterpretation of Poincaré’s views). By taking into account synchronization procedures that do not make reference to light propagation (which is necessary in the derivation of the Lorentz transformations without the ‘light postulate’), it can be shown that the synchronization of distant clocks does not need any conventional element. This implies that the whole of chronogeometry (and because of this the physical part of the theory) does not have any conventional element in it, and it is a physical chronogeometry...|$|R

3000|$|The {{explanation}} inference in {{this study}} rests upon two assumptions showing that test performance is attributable to pragmatic comprehension ability. First, the assumption that test performance varies according to known factors affecting pragmatic comprehension (Assumption 2) can be supported by demonstrating the well-documented effects of proficiency on pragmatic comprehension (e.g., Roever 2005, 2006; Taguchi 2008, 2009; Taguchi et al. 2013). Second, {{the assumption that the}} internal structure of the test corresponds to a theoretical view of the construct of pragmatic comprehension ability (Assumption 3) can be backed by three lines of evidence based on theoretical predictions and existing empirical findings: (a) because the three types of implicature are conceptualized to represent different facets of a shared construct, one can expect strong relationships in test performance between them; (b) according to the pragmatics theories reviewed earlier, the varying degrees <b>of</b> <b>conventionality</b> (e.g., with or without conventionalized features) and the different kinds <b>of</b> <b>conventionality</b> (i.e., conventions <b>of</b> language and conventions of use) require different levels of processing effort, leading to variations in test performance; and (c) comprehension of the three types of implicature likely draws on different knowledge, processes, and strategies because of the differences in conventionality (e.g., Taguchi 2008).

40|$|A problem widely {{discussed}} among psychologists, {{philosophers and}} linguists {{is whether there}} are aspects <b>of</b> <b>conventionality</b> in speech acts. Although in identifying the various components, which are interdependent among themselves, only single illocutory acts and, to more reason, locutory acts are performed within the utterance, it is still controversial whether {{at the level of}} langue there is correspondance between aspects <b>of</b> <b>conventionality</b> and these acts, as far as the linguistic means utilised to perform them are conventional. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss the illocutionary force devices of the grammatical features of the interrogative parentheticals (no?, vero?, etc.) in Italian. Their syntactic distribution and the semantic properties they present seem to bear very crucially on concepts which belong to speech acts. Moreover, such parentheticals can be accounted for by analysing their clusters of grammatical features at two levels of linguistic description. Such representation of illocutionary force devices allows to bring under a single generalisation aspects concerning both the form of the sentences and the related functions, allowing to ground and unify a number of different properties of grammatical structure. However, such an analysis has some consequences for the representations of illocutionary force, as expressed by grammatical means, which would not necessarily include rules for systematically exploiting certain ambiguities and vagueness...|$|R
