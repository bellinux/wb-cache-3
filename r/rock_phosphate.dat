Further, global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high-yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice, wheat, and corn were introduced {{as a part of}} the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution exported the technologies (including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen) of the developed world to the developing world.

30|$|<b>Phosphate</b> <b>rock</b> {{reactivity}} is {{a measure}} of the rate of dissolution of <b>phosphate</b> <b>rocks</b> under standard laboratory conditions or in a given soil and under given field conditions (Rajan et al. 1996). The dissolution rate of <b>phosphate</b> <b>rocks</b> is mostly affected by soil properties and plant characters. The chemical composition and particle size of <b>phosphate</b> <b>rocks</b> control their reactivity. Sedimentary origin <b>phosphate</b> <b>rocks</b> are generally most reactive and suitable for direct application. Calcium carbonate is the most abundant accessory mineral in <b>phosphate</b> <b>rocks.</b> As calcium carbonate is more soluble than the most chemically reactive phosphate mineral, its dissolution increases the calcium content and pH at the phosphate mineral surface. So, calcium carbonate can reduce the rate of <b>phosphate</b> <b>rock</b> dissolution in some soils.|$|R

The two trials were with eight different treatment combinations. Among various treatments, fish and Chironomid larvae contributed to some extent in increasing the available sediment phosphate content which in turn increased the soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) of overlying water.
