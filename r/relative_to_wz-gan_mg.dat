40|$|Frontal EEG {{asymmetry}} {{shifting from}} baseline was examined in adults and infants exposed to lavender and rosemary by reanalyzing previously published data, using techniques {{different from those}} utilized in the original two studies. Results from Study 1 on 39 adults revealed significant EEG shifting in the lavender group, with greater relative left frontal EEG activation (associated with greater approach behavior and less depressed affect). The participants in the two aroma groups were further grouped by those with greater baseline, <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> left frontal EEG activation, versus those with a greater baseline, <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> right frontal activation. Collapsing across aroma groups, those with greater baseline, <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> right frontal activation, shifted left during the aroma.

Study 2 on 27 full-term newborns revealed no significant shifts in asymmetry in either aroma group. However, when the aroma groups were collapsed, the right frontal EEG group exhibited significant shifting <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> left frontal EEG activation.
