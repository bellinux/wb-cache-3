5|$|On December 31, 2008, Bellaire police {{officers}} confronted Robbie Tolan, {{the son of}} former Major League Baseball player Bobby Tolan, in the driveway of his house at the 800 block of Woodstock. Officers suspected Tolan, who was unarmed, of stealing a sports utility vehicle in the driveway and shot Tolan in the chest; Tolan's family owned the vehicle. Tolan was hospitalized with injuries to one lung and a liver. The incident sparked allegations of <b>racial</b> <b>profiling.</b> Members of minority groups reported that Bellaire police racially profiled people. In 2002, José Cruz, Jr., son of baseball player José Cruz, was stopped since his vehicle was missing a front license plate. He was arrested by Bellaire police and spent one night in jail after Bellaire law enforcement {{told him that he}} had a warrant for his arrest. The Houston Chronicle said that the Bellaire police decision to arrest Cruz was a mistake. In January 2009, Cruz accused the police of <b>racial</b> <b>profiling.</b> Mayor Cindy Siegel said that she was unaware of <b>racial</b> <b>profiling</b> by police. Siegel announced that the city will investigate <b>racial</b> <b>profiling</b> and hire an independent consultant to look at traffic stop data. The local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch said that it established a pact with the City of Bellaire; people may report civil rights violations from Bellaire Police to the branch if the people do not wish to contact the City of Bellaire. However, the NAACP branch has not yet provided the city with any civil rights violations. On April 6, 2009, a Harris County grand jury indicted Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton, the police officer, for aggravated assault by a public servant. If convicted, Cotton could face up to life in prison. In addition the family sued the police department and the police officer. The upcoming trial in Harris County District Court on criminal felony charges against Cotton began on January 25, 2010. Jury selection was scheduled to begin on May 3, 2010. The officer was found not guilty in his criminal trial in May 2010.|$|E

40|$|In {{the ongoing}} {{struggle}} to ingrain transformation throughout South Africa, {{one of the}} aspects that still needs attention is the demographic (or equity) profile of institutions. While demographics {{are not the only}} aspect of transformation, it {{remains one of the most}} important factors. It is particularly difficult to gauge the improvement in equity profile over a defined period. As an example, consider a hypothetical organisation X. We assume that X’s <b>racial</b> <b>profile</b> constituted 70 % Black African, 2 % Coloured, 4 % Indian and 24 % White staff in 2004. We further assume that the <b>racial</b> <b>profile</b> changed to 72 % Black African, 1 % Coloured, 2 % Indian and 25 % White staff in 2009. While the percentage of Black African staff increased, so did the percentage of White staff. By simply looking at the percentage change in each category, we cannot determine whether the <b>racial</b> <b>profile</b> of X improved or worsened from 2004 to 2009. In the above example we were concerned with the improvement in <b>racial</b> <b>profile</b> for a single organisation. However, one could also consider the relative <b>racial</b> or gender <b>profiles</b> of different organisations (either in a particular sector or nationally). A similar difficulty would be encountered in answering this latter question. We show how a single numerical quantity – the Equity Index – will be able to answer these questions unambiguously. The Equity Index In mathematics, a simple way to determine how far a particular data point is from another is to calculate the distance between the two points.

40|$|South Africa has {{undergone}} transformation {{since the end}} of apartheid governance in 1994. Legislatively enforced, this transformation has permeated most sectors of society, including higher education. Questions remain, however, {{about the extent to which}} transformation has occurred in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in general, and across the academic staff body in HEIs in particular. In this study, we examine the transformation of academic staff profiles at HEIs throughout the country. Initially, we graph the <b>racial</b> <b>profile</b> of academics across multiple positions (junior lecturer to professor) from 2005 to 2013. We then use correlational analysis to identify which characteristics of universities in South Africa can be used to explain the racial inequities evident in South African HEIs. Our results indicate that world university ranking; percentage black African staff; percentage black African student body; and whether the university is 'historically disadvantaged', all influence the <b>racial</b> <b>profile</b> of the academic staff body to varying degrees. The size of the overall staff and study body does not appear to influence the <b>racial</b> <b>profile</b> of universities' staff component. We conclude that transformation of the academic staff body of HEIs in South Africa is indeed occurring, albeit slowly. Rather than seeing this as a negative, we argue that the pace of 'academic' transformation in the country needs to be interpreted within the framework of academic governance.

5|$|The Greek Town Riot in 1909 flared after {{increased}} Greek immigration, Greeks' {{working as}} strikebreakers, and {{the killing of}} an Irish policeman provoked violence among earlier immigrants such as ethnic Irish. That mob violence forced the Greek immigrant population to flee from the city. By 1910, 53.7% of Omaha's residents and 64.2% of South Omaha's residents were foreign born or {{had at least one}} parent born outside of America. Six years after the Greek Town Riot, in 1915, a Mexican immigrant named Juan Gonzalez was killed by a mob near Scribner, a town in the Greater Omaha metropolitan area. The event occurred after an Omaha Police Department officer was investigating a criminal operation selling goods stolen from the nearby railroad yards. <b>Racial</b> <b>profiling</b> targeted Gonzalez as the culprit. After escaping the city, he was trapped along the Elkhorn River, where the mob, including several policemen from Omaha, shot him more than twenty times. Afterward it was discovered that Gonzalez was unarmed, and that he had a reliable alibi for the time of the murder. Nobody was ever indicted for his killing. In the fall of 1919, following Red Summer, postwar social and economic tensions, the earlier hiring of blacks as strikebreakers, and job uncertainty contributed to a mob from South Omaha lynching Willy Brown and the ensuing Omaha Race Riot. Trying to defend Brown, the city's mayor, Edward Parsons Smith, was lynched also, surviving only after a quick rescue.|$|E

Balaram also questions the lack of similarity between him and Alu, since phrenology, especially when used in criminology or for <b>racial</b> <b>profiles,</b> determined inherited character as well as cranial shapes. “Wasn’t that why Lombroso was so celebrated – for demonstrating the hereditary nature of character?

40|$|Can {{understanding}} promote adaptive functioning among adolescents? The following dissertation project {{considered this}} question {{in the context of}} African American adolescents’ experiences with racial discrimination. This work addressed ways in which youth understand the meaning and functioning of race in their lives and whether these processes can be an adaptive response to race-based adversity. Using secondary survey data, I 1) developed two measures of racial cognition (racial identity exploration and critical race consciousness), 2) used a cluster analysis approach to examine patterns across these forms of racial cognition, creating <b>racial</b> cognitive <b>profiles</b> and 3) assessed associations between the <b>racial</b> cognitive <b>profiles,</b> school-based <b>racial</b> discrimination and adjustment in a sample of 11 th grade African American students (N = 401, 51 % male). The present study addressed the theoretical and empirical development of constructs assessing socio-cognitive processes related to the meaning and function of race, particularly as they may occur during adolescence among African American adolescent in school settings. I also examined way in which these types of processes are associated with academic and psychological adjustment in the context of experiencing racial discrimination. The primary study objectives were to 1) describe the direct association of youths’ racial identity believes, racial identity exploration and critical race consciousness with psychological and academic adjustment outcomes, 2) identify and describe patterns across these constructs, 3) examine whether <b>racial</b> cognitive <b>profile</b> groups vary in their academic and psychological adjustment outcomes, and 4) evaluate whether the effects of school-based discrimination on adjustment outcomes vary among youth with different <b>racial</b> cognitive <b>profiles.</b> Three cluster groups were identified: 1) Alienated/Disengaged, 2) Buffering/Aware and 3) Idealized/Questioning. Having a positive connection to one’s racial group and examining the meaning of one’s racial experiences and background, positively contributed to adjustment. Findings also support that a lack of racial awareness (or critical race consciousness) may be a risk factor when not also coupled with a strong, positive connection to one’s racial group or racial identity exploration...|$|R
