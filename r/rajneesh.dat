5|$|Prosecution of {{the conspirators}} began in 1990, when {{a federal grand}} jury brought indictments against several of the key players. Some had fled the country, and {{extradition}} proceedings against the perpetrators and subsequent prosecution and conviction was not completed for sixteen years. The final conspirator was convicted in 2006, when Catherine Jane Stork agreed to return to the United States from Germany in order to be allowed to visit her ill son in Australia. Eight perpetrators received sentences ranging from five years probation to five years in federal prison and an additional member of the <b>Rajneesh</b> commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy. <b>Rajneesh</b> was never prosecuted in relation to the conspiracy, and left the United States after pleading guilty to immigration fraud and agreeing not to reenter the country without permission from the U.S. Attorney General.|$|E

5|$|Seven {{followers}} (called Rajneeshees) of charismatic leader Bhagwan Shree <b>Rajneesh</b> (now {{known as}} Osho), {{were convicted of}} a 1985 conspiracy to assassinate Charles Turner, and an additional unindicted eighth member of the <b>Rajneesh</b> commune pleaded guilty to murder conspiracy. The perpetrators were high-ranking followers within the Rajneeshee organization. Prosecutors in the case stated that the perpetrators had planned to murder Turner after he was appointed to head {{an investigation into the}} group's activities in Rajneeshpuram, Oregon. Turner's investigation focused on sham marriages organized by the group, as well as other illegal activities including immigration fraud, and he later headed the federal prosecution relating to the 1984 Rajneeshee bioterror attack in The Dalles, Oregon. Oregon Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer was also involved in investigations of the group, working alongside Turner.|$|E

5|$|The conspirators practiced {{different}} ways of murdering Turner. According to informant statements to law enforcement, one of the conspirators was to pretend there was car trouble, and the others would then approach Turner with their guns. Informants later told law enforcement officials that the conspirators intended to hide out at an international network of <b>Rajneesh</b> communes if the plan was successful. According to The Oregonian the assassinations were not carried out because Ma Anand Sheela became distracted by political power plays within the <b>Rajneesh</b> commune {{and other members of}} the organization who were trying to remove her from her position within the group. And according to witness information, Ma Anand Sheela was persuaded not to carry out this action through conversations with Carol Matthews, who stated to her that this was not a solution in any way and would be a horrendous action.|$|E

He enrolled in the Haverstock School in north London, but had trouble during his teen years with drugs and alcohol. He had difficult relations with his stepfather, and had not spent much time with him prior to the move to London.

5|$|At a {{press conference}} in September 1985, <b>Rajneesh</b> accused several of his {{followers}} of participation in this and other crimes, including an aborted plan in 1985 to assassinate a United States Attorney, and he asked State and Federal authorities to investigate. Oregon Attorney General David B. Frohnmayer set up an Interagency Task Force, composed of Oregon State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and executed search warrants in Rajneeshpuram. A sample of bacteria matching the contaminant that had sickened the town residents was found in a Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory. Two leading Rajneeshpuram officials were convicted on charges of attempted murder and served 29months of 20-year sentences in a minimum-security federal prison.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 1985, Congressman James H.

At a series of press conferences in September 1985, <b>Rajneesh</b> accused several of his recently departed lieutenants of involvement in this and other crimes, including the poisoning of Mike Sullivan, a Jefferson County district attorney, and asked state and federal authorities to investigate his allegations. The assassination plot was uncovered by federal law enforcement {{as a result of the}} ensuing investigation into activities at Rajneeshpuram. Turner was never physically harmed, and had retired by 1995.|$|E
5|$|Having {{previously}} gained {{political control}} of Antelope, Oregon, <b>Rajneesh's</b> followers, who were based in nearby Rajneeshpuram, sought election {{to two of}} the three seats on the Wasco County Circuit Court that were up for election in November 1984. Fearing they would not gain enough votes, Rajneeshpuram officials decided to incapacitate voters in The Dalles, the largest population center in Wasco County. The chosen biological agent was Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, which was first delivered through glasses of water to two County Commissioners and then, on a larger scale, at salad bars and in salad dressing.|$|R

5|$|Hergé {{initially}} titled {{this new}} work Tintin et les Faussaires ("Tintin and the Forgers") before changing this working title to Tintin et L'Alph-Art. The story's main antagonist, Endaddine Akass, {{was based on}} a real-life art forger, Fernand Legros, whom Hergé had learned about through reading a biography of him. The Akass character was also influenced by an article about the Indian guru <b>Rajneesh</b> which Hergé had read in a December 1982 edition of the Paris Match. In Hergé's notes, he included the idea of revealing that Akass was Tintin's nemesis, Rastapopoulos, in disguise, with Farr believing that this plot twist would have been revealed had Hergé completed the story. Conversely, Harry Thompson suggested that Hergé had dropped Rastapopolous from the story in 1980. Hergé's notes reveal that he considered various different names for the artist character, including Ramon Hasj and Ramo Nasj, before settling on Ramo Nash. Similarly, he had initially debated whether Nash should be a painter or a sculptor, before deciding on the latter.|$|E
25|$|During his {{residence}} in Rajneeshpuram, <b>Rajneesh</b> also dictated three books {{under the influence}} of nitrous oxide administered to him by his private dentist: Glimpses of a Golden Childhood, Notes of a Madman and Books I Have Loved.

50|$|The {{city was}} {{located on the}} site of a 64229 acre Central Oregon {{property}} known as the Big Muddy Ranch, which was purchased in 1981 for $5.75 million ($ in today's dollars). Within three years, the neo-sannyasins (<b>Rajneesh's</b> followers, also termed Rajneeshees in contemporaneous press reports) developed a community, turning the ranch from an empty rural property into a city of up to 7,000 people, complete with typical urban infrastructure such as a fire department, police, restaurants, malls, townhouses, a 4200 ft airstrip, a public transport system using buses, a sewage reclamation plant and a reservoir.

500|$|Local {{residents}} {{suspected that}} <b>Rajneesh's</b> followers {{were behind the}} poisonings. They turned out in droves on election day to prevent the organization from winning any county positions, thus rendering the plot unsuccessful. The Rajneeshees eventually withdrew their candidate from the November 1984 ballot. Only 239 of the commune's 7,000residents voted; most were not US citizens and could not vote. The outbreak cost local restaurants {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars and health officials shut down the salad bars of the affected establishments. Some residents feared further attacks and stayed at home. One resident said: [...] "People were so horrified and scared. People wouldn't go out, they wouldn't go out alone. People were becoming prisoners." ...|$|R

Byron had been recruited to join the <b>Rajneesh</b> movement by her daughter, Barbara. She traveled to India to join her daughter and the organization. Byron provided over US$300,000 to the organization, {{and some of the}} money was used to buy an armored Rolls Royce for <b>Rajneesh.</b> Byron spoke to the legal leader of the organization, Ma Anand Sheela (Sheela Silverman), and requested that her money be returned, asserting that it was a loan. Sheela reportedly told her that the money would be returned to her once the group moved to Oregon. Byron followed the organization to its location in Oregon, known as Rajneeshpuram, and requested through an attorney that her money be returned. In 1985, she filed a lawsuit against the organization in federal court, in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon.|$|E
25|$|Rajneeshee {{attorney}} Swami Prem Niren (Philip J.

He attempted to block execution of the jury judgment against the organization. Judge Owen Panner ruled that the judgment and collateral for paying it would remain, due to the uncertain financial circumstances of the <b>Rajneesh</b> organization. Byron received $975,000 of the judgment on November 27, 1985. Judge Panner refused to order Byron to return the funds to the <b>Rajneesh</b> organization.|$|E
25|$|Helen C. Byron, {{originally}} from Santa Fe, New Mexico, was recruited into the <b>Rajneesh</b> movement by her daughter Barbara J. Byron, {{who had previously}} joined the group in India.

500|$|The {{mayor of}} Rajneeshpuram, David Berry Knapp (known as Swami Krishna Deva or KD), turned state's {{evidence}} and gave {{an account of}} {{his knowledge of the}} Salmonella attack to the FBI. He claimed that Sheela said [...] "she had talked with [...] about the plot to decrease voter turnout in The Dalles by making people sick. Sheela said that [...] commented that it was best not to hurt people, but if a few died not to worry." [...] In Miller's , this statement is attributed to Sheela: According to KD's testimony, she played doubters a tape of <b>Rajneesh's</b> muffled voice saying, [...] "if it was necessary to do things to preserve [...] vision, then do it," [...] and interpreted this to mean that murder in his name was fine, telling doubters [...] "not to worry" [...] if a few people had to die.
