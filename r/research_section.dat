5|$|The Operations <b>Research</b> <b>Section</b> (ORS) {{was also}} set up {{in light of the}} success of such {{programs}} in Fighter and Bomber Commands. Many scientists were appointed to the ORS Coastal Command. Some acted as advisors to Air Marshal Bowhill. Four sections were set up; planned flying and maintenance, ASO, A/S, and weather and navigation. Resources were spread evenly. However, A/S received more attention. The rest did not receive close attention until 1943, when the U-boats had been contained and a certain degree of ascendancy achieved.|$|E
5|$|There are no exact figures {{regarding}} German tank {{losses in}} Normandy. Approximately 2,300 tanks and assault guns {{were committed to}} the battle, of which only 100 to 120 crossed the Seine {{at the end of}} the campaign. While German forces reported only 481 tanks destroyed between D-day and 31 July, research conducted by No. 2 Operational <b>Research</b> <b>Section</b> of 21st Army Group indicates that the Allies destroyed around 550 tanks in June and July and another 500 in August, for a total of 1,050 tanks destroyed by enemy action, including 100 destroyed by aircraft. Luftwaffe losses amounted to 2,127 aircraft. By the end of the Normandy campaign, 55 German divisions (42 infantry and 13 panzer) had been rendered combat ineffective; seven of these were disbanded. By September, OB West had only 13 infantry divisions, 3 panzer divisions, and 2 panzer brigades rated as combat effective.|$|E

A student discussion group, the Malayan Forum, was organised in 1948 with Goh as the founding chairman. Goh graduated with first class honours in economics in 1951, and won the William Farr Prize for achieving the highest marks in statistics. Upon {{his return to the}} Department of Social Welfare, he was appointed assistant secretary of its <b>Research</b> <b>Section.</b> In 1952, together with fellow civil servant Kenneth M.

25|$|In 1970 the {{structure}} of the faculty began to be developed, and by September 1971 it was operating at such a high level that it began a standard throughout Hungary. In the 1977/78 school year, on the recommendation of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences' Pedagogic <b>Research</b> <b>Section,</b> Varga was chosen by UNESCO's Institute for Education as the location of ongoing educational research under the leadership of Dr. Ottó Mihály and Dr. József Bernáth. The research was focused on the concept of lifelong learning, {{which is one of the}} key educational principles of the European Union. At the same time, between 1971 and 1981, Varga was also used as a testing ground for the early Matura exams. Subjects such as orientation, family studies and others were taught experimentally. One of the more successful projects was the so-called studium generale subject, which included library studies, learning methodology, psychology (self-awareness, creativity), logic, rhetoric, and debate.|$|E

He spent 1932 in the United States, having been awarded a Rockefeller Foundation scholarship, then returned to Manchester University where he became Robert Ottley Reader in Statistics from 1933 to 1939 and set up an Economic <b>Research</b> <b>Section</b> carrying out applied research. While at Manchester he published research on the distribution of national capital using estate duty data and a book on public and private property. In 1939, Mr Campion joined the Central Economic Intelligence Service (CEIS), part of the War Cabinet Office, whose purpose was to provide economic and statistical material for a continuous survey of financial and economic plans and where Campion's role was to organise the statistics needed.|$|E

500|$|Between 1940 and 1941, Alexander {{held the}} rank of Captain in the Naval Intelligence Service, working on radio {{direction-finding}} at Singapore Naval Base. She became Senior Physicist and Head of the Operational <b>Research</b> <b>Section</b> of the Radio Development Laboratory in Wellington, New Zealand in 1942, where she remained until 1945. There she was responsible for most radio and radar research, including pioneering of radio meteorology in conjunction with Washington State College, development of the microwave radar program, and research on anomalous propagation leading to the post-war international project, Project Canterbury. In 1945, Alexander identified the [...] "Norfolk Island Effect" [...] as solar radiation, confirming that solar interference increased with sunbursts.

500|$|Analysis by Operational <b>Research</b> <b>Section</b> Number 2 (ORS2) {{concluded}} that {{the bombing of the}} first aiming point north-west of Caen was accurate, finding that the centre of the 90 percent zone (the area where 90 percent of the bombs fell) was [...] east of the aiming point, with some spillage to the south and west. Examination of the area after its capture, indicated some destruction of German equipment, including the wreckage of ten of the forty trucks believed to be in the area {{at the time of the}} raid. The 48 hours that elapsed between the bombing and the Allied occupation of the area, allowed the Germans time to recover from any shock and disorientation and to salvage some damaged equipment. Examination of the second aiming point, [...] "Northern Caen", failed to reveal a 90 percent zone but it was noted that the obstructive effect of bombing a suburb was significant and had caused substantial delays to vehicles of both sides, by cratering and blocking roads. ORS2 {{concluded that}} the success of Charnwood owed little to the bombing and made recommendations including changing to instantly fused bombs, dropping larger numbers of smaller anti-personnel bombs and rapidly following-up a bombardment with ground forces to take advantage of its main effect, which was the temporary suppression of German will to resist. In Operation Goodwood, Operation Bluecoat, Operation Cobra, Operation Totalize and Operation Tractable the 21st Army Group exploited better the effect of preparatory attacks by strategic bombers by following-up the attacks immediately.|$|E
