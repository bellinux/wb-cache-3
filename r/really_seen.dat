5|$|The {{episode is}} {{read in a}} radically {{different}} way by Walter Goffart. According to him, the whole story assumes an allegorical meaning, with Paul intent on telling an edifying story of {{the downfall of the}} hero and his expulsion from the promised land, because of his human weakness. In this story, the skull cup plays a key role as it unites original sin and barbarism. Goffart does not exclude the possibility that Paul had <b>really</b> <b>seen</b> the skull, but believes that by the 740s the connection between sin and barbarism as exemplified by the skull cup had already been established.|$|E

500|$|Mark {{returned}} during [...] "Episode 6646", {{which focused}} on an eclipse. Kate was left questioning whether she had <b>really</b> <b>seen</b> him. Brewer said that her character would be torn when Mark returns, as she had moved on with Mason Turner (Taylor Glockner) and Mark's reappearance [...] "just throws it all out of whack". When asked whether Kate and Mark's reunion would be bittersweet, McGregor explained [...] "Brennan and Kate definitely have chemistry and their parting was not because they {{had fallen out of}} love. But things are different now and Kate has a new boyfriend. When Brennan tells her he still loves her it's hard because she thought he was dead and had let go of him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} re-issued on December 25, 2002 for IMAX and large-format theaters. Don Hahn {{explained}} that {{eight years after}} The Lion King got its original release, [...] "there was {{a whole new generation}} of kids who haven't <b>really</b> <b>seen</b> it, particularly on the big screen." [...] Given the film had already been digitally archived during production, the restoration process was easier, while also providing many scenes with enhancements that covered up original deficiencies. An enhanced sound mix was also provided to, as Hahn explained, [...] "make the audience feel like they're {{in the middle of the}} movie." [...] On its first weekend, The Lion King made $2.7 million from 66 locations, a $27,664 per theater average. This run ended with $15,686,215 on May 30, 2003.|$|E

500|$|The men's {{road race}} began at 11:00 local time (UTC+8) and within [...] of the start, Horacio Gallardo (Bolivia) and Patricio Almonacid (Chile) formed a two-man breakaway. They held a maximum {{advantage}} of 15 minutes, but were never <b>really</b> <b>seen</b> as a threat, {{and in fact}} neither went on to finish the race. With no single team willing to force the pace, a 26-man breakaway formed at the [...] mark, including Carlos Sastre (Spain), Kim Kirchen (Luxembourg), Jens Voigt (Germany), Roman Kreuziger (Czech Republic) and Simon Gerrans (Australia). Shortly after the race reached the finish line to begin the first of seven [...] loops, Gallardo was dropped by Almonacid. The lone Chilean leader was then caught by the now 24-man chase group at the summit on the second loop, after riding solo ahead of the pack {{for over an hour}} and a half.|$|E
500|$|Cody {{stated that}} when writing the script, she was [...] "simultaneously {{trying to pay}} tribute to some of the {{conventions}} that we've already seen in horror, yet, at the same time, kind of turn them on their ear". One of her influences from the 1980s horror genre was the film The Lost Boys. She wanted to [...] "honor that, and at the same time, [...] had never <b>really</b> <b>seen</b> this particular subgenre done with girls and [...] tried to do a little of both". Despite this, she said she had noticed that [...] "the last survivor standing in the typical horror film is a woman" [...] and that because of this she feels [...] "horror has always had kind of a feminist angle to it in a weird way and, at the same time, it's kind of delightfully exploitative". Jennifer's Body could play on both of these aspects.|$|E

He played the trombone in the marching band {{and was a}} member of the math, biology, coin, and German clubs but was regarded as an outsider by his classmates. In 1996, a former classmate said: [...] "He was never <b>really</b> <b>seen</b> as a person, as an individual personality... He was always regarded as a walking brain, so to speak." [...] During this period, Kaczynski became intensely interested in mathematics, spending hours studying and solving advanced problems. He became associated with a group of likeminded boys interested in science and mathematics, known as the [...] "briefcase boys" [...] for their penchant for carrying briefcases. One member of this group recalled Kaczynski as [...] "the smartest kid in the class... just quiet and shy until you got to know him. Once he knew you, he could talk and talk." ...|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't know if I would be making movies or working in a restaurant, I {{had no idea what}} I would be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never <b>really</b> <b>seen</b> anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three nights in a row because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E
500|$|Durand {{was never}} {{informed}} of his character's arc and only learned more of Keamy's {{importance to the}} plot as he received new scripts; thus, he was thrilled when the role was expanded for his third appearance, in [...] "The Shape of Things to Come", when he kills Alex and Durand compared his excitement to that of [...] "a kid in a candy store." [...] He also stated that [...] "you really don't know what's {{going to happen in}} the next episode and you get the scripts pretty late, so it is pretty secretive and it's kind of exciting that way [...] you're really forced to get in the moment and say the words and play the guy". [...] Durand was initially met with negative reaction from fans on the street for this action and he defended his murderous character by arguing that it was actually more Ben's fault for failing to negotiate with Keamy; later, fans warmed up to Keamy. [...] Despite the antagonist's increasing popularity and fanbase, it became apparent to Durand that fans were hoping for Keamy's death in what promised to be a showdown in the season finale. [...] Throughout his nine-episode run, Keamy never receives an episode in which his backstory is developed through flashbacks and Durand holds this partially responsible for the negative reaction to his character, saying that the audience [...] " [...] <b>really</b> <b>seen</b> anything outside of Keamy's mission, so I think they definitely want him put down." [...] Following the season's conclusion, Durand stated that he would not be surprised if his character returned in the fifth season and concluding that [...] "Lost was really fun.

500|$|In 1992, {{the band}} {{embarked}} {{on its first}} ever European tour. On March 13, 1992, at the Munich, Germany show at Nachtwerk, Pearl Jam played Ten in its entirety in order midway through its set. The band would only do this again in 2016 at Philadelphia's Wells Fargo Center, as the arena management homaged the band's tenth straight sellout concert in the city. Following the European leg, Pearl Jam did another tour of North America. Goldstone noted that the band's audience expanded, saying that unlike before, [...] "everyone came." [...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening {{and there was no}} stopping it. To play in the Midwest and be selling out these 500 seat clubs. Eddie could say he wanted to talk to Brett, the sound guy, and they'd carry him out there on their hands. You hadn't <b>really</b> <b>seen</b> that reaction from a crowd before..." [...] When Pearl Jam came back for a second go-around in Europe the band appeared at the Pinkpop Festival and the Roskilde Festival in June 1992. The band cancelled its remaining European dates in the summer of 1992 after the Roskilde Festival due to a confrontation with security at that event as well as exhaustion from touring. Ament said, [...] "We'd been on the road over 10 months. I think there just came a point about half way through that tour it was just starting to get pretty intense. I mean just being away from home, being on the road all the time and being lonely or being depressed or whatever." [...] The band would go on to play the 1992 Lollapalooza tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Soundgarden, Ministry and Ice Cube, among others.|$|E
500|$|Stump and Wentz met up for {{the first}} time in several years in early 2012 for a writing session. Wentz reached out to Stump after he penned his letter, as he too felt he was in a dark place and needed a {{creative}} outlet. He was at first reluctant to approach Stump, likening the phone call to reconnecting with a lover after years of acrimony. [...] "I know what you need – you need your band," [...] Wentz told Stump. [...] "I think it's kind of weird that we haven't <b>really</b> <b>seen</b> each other this year. We paid for each other's houses and you don't know my kid," [...] Wentz remarked. The result, [...] "three or four" [...] new songs, were shelved with near immediacy, with the two concluding that [...] "it just wasn't right and didn't feel right." [...] Several months later, the two reconvened and wrote tracks that they felt truly represented the band in a modern form. The band decided that if a comeback was in order, it must represent the band in its current form: [...] "We didn't want to come back just to bask in the glory days and, like, and collect a few checks and pretend ... and do our best 2003 impersonation," [...] said Stump. Afterwards, the quartet held an all-day secret meeting at their manager's home in New York City where they discussed ideas and the mechanics of getting together to record. Trohman was the last to be contacted, through a three-hour phone call from Stump. As Trohman was arguably the most excited to begin other projects, he had a list of stipulations for rejoining the band. [...] "If I'm not coming back to this band writing music [...] then I don't want to," [...] he remarked. Stump supported Trohman's ambition saying Trohman [...] "needed to be writing more." ...|$|E
500|$|Verne Gay of Newsday {{described}} it as [...] "another fine, fine Lost". [...] The San Diego Union-Tribunes Karla Peterson gave the episode an [...] "A", calling it [...] "one of those dense, chewy episodes in {{which a lot of}} stuff happened to a lot of people, and the foundation was laid for one hell of a season finale." [...] She praised Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Jorge Garcia, Elizabeth Mitchell and Jeremy Davies's work in [...] "Something Nice Back Home", while Tom Iacuzio of The Daytona Beach News-Journal deemed Jeremy Davies's performance deserving of an Emmy Award. [...] The Palm Beach Posts Kevin Thompson [...] "thought [...] Matthew [...] did a nice job conveying a wide range of emotions—scared, haunted, frustration, horny, jealousy, just to name a few." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] "was partly a transitional passage in the Lost saga, a busywork episode designed to put all the characters in position for the year's big finale" [...] and [...] " [...] appendicitis [...] the kind of hardcore castaway survival plotline we haven't <b>really</b> <b>seen</b> since season 1. [...] Combined with a strong character-driven flash story, it was very old school Lost." [...] Jensen also [...] "liked how the episode neatly neutralized one of [...] least favorite season 4 moments, the Jack-Juliet smooch". [...] TV Guides Michael Ausiello wrote that [...] "Fox quietly solidified his status as one of the tube's most reliable and unshowy stalwarts" [...] and deemed him deserving of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination. [...] Oscar Dahl of BuddyTV gave the episode a positive review, saying that he was [...] "shocked and baffled" [...] and writing that [...] "Lost … can give me an exciting, well-done episode while making me fear where the series is going … [...] ghosts aren't my thing." [...] The Huffington Posts Jay Glatfelter decided that [...] "what made this episode great was the fact that it just contained so much story [...] Jack's flashforward [...] this one of his most interesting 'centric' episodes. … Not only was Jack's story interesting for a change, but the inclusion of [...] other characters … and giving them great story and character development [...]" [...] Daniel of TMZ graded [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] as a [...] "B".
