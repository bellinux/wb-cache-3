If, until recently, they were considered to be non-productive activities, in the presentservices’ activities contribute substantially to the actualization of GDP. In present we cannottalk about economic activities without taking in account transport activities, either we thinkabout supply, or we have in sight the capitalization of producing material goods. Concomitantly it is necessary to have in view both, the transport of individuals and thetransport of goods. Beside their economic role transports also have a social function due to thesatisfaction of individuals’ possibilities regarding their movement. The evolution of Romaniantransport within the East European transport presents a desk research, and it offers an imageabout transport development in the East of Europe. Within the accomplished analysis therewill be distinguished the following: rail transport of passengers, goods’ transport by rail,goods’ transport by <b>road,</b> <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> of goods, air transport of passengers and the airtransport of goods in different East European countries, emphasizing the evolution anddevelopment of transport in Romania compared to the evolution and development of transportfrom other countries...|$|E

40|$|Increased {{environmental}} concerns due to carbon emission and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) call upon a shift towards environmentally friendly modes of transport {{in oil and}} gas industry. Modal shift from <b>road</b> to <b>sea</b> has of late been highly encouraged in many policy documents, due to low carbon emissions in the latter than {{is the case in}} the former. However the challenge remains on the implementation of the strategic move towards green logistics. This paper proposes a framework which offshore oil and gas companies can adopt in moving from <b>road</b> to <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> citing Statoil as a case study. Furthermore it explores and discuses methods in which Statoil could obtain a solution to environmentally friendly mode of transport as well as suggests the type of supply vessel that is cost-efficient and environmentally friendly. Modal shift will necessitate the use of third party logistics service providers. This will in turn influence transaction costs due to external market involvement. This paper posits that at the high level of environmental uncertainty when there is little / no trust between exchange partners, there is a high risk of ex-post opportunistic behaviour. On the contrary, opportunistic behaviour dampens with the high level of trust between exchange partners, thus reducing the transaction costs...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the European Union political agenda, {{particularly with respect to}} the role ports that will play in the next decade, emphasise the need for a total re-assessment of the policies pursued by the relevant authorities. A variety of fairly rapid changes, coupled with important technological improvements, have increased the level of competition impacting on port activities. This, combined with a general policy shift from <b>road</b> to <b>sea</b> <b>transport,</b> has highlighted various factors, including the role of the ‘passenger’, in the maritime industry. This role has been somewhat neglected, or at least undervalued, for many years. The main aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the quality dimensions of ports in terms of the provision of services to passengers, as well as to identify and analyse the different groups (passenger profiles), which use the port and its services for coastal shipping. This is important in order to identify future competitive advantages for passenger ports. Evidence from the Greek coastal shipping industry reveals a multidimensionality in passenger perceptions of port-service quality and identifies two groups of users of port services.

Rigid link, established between power unit and cargo space, is dominant in maritime and <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> (<b>sea</b> ships and trucks), and occasionally in transport on inland waterways (self – propelled barges). Flexible link is used in the railroad transport (systems with trailers and semi trailers), and in inland waterway transport (push – towing and pulling systems, and combinations of the systems).

40|$|In CTS Working Paper 2011 : 14 it {{is shown}} that the balance between <b>road,</b> rail and <b>sea</b> <b>transports</b> for long {{distance}} freight transports in, to and from Sweden in 2015 / 16 would shift in favour of road transports. The result follows the prediction that the <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> costs increase slightly less than rail transport costs if the government gives all modes an equal liability for external costs and applies the same funding model for all modes. The current report analyses based on a literature review and interviews with shippers how the changed transport costs would influence mode choice. It is {{shown that the}} companies are price sensitive, independently of the mode of transport. The transport costs (per tonkm) for sea and rail are low when economies of scale are realised. But there is a trade-off between low transport costs and high frequencies. Transport chains that make use of economies of scale for <b>sea</b> and rail <b>transports</b> often contrast to “small scale chains” that go via the nearest port. The role of the forwarders is crucial {{when it comes to}} transport solutions that affect several shippers as consolidation of goods volumes or usage of unbalanced flows. Preferences to change to other modes differ between different sectors and between inbound and outbound transports etc. The overall picture is that shippers and forwarders’ preference to use <b>sea</b> <b>transports</b> instead of land transports is limited. The existence of economies of scale {{in different parts of the}} transport system and the shippers’ demand of many departures can be seen as hinder for small scale <b>sea</b> <b>transports</b> through the many ports on the Swedish coastline...|$|R

40|$|Freight demand {{elasticity}} studies vary {{significantly in}} terms of the demand measure, data type, estimation method, commodity type, etc. This wide variation makes it difficult to compare empirical estimates when the differences may arise in part from the methods and data used. In this paper we conduct a comparative analysis to identify systematic sources of influence on direct price elasticity estimates in the context of freight transport, distinguishing between <b>road,</b> rail, and <b>sea</b> <b>transport,</b> using published direct price elasticities from 12 elasticity-derivative studies from five countries. The study focuses on revealed preference elasticities defined by the freight rate for tonnes and tonne kilometres of inter-city freight movements. Systematic sources that explain differences in direct price elasticities include the demand elasticity measure, mode, commodity class, model estimation form, country, and temporal nature of data (e. g., cross-section). Analysts can utilise the model outputs to adjust the empirical evidence from specific studies to control for differences that impact on the behavioural implications of comparative evidence.

Il caso Autostrade del mare", presentato dall'Autore al convegno "Il mare, risorsa prioritaria del Corridoio Adriatico". The {{article is}} a summary of a report {{presented}} during the seminar "Il mare risorsa prioritaria del Corridoio Adriatico" (The sea as the primary resource of the Adriatic Corridor), organised in November 2001 by the Pesaro and Urbino Chamber of Commerce. The transport of lorries by Ro-Ro ships across the Italian seas (also known as "Sea Highways") is a widely- discussed topic in Italy. Indeed, many stakeholders believe {{that the use of}} sea ways is a truly useful way of lifting the burden of traffic off the highways. The article emphasises the need to evaluate the real potential of Ro-Ros in cutting the highway traffic in the Italian regions facing the Adriatic, and separating Italian domestic transport from the international one. Further, the article includes other observations that emerged during the debate on the "Sea Highways": it advises against the drawing up the "sea highways " strategy {{on the basis of the}} comparison between transit times in <b>road</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>transport,</b> and stresses the need to concentrate the Ro-Ro infrastructures in few ports. The article concludes with considerations on the need to impose, in international traffic (towards Greece and Turkey), rigid roles for each Adriatic port, in order to avoid the Italian roads being used by foreign lorries. The latter, when crossing over from Central Europe and the Mediterranean countries, prefer to use - for economy's sake - the ports in Southern Italy instead of those placed in the North, thus increasing instead of cutting down road traffic...|$|R

40|$|In Sweden and Europe the {{interest}} {{for sustainable development}} is constantly growing.

The EU-commission believes {{that the amount of}} freight <b>transported</b> on <b>sea</b> or rail have to increase if the transport sector is to achieve the European climate goals. The {{purpose of this study was}} to find suitable actions to decrease the environmental load of bulky gods and in this case prefabricated house modules was studied. Two scenarios were compared; <b>road</b> <b>transport</b> and <b>sea</b> <b>transport.</b> A model for comparison inspired of PAS 2050 was established and the study had a bottom-up fuel-based perspective. The data collection was based mainly on the involved companies historical fuel consumption data for specific vehicle types. The fuel consumption for ships was estimated by a ship-owner. The time required for sub processes was estimated from each specific company and based on fuel consumption data the total fuel required was calculated. The fuel was converted to emissions based on emission factors for Swedish circumstances from the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency. The EPS method, developed by the Centre for Environmental Assessment of Products and Material Systems of Chalmers university of technology was used to weight the emissions. Global Warming Potentials (GWP) was calculated to achieve comparability and strengthen the reliability of the study. The study shown that in this case <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> would have an environmental load 230 % higher than road transport. Sensitivity analyses show that by changing ship fuel to a more refined type would decrease the ships environmental load by 45 %. The other parameters analyzed show that in decreasing order had a large contribution to the results; Ship capacity, ship fuel consumption, ship load factor. The calculated GWP showed similar results as general GWP/tonne-km data for trucks and ships after a load factor adjustment. The load factor adjustment only compensated for the load factors assumed in the general data and the actual load factors in this study. In the case of this study it is recommended to use road transport due to the low environmental load compared to <b>sea</b> <b>transport.</b> If <b>sea</b> <b>transport</b> is to be used it is recommended that the ship use the most environmental friendly fuel, such as the Swedish type “Eo 1 ” classed fuel.
