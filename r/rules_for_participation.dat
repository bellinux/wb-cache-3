30|$|As Dougherty (2016) details, cycling {{through the}} abductive {{learning}} routines for institutional problem setting and solving begins with imagining a configuration of interdependencies among relational elements and rules {{that can produce}} the specific kind of collaboration needed to address a certain problem.

Evaluating digs into the hypothesized interdependencies to examine assumptions {{and figure out what}} works and not, and why and how.

40|$|Parliamentary {{approval}} can be {{of crucial}} importance to ensure the democratic legitimacy of military operations as it can establish public consent to the executive's use of force. But involving parliament in decisions to deploy military forces may have negative repercussions on the efficiency of operations, e. g. by slowing down decision-making. As the military activity of democracies {{has been on the}} rise {{since the end of the}} Cold War, democracies around the world have been increasingly pressed to deal with this trade-off between legitimacy and efficiency in sending troops abroad. This paper surveys the deployment provisions of 49 contemporary democracies to establish whether and how parliaments are actually involved in deployment decisions. It demonstrates that the <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> parliamentary <b>participation</b> mark a continuum that ranges from complete exclusion to a comprehensive veto position of parliament over all potential deployments. In between these two extremes, democracies have found a wide variety of solutions to cope with the legitimacy-efficiency problem. Despite the growing prevalence of military deployments, there is no discernible trend towards parliamentarisation, however. Rather the trend towards internationalisation of security policies contributed to a weakening of parliamentary powers in some countries. © 2010 The Author...|$|R

5000|$|In one of {{her most}} heavily cited works, The Silenced Dialogue, Delpit argues the focus on {{process-oriented}} as opposed to skills-oriented writing instruction reduces the chances for black children {{to gain access to the}} tools required for accessing the [...] "culture of power", which she describes as follows: (1) Issues of power as being enacted in classrooms; (2) Codes or <b>rules</b> established <b>for</b> <b>participation</b> in power, lending credence to the existence of a [...] "culture of power"; (3) Rules of the culture of power being a reflection of the rules adhered to in the culture of those who have power; (4) Understanding explicitly the rules of a culture of power as fundamental to acquisition of the power of that culture; and (5)Tendency of those within the culture of power to be least aware or willing to admit that a culture of power exists. Delpit explores stances taken by teachers towards black children within the classroom and emphasizes how essential it is for teachers, both black and white, to communicate effectively and positively with black students if they are to achieve academic success. She concludes the skills/process debate is fallacious because it subscribes to the view that black and poor children can be categorically organized. Rather, she asserts the need for equipping black students to communicate across cultures. She believes teachers can play a major role as they give a voice to people and to children of color.|$|R
40|$|This report {{evaluates the}} Climate Change Initiative as {{presented}} by President Bush on February 14, 2002. The President's proposal aims {{to reduce the}} greenhouse gas intensity of the US economy by 18 per cent between 2002 and 2012. This policy target {{can be regarded as}} being very modest, when compared to historical trends and projected baseline developments. It will not prevent US emissions from rising and in fact, the proposal implies that US greenhouse gas emissions in 2012 will be 32 per cent above the 1990 -level. This is far above the original Kyoto target for the US of - 7 per cent in 2010, or - 3 per cent corrected for sinks. The US effort is also significantly less than the efforts of the EU, Japan and Canada under the Kyoto Protocol. Yet, there are concerns that even the modest US target will not be met in case of economic slowdown and because of its voluntary character and lack of a compliance regime or clear <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> corporate <b>participation.</b> Furthermore, the Bush Initiative advocates using intensity targets in the international climate change regime for the steps to be taken after Kyoto but overlooks serious problems associated with this approach. The main problem is the inherent uncertainty about the environmental effectiveness. Furthermore, it is very likely to lead to delays in reducing global emissions, making the EU target of stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations below a doubling of pre-industrial levels no longer feasible. It can be concluded that the Bush Initiative offers no credible alternative to the Kyoto Protocol as a basis for establishing an effective and acceptable regime. At the same time, the President's proposal is mainly of political significance as it explicitly accepts the importance of the climate change problem and the long-term objective of the Climate Change Convention. Thereby, the Bush Initiative improves the longer term prospects <b>for</b> US <b>participation</b> in a global climate change regime...|$|R

Golubenko's family claims that the decision of the Federation contradicts FIDE's General <b>Rules</b> <b>for</b> <b>participation</b> in FIDE events. Estonia's leading grandmaster Jaan Ehlvest agrees with this opinion. Still the Estonian Chess Federation has not allowed Golubenko to play under the Estonian flag despite open letters to FIDE written by both Golubenko's parents, because of the requirement of citizenship set in the Sport Act. As a solution, the Estonian Chess Federation proposed Golubenko to apply for Estonian citizenship; this proposal was rejected by the Golubenko's family. [...] As Golubenko was denied to play for Estonia and her strength was not enough for Russia she decided to play under the flag of Croatia, which was allowed by FIDE.|$|E

40|$|Fruit and {{vegetable}} sectors are principally seen as sectors where small producers {{are able to}} participate due to their low demand on land and their high labor requirements. However, the concern exists that small producers participation in the international fruit {{and vegetable}} trade could be diminishing {{as a result of}} the increasing prevalence of food quality standards in the sector. Standards define the terms of chain membership, imply <b>rules</b> and conditions <b>for</b> <b>participation,</b> and hence lead to processes of (re) distribution within the chain (Gibbon and Ponte, 2005). For some producers, standards may open up new opportunities as they permit market access to particular market segments. At the same time, the process of (re) distributing market shares is accompanied by marginalization and exclusion, as standards may impose prohibitively high barriers for certain producers in terms of the short-term and long-term efforts needed for production under certification. This is particularly relevant since certification with private standards has become a major requirement <b>for</b> <b>participation</b> in fruit and vegetable markets worldwide. One of the most important private standards for fruit and vegetables is the EUREPGAP standard, which has now become quasi-mandatory for several export destinations (USAID, 2005). This paper aims to analyze two particular questions with regard to the distributional effects of standards: 1) which producers comply, and which do not; and 2) why do some producers comply while others do not? With respect to the first question, various surveys have mentioned the particular difficulties facing small producers within this new trading environment (e. g. Humphrey et al. 2004; Kleinwechter and Grethe 2006; Maertens and Swinnen 2006; World Bank 2005). However, most of these surveys have hypothesized that small producers are disadvantaged within the new trading environment on theoretical grounds without actually providing empirical evidence for this assertion.

40|$|School autonomy” {{began in}} Nicaragua in 1993 as a {{voluntary}} program, maintained through ministerial directive. In 2002, the newly passed New Law of Education Program extended ‘school autonomy’ to all {{public schools in}} the country. Essentially, the New Law introduces a new set of principles and <b>rules</b> <b>for</b> parental <b>participation,</b> local accountability, and local coordination in Nicaraguan schools. However, new rules and principles are nothing more than instructions that can be ignored- in fact, in Nicaragua, they often are. In this study, we problematize the one-to-one relationship between rules and behaviour that has been the cornerstone of contemporary change theorizing in the developing world. In contrast to the ‘change as rule-based’ perspective, we argue that a more effective approach is to study an actor’s motivation to follow the new rules. In this study, we suggest that an actor’s motivation to follow the rules is conditioned by their expectations about how others will behave in relation to those rules (behavioural beliefs). This attention to the relationship between rules, institutions, and behavioural beliefs represents a new way of studying change in the context of underdevelopment. We employ Avner Greif’s Historical Comparative Institutional Analysis (HCIA) to study school change in Nicaragua in order to demonstrate how stakeholders’ normative beliefs and behavioural beliefs condition their motivations towards the change initiative. By examining the evolution of these ‘normative beliefs and expectations’, we show how historical norms encapsulated in the country’s institutions, shape stakeholder responses to new initiatives, such as school autonomy. Our study reveals how change requires all aspects of the educational institution (its formal rules and organizations) to come together to perpetuate the new normative understandings associated with the new rules. However, in Nicaragua, our findings reveal that despite the introduction of new <b>rules</b> and principles <b>for</b> education, the organizations of education in Nicaragua have continued to perpetuate historical, normative understandings that are opposed to the norms of ‘school autonomy’ and the principles of good governance. Thus, the prospects and possibilities of change under the ‘school autonomy’ reform have been limited...|$|R
