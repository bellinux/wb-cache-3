The inequality indicators we calculated (the Gini index, the <b>relative</b> <b>mean</b> <b>deviation,</b> the coeficient of variation, the standard deviation of logarithms, the Mehran index and the Piesch index) show an increase in inequality determined by the flat tax. The Lorenz curve is illustrative, as only the last quantile of the population (richest 20 %) appears as the clear winner of the flat tax. The results also indicate that the higher the income level, the higher the income elasticity of consumption.

Most importantly, taxes are more effective in redistributing income in urban than in rural areas, while welfare and other government transfer programs play a relatively larger role in rural area. Effect of Government Policies on Urban and Rural Income Inequality Although income inequality has increased substantially in both urban and rural areas of the United States over the past two decades, the levels of inequality in these areas have evolved differently. We investigate whether these alternate paths are due to different responses to changes in taxes, minimum wage laws, social insurance policies, and transfer programs.

40|$|The bipolar mean {{has been}} {{recently}} proposed {{with the aim}} of summarizing the ordinal variables (Walter Maffenini and Michele Zenga, 2005) [1]. It is a synthetic distribution where the total size n is concentrated on one of the k categories of the variable or, at most, on two consecutive categories. This measure is derived according to the usual statistical dominance criterion that is based on the retro-cumulative frequencies. Further improvements of the bipolar mean include extensions to discrete quantitative variables and a new variability measure, i. e. the mean deviation about the bipolar mean. The bipolar mean can be applied also to ordinal variables whose categories are expressed as scores on a numerical scale. Hence, the new way to summarize these variables can be useful in sensory analysis, where it is often necessary to compare frequency distributions representing the evaluations on some characteristics about different products made by judges or tasters. The assessment is usually based on simple synthetic measures such as the arithmetic mean or the median, but these indexes can provide contradictory answers. In this work we propose the normalization of the mean deviation of the bipolar mean.

The measures that are commonly applied can be misleading because such measures obscure the difficulty in obtaining a complete ranking of distributions. The nature of the social welfare function underlying these measures is important. The overall object is to demonstrate that varying implications for the welfare of society result from inequality measures. Method Various tools for measuring a distribution are applied to some illustrative data on four distributions about mental health services. Although these data refer to this one aspect of health, the exercise is of broader relevance than mental health. The summary measures of dispersion conventionally used in empirical work are applied to the data here, such as the standard deviation, the coefficient of variation, the <b>relative</b> <b>mean</b> <b>deviation</b> and the Gini coefficient. Other, less commonly used measures also are applied, such as Theil's Index of Entropy, Atkinson's Measure (using two differing assumptions about the inequality aversion parameter).

40|$|The {{decomposition}} of inequality measures according to within-group and between-group contributions has been addressed {{up to now}} (a) to identifying measures which satisfy in a natural way such decomposition, being characterized by special regularity assumptions, and (b) to the preliminary determination of the between-group inequality as the most primitive one, letting the within-group term as residual with respect to total inequality. Both approaches reveal some drawbacks in the use and interpretation of inequality measures. Therefore an alternative approach is proposed, which is applicable—as well as (b) —to every inequality measure we start from a distribution reflecting only the within-group inequality, so that the corresponding measure Iw can be computed, leaving the between group term IB as a residual {{with respect to the}} total inequality I. &# 13; This procedure assumes that the groups are composed by the same number m of aggregate units, or by some replicas of the same distribution of aggregate units; on this basis an "average percentile distribution" is defined as a distribution averaged over all groups, clearly responsible for the within-group inequality; actually the Lorenz curve of this distribution appears as a weighted mean of the group Lorenz curves.

That way, six trees aged at least 11 years were used. Cross-sections with 5 cm thickness were collected at heights of 0. 10 meters, 0. 70 meters, 1. 30 meters and so on at every 1 meter along the bole. True height growth for a given age was measured on the section itself by dividing it in two parts along the pith and looking for the exact point where the true annual height growth took place. The accuracy analyses were based on residuals between true heights and those estimated by the tested methods for each age. For this analysis, the <b>relative</b> <b>mean</b> <b>deviation</b> (D %), relative mean absolute deviation (AbsD %), standard deviation of differences (S d) and sum of squared relative residuals (SSRR) were calculated. These 4 statistics evaluated together, allowed for the identification of the most accurate method for every age. Complementarily, the non paired t 0. 05 test for data was applied to evaluate whether the residuals from each method were significant or not. The results of the analysis indicated that Carmean (1972) and Lenhart (1972) were identical owing {{to the fact that they}} estimated the same height value for sections where there was only one growth ring finishing in the same section. This situation occurred for most of the results in this current study.

40|$|The {{desorption}} isotherms of miscanthus, Miscanthus x giganteus (stems and leaves) were determined separately {{by using the}} saturated salt solutions method at three temperatures (25, 50 and 70 degrees C) within a range from 5 to 90 % relative humidity. Experimental curves of {{desorption isotherms}} were fitted to Modified Henderson, Modified Halsey, Modified Oswin and Modified Chung-Pfost models and evaluated by Residual Sum of Squares (RSS), Standard Error Estimation (SEE) and <b>Mean</b> <b>Relative</b> <b>Deviation</b> (MAD) methods. The Modified Oswin model {{was found to be}} the most suitable for describing the correlation between equilibrium moisture content, relative humidity and temperature...|$|R
40|$|An interlaboratory {{comparison}} {{was performed to}} evaluate the analytical methods for quantification of anhydrosugars â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 levoglucosan, mannosan, galactosan â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 and biosugars â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 arabitol, glucose and mannitol â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 in atmospheric aerosol. The performance of 10 laboratories in Italy currently involved in such analyses was investigated on twenty-six PM (particulate matter) ambient filters, three synthetic PM filters and three aqueous standard solutions. An acceptable interlaboratory variability was found, determined as the <b>mean</b> <b>relative</b> standard <b>deviation</b> (RSD...|$|R
