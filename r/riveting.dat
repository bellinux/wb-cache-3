5|$|The lead boat of the class, U-10, {{was built}} by Germaniawerft of Kiel, while the other four were {{constructed}} by AG Weser of Bremen. All five were transported by rail in sections to Pola, where they only needed <b>riveting</b> together to be complete, a process that typically took about two weeks.|$|E
5|$|The skins of the fuselage, {{wings and}} {{tailplane}} were secured by rivets, and in critical {{areas such as}} the wing forward of the main spar where an uninterrupted airflow was required, with flush rivets; the fuselage used standard dome-headed <b>riveting.</b> From February 1943 flush <b>riveting</b> was used on the fuselage, affecting all Spitfire variants. In some areas, such as {{at the rear of the}} wing, and the lower tailplane skins, the top was riveted and the bottom fixed by brass screws which tapped into strips of spruce bolted to the lower ribs. The removable wing tips were made up of duralumin-skinned spruce formers. At first the ailerons, elevators and rudder were fabric-covered. When combat experience showed that fabric-covered ailerons were impossible to use at high speeds, a light alloy replaced the fabric, enhancing control throughout the speed range.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Dumbo in October 1941, the U.S. entered World WarII. Disney formed the Walt Disney Training Films Unit within the company to produce {{instruction}} films for the military such as Four Methods of Flush <b>Riveting</b> and Aircraft Production Methods. Disney also met with Henry Morgenthau, Jr., the Secretary of the Treasury, and agreed to produce short Donald Duck cartoons to promote war bonds. Disney also produced several propaganda productions, including shorts such as Der Fuehrer's Facewhich won an Academy Awardand the 1943 feature film Victory Through Air Power.|$|E
30|$|After {{preprocessing}} {{the images}} {{obtained by the}} image acquisition equipment, a high-quality <b>rivet</b> image is obtained. In order to complete the measurement of the <b>rivets,</b> <b>rivets</b> must be recognized from the obtained images. Then, the exact coordinate set of <b>rivet</b> contour is obtained by region contour tracking, which lays a good foundation for <b>rivet</b> measurement in the next step. In this chapter, the acquisition process of <b>rivet</b> contour coordinate set is described in detail, which {{is divided into three}} parts: <b>rivet</b> image segmentation, <b>rivet</b> image analysis, and <b>rivet</b> image contour tracking.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Many {{methods can}} be used to {{assemble}} large mechanical structures. Using <b>rivets</b> is one of these methods. <b>Rivets</b> are lighter than bolts and allows for efficient assembly. The cylindrical structure has a discontinuous <b>rivet</b> assembled region. So concentration load operates in the edge of discontinuous assembled region. This paper evaluates the force placed upon <b>rivets</b> used to assemble cylindrical structures and strength of structures assembled with <b>rivets.</b> Plastic deformation of <b>rivets</b> occurs at 4 kN and <b>rivets</b> are destroyed at 7 kN. However, <b>rivets</b> are designed to transfer load to neighboring <b>rivets</b> when they are overloaded. Structural test were accomplished using tension and bending load condition. The structural tests showed that plastic deformation first occurs in the fastening where the <b>rivet</b> meets the outside of the cylinder and a number of <b>rivets</b> exhibited this type of deformation. The secondary phase of deformation occurs in the fastening where the <b>rivet</b> meets the inside of the cylinder. Despite the plastic deformation, the structural tests showed that the <b>rivets</b> succeeded in redistributing load to neighboring <b>rivets</b> and as a result, no <b>rivets</b> were destroyed...|$|R
50|$|A <b>rivet</b> gun, {{also known}} as a {{pneumatic}} hammer, is a type of tool used to drive <b>rivets.</b> The <b>rivet</b> gun is used on the manufactured head side of the <b>rivet</b> and a bucking bar is used on the buck-tail side of the <b>rivet.</b> The energy from the hammer in the <b>rivet</b> gun drives the work and the <b>rivet</b> against the inertia of the bucking bar. As a result, the tail of the <b>rivet</b> is deformed and work-hardened. At the same time the work is tightly drawn together and retained between the <b>rivet</b> head and the broadened and flattened tail. Nearly all <b>rivet</b> guns are pneumatically powered. Those <b>rivet</b> guns used to drive <b>rivets</b> in structural steel are quite large while those used in aircraft assembly are easily held in one hand. A <b>rivet</b> gun differs from an air hammer in the precision of the driving force.|$|R
5|$|Dor makes {{a strong}} feminist {{statement}} without being strident or shouting slogans. And all along, the <b>riveting</b> friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and the events that bring them together, keep tugging at your heart. Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away. Her journey from joyous subjugation — where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws — to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
5|$|Hood {{was laid}} down at Chatham Dockyard on 12 August 1889 and was {{launched}} on 30 July 1891, the Viscountess Hood christening her. She finished her sea trials in May 1893 and was commissioned on 1 June 1893 {{at the cost}} of £926,396. Her assignment to the Mediterranean Fleet was delayed when she sprang a leak in her forward compartments on 7 June as a result of faulty <b>riveting</b> and excessive strain on the hull when she had been docked. Repairs took only two days, and the ship left Sheerness for the Mediterranean on 18 June.|$|E
5|$|The main {{contractor}} was Hamilston's Windsor Ironworks Company Limited of Garston, Liverpool. They were tasked with the founding and erection {{of the pier}} cylinders on the riverbed, and the erection and <b>riveting</b> of the twenty-one bowstring spans and the swing bridge over the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal. They were also responsible for another swing bridge on the North Docks Branch of the line close to the New Docks at Sharpness. The company manufactured the castings and the wrought iron structures for the bridge. Project manager George Earle was later given a watch praising his ability and enthusiasm for carrying out the project. The engineers for the project were George Wells Owen and George William Keeling.|$|E
50|$|Solid <b>rivets</b> {{are one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{reliable}} types of fasteners, having been found in archaeological findings dating back to the Bronze Age. Solid <b>rivets</b> consist simply of a shaft and head that are deformed with a hammer or <b>rivet</b> gun. A <b>rivet</b> compression or crimping tool can also deform this type of <b>rivet.</b> This tool is mainly used on <b>rivets</b> close to the edge of the fastened material, since the tool is limited by the depth of its frame. A <b>rivet</b> compression tool does not require two people, and is generally the most foolproof way to install solid <b>rivets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At {{a central}} {{location}} near the areas being <b>riveted,</b> a furnace was set up. <b>Rivets</b> {{were placed in}} the furnace and heated to glowing hot (often to white hot) so that they were more plastic and easily deformed. The <b>rivet</b> warmer or [...] "cook" [...] used tongs to remove individual <b>rivets</b> and throw them to a catcher stationed near the joints to be <b>riveted.</b> The catcher (usually) caught the <b>rivet</b> in a leather or wooden bucket with an ash-lined bottom. He placed the <b>rivet</b> into the hole to be <b>riveted,</b> then quickly turned to catch the next <b>rivet.</b> The [...] "holder up or holder on" [...] would hold a heavy <b>rivet</b> set or dolly or another (larger) pneumatic jack against the round head of the <b>rivet,</b> while the riveter (sometimes two riveters) applied a hammer or pneumatic <b>rivet</b> hammer to the unformed head, making it mushroom tightly against the joint in its final domed shape. Alternatively the buck is hammered more or less flush with the structure in a counter sunk hole. Before the use of pneumatic hammers, e.g. in the construction of RMS Titanic, the man who hammered the <b>rivet</b> was known as the [...] "basher". Upon cooling, the <b>rivet</b> contracted and exerted further force, tightening the joint.|$|R
30|$|The {{standard}} 2 D <b>rivet</b> {{image is}} an axisymmetric figure. In {{the case of}} horizontal placement of the <b>rivets,</b> {{the length of the}} external rectangle is the full length of the <b>rivets,</b> and the environment of the industrial automation production site is very complex, which may result in the <b>rivets</b> being slanted. Therefore, this paper uses the method of finding the minimum external rectangle of <b>rivets</b> to locate the spindle. This method can directly obtain the full length of <b>rivets,</b> and it can solve the influence of <b>rivet</b> orientation on the detection process.|$|R
5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc spot welding, thereby replacing <b>riveting</b> or resistance spot welding. It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E
5|$|The ships' hulls were {{constructed}} with transverse steel frames; over 90percent of the hulls used welding {{instead of the}} then standard <b>riveting,</b> which saved 15 percent of their total hull weight. This savings allowed the armament and armor to be increased. The hulls contained twelve watertight compartments and were fitted with a double bottom that extended for 92percent {{of the length of}} the keel. As designed, the ship's complement comprised 33officers and 586enlisted men. After 1935, the crew was dramatically increased, to 30 officers and 921–1,040 sailors. While serving as a squadron flagship, an additional 17 officers and 85 enlisted men augmented the crew. The second flagship had an additional 13 officers and 59 sailors. The ships carried a number of smaller boats, including two picket boats, two barges, one launch, one pinnace, and two dinghies.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} productively, {{throughout the}} 1914–18 the company continually invested in new facilities and tools. In 1915 it introduced pneumatic <b>riveting</b> which need only one riveter whereas previously two had been required.|$|E

50|$|A {{version of}} the Oscar <b>rivet</b> is the Olympic <b>rivet</b> which uses an {{aluminum}} mandrel that is drawn into the <b>rivet</b> head. After installation, the head and mandrel are shaved off flush resulting in an appearance closely resembling a brazier head driven <b>rivet.</b> They are used in repair of Airstream trailers to replicate {{the look of the}} original <b>rivets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Rivet</b> diameters are {{commonly}} measured in -inch increments and their lengths in -inch increments, expressed as [...] "dash numbers" [...] {{at the end}} of the <b>rivet</b> identification number. A [...] "dash 3 dash 4" [...] (XXXXXX-3-4) designation indicates a -inch diameter and -inch (or -inch) length. Some <b>rivets</b> lengths are also available in half sizes, and have a dash number such as -3.5 ( [...] inch) to indicate they are half-size. The letters and digits in a <b>rivet's</b> identification number that precede its dash numbers indicate the specification under which the <b>rivet</b> was manufactured and the head style. On many <b>rivets,</b> a size in 32nds may be stamped on the <b>rivet</b> head. Other makings on the <b>rivet</b> head, such as small raised or depressed dimples or small raised bars indicate the <b>rivet's</b> alloy.|$|R

25|$|Other {{structural}} changes included flush <b>riveting</b> for the fuselage, introduced in mid-1943. A streamlined round rear-view mirror, with a bullet-shaped fairing replaced the rectangular version. On new production Mk IXs the small, teardrop shaped identification light behind the radio mast was removed.|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of machine-countersunk flush <b>rivets</b> for aircraft described in reference 1 revealed {{the necessity of}} having {{the height of the}} <b>rivet</b> heads greater than the depth of the countersunk holes if tightly <b>riveted</b> joints were to be obtained. If ordinary roundhead <b>rivets</b> were inserted from {{the opposite side of the}} joint and the countersunk heads formed in the driving of the <b>rivets</b> filled the countersunk holes completely, still tighter joints were obtained. In either case the <b>rivets</b> protruded above the skin surface after driving, and the protruding portion of the <b>rivet</b> heads had to be removed in order to obtain flush <b>rivets.</b> A number of requests have been received for a description of the tool used to mill off the protruding portion of the <b>rivet</b> heads. This report contains assembly and detail drawings of the latest flush-rivet milling tool used at the NACA Structures Research Laboratory. Figure 6 shows the tool in operation. This tool is quite satisfactory for 1 / 8 -inch <b>rivets,</b> but a more powerful motor is recommended for use with larger <b>rivets...</b>|$|R
5000|$|While {{structural}} blind <b>rivets</b> using {{a locked}} mandrel are common, {{there are also}} aircraft applications using [...] "non-structural" [...] blind <b>rivets</b> where the reduced, but still predictable, strength of the <b>rivet</b> without the mandrel is used as the design strength. A method popularized by Chris Heintz of Zenith Aircraft uses a common flat-head (countersunk) <b>rivet</b> which is drawn into a specially machined nosepiece that forms it into a round head <b>rivet,</b> taking up much of the variation inherent in hole size found in amateur aircraft construction. Aircraft designed with these <b>rivets</b> use <b>rivet</b> strength figures measured with the mandrel removed.|$|R
40|$|The steel {{thin-walled}} {{structures are}} widespread in civil and industrial engineering nowadays. Self-drilling screws or <b>rivets</b> {{are used to}} interconnect thin-walled elements. Blind <b>rivets</b> and nuts as connectors are considered in the frames of this paper. <b>Rivets</b> have some benefits over self-drilling screws. They are: we can obtain more dense connection when using <b>rivets.</b> So we can increase bearing capacity of connection; a lower cost of <b>riveted</b> connection; a large variety of installation tools for <b>riveted</b> connection: manual, pneumatic, battery; side; an easy installation: access to the connected element is required only from one. These benefits provide increasingly growling popularity to <b>rivets.</b> In the paper 4 types of <b>rivets</b> are considered: combined (aluminum/steel) blind <b>rivets,</b> zinc-coated steel blind <b>rivets,</b> stainless steel blind <b>rivets</b> and blind nuts. The features of each type of <b>rivets</b> are described in the paper. The influence on the behaviour of connections is revealed. The results of experimental research performed by the authors are presented in the paper. A bearing capacity shear of <b>riveted</b> connections is studied in the experiment. There are 3 types of <b>riveted</b> connections subjected to experiment: connection made by blind combined rivets; connection made by zinc-coated steel blind rivets; connection made by blind nuts. A connection between elements with significantly different thicknesses is modeled in the experiment. In reality this situation takes place, for example, in the roofing of buildings, where trapezoidal sheet can be fastened to purlin by <b>rivets.</b> As {{a result of the}} experiment the authors found out that the local deformations occuring under <b>rivet</b> head in the thick element significantly affect the behaviour and bearing capacity of the connection. That’s why the results of connection's bearing capacity obtained in tests were lower than the bearing capacity of <b>rivet</b> declared by manufacturers...|$|R

25|$|<b>Riveting</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} ancient {{metalwork}} joining processes. Its use has declined markedly during the second half of the 20th century, but it still retains important uses in industry and construction, and in artisan crafts such as jewellery, medieval armouring and Metal Couture into the 21st century.

40|$|<b>Riveted</b> lap joints {{are being}} used {{traditionally}} for long in the aerospace industry. These joints are the crucial zones that are designed under damage tolerance procedures in the civil aircraft industry. Conventional design procedures of <b>riveted</b> lap joints {{are based on the}} assumption that all <b>rivets</b> carry equal load. As this assumption is not entirely valid as found in research literature associated with fatigue and fracture, it is important to investigate this point in terms of the static strength of the <b>riveted</b> joint as well. Hence, in the present study, <b>riveted</b> joint’s static strength experiments and numerical studies are carried out on four different (single and multi-row) <b>riveted</b> lap joints with strain gauges placed at specified locations. The experiments show that all the <b>riveted</b> lap joints sustained the estimated ultimate load and failed only after reaching or exceeding the joint failure load. All these <b>riveted</b> lap joints are analyzed by non-linear finite element method, considering the <b>rivet</b> yielding, plate yielding, geometrical nonlinear and secondary bending effects of the lap joint. The analysis of <b>riveted</b> lap joints shows that though there is unequal load distribution among the <b>rivets</b> in the elastic regime, once the <b>rivets</b> start yielding, significant redistribution of the load takes place among the <b>rivets</b> and the load sharing between the <b>rivets</b> is nearly equal at the failure load of the joint. The agreement between the finite element analysis strains and experimental strains is reasonably good at the failure load and this in conjunction with the aforementioned experimental finding proves that the <b>rivets</b> share nearly equal load at the joint failure load and justifies the conventional design methodology of <b>riveted</b> joints. To the authors’ knowledge no previous research evidence for such correlation was found and this paper confirms conventional design procedures are adequate, though complex interactions between the plate and <b>rivets</b> tend to exist based on non-linear behavior. ...|$|R
