As he {{carefully}} chose those <b>rings</b> <b>set</b> with sparkling stones, such as rubies, amethysts and sapphires, the Scarecrow's hands now presented a most brilliant appearance.|$|E
60|$|At length they halted {{within a}} fair-sized chamber. There were <b>rings</b> <b>set</b> {{in the rocky}} walls. To them chains were fastened, and {{at the ends of}} many of the chains were human skeletons. One of these they kicked aside, and, {{unlocking}} the huge padlock that had held a chain about what had once been a human ankle, they snapped the iron band about my own leg. Then they left me, taking the light with them.|$|E

50|$|The {{cryptanalyst}} {{now knew}} the plugboard, the rotor order, and the absolute {{setting of the}} rotors for the doubled key, {{but he did not}} know the <b>ring</b> <b>setting.</b> He also knew what the message key setting should be, but that setting was useless without knowing the <b>ring</b> <b>setting.</b> The <b>ring</b> <b>setting</b> could be anything, and that meant the Poles did know how to position the rotors for the message body. All the work up to this point had focussed on exploiting the doubled key. To determine the <b>ring</b> <b>setting,</b> the attention now shifted to the actual message.|$|R

60|$|The high priestess, thought Tarzan. She was a {{young woman}} with a rather {{intelligent}} and shapely face. Her ornaments were similar to those worn by her votaries, but much more elaborate, many being set with diamonds. Her bare arms and legs were almost concealed by the massive, bejeweled ornaments which covered them, while her single leopard skin was supported by a close-fitting girdle of golden <b>rings</b> <b>set</b> in strange designs with innumerable small diamonds. In the girdle she carried a long, jeweled knife, and in her hand a slender wand in lieu of a bludgeon.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was an odd}} sort of incongruity in Levi's dress; a pair {{of heavy}} gold {{earrings}} and a dirty red handkerchief knotted loosely around his neck, beneath an open collar, displaying to its full length the lean, sinewy throat with its bony [...] "Adam's apple," [...] gave to his costume somewhat the smack of a sailor. He wore a coat {{that had once been}} of fine plum color--now stained and faded--too small for his lean length, and furbished with tarnished lace. Dirty cambric cuffs hung at his wrists and on his fingers were half a dozen and more <b>rings,</b> <b>set</b> with stones that shone, and glistened, and twinkled {{in the light of the}} fire. The hair at either temple was twisted into a Spanish curl, plastered flat to the cheek, and a plaited queue hung halfway down his back.|$|E
60|$|Jan {{held his}} tongue, {{as if he}} had no {{objection}} to be pacified to please a friend, and they gradually reached the foot of the ladder, Poorgrass being flattened like a jumping-jack, and the sixpence, for admission, which he had got ready half-an-hour earlier, having become so reeking hot in the tight squeeze of his excited hand that the woman in spangles, brazen <b>rings</b> <b>set</b> with glass diamonds, and with chalked face and shoulders, who took the money of him, hastily dropped it again from a fear that some trick had been played to burn her fingers. So they all entered, and the cloth of the tent, to the eyes of an observer on the outside, became bulged into innumerable pimples such as we observe on a sack of potatoes, caused by the various human heads, backs, and elbows at high pressure within.|$|E
50|$|The model above {{ignored the}} right rotor's <b>ring</b> <b>setting</b> (22) and ground setting (12), {{both of which}} were known because Rejewski had the daily keys. The <b>ring</b> <b>setting</b> has the effect of counterrotating the drum by 21; the ground setting {{advances}} it by 11. Consequently, the rotor rotation is -10, which is also 16.|$|R

60|$|His name is as an {{ointment}} poured forth; 'Tis sweet {{from east}} to west, from south to north. He's white and ruddy; yea of all the chief; His golden head is rich beyond belief. His eyes are like the doves which waters wet, Well wash'd with milk, and also fitly set, His cheeks as beds of spices, and sweet flowers. He us'd to water with those crystal showers, Which often flowed from his cloudy eyes; Better by far than what comes from the skies. His lips like lilies, drop sweet-smelling myrrh, Scenting as do those of the comforter. His hands are as gold <b>rings</b> <b>set</b> with the beryls; By them we are delivered out of perils; His legs like marble, stand in boots of gold, His countenance is ex'lent to behold. His mouth, it is of all a mouth most sweet, O kiss me then, Lord, every time we meet! Thy sugar'd lips, Lord, let them sweeten mine, With the most blessed scent of things divine.|$|E
60|$|Bright as {{the scene}} was; fresh, {{and full of}} motion; airy, free, and sparkling; it was nothing to the life and exultation in the breasts of the two travellers, at sight of the old churches, roofs, and darkened chimney stacks of Home. The distant roar that swelled up hoarsely from the busy streets, was music in their ears; the lines of people gazing from the wharves, were friends held dear; the canopy of smoke that {{overhung}} the town was brighter and more beautiful to them than if the richest silks of Persia had been waving in the air. And though the water going on its glistening track, turned, ever and again, aside to dance and sparkle round great ships, and heave them up; and leaped from off the blades of oars, a shower of diving diamonds; and wantoned with the idle boats, and swiftly passed, in many a sportive chase, through obdurate old iron <b>rings,</b> <b>set</b> deep into the stone-work of the quays; not even it was half so buoyant, and so restless, as their fluttering hearts, when yearning to set foot, once more, on native ground.|$|E
6000|$|... § XI. And so in all {{the other}} palaces built at the time, consummate {{strength}} was joined with a lightness of form and sparingness of material which rendered it eminently desirable that the eye should be convinced, by every possible expedient, of {{the stability of the}} building; and these twisted pillars at the angles are not among the least important means adopted for this purpose, for they seem to bind the walls together as a cable binds a chest. In the Ducal Palace, where they are carried up the angle of an unbroken wall forty feet high, they are divided into portions, gradually diminishing in length towards the top, by circular bands or <b>rings,</b> <b>set</b> with the nail-head or dog-tooth ornament, vigorously projecting, and giving the column nearly the aspect of the stalk of a reed; its diminishing proportions being exactly arranged as they are by Nature in all jointed plants. At the top of the palace, like the wheat-stalk branching into the ear of corn, it expands into a small niche with a pointed canopy, which joins with the fantastic parapet in at once relieving, and yet making more notable by its contrast, the weight of massy wall below. The arrangement is seen in the woodcut, Chap. VIII.; the angle shafts being slightly exaggerated in thickness, together with their joints, as otherwise they would hardly have been intelligible on so small a scale.|$|E

60|$|Men of {{substance}} sported superfine Saxony with the broadest of silk-velvet collars; but the fit suggested second-hand finery. Other elongated cocoa-nuts bore jauntily a black felt of 'pork-pie' order, leek-green billycocks, and anything gaudy, but not neat, in the 'tile'-line. Their bright azure ribbons and rainbow neckties and scarves vied in splendour with the loudest of thunder-and-lightning waistcoats {{from the land}} of Moses and Sons. Pants were worn tight, to show the grand thickness of knee, the delicate leanness of calf, the manly purchase of heel, and the waving line of beauty which here distinguishes shin-bones. There were monstrous studs upon a glorious expanse of 'biled' shirt; a small investment of cheap, tawdry <b>rings</b> <b>set</b> off the chimpanzee-like fingers; and, often enough, gloves invested the hands, whose horny, reticulated skin reminded me of the black fowl, or the scaly feet of African cranes pacing at ease over the burning sands. Each dandy had his badine upon whose nice conduct he prided himself; the toothpick was as omnipresent as the crutch, nor was the 'quizzing-glass' quite absent. Lower extremities, of the same category as the hands, but slightly superior in point of proportional size, were crammed into patent-leather boots, the latter looking {{as if they had been}} stuffed with some inanimate substance--say the halves of a calf's head. Why cannot these men adopt some modification of the Chinese costume, felt hat and white shoes, drawers, and upper raiment half-shirt, half-doublet? It has more common sense than any other in the world.|$|E
60|$|For {{several weeks}} they cruised among the islands {{bartering}} goods with the natives of sea-coast villages. At {{most of these}} the captain had touched on previous voyages, {{and as soon as}} the ship was recognized the canoes came off freely. Stephen gradually got rid of the goods he had purchased at Calcutta. Knowing nothing of the respective value of the bird skins, he was guided simply by their rarity. Of skins of which numbers were brought on board, he bought none, however brilliant the plumage; but whenever he saw one that was new to him he at once made an offer for it. But as this was seldom, his box filled but slowly, until one day he went ashore with the captain, the first mate, and twelve sailors armed to the teeth, to pay a visit to the chief. On the few occasions on which he had landed he always carried with him a hand-bag filled full of trade goods. On the present occasion, after the feasting had gone on for some time, he stole out from the chief’s hut. The men were sitting down in front drinking palm wine, but keeping a vigilant eye upon the movements of the natives. Presently one of the Malays came up to him and touched his bag, as if to ask what were its contents. He brought out two or three small looking-glasses, some large brass necklaces, and a few of the cheap bangles and <b>rings</b> <b>set</b> with coloured glass, used by the Hindoo peasant women. The native pointed to a hut near, and beckoned to Steve to follow him.|$|E

50|$|In Nuremberg, Germany, between 1531 and 1572, {{apprentices}} {{who wished}} to become master goldsmith were required to produce columbine cups, dice for a steel seal, and gold <b>rings</b> <b>set</b> with precious stones before they could be admitted to the goldsmiths' guild. If they failed to be admitted, then they could continue to work for other goldsmiths but not as a master themselves. In some guilds, apprentices {{were not allowed to}} marry until they had obtained full membership.|$|E
