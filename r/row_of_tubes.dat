50|$|To {{cool down}} the engine, a coolant is {{passed through the}} engine block, where it absorbs heat from the engine. The hot coolant is then fed into the inlet tank of the {{radiator}} (located either {{on the top of}} the radiator, or along one side), from which it is distributed across the radiator core through tubes to another tank on the opposite end of the radiator. As the coolant passes through the radiator tubes on its way to the opposite tank, it transfers much of its heat to the tubes which, in turn, transfer the heat to the fins that are lodged between each <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes.</b> The fins then release the heat to the ambient air. Fins are used to greatly increase the contact surface of the tubes to the air, thus increasing the exchange efficiency. The cooled coolant is fed back to the engine, and the cycle repeats. Normally, the radiator does not reduce the temperature of the coolant back to ambient air temperature, but it is still sufficiently cooled to keep the engine from overheating.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{behaviour}} of turbulent flows past a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> {{of equal}} diameter and regularly spaced was experimentally studied in a wind tunnel assembly using hot wire anemometry and a pressure transducer. Flows past a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> are observed in many engineering fields, like energy and process industies and oil prospecting. In heat exchangers, the undisturbed incident flow is {{set by the}} first <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes,</b> generating the flow structures that travel through the bank until the fully turbulence dominates. Traditional Fourier analysis and the more recent wavelet analysis were used to characterize the flow phenomena. This paper presents the characterization of the flow just next a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> of pitch to diameter ratio of 1. 26, considered in the literature as a transition geometry where the behaviour of the flow can be unstable...|$|E

Out of roughly 5, 000 mutant samples screened using phototaxis, twelve samples were phototaxis-negative and only four of the twelve samples were phototaxis-negative the second trial.

40|$|AbstractA {{coupling}} method between multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann {{method and}} finite volume method {{is used to}} simulate the 2 D fouling process on a single <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes.</b> The particle motion is simulated by the cellular automata model. The fluid flow and particle deposition process around the tubes is simulated by multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann method, while the downstream fluid flow is simulated by finite volume method to save the computational time. The restitution coefficient calculated by the energy balance and the critical impact angle are used as the criterions for particle deposition. The deposition processes for 5 μm, 10 μm particles with inlet velocity 5 m/s and 10 m/s are simulated with the method. The {{results show that the}} particle with small diameter and inlet velocity tends to deposit more rapidly. The vortices behind the tubes bring the particles back to the leeward side of the tube, and a concave shape of fouling continues growing on the entire leeward half of the tube. A cone shape fouling layer forms on the windward side of the tube. The cone shape changes the air flow and stops the deposition on the windward side.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an investigation on the effects of wavy cylindrical tubes in a staggered heat exchanger tube bundle. Experimental measurements and large eddy simulation (LES) technique were used to study the turbulent flow characteristics in a staggered tube bundle arrangement at a sub-critical Reynolds number of Re = 7500. The aim of this investigation is to compare the flow characteristics of a new configuration of cylindrical tubes with that of a similar arrangement which comprises purely circular cylinders. The first row of circular tubes is replaced by a row of wavy cylindrical tubes. The result of the experiment shows that the mean velocity distributions and turbulence intensity, obtained by the present LES method, are in good agreement with the Laser Doppler Anemometer (LDA) measurements. The wake patterns around the second row of cylinders become more well organized upon the introduction of wavy cylinders of optimal wavelength (λ/Dm = 6). The turbulent kinetic energy behind the first <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> is also reduced. The power density spectra of the vortex shedding in the tube bundle are evidently suppressed. As a result, the fluctuating forces of the tube bundles are weakened. However, the drag is not noticeably reduced by such modification. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the use of air cooled {{condensers}} in thermoelectric units, such as steam power plants or combined cycle units. The paper describes the main features of air cooled condensers, showing the problems related to their use, such as the presence of non-condensable gases inside the steam flow or the condenser performances variability due to ambient conditions. The present study refers to A-frame air cooled condensers characterized by single-pass and multiple-row arrangement. A phenomenological study has been done in order to calculate the main physical parameters which describe the condenser operating conditions. In particular, three mathematical models have been developed: while both the first and the second model consider a condenser with tubes characterized by the same finned surface, with or without the use of throttling valves upstream of each tube, the third model examines the behaviour of a condenser with different row effectiveness. The three mathematical models permit also to investigate the possible vapour back flow inside each <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes,</b> by calculating the axial coordinate value along each tube at which the condensing steam mass flow rate becomes null; the third mathematical model has been implemented in the Matlab/Simulink environment in order to couple the simulator of the condenser with the whole plant simulation model...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{circumferential}} overlap trisection helical baffle shell-and-tube {{heat exchanger}} (cothSTHX) is a modification {{one based on}} the quadrant helical baffle one to improve the heat transfer performance. The model of cothSTHX has 34 tubes and 3 rods with tube layout of equilateral triangle and a baffle inclined angle of 20 °, and the numerical simulation of flow and thermal performances was conducted using the commercial CFD software FLUENT. The distributions of temperature, pressure and velocity, and temperature, pressure or velocity nephograms with superimposed velocity vectors for special slices can provide access to important implicit information in the simulation results. The Dean vortex secondary flow, {{which is one of}} the key mechanisms of enhancing heat transfer in heat exchangers, is clearly depicted, and it shows that the fluid in spiral channel flows outward under the centrifugal force, then flows back to the axis under radial differential pressure, thus a single vortex is formed in each baffle pitch cycle. The unfolded concentric hexagonal slices are designed to make up for the defect that the shortcut leakage flow in the V-notch zone of the adjacent baffles could not be depicted along the longitudinal slices. Moreover, the shortcut leakage flow is restricted with the damper effect of the structure that a <b>row</b> <b>of</b> <b>tubes</b> in the circumferential overlap area of adjacent baffles...|$|E
