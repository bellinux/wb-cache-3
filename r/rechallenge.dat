5|$|Roguelike-likes are {{generally}} much shorter games {{intended to be}} winnable within a single gaming session, in contrast to traditional roguelikes that are designed for multiple sessions of gameplay. Associated with their short length, many roguelike-likes feature a metagame, whereby achieving certain goals will unlock features {{such as the ability}} to select a new character {{at the start of the}} game or the addition of new items and monsters in the procedural generation of the game's levels. Several roguelike-likes feature daily challenges, in which a preset random seed is used to generate the game's levels in a deterministic fashion so that each player will have the same encounters; players attempt to complete the game through those levels or otherwise get the highest score through online leaderboards. Roguelike-likes may also allow the player to enter the random seed directly as to be able to <b>rechallenge</b> the same set of levels or share a difficult set of levels with other players.|$|E
5000|$|Dechallenge and <b>rechallenge</b> {{refer to}} a drug being stopped and {{restarted}} in a patient, respectively. A positive dechallenge has occurred, for example, when an adverse event abates or resolves completely following the drug's discontinuation.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the mechanisms whereby a previous attack of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) modifies a subsequent {{attack in the}} Lewis rat. Active immunization with myelin basic protein (MBP) and complete Freund 2 ̆ 7 s adjuvant 28 days after the passive transfer of MBP-sensitized spleen cells induced a second episode of EAE, which occurred earlier than in naive control animals, but was less severe overall. The pattern of neurological signs was also different in <b>rechallenged</b> rats, which had less severe tail and hindlimb weakness but more severe forelimb weakness. In <b>rechallenged</b> rats, inflammation was more severe in the cervical spinal cord, cerebellum, brainstem and cerebrum, but less severe in the lumbar spinal cord, than in controls. The early onset of EAE in <b>rechallenged</b> rats was explained by a memory T cell response to MBP 72 - 89 in the draining lymph node and spleen, and by the enhanced entry of T cells into {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). However, the number of alpha beta T cells in the spinal cord of <b>rechallenged</b> rats declined faster than in controls, especially in the lumbosacral cord, where the number of V beta 8. 2 + T cells and the frequency of T cells reactive to MBP 72 - 89 rapidly decreased, indicating rapid downregulation of the immune response in the previously inflamed spinal cord. Apoptosis of inflammatory cells in the CNS was increased in the <b>rechallenged</b> rats and is likely to contribute to this downregulation. Furthermore, during the disease course the generation of encephalitogenic T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs was limited compared with controls. Thus, a previous attack of EAE modifies a subsequent attack through the interaction of the following processes: a memory T cell response to MBP; facilitated T cell entry into the CNS; downregulation of the immune response in the CNS, including increased apoptosis of inflammatory cells; and a limited generation of encephalitogenic T cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the third of}} three vaccination trials of Panamanian Aotus monkeys with a recombinant blood-stage antigen derived from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Immunization was performed with an N-terminal region of the SERA antigen (serine repeat antigen protein), SERA 1, that contains a 262 -amino-acid fragment including amino acids 24 to 285 of the 989 -amino-acid SERA protein. Vaccinations were carried out with the recombinant protein mixed with either Freund's, MF 75. 2, or MF 59. 2 adjuvant. A control group that did not receive SERA 1 but only MF 75. 2 adjuvant was included. Monkeys vaccinated with the antigen MF 59. 2 mixture produced low anti-SERA 1 titers and were not protected. Monkeys vaccinated with antigen and Freund's adjuvant had, in general, a higher average anti-SERA 1 titer (107, 278) than did monkeys immunized with SERA 1 and MF 75. 2 (40, 143), yet monkeys in both groups were well protected. Monkeys that received only MF 75. 2 developed neither detectable anti-SERA 1 nor anti-P. falciparum antibodies prior to or 10 days after parasite challenge, yet were apparently protected against infection. Monkeys vaccinated with either SERA 1 and Freund's, SERA 1 and MF 75. 2, or MF 75. 2 alone and that had been challenged but did not develop a countable parasitemia were treated with a curative dose of mefloquine 100 days after parasite challenge and then <b>rechallenged</b> 40 days later. None of the five <b>rechallenged</b> monkeys that had originally received SERA 1 and Freund's developed a countable parasitemia. Only one of five <b>rechallenged</b> monkeys that originally received SERA 1 and MF 75. 2 developed a high countable parasitemia, while two animals developed a barely countable parasitemia. Four of the <b>rechallenged</b> monkeys that had originally received only MF 75. 2 developed a moderate to high countable parasitemia. The results indicate that vaccination with SERA 1 and either Freund's or MF 75. 2 adjuvant provides protection and vaccination with MF 75. 2 alone can provide a temporary protection unrelated to the induction of anti-SERA 1 or antimalarial antibodies...|$|R

50|$|Subsequent {{authors have}} added the feature of Challenge/ Dechallenge/ <b>Rechallenge</b> for {{circumstances}} when the exposure is repeated {{over time and}} there is the ability to observe the associated outcome response, as might occur with an adverse reaction to a medication. Additional considerations when assessing an association are the potential impact of confounding and bias in the data, which can obscure a true relationship. Confounding refers to a situation in which an association between an exposure and outcome is all or partly the result of a factor that affects the outcome but is unaffected by the exposure. Bias refers to a form of error that may threaten the validity of a study by producing results that are systematically different from the true results. Two main categories of bias in epidemiologic studies are selection bias, which occurs when study subjects are selected as a result of another unmeasured variable that is associated with both the exposure and outcome of interest; and information bias, which is systematic error in the assessment of a variable. While useful when assessing a previously unexplored association, there is no combination or minimal number of these criteria that must be met in order to conclude that a plausible relationship exists between a known exposure and an observed outcome.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Objective: To {{determine}} {{the safety of}} lamotrigine <b>rechallenge</b> after a first episode of skin rash in bipolar patients. Method: An open cases prospective {{study was conducted with}} patients, who developed a skin rash when first treated with lamotrigine, were refractory to other treatments, and were offered lamotrigine <b>rechallenge</b> using a different dose titration. Additionally a review was performed on previous skin rash management strategies and lamotrigine <b>rechallenge</b> reports. Results: Every 3 out of 10 lamotrigine <b>rechallenge</b> patients required drug interruption due to persistent rash. One of them was potentially serious and resolved by stopping the lamotrigine. The review of available literature identified several lamotrigine <b>rechallenge</b> studies with rates of positive results varying between 70 % and 87 % depending on the study. No patient developed Stevens [...] -Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis after <b>rechallenge.</b> The rate of rash was higher when <b>rechallenge</b> began between 4 weeks from initial rash (19 % vs 7 %, P =. 001) and decreased when first rash showed no potentially serious signs (0 % vs 19 %, P =. 01). Conclusions: <b>Rechallenge</b> is a viable option after a benign lamotrigine-induced rash, and can even be rechallenged after rash with greater precautions when there exists one or two potentially serious signs. In cases of more serious rash there are no reliable data available on <b>rechallenge</b> safety and it may pose a significant risk.

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to The University of Arizona College of Medicine - Phoenix in partial {{fulfillment of the}} requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Medicine. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a life-threatening condition that can occur in patients who require long-term antipsychotic therapy, and who therefore must be rechallenged with antipsychotics after their NMS episode. Current guidelines are based on limited data and recommend that <b>rechallenge</b> be undertaken by titrating from low doses of low-potency antipsychotics, {{after a period of}} two weeks following resolution of symptoms. We present the case of a patient with an NMS course complicated by residual catatonia course and a literature review with analysis to determine whether time to <b>rechallenge,</b> potency of <b>rechallenge</b> drug, and dose of <b>rechallenge</b> drug are independent predictors of NMS recurrence in patients. One hundred thirteen instances of neuroleptic <b>rechallenge</b> in non-catatonic NMS cases and 29 cases of <b>rechallenge</b> in NMS with catatonic features were identified through broad Medline and PsycInfo database searches and were analyzed by a single reviewer for <b>rechallenge</b> data. Fifty-five cases involved female patients, and 87 male patients; patients ranged in age from 12 to 86, with a mean of 37. There was no statistically significant relationship found between rate of NMS recurrence and time elapsed before <b>rechallenge,</b> either for all cases or by subgroup. Although the recurrence rate for patients rechallenged with highest-potency antipsychotics was found to be higher than those rechallenged with lowest-potency drugs,the relationship was not significant. The maximum antipsychotic dose reached during <b>rechallenge</b> was significantly lower among patients with recurrence of NMS {{than those who did not}} recur, likely due to recurrences early in dose titration. There was no statistically significant relationship between starting dose and recurrence. Based on our analysis, time between resolution of symptoms and <b>rechallenge</b> may have no bearing on risk of recurrence, in contrast to current recommendations. Dose of <b>rechallenge</b> drug is also unlikely to be an independent predictor of recurrence.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} oxaliplatin-induced severe anaphylactic reactions (SAR) in metastatic {{colorectal cancer}} in a retrospective case series analysis and {{to conduct a}} systemic literature review. METHODS: During a 6 -year period from 2006 to 2011 at Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, a total of 412 patients exposed to oxaliplatin-related chemotherapy were retrospectively reviewed. Relevant English-language studies regarding life-threatening SAR following oxaliplatin were also reviewed in MEDLINE® and PubMed® search. RESULTS: Eight patients (1. 9 %, 8 of 412 cases) were identified. Seven patients were successful resuscitated without any sequelae and one patient expired. We changed the chemotherapy regimen in five patients and <b>rechallenged</b> oxaliplatin use in patient 3. Twenty-three relevant English-language studies with 66 patients were reported. Patients received a median of 10 cycles of oxaliplatin (range, 2 to 29). Most common symptoms were respiratory distress (60 %), fever (55 %), and hypotension (54 %).

Co-prescription of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor may prevent recurrent neutropenia and allow continuation or <b>rechallenge</b> of clozapine. Objective and methods: Systematic review of literature reporting the use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor to allow <b>rechallenge</b> or continuation of clozapine in people with previous episodes of clozapine-induced neutropenia. The efficacy of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and predictors of successful <b>rechallenge</b> will be determined to elucidate whether evidence-based recommendations can be made regarding the use of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor in this context. Results: A total of 17 articles were identified that reported on clozapine <b>rechallenge</b> with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor support. In all, 76 % of cases were able to continue clozapine at median follow-up of 12 [*]months. There were no clear clinical or laboratory predictors of successful rechallenge; however, initial neutropenia was more severe in successful cases compared to unsuccessful cases. Cases co-prescribed lithium had lower success rates of <b>rechallenge</b> (60 %) compared to those who were not prescribed lithium (81 %). The most commonly reported <b>rechallenge</b> strategy was use of filgrastim 150 – 480 [*]µg between daily to three times a week.
