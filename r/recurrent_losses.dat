40|$|AbstractMutation and {{subsequent}} recombination events create genetic diversity, which {{is subjected to}} natural selection. Bacterial mismatch repair (MMR) deficient mutants, exhibiting high mutation and homeologous recombination rates, are frequently found in natural populations. Therefore, we have explored the possibility that MMR deficiency emerging in nature has left some “imprint” in the sequence of bacterial genomes. Comparative molecular phylogeny of MMR genes from natural Escherichia coli isolates shows that, compared to housekeeping genes, individual functional MMR genes exhibit high sequence mosaicism derived from diverse phylogenetic lineages. This apparent horizontal gene transfer correlates with hyperrecombination phenotype of MMR-deficient mutators. The sequence mosaicism of MMR genes may be a hallmark of a mechanism of adaptive evolution that involves modulation of mutation and recombination rates by <b>recurrent</b> <b>losses</b> and reacquisitions of MMR gene functions...|$|E

DLBCL copy number aberrations have been identified previously, of which the deletion at 6 q 21 - 24 {{was significantly associated with}} a highly favorable clinical response to chemotherapy. In this study, we aimed to identify genes implicated in this and other genomic regions with <b>recurrent</b> <b>losses</b> and/or gains. To identify implicated genes, we superimposed array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data onto a microarray expression dataset of 42 clinically well-characterized primary nodal DLBCL biopsies. We confirmed that loss of 6 q 21 - 24 is significantly associated with a highly favorable clinical response to chemotherapy. Our approach identified 3 16 significant genes restricted to 32 chromosomal regions, including 24 genes identified at 6 q 21 - 24. In an independent dataset, 18 % of overexpressed genes in gained regions and 55 % of down-regulated genes in deleted regions were validated. In summary, using integrative genomics novel onco and tumor suppressor genes were identified in DLBCL that were not recognized by expression profiling alone. (c) 2008 Wiley-Liss, In...|$|E

In order to achieve a better delineation of such tumors, we performed an in-depth molecular characterization. Eighteen melanocytomas, 12 melanomas, and 14 melanotic and 14 conventional schwannomas (control group) were investigated for methylome patterns (450 k array), gene mutations associated with melanotic tumors and copy number variants (CNVs). The methylome fingerprints assigned tumors to entity-specific groups. Methylation groups also showed a substantial overlap with histology-based diagnosis suggesting that they represent true biological entities. On the molecular level, melanotic schwannomas were characterized by a complex karyotype with recurrent monosomy of chromosome 22 q and variable whole chromosomal gains and <b>recurrent</b> <b>losses</b> commonly involving chromosomes 1, 17 p and 21. Melanocytomas carried GNAQ/ 11 mutations and presented with CNV involving chromosomes 3 and 6. Melanomas were frequently mutated in the TERT promoter, harbored additional oncogene mutations and showed recurrent chromosomal losses involving chromosomes 9, 10 and 6 q, as well as gains of 22 q. Together, melanotic nervous system tumors have several distinct mutational and chromosomal alterations and can reliably be distinguished by methylome profiling...|$|E

Common established causes include uterine anomalies, antiphospholipid syndrome, hormonal and metabolic disorders, and cytogenetic abnormalities. Other etiologies have been proposed but are still considered controversial, such as chronic endometritis, inherited thrombophilias, luteal phase deficiency, and high sperm DNA fragmentation levels. Over the years, evidence-based treatments such as surgical correction of uterine anomalies or aspirin and heparin for antiphospholipid syndrome have improved the outcomes for couples with <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>loss.</b> However, {{almost half of the}} cases remain unexplained and are empirically treated using progesterone supplementation, anticoagulation, and/or immunomodulatory treatments. Regardless of the cause, the long-term prognosis of couples with <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>loss</b> is good, and most eventually achieve a healthy live birth. However, multiple pregnancy losses can have a significant psychological toll on affected couples, and many efforts are being made to improve treatments and decrease the time needed to achieve a successful pregnancy. This article reviews the established and controversial etiologies, and the recommended therapeutic strategies, with a special focus on unexplained <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>losses</b> and the empiric treatments used nowadays.

40|$|Desmoid tumours (also called deep or {{aggressive}} fibromatoses) are potentially life-threatening fibromatous lesions. Hereditary desmoid tumours arise in individuals affected by either {{familial adenomatous polyposis}} (FAP) or hereditary desmoid disease (HDD) carrying germline mutations in APC. Most sporadic desmoids carry somatic mutations in CTNNB 1. Previous studies identified losses on 5 q and 6 q, and gains on 8 q and 20 q as recurrent genetic changes in desmoids. However, virtually all genetic changes were derived from sporadic tumours. To investigate the somatic alterations in FAP-associated desmoids and to compare them with changes occurring in sporadic tumours, we analysed 17 FAP-associated and 38 sporadic desmoids by array comparative genomic hybridisation and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification. Overall, the desmoids displayed {{only a limited number}} of genetic changes, occurring in 44 % of cases. Recurrent gains at 8 q (7 %) and 20 q (5 %) were almost exclusively found in sporadic tumours. <b>Recurrent</b> <b>losses</b> were observed for a 700 kb region at 5 q 22. 2, comprising the APC gene (11 %), a 2 Mb region at 6 p 21. 2 -p 21. 1 (15 %), and a relatively large region at 6 q 15 -q 23. 3 (20 %).

However, these lesions are minute in size, making it a challenge to recover sufficient DNA from microdissected cells for comprehensive genomic analysis. As a step toward identifying genetic aberrations associated with oral cancer progression, we used tilingpath array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to compare alterations on chromosome 3 p for 71 OPLs against 23 oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). 3 p was chosen because, while it is frequently altered in oral cancers and has been associated with progression risk, its alteration status has only been evaluated at a small number of loci in OPLs. We identified six <b>recurrent</b> <b>losses</b> in this region that were shared between high-grade dysplasias (HGDs) and OSCCs, including a 2. 89 Mbp deletion spanning the FHIT gene (previously implicated in oral cancer progression). When the alteration status for these six regions was examined in 24 low-grade dysplasias (LGDs) with known progression outcome, we observed that they occurred at a significantly higher frequency in LGDs that later progressed to later stage disease (p < 0. 003).

40|$|PhDFollicular {{lymphoma}} (FL) is {{the second}} most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and at least a third of cases undergo aggressive transformation (t-FL), most frequently to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This study examined the role of germline and acquired genetic changes in FL and t-FL to determine prognostically significant events and chart the evolution of transformation. Assessment of germline polymorphic variation in over 200 FL cases demonstrated two SNPs in the HLA region of chromosome 6 p (rs 10484561 and rs 6457327) associate with FL risk in the UK and identified that rs 6457327 predicts both time to and risk of transformation independently of clinical variables, including the FLIPI. Mutation and expression studies of the single known gene in linkage disequilibrium with rs 6457327 (C 6 orf 15) suggest an alternative mechanism is responsible for this transformation association. DNA copy number and mutational analysis of FL and t-FL samples then revealed a high prevalence of TNFSRF 14 and EZH 2 mutations at transformation accompanied by frequent loss and gain of their genomic locations on chromosome 1 p and 7 q, respectively. In a search for co-operating genetic events, genome-wide profiling identified <b>recurrent</b> <b>losses</b> and gains ranging from 4 kb to 60 Mb with gain 2 p 16. 1 -p 15 (including REL) predictive of worse survival in FL that transforms.

40|$|Human {{germ cell}} tumors (GCTs) of {{neonates}} and infants comprise a heterogeneous group of neoplasms, including teratomas and yolk sac tumors with distinct clinical and epidemiologic features. As yet, {{little is known}} about the cytogenetic constitution of these tumors. We applied the recently developed genomewide array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) technology to 24 GCTs derived from patients under the age of 5 years. In addition, we included seven tumors derived from children and adolescents older than 5 years. In the series from those under the age of 5 years, most teratomas displayed normal profiles, except for some minor recurrent aberrations. In contrast, the yolk sac tumors displayed <b>recurrent</b> <b>losses</b> of 1 p 35 -pter and gains of 3 p 21 -pter and of 20 q 13. In the GCTs of patients older than 5 years, the main recurrent anomalies included gains of 12 p and of whole chromosomes 7 and 8. In addition, gains of the 1 q 32 -qter region and losses of the 6 q 24 -qter and 18 q 21 -qter regions were frequent in GCTs of varied histology, independent of age. We concluded that array CGH is a highly suitable method for identifying recurrent chromosomal anomalies in GCTs of neonates and infants.

We conducted a case-control study of 93 patients with <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>loss</b> (cases) and 206 healthy multiparous women (controls) in a Colombian subpopulation. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers of the inherited thrombophilias factor V Leiden, prothrombin G 20210 A, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C 677 T were genotyped by PCR-RFLP. Activated protein C resistance and plasma levels of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S were also measured. Results. The frequency of thrombophilia-associated SNPs, activated protein C resistance, and anticoagulant protein deficiencies, was low overall, except for the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C 677 T SNP.

40|$|The {{apparent}} stasis in {{the evolution}} of avian chromosomes suggests that birds may have experienced relatively low rates of gene gain and loss in multigene families. To investigate this possibility and to explore the phenotypic consequences of variation in gene copy number, we examined evolutionary changes in the families of genes that encode the a- and b-type subunits of hemoglobin (Hb), the tetrameric a 2 b 2 protein responsible for blood-O 2 transport. A comparative genomic analysis of 52 bird species revealed that the size and membership composition of the a- and b-globin gene families have remained remarkably constant during approximately 100 My of avian evolution. Most interspecific variation in gene content is attributable to multiple independent inactivations of the aD-globin gene, which encodes the a-chain subunit of a functionally distinct Hb isoform (HbD) that is expressed in both embryonic and definitive erythrocytes. Due to con-sistent differences in O 2 -binding properties between HbD and the major adult-expressed Hb isoform, HbA (which incorporates products of the aA-globin gene), <b>recurrent</b> <b>losses</b> of aD-globin contribute to among-species variation in blood-O 2 affinity. Analysis of HbA/HbD expression levels in the red blood cells of 122 bird species revealed high variability among lineages and strong phylogenetic signal.

40|$|Numerous {{instances}} of presence/absence variations for introns {{have been documented}} in eukaryotes, and some cases of recurrent loss of the same intron have been suggested. However, {{there has been no}} comprehensive or phylogenetically deep analysis of recurrent intron loss. Of 883 cases of intron presence/absence variation that we detected in five sequenced grass genomes, 93 were confirmed as <b>recurrent</b> <b>losses</b> and the rest could be explained by single losses (652) or single gains (118). No case of recurrent intron gain was observed. Deep phylogenetic analysis often indicated that apparent intron gains were actually numerous independent losses of the same intron. Recurrent loss exhibited extreme non-randomness, in that some introns were removed independently in many lineages. The two larger genomes, maize and sorghum, were found to have a higher rate of both recurrent loss and overall loss and/or gain than foxtail millet, rice or Brachypodium. Adjacent introns and small introns were found to be preferentially lost. Intron loss genes exhibited a high frequency of germ line or early embryogenesis expression. In addition, flanking exon A+T-richness and intron TG/CG ratios were higher in retained introns. This last result suggests that epigenetic status, as evidenced by a loss of methylated CG dinucleotides, {{may play a role in}} the process of intron loss.

We found a significant correlation between the tumor stage and lowered expression of MYO 1 C in endometrial carcinoma samples. In cell transfection experiments, we found a negative correlation between MYO 1 C expression and cell proliferation, and MYO 1 C silencing resulted in diminished cell migration and adhesion. Cells expressing excess of MYO 1 C had low basal level of phosphorylated protein kinase B (PKB, a. k. a.

HPLC technique with new modified method was used to estimate serum leptin and insulin hormones in samples of women with <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>loss</b> (patients group, n= 64) and healthy pregnant women {{at the end of}} the third gestational trimester as a control group (n= 51). Results: Both serum leptin and insulin levels were high {{in women with}} pregnancy loss in their three trimesters. A significant correlation was found between age (r= 0. 535, p< 0. 018) and serum total leptin in women with RPL during the first trimester. Also, a highly significant correlation was found between serum total leptin and insulin in women with RPL during the first, second and third trimesters (r= 0. 894, r= 0. 931, and r = 0. 995) respectively. The number of women who lost their pregnancy during the first trimester was higher than those losing during other trimesters.

40|$|Abstract The study set out {{to examine}} the {{predictive}} effects of patients ’ emotional distress and their relation-ships with their health care providers on satisfaction with obstetric services in high-risk pregnancies. Participants were 104 pregnant women {{with a history of}} <b>recurrent</b> <b>losses,</b> fetal demise, previous or current fetal genetic abnormality, advanced maternal age, or obstetric or med-ical complications of the present pregnancy. Self-report measures of emotional distress and the quality of their relationships with their medical provider were adminis-tered. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess the predictive effect of these variables on satisfaction with services. Provision of information, constructive communication, and good relationships pre-dicted elevated satisfaction with health services. Provision of information also buffered against the adverse effect of emotional distress on satisfaction with health services. These findings elucidate the central role of provider– patient interaction, particularly as it is related to provision of information, in high-risk pregnancy. Keywords High-risk pregnancy Patient–doctor relationships Emotional distress Medical information Women’s health Pregnant women at high-risk for adverse pregnancy out-come secondary to previous or current pregnancy complications are likely to experience considerable emo-tional distress (Kurki, Hiilesmaa, Raitasalo, Mattila, & Ylikorkala, 2000; Orr & Miller, 1995).

40|$|Summary In the {{pathogenesis}} of cervical carcinoma there are three major components, two of them related {{to the role of}} human papillomaviruses (HPV). First, the effect of viral E 6 and E 7 proteins. Second, the integration of viral DNA in chromosomal regions associated with well known tumour phenotypes. Some of these viral integrations occur recurrently at specific chromosomal locations, such as 8 q 24 and 12 q 15, both harbouring HPV 18 and HPV 16. And third, there are other recurrent genetic alterations not linked to HPV. <b>Recurrent</b> <b>losses</b> of heterozygosity (LOH) have been detected in chromosome regions 3 p 14 – 22, 4 p 16, 5 p 15, 6 p 21 – 22, 11 q 23, 17 p 13. 3 without effect on p 53, 18 q 12 – 22 and 19 q 13, all of them suggesting the alteration of putative tumour suppressor genes not yet identified. Recurrent amplification has been mapped to 3 q+ arm, with the common region in 3 q 24 – 28 in 90 % of invasive carcinomas. The mutator phenotype, microsatellite instability, plays a minor role and is detected in only 7 % of cervical carcinomas. The development of cervical carcinoma requires the sequential occurrence and selection of several genetic alterations. The identification of the specific genes involved, and their correlation with specific tumour properties and stages could improve the understanding and perhaps the management of cervical carcinoma...|$|E
40|$|Prognostic {{biomarkers}} {{are needed}} for superficial gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) to predict clinical outcomes and select therapy. Although recurrent mutations have been characterized in EAC, {{little is known about}} their clinical and prognostic significance. Aneuploidy is predictive of clinical outcome in many malignancies but has not been evaluated in superficial EAC. We quantified copy number changes in 41 superficial EAC using Affymetrix SNP 6. 0 arrays. We identified recurrent chromosomal gains and losses and calculated the total copy number abnormality (CNA) count for each tumor as a measure of aneuploidy. We correlated CNA count with overall survival and time to first recurrence in univariate and multivariate analyses. Recurrent segmental gains and losses involved multiple genes, including: HER 2, EGFR, MET, CDK 6, KRAS (recurrent gains); and FHIT, WWOX, CDKN 2 A/B, SMAD 4, RUNX 1 (<b>recurrent</b> <b>losses).</b> There was a 40 -fold variation in CNA count across all cases. Tumors with the lowest and highest quartile CNA count had significantly better overall survival (p =  0. 032) and time to first recurrence (p =  0. 010) compared to those with intermediate CNA counts. These associations persisted when controlling for other prognostic variables. SNP arrays facilitate the assessment of recurrent chromosomal gain and loss and allow high resolution, quantitative assessment of segmental aneuploidy (total CNA count). The non-monotonic association of segmental aneuploidy with survival has been described in other tumors. The degree of aneuploidy is a promising prognostic biomarker in a potentially curable form of EAC...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hyperhomocysteinemia {{has been}} {{described}} as a risk factor for unexplained <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>loss.</b> Increased levels of homocysteine may be due to inadequate dietary intake of folate and vitamin B 12 and inherited defects within the methionine-homocysteine pathway such as MTHFR C 677 T gene polymorphism. However, the association between hyperhomocysteinemia and sterility problems have been underlined only for <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>loss</b> while a relationship between hyperhomocysteinemia and female sterility is still matter of discussion. AIM: This study sought to find out a possible relationship between sterility (primary sterility or secondary sterility due to <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>loss)</b> and homocysteine metabolism. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected 20 patients with <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>loss,</b> 20 patients with unexplained female sterility and 20 healthy women as control group. Several whole blood samples were collected by venipuncture. Firstly homocysteinemia and other related variables were tested (i. e. folate and vitamin B 12 levels); thereafter DNA was extracted by a further whole blood sample collected in EDTA in order to screen MTHFR C 677 T gene polymorphism. Statistical analysis was performed by chi square test; differences were considered to be significant if p 15 microM) and MTHFR C 677 T homozigosity have already been described as risk factors for <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>loss,</b> few studies evaluated their role in women with unexplained sterility. Further studies on larger series are needed to better understand the role of homocysteine metabolism, including folate metabolism, in this clinical setting...|$|R
40|$|<b>Recurrent</b> {{pregnancy}} <b>loss</b> is a frequently occurring human infertility-related disease affecting ~ 1 % of women. It {{has been}} estimated that the cause remains unexplained in > 50 % cases which strongly suggests that genetic factors may contribute towards the phenotype. Concerning its molecular aetiology numerous studies have had limited success in identifying the disease's genetic causes. This might have been {{due to the fact that}} hundreds of genes are involved in each physiological step necessary for guaranteeing reproductive success in mammals. In such scenario, next generation sequencing provides a potentially interesting tool for research into <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>loss</b> causative mutations. The present study involved whole-exome sequencing and an innovative bioinformatics analysis, for the first time, in 49 unrelated women affected by <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>loss.</b> We identified 27 coding variants (22 genes) potentially related to the phenotype (41 % of patients). The affected genes, which were enriched by potentially deleterious sequence variants, belonged to distinct molecular cascades playing key roles in implantation/pregnancy biology. Using a quantum chemical approach method we established that mutations in MMP- 10 and FGA proteins led to substantial energetic modifications suggesting an impact on their functions and/or stability. The next generation sequencing and bioinformatics approaches presented here represent an efficient way to find mutations, having potentially moderate/strong functional effects, associated with <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>loss</b> aetiology. We consider that some of these variants (and genes) represent probable future biomarkers for <b>recurrent</b> pregnancy <b>loss...</b>|$|R
