5000|$|Renewable {{energy and}} energy {{efficiency}} are sometimes {{said to be}} the [...] "twin pillars" [...] of sustainable energy policy. Both resources must be developed in order to stabilize and reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Efficiency slows down energy demand growth so that rising clean energy supplies can make deep cuts in fossil fuel use.

As a result, despite energy efficiency gains, total energy use and related carbon emissions have continued to increase. Thus, given the thermodynamic and practical limits of energy efficiency improvements, slowing the growth in energy demand is essential. However, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{empirical}} virtual sliding target (VST) guidance {{law for the}} midcourse phase of a long range surface-to-air missile that uses {{the simplicity of the}} conventional proportional navigation (PN) guidance law while exploiting the aerodynamic characteristics of a missile’s flight through the atmosphere to enable the missile to achieve superior performance than that achieved by conventional PN guidance laws. The missile trajectory emulates the trajectory of an optimal control based guidance law formulated on a realistic aerodynamic model of the missile-target engagement. The trajectory of the missile is controlled by controlling the speed of a virtual target that slides towards a predicted intercept point during the midcourse phase. Several sliding schemes, both linear and nonlinear, are proposed and the effect of the variation of the sliding parameters, which control the sliding speed of the virtual target, on the missile performance, are examined through extensive simulations that take into account the atmospheric characteristics as well as limitations on the missile in terms of the energy available and lateral acceleration limits. Launch envelopes for these sliding schemes for approaching and <b>receding</b> <b>targets</b> are also obtained. These results amply demonstrate the superiority of the proposed guidance law over the conventional PN law...|$|R
40|$|The role of two {{binocular}} cues to {{motion in}} depth - changing disparity (CD) and interocular velocity difference (IOVD) - was investigated by measuring stereomotion speed discrimination and static disparity discrimination performance (stereoacuity). Speed discrimination thresholds were assessed both for random dot stereograms (RDS), {{and for their}} temporally uncorrelated equivalents, dynamic random dot stereograms (DRDS), at relative disparity pedestals of - 19, 0, and + 19 arcmin. While RDS stimuli contain both CD and IOVD cues, DRDS stimuli carry only CD information. On average, thresholds were a factor of 1. 7 higher for DRDS than for RDS stimuli with no clear effect of relative disparity pedestal. Results were similar for approaching and <b>receding</b> <b>targets.</b> Variations in stimulus duration had no significant effect on thresholds, {{and there was no}} observed correlation between stimulus displacement and perceived speed, confirming that subjects responded to stimulus speed in each condition. Stereoacuity was equally good for our RDS and DRDS stimuli, showing that the difference in stereomotion speed discrimination performance for these stimuli was not due to any difference in the precision of the disparity cue. In addition, when we altered stereomotion stimulus trajectory by independently manipulating the speeds and directions of its monocular half-images, perceived stereomotion speed remained accurate. This finding is inconsistent with response strategies based on properties of either monocular half-image motion, or any ad hoc combination of the monocular speeds. We conclude that although subjects are able to discriminate stereomotion speed reliably on the basis of CD information alone, IOVD provides a precise additional cue to stereomotion speed perception. 19 page(s...|$|R

By and large, a deviant or an unexpected stimulus in a series of similar events (same duration, same features) can elicit a relative overestimation of subjective time (or “time dilation”) but, as is shown here, this is not always the case.

40|$|A {{wealth of}} {{evidence}} now shows that {{human and animal}} observers display greater sensitivity to objects that move toward them than to objects that remain static or move away. Increased sensitivity in humans is often evidenced by reaction times that increase in rank order from looming, to <b>receding,</b> to static <b>targets.</b> However, {{it is not clear}} whether the processing advantage enjoyed by looming motion is mediated by the attention system or the motor system. The present study investigated this by first examining whether sensitivity is to looming motion per se or to certain monocular or binocular cues that constitute stereoscopic motion in depth. None of the cues accounted for the looming advantage. A perceptual measure was then used to examine performance with minimal involvement of the motor system. Results showed that looming and receding motion were equivalent in attracting attention, suggesting that the looming advantage is indeed mediated by the motor system.

40|$|Purpose. Accommodation can mask {{hyperopia}} {{and reduce}} the accuracy of non-cycloplegic refraction. It is, therefore, important to minimize accommodation to obtain a measure of hyperopia as accurate as possible. To characterize the parameters required to measure the maximally hyperopic error using photorefraction, we used different target types and distances to determine which target was most likely to maximally relax accommodation and thus more accurately detect hyperopia in an individual. Methods. A PlusoptiX SO 4 infra-red photorefractor was mounted in a remote haploscope which presented the targets. All participants were tested with targets at four fixation distances between 0. 3 and 2 m containing all combinations of blur, disparity, and proximity/looming cues. Thirty-eight infants (6 to 44 weeks) were studied longitudinally, and 104 children [4 to 15 years (mean 6. 4) ] and 85 adults, {{with a range of}} refractive errors and binocular vision status, were tested once. Cycloplegic refraction data were available for a sub-set of 59 participants spread across the age range. Results. The maximally hyperopic refraction (MHR) found {{at any time in the}} session was most frequently found when fixating the most distant targets and those containing disparity and dynamic proximity/looming cues. Presence or absence of blur was less significant, and targets in which only single cues to depth were present were also less likely to produce MHR. MHR correlated closely with cycloplegic refraction (r = 0. 93, mean difference 0. 07 D, p = n. s., 95 % confidence interval +/-< 0. 25 D) after correction by a calibration factor. Conclusions. Maximum relaxation of accommodation occurred for binocular <b>targets</b> <b>receding</b> into the distance. Proximal and disparity cues aid relaxation of accommodation to a greater extent than blur, and thus non-cycloplegic refraction targets should incorporate these cues. This is especially important in screening contexts with a brief opportunity to test for significant hyperopia. MHR in our laboratory was found to be a reliable estimation of cycloplegic refraction.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{development}} of guidance laws for advanced applications. Two class of guidance problems, namely, impact angle constrained guidance and pulsed guidance for exo-atmospheric engagements, are considered here. Three impact angle constrained guidance schemes are developed using (i) Proportional navigation guidance (PNG), (ii) State Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) technique and (iii) geometric concepts, respectively. A collision course based pulsed guidance law is presented for exo-atmospheric interceptors. Proportional Navigation Guidance (PNG) {{law is the}} most widely used guidance law because of its ease of implementation and efficiency. However, in its original form, it achieves only a limited set of impact angles. A two stage PNG law is presented for achieving all impact angles against a stationary target. In the first phase of guidance, an orientation PNG command is used. The orientation navigation constant (N) {{is a function of the}} initial engagement geometry and has a lower value (N less than 2). It is proved that following the orientation trajectory, the interceptor can switch to N = 2 and achieve the desired impact angle. Simulations, with a constant speed and with a realistic interceptor model, show successful interception of the target with all desired impact angles. Feedback implementation of the guidance law results in negligible errors in impact angle with uncompensated autopilot delays. The idea of a two-stage PNG law with impact angle constraint is further used to develop a guidance law for intercepting moving targets. Following the orientation trajectory, the interceptor can switch to N = 3 and achieve the desired impact angle. It is proved that the guidance achieves all impact angles in a surface-to-surface engagement scenario with <b>receding</b> and approaching <b>targets,</b> respectively. In a air-to-surface engagement scenario, it is proved that the guidance law achieves all impact angles in a deterministic set. Constant speed and realistic interceptor models are used for simulations. Results show negligible error in impact angle and miss distance for moving targets. The guidance law, in its feedback implementation form, achieves the desired impact angle for interceptors with delay and with a maneuvering target. The impact angle errors are low with negligible errors in miss distance. Next, the impact angle constrained guidance problem against a stationary target is solved as a non-linear regulator problem using the SDRE technique. The interceptor guidance problems are of finite time nature. As the main contribution of this part of the work, we solve a finite time interceptor guidance problem with infinite horizon SDRE formulation by choosing the state weighting matrix as a function of time-to-go. Numerical simulations are carried out both for a constant speed interceptor model and a realistic interceptor model. Simulations for both the models are carried out for various impact angles and firing angles. Robustness of the proposed guidance law with respect to autopilot lag is also verified by simulations. Results obtained show the efficiency of the SDRE approach for impact angle constrained missile guidance. A geometric guidance scheme is proposed for lateral interception of targets in a planar engagement scenario in the absence of line-of-sight rate information. A kill-band is defined for target initial positions capturable by an arc maneuver, followed by a straight line path by the interceptor. Guidance law for capturing targets inside the kill-band is presented and is further modified for targets outside the kill-band. Based on analytical studies on the kill-band, a guidance law is proposed for lateral interception of maneuvering targets. Simulations are carried with for typical low speed engagements. The concept of kill-band provides an inherent robustness to the proposed guidance law with respect to uncompensated system delays and target maneuver. As the final part of the work, an interceptor endgame pulsed guidance law for exoatmospheric engagements is derived by using the notion of collision heading. The proposed guidance law is derived in steps by (i) Obtaining the collision heading based on the collision triangle engagement geometry and then (ii) Computing the width of the pulse fired by the divert thruster to attain the collision heading. It is shown that this strategy is more effective than the existing zero effort miss (ZEM) based guidance laws for intercepting targets with higher heading angles off the nominal head-on collision course. A result on pulse firing sequence is also presented showing that firing pulses in quick succession results in minimum pulse widths and hence minimum control effort for a desired miss distance. Simulations are carried out for various engagement scenarios. Results show better miss-distance and divert thrust performance as compared to the existing ZEM based law...|$|R
