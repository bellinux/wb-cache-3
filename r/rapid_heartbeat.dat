In {{a number}} of cases, death has {{occurred}} within 24 hours of {{the onset of the}} infection, while other cases do not last longer than around five days. The virus attacks endothelial cells, rupturing capillaries and causing blood loss and haemorrhaging; once this reaches the heart, the haemorrhage kills quickly through shock. Symptoms include lethargy and an unwillingness to eat, a <b>rapid</b> <b>heartbeat,</b> and decreased blood-cell count, as well as cyanosis of the tongue, mouth ulcers, and oedema of the head and trunk.|$|E
25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} MDMA use include addiction, memory problems, paranoia, {{difficulty}} sleeping, teeth grinding, blurred vision, sweating, and a <b>rapid</b> <b>heartbeat.</b> Use may {{also lead to}} depression and fatigue. Deaths have been reported due to increased body temperature and dehydration. MDMA increases the release and slows the reuptake of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine {{in parts of the}} brain. It has stimulant and psychedelic effects. The initial increase is followed by a short-term decrease in the neurotransmitters. MDMA belongs to the substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine and substituted amphetamine classes of drugs.|$|E
25|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Rock the Nation Tour, Kiss performed only sporadically for a number of years. The group played two shows in 2005, and another six in 2006. Four of the 2006 shows were July concerts in Japan, including two dates (July 22 and 23) as a headlining act at the 2006 Udo Music Festival. Kiss performed four July 2007 concerts, three of which were dubbed the Hit 'N Run Tour. Prior to the final show on July 27, Stanley was hospitalized with an extremely <b>rapid</b> <b>heartbeat.</b> In his absence, Kiss performed in concert as a trio {{for the first time since}} 1982. This was the first Kiss concert that Stanley had missed during his then 34-year tenure with the group.|$|E

25|$|Chiefs quarterback Steve DeBerg {{completed}} a play-action 11-yard {{touchdown pass to}} wide receiver Fred Jones in the second quarter, which was the difference in K.C.'s narrow 10–6 win over long-time rival Los Angeles. K.C. running back Barry Word was arguably the Chiefs' most effective offensive weapon, rushing for 133 yards. This was Kansas City's first postseason win since Super Bowl IV in the 1969 season. The Raiders started rookie quarterback Todd Marinovich over veteran Jay Schroeder. Marinovich, who performed well in a loss to Kansas City the week before, instead threw four interceptions in the wild card rematch, including the one to Kansas City defensive back Deron Cherry that set up DeBerg's touchdown. Kansas City's defense managed to hold Los Angeles to six points despite losing star linebacker Derrick Thomas, who {{was diagnosed with a}} <b>rapid</b> <b>heartbeat</b> and rushed to the hospital {{near the end of the}} first half.|$|E
2500|$|Agoraphobia {{patients}} can experience sudden panic attacks when traveling {{to places where}} they fear {{they are out of}} control, help would be difficult to obtain, or they could be embarrassed. During a panic attack, epinephrine is released in large amounts, triggering the body's natural fight-or-flight response. A panic attack typically has an abrupt onset, building to maximum intensity within 10 to 15 minutes, and rarely lasts longer than 30 minutes. [...] Symptoms of a panic attack include palpitations, <b>rapid</b> <b>heartbeat,</b> sweating, trembling, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, tightness in the throat, and shortness of breath. Many patients report a fear of dying or of losing control of emotions and/or behaviors.|$|E
2500|$|In some cases, {{the attack}} may {{continue}} at unabated high intensity, or {{seem to be}} increasing in severity. Common symptoms of an attack include <b>rapid</b> <b>heartbeat,</b> perspiration, dizziness, dyspnea, trembling, uncontrollable fear such as: the fear of losing control and going crazy, the fear of dying [...] and hyperventilation. Other symptoms are sweating, a sensation of choking, paralysis, chest pain, nausea, numbness or tingling, chills or hot flashes, faintness, crying [...] and some sense of altered reality. In addition, the person usually has thoughts of impending doom. Individuals suffering from an episode have often a strong wish of escaping from the situation that provoked the attack. The anxiety of panic disorder is particularly severe and noticeably episodic compared to that from generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks may be provoked by exposure to certain stimuli (e.g., seeing a mouse) or settings (e.g., the dentist's office). Other attacks may appear unprovoked. Some individuals deal with these events on a regular basis, sometimes daily or weekly. The outward symptoms of a panic attack often cause negative social experiences (e.g., embarrassment, social stigma, social isolation, etc.).|$|E

2500|$|Historically, and {{possibly}} {{related to the}} [...] "Reefer Madness" [...] legend, some people (particularly Americans) had confused cannabis with Jimson weed (Datura stramonium). Jimson weed, which grows wild in the United States and several other countries, is a potent deliriant which can cause true hallucinations and delusions that are believed by the user to be real, {{as opposed to the}} pseudohallucinations and perceptual distortions typically caused by cannabis. Confusion could have resulted from the fact that Daturas common name contains the word [...] "weed," [...] which is also a slang term for cannabis, and the fact that both plants (as well as others) have been given the moniker [...] "locoweed" [...] {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. [...] Aside from these superficial similarities, the two plants are not related and have very little to do with one another, and thus should not be confused. [...] Jimson weed is highly toxic and can cause delirium, confusion, hallucinations, blurred vision, photophobia, dry mouth, urinary retention, hyperthermia, incoordination, hypertension, and <b>rapid</b> <b>heartbeat</b> among other effects. [...] An overdose (or suspected overdose) on this substance is a medical emergency, as it can cause seizures, coma, or death by cardiac arrest.|$|E

40|$|Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF), causing irregular and <b>rapid</b> <b>heartbeats,</b> is {{the most}} common arrhythmia. Due to the widespread impact on the population and the disabling symptoms related to rapid heart rate, AF is a subject of growing interest under several aspects: statistical analyses on the heartbeat distributions, risk factors, impact on quality of life, correlation with other cardiac pathologies. However, several key points on the consequences induced by AF on the cardiovascular system are still not completely understood. The proposed work aims at quantifying the impact of AF on the most relevant cardiovascular parameters by means of a lumped-parameter modeling, paying particular attention to the stochastic nature of the irregular heartbeats and the reduced contractility of the heart. The global response leads to a rather impressive overall agreement with the clinical state-of-the-art measures regarding AF: reduced cardiac output with correlated arterial hypotension, as well as higher left atrial volume and pressure values {{are some of the most}} representative outcomes emerging during AF. Moreover, new insights on hemodynamic parameters such as cardiac flow rates, which are difficult to measure and almost never offered in literature, are here provide...|$|R

Approximately 400, 000 Americans die every year from sudden heart attacks. Medical research revealed that patterns of electrical activity in the heart can act as predictors of these lethal cardiac events known as arrhythmias. Fortunately, certain arrhythmias such as ventricular fibrillation (loss of regular heartbeat and subsequent loss of function) and ventricular tachycardia (<b>rapid</b> <b>heartbeats),</b> can be detected and appropriately treated. Today, patients at moderate risk of arrhythmias can benefit from technology that would permit long- term continuous monitoring of electrical cardiac rhythms outside the hospital environment in the comfort of their own homes. Medical telemetry systems, also known as telemedicine, are evolving rapidly as wireless communication technology advances, evidenced by the commercial products and research prototypes for remote health monitoring that have appeared in recent years. Wireless systems allow patients to move freely in their home and work environment while being monitored remotely by health care professionals...|$|R

50|$|Rotigaptide {{is being}} studied for its {{antiarrhythmic}} effects, specifically for treating atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is an irregular and often rapid heart rhythm. The irregular rhythm, results from abnormal electrical impulses in the heart. The irregularity can be continuous or intermittent. In atrial fibrillation, multiple impulses {{travel through the}} atria at the same time. Instead of a coordinated contraction, the atrial contractions are irregular, disorganized and very rapid. These irregular impulses reach the AV node in rapid succession, {{but not all of}} them make it past the AV node. Therefore, the ventricles beat slower in an irregular rhythm. The resulting <b>rapid,</b> irregular <b>heartbeat</b> causes an irregular pulse and sometimes a sensation of fluttering in the chest.|$|R
