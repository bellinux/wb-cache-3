5000|$|Proposed {{changes in}} late 2005 would have {{weakened}} the reporting {{standards for the}} TRI program. Several state attorneys general wrote to EPA asking that the standard not be altered. The proposed revisions came under fire from Eliot Spitzer, then the Attorney General for New York, who said [...] "Public disclosure {{has proven to be}} a strong incentive for polluters to reduce their use of toxic chemicals, this move by EPA appears to be yet another poorly considered notion to appease a few polluting constituents at the expense of a valuable program." [...] EPA originally proposed to reduce the required <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency</b> from every year to every other year. This drew intense criticism, and the idea was dropped.|$|E
5000|$|However, EPA {{went forward}} with {{another part of}} the plan that {{initially}} did not receive much attention. Companies were previously required to disclose any release over 2000 pounds (907 kg) on a more detailed [...] "Form R" [...] rather than the less detailed [...] "Form A." [...] With the new regulations, the minimum reporting requirements for Form R have been increased to 5000 pounds (2268 kg), thus reducing the amount of information available. Although this move was widely criticized by the public as well as many officials, EPA went ahead with the new rule anyway. EPA claimed that the comments submitted opposed to the Form R requirements were invalid because nearly all the people who had commented did so on both the change in <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency</b> as well as the minimum amounts required for Form R.|$|E
50|$|The two above {{regulations}} apply towards all eurozone member states, {{and together}} form a stronger budgetary governance {{with a more}} tight system of monitoring and surveillance by the European Commission. According to article 136 in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the enactment and entry into force of the regulations required the Council's adoption {{in agreement with the}} European Parliament, subject to a qualified majority of the 17 eurozone member states. The ECOFIN council reached a final agreement with the Parliament's Permanent Representatives Committee on 20 February 2013. The parliament then adopted the two-pack on 12 March, with the first regulation passed by 526 voting for towards 86 against and 66 abstentions, and with the second regulation passed by 528 voting for towards 81 against and 71 abstentions. Subsequently the two-pack was finally adopted by the Council of the European Union on 13 May, with publication of the legal acts in the Official Journal of the European Union on 27 May, and the official legal entry into force on 30 May 2013. Most provisions will apply from the date of entry into force.

40|$|Communicative {{strategies}} {{not only}} {{play an important}} role in communication but they also contribute to second language acquisition. Communicative strategies (CS) can help to keep the communication channel open, encourage hypothesis formation and automatization. The overall aim of this essay is to find out whether there is a relationship between Chinese English learners’ attitudes toward the use of communicative strategies and the <b>reported</b> <b>frequency</b> of using them in actual communication. Forty Chinese English majors are selected randomly to participate in this investigation. They were divided into two different groups according to their different level of language proficiency. The main methods of this essay are two questionnaires and an interview.   Based on the framework of achievement strategies and reduction strategies and through the investigation of the relationship between the attitude toward communicative strategies and the <b>reported</b> <b>frequency</b> of using them in communication, three tentative conclusions have been drawn. Firstly, a learner’s attitude of CS has some influence on the use of CS. Secondly; Chinese learners of English tend to use reduction strategies most often. Finally, Chinese learners seldom use achievement strategies although they tend to believe the important role of achievement strategies in communication. What is more, this essay also analyzes the two groups of students’ different attitudes and different <b>reported</b> <b>frequency</b> of using CS and finds some reasons for those differences. After the above analyses, the essay categorizes three main factors which affect learners’ attitudes and their <b>reported</b> <b>frequency</b> of using CS. It includes the learner itself, the learning context, and the communication context...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to identify the factors determining the <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency</b> of experience data e. g. incidents and accidents. The empirical setting is the Norwegian controlled merchant fleet. Data were collected from a survey carried out in 2006, where 1262 questionnaires were gathered from 76 vessels. The data were subjected to explorative factor analysis, method of principal component and varimax rotation. Seven factors, representing latent dimensions of safety culture, were extracted. Internal consistency (Cronbach Alpha) and scale reliability were found to be acceptable. The factor scores were used in an ordered logistic regression to examine the factors’ relationships to <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency.</b> The results show that enhanced safety related training, a trusting and open relationship among the crew, safety oriented ship management, performance of pro-active risk identification activities and feedback on reported events all are significantly related to higher <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency.</b> On the other hand, demand for efficiency and lack of attention to safety from shore personnel, are significantly related to lower <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency.</b> The results also show a significantly lower <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency</b> among those who have worked with their local manager less than 1 year.

30|$|As a major global exchange, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) only {{requires}} semi-annual reporting whereas {{other major}} exchanges including {{the ones in}} Chinese mainland require quarterly reporting. We argue against the traditional view that higher <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency</b> is necessarily more beneficial. The decision on <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency</b> depends on how the information is being processed by the recipient traders {{and the results are}} not obvious. Using a sample of Chinese companies dual-listed in both China A share market and SEHK (AH shares) as the experimental group and mainland’s companies listed on SEHK (H shares) only as the control group, we apply the difference-in-difference (DID) method to investigate the impacts of <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency</b> on stock information quality. The results suggest that after China A share market require quarterly financial reporting for all listed companies in 2002, the information asymmetry of the H tranche of AH stocks increases. Different from prior studies, the results suggest a negative association between stock information quality and financial <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency.</b> We argue that the increased information asymmetry in the H tranche is caused by the noise spilled over from the A tranche. We conduct multivariable GARCH tests and find evidence supporting this conjecture.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} whether {{the choice between}} quarterly and semiannual reporting affects the precision of investors' information and their private information acquisition activities. In {{the first part of}} this study, we show that a firm's <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency</b> has no effect on the average precision of investors' information. However, our analysis of announcement-period price variance and share turnover shows that an increase in <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency</b> does make interim and annual financial reports a more important component of investors' information set, relative to other sources of information. In particular, the results of this analysis suggest that investors of semiannual reporters hold more precise pre-announcement information than investors of quarterly reporters. In the second part of our study, we test one explanation for this finding. We argue that an increase in a firm's <b>reporting</b> <b>frequency</b> reduces investors' incentives to acquire private information between consecutive announcement dates and, consequently, should reduce information asymmetry among investors, increase share liquidity, and stimulate trading. Consistent with this reasoning, we find that quarterly reporters have lower average bid-ask spreads and higher abnormal share turnover than semiannual reporters.
