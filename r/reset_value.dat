40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{observer}} {{design for a}} class of single-output nonlinear systems with Markov jumps. The Markov jump process interferes with a deterministic nonlinear dynamics at random times and retains its state for {{a certain amount of}} time (dwell time). The estimation process is reset at these random times, depending on the <b>reset</b> <b>values</b> of the state process, and then evolves as a deterministic estimate of the state process itself. The novelty is given by the reset mechanism adopted for the estimation process itself, depending on the <b>reset</b> <b>values</b> of the slate process. We prove that, as long as the mathematical expectation of the dwell times has a positive lower bound and the transition rate of the jump process at the first exit time out of any point is bounded, the state estimation error of the switching dynamics asymptotically converges to zero with probability one. The state estimate over each dwell time is designed using the novel technique of 'output immersion': each single-output nonlinear dynamics is 'immersed' into a system with as many outputs as its states. The immersed dynamics can be split into one-dimensional dynamics each one with its state and output. By estimating the state of each one-dimensional dynamics we determine a state estimator for the dynamics before immersion. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

30|$|There is a {{more subtle}} issue pointed out in [53]. We do not only discretize time for each neuron’ spikes, we align the spikes emitted by {{distinct}} neurons on a discrete-time grid, as an experimental raster does. As shown in [32] this induces, in gIF models with a purely deterministic dynamics (no noise and reset to a constant value), an artificial synchronization. As a consequence, the deterministic dynamics of gIF models has generically only stable periodic orbits, although periods can be larger than any accessible computational time in a specific region of the parameters space. Additionally, these periods increase as δ decreases. The addition of noise on dynamics and on the <b>reset</b> <b>value,</b> as we propose in this paper, removes this synchronization effect.|$|E
40|$|Phase {{resetting}} curves {{characterize the}} way a system with a collective periodic behavior responds to perturbations. We consider globally coupled ensembles of Sakaguchi-Kuramoto oscillators, and use the Ott-Antonsen theory of ensemble evolution to derive the analytical phase resetting equations. We show the final phase <b>reset</b> <b>value</b> to be composed of two parts: an immediate phase reset directly caused by the perturbation, and the dynamical phase reset resulting from the relaxation of the perturbed system back to its dynamical equilibrium. Analytical, semi-analytical and numerical approximations of the final phase resetting curve are constructed. We support our findings with extensive numerical evidence involving identical and non-identical oscillators. The validity of our theory is discussed {{in the context of}} large ensembles approximating the thermodynamic limit. Comment: submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|E

40|$|The present work is {{motivated}} by biological questions about the behavior of membrane potentials in neurons. A commonly used model for spiking neurons is to assume that between spikes the membrane potential is given by a diffusion process X = (Xt) t≥ 0 which is a solution of an SDE dXt = β(Xt) dt + σ(Xt) dBt where (Bt) t≥ 0 is a standard Brownian motion. The spiking behavior is usually explained as follows. Whenever X reaches a certain excitation threshold S, a spike occurs. Thereafter the potential is set down to a certain <b>reset</b> <b>value</b> x 0 again. In applications it is sometimes possible to observe the diffusion process X between spikes by estimating the drift coefficient β(·) and the diffusion coefficient σ(·) from real data. Nevertheless, S and x 0 have to be determined in order to fix the model. However, in real data this is not obvious at all. One possible approach is to view x 0 and S as parameters in a statistical model and to estimate them. In the present work, we discuss four cases fo...|$|E
30|$|The {{single cell}} {{reduction}} proposed {{in this article}} considers the bursting Izhikevich neuron merely as an example. We indeed assumed the <b>reset</b> <b>value</b> c {{to be higher than}} the local minimum of the V nullcline (i.e. c > − 62.5) and d> 0. Although this particular formulation might not be applicable when the parameters at hand do not correspond with the bursting type, we believe that the procedure here can be generalized for all relevant choices of parameters. Going even further, it appears to us that, besides the Izhikevich and other integrate-and-fire models, also higher dimensional models can be reduced in a similar manner; that is, leaving the subthreshold dynamics intact by only adjusting the dynamics in the suprathreshold regime. In this regime, one should seek to eliminate the (very) fast dynamics and determine their contribution on the slow variables. Yet, these fast variables can play a prominent role in the subthreshold dynamics (e.g. to generate post-inhibitory rebound potentials). Elimination of all fast variables could therefore have an unanticipated (and hence undesirable) effect on the subthreshold behavior. So caution is required when constructing firing rate reductions.|$|E
40|$|Acquiring {{detailed}} {{knowledge of}} surface treatments effectiveness {{is required to}} improve performance-based decisions for allocating resources to preserve and maintain pavements on any road network. Measurement of treatment effectiveness is a complex task that requires historical records of treatments with observations of before and after performance trends. Lack of data is often an obstacle that impedes development and incorporation of surface maintenance treatments into pavement management. This paper analyzes the effect of surface treatments on asphalt paved arterial roads for several control sections of New Brunswick. The method uses a Transition Probability Matrix to capture main effects by mapping mean trends of surface improvement and pavement structure decay. It was found that surface treatments have an immediate effect reducing the rate of loss of structural capacity. Pavements with international roughness index (IRI) smaller than 1. 4 m/km {{did not seem to}} benefit from surface treatments.

The process stability for an extended operational time period T. sub. o is verified by performing the resetting step at the end of at least one reset time period T. sub. r whose duration is less than the operational time period T. sub. o and then confirming {{stability of}} the process over the reset time period T. sub. r.

40|$|Retiming {{is often}} used to {{optimize}} synchronous sequential circuits for area or delay or both. If the latches 1 that are retimed have a hardware <b>reset</b> <b>value,</b> the initial state of the circuit must also be retimed, i. e. an initial state must be derived for the retimed circuit. Previously, {{it has been suggested that}} this can be avoided if the hardware reset signals are represented explicitly. However, it was thought that this adds unnecessary area and restricts the space of possible retimings. In this paper we demonstrate that this is not the case. In addition, we show that this methodology does not require the restriction that all reset signals be asserted at the beginning of circuit operation — a restriction that was imposed by existing algorithms for determining the retimed initial state. Finally we show how our explicit reset (ER) framework enables us to retime when some latches may be driven by different hardware resets, and some others may not have any hardware resets. We also consider the case where the resets are asynchronous. We expect these solutions to the “retimed initial state " problem to help increase the practical applicability of retiming. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this note}} we {{consider}} the perfect integrator driven by Poisson process input. We derive its equilibrium and response properties and contrast them to the approximations obtained by applying the diffusion approximation. In particular, the probability density {{in the vicinity of}} the threshold differs, which leads to altered response properties of the system in equilibrium. Stationary solution of perfect integrator with excitation The membrane potential V of the perfect integrator [Tuckwell, 1988] evolves according to the stochastic differential equation dV dt = w i δ(t − ti), where ti are random time points of synaptic impulses events generated by a Poisson process with rate λ and w is the magnitude is the voltage change caused by an incoming event. If V reaches the threshold Vθ the neuron emits an action potential. After the threshold crossing, the voltage is reset to V ← V − (Vθ−Vr). This reset preserves the overshoot above threshold and places the system above the <b>reset</b> <b>value</b> by this amount. Biophysically the reset is motivated by considering each δ-impulse as the limit of a current extended in time. If V crosses Vθ within such a pulse, after the reset to Vr the remainder of the pulse’s charge causes a depolarization starting from Vr. We consider a population of identical neurons and assume a uniformly distributed membrane voltage between reset and threshold initially. In what follows we apply the formalism outlined in Helias et al. [2010]. The first and second infinitesimal moment [Ricciardi et al., 1999] of the diffusion approximation are A 1 = λw def = µ A 2 = λw 2 def = σ 2. The corresponding neuron driven by Gaussian white noise hence obeys the stochastic differ-ential equation dV dt = µ+ σξ(t) ...|$|E
