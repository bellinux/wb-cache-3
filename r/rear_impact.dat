BioRID is more sophisticated in its spinal construction than Hybrid; 24 vertebra simulators allow BioRID to assume a much more natural seating posture, and to demonstrate the neck movement and configuration seen in rear-end collisions.|$|E

25|$|A {{major issue}} in {{whiplash}} prevention {{is the lack of}} proper adjustment of the seat safety system by both drivers and passengers. Studies have shown that a well designed and adjusted head restraint could prevent potentially injurious head-neck kinematics in rear-end collisions by limiting the differential movement of the head and torso. The primary function of a head restraint is to minimize the relative rearward movement {{of the head and neck}} during <b>rear</b> <b>impact.</b> During a rear-end collision, the presence of an effective head restraint behind the occupant’s head can limit the differential movement of the head and torso. A properly placed head restraint where one can sufficiently protect his/her head lower the chances of head injury by up to 35% during a rear-end collision.|$|E

25|$|At Toyota’s Higashi-Fuji Technical Center, the Mirai {{has been}} {{subjected}} to extensive crash testing to evaluate a design specifically intended to address frontal, side and <b>rear</b> <b>impacts</b> and to provide excellent protection of vehicle occupants. A high level of collision safety has also been achieved to help protect the fuel cell stack and high-pressure tanks against body deformation. The high pressure hydrogen tanks have excellent hydrogen permeation prevention performance, strength, and durability. Hydrogen sensors provide warnings and can shut off tank main stop valves. The hydrogen tanks and other hydrogen-related parts are located outside the cabin to ensure that if hydrogen leaks, it will dissipate easily. The vehicle structure is enhanced with carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers from Toray and designed to disperse and absorb impact energy across multiple parts to ensure a high-impact safety performance that protects the Toyota FC Stack and high-pressure hydrogen tanks during frontal, side or <b>rear</b> <b>impacts.</b>|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} non-fatal injuries {{leading to}} disability following motor vehicle collisions. The main {{focus is on}} minor (AIS 1) neck injuries, also called whiplash injuries. The purpose is to describe the distribution of disabilities among car occupants over time and to study the importance of different injury severity assessment levels on the priority ranking of the disability pattern. Another purpose is to study the characteristics and associated risk factors of <b>rear</b> <b>impacts</b> causing short- and long-term consequences to the neck (AIS 1) regarding crash severity and risk of injury in the struck car, in different car models. The materials used in the studies were data from insurance files, police reports and crash recordings of real-life <b>rear</b> <b>impacts</b> where the change of velocity and the crash pulse were measured. It was found that {{during the last two}} decades there has been a change in the distribution of disabilities. Two body regions dominated the change. Injuries to the lower extremities decreased since the 1970 s and AIS 1 neck injuries increased. Furthermore, depending on level of disability, different types of injuries were predominant. For example, head injuries dominated higher disability levels were while for lower disability levels, neck injuries (AIS 1) followed by injuries to the extremities dominated. Concerning risk factors for AIS 1 neck injuries in <b>rear</b> <b>impacts</b> there were differences regarding crash severity parameters for long- and short-term consequences. Earlier {{studies have shown that the}} risk of initial symptoms to the neck are strongly related to the change of velocity. In this study it was found that, given initial symptoms, disability seemed to be more related to the acceleration of the struck car. It was also found that the relative disability risk was higher in cars manufactured at the end of 80 s and beginning of the 90 s than at the beginning of the 80 s. Results from 22 Crash- Pulse-Recorders indicated that the shape of the pulse as well as the peak acceleration vary widely in real-life <b>rear</b> <b>impacts.</b> However, disability can occur when the change of velocity is at least 23 km/h and the peak acceleration 15 g. The principal conclusion is that AIS 1 neck injuries have increased both in proportion and in number and are the dominating injury among non-fatal injuries leading to disability. Better knowledge of risk factors causing disability is needed, especially the influence of crash severity measured as change of velocity and acceleration. This should preferably be evaluated with on-board measurement techniques in real-life collisions. In addition, it is recommended that the prevention of neck injuries in <b>rear</b> <b>impacts</b> should be directed toward the seat characteristics of the car. Also, priorities for intervention should be based on fatalities and injuries causing long-term consequences...|$|R

500|$|The {{design of}} the Pinto fuel system was {{complicated}} by the uncertain regulatory environment during the development period. [...] The first federal standard for automotive fuel system safety, passed in 1967, known as Section 301 in the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards, initially only considered front impacts. [...] In January 1969, 18 months into the Pinto's development cycle, the NHTSA proposed expanding the standard to cover rear-end collisions. [...] The proposed standard {{was based on a}} 20mph moving-barrier <b>rear</b> <b>impact</b> test. Ford publicly announced it supported the standard. In August 1970, the month the Pinto went into production, the NHTSA changed the proposal to a more stringent 20mph fixed-barrier standard which car companies were to meet in 18 months. The fixed-barrier standard was seen by the auto industry as a significant increase in test severity. At the same time the NHTSA announced a long-term goal of setting a 30-mph fixed-barrier standard. [...] Due to the confusion related to the various proposed standards and an expectation that the NHTSA would not select the more stringent 30mph fixed-barrier standard, Ford elected to voluntarily meet the 20mph moving-barrier standard for all cars by 1973. [...] Ford and other automobile manufacturers objected to the more stringent fuel system safety standard and filed objections during the required comment periods of the proposed regulations.|$|E

2500|$|The {{focus of}} {{preventive}} measures {{to date has}} been on the design of car seats, primarily through the introduction of head restraints, often called headrests. This approach is potentially problematic given the underlying assumption that purely mechanical factors cause whiplash injuries — an unproven theory. So far the injury reducing effects of head restraints appears to have been low, approximately 5–10%, because car seats have become stiffer in order to increase crashworthiness [...] of cars in high-speed rear-end collisions which in turn could increase the risk of whiplash injury in low-speed <b>rear</b> <b>impact</b> collisions. Improvements in the geometry of car seats through better design and energy absorption could offer additional benefits.
