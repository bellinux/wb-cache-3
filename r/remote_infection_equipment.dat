40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{exposure}} of joint prostheses to <b>remote</b> <b>infections</b> is unknown. We wanted to estimate (a) the {{exposure of}} arthroplasty patients to severe <b>remote</b> <b>infections,</b> and (b) the incidence of arthroplasty <b>infections</b> associated with <b>remote</b> <b>infections.</b> METHODS: Prospective cohort study of all elective hip and knee arthroplasties performed between March 1996 and September 2008, with retrospective documentation of <b>remote</b> <b>infections</b> in hospitalized patients. RESULTS: A total of 6101 elective total joint arthroplasties, consisting of 4002 hip replacements (66 %) and 2099 knee replacements (34 %), were included. The mean follow-up was 70 months. During the study period, the cohort patients experienced 553 <b>remote</b> <b>infections</b> after a median delay of 33 months post-arthroplasty. There were 71 prosthetic infections detected, 7 (total incidence 7 / 6101, 0. 1 %) of which were secondary to a <b>remote</b> <b>infection.</b> The ratio of <b>infections</b> associated with <b>remote</b> <b>infections</b> to potential exposure was 1 : 79. Among hip arthroplasty patients the incidence rate was 1. 4 <b>infections</b> associated with <b>remote</b> <b>infections</b> per 10, 000 patient-years of follow-up. <b>Infections</b> associated with <b>remote</b> <b>infections</b> occurred later than surgical site infections, (46 months vs. 19 months post-surgery, respectively; mean difference 27 months, 95 % CI 8 - 45 months).

40|$|The {{protective}} immune responses against rubella virus (RV) {{are related}} to its neutralizing epitopes, {{an issue that is}} important to consider when assessing the immune status of patients with <b>remote</b> <b>infection.</b> In the present paper, we compare the antibodies detected by a synthetic-peptide-based enzyme immunoassay (EIA) with antibodies detected by the traditional technique of hemagglutination inhibition (HIA) in patients with <b>remote</b> RV <b>infection.</b> The synthetic peptide used as an antigen (SP 15) represents a neutralizing epitope that corresponds to amino acids 208 to 239 of the E 1 glycoprotein. The SP 15 -EIA was developed, all variables that affected the assay were standardized, and the test was validated using reference sera. Serum samples (n = 129) from patients with <b>remote</b> RV <b>infection</b> were tested by HIA and SP 15 -EIA. Discrepant sera were assayed by MEIA (IMX/Abbot). The comparison between HIA and SP 15 -EIA, taking HIA as the standard methodology for determining immune status, showed that SP 15 -EIA is very specific and sensitive for detecting protecting antibodies (specificity, 100 %; sensitivity, 98. 20 %). This study demonstrates that antibodies against the neutralizing domain represented by SP 15 would be important in the memory response after natural infection and may be a good tool in the determination of the true immune status of patients with <b>remote</b> <b>infection</b> with regard to RV...|$|R

As a result, emergence of resistant organisms is commonplace. Antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery consists of a short antibiotic course given immediately before the procedure {{in order to prevent}} development of a surgical site infection. The basic principle of prophylaxis is to maintain effective concentrations of an antibiotic active against the commonest pathogens during the entire surgery. Materials and methods: We prospectively investigated 427 urologic surgery cases in our department between August 2008 and September 2009 (Group 1). As reference cases, we retrospectively reviewed 966 patients who underwent urologic surgery between May 2004 and May 2008 (Group 2) who were administered antibiotics without any restriction. Prophylactic antibiotics such as cefazolin were administered intravenously according to our protocol. Postoperative body temperature, peripheral white blood cell counts, urinalysis, and urine culture were checked. Results: To judge perioperative infections, wound condition and general condition were evaluated in terms of surgical site infection, as well as <b>remote</b> <b>infection</b> and urinary tract infection, up to postoperative day 30. Surgical site infection was defined as the presence of swelling, tenderness, redness, or drainage of pus from the wound, superficially or deeply. <b>Remote</b> <b>infection</b> was defined as occurrence of pneumonia, sepsis, or urinary tract infection. Perioperative infection rates (for surgical site and <b>remote</b> <b>infection)</b> in Group 1 and Group 2 were nine of 427 (2. 6 %) and 24 of 966 (2. 5 %), respectively. Surgical site infection rates of categories A and B in Group 1 were 0 and two (0. 86 %), respectively, while those in Group 2 were 0 and five (0. 92 %), respectively. There {{was no significant difference in}} infection rates in terms of <b>remote</b> <b>infection</b> and surgical site infection between Group 1 and Group 2 (P = 0. 670). The amounts, as well as the prices, for intravenously administered antibiotics decreased to approximately one quarter. Conclusion: Our protocol effectively decreased the amount of antibiotics used without increasing perioperative infection rates. Thus, our protocol of prophylactic antibiotic therapy can be recommended as an appropriate method for preventing perioperative infection in urologic surgery.

40|$|Background/Aim. Postoperative {{infectious}} complications {{are one of}} {{the most}} important problems in surgical treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC), being present in up to 40 % of patients. The aim of this paper was to establish the significance of serial measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) in serum and matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) in drainage fluid for the detection of infectious complications and anastomotic leakage (AL) in patients with colorectal resection. Methods. CRP and MMP- 9 values in serum and drainage fluid, respectively, were measured on the first, third, fifth, and seventh postoperative day (POD) in 150 patients with colorectal resection and primary anastomosis. The values obtained were compared between the patients without complications and those with surgical site and <b>remote</b> <b>infections</b> and AL. Results. Surgical site infections (SSIs) were observed in 41 (27. 3 %), and <b>remote</b> <b>infections</b> in 10 (6. 7 %) patients. Clinically evident AL was observed in 15 (10 %) patients. In 82 % of the patients with SSIs, serum CRP value on POD 5 exceeded 82 mg/L, with 81 % specificity. AL was reported in 85 % and 92 % of the patients on PODs 5 and 7, respectively, with CRP values of 77 mg/L and 90 mg/L, respectively. The specificity was 77 % for POD 5 and 88 % for POD 7. All the patients with CRP values exceeding 139 mg/L on POD 5 had some of SSIs and/or AL. The mean values of MMP- 9 were not statistically different between the group without complications (n = 99) and the group with AL (n = 15). Conclusion. Serial measurement of CRP is recommended for screening of infectious complications of colorectal resection. Patients with CRP values above 139 mg/L on POD 5 cannot be discharged from hospital, and require an intensive search for infectious complications, particularly AL. MMP- 9 measurement in drainage fluid is not relevant in the detection of AL in patients with colorectal resection...|$|R

In this study, a high throughput method was used to define the frequency of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells specific for four HCMV proteins in the naïve compartment of seronegative subjects and the effector/memory compartments of subjects with primary/remote HCMV infection. The naïve repertoire displayed comparable frequencies of T cells that were reactive with HCMV structural (pp 65, gB and the pentamer gHgLpUL 128 L) and non-structural (IE- 1) proteins. Whereas, following natural infection, the majority of effector/memory CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells recognized either gB or IE- 1, respectively, and pp 65. The pattern of T cell reactivity was comparable at early and late stages of infection and in pregnant women with primary HCMV infection transmitting or not transmitting the virus to the fetus. At {{an early stage of}} primary infection, about 50 % of HCMV-reactive CD 4 + T cells were long-term IL- 7 Rpos memory cells, while 6 - 12 months later, the frequency of these cells increased to 70 %, approaching 100 % in <b>remote</b> <b>infections.</b> In contrast, only 10 - 20 % of HCMV-specific CD 8 + T cells were long-term memory cells up to 12 months after infection onset, thereafter increasing to 70 % in <b>remote</b> <b>infections.</b> Interestingly, a significantly higher frequency of HCMV-specific CD 4 + T cells with a long-term IL- 7 Rpos memory phenotype was observed in non-transmitting compared to transmitting women. These findings indicate that immunodominance in HCMV infection is not predetermined in the naïve compartment, but is the result of virus-host interactions and suggest that prompt control of HCMV infection in pregnancy is associated with the rapid development of long-term IL- 7 Rpos memory HCMV-specific CD 4 + T cells and a low risk of virus transmission to the fetus...|$|R

Two-thirds of infections develop within the acute post-operative period, whereas some infections may develop years or even decades after surgery. Infection rates are higher after breast reconstruction and subsequent implantation than after breast augmentation. Risk factors for infection associated with breast implantation have not been carefully assessed in prospective studies with long-term follow-up. Surgical technique and the patient's underlying condition are the most important determinants. In particular, breast reconstruction after mastectomy and radiotherapy for cancer is associated with a higher risk for infection. The origin of infection in women with implants remains difficult to determine, but potential sources include a contaminated implant, contaminated saline, the surgery itself or the surgical environment, the patient's skin or mammary ducts, or, as suggested by many reports, seeding of the implant from <b>remote</b> <b>infection</b> sites.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{incidence}} of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in the Netherlands shows a seasonal trend, with a peak {{in spring and}} a trough in autumn. Possible causes of this peak are winter crowding and a seasonal decrease in immune competence in spring. A third explanation may be a reporting bias. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of winter crowding by a time-series analysis of notification data. DNA fingerprinting clustering status can differentiate between recent and <b>remote</b> <b>infections.</b> Seasonality in clustered cases would reflect enhanced transmission in winter and/or seasonally lowered immunity, while seasonality in unique cases would only reflect seasonally lowered immunity. METHODS: We fitted (seasonal) auto-regressive moving average models to culture-positive TB notifications in the Netherlands (1993 – 2008) to assess seasonality. We then used seasonal trend Loess decompositions to derive the seasonal pattern, and compared the heights of the seasonal peaks. RESULTS: Clustered and unique EPTB notifications showed a seasonal trend that was absent in clustered and unique PTB notifications. The seasonal peak in clustered EPTB cases was not significantly higher than in unique EPTB cases. CONCLUSIONS: The similar timing and height of the seasonal peak of clustered and unique EPTB cases suggests that winter crowding is unlikely to cause the seasonal trend in notifications...|$|R

In this paper, the authors review the objectives and design of molecular epidemiologic studies of tuberculosis, describe current analytical ap-proaches, and consider the impact of these different approaches on study results. Using data from a previously published investigation of the epidemiology of tuberculosis conducted from 1990 to 1993 among tuberculosis patients in New York City, New York, the authors show how selecting different measures of disease frequency, comparison groups, and sampling strategies may impact the results and interpretability of the study. They demonstrate ways to conduct sensitivity analyses of estimated results and suggest strategies that may improve the usefulness of this approach to studying tuberculosis.

40|$|Young {{chickens}} were inoculated with 5, 000 PFU {{of eastern}} equine encephalitis (EEE) virus and bled at intervals thereafter for determinations of hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI), neutralizing (N), immunoglobulin M (IgM), and IgG antibodies. HI, N, and IgM antibodies were first detected 4 days after infection, and IgG was detected 7 days after infection. All four antibodies persisted through day 90 after infection. HI, N, and IgM antibody titers remained elevated {{and were not}} cross-reactive with the related alphavirus western equine encephalitis (WEE) virus. IgG antibody titers also remained high, but heterologous reactivity to WEE virus increased with time after infection. Serum samples from sentinel chickens and wild birds infected in nature with EEE, WEE, or St. Louis encephalitis virus and submitted to this laboratory from state and local health departments were tested for IgM antibody by using anti-chicken IgM for capture and for IgG antibodies to the EEE and WEE viruses. There was essentially complete correlation between HI, N, and either IgM (indicating recent infections) or IgG (indicating more <b>remote</b> <b>infections)</b> antibody. We conclude that the IgM antibody capture enzyme immunoassay {{can be used as}} a specific and sensitive assay to replace the routinely used HI test for detecting antibody in sentinel chickens and in young, wild birds used for arbovirus surveillance. The test is rapid and relatively inexpensive and can be performed in essentially all adequately supplied laboratories...|$|R

However, asthma severity and location of airway obstruction have not been compared between asthmatic patients with and without evidence for <b>remote</b> mycoplasma <b>infection.</b> Objectives: The aim {{of this research was}} to study the relationship between previous M. pneumoniae infections in asthmatic patients and presence of any predilection for the involvement of central or peripheral airways, the severity of the disease, and asthma control. Methods: Sixty-two patients with asthma were assessed by a validated asthma control test (ACT). All patients underwent spirometry and lung volume studies by body plethysmography. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), residual volume (RV), and functional residual capacity (FRC) were measured. An oropharyngeal swab was obtained for polymerase chain reaction analysis to detect the mycoplasma antigen. Moreover, blood samples were obtained to measure the titration of antimycoplasma immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG antibodies. The asthmatic patients with a positive IgG for mycoplasma and negative PCR and negative IgM antibody were considered to have remote history of mycoplasma infection. The relationship between the asthma control using ACT score and pulmonary function variables were compared in patients with and without evidence for <b>remote</b> mycoplasma <b>infection.</b> Results: The incidence of postnasal drip was higher among the patients with asthma who had no evidence for <b>remote</b> mycoplasma <b>infection</b> (61. 3 % vs 32 %, P = 0. 035). The median ACT score was 16. 5 (11 &ndash; 22) and 20 (13. 75 &ndash; 24) in patients with and without <b>remote</b> M. pneumoniae <b>infection,</b> respectively (P &gt; 0. 05). In addition, the medians of the predicted values of the pulmonary function test parameters (FEV 1, FEV 1 /FVC, FRC, FRC/TLC, RV/TLC, maximal mean expiratory flow 25 %&ndash; 75 %, forced expiratory flow [FEF] 50 %, and FEF 75 %) and actual values of 5 Hz and 20 Hz resistance were not different between asthmatic patients with and without evidence of mycoplasma infection (P &gt; 0. 05). Conclusions: The present study revealed that the asthma control status and parameters of lung function tests did not differ between asthmatic patients with and without evidence of chronic M. pneumoniae infection. The latter indicates the similar location of airway obstruction and comparable severity of asthma between the two groups.

40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is the causative {{agent of}} {{infectious}} mononucleosis, {{and it may}} also be found {{in a wide variety of}} benign and malignant lesions including oral hairy leukoplakia, inflammatory pseudotumor, Hodgkin’s disease, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric carcinoma. Molecular testing is increasingly important in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients affected by these diseases. In biopsy tissues, molecular detection of EBV-encoded RNA transcripts by in situ hybridization remains the gold standard for proving that a histopathological lesion is EBV-related. EBV-encoded RNA hybridization and EBV LMP 1 immunostains are used routinely to detect latent EBV in tissues affected by posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) or in enlarged nodes from patients with infectious mononucleosis. Traditional serology is the best test for evaluating acute versus <b>remote</b> <b>infection</b> in healthy individuals. High serological titers serve as a tumor marker for some EBV-related malignancies, but titers are not a dependable tumor marker in immunocompromised hosts. EBV viral load testing by quantitative DNA amplification of blood samples is a promising new laboratory test that has proven useful for early diagnosis and monitoring patients with PTLD. Recent studies suggest a role for EBV viral load testing in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkin’s disease, and AIDS patients with brain lymphoma. Further research is needed to define more fully the clinical utility of viral load tests in the full spectrum of EBV-associated diseases. Gene expression profiling is on the horizon as a means to improve subclassification of EBV-related diseases and to predict response to therapy...|$|R
40|$|We studied {{two large}} Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} genotype clusters associated with recent outbreaks in homeless persons to determine {{factors associated with}} these tuberculosis (TB) strains. Isolates from all culture-positive TB cases diagnosed from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2004 were genotyped. Patients whose isolates had identical {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} patterns and spoligotypes were considered clustered. Health department records were reviewed and reinterviews attempted for clustered cases. Patients with the Cs 30 and BEs 75 strains were compared to other genotypically clustered cases and to each other. The two largest genotype clusters among homeless persons were the Cs 30 strain (n = 105) and the BEs 75 strain (n = 47). Fifty-one (49 %) patients with the Cs 30 strain and 28 (60 %) with the BEs 75 strain were homeless. Compared to patients with the BEs 75 strain, patients with the Cs 30 strain {{were less likely to be}} respiratory acid-fast bacillus smear positive (51 % versus 72 %). Furthermore, patients with the BEs 75 strain were more likely to be HIV infected (74 % versus 42 %), which suggests that most patients with this strain advanced to disease after recent infection. Cases in clusters of strains that have been circulating in the community over a long time period, such as the Cs 30 strain, require additional investigation to determine whether clustering is a result of recent transmission or reactivation of <b>remote</b> <b>infection...</b>|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Although the {{usefulness}} of antimicrobial prophylaxis for clean-contaminated surgery has been recognized, only a few randomized controlled studies on the duration of administration after hepatectomy have been performed. We investigated the duration of antimicrobial prophylaxis after hepatectomy. Methods: The subjects were 180 patients who underwent hepatectomy without reconstruction of the biliary or intestinal tract between April 2003 and March 2006 at our department. The patients were ran-domly allocated to groups {{to be treated with}} flomoxef sodium as antimicrobial prophylaxis for 2 days (89 patients) or 5 days (91 patients), including the operation day. The presence or absence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and infections was investigated. Results: No significant differences were noted in patient background between the two groups. Infections occurred in seven and six patients in the 2 day and 5 day treatment groups (7. 9 % and 6. 6 %), respectively, showing {{no significant difference between the}} two groups. No significant difference was noted when the cases were divided into surgical site <b>infections</b> and <b>remote</b> <b>infections.</b> The positive rate of SIRS was significantly higher in the 2 day treatment group than in the 5 day treatment group on days 2 and 3 after surgery. The risk factors in patients who developed infections were blood loss, oper-ation time and the complication of biliary fistula. Conclusions: Two day administration of flomoxef sodium may be sufficient for antimicrobial prophy-laxis after hepatectomy. However, when SIRS is positive on post-operative day 2, and induction of liver failure is of concern, it may be safer to continue antimicrobial drug administration until SIRS is eliminated...|$|R
