50|$|Some tractor {{operators}} {{have raised}} concerns about using ROPS in low-clearance environments, such as in orchards and buildings. In response, NIOSH developed an Automatically Deploying <b>Rollover</b> <b>Protective</b> <b>Structure</b> (AutoROPS) which stays in a lowered position until a rollover condition is determined, at which time it deploys to a fully extended and locked position. It is currently working with manufacturers to streamline the commercialization of this technology. The Division of Safety Research branch of NIOSH has developed cost-effective rollover protection structures (CROPS) for four tractor models (Ford 8N, Ford 3000, Ford 4000, Massey Ferguson 135), {{in an effort to}} provide safety for older model tractors.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes {{the use of}} the multibody {{approach}} to evaluate the severity of the injuries to the driver associated with rollover of an agricultural tractor.

The structure of the tractor was considered to be unbendable, whereas i) infinitely rigid, ii) clay-based and iii) sand-based soils have been studied. The obtained results highlight the important role played by the seat belt in confining the farm operator within the safety volume maintained by the <b>rollover</b> <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> (ROPS) of the tractor so that the injuries are reduced. The deformation of the soil produces lower acceleration and velocity values than those obtained with a rigid soil.

40|$|Confusion and misconceptions {{regarding}} the utility {{and safety of}} turf work trucks are addressed in this paper. Sources of this confusion include media stories of related vehicles and advertisements. The maneuverability, including both turning ability and traction performance, as well as lateral-stability characteristics of three- and four-wheeled turf work trucks are evaluated based on experimental tests and mathematical models. Experiments with the three most popular heavy-duty turf work trucks from Cushman ® and Toro® show that the three-wheeled model maintains a distinct advantage over the four-wheeled models with respect to maneuverability in tight spaces as measured in clearance-circle tests. Traction-performance tests with these vehicles show there to be considerable variations in traction performance between vehicles, test conditions, and loading states. The analyses of the lateral-stability characteristics of three- and four-wheeled turf work trucks, using a mathematical model, indicate that the optimum four-wheeled vehicle is more laterally stable than the three wheeler for equal track widths. However, among vehicles of equal clearance-circle performance, the optimum three-wheeled vehicle stability surpasses that of the four wheeler. This paper continues with {{the analysis of the}} effects of a simple load on three- and four-wheeled vehicle stability which shows qualitatively different effects of loading on the two vehicle configurations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Tractor rollovers are a {{major cause}} of farm {{injuries}} and fatalities. The authors used data from a statewide surveillance study to estimate the prevalence of safety features such as rollover protective structures, seat belts, and power take-off shields on farm tractors in Kentucky. METHODS: Using data from the Farm Family Health and Hazard Surveillance Project, the authors report on the prevalence of farm tractor safety features by size of farm, by region of the state, by number of tractors per farm, and by tractor age and estimate the prevalence of tractors equipped with rollover protection by region and for the state as a whole. RESULTS: Of the estimated 85, 446 family-owned farms in Kentucky with at least one tractor, an estimated 55. 6 %, or 47, 515 farms, do not have a tractor equipped with a <b>rollover</b> <b>protective</b> <b>structure.</b> Few tractors that are 10 years old or older were found to be equipped with seat belts; no tractors that were more than 20 years old were equipped with seat belts.

40|$|Aims: Increasing the {{percentage}} of <b>rollover</b> <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> (ROPS) equipped tractors {{has been the focus}} of many agricultural safety campaigns. Traditionally efforts have attempted to persuade farmers through education or community awareness interventions. These efforts have lead to marginal change. In response, a social marketing approach was tested as a means for increasing interest in ROPS retrofitting in New York. Methods: An initial phone survey was conducted with a random sample of New York farmers to identify a potential target population. Following target selection, in-depth interviews were conducted to isolate barriers and motivators to retrofitting. This information was used to develop message prototypes which were tested in small focus group discussions. Selected and revised messages, as well as various other incentives developed in response to feedback from interviews, were then tested in a prospective, quasi-randomized controlled trial. Results: Small crop and livestock farms were selected as the intervention target since they represent 86 % of New York farms with none or only one ROPS protected tractor. Barriers to retrofitting which were identified in interviews were: 1) constant exposures normalize risk, 2) risk is modeled by significant others and 3) safety in general and retrofitting in particular requires too much time and money. The piloting of ROPS incentives led to a marked increase in ROPS sales in New York.

40|$|Rollover {{protective}} structures {{play a vital}} role in protecting the operators of large earthmoving machines which are commonly used in the rural and mining sectors. These structures typically consist of a moment resisting steel frame that is required to withstand the impact forces sustained by the vehicle during a rollover and provide a survival space for the operator during such an event. Recent advances in analytical modelling techniques have made it possible to model accurately the response behaviour of these types of structures when subjected to load and energy requirements according to current performance standards adopted both in Australia and internationally. This paper is concerned with the response behaviour of a <b>rollover</b> <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> (ROPS) fitted to a 125 tonne rigid frame dump truck. Destructive experimental testing which involved the application of static loads to simulate the impact forces created during a rollover has been conducted on a ½ scale model ROPS for this particular vehicle.

In addition to this, non-linear finite element analysis has also been performed on this ROPS using the FEA software package ABAQUS version 6. 3. The first stage of this computer analysis involved subjecting the ROPS to static loads about the lateral, vertical and longitudinal axes of the ROPS and comparing, results with those obtained from the experimental investigation and calibrating the computer model. Further research will involve using the calibrated finite element models to carry out dynamic simulations incorporating energy absorbing devices in the ROPS to optimize the level of energy absorption and enhance performance and operator safety...|$|E
40|$|There are {{approximately}} 4. 2 million tractors on farms and ranches across the United States. The {{average age of}} tractors is over 25 years {{and some of the}} oldest models are the most popular. Older tractors are less safe than newer tractors, and many older tractors are operated by individuals with increased risk of being injured or killed on a tractor. A key tractor safety device, a <b>rollover</b> <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> (ROPS), is missing from most tractors manufactured before 1985. Data from the US Department of Labor's Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) suggest that the production agriculture sector accounts for approximately 70. 3 % of the 3299 work deaths in the Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing industry between 2003 and 2007. Nearly 900 of these incidents involve farm tractors and of these, approximately 43 % were from tractor overturns. Efforts to reduce both the number of tractor overturn fatalities and injuries have been underway for years. These efforts primarily encompass worker education/training programs and activities, ROPS design and engineering applications, and research on more effective ways of encouraging tractor owners to retrofit their older tractors with ROPS.

While this problem is indeed a large rock protruding through the water, it is worthwhile to begin to explore what other rocks lay below the surface so that effective strategies can be developed to address them as the water level drops. Myers has collected and presented data on the ages of tractors and whether or not they were ROPS equipped. In 1975, OSHA promulgated rules requiring ROPS on agricultural tractors. In 1985, ASAE S 318. 10 was introduced to require ROPS on all tractors for the first time. It would seem, therefore, reasonable to assume that all tractors placed in service since 1985 are ROPS equipped. However, a review of the Myers data shows that this is not the case. For tractors in service for 0 to 4 years, only 93. 8 % are reported to be ROPS equipped. For tractors in service for 5 to 9 years, only 92. 8 % are reported to have a ROPS.

40|$|Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Injuries {{to people}} {{living and working}} on farms in New South Wales {{continue}} to be a significant burden on the health system, Workers’ Compensation system, agricultural industries and farming families. Strategies to reduce the number and severity of injuries suffered by farmers and people working on farms rely on accurate information. Unfortunately there is no one dataset available to describe the circumstances surrounding farm injuries and the size of this burden in Australia. Hence, a number of different data sources are required to provide a picture of farm injuries. To date, there has been very little critical examination of what value each of these datasets provides to describing farm injuries. This Thesis aimed to: •	Undertake surveillance of injuries occurring to people on farms or during agricultural production in NSW using data from an Emergency Department, NSW Hospital Separations information, NSW Workers’ Compensation Claims, and ABS Deaths data. •	Critically examine the utility of Emergency Department, Hospital, Workers’ Compensation, and ABS Deaths Data for the surveillance of farm injuries in NSW. •	Critically examine data classification systems used in Emergency Department, Hospital, Workers’ Compensation, and ABS Deaths data collections to describe the breadth of farm injuries in NSW. •	Define the priority areas for farm injury prevention initiatives in NSW based on the information obtained from the examination of the data from Emergency Department, Hospital, Workers’ Compensation, and ABS Deaths. •	Evaluate the effectiveness of the NSW <b>Rollover</b> <b>Protective</b> <b>Structure</b> (ROPS) rebate scheme and examine the utility of the data currently available in NSW to measure the performance of the program. Four datasets, Tamworth Emergency Department, Hospital Separations, Workers’ Compensation and the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Deaths data were used to provide information on the surveillance of farm injuries, describe the breadth of classifications used to describe farm injuries, and define priorities for the prevention of farm injuries. There were 384 farm-related injuries which presented to the Emergency Department at the Tamworth Base Hospital between 1 September 1997 and 31 August 1998. Emergency Department data collected in this study used the Farm Injury Optimal Dataset (FIOD) for classification, which allowed for a comprehensive picture of the circumstances surrounding the injury event. The three most common external causes of injury were related to horses, motorcycles, and animals. Commonly people were working at the time of injury. Children represented 21...|$|E
40|$|The agriculture, forestry, {{and fishing}} (AgFF) {{industry}} sector {{has had the}} highest rate of work-related deaths over the past several years. Tractors are the single largest source of occupational fatalities in this industry sector, and tractor rollovers are the largest category of tractor fatalities. The risk of death due to tractor rollovers {{has been found to be}} reduced considerably when rollover protective structures (ROPS) are used in conjunction with seatbelts. Increasing the number of tractors with ROPS and seatbelts is one way in which tractor rollover fatalities can be mitigated. The NIOSH cost-effective <b>rollover</b> <b>protective</b> <b>structure</b> (CROPS) project was designed as a demonstration project to determine if CROPS, a type of ROPS, could be retrofitted in the field and were acceptable to farmers. To this end, the CROPS project was successful, with 50 tractors being retrofitted with CROPS in the field. All study participants were asked to complete a pretest, test, and posttest regarding the CROPS retrofit demonstration and their knowledge and attitudes toward ROPS. CROPS demonstrators were the participants who retrofitted their tractors with CROPS. Demonstrators were asked to recruit three to five other participants, known as observers, to watch the demonstration. The rationale was to generate interest in ROPS/CROPS among other farmers and community leaders. Overall, 16 % of the participants had youth operating tractors on their farms. Participants reported that 44 youth operated tractors on their farms, more than 25 % of these young tractor operators were 4 to 10 years old, and half of the youth operating tractors on participant farms were 13 years old or younger. Only one participant group (demonstrators) included individuals who had all of their tractors protected with ROPS/CROPS for young tractor operators (28 %), but they accounted for only one farm each among the New York and Virginia demonstrators. The survey question on ROPS importance did not show an overall increase after respondents participated in the CROPS demonstration project. However, one Virginia observer asked to become a Virginia demonstrator and installed a CROPS on his tractor. Additionally, the questions on attitude toward ROPS showed a general increase in mean scores, with the some of the lowest response categories on the follow-up survey not being selected by respondents, indicating a potentially positive impact on participants' safety attitudes toward ROPS. For the safety attitude questions, the majority remained the same. This study indicates there is still much work to be done to reduce the number of deaths in production agriculture due to tractor rollovers. CROPS could be a valuable addition to the efforts of retrofitting ROPS on tractors in order to reduce the number of deaths due to tractor rollovers.

40|$|Action Learning is a {{problem-solving}} {{process that}} is used in various industries to address difficult problems. This project applied Action Learning to a leading problem in agricultural safety. Tractor overturns are {{the leading cause of}} fatal injury to farmworkers. This cause of injury is preventable using <b>rollover</b> <b>protective</b> <b>structures</b> (ROPS), <b>protective</b> equipment that functions as a roll bar structure to protect the operator {{in the event of an}} overturn. For agricultural tractors manufactured after 1976 and employee operated, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation requires employers to equip them with ROPS and seat belts. By the mid- 1980 s, US tractor manufacturers began adding ROPS on all farm tractors over 20 horsepower sold in the United States ([URL] However, many older tractors remain in use without ROPS, putting tractor operators at continued risk for traumatic injury and fatality. For many older tractor models ROPS are available for retrofit, but for a variety of reasons, tractor owners have not chosen to retrofit those ROPS. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) attempted various means to ameliorate this occupational safety risk, including the manufacture of a low-cost ROPS for self-assembly. Other approaches address barriers to adoption. An Action Learning approach to increasing adoption of ROPS was followed in Virginia and New York, with mixed results. Virginia took action to increase the manufacturing and adoption of ROPS, but New York saw problems that would be insurmountable. Increased focus on team composition might be needed to establish effective Action Learning teams to address this problem.

30|$|Energy {{crisis and}} {{environmental}} concerns place higher requirement {{to decrease the}} weight of vehicles and achieve a highest possible safety and quality with minimum cost. In the last few decades, {{there has been a}} continuous focus on design optimization as a primary requirement in the design of automotive structures. Lightweight materials, such as aluminum and magnesium alloys, are gradually finding their place in vehicle engineering (Miller et al. 2000). Thin-walled structures are widely used to dissipate the vehicle’s kinetic energy in terms of plastic deformation in collisions. Many applications employ thin-walled tubes to enhance the crashworthiness of structure such as energy absorption devices at the front of cars and trains (Marsolek & Reimerdes 2002), aircraft sub floor <b>structures</b> (Bisagni), and <b>rollover</b> <b>protective</b> <b>structures</b> (ROPS) of heavy vehicles, such as bulldozers and tractors (Ahmad & Thambiratnam 2009 a). Thin-walled tubes with different geometries and materials are commonly used to absorb kinetic energy through plastic material deformation. The widespread use of thin-walled tubes as energy absorbers is due to their good performance under dynamic loading, availability, low manufacturing cost, and efficiency. Numerous efforts {{have been made in the}} past decades to improve the crashworthiness performance of the crush absorber tubes, such as foam filled tubes (Hanssen et al. 2000; Ahmad & Thambiratnam 2009 b; 2009 c; Aktay et al. 2008; Mirfendereski et al. 2008), introducing different patterns (Zhang et al. 2007), grooves (Zhang & Huh 2009; Saleh ghaffari et al. 2010), multi-cells (Zhang & Zhang 2013; Zhang & Zhang 2014), and functionally graded structures (Mohammadiha & Ghariblu 2016; Sun et al. 2010). Relative merits of conical tubes with graded thickness subjected to oblique impact loads are investigated by Zhang (Zhang & Zahng 2015).|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} chores when {{farmers were}} either fatally or seriously injured and required {{emergency medical treatment}} {{as a result of}} overturns of tractors with or without <b>rollover</b> <b>protective</b> <b>structures</b> (ROPS). Data from the 2002 Kentucky Farm Tractor Overturn Survey were used for this study. The data were collected by a telephone survey of a population-based random sample of 6063 (7. 98 %) of Kentucky’s 76, 017 farm operators as listed in the Kentucky Agricultural Statistics Service database. Of farm operators interviewed, 551 (9. 1 %) reported 603 overturns and 5512 (90. 9 %) reported no overturns in the history of their farm, covering a period from 1925 to February 2002. Only the latest overturn was considered to improve recall accuracy. In addition, since the 1925 to 1959 time period had only 49 (8. 1 %) of the overturns reported, (14 farmers did not provide the year of most recent overturn); only data from the 1960 to 2002 period (approximately 41 years) were used. After making these adjustments, incidents evaluated included 25 cases (one fatal and four serious nonfatal injuries) that involved ROPS-equipped tractor overturns and 88 cases (24 fatal and 64 serious nonfatal injuries) that involved non-ROPS tractor overturns. Chores at highest risk for tractor overturns were identified for which educational and ROPS retrofit interventions could be emphasized. The highest frequency of overturn-related fatalities and nonfatal injuries were associated with hay harvesting, rotary mowing, and on-farm travel chores. These three chores represented 68. 2 % of fatal events and 50. 0 % of permanent and 56. 6 % of temporary disability overturn incidents. Tragically, in countries such as India and China with emerging mechanization, a large majority of tractors are produced without ROPS that can be expected to result in the same overturn-related epidemic of deaths experienced in highly mechanized countries, despite evidence of the protection provided by ROPS...|$|R
