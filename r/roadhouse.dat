5|$|Following his {{unsuccessful}} run for {{the governorship}} in 1987, Brown resumed {{his career in the}} restaurant industry. He started the Chicken Grill restaurant in Louisville and helped his wife, Phyllis, launch Chicken By George, a line of boneless, skinless chicken breast products designed for sale in supermarkets and preparation at home. In 1988, Hormel made Chicken By George one of its subsidiaries. Brown expanded several other restaurants including Miami Subs, Texas <b>Roadhouse,</b> and <b>Roadhouse</b> Grill. None of these ventures matched the success he experienced early in his career.|$|E
50|$|Many <b>roadhouses,</b> some 37 in alland some now {{listed on}} the National Register of Historic Places, were built along this trail for the {{convenience}} of travelers.

Most <b>roadhouses</b> are located along highways or roads in rural areas or {{on the outskirts of}} towns. Early <b>roadhouses</b> provided lodging for travelers but, with the advent of faster means of transport than walking, horseback riding, or horse-drawn carriages, few now offer rooms to let. <b>Roadhouses</b> have a slightly disreputable image, similar to honky tonks.|$|R

5|$|The <b>roadhouse</b> {{is named}} after Rika Wallen, who {{acquired}} it from John Hajdukovich and operated it for many years. It became a hub of activity in that region of the interior. With {{the construction of the}} ALCAN (now Alaska) Highway and the replacement of the ferry with a bridge downstream, traffic moved away and patronage declined. The <b>roadhouse</b> was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and is now a centerpiece of Big Delta State Historical Park, also listed on the National Register.|$|E
5|$|With {{the coming}} of the war and {{construction}} of the ALCAN Highway, which connected to the Richardson south of Big Delta, road traffic waned further. The ferry crossing was replaced by a wooden bridge, and later, a larger steel bridge was constructed downriver. This caused rerouting of the highway away from the <b>roadhouse,</b> drawing off traffic and travelers. Wallen operated the <b>roadhouse</b> through the 1940s and early 1950s, although in later years guests were by invitation only. John Hajdukovich died in 1965, and Rika Wallen died four years later in 1969.|$|E
5|$|A {{trading post}} was {{constructed}} {{on the south}} bank of the Tanana, at Bates Landing in April 1904 by a prospector named Ben Bennett on his claim of , but Bennett sold the post and land to Daniel G. McCarty in April 1905. However since E.T. Barnette, the founder of Fairbanks, and McCarty's former employer, had financed the goods in the post, Barnette retained ownership of them. The post property, now {{being used as a}} <b>roadhouse,</b> soon became known as McCarty's. Another prospector named Alonzo Maxey, and a friend, built Bradley's <b>Roadhouse</b> to compete with McCarty's and by 1907, McCarty's had been transferred to Maxey.|$|E

5|$|Overall, Great Northern Highway {{performs}} favourably {{in terms}} of road safety, compared to other major highways in Western Australia. Whilst making up {{two thirds of the}} state's National Highway network, it was the location of only half of all recorded fatalities for 2005–2009. For that period, the sections of the highway from Wubin to the Sandfire <b>Roadhouse,</b> north-east of Port Hedland, were considered by the Australian Automobile Association to be among the lowest risk highway links in the state. However, the section from Perth to Wubin was rated as medium risk, and the northern sections of the highway were rated medium-high and high risk. In 2013, Great Northern Highway received a similar rating, still higher overall than the other highways. Out of five stars, 21% was rated as one- or two-star, and 79% was rated three- or four-star, with the southern and northern ends of the highway generally less safe than the portion from Wubin to the Sandfire <b>Roadhouse.</b>|$|E
5|$|Retail {{stores such as}} Wal-Mart and Lowe's {{serve the}} {{population}} with jobs and basic needs. The Chambersburg Mall with four anchor stores and about fifty smaller stores {{is located in the}} unincorporated village of Scotland, about four miles (6km) north of town on Interstate 81. Chambersburg's retail sector has grown quickly since 2006 with the opening of Target, Petsmart, Michaels, and Kohls near the newly built Exit 17 of Interstate 81. Several restaurants new to the region have also opened, including Sonic, Starbucks, T.G.I. Fridays, Red Robin, Fuddruckers, Ruby Tuesday, Panera Bread, Chipotle, Texas <b>Roadhouse,</b> Olive Garden, and Longhorn Steakhouse.|$|E
5|$|Outraged by his wife's escapades and the mayor's {{threat of}} {{personal}} violence, Wormer organizes a kangaroo court and revokes Delta's charter. To take their minds off this action, Otter, Boon, Flounder, and Pinto go {{on a road}} trip. Otter is successful in picking up four young women from Emily Dickinson College as dates {{for himself and his}} Delta brothers. He elicits sympathy by posing as the fiancé of a young woman at the college who died in a recent kiln explosion. They stop at a <b>roadhouse</b> bar where Day's band is performing, not realizing it has an exclusively African-American clientele. A couple of hulking patrons intimidate the Deltas and they quickly exit, smashing up Flounder's borrowed car and leaving their dates behind.|$|E

5|$|Wealthier {{women with}} capital might invest in mines and other businesses. One {{of the most}} {{prominent}} businesswomen in the Klondike, was Belinda Mulrooney. She brought a consignment of cloth and hot water bottles with her when she arrived in the Klondike in early 1897 and with the proceeds of those sales she first built a <b>roadhouse</b> at Grand Forks and later a grand hotel in Dawson. She invested widely, including acquiring her own mining company, and was reputed to be the richest woman of the Klondike. The wealthy Martha Black was abandoned by her husband early in the journey to the Klondike, but continued on without him, reaching Dawson City where she became a prominent citizen, investing in various mining and business ventures with her brother.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{interviews}} Hurley about a {{video of}} Laura and Donna Hayward (Lara Flynn Boyle); Hayward had denied him being present {{the day it was}} taken but Cooper notices a reflection of his motorcycle in the video. Cooper confronts Hurley about the affair he was having with Palmer, and about her cocaine habit. Hurley admits seeing Palmer the night she died but denies killing her. James' uncle Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) comes to the sheriff's department to pick his nephew up. Ed tells Truman that he was drugged the previous night at The <b>Roadhouse,</b> the town's bar; he suspects bartender Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) was responsible. Cooper takes a telephone call from his colleague Albert Rosenfield, who {{is on his way to}} aid the investigation. Meanwhile, Briggs and his friend Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger) are in a jail cell, discussing money they owe to Leo. The $10,000 they were meant to pay him is in a safe deposit box owned by Palmer, which they can now no longer access. They are later released by Cooper, who warns them not to approach James Hurley.|$|E
5|$|Desperate to {{save his}} brother, Dean sells his soul to a Crossroads Demon (Ona Grauer) in {{exchange}} for Sam's resurrection, and is given only one year before collection is due. They later conduct research at Bobby's home, hoping to determine Azazel's plan. Ellen Harvelle (Samantha Ferris), owner of the now-destroyed <b>Roadhouse,</b> then arrives, and is forced to drink holy water to prove {{that she is not}} possessed by a demon. After giving them a map of Wyoming that Ash had left in the Roadhouse's safe, she points out five X's that have been marked, representing frontier churches built by Samuel Colt—hunter and creator of the mystical Colt, a gun capable of killing anything. Research also shows that railway lines connect all the churches {{in the form of a}} pentagram, creating a giant devil's trap that demons cannot enter.|$|E

5|$|Ilona turned south, {{and later}} south-southeast, on 15December {{and began a}} steady {{approach}} to Western Australia. Slight intensification took place, with the cyclone achieving its peak strength around 00:00UTC on 17December with ten-minute sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph) and a barometric pressure of 960hPa (mbar; 28.35inHg). The JTWC estimated Ilona to be slightly stronger, with maximum one-minute sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph)—a Category2-equivalent on the SSHS. That day, Ilona passed near the North Rankin gas platform. Around 16:00UTC, the eye of Ilona made landfall near Mardie Station. Around 16:30UTC, the center of Ilona passed over the town, with a five minute period of calm observed. An eye passage was also reported in Fortescue <b>Roadhouse.</b> The cyclone rapidly decayed as it accelerated inland, falling below tropical cyclone strength by 00:00UTC on 19December, at which time it was situated northeast of Meekatharra. Thereafter, the decaying low turned east and ultimately dissipated later that day {{just west of the}} Western Australia–South Australia border.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} the {{impending}} cyclone halted local industries such as oil production and iron ore mining and exporting. The Port of Port Hedland, a highly important iron ore shipping terminal, was forced to close for about 52 hours, contributing to inflated iron ore prices and delayed shipments. Multiple companies suspended work at oil fields and mines throughout the region, cutting national oil production by 25% and iron ore exports by 4.7% versus the previous month. Overall, Lua is attributed to $217million (2012 AUD; $230million 2012 USD) in lost revenue. Lua produced strong winds and widespread rainfall on land, but damage was limited {{by the lack of}} population in the storm's path. The Pardoo <b>Roadhouse</b> bore the brunt of the storm, and damage was reported at several other cattle stations and homesteads; at these sites, the storm damaged the exteriors of various structures and brought down swaths of trees. Central Western Australia endured several days of record-breaking rainfall and cool weather. The Government of Western Australia provided disaster relief funds to the hardest-hit areas, and Lua was later retired from the list of tropical cyclone names.|$|E
5|$|Great Northern Highway {{travels to}} remote areas of Western Australia, {{including}} the Munjina <b>Roadhouse</b> near the Hamersley Ranges, and {{the communities of}} Eighty Mile Beach, Wallal, Sandfire and Mandora, which are located between Broome and Port Hedland. It is the only sealed road between the Northern Territory border and major population centres {{in the north of}} the state. Economically, Great Northern Highway is also a vital link in the resource rich regions of the Wheatbelt, Mid West, Pilbara, and Kimberley. The key industries of mining, agriculture, and pastoral stations are all dependent on the highway as a significant and in some cases only method of transport. Tourism accounts for {{a significant portion of the}} road's traffic, and is a growing part of or potential growth source for the regional economies. The highway provides access to a variety of tourist attractions, including New Norcia, the Yilgarn area, and various national parks, including Karijini. Parts of the highway itself are included in the tourist routes Swan Valley Tourist Drive (Tourist Drive203) in Perth, Chittering Valley Tourist Way (Tourist Drive359) in Bullsbrook, Midlands Tourist Way (Tourist Drive360) from Upper Swan to Walebing, and Geikie–Windjana Tourist Way (Tourist Drive350) from Geikie Gorge National Park to Fitzroy Crossing.|$|E
