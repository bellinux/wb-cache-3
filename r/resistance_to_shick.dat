40|$|Little {{has been}} done {{to address the issue of}} how <b>to</b> {{overcome}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change in a change effort in the church world. “How <b>to</b> overcome <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change?” is a question that requires serious consideration among church leaders. Church leaders continue to act in ways that produce <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and ultimately failed change efforts. These actions on the part of church leaders often strengthen and reinforce the sources of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, making it very difficult for change to be accepted by church members. A literature study design was used to conduct this research. The purpose of this research was to: • Understand the phenomenon of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change • To determine the actions of leaders that generate <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change • To determine how church leaders can overcome <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change The research indicates that church leaders make too many errors in a change process that generates <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. The research has found eight actions of leaders that generates <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change by followers. Apart from the eight actions of leaders that produce <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, many change agents continue to function as managers and not leaders in a change process. This results in further <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. The research clearly shows that for church leaders <b>to</b> effectively overcome <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, they need to follow a multi-stage change process, which is comprehensive, sequential and one that develops naturally and addresses all the sources of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. The research shows that church leaders should not skip or race through the steps or fail to reinforce earlier steps in the process of overcoming <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. The researcher recommends nine steps that can be used by church leaders <b>to</b> overcome <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and thus facilitate change successfully. Dr. B. J. Geyse...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2000. The {{management}} of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change by school principals of secondary {{schools in the}} North-West Province was investigated in this study. Changes are continually occurring on all levels of a rapidly developing society, and resistance is an inseparable part of this process. Since the school stands {{in the center of}} the developing community, the school principal, as education manager, should have a firm knowledge of skills which will enable him to efficiently implement the {{management of}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. Examples of large-scale changes that occurred in education during the past five years are the implementation of Curriculum 2005 and the transformation of Model C schools. The aim of this research centered on the following problems: What is the nature of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change? What does the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change encompass? To what extent and in which way do school principals manage <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change? Firstly a literature study was undertaken to ascertain the nature of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, as well as methods and models according <b>to</b> which <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change can be managed. Findings from the literature study points to a number of aspects of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change which plays a decisive role in the management of change. These include factors giving rise <b>to</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, types of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, manifestations of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and reaction phases of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. The way in which <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change is managed is influenced by, among others, factors indicating whether or not the school is ready for change, techniques which can be employed in the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change, and also existing models which can be used successfully to facilitate the management process of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. Secondly an empirical investigation was undertaken to investigate the degree and way in which school principals manage <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change. For this purpose a structured questionnaire as well as a semi-structured interview schedule was used. Findings from the empirical interview revealed that in general school principals handled the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change better than what was initially surmised, although few of them had enough relevant knowledge to be considered specialists in this field. Recommendations ensuing from this study comprise the inclusion of a module in educational management courses specifically aimed at change, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change and especially the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change with the view to better equip education managers, the development of a refined model for the management of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> change in schools, and also further research into such management model(s) to ascertain the practical application or its relevance in practice.

40|$|The {{genetics}} of Striga {{resistance in}} sorghum {{has not been}} clearly demonstrated. Expression of field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Striga appears to be quantitative suggesting the involvement of quantitative trait loci (QTL). However, many of these loci including the one responsible {{for the production of}} low germination stimulant (lgs) have not been mapped. The objectives of this study were to (i) construct a molecular map of the sorghum genome and to map the (lgs) gene, (ii) estimate heritability and response <b>to</b> selection of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> these two Striga species (iii) estimate genetic correlation between field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> these two Striga species (iv) identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) involved in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> two species of Striga in sorghum (v) compare the efficiency of predicted response to marker-based selection (MBS) and marker-assisted (MAS) selection relative to phenotypic selection for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> Striga. A sorghum linkage map based on one 168 RI lines and 236 molecular marker loci was constructed. The population was mapped using RAPDs, RFLPs, I-SSR and SSR markers. The estimated map size was 1628 cM, with an average interval of 9. 5 cM between adjacent loci. The lgs gene mapped 11. 8 cM from RFLP marker PI 0200725. Narrow sense heritability (h 2) of field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. asiatica was estimated at 0. 35 and that of <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. hermonthica at 0. 24. Predicted response <b>to</b> selection for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the two Striga species was the same. Significant genetic correlation (0. 52) was found between <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. hermonthica and S. asiatica. Single marker analysis linking field <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> marker data detected six QTL for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. hermonthica and five QTLs for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. asiatica. QTL detected for resistance accounted for 37 % of the variation in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. hermonthica and 49 % of the variation in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> S. asiatica.

Genes for high-level <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> streptomycin (str) and spectinomycin (spc) and for low-level <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> tetracycline (tet) and chloramphenicol (chl) were linked. Also, a locus for high-level <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> rifampin (rif) {{was linked to}} str and tet. The apparent order was rif [...] . str [...] . tet [...] . chl [...] . spc. Loci for <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> other antibiotics (penicillin, erythromycin) were transferred independently {{of each other and}} were not linked to the cluster around str. Similar linkage relationships were found with str, tet, chl, and spc loci obtained from naturally occurring (clinical) isolates of N. gonorrhoeae...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} standard insecticide susceptibility testing across western Kenya {{and found}} that the Anopheles gambiae mosquito has acquired high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> pyrethroids and DDT, patchy <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> carbamates, but no <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> organophosphates. Use of non-pyrethroid-based vector control tools may be preferable for malaria prevention in this region. 26583525 PMC 467241...|$|R
