40|$|Abstract — Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{is known}} to lead to marked {{alterations}} in cortical-basal ganglia activity that may be amenable {{to serve as a}} biomarker for PD diagnosis. Using non-linear delay differential equations (DDE) for classification of PD patients on and off dopaminergic therapy (PD-on, PD-off, respectively) from healthy age-matched controls (CO), we show that 1 second of quasi-resting state clean and <b>raw</b> electroencephalogram (<b>EEG)</b> data can be used to classify CO from PD-on/off based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AROC). <b>Raw</b> <b>EEG</b> is shown to classify more robustly (AROC= 0. 59 - 0. 86) than clean EEG data (AROC= 0. 57 - 0. 72). Decomposition of the raw data into stereotypical and non-stereotypical artifacts provides evidence that increased classification of <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> time series originates from muscle artifacts. Thus, non-linear feature extraction and classification of <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> data in a low dimensional feature space is a potential biomarker for Parkinson’s disease. I...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Amplitude-integrated {{electroencephalography}} (aEEG) is {{a useful}} tool to determine the severity of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Our aim {{was to assess the}} prevalence and study the origin of false normal aEEG recordings based on 85 aEEG recordings registered before six hours of age. METHODS: <b>Raw</b> <b>EEG</b> recordings were reevaluated retrospectively with Fourier analysis to identify and describe the frequency patterns of the <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> signal, in cases with inconsistent aEEG recordings and clinical symptoms. Power spectral density curves, power (P) and median frequency (MF) were determined using the <b>raw</b> <b>EEG.</b> In 7 patients non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (NDMR) exposure was found. The EEG sections were analyzed and compared before and after NDMR administration. RESULTS: The reevaluation found that the aEEG was truly normal in 4 neonates. In 3 neonates, high voltage electrocardiographic (ECG) artifacts were found with flat trace on <b>raw</b> <b>EEG.</b> High frequency component (HFC) was found as a cause of normal appearing aEEG in 10 neonates. HFC disappeared while P and MF decreased significantly upon NDMR administration in each observed case. CONCLUSION: Occurrence of false normal aEEG background pattern is relatively high in neonates with HIE and hypothermia. High frequency EEG artifacts suggestive of shivering were found to be {{the most common cause of}} false normal aEEG in hypothermic neonates while high voltage ECG artifacts are less common...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the sensitivity of}} quantitative EEG (QEEG) for electrographic seizure identification {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU). Methods: Six-hour EEG epochs chosen from 15 patients underwent transformation into QEEG displays. Each epoch was reviewed in 3 formats: <b>raw</b> <b>EEG,</b> QEEG + <b>raw,</b> and QEEG-only. Epochs were also analyzed by a proprietary seizure detection algorithm. Nine neurophysiologists reviewed <b>raw</b> <b>EEGs</b> to identify seizures to serve as the gold standard. Nine other neurophysiologists with experience in QEEG evaluated the epochs in QEEG formats, with and without concomitant <b>raw</b> <b>EEG.</b> Sensitivity and false-positive rates (FPRs) for seizure identification were calculated and median review time assessed. Results: Mean sensitivity for seizure identification ranged from 51 % to 67 % for QEEG-only and 63 %- 68 %for QEEG + raw. FPRs averaged 1 /h for QEEG-only and 0. 5 /h for QEEG + raw. Mean sensitivity of seizure probability software was 26. 2 %- 26. 7 %, with FPR of 0. 07 /h. Epochs with the highest sensitivities contained frequent, intermittent seizures. Lower sensitivities were seen with slow-frequency, low-amplitude seizures and epochs with rhythmic or periodic patterns. Median review times were shorter for QEEG (6 minutes) and QEEG + raw analysis (14. 5 minutes) vs <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> (19 minutes; p = 0. 00003). Conclusions: A panel of QEEG trends can be used by experts to shorten EEG reviewtime for seizure identification with reasonable sensitivity and low FPRs. The prevalence of false detections confirms that <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> review must be used in conjunction with QEEG. Studies are needed to identify optimal QEEG trend configurations and the utility of QEEG as a screening tool for non-EEG personnel. Classification of evidence review: This study provides Class II evidence that QEEG + raw interpreted by experts identifies seizures in patients in the ICU with a sensitivity of 63 %- 68 % and FPR of 0. 5 seizures per hour.

This paper presents an alternative neural information processing architecture using the Schrödinger wave equation (SWE) for enhancement of the <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> signal. The <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> signal obtained during the motor imagery (MI) of a BCI user is intrinsically embedded with non-Gaussian noise while the actual signal is still a mystery. The proposed work in the field of recurrent quantum neural network (RQNN) is designed to filter such non-Gaussian noise using an unsupervised learning scheme without making any assumption about the signal type. The proposed learning architecture has been modified {{to do away with the}} Hebbian learning associated with the existing RQNN architecture as this learning scheme was found to be unstable for complex signals such as EEG. Besides, this the soliton behaviour of the non-linear SWE was not properly preserved in the existing scheme. The unsupervised learning algorithm proposed in this paper is able to efficiently capture the statistical behaviour of the input signal while making the algorithm robust to parametric sensitivity. This denoised EEG signal is then fed as an input to the feature extractor to obtain the Hjorth features. These features are then used to train a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier.

Methods: 177 Two-channel EEG recordings 3 – 6 h long were collected from 26 infants born before 29 weeks of gestation. The <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> was converted into four different continuous measures of ppA: amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG), range-EEG (rEEG), Gotman and Gloor’s half-wave decomposition (HWD), and root of mean squares (RMS).

40|$|Brain-computer {{interface}} (BCI) technology {{provides a}} means of communication that allows individuals with severely impaired movement to communicate with assistive devices using the electroencephalogram (EEG) or other brain signals. Dealing with the unknown embedded noise within the <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> and the inherent lower bandwidth of BCI are still two of the major challenges in making BC! practical for day-to-day use. The <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> signal recorded non-invasively during motor i ~~~y (MI) is intrinsically ". " embedded with non-Gaussian noise while the actual noise-free EEG has {{so far not been}} attained. Therefore, a filtering approach is needed to remove noise. A novel quantum mechanics motivated alternative neural information processing architecture using the Schrodinger wave equation (SWE) is proposed to filter and thereby enhance the information from the otherwise noisy EEG signals. This novel filtering approach is constructed using a layer of neurons within the neural network framework, referred to as the Recurrent Quantum Neural Network (RQNN) that recurrently computes a time-varying probability density function (pdf) for the measurement of the observed signal. The <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> sample is encoded in terms of a particle-like wave packet {{that can be used to}} accurately filter noise from the EEG using an unsupervised learning scheme without making any assumption about the underlying distribution. The RQNN enhanced EEG signal is more easily classified than the raw signal. Another major challenge in two-class BC! systems is also addressed in this thesis, namely the inherent lower bandwidth of the communication channel that may lead to a sluggish response in suitably controlling a mobile robotic device. An intelligent and adaptive user interface, which plays a very important role as a front-end display for the BCI user is proposed. The framework of the proposed intelligent Adaptive User Interface (iAUI) i. e., the brain-robot interface is consistent for a range of applications e. g., for controlling either a mobile robot or a robotic arm. The iAUI for mobile robot offers a real-time prioritized list of all the options for selection by the user. Prioritized update ofthe iAUI is possible by utilizing information obtained from the sonar sensors mounted on the mobile robot. Through iAUI the user is always offered the most likely choice, thereby improving the information transfer rate. Similarly, the interface for controlling the robot arm displays the list of available objects for user selection depending on the real-time information from the camera view of the robot arm. Results on multiple participants show that both the main contributions, the RQNN filtering and the iAUI address to a large extent the issues of dealing with unknown embedded noise within the <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> and the inherent lower bandwidth of BCI. xv AbstractEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

METHODS: One hour qEEG panels (n = 180) were collected retrospectively from 45 ICU patients and were distributed to 5 neurophysiologists, 7 EEG technologists, and 5 Neuroscience ICU nurses for evaluation of seizures. Each panel consisted of the following qEEG tools, displayed separately for left and right hemisphere electrodes: rhythmicity spectrogram (rhythmic run detection and display; Persyst Inc), color density spectral array, EEG asymmetry index, and amplitude integrated EEG.

Anaesthetists, however, do not usually observe the <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> data: they generally pay attention only to the Bispectral Index (BIS™) and other indices calculated by EEGmonitors. This abstracted information only partially characterizes EEG features. To properly appreciate the availability and reliability of EEG-derived indices, {{it is necessary to}} understand how <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> changes during anaesthesia. With hemi-frontal lead EEGs obtained under volatile anaesthesia or propofol anaesthesia, the dominant EEG frequency decreases and the amplitude increases with increasing concentrations of anaesthetic. Looking more closely, the EEG changes aremore complicated. At surgical concentrations of anaesthesia, spindlewaves (alpha range) become dominant. At deeper levels, this activity decreases, and theta and delta waves predominate. At even deeper levels, EEG waveform changes into a burst and suppression pattern, and finally becomes flat. EEG waveforms vary in the presence of noxious stimuli (surgical skin incision), which is not always reflected in BIS™, or other processed EEG indices. Spindle waves are adequately sensitive, however, to noxious stimuli: under surgical anaesthesia they disappear when noxious stimuli are applied, and reappear when adequate analgesia is obtained.

This is achieved by applying the cleaning method to <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> data. Then, a synchrony measure is applied on the raw and the clean data in order to compare the improvement of the classification rate. Two classifiers are used, linear discriminant analysis and neural networks. For both cases, the classification rate is improved about 20 %...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} thesis explores {{an efficient}} communication approach in P 300 based single trial brain-computer interface (BCI). As {{a tool of}} rehabilitation engineering for the locked-in patients, the BCI {{is expected to be}} swift in performance and intelligent in recognition. With this aim, the objectives of this thesis are to reduce noise from <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> signals using novel variants of principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD), to improve classification performance using Fuzzy ARTMAP, Simplified Fuzzy ARTMAP and a combination of other linear classifier and to reduce feature dimension and hardware requirement using genetic algorithm (GA) ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{families}} (stateful and stateless) {{of genetically}} programmed classifiers were tested on a five class brain computer interface (BCI) data set of <b>raw</b> <b>EEG</b> signals. The ability of evolved classifiers to discriminate mental tasks {{from each other}} were analysed in terms of accuracy, precision and recall. A model describing the dynamics of state usage in stateful programs is introduced. An investigation of relationships between the model attributes and associated classification results was made. The results show that both stateful and stateless programs can be successfully evolved for this task, though stateful programs start from lower fitness and take longer to evolve...|$|R
