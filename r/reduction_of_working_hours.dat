During {{the last two}} decades, working time became more {{flexible}} and heterogeneous. Working hours of full-time employees in the EU hardly changed. The strong increase in part-time work was the outstanding phenomenon. Today, one third of female employees and almost ten percent of male employees work part-time. In a period of slow growth, productivity gains will be squeezed by subdued investment and low capacity utilisation.

40|$|The <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> {{standard}} weekly <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> {{from the}} curreilt leveI of 44 hours to 40 hours {{has recently been}} proposed by the main central unions {{as a way to}} create jobs and reduce unemployment in Brazil. The idea, known as work-sharing, is that the reduction in average hours per worker allows the same tasks to be performed bymore employees. However, the notion ofwork-sharing has been challenged by the theoretical and the empirical literature. Theory says that, in general, a reduction in the duration ofthe workweek tends to decrease employment. Work-sharing is even less likely in the case of no wage restraint, when monthly wages are not proportionally reduced. Recent cautious econometric evidence also conflict with the notion of work -sharing (Hunt, 1999, and Crépon and Kramarz, 2000). The objective ofthis paper is to study the effects ofthe workweek length reduction from 48 to 44 hours, prescribed by the 1988 Constitutional change, on the Brazilian labor market. We find that: i) the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> standard <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> was followed by a significant decrease in actual working hours: 60, 7 % ofthe employees that worked between 45 and 48 weekly hours in 1988 (the affected group) and that remained employed in 1989 switched to a 40 - 44 hours workweek; ii) belonging to the affected group in 1988 had no statistical effect on the probability ofbecoming unemployed, exiting the labor market, or switching to an informal job in 1989; iii) the reduction in <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> implied a 8, 8 % increase in hourly real wages with respect to those that remained employed at 40 - 44 hours a week. In sum, the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> standard <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> in 1988 reduced actual <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> did not affect the probability ofa typical worker to lose hisjob in 1989, and implied a relative increase in hourly real wages...|$|R

30|$|The second aspect {{has to do}} {{with other}} {{additional}} institutional factors which allowed a higher flexibility in Germany. In 2009, the overall <b>working</b> time <b>of</b> dependent employees was reduced by 41.3 hours (3.1 %) on average compared to the previous year (Fuchs et al. 2010). Basically, three instruments of working-time flexibility at the firm level (working-time accounts, working overtime and the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> weekly <b>working</b> <b>hours)</b> and one instrument at the state level (short-time work) involving subsidies from the FEA made this adjustment in <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> possible (Dietz et al. 2011). The first instrument at the firm level consisted of working-time accounts, which made it possible for firms to adjust the number of hours worked depending on the business cycle. During economic upswings, employees had accumulated <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> in their accounts through unpaid overtime, which they then used up with free time during the economic downturn. As a second instrument, paid working overtime was reduced by almost 20 % {{in the first quarter of}} 2009 (Dietz et al. 2011). The last instrument at the firm level, <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> weekly <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> had recently been made more flexible due to new collective agreements, most of which were made in the manufacturing sector. The greatest <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> average weekly full-time <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> was in the first quarter of 2009, with an average decrease of roughly one hour compared to the previous year (Dietz et al. 2011). Finally, short-time work (STW) was expanded dramatically during the Great Recession. In May 2009, around 1.5 million workers were drawing benefits from the STW scheme compared to 50, 000 in September 2008, the month of the Lehmann insolvency (Statistik der Bundesagentur für Arbeit 2012). The main idea behind STW is to offer an alternative to firms to lower labor costs without having to lay off workers. At the moment there are three kinds of STW, out of which the so-called “STW for economic reasons” (§ 96, SCB III) has mainly been applied during the economic crisis. A firm is eligible for this type of STW if it is able to claim that it suffers a temporary and inevitable loss or stoppage <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> due to an aggravation of business conditions because of economic reasons. This stoppage must result in a loss of wages of more than 10 % of the monthly gross earnings of at least one third of the firm’s employees. Furthermore, the firm must have already applied all other possible flexibility options (i.e. <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> overtime hours and the use of working-time accounts). Then for each worker, the FEA then pays the firm up to 67 % of the individual net wage gap resulting from the loss <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> for up to 24 months (Crimman and Wießner, 2009). Taking the average number <b>of</b> subsidized <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> into account, STW supposedly saved around 360, 000 jobs (Möller 2010). In summary, the greatest contribution to the overall <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the annual <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> in 2009 compared to 2008 was 13 % and resulted from STW. The <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> weekly <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> contributed to the overall reduction with a share of roughly 10 %, whereas the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> paid overtime was almost 8 %. Finally, working-time accounts were responsible for 7 % <b>of</b> the overall <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> the yearly <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> (Fuchs et al. 2010).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three empirical essays {{within the field of}} labour economics. As a whole, it explores the (un) intended consequences of labour regulation, with each chapter providing an independent analytical contribution to a specific aspect of the field. Chapter 1 analyzes the effect <b>of</b> a <b>reduction</b> in standard <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> on employment tran- sitions. In this chapter, I study Chile's <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> weekly <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> from 48 to 45, which was announced in 2001 but implemented in 2005. This policy was innovative, compared with those in other countries, because it isolated the reduction in <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> from other policy changes, such as working time flexibility and financial incentives to firms. Thus, this policy is an interesting example for other countries to study, especially those without the scale capacity to provide such incentives, as it allows them to identify its effects on employment. Our results, which are confirmed by several robustness checks, suggest that despite the pre-announcement of the policy, firms displayed non-anticipatory behaviour on key variables. Furthermore, we find that firms waited to implement the reduction in <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> until just before the deadline. Overall, we find that a reduction in standard hours had no significant effects on employment transitions, although we do find a significant e¤ect on hourly wages (i. e., wage compensation). Chapter 2 extends the analysis of Chapter 1 to health outcomes. This is important, as the health effects <b>of</b> <b>reductions</b> in <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> have not been addressed by the existing literature; instead, most of the empirical evidence concerns employment outcomes, family life balance, and social networks. Using panel data from France and Portugal, this chapter exploits the exogenous variation <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> coming from labour regulation and estimates its impact on health outcomes. In this way, our contribution to the existing literature is threefold: first, this is the first evaluation of health outcomes of policies that reduce <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> Second, we avoid the problem of endogeneity with health outcomes by using exogenous <b>reductions</b> <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours.</b> Third, as the effects on health might depend on the level <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> our analysis is performed for two different countries with differing weekly hour thresholds (France, 35 hours; Portugal, 40 hours). Our results suggest a non-monotonic relationship between weekly <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> and health outcomes. In particular, a negative (positive) effect is found for young men (women) in France, and no e¤ect is found in Portugal. Chapter 3 (coauthored by Eugenio Rojas and Mauricio Villena) examines childcare policies and analyzes who effectively pays for childcare when it is not publicly funded. This is interesting, since in several countries governments provide and fund childcare, but in many others it is privately funded, as labour regulation mandates that firms have to provide childcare services. For this latter case, there is no empirical evidence on the effects generated by the financial burden of childcare provision. In particular, there is no evidence about who effectively pays for childcare (i. e., firms or employees) and how it is paid for (i. e., via wages and/or employment). Our study is the first one to provide empirical evidence on the effects generated by the finan- cial burden of childcare provision. For this, we exploit a Chilean labour regulation requiring that firms with 20 or more female workers provide and fund childcare for their workers. Our hypothesis is that, in imperfect labour markets (e. g., oligopsonistic), firms will pass childcare costs on to their workers. To analyze this, we exploit a discontinuity in the childcare provision mandated by the Chilean Labour Code. Our results suggest that firms pass almost the entire childcare cost (nearly 90...|$|R

Results show that the employment level always improves as the length <b>of</b> the <b>working</b> week is reduced but also reveal an inflection point in terms of the productivity <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours,</b> below which a reduction in the number <b>of</b> <b>working</b> <b>hours</b> improves the results of macroeconomic variables and above which this policy aggravates the economic situation. ...|$|R
