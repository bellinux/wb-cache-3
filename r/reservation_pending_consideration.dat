40|$|Background Skin {{diseases}} are very common and {{can have a}} large impact {{on the quality of}} life of patients and caregivers. This programme addressed four diseases: (1) eczema, (2) vitiligo, (3) squamous cell skin cancer (SCC) and (4) pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). Objective To set priorities and reduce uncertainties for the treatment and prevention of skin disease in our four chosen diseases. Design Mixed methods including eight systematic reviews, three prioritisation exercises, two pilot randomised controlled trials (RCTs), three feasibility studies, two core outcome initiatives, four funding proposals for national RCTs and one completed national RCT. Setting Secondary care, primary care and the general population. Participants Patients (and their caregivers) with eczema, vitiligo, SCC and PG, plus health-care professionals with an interest in skin disease. Interventions Our three intervention studies included (1) barrier enhancement using emollients from birth to prevent eczema (pilot RCT); (2) handheld narrowband ultraviolet light B therapy for treating vitiligo (pilot RCT); and (3) oral ciclosporin (Neoral®, Novartis Pharmaceuticals) compared with oral prednisolone for managing PG (pragmatic national RCT). Results Systematic reviews included two overarching systematic reviews of RCTs of treatments for eczema and vitiligo, an umbrella review of systematic reviews of interventions for the prevention of eczema, two reviews of treatments for SCC (one included RCTs and the second included observational studies), and three reviews of outcome measures and outcome reporting. Three prioritisation partnership exercises identified 26 priority areas for future research in eczema, vitiligo and SCC. Two international consensus initiatives identified four core domains for future eczema trials and seven core domains for vitiligo trials. Two pilot RCTs and three feasibility studies critically informed development of four trial proposals for external funding, three of which are now funded and one is <b>pending</b> <b>consideration</b> by funders. Our pragmatic RCT tested the two commonly used systemic treatments for PG (prednisolone vs. ciclosporin) and found no difference in their clinical effectiveness or cost-effectiveness.

5000|$|Once the {{decisions}} of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Kitchen v. Herbert and Bishop v. Oklahoma became binding precedent on federal courts in Kansas, the ACLU filed a lawsuit, Marie v. Moser, in U.S. district court on October 10 on behalf of two lesbian couples who had been refused marriage licenses since the Supreme Court declined to review those decisions. The suit named as defendants Robert Moser, Secretary of the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE), and two district court clerks. Judge Daniel D. Crabtree heard oral arguments on October 31. On November 4, he ruled that [...] "because Kansas’ constitution and statutes indeed do what Kitchen forbids, the Court concludes that Kansas’ same-sex marriage ban violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution". He stayed enforcement of his ruling against state officials until 5 pm on November 11 unless the state defendants inform the court before then that they will not appeal the decision. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the state's request for a stay pending appeal. The Westboro Baptist Church has sought to intervene in the suit without success. Anticipating the expiration of Judge Crabtree's temporary stay, Chief Judge Wayne Lampson of the state district court in Wyandotte County ordered his court's clerks to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples beginning November 12. The state defendants asked Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, as Circuit Justice for the Tenth Circuit, to issue a stay pending appeal, and on November 10 she granted a temporary stay <b>pending</b> <b>consideration</b> of their request. In their briefs, the parties disputed the significance of the order issued by the Kansas Supreme Court in State v. Moriarty and of the recent decision of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in DeBoer v. Snyder. The Supreme Court denied the state's request for a stay on November 12, 2014, allowing the district court order to take effect.

40|$|For many prisoners, federal {{habeas corpus}} {{stands as the}} last {{opportunity}} to challenge the constitutionality of their convictions or sentences. Simply navigating through the procedural maze of habeas practice, however, is a formidable task for inmates proceeding pro se and prisoners represented by counsel. Tragically, those {{who have had a}} fundamentally unfair trial, and even those who are innocent, may easily stumble. Since 1867, habeas corpus, or the Great Writ, has been available to state prisoners 2 ̆ 2 in all cases where any person may be restrained of his or her liberty in violation of the constitution, or of any treaty or law of the United States. 2 ̆ 2 The modern era of federal habeas corpus, however, did not begin until the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Brown v. Allen. In Brown, the Court held that the violation of a constitutional right is cognizable in federal habeas and that federal courts may independently review state court adjudications of federal questions, even if the state court 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of those legal claims was full and fair. The potential scope of habeas corpus is vast. At its root is the principle that 2 ̆ 2 if the imprisonment cannot be shown to conform with the fundamental requirements of law, the individual is entitled to his immediate release.... Vindication of due process is precisely its historic office. 2 ̆ 2 However, despite the expansive tone of much of the language describing habeas corpus, its effective reach has been curtailed, especially in recent years. Motivated by concerns for the finality of convictions and federalism, 2 ̆ 2 the Court has erected 2 ̆ 2 a Byzantine morass of arbitrary, unnecessary, and unjustifiable impediments to the vindication of federal rights. 2 ̆ 2 The Court has even downplayed the role of habeas corpus itself. Congress may act to restrict habeas even further. To assist state inmates who confront the difficult task of a federal court challenge to the legality of their detention, we first outline the elementary steps in habeas corpus procedure. Next, we outline the State 2 ̆ 7 s possible defenses. We then examine doctrines that affect the way a federal court treats the merits of claims presented in the petition. Finally, we address the special concerns of death-sentenced inmates who seek a stay of execution <b>pending</b> <b>consideration</b> of their habeas petitions. While an understanding of complex habeas corpus principles is important, it is perhaps secondary to the art of meaningful habeas corpus advocacy. The practitioner must convince the court that the inmate is a human being, not a remorseless criminal; that the inmate was denied a fundamentally fair trial and is not merely raising technical issues; and finally, that the inmate, rather than refusing to accept responsibility for misdeeds, did not receive basic justice in the state court...|$|R
30|$|While {{the current}} {{standard}} approach of adjusting for non-response is acceptable and valid in all countries with high participation rates, the current adjustment methods {{can be improved}} {{by the use of}} nonresponse questionnaires to lower the risk of bias. Therefore, school nonresponse questionnaires may be applied in future studies in countries experiencing low participation rates in past assessments or that foresee such problems. We believe that high response rates could be achieved for such questionnaires, because the burden of completing them is considerably lower compared to a full study participation of the school. However, great care is needed to develop procedures on how to administer these questionnaires, ensuring that the participation in the actual survey is not jeopardized. Methodological and financial considerations will determine whether a standard approach (one standardized questionnaire for all affected countries) or a tailored approach (country-specific questionnaires) is more efficient. Further investigations are needed to show whether the presented approach of developing nonresponse questionnaires is also applicable to other large-scale assessments and if nonresponse questionnaires for individuals could be developed in similar ways. Moreover, a study on the feasibility of the practical application is <b>pending.</b> Careful <b>consideration</b> is needed to optimally integrate the administration of such questionnaires in the tight schedule of large-scale assessments. High participation rates would be needed to ensure the usability of this instrument. In this sense, short questionnaires might be favorable, while another option would be to administer full school questionnaires. The latter would simplify data processing and operations, but also be beneficial regarding the quality of the nonresponse bias analysis.|$|R
