The <b>rotating</b> <b>filter</b> in a closed housing was found to produce high viscous drag (shear stress) compared to rotating disk.

Seventeen patients underwent 188 treatments. Blood flows to the filter ranged from 75 to 100 ml/min; mean filtration fraction was 64 ± 1 % (± SE, N = 188). Mean plasma removal rate per treatment was 40. 2 ± 0. 6 ml/min; net plasma removed per treatment was 3231 ± 53 ml (N = 188); mean treatment time was 83 ± 2 minutes (N = 188). Mean {{percent decline in}} platelet count was 15 ± 4 % (N = 46). Immunoglobulin kinetics were evaluated in order to validate our method of treatment prescription. The apparent volume of distribution (AVD) for each immunoglobulin class was compared to our estimate for plasma volume (EPV). The fraction AVD/EPV for IgG was 0. 97 ± 0. 04 (N = 14), for IgA was 0. 87 ± 0. 04 (N = 13) and for IgM was 0. 96 ± 0. 3 (N = 26). Use of the EPV allowed for accurate prediction of treatment results. Correlation between expected and actual decline in serum levels revealed an r value of 0. 86 for IgG (P = 0. 0002), 0. 88 for IgA (P = 0. 0001), and 0. 57 for IgM (P < 0. 003).

At gas and liquid cocurrent operation, the toluene elimination capacity of <b>rotating</b> biotrickling <b>filters</b> was 20 % higher than at countercurrent operation.

Performance versus load curves of rotating and of conventional biotrickling filters were comparable with non-zero order removal at toluene inlet concentrations lower than 2 g m- 3.

40|$|Rotating {{cylindrical}} filtration displays {{significantly reduced}} plugging of filter pores and build-up of a cake layer, {{but the number}} and range of parameters that can be adjusted complicates the design of these devices. Twelve individual parameters were investigated experimentally by measuring the build-up of particles on the <b>rotating</b> cylindrical <b>filter</b> after a fixed time of operation. The build-up of particles on the filter depends on the rotational speed, the radial filtrate flow, the particle size and the gap width. Other parameters, such as suspension concentration and total flow rate are less important. Of the four mechanisms present in <b>rotating</b> <b>filters</b> to reduce pore plugging and cake build-up, axial shear, rotational shear, centrifugal sedimentation and vortical motion, the evidence suggests rotational shear is the dominant mechanism, although the other mechanisms still play minor roles. The ratio of the shear force acting parallel to the filter surface on a particle to the Stokes drag acting normal to the filter surface on the particle due {{to the difference between}} particle motion and filtrate flow {{can be used as a}} non-dimensional parameter that predicts the degree of particle build-up on the filter surface for a wide variety of filtration conditions. c 2002 Elsevier Science B.

30|$|The major {{instrument}} {{to be used}} in this study is the meridian scanning photometer (MSP). MSP is an instrument that collects photons of specified wavelengths while scanning a longitudinal meridian. The data used in this study cover three generations of MSPs that are deployed by the Auroral Imaging Group at the University of Calgary. The legacy MSP instrument was operated from 1987 to 2011. After that, MSPs with new electronics and optics were re-deployed and are still working today. These MSPs sample 577.7  nm and 630  nm Oxygen lines, 486.1  nm Hβ proton auroral emissions, 470.9  nm N 2 emission line, and four addition channels for background subtraction, in a time resolution of ~[*] 30  s per scan. The 557.7  nm green-line is chosen as representative of electron auroras in this study. Since those MSPs are designed for multi-wavelength observations, they are equipped with <b>rotating</b> <b>filter</b> wheels. Sample gating reduces the signal, which may be crucial for the weak proton auroral emissions. Forty-eight sixty-one (FESO) was specially designed for proton auroras. It duplicates the scanning pattern and period (30  s) of the refurbished MSP, but is designed to allow simultaneous signal and background measurement without the <b>rotating</b> <b>filter</b> wheel, therefore enhancing sensitivity. The scan steps required for Hβ sampling to accumulate to a reliable signal/noise ratio are reduced for FESO, hence improving the latitudinal resolution. In this study, we shall use FESO data at Athabasca, which has been operating since 2014. All the MSP and FESO data included in this study are preliminarily calibrated. Background subtraction and elevation angle dependence are processed, yet the conversion factors to absolute Rayleigh values have not been finally determined. However, except for occasional noises the relative variations of both electron auroras and proton auroras measured by MSP and FESO, which are the research interest of this study, are trustworthy.|$|E
