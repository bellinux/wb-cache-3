40|$|We {{study the}} {{question}} of how long it takes players to <b>reach</b> <b>a</b> Nash equilibrium in uncoupled setups, where each player initially knows only his own payoff function. We derive lower bounds on the communication complexity of <b>reaching</b> <b>a</b> Nash equilibrium, i. e., on the number of bits that need to be transmitted, and thus also on the required number of steps. Specifically, we show lower bounds that are exponential in the number of players in each one of the following cases: (1) <b>reaching</b> <b>a</b> pure Nash equilibrium; (2) <b>reaching</b> <b>a</b> pure Nash equilibrium in a Bayesian setting; and (3) <b>reaching</b> <b>a</b> mixed Nash equilibrium.
