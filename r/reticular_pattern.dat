40|$|PURPOSE: To analyze choroidal changes {{associated}} with reticular pseudodrusen by indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and enhanced depth imaging spectral-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (EDI SD-OCT). METHODS: Twenty-two consecutive patients (22 eyes) with reticular pseudodrusen, and without medium/large drusen, underwent ICGA and EDI OCT. Twenty-one age- and sex-matched subjects (21 eyes) with early age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and without pseudodrusen, also underwent EDI OCT. RESULTS: Mean age of patients with reticular pseudodrusen and with early AMD was 82. 5 ± 0. 9 and 79. 3 ± 4. 4 years of age, respectively (P = 0. 9), and 59. 0 % and 76. 2 % were females, respectively (P = 0. 7). On ICGA, <b>reticular</b> <b>patterns</b> appeared as hypofluorescent, not overlying the large choroidal vessels. Areas of iso/hyperfluorescence on ICGA, occurring adjacently to <b>reticular</b> <b>patterns,</b> appeared on OCT as subretinal deposits. The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness was significantly reduced in the group with reticular pseudodrusen compared with that {{in the control group}} (174. 6 ± 10. 1 and + 241. 4 ± 16. 5, respectively; P < 0. 001). At all measurement points, but the 3000 μm superior to the fovea, the choroidal thickness of eyes with reticular pseudodrusen appeared thinner than that of the control group. Interestingly, the choroid of eyes with reticular pseudodrusen appeared thicker at 3000 μm superior to the fovea compared with that at all other measurement points. CONCLUSIONS: It was shown that the <b>reticular</b> <b>patterns</b> appeared as hypofluorescent lesions on ICGA, closely abutting, but not overlying the large choroidal vessels.

40|$|Objectives]: To {{evaluate}} dermoscopic {{features in}} a group of 127 patients with mastocytosis in the skin and to investigate the relationship between different dermoscopic patterns and other clinical and biological characteristics of the disease. [Design]: Clinical and laboratory data were compared among patients with mastocytosis grouped according to the different dermoscopic patterns. [Setting]: Patients were selected from the Instituto de Estudios de Mastocitosis de Castilla La Mancha and the Department of Dermatology of Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal from April 1 through September 30, 2009. [Patients]: Overall, 127 consecutive patients (70 females [55. 1 %] and 57 males [44. 9 %]; median age, 17 years; range, 0 - 81 years) with mastocytosis in the skin were included in the study. [Main Outcome Measures]: Evaluation of dermoscopic patterns and investigation of potential predictive factors for more symptomatic forms of the disease according to the need for daily antimediator therapy. [Results]: Four distinct dermoscopic patterns were observed: yellow-orange blot, pigment network, <b>reticular</b> vascular <b>pattern,</b> and (most frequently) light-brown blot. A <b>reticular</b> vascular <b>pattern</b> was identified in all telangiectasia macular eruptiva and some maculopapular mastocytosis. In turn, all patients with mastocytoma displayed the yellow-orange blot <b>pattern.</b> The <b>reticular</b> vascular dermoscopic <b>pattern</b> was associated with the need for daily antimediator therapy; this pattern, together with serum tryptase levels and plaque-type mastocytosis, represented the best combination of independent factors to predict the need for maintained antimediator therapy. [Conclusions]: Dermoscopy is a feasible method for the subclassification of mastocytosis.

A study of pulmonary function {{was carried out}} in 25 patients and compared with that of 46 patients with the interstitial radiological type of sarcoidosis. Twenty-two cases have been followed up from one to six years after the initial examination. The radiographic lesions were most often bilateral and included nodules greater than 15 mm with ill-defined margins or diffuse, infiltrative, non-retractile opacities with fluffy margins. Bilateral mediastinal lymph nodes were present in 27 patients. In 20 patients an associated reticulation was found on radiography. In four patients an open lung biopsy was done. The granulomatous nodules were identical to those found in other forms of sarcoidosis, although they were more confluent in the affected areas. Clinical and functional findings did not differ from those in the more common forms of sarcoidosis. Alveolar sarcoidosis has a sudden course.

40|$|In recent years, {{considerable}} {{research has}} been undertaken {{in order to gain}} a better quantitative understanding of morphometric patterns within modern carbonate depositional systems. The industrial application of the scaling/juxtaposition relationships derived from the Modern to subsurface Cenozoic carbonate reservoirs appears relatively straightforward, given that many key biota are common to both. However, the direct application of Modern sedimentary insight further back into the geologic rock record is more controversial, given the enormous changes in the biota, climate, sea level, water chemistry and so on, that have taken place. To justify such an approach, we contend that similar morphometric patterns should be observed in both the Modern and ancient data. In the Norwegian Barents Sea, numerous seismic surveys have imaged Upper Palaeozoic carbonate buildups arranged in polygonal networks, or <b>reticular</b> <b>patterns.</b> These patterns are observed in both warm water photozoan and cool water heterozoan carbonate stratigraphies, and are developed atop platforms founded on stable shelves, in tectonically active settings and platforms developed over basinal evaporites. GIS mapping of multiple seismic horizons allows the Palaeozoic reticulated morphology to be numerically compared to that mapped in Alacranes Reef from QuickBird satellite imagery. QuickBird 2 ̆ 7 s metre-scale resolution allows identification of subtle cross-platform trends, such as windward-leeward differences in the packing density of ridge-and-pond complexes, which can be correlated with the kilometre-scale patterning extracted in the Barents subsurface. Despite different controls and architecture, the <b>patterning</b> of <b>reticular</b> networks is statistically inseparable between the two systems, once the metre-scale Modern dataset is down-sampled to seismic resolution. Whilst other controls cannot unequivocally be ruled out, these results suggest that biotic self-organisation is a fundamental driver of sedimentary patterns on carbonate platforms. To our knowledge, this is the first quantitative comparison of morphometric patterns from the Modern and Palaeozoic that clearly reveals similar patterns of self-organisation. For the depositional environments considered, the findings suggest that juxtaposition rules, facies proportions and scaling relationships extracted from the Modern can successfully be applied to the ancient...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the problem of {{automatic}} classification of melanocytic lesions, aiming at identifying the presence of <b>reticular</b> <b>patterns.</b> The recognition of reticular lesions is an important step in the description of the pigmented network, in order to obtain meaningful diagnostic information. Parameters like color, size or symmetry could benefit from the knowledge of having a reticular or non-reticular lesion. The detection of network patterns is performed with a three-steps procedure. The first step is the localization of line points, by means of the line points detection algorithm, firstly described by Steger. The second step is the linking of such points into a line considering the direction of the line at its endpoints and the number of line points connected to these. Finally a third step discards the meshes which couldn’t be closed {{at the end of the}} linking procedure and the ones characterized by anomalous values of area or circularity. The number of the valid meshes left and their area with respect to the whole area of the lesion are the inputs of a discriminant function which classifies the lesions into reticular and non-reticular. This approach was tested on two balanced (both sets are formed by 50 reticular and 50 non-reticular images) training and testing sets. We obtained above 86 % correct classification of the reticular and non-reticular lesions on real skin images, with a specificity value never lower than 92 %...|$|R
40|$|Sun {{exposure}} {{has been}} known to cause histological changes in the dermal layer of the skin. Using deterioration in the fine <b>reticular</b> <b>patterning</b> of the epidermal stratum corneum (skin pattern, as measured on the Beagley–Gibson scale) as a proxy measure of histological changes in the dermal layer, previous studies have typically assumed that degradation of skin pattern is largely caused by sun exposure. A twin study comprising 332 monozygotic twin pairs and 488 dizygotic twin pairs at ages 12, 14, and 16 was used to investigate the etiology of variation in skin pattern, particularly in relation to measured sun exposure and skin color. Our results indicate that although self-reported sun exposure is a significant contributor to variation in skin pattern, its effect is small, explaining only 3. 4 % of variation in skin pattern at age 14. Additive genetic effects explain 86 % of variation in skin pattern at age 12 but these effects reduce with age so that 75 % of variation is due to additive genetic effects at age 14 and 72 % at age 16. This trend of diminishing genetic influences continues into adulthood, with 62 % of variation due to non-additive genetic factors in a smaller adult sample (aged 32 – 86). Skin color explains 10. 4 % of variation in skin pattern at age 12, which is due to additive genetic influences common to both. Melanin content appears to provide a protective effect against skin pattern deterioration, perhaps because of the structural differences in melanosomes between different skin types or the free radical scavenging properties of melanin...|$|R
