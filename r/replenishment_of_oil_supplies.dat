30|$|Figure  4 {{reveals a}} {{noticeable}} {{difference in the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates across various quantiles. The sequence of the estimated coefficients can express the structure <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates. Panel A reveals the shock structure <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> on <b>oil</b> exporting countries. The structure of shock tends to be inverse S-shaped. Unlike the median quantile, in the lower and upper quantiles, the estimated coefficient on the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock variables tends to be statistically distinguishable from zero. This implies that for significant US dollar depreciations, the shock is mostly negative, whereas for significant US dollar appreciations it is mostly positive. This pattern is clearly apparent for Canada, Norway and the United Kingdom. However, for Mexico, the shock structure <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> tends to be inverse U-shaped. In both the lower and upper quantiles, the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks have negative and statistically significant impacts on its real exchange rate. The structure <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates in oil-importing countries {{is shown in the}} Panel B. These shock structures tend to be U-shaped in most cases. At the lower quantiles, <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks have positive and statistically significant effects on both Japan and the European Union. However, at the upper quantiles, only for Japan are the <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks positive and statistically significant. Overall, the effects <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on real exchange rates have heterogeneous impacts on different countries and across various quantiles. In particular, for significant US dollar depreciation and appreciation, the impact <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on exchange rates is significantly distinguishable from zero.|$|R

40|$|We use vector autoregressions with {{drifting}} coe ¢ cients and stochastic volatility {{to investigate}} how the dynamic e¤ects <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on the U.

This 8 ̆ 5 nding together with time-varying dynamics helps explain why an <b>oil</b> production shortfall <b>of</b> the same magnitude {{is associated with a}} stronger response <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> prices and more severe macroeconomic consequences over time, while an <b>oil</b> price increase <b>of</b> the same magnitude is associated with a smaller decline in oil production and smaller losses in U.

40|$|Using a Time-Varying Parameters Bayesian Vector Autoregression model, we {{investigate}} how the dynamic effects <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks on the US economy {{have changed over}} time. In contrast to previous studies, we identify <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks with sign restrictions which are derived from a simple supply and demand model <b>of</b> the global <b>oil</b> market. First, we find a remarkable structural change in the oil market itself, i. e. a typical <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shock {{is characterized by a}} much smaller impact on world oil production and a greater effect on the real price <b>of</b> crude <b>oil</b> over time. A steepening <b>of</b> the <b>oil</b> demand curve is the only possible explanation for this stylized fact. Accordingly, similar physical disturbances in oil production now have a significantly higher leverage effect on oil prices resulting in a stronger impact on real GDP and consumer prices. Second, we document that the contribution <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> shocks to fluctuations in the real price <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> has decreased considerably over time, implying that current oil price fluctuations are more demand driven. Third, <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> disturbances seem to have played a significant but non-exclusive role in the 1974 / 75 and early 1990 s recessions but were of minor importance in the 1980 / 81 and millennium slowdowns.

40|$|During the 1980 s and 1990 s, energy {{security}} declined in importance as oil prices fell and spare capacity stood at high levels. This was reversed {{in the decade}} that followed and once more {{energy security}} became a priority in policy agendas of most oil-importing countries. High <b>oil</b> prices, threats <b>of</b> terrorist attacks, instability in many oil-exporting countries and the rise in so-called ‘oil nationalism’ have raised serious concerns about the security <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>supplies.</b> In the background, there are fears that the world may be running out <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> with many observers predicting an imminent <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> crunch (Campbell and Laherrère, 1998) and raising doubts about the size <b>of</b> proven <b>oil</b> reserves in the Middle East and elsewhere (Simmons, 2005).

40|$|Narrative {{reporting}} {{has been}} identified as potentially playing one of two contrasting rather than complementary roles: incremental information (II) and impression management (IM).

From the perspective <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> <b>supply</b> security, how should China portfolio crude oil and petroleum product imports to minimize its oil import risk? Using portfolio theory and a diversification index approach, this paper compares and analyzes the supply, price and transport risks <b>of</b> crude <b>oil</b> and petroleum product imports. Our {{results show that the}} following: (1) Specific risk (diversification risk) and marine transport risk of China's petroleum product imports are lower than that <b>of</b> crude <b>oil</b> imports.

Only an additional response in labor supply can explain this latter fact highlighting the importance of general equilibrium effects in a spatial context.
