40|$|Feed {{efficiency}} in fed F 2 Nellore-Angus steers produced through embryo transfer was evaluated using two methods: residual feed intake (RFI) and NRC-based model predicted residual consumption (MPRC). Sire and family(sire) both contributed {{to differences in}} model predicted residual consumption (P = 0. 036 and P < 0. 001, respectively), but not in RFI (P = 0. 117 and 0. 455, respectively). This indicates that variation exists among the sires and families studied, and the opportunity exists to improve MPRC through selection; it also indicates these 2 evaluation methods could result in different conclusions about feed efficiency. Five aspects of temperament were also evaluated (aggressiveness, nervousness, flightiness, gregariousness, and overall temperament) on a 9 -point scale shortly after weaning. Sire {{had a significant effect}} on all 5 aspects of temperament evaluated, but family was only responsible for variation in aggressiveness, nervousness, and overall temperament. Contemporary group had no effect on aggressiveness, but did contribute significantly to variation in all other temperament traits. All temperament traits were highly correlated with one another (r = 0. 81 to 0. 98). <b>Recipient</b> <b>dam</b> temperament was lowly correlated with gregariousness and overall temperament (r = 0. 16 and 0. 15, respectively), and the correlations with <b>recipient</b> <b>dam</b> temperament approached significance for aggressiveness, nervousness and flightiness. This suggests that the temperament of the recipient female may have a small effect on the temperament of the calf. This population was structured to identify QTL for economically important traits and appears to be useful to identify genetic markers for feed efficiency and animal temperament...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Genetic parameters and non-Mendelian genetic effects were estimated from a data set on Bos taurus-Bos indicus calves produced by embryo transfer. The data set contained records for gestation length (GL), birth weight (BW), weaning weight (@, slaughter weight (SW) and hot carcass weight (HCW) on 590 3 / 4 Angus- 1 / 4 Brahman, 3 / 4 BrahrfianY 4 Angus backcross and F 2 progeny from nine mating strategies and bom in both fall and spring from 1991 and 1996. Data for these five traits were analyzed by single and multiple trait animal models including direct additive and <b>recipient</b> <b>dam</b> (matemal) effects as random effects, cross by gender and year by season as fixed effects and age at weaning, days on feed and age at slaughter as covariates. Variance components and heritabilities were estimated by using the Multiple Trait Derivative-Free Restricted Maximum Likelihood (MTDFRENM) computer program. Heritabilities from single and multiple trait analyses were 0. 34 and 0. 35 for GL, 0. 37 and 0. 37 for BW, 0. 28 and 0. 33 for WW, 0. 58 and 0. 61 for SW and 0. 48 and 0. 57 for HCW, respectively. The portion of variance due to matemal effects from single and multiple trait analyses were 0. 18 and 0. IO for GL, 0. 15 and 0. 12 for BW and 0. 3 5 and 0. 27 for WW, respectively. Heritability estimates from the multiple trait analysis were higher than those from the single trait analyses and the proportion of variance due to matemal effects from the multiple trait analysis were lower than those from single trait analyses. High genetic correlations were estimated among slaughter-hot carcass weight (0. 98), weaning-slaughter weight (0. 90), weaning-hot carcass weight (0. 81) and birth-weaning weight (0. 87). The difference between reciprocal backcrosses was significant for GL, BW, WW, SW and HCW. Potential causes of reciprocal effects for these five traits were estimated using four regression variables associated with the effects of X and Y chromosomes and cytoplasmic inheritance and no effects were detected among 3 / 4 Angus- 1 / 4 Brahman, 3 / 4 Brahman- 1 / 4 Angus and F 2 Bos taurus-Bos indicus calves. Since these data do not support the hypothesis of X or Y-linked inheritance as contributing to observed differences in reciprocal F, crosses, additional investigation will be necessary to explain the origin of differences between reciprocal backcrosses...|$|E
40|$|Influence of <b>recipient</b> <b>dams</b> of {{different}} breeds on performance of Japanese Black calves produced by embryo transfer To clarify {{the effect of}} breed of <b>recipient</b> <b>dams</b> {{on the performance of}} calves produced by embryo transfer(ET), a total of 35 ET-calves were divided into 4 groups by the breed of <b>recipient</b> of Holstein-Friesian <b>dams</b> (HF), crossbred (HolsteinÃ—Japanese Black) dams (F 1), Japanese Black dams (JB) and also JB dams without colostrum but received an artificial colostrum as a negative control (NC). Twenty calves produced by artificial insemination to JB dams were also provided as a positive control (PC). Calves in JB, HF, F 1 and PC were placed with their dams for the first 7 days of age. Those in the NC group were kept in an individual pen. All calves were moved to individual pens on day 8, and were given the same commercial milk replacer. Calves were weaned at 61 days of age. Mean live weights at birth were not significantly different among groups except for calves of HF that were greater than other groups (p< 0. 05). Mean daily gains also showed no significant differences among groups including PC and NC. All calves were in good healthy condition, which was also supported by changes in the level of blood parameters, irrespective of the breed of their dams. It is concluded that there was no appreciable effect of the breed of <b>recipient</b> <b>dams</b> on calf performance. The artificial colostrum powder feedin...|$|R
40|$|Parvoviruses have a {{predilection for}} rapidly {{dividing}} cells such as occurs during embryonic development. Potentially, in utero exposure {{could lead to}} immune tolerance in progeny mice. To determine if MPV infection in utero results in immune tolerance, pregnant mice were inoculated by oral gavage with 50 ID 50 MPV 1 e or sham inoculated with phosphate buffered saline at day 5 and 12 gestation. Offspring were fostered to MPV-negative <b>recipient</b> <b>dams</b> prior to development of a milk spot. After confirming the offspring were seronegative for MPV by serology and not shedding by fecal PCR, they were challenged with 50 ID 50 MPV 1 e by oral gavage at weaning or sham inoculated. At 4 weeks post inoculation, all weanlings exposed in utero developed antibodies to MPV, and MPV was detected by fecal PCR. Similarly, all weanlings from sham-inoculated dams challenged with MPV developed antibodies and MPV was detected by fecal PCR. None of the sham inoculated weanling mice from MPV infected dams or sham infected dams developed antibodies to MPV nor was MPV detected by fecal PCR. These results demonstrate that in utero exposure to MPV 1 e via oral gavage was insufficient to induce immune tolerance and provides greater confidence that rederivation techniques may successfully eliminate colonies of MPV. Furthermore, our findings do not provide evidence that MPV tolerance may contribute to hidden infections in mouse colonies...|$|R
