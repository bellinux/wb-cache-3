At his first Prime Minister's Questions on 13 October 2010, he <b>raised</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> government's announced removal of a non-means tested child benefit.|$|E
5|$|In March 1848, Garrison, the Motts, Abby Kelley Foster, Stephen Symonds Foster {{and others}} hosted an Anti-Sabbath meeting in Boston, {{to work toward}} the {{elimination}} of laws that apply only to Sunday, and to gain for the laborer more time away from toil than just one day of rest per week. Lucretia Mott and two other women were active within the executive committee, and Mott spoke to the assemblage. Lucretia Mott <b>raised</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> validity of blindly following religious and social tradition.|$|E
5|$|While sculptors Eric Schilsky (1898–1974) and Hew Lorimer (1907–93) {{worked in}} the {{existing}} tradition of modelling and carving, sculptor and artist Eduardo Paolozzi (1924–2005) was a pioneer of pop art and in a varied career produced many works that examined juxtapositions between fantasy and the modern world. George Wyllie (1921–2012), produced works {{of social and political}} commentary including the Straw Locomotive (1987), an event which <b>raised</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> decline of heavy industry and the nature of colonialism.|$|E

5|$|One {{point of}} {{criticism}} {{is that the}} film gives a misleading impression of the whereabouts and magnitude of Kony's remaining LRA forces. As of early 2012, Kony's followers were thought to number only in the hundreds, and Kony himself {{was believed to be}} in the Central African Republic rather than Uganda—a fact that receives only a passing mention in the video. This problem <b>raised</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> plausibility of Ugandan army intervention, which the video advocates. Since Kony and most of the LRA forces are currently not in Uganda, the Ugandan army would need to coordinate with the governments and militaries of the other countries where the LRA is active.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's death <b>raised</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{succession}} to {{the throne}} {{as well as the}} nature of the Greek regime. As the king had contracted an unequal marriage his descendants were not in the line of succession. The Hellenic Parliament demanded that Constantine I and Crown Prince George be excluded from the succession but sought to preserve the monarchy by selecting another member of the royal house as the new sovereign. On 29 October 1920, the Greek minister in Berne, acting {{under the direction of the}} Greek authorities, offered the throne to Alexander's younger brother, Prince Paul. Paul, however, refused to become king while his father and elder brother were alive, insisting that neither of them had renounced their rights {{to the throne}} and that he therefore could never legitimately wear the crown.|$|E
5|$|From 1254 to 1257, Edward {{was under}} the {{influence}} of his mother's relatives, known as the Savoyards, the most notable of whom was Peter of Savoy, the queen's uncle. After 1257, Edward increasingly fell in with the Poitevin or Lusignan faction – the half-brothers of his father HenryIII – led by such men as William de Valence. This association was significant, because the two groups of privileged foreigners were resented by the established English aristocracy, and they would be at the centre of the ensuing years' baronial reform movement. There were tales of unruly and violent conduct by Edward and his Lusignan kinsmen, which <b>raised</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> royal heir's personal qualities. The next years would be formative on Edward's character.|$|E

5|$|The President {{was coming}} into {{increasing}} conflict with Congress on {{the handling of}} the Zone, including the unusual consolidation of power. In addition to not officially restructuring the Commission, Congress increasingly fought or <b>raised</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> appointments of replacement commissioners. In November 1905, Panama was visited by Poultney Bigelow, a lecturer and writer for the American Geographical Society, who wrote a scathing report on progress in the Canal Zone—a report that was well-publicized in the States. This report criticized the efficiency of the work being performed as well as the quality of its management. Magoon countered this negative press by stressing that Bigelow had visited the Zone for less than two days, one of which was Thanksgiving Day, and that work was naturally lax on the holiday.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 2007, a Class 73 derailed {{after hitting}} an {{avalanche}} between Hallingskeid and Myrdal on the Bergen Line. The accident <b>raised</b> <b>questions</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> class's abilities to handle hard snow, {{such as in}} avalanches. In particular, a DNV report from 1999 had shown that the train could act as a sled, lose contact with the tracks and slide {{on top of the}} snow. A former NSB employee who worked with route planning, stated that a locomotive-hauled train would be better suitable for such situations, because more of the weight is located {{at the front of the}} train, and it will therefore plow instead of slide. The National Rail Administration said that they took extra precautions for the Class 73 trains and that during snowfall they would run a snow-clearing unit ahead of all Class 73 runs. NSB stated that they would consider the possibility of reverting to conventional trains, but that unless new information could shed light on the situation, they would retain use of the Class 73 trains.|$|E
