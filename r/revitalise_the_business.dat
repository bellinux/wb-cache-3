40|$|South Africa as {{a country}} {{producing}} certain commodities is experiencing profound changes {{as a result of}} globalisation. Globalisation refers to the sourcing of goods from locations around the world to take advantage of national differences in the cost and quality of factors of production, such as labour, energy, land and capital. By doing this, companies hope to lower their overall cost structure and improve the quality or functionality of their product offering, thereby allowing them to compete more effectively. To remain competitive in a global environment, having personnel who are accountable for what they have control over, can help <b>revitalise</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> character, strengthen the global competitiveness of corporations, heighten innovation, improve the quality of products and services produced by companies’ world wide, and increase the responsiveness of organisations to the needs and wants of customers. Continental Tyre South Africa (CTSA) is a local and global supplier of tyres, and the global sourcing for tyres by sales divisions, requires CTSA to remain competitive on price in the global market. The overall purpose of the research was to assess the current level of personnel accountability on all levels within manufacturing at CTSA and to formulate recommendations to address the shortfalls identified through the research. The research methodology for this study comprised of the following steps: Firstly, the contextual elements that define accountability were researched; Secondly, the appropriate research methodology techniques were researched and applied. The current level of accountability was assessed in an empirical study which involved completing a questionnaire during structured interviews with respondents; and Thirdly, the data obtained from the questionnaires were analysed showing some areas of accountability, but shortfalls in other areas. The final step of this study entailed the formulation of recommendations to address the shortfalls identified in the different levels and elements of accountability namely: Responsibility, Ability, Means, Authority and Measuremen...|$|E

It hired an architect to draw up preliminary plans for a garage and selected the site themselves, which was occupied by smaller, older structures housing residences and <b>businesses.</b> <b>The</b> <b>business</b> association urged city council to expropriate these inhabitants.
