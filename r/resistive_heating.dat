40|$|A three {{dimensional}} numerical framework with {{finite volume}} method {{was employed to}} simulate heat generation of a semi lithium ion battery (LIB) cell during isothermal galvanostatic discharge processes. The microstructure of the LIB cathode electrode was experimentally determined using X-ray nano computed tomography technology. Heat generation in the semi LIB cell during galvanostatic discharge processes from different mechanisms, such as electronic <b>resistive</b> <b>heat,</b> ionic <b>resistive</b> <b>heat,</b> contact <b>resistive</b> <b>heat,</b> reaction heat, entropic heat and heat of mixing, was investigated. The spatial distribution of heat generation rates from different mechanisms was also studied. The simulation results demonstrate that the magnitude of heat generation rates spans a wide range in the electrode due to structural inhomogeneity. The simulation results of heat generation from the three dimensional model and the porous-electrode theory model were compared in this study. It is found that the typical Bruggeman coefficient, 1. 5, underestimated ionic resistance in the electrolyte and overestimated electronic resistance in the cathode particles. In general, the three dimensional model predicted more heat generation than the porous-electrode theory model at large discharge rates due to the wider distribution of physical and electrochemical properties...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{applications}} of NiTi alloys in orthodontics rely on the pseudoelastic properties developed at temperatures higher than Af. That implies as a necessary condition that the body temperature (Tb) be higher than Af; the level of reversion stress, σr depends moreover upon the difference between Tb and Af. Nowadays the interest is directed to obtain an archwire with distinct σr in different segments : that means to modify locally the properties of the wire by local thermal treatments. Current methodologies exploit either the joule effect or a hot air thermal treatment : both have been here used on NiTi archwires to modify (Tb - Af) and, as a consequence, the expected σr. The properties detected along the archwires by means of Differential Scanning Calorimetry, have been found quite disuniform when the active procedure of the <b>resistive</b> <b>heat</b> treatment was used, whilst good uniformity has been found when adopting the passive hot air heat treatment method.

25|$|One {{assumption}} made by Fleischmann and Pons is {{that the}} efficiency of electrolysis is nearly 100%, meaning nearly all the electricity applied to the cell resulted in electrolysis of water, with negligible <b>resistive</b> <b>heating</b> and substantially all the electrolysis product leaving the cell unchanged. This assumption gives {{the amount of energy}} expended converting liquid D2O into gaseous D2 and O2. The efficiency of electrolysis is less than one if hydrogen and oxygen recombine to a significant extent within the calorimeter. Several researchers have described potential mechanisms by which this process could occur and thereby account for excess heat in electrolysis experiments.|$|E

The sample {{is put into}} direct contact with a platinum wire, or placed in a quartz sample tube, and rapidly heated to 600–1000°C. Depending on the application even higher temperatures are used.

Large molecules cleave at their weakest points and produce smaller, more volatile fragments. These fragments can be separated by gas chromatography. Pyrolysis GC chromatograms are typically complex because {{a wide range of}} different decomposition products is formed.

To increase the volatility of polar fragments, various methylating reagents can be added to a sample before pyrolysis.|$|E

When using the pulsed ruby laser this was unreliable due to the short pulse. YAG lasers quickly become the standard, heating for relatively long duration, and allowing observation of the sample throughout the heating process. It was with the first use of YAG lasers that Bassett used an optical pyrometer to measure temperatures {{in the range of}} 1000°C to 1600°C. The first temperature measurements had a standard deviation of 30°C from the brightness temperature, but due to the small sample size was estimated to be 50°C with the possibility that the true temperature of the sample being was 200°C higher than that of the brightness measurement. Spectrometry of the incandescent light became the next method of temperature measurement used in Bassett's group. The energy of the emitted radiation could be compared to known black body radiation spectra to derive a temperature. Calibration of these systems is done with published melting points or melting points as measured by <b>resistive</b> <b>heating.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Heating in diamond-anvil {{cells is}} {{typically}} done by two means, external or internal heating. External heating {{is defined as}} heating the anvils and would include a number of resistive heaters that are placed around the diamonds or around the cell body. The complementary method {{does not change the}} temperature of the anvils and includes fine resistive heaters placed within the sample chamber and laser heating. The main advantage to <b>resistive</b> <b>heating</b> is the precise measurement of temperature with thermocouples, but the temperature range is limited by the properties of the diamond which will oxidize in air at 700°C [...] The use of an inert atmosphere can extend this range above 1000°C.

40|$|Design of wiring for {{aerospace}} vehicles {{relies on}} {{an understanding of}} "ampacity" which refers to the current carrying capacity of wires, either, individually or in wire bundles. Designers rely on standards to derate allowable current flow to prevent exceedance of wire temperature limits due to <b>resistive</b> <b>heat</b> dissipation within the wires or wire bundles. These standards often add considerable margin and are based on empirical data. Commercial providers are taking an aggressive approach to wire sizing which challenges the conventional wisdom of the established standards. Thermal modelling of wire bundles may offer significant mass reduction in a system if the technique can be generalized to produce reliable temperature predictions for arbitrary bundle configurations. Thermal analysis {{has been applied to}} the problem of wire bundles wherein any or all of the wires within the bundle may carry current. Wire bundles present analytical challenges because the heat transfer path from conductors internal to the bundle is tortuous, relying on internal radiation and thermal interface conductance to move the heat from within the bundle to the external jacket where it can be carried away by convective and radiative heat transfer. The problem is further complicated by the dependence of wire electrical resistivity on temperature. Reduced heat transfer out of the bundle leads to higher conductor temperatures and, hence, increased <b>resistive</b> <b>heat</b> dissipation. Development of a generalized wire bundle thermal model is presented and compared with test data. The steady state heat balance for a single wire is derived and extended to the bundle configuration. The generalized model includes the effects of temperature varying resistance, internal radiation and thermal interface conductance, external radiation and temperature varying convective relief from the free surface. The sensitivity of the response to uncertainties in key model parameters is explored using Monte Carlo analysis...|$|R

40|$|Containerless melting and {{solidification}} {{requires a}} sample {{that is in}} some way suspended, or levitated against gravity, away from contact with any containing walls. There are several ways of achieving this goal, as given in earlier chapters. In the case of electromagnetic levitation, the lifting/confining force is commonly provided using a medium/high-frequency AC current positioning coil. An opposing eddy current develops within the sample, {{which in this case}} needs to be electrically conducting; the interaction of the coil and induced currents leads to the repelling Lorentz force. Other interactions follow as a consequence: assuming that the sample is an alloy melt, the Lorentz force also drives convection within it and the induced current generates <b>resistive</b> <b>heat</b> in a sample of finite conductivity.

While the processes of vaporization/ cutting and desiccation/coagulation are best accomplished with relatively low voltage, continuous or near continuous waveforms, the process of fulguration is performed with relatively high voltage modulated waveforms. Fulguration is a superficial type of coagulation, typically created by arcing modulated high voltage current to tissue that is rapidly desiccated and coagulated.

2500|$|... where [...] is {{the number}} of {{theoretical}} plates, [...] is the apparent mobility in the separation medium and [...] is the diffusion coefficient of the analyte. [...] According to this equation, the efficiency of separation is only limited by diffusion and is proportional to the strength of the electric field, although practical considerations limit the strength of the electric field to several hundred volts per centimeter. [...] Application of very high potentials (>20-30 kV) may lead to arcing or breakdown of the capillary. [...] Further, application of strong electric fields leads to <b>resistive</b> <b>heating</b> (Joule heating) of the buffer in the capillary. [...] At sufficiently high field strengths, this heating is strong enough that radial temperature gradients can develop within the capillary. [...] Since electrophoretic mobility of ions is generally temperature-dependent (due to both temperature-dependent ionization and solvent viscosity effects), a non-uniform temperature profile results in variation of electrophoretic mobility across the capillary, and a loss of resolution. [...] The onset of significant Joule heating can be determined by constructing an [...] "Ohm's Law plot", wherein the current through the capillary is measured as a function of applied potential. [...] At low fields, the current is proportional to the applied potential (Ohm's Law), whereas at higher fields the current deviates from the straight line as heating results in decreased resistance of the buffer. [...] The best resolution is typically obtained at the maximum field strength for which Joule heating is insignificant (i.e. near the boundary between the linear and nonlinear regimes of the Ohm's Law plot). [...] Generally capillaries of smaller inner diameter support use of higher field strengths, due to improved heat dissipation and smaller thermal gradients relative to larger capillaries, but with the drawbacks of lower sensitivity in absorbance detection due to shorter path length, and greater difficulty in introducing buffer and sample into the capillary (small capillaries require greater pressure and/or longer times to force fluids through the capillary).|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} keep the supply of {{electricity}} consistent and to deal with varying electrical loads it is necessary to decrease the difference between generation and demand. If this is done by changing loads it is referred to as demand side management (DSM). [...] For decades, utilities have sold off-peak power to large consumers at lower rates, to encourage these users to shift their loads to off-peak hours, {{in the same way that}} telephone companies do with individual customers. [...] Usually, these time-dependent prices are negotiated ahead of time. [...] In an attempt to save more money, some utilities are experimenting with selling electricity at minute-by-minute spot prices, which allow those users with monitoring equipment to detect demand peaks as they happen, and shift demand to save both the user and the utility money. Demand side management can be manual or automatic and is not limited to large industrial customers. In residential and small business applications, for example, appliance control modules can reduce energy usage of water heaters, air conditioning units, refrigerators, and other devices during these periods by turning them off for some portion of the peak demand time or by reducing the power that they draw. Energy demand management includes more than reducing overall energy use or shifting loads to off-peak hours. A particularly effective method of energy demand management involves encouraging electric consumers to install more energy efficient equipment. For example, many utilities give rebates for the purchase of insulation, weatherstripping, and appliances and light bulbs that are energy efficient. Some utilities subsidize the purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers, to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient, as well as to reduce the winter electricity demand compared to conventional air-sourced heat pumps or <b>resistive</b> <b>heating.</b> Companies with factories and large buildings can also install such products, but they can also buy energy efficient industrial equipment, like boilers, or use more efficient processes to produce products. Companies may get incentives like rebates or low interest loans from utilities or the government for the installation of energy efficient industrial equipment. Facilities may shift their demand by enlisting a third party to provide Energy Storage as a Service (ESaaS).|$|E
