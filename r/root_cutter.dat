They gained {{practically}} 2 punds per head daily colorado agricultural college Summary Potatoes fed in livestoek rations are generally comparable to good corn silage. Potatoes may be fed raw to cattle, sheep, horses and swine but are best cooked for swine. Raw potatoes have only 213 {{the value of}} cooked potatoes fed to pigs. Raw potatoes proved {{to be as good}} as cooked potatoes fed to dairy cows. Raw potatoes may safely constitute 1 / 2 the dry matter in ra-tions for cattle and sheep and 14 the dry m'atter in rations for horses. Cooked or raw potatoes should not replace more than 1 / 2 the grain allowance in fattening pigs. Raw potatoes fed to dairy cows at the rate of from 25 to 35 pounds daily have actually increased milk production but larger amOUht-s will taint the milk, cause a salvy butter and may cause indigestion ~nd bloating. The dry matter in potatoes is composed largely of starch, a carbohydrate valuable in both fattening and milk-producing operations. Potatoes are low in protein or growth-producing material and some protein concentrate or roughage should be fed with them. Raw potatoes are best fed sliced thru a <b>root</b> <b>cutter.</b> Frozen, rotted or decayed potatoes may cause trouble if fed to livestock. Raw potatoes have an acrid taste and tend to increase the flow of digestive juices. They should not be fed with other feeds that tend to irritate the digestive system and they should always be fed with cauti 9 n...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Plunge shaving is {{the most}} {{advanced}} gear finishing technique which only needs radial infeed. Its advantages include increased productivity, accuracy, long tool life, and a simple machine structure. For the plunge shaving method, the gear tooth modification only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge shaving cutter. The analytical description of the gear with tooth modifications is firstly constructed by B-spline surface fitting. Then, the grinding wheel profile is parameterized and optimized for minimizing the surface deviations of theoretical and ground (from re-sharpening machine) tooth surfaces of the plunge shaving cutter, in which the topographic error has been reduced. The cutting trace of plunge shaving cutter has also been analyzed so that the shaving efficiency can be improved. Index Terms—Gear plunge shaving, Cone grinding wheel, Topographic error, Shaving cutter serration. et al. [9] proposed a method for shaving gears with double crowning by CNC shaving machine. For shaving methods other than plunge shaving, the gear tooth modification is accomplished by tooth modifications of the shaving cutter and the coordinated motions between cutter and gear. For the plunge shaving method, however, it only depends on the surface geometry of the plunge shaving cutter. Focusing on the surface geometry of shaving cutter, what’s really significant is precision of the region between SAP. (start of active profile) and EAP. (end of active profile) as shown in Fig. 1. In gear shaving, SAP. of cutter tooth shaves the gear tooth tip while EAP. shaves the gear tooth <b>root.</b> Traditionally, the <b>cutter</b> surface geometry results from a cutter re-sharpening machine by trial and error, which is very time-consuming.
