40|$|Channelized {{submarine}} gravity currents travel remarkable distances, transporting sediment to {{the distal}} reaches <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fans.</b> However, the {{mechanisms by which}} flows can be sustained over these distances remain enigmatic. In this paper we consider two shallow water models the first assumes the flow is unstratified whilst the second uses empirical models to describe vertical stratification, which effects depth averaged mass and momentum transfer. The importance of stratification is elucidated through comparison of modeled flow dynamics. It is found that the vertically stratified model shows the best fit to field data from a channelized field-scale gravity current in the Black Sea. Moreover, the stratified flow is confined by the channel to a much greater degree than the flow in the unstratified model. However, both models fail to accurately represent flow dynamics in the distal end of the system, suggesting current empirical stratification models require improvement to accurately describe field-scale gravity currents. It also highlights the limitations of weakly stratified small-scale experiments in describing field-scale processes. The results suggest that in real-world systems stratification is likely to enable maintenance of velocity and discharge within the channel, thus facilitating sediment suspension over distances of hundreds of kilometers on low seafloor gradients. This explains how flows can travel remarkable distances and transport their sediment to the distal parts <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fans.</b> Key Points Vertical stratification of density-driven flows enhances runout length Existing empirical models under predict flow stratification Stratification may explain formation of sandy lobes at the end <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fans...</b>|$|R
30|$|The trap {{formation}} for Meishan <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> {{is mainly}} caused by the deposition pinching out (Fig.  8 d). As the entire basin subsided continuously in Neocene, the later differential regional tectonic subsidence affected the structural height. In Pliocene and Pleistocene, the subsidence centers transferred to the Ledong sag gradually, which led to terrain reversal, so the pinch out position of fans reworked by bottom currents became the highpoint of trap formation. Overall, deposition pinching out is the main controlled factor <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> traps.|$|R

40|$|When we {{look back}} the {{contributions}} on <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> during the past 65 years (1950 – 2015), the empirical data on 21 modern <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> and 10 ancient deep-water systems, published {{by the results of}} the First COMFAN (Committee on FANs) Meeting (Bouma et al., 1985 a), have remained the single most significant compilation <b>of</b> data on <b>submarine</b> <b>fans.</b> The 1970 s were the “heyday” <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> models. In the 21 st century, the general focus has shifted from <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> to <b>submarine</b> mass movements, internal waves and tides, and contourites. The purpose of this review is to illustrate the complexity of issues surrounding the origin and classification <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fans.</b> The principal elements <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fans,</b> composed <b>of</b> canyons, channels, and lobes, are discussed using nine modern case studies from the Mediterranean Sea, the Equatorial Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Pacific, the NE Indian Ocean (Bay of Bengal), and the East Sea (Korea). The Annot Sandstone (Eocene–Oligocene), exposed at Peira-Cava area, SE France, which served as the type locality for the “Bouma Sequence”, was reexamined. The field details are documented in questioning the validity of the model, which was the basis for the turbidite-fan link. The 29 fan-related models that are of conceptual significance, developed during the period 1970 – 2015, are discussed using modern and ancient systems. They are: (1) the classic <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> model with attached lobes, (2) the detached-lobe model, (3) the channel-levee complex without lobes, (4) the delta-fed ramp model, (5) the gully-lobe model, (6) the suprafan lobe model, (7) the depositional lobe model, (8) the fan lobe model, (9) the ponded lobe model, (10) the nine models based on grain size and sediment source, (11) the four fan models based on tectonic settings, (12) the Jackfork debrite model, (13) the basin-floor fan model, (14) supercritical and subcritical fans, and (15) the three types of fan reservoirs. Each model is unique, and the long-standing belief that <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> are composed <b>of</b> turbidites, in particular, of gravelly and sandy high-density turbidites, is a myth. This is because there are no empirical data to validate the existence of gravelly and sandy high-density turbidity currents in the modern marine environments. Also, there are no experimental documentation of true turbidity currents that can transport gravels and coarse sands in turbulent suspension. Mass-transport processes, which include slides, slumps, and debris flows (but not turbidity currenrs), are the most viable mechanisms for transporting gravels and sands into the deep sea. The prevailing notion that <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> develop during periods of sea-level lowstands is also a myth. The geologic reality is that frequent short-term events that last for only a few minutes to several hours or days (e. g., earthquakes, meteorite impacts, tsunamis, tropical cyclones, etc.) are more important in controlling deposition of deep-water sands than sporadic long-term events that last for thousands to millions of years (e. g., lowstand systems tract). <b>Submarine</b> <b>fans</b> are still in a stage of muddled turbidite paradigm because the concept of high-density turbidity currents is incommensurable...|$|R
30|$|The third type <b>of</b> the Meishan <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> is the fan {{reworked}} by bottom currents, {{which are}} {{distributed in the}} central low-lying area in the Ledong and Lingshui sags. Sand-body develops along the axis of the basin. Moreover, the sand-body thickness becomes thinner abruptly, comparing to the adjacent basin floor fan, and the seismic profiles show low-amplitude incised characteristics in sandstone bottom interface. All the features above illustrate {{that the effect of}} bottom current paralleling with the slope existed in the basin center. It is speculated that the bottom current occur when channelizing processes <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> began. The sandstone reworked by bottom currents has better sorting, homogeneity, and permeability than those of the other two types of fans. Drilling results prove that the <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> reworked by bottom currents have box-shaped characteristics of gamma ray curve. The sedimentary features mostly include massive bedding and its lithology is well-sorted thick fine sandstone. The channels have weak erosion with medium-strong amplitude reflection shown in seismic profiles.|$|R

30|$|Modern {{and ancient}} <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> contain a complex blend of gravel, sand, and mud (Shanmugam and Moiola 1988). However, hyperpycnal flows cannot be {{responsible}} for transporting gravel and sand from the land, carrying them 10 − 100 km⋅s−[*] 1 across the shelf (Fig. 3), and delivering them to the deep sea. For example, {{no one has ever}} documented by direct measurements or observations of transport of gravel and sand by hyperpycnal flows in suspension from the shoreline to the deep sea in modern settings. Without acknowledging this fundamental lack of empirical data, Warrick et al. (2013) suggested formation <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> by hyperpycnal plume-derived sediments in the Santa Barbara Channel, California. Shallow-water muddy hyperpycnal flows {{should not be confused with}} deep-water sandy turbidity currents (Shanmugam 2012).|$|R
30|$|The {{submarine}} MTD in the Akkeshi Formation is {{from the}} central section of the Upper Cretaceous–Paleocene Nemuro Group in the southern Nemuro Peninsula, eastern Hokkaido Island, Japan (Fig.  1), and is interpreted to have been deposited in the fore-arc basin of the Kuril Arc (Kiminami 1983). The Nemuro Group is composed of the Nokkamappu, Otadai, Monshizu, Hamanaka, Akkeshi, and Kiritappu formations, in ascending order, and is unconformably overlain by the Eocene Urahoro Group. The Nemuro Group is composed <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> deposits that contain hemipelagic mudstone, as well as turbidites and submarine slump deposits (Kiminami 1978; Naruse 2003).

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{passage of}} {{turbidity}} currents over <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> {{often results in}} intense channelization. The channels are typically bounded by levees, and vary from mildly to strongly meandering. The process of self-channelization remains, however, somewhat obscure. Preliminary experiments reported here demonstrate {{for the first time}} that self-channelization of subaqueous fans by turbidity currents can be reproduced at laboratory scale. The resulting weakly sinuous channels can be predominantly depositional, predominantly erosional or some combination of the two. The channels can elongate to the length of the entire reach available for their formation. They can show both gradual shift and avulsion. Two necessary conditions for the formation of intense channelization appear to be a) a multiplicity of grain sizes and b) a turbidity current that is insufficient to cover the entire area of the fan at any given time. Field analogs to the experimental channelized fans can often be found at the distal end <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fans.</b> An example from the Gulf of Cadiz is cited...|$|R
40|$|The Lower Tertiary outcrop {{along the}} coast of Guipuzcoa, {{northern}} Spain, consists exclusively of deep-marine sediments, deposited in a narrow elongated (ESE-WNW) basin. The early Tertiary sedimentary history of this basin can be described in terms of three main phases:- a phase of predominantly (hemi-) pelagic deposition (almost the entire Paleocene);- a phase of deposition from axially flowing carbonate-rich turbidity currents (latest Paleocene to earliest Eocene);- a phase of lateral input of predominantly terrigenous clastics via <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> (largest part <b>of</b> the early Eocene). During the latter two phases (hemi-) pelagic sedimentation became proportionally less important -due to increasing rates of turbidite sedimentation. Late Maastrichtian to early Paleocene diapirism of Upper Triassic evaporites had created swells and depressions In the basin floor and controlled the deposition of turbidites well into the early Eocene. Various facies associations can be distinguished In the Lower Eocene turbidite successions. In the 'middle fan association' thick-bedded proximal turbidites are concentrated in overall non-channelised packages, tens of metres thick, which internally show channelling. In the 'outer fan association' thick-bedded proximal turbidites have planar geometries but are still concentrated in packages. A vertical section through these packages commonly displays a crude coarsening - and thickening - upward trend of beds. In the 'fan fringe association' thick-bedded proximal turbidites no longer occur concentrated in groups but disseminated in a matrix of thin-bedded distal turbidites. The 'basin plain association' is characterised by monotonous successions of thin-bedded turbidites. (Hemi-) Pelagic interbeds may be present in all of these facies associations. Vertical and later 1 arrangements of different facies associations can be interpreted to terms of episodes of progradation and abandonment <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> systems. Long-distance lateral facies relationships could only be established with the aid of biostratigraphic control, for which use was made of calcareous nannoplankton from the interbedded hemipelagic marls. In the Lower Eocene the turbidites derived from the northern basin margin are carbonate-cemented quartz-arenites. Those derived from the southern basin margin have a lithic-arenitic composition. The stratigraphic superposition <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> fed from opposite basin margins directly indicates that the deep-marine basin must have been rather narrow, probably only a few tens of kilometres wide...|$|R

40|$|The Van Keulenfjorden {{transect}} on Spitsbergen offers valuable {{insight into}} submarine processes, with well exposed seismic scale clinoforms of Paleocene and Eocene age, which show {{the distribution of}} sediments from deltaic to basin floor environments. Several progradational <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> are preserved as cliffs on Hyrnestabben. They serve as an analogues to coarse grained <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> in provinces <b>of</b> the Barents Sea margin. The architecture <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> bodies is <b>of</b> importance to petroleum exploration, as the distribution of sand prone lobes impact fluid migration reservoir compartmentalization, and {{the presence or absence}} of baffles. Gravity flow processes emplace different deposits affecting deep sea fans that change according to both allogenic and autogenic factors, at scales below the limits of seismic detection. Detailed sedimentological and stratigraphic study was conducted on three shelf proximal <b>submarine</b> <b>fans,</b> <b>of</b> the Frysjaodden Formation, to record and characterize flow transformations as they occur in the deep sea environment. The fans had similar overall stacking patterns, with thin bedded heterolithic deposits overlain by thick sandy amalgamated lobes.

Evidence for flow transformations occurred as linked debrites both proximal to the slope and in distal locations, the result of abrupt slope changes and down flow changes flow process.

30|$|Deep sea channel {{systems are}} {{recognized}} as important components of continental margin bathymetry, due to their pivotal {{role in shaping the}} morphology <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fans.</b> <b>Submarine</b> <b>fans</b> are the largest clastic accumulations on Earth and receive sediment through canyon-channel systems. The sediment transfer zones between terrestrial sources and deep sea depositional sinks include submarine canyon-channel systems, which generally transition from erosional V-shaped canyons indenting the upper and mid slope of the continental shelf, to U-shaped channels with over bank deposits across the lower continental slope and rise (Covault 2011). Despite this role in connecting the continent and the deep sea it is not always clear how canyons transform from being incisive on the continental slope to being constructive on the abyssal seafloor. If sediment is stored and reworked from locations along a channel system then this may be a source of signal shredding between the source and ultimate sink, in addition to the shredding seen in alluvial flood plains (Castelltort and Van Den Driessche 2003; Jerolmack and Paola 2010). Quantifying the buffering role that channel systems play and how this evolves downslope is best achieved by better mapping of active channels on the largest <b>submarine</b> <b>fans.</b> This is crucial if the abyssal turbidite record is to be used to understand evolving continental environmental conditions in the source regions.|$|R
40|$|The Imsdalen <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex is {{a gravel}} and coarse sand {{dominated}} turbidite fan system. The fan complex was {{deposited in the}} Neoproterozoic Hedmark rift basin close to a basin margin bordered by the Imsdalen Fault. The Imsdalen Fault {{is supposed to be}} inherited from a syn-sedimentary strike-slip fault zone that was reactivated during the Caledonian nappe emplacement. Ten sedimentary logs cover a stratigraphic section more than 4 km thick. Thirteen facies have been organized into five facies associations, representing architectural elements including base-of-slope to upper fan feeder channel complex, upper fan distributary channel complex, middle to lower fan channel-lobe complex, fringed sheets, and fi ne-grained overbank and basin-plain deposits. The Imsdalen <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex is divided into eleven fan systems, separated by erosional surfaces, interpreted as sequence boundaries, except for the boundary at the base of fan 6, interpreted to be a maximum fl ooding surface. Overall, the eleven fan systems form a turbidite succession that records a long history of aggradation to retrogradation, as shown by the fans 1 to 8, followed by a phase of marked progradation, displayed by the fans 9 to 11, from middle to lower, to upper fan positions. It is suggested that the main factor in control of the development <b>of</b> the Imsdalen <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex was related to fault activity at the basin margin and sediment supply. The Imsdalen <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex shows that gravity fl ow processes have the capacity and competence to transport huge amounts of coarse sand and gravel at least 40 to 60 kilometres into a deep-marine basin. The long transport distance of the coarse-clastic material is interpreted {{as a result of the}} combined effects of very high rates of coarseclastic sediment supply, high potential energy along the submarine slope, high slope gradient, creation of accommodation due to high rate of basin subsidence, channelized transport, and effective mechanisms of clast support in the gravity fl ow system. These observations suggest that the high and low effi ciency concept <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> systems, as a function of grain size distribution of the available sediment should be modifi ed...|$|R
30|$|Based on a {{large amount}} of seismic, {{drilling}} and core data, the characteristics of the early-middle Miocene <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> in the Baiyun Sag, northern South China Sea are investigated. By analyzing the sedimentary processes <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> in SQ 21 (SQ 21 refers to the 3 rd-order sequence with its bottom boundary 21 Ma), a sedimentary model of the sand-rich fans is established and the main factors controlling fan deposition are detailed. The results indicate that from early to middle Miocene the Pearl River Mouth Basin developed seven 3 rd-order sequences in all, with each lowstand systems tract (LST) of the sequence corresponding to <b>submarine</b> <b>fans.</b> However, only the fans in SQ 13.8 and SQ 21 are sand-rich fans, the others being mud-rich fans. The cores reveal that the <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> in the Pearl River Mouth Basin developed five lithofacies: (1) mud clast-bearing sandstone, interpreted as channel deposits; (2) typical turbidite sandstones, also interpreted as channel deposits; (3) thin-bedded sandstone and mudstone, interpreted as channel-levee complex deposits; (4) massive sandstones, interpreted as lobe deposits; (5) massive mudstone, interpreted as hemipelagic mud. The sand-rich <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> in the Pearl River Mouth Basin mainly developed in LST, and in LST reverse faults were active, which {{led to the formation of}} accommodation on the shelf. Different from the theory of classic sequence stratigraphy, the accommodation on the shelf captures terrigenous debris transported by the Pearl River, and the uplift at the edge of shelf serves as a “Linear Source” for the deep water area instead of the Pearl River. Therefore, the fans mainly derived from the eroded debris from the uplift. Factors controlling fan deposition include the basin’s tectonic framework, the evolution of the slope break, relative sea-level changes as well as the evolution of the fault system, and the fans are formed under the combination of the above factors.|$|R

30|$|The {{second type}} <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> is basin floor fan. Due to {{differential}} subsidence, {{there was no}} typical Miocene abyssal plain developed in the Qingdongnan Basin. Conversely, many wide low-lying areas existed from slope toe {{to the center of}} the Ledong and Lingshui sags, making it easy to form stable superposed gravity fluid flow deposits. The basin floor fans have classical fan shapes with several sedimentary units, such as inner fan feeding channel, branch channel, overbank-natural, bank front lobe, and so on. Their feeder channels locate in the slope toe along NW–SE direction. There are two short-straight feeder channels developing successively, which extend about 10  km long and 1  km wide. The ends of channels converge and overlap each other, indicating a stable environment in their depositional center. The seismic profiles present the features of medium-strong amplitude reflection and continuous seismic events, and the V-shaped incisions can be seen on underlying stratums. In addition, a few natural levees are developed on the margin of channels. Drilling results reveal that the fillings in the channels are moderate-coarse sandstone with poorer sorting and box-shaped logs.|$|R

Lithesome I consists of a chaotic conglomerate with isolated sandstone lenses and is interpreted to have been deposited in a shallow, steeply sloping, shelf-like environment. Lithesome II consists of a structureless sandstone interbedded with small siltstone rip-up clast layers. This lithesome is interpreted to have been deposited on the lower middle area <b>of</b> a <b>submarine</b> <b>fan.</b> Lithosomes IIIa and IIIb are made up of brown and black shales, respectively, and have both been assigned to interchannel areas <b>of</b> a <b>submarine</b> <b>fan.</b> Lithesome IV consists of interbedded shale and sandstone and is interpreted to have been deposited on channel levees <b>of</b> a <b>submarine</b> <b>fan.</b> Lithesome V is made up of cyclic-bedded pebble conglomerate, sandstone, and siltstone layers that were deposited in channels in the middle submarine-fan area. Lithesome VI consists of regularly bedded pebble conglomerate, graded sandstone, and laminated siltstone beds that were deposited in the lower-upper submarine-fan channel. Lithesome VII is composed of a matrix-supported cobble conglomerate with isolated sandstone lenses and is interpreted to have been deposited in the upper submarine-fan channel. The fan deposits are assigned to the Relizian and Luisian (medial Miocene) benthonic foraminiferal stages based on microfossils found in several shale units. Age-diagnostic benthonic foraminifera include Bolivina advena, Uvigerinella obesa obesa, Siphogenerina cf. S. collomi, Valvulineria miocenica and Valvulineria californica. During the Relizian and Luisian Stages (medial Miocene), sediment was eroded from the Rincon and older formations exposed northeast of lower Piru Creek and was deposited in the area of lower Piru Creek. In addition to this sediment, minor contributions may have been made by the San Gabriel Mountains which were north and northeast of lower Piru Creek during the Miocene. Sediment was deposited across a steep (5 ?? to 10 ??), narrow, shelf-like environment which deepened to bathyal depths over a horizontal distance of 1. 6 to 4. 8 km (1 - 3 mi). The submarine-fan deposits prograded seaward to the southeast.

40|$|Abstract The Lillehammer <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex {{is a mixed}} mud/sand rich turbidite fan system. The fan complex was {{deposited}} in the Neoproterozoic Hedmark rift basin from west towards east extending at least 50 km from the basin margin. A detailed sedimentary study of outcrops in the Lillehammer area is performed {{with the aim of}} analyzing the depositional environment as an analogue for subsurface turbidite systems. Seven sedimentary logs cover a nearly 1000 meter thick stratigraphic section. Seven facies have been organized into seven facies associations, representing architectural elements including basin plain-thin bedded turbidites, basin plain-hemipelagic shale, lobe, lobe-channel, basin floor channel infill, major channel and channel-levee. The Lillehammer <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex represents two or three fan systems, separated by hemipelagic black shale or thick unit of homogenous shale that may indicate rise in relative sea level. The overall system is progradational and represents an outer and middle to inner fan environment. The main factors controlling the development <b>of</b> the Lillehammer <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex are thought to be tectonic activity at the basin margin and sediment influx. Comparison <b>of</b> the Lillehammer <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex with the Upper Cretaceous fans in the Vøring Basin reveals a good geometrical resemblance despite large differences in sandstone petrography and clay matrix content. The petrographic more impure and clay-rich sandstones <b>of</b> the Lillehammer <b>Submarine</b> <b>Fan</b> Complex, as compared with those in the Vøring Basin, is interpreted to be related to differences in provenance and basin structure. Synthetic seismograms were performed for a 400 meter thick logged section to discuss the differences in seismic resolution under 1500 meter of overload and 3500 meter of overload. Only half of the seismic events are shown in the deepest model compared to the shallow model. Reflections associated with most interfaces are recognizable, but difficult to distinguish from each other. The shallow model reveals good seismic resolution of two fans separated by a thick layer of homogenous shale. The same model under a thicker overload does not have the same obvious trends, but is recognizable when you know what to expect...|$|R

Lobe related environments display {{a higher level of}} diversity and bioturbation intensity in more distal/off axis (lobe fringe) environments compared to the most axial lobe environments that preserve low diversity, and exclusively post-depositional assemblages (dominated by Ophiomorpha). Diverse pre- and post-depositional assemblages are common in fan fringe deposits, with less diverse assemblages dominated by post-depositional ichnotaxa (particularly Zoophycos) in basin floor fan deposits. The use of 'sub-ichnofacies' is found to only aid characterisation of trace fossil assemblages based on a general (proximal-distal) position within a <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> system. Tier preservation of trace fossil assemblages is almost exclusively determined by the depth of erosion that a substrate is subjected to. As such, colonisation style (pre- versus post depositional) and ethological groupings are proposed as being the most powerful tool in assisting sedimentological observations in assigning environments of deposition...|$|R
40|$|Submarine density flows {{dominate}} {{sediment transport}} into {{many parts of}} the ocean and form <b>submarine</b> <b>fans,</b> which are some of the largest sediment accumulations on Earth. Previous studies often assumed that the distal fringes <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> would be dominated by extensive sheet-like deposits from dilute and expanded turbidity currents, because only turbidity currents would transport large volumes of sediment for long distances across such low gradients. Deposits with a remarkable frondlike shape occur at the furthest fringe <b>of</b> the Mississippi <b>submarine</b> <b>fan.</b> Understanding the emplacement process of these deposits is important because their frondlike shape suggests deposition from debris flows rather than turbidity currents. Previous analyses concluded that these deposits comprise a complex arrangement of thin interbedded turbidity current and debris flow deposits. Here we propose a different internal geometry for the frondlike deposits. Intervals previously described as in place turbidites are interpreted to be clasts within a single debrite interval that is ~ 1 to 2 m thick. This debrite interval is underlain by clean sand. The debrite interval could have been emplaced by multiple debris flows, or one event comprising multiple pulses. Clasts in the debrite interval are much bigger than previously thought, including boulders with diameters that can exceed 50 cm. We show that thin (~ 2 m) and extremely fluidal debris flows could have carried these boulders across gradients of only 0. 06 ° to the fringes of one of the world's largest <b>submarine</b> <b>fans,</b> without hydroplaning. This long transport distance could occur if the density of the clasts was less than that of the surrounding debris flow. Emplacement of the basal clean sand layer appears closely linked to debris flow deposition because the clean sand layer pinches out in a location {{similar to that of the}} overlying debrite. We therefore suggest that the basal clean sand most likely settled out from the overlying debris flows, and that the clean sand is not a fore running turbidity current deposit. Shearing at the base of a mud-rich debris flow would most likely produce a muddy basal sand interval, rather than the clean sand that is observed. This basal sand interval is therefore less likely to be a record of a lubricating layer with high-pore-fluid-pressure on which the debris flows moved. This study shows how thin and highly mobile debris flows can redistribute large volumes of sediment including bouldersized clasts long distances into the deep ocean across remarkably low gradients...|$|R
30|$|Although {{the basic}} {{model in which}} avulsing depositional lobes migrate across the surface <b>of</b> a <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> has been well-established, it is often unclear what {{controls}} the architecture of a channel belt in detail and thus {{the distribution of the}} subsequent sedimentary deposits. Examples within the geological record are documented but typically lack the spatial extent to be able to fully understand how the basin geometry controls channel morphology. In foreland basins the longitudinal aspect of the basin usually acts to guide the geometry of the channels (De Ruig and Hubbard 2006) but in more open systems such as deep-sea basins the role of ridges or seamounts is less well-defined.|$|R
40|$|The Bengal Fan has {{developed}} {{as a result of}} the collision of India with Asia, resulting in the orogeny of the Himalayas. Erosion of the Himalayas since Eocene times had formed the largest <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> on Earth today. Accordingly, the Bengal Fan is well suited to study the tectonic and climatic history of the Himalayas, but also to analyze architecture and depositional processes <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> and channel-levee systems in general. In this thesis, the active channel-levee system of the Middle Bengal Fan is described by a combined analysis of Parasound and Hydrosweep data. Morphological parameters of the channel and the structure of the levees are analyzed. The results are used to describe the built-up of the active channel-levee system, which is mainly controlled by frequent avulsions within the system leading to numerous cut-off loops. The development of the system is then discussed and compared with other <b>submarine</b> <b>fans.</b> Furthermore, high-resolution seismic data are used to reveal the structure of the active and buried channel-levee systems on the Middle Bengal Fan. Downfan changes of the individual channel-levee systems are analyzed, and differences between the systems are discussed. Two evolutionary scenarios for the active and one buried system are developed and discussed. Finally, the reservoir potential of channel-levee systems in the study area is described. Additionally, high-resolution seismic data collected on four long east-west profiles located on the Middle and Lower Bengal Fan are analyzed. The architecture of surface and buried channel-levee systems and their downfan variations are revealed and the built-up of distinct channel-levee complexes on the upper Middle Fan is discussed. The seismic stratigraphy of the southern profiles is linked to results of DSDP Site 218 and of the ODP Leg 116 site. The seismic results are discussed with respect to deformation events in the central Indian Ocean and to tectonic and climatic events in the Himalayas...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In many deep-marine clastic systems, mass-transport com-plexes (MTCs) {{constitute}} {{a major component}} of the stratigraphy and represent {{an integral part of the}} evolution and depositional style. In tectonically active basins, as is the case in our study of the syntectonic deep-marine Ainsa <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> (Eocene <b>of</b> the Ainsa basin, Spanish Pyrenees), organized, predictable vertical sedimentary sequences provide a testable generic model for <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> development in other basins where tectonic processes provide a first-order driver on fan growth. In the Ainsa basin, the linear <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> were confined by lateral thrust ramps and influenced by intra-basinal growth anticlines. This study represents an integration of outcrop data from sedimentary logs and mapping, with core data from eight wells and micropaleontological and palynomorph analyses. Mapping shows the lateral stepwise migration <b>of</b> sandy channelized <b>submarine</b> <b>fans,</b> as a foreland-propagating clastic wedge. The stepwise foreland migration of each fan (away from the deformatio...|$|R
40|$|Although {{sediment}} waves cover many levees and canyon floors <b>of</b> <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> systems, {{their relation}} to the turbidity currents that formed them is still poorly understood. Over the recent years some large erosional sediment waves have been interpreted as cyclic steps. Cyclic steps {{are a series of}} slowly upslope migrating bedforms (steps), where each downward step (the lee side of the bedform) is manifested by a steeply dropping flow passing through a hydraulic jump before re-accelerating on the flat stoss side. Here, a general comparison is made between sediment waves and cyclic steps. First, the analogies between their geometries and internal structures are explored. Secondly, a basic numerical model is used to construct stability fields for the formation of cyclic steps. These stability fields are compared with large, existing datasets of both fine- and coarse-grained sediment waves. The numerical results enable an explanation of geometrical trends found over series of sediment waves in {{the upper part of the}} Monterey Canyon, on the middle Amazon Fan and on a leveed channel in the Makassar Strait in terms of changes in flow properties of the overriding turbidity current. Based on sedimentological arguments and numerical analysis it is concluded that cyclic steps form a potential alternative for the existing interpretations on the origin of upslope migrating sediment waves...|$|R
40|$|Micropaleontological {{analysis}} of the Barrow Group of Sites 762 and 763 has been undertaken {{with a view to}} determining the stratigraphic age and depositional environment of the unit. The stratigraphic age of the unit is Berriasian-Valanginian at both sites, in line with palynological findings. The unit is interpreted as having been deposited in a marine deltaic environment. Paleobathymetry at Site 763 (proximal) and Site 762 (distal) is interpreted as having been of the order of 100 m and 200 - 500 m, respectively. Paleontological evidence for the presence <b>of</b> deep-water <b>submarine</b> <b>fans</b> at Site 763 is lacking.

40|$|An ichnoassemblage of 10 ichnospecies is {{described}} {{for the first}} time from the Late Silurian Melbourne Formation at Studley Park, Victoria, southeastern Australia. The ichnofauna is preserved in a typical deep-water turbidite succession of alternating thin- to thick-bedded sandstone and thin- to medium-bedded mudrocks. Trace fossils observed within the study site have been assigned to three main ichnofacies. Ichnofacies 1 is best developed on the linguoid-rippled upper surface of thin sandstone beds and includes Laevicyclus, Aulichnites, Nereites, Helminthoidichnites, small Chondrites and possible Zoophycos. Ichnofacies 2 is very similar to Ichnofacies 1 in ichnospecies composition but instead contains large forms of Chondrites together with other thin burrow types usually poorly preserved and in very low abundance compared with Ichnofacies 1. Ichnofacies 3 is preserved mainly as casts on the underside of medium- to thick-bedded turbiditic sandstones, and has a very low diversity, with Planolites being the most common trace. A detailed analysis of the ichnofabrics and tiering structures of these ichnofacies suggest that Ichnofacies 1 and 3 represent "simple tiering’, in contrast to Ichnofacies 2, which is more characteristic of 2 ̆ 7 complex tiering’. Despite the differences in ichnospecies composition and ichnofabrics between the three recognized ichnofacies, the collective ichnoassemblage from the study site can be assigned confidently to the Nereites ichnofacies and is, therefore, interpreted to have formed in a distal <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> environment <b>of</b> lower bathyal to abyssal depth. Further, it is possible to recognize two main subenvironments within this deep-sea setting to account for the differences between the ichnofacies. Ichnofacies 1 and 2 are interpreted to represent a typical Nereites ichnofacies located on a level basin floor subenvironment of relatively low energy conditions at the distal end <b>of</b> a <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> deposit. In comparison, Ichnofacies 3 is dominated by Planolites with rare other facies-crossing trace fossil forms, and lacks Nereites. It is, therefore, best interpreted as representing a relatively high-energy environment, possibly a distributary channel near the distal end <b>of</b> the <b>submarine</b> <b>fan</b> system. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The lithology, {{sedimentology}} and biostratigraphy of the Bozes Formation, which crop {{out in the}} SE Metaliferi Mountains (Apuseni Mts.) {{have been}} investigated {{in order to establish}} the age of the deposits and the depositional environment.

Three facies assemblages have been identified and described. Calcareous nannofossils were used to determine the age of the investigated deposits. The presence of Lucianorhabdus cayeuxii and Calculites obscurus indicates the CC 17 biozone, while UC 13 Zone is pointed out by the continuous occurrence of Arkhangelskiella cymbiformis and the absence of Broinsonia parca parca.
