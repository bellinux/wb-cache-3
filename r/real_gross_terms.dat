40|$|The study {{examined}} the effect of foreign trade on economic growth in Ghana by using a Johansen cointegration analysis. It was found out that all the variables of interest; <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product, foreign direct investment exports, imports and foreign direct investment {{turned out to be}} non stationary at their levels but became stationary at their first difference. The results of Johansens's cointegration test indicated that there exist a long run and short run relationship among <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product, foreign direct investment, exports, imports and foreign direct investment in Ghana. The study found out that in the long run, exports had a positive effect on <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product and as a result, an increase in exports leads to an improvement in <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product. Imports and foreign direct investment had a negative effect on <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product, respectively. Therefore, a decline in both variables causes an improvement in <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product. In the long run all the variables were statistically significant at 5 % significance level. The speed of adjustment was 4. 57 percentage point taking place at each year towards the long run periods. Therefore, exports should be encouraged, diversified, processed raw materials before export to improve the <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product. Imports should be reduced by assisting our infant industries to produce more of our imported goods and services. Finally, foreign direct investment must be channeled to productive sectors of the economy (agriculture, education, health and housing) to improve the <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product of Ghana...|$|R

40|$|The {{determinants}} of <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product growth in Nigeria was ascertained in this study. The research {{was motivated by}} 1. 53 percent decline in <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product growth rate in 2016 coupled with the foreign exchange crisis that engulfed the economy. Specifically, the study determined whether exchange rate and interest rate predict <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product growth using secondary data obtained from Central Bank of Nigeria for the period 1980 to 2016. Aside testing for stationarity of the data and diagnosing the model to meet standard econometric postulations, the Granger Causality prediction estimation was employed to realize {{the objective of the}} research. Firstly, by the application of Johansen cointegration and ARDL methodology, the study identify that exchange rate and interest rate are not co-integrated/related with <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product growth. Secondly, the multiple regression estimated via ARDL shows that exchange rate and interest rate have negative but insignificant relationship with <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product growth. Finally, the study empirically found that exchange rate and interest rate are not {{determinants of}} <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product growth in Nigeria. To strengthen the value of the local currency against the US dollar in particular, and other currencies of the world, a well-managed foreign exchange floating system is preferred.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} economic stability measures (inflation and unemployment rates) on <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product (GDP) in Rwanda. It uses quarterly data {{for the period of}} 2000 Q 1 – 2015 Q 4 collected from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning, Central Bank of Rwanda and the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR). This study concludes that inflation and unemployment have a long-run negative and significant relationship on <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product. In the long run, the coefficients are not significant at the 5 % level; it is only the inflation coefficient and error which are significant. <b>Real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product increases when inflation reduces with a p-value of 0. 00266; <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product increases when unemployment reduces with a p-value of 0. 09882. The coefficient from the error correction model means that the effect of the shock will reduce by 0. 0483 % each quarter, meaning that the effect of the shock will reduce by 19. 32 % in each 4 th quarter. This further means that it will end at 20 quarters, that is, after a five-year period. It has to be highlighted that there is a weak relationship between <b>real</b> <b>gross</b> domestic product and both inflation and unemployment rates. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Trade {{accounts}} for {{a significant number of}} enterprises and contributes a large part to total employment and gross domestic product (GDP) in most developing countries. In India, trade now {{accounts for}} 38 percent of all enterprises and contributes about 14 percent to GDP. In <b>real</b> <b>terms,</b> <b>gross</b> value added in trade has been growing at around 8 percent per annum since 1999 – 2000, indicating that the trade industry {{is one of the key}} drivers of GDP growth in India. Since the retail trade industry in India is predominantly run by unincorporated enterprises, measuring the output of this industry and its contribution to the GDP is difficult. The problem is compounded by the fact that at present the periodic enterprises sample surveys carried out in India on the “unorganized ” sector do not cover trade. This paper explains how India has approached the problem of measuring the gross value added of the retail trade sector by an indirect method involving what is here described as a “labor input method ” and a benchmark-indicator approach using a special trade index. The paper also briefly reviews country practices in measuring the output of retail trade and presents the advantages and disadvantages of India’s approach, particularly in the context of achieving GDP exhaustiveness...|$|R
