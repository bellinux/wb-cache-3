40|$|AbstractAbrasive flow {{machining}} {{has been}} the pioneer of new finishing processes. <b>Rotating</b> <b>workpiece</b> and imposing a magnetic field using magnetorheological working medium are some assisting manipulations to improve surface finishing, because they can increase the forces on the workpiece surface. Similarly, swirling the inlet flow using stationary swirler vanes, as a novel idea, may also increase forces on the surface, and then raise the material removal, with a lower expense and energy consumption compared with the case of workpiece rotation. Thus, in this paper, surface roughness improvement is studied in a pipe with rotating inlet flow of a magnetorheological finishing medium under imposing a magnetic field. The results are compared with the case of <b>rotating</b> <b>workpiece,</b> using 3 D numerical simulation. The governing hydrodynamic parameters are investigated in both cases to monitor the flow variations. It is shown that surface roughness is improved by rotating inlet flow. However, {{it is found that}} finishing in the entrance length of swirling-assisted inlet flow can be so economical for short length workpieces, compared with the case of <b>rotating</b> <b>workpiece,</b> with very near Ra values.
