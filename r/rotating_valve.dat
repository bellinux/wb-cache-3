5000|$|As of 1982, {{the engine}} was a CHT, an {{improved}} version of the [...] "Cléon" [...] engine used in the first Corcel of 1968. It had already been bored and stroked to 1555 cc years earlier, but with a redesigned cylinder head, a <b>rotating</b> <b>valve</b> design and many other peripheral improvements it received a new name and {{a new lease on}} life. On 30 October 1981, Venezuelan assembly of the Corcel II commenced.|$|E
50|$|A {{starting}} valve, {{consisting of}} a Corliss non-throttling <b>rotating</b> <b>valve</b> in combination with a butterfly valve (closed in flight), could divert individual engine output {{to the outside of}} the aircraft, permitting engine starting and ground running with the rotor stationary. Without the valve, back pressure in the duct and rotor system would prevent the starting of the engine. In the P.74 the two Oryx engines fed their outputs to a common duct that took the thrust to the rotor head.|$|E
50|$|The little Silver Diamonds (220 and 240 cid) engines {{featured}} <b>rotating</b> <b>valves</b> {{and improved}} carburetor, plus a ceramic fuel filter and hotter spark plugs. LPG engines, which {{had previously been}} offered only in L-185 and larger models, were available in trucks as light as the R-150 in the new line.|$|R
50|$|Corliss used {{separate}} ports for {{steam supply}} and exhaust, which prevented the exhaust from cooling the passage {{used by the}} hot steam. Corliss also used partially <b>rotating</b> <b>valves</b> that provided quick action, helping to reduce pressure losses. The valves themselves were also a source of reduced friction, especially compared to the slide valve, which typically used 10% of an engine's power.|$|R
50|$|IF {{temperature}} is moderate and pressure is high, then <b>rotate</b> the <b>valve</b> {{a bit to}} the right.|$|R
50|$|For {{getting the}} cooling, {{the source of}} the {{pressure}} variations is unimportant. PTRs for temperatures below 20 K usually operate at frequencies of 1 to 2 Hz and with pressure variations from 10 to 25 bar. The swept volume of the compressor would be very high (up to one liter and more). Therefore, the compressor is uncoupled from the cooler. A system of valves (usually a <b>rotating</b> <b>valve)</b> alternatingly connects the high-pressure and the low-pressure side of the compressor to the hot end of the regenerator. As the high-temperature part of this type of PTR is the same as of GM-coolers this type of PTR is called a GM-type PTR. The gas flows through the valves are accompanied by losses which are absent in the Stirling-type PTR.|$|E
50|$|The said type of {{gate valve}} {{is having a}} {{rotating}} member inside a <b>rotating</b> <b>valve</b> chamber wherein {{the center of the}} valve chamber is off-set with the center line of the pumping cylinder and the pumping cylinder and the delivery pipe are on the same axis. Further the value of the off-set decides the thickness of the rotating member's sealing portion as it is provided a cut section equivalent to the diameter of the pumping cylinder. This invention eliminates the through hole design of the rotary valve and also introduces a replaceable cutting edge for the rotating member. Further this valve ensures that it displaces minimum concrete during its operation and ensures elimination of dead zones. Further the symmetrical design of the rotating member & the valve chamber allow the end user to repair the valve by using conventional means of machining such as a normal lathe machine. This impossible with S-tube valve or rock valve. This valve has been invented by Amit and Anand Gokhale.|$|E
5000|$|This {{engine was}} based on the Renault Cléon-Fonte engine from 1962. The Cléon-Fonte engine {{designed}} by engineer René Vuaillat is a small four -cylinder entirely new design, which appeared on the Renault Floride S and Renault 8 in 1962. Ford do Brasil inherited this engine upon buying the Brazilian Willys/Renault operation in the late 1960s. It has a total of eight overhead valves, and features a <b>rotating</b> <b>valve</b> design. The displacement of the original Cléon-Fonte used in Ford Corcel was 1,289 cc (73x77 mm bore and stroke); this was later raised to 1,372 cc (75.32x77 mm) for the [...] "XP" [...] engine, later called [...] "1300-B" [...] in single-carburetted form. The Cléon-Fonte was finally increased to 1,555 cc (77x83.5 mm) in 1979, which is also the displacement of the CHT. Ford do Brasil used the Cléon-Fonte engine until 1983, when they made a thorough redesign to the head and in the process renaming it the CHT. The Corcel-derived Ford Pampa pickup truck also used the Cléon-Fonte engine until replaced with the CHT in 1984.|$|E

50|$|Gifford-McMahon (GM) coolers {{have found}} {{widespread}} application in many low-temperature systems; e.g., in MRI and cryopumps. Fig. 5 is a schematic diagram. Helium at pressures in the 10 to 30 bar range is the working fluid. The cold head contains a compression and expansion space, a regenerator, and a displacer. Usually the regenerator and the displacer are combined in one body. The pressure {{variations in the}} cold head are obtained by connecting it periodically to the high- and low-pressure sides of a compressor by a <b>rotating</b> <b>valve.</b> Its position is synchronized with {{the motion of the}} displacer. During the opening and closing of the valves irreversible processes take place, so GM-coolers have intrinsic losses. This is a clear disadvantage of this type of cooler. The advantage is that the cycle frequencies of the compressor and the displacer are uncoupled so that the compressor can run at power-line frequency (50 or 60 Hz) while the cycle of the cold head is 1 Hz. In this way the swept volume of the compressor can be 50 (60) times smaller than of the cooler. Basically (cheap) compressors of domestic refrigerators can be used, but one must prevent overheating of the compressor as it is not designed for helium. One must also prevent oil vapor from entering the regenerator by high-quality purification traps.|$|E

40|$|The flow in {{turbocharger}} compressors and turbines for automotive {{engine application}} is highly unsteady in nature, as it {{responds to the}} intake and exhaust manifolds of the internal combustion engine. The optimization of the turbocharger system is therefore a very difficult task, since only steady flow maps are generally provided by turbocharger manufacturer. For several years a specialized components test facility operates at the University of Genoa, particularly suitable to test turbochargers under steady and unsteady flow conditions. The test bench has been continuously upgraded in order to study components under pulsating flow condition by using different layout configurations.

40|$|Magnetocaloric {{refrigeration}} is {{an alternative}} refrigeration technology with significant potential energy savings compared to conventional vapor compression refrigeration technology. Most of the reported active magnetic regenerator (AMR) systems that operate based on the magnetocaloric effect use heat transfer fluid to exchange heat, which results in complicated mechanical subsystems and components such as <b>rotating</b> <b>valves</b> and hydraulic pumps. In this paper, we propose an alternative mechanism for heat transfer between the AMR and the heat source/sink. High-conductivity moving rods/sheets (e. g. copper, brass, iron or aluminum) are utilized instead of heat transfer fluid significantly enhancing the heat transfer rate hence cooling/heating capacity. A one dimensional model is developed to study the solid state AMR. In this model, the heat exchange between the solid-solid interfaces is modeled via a contact conductance, which depends on the interface apparent pressure, material hardness, thermal conductivity, surface roughness, and surface slope between the interfaces. Due to the tremendous impact of the heat exchange on the AMR cycle performance, a sensitivity analysis is conducted employing a response surface method, in which the apparent pressure and effective surface roughness are the uncertainty factors. COP and refrigeration capacity are presented as the response in the sensitivity analysis to reveal the important factors influencing the fully solid state AMR and optimize the solid state AMR efficiency. The {{results of this study}} will provide general guidelines for designing high performance solid state AMR systems...|$|R

Numerous {{studies have been conducted}} to improve the convective heat transfer coefficient for a steady impinging jet. A pulsating jet has a very high potential in replacing steady jet after it been found able to increase the heat transfer coefficients at certain pulsating frequencies.

40|$|On-off {{control of}} {{hydraulic}} circuits enables {{significant improvements in}} efficiency compared with throttling valve control. A key enabling technology to on-off control is an efficient high-speed on-off valve. This paper documents the design of an on-off hydraulic valve that minimizes input power requirements and increases operating frequency over existing technology by utilizing a continuously <b>rotating</b> <b>valve</b> design. This is accomplished through use of spinning port discs, which divides the flow into pulses, with the relative phase between these discs determining the pulse duration. A mathematical model for determining system efficiency is developed {{with a focus on}} the throttling, leakage, compressibility, and viscous friction power losses of the valve. Parameters affecting these losses were optimized to produce the most efficient design under the chosen disc-style architecture. Using these optimum parameter values, a first generation prototype valve was developed and experimental data collected. The experimental valve matched predicted output pressure and flows well, but suffered from larger than expected torque requirements and leakage. In addition, due to motor limitations, the valve was only able to achieve a 64 Hz switching frequency versus the designed 100 Hz frequency. Future research will focus on improving the prototype valve and improving the analytical model based on the experimental results. ...|$|E
40|$|SYNOPSIS Hovercraft lift {{fans are}} {{subjected}} to varying back pressure due to wave action and craft motions when these vehicles are operating in a seaway. The oscillatory back pressure causes the fans to perform dynamically, exhibiting a hysteresis type of response and a corresponding degrada-tion in mean performance. Since hovercraft motions are influenced by variations in lift fan pressure and discharge, {{it is important to}} un-derstand completely the nature of the dynamic performance of lift fans in order to completely solve the hovercraft seakeeping problem. The present study was performed to determine and classify the insta-bilities encountered in a centrifugal fan operating against time-varying back pressure. A model-scale experiment was developed in which the fan discharge was directed into a flow-measuring device, terminating in a <b>rotating</b> <b>valve</b> which produced an oscillatory back pressure superimposed upon a mean aerodynamic resistance. Pressure and local velocity were measured as functions of time at several locations in the fan volute. The measurements permitted the identification of rotating (or propagating) stall in the impeller.

The mechanisms which lead to rotating stall in a centrifugal compressor are presented and discussed with specific reference to hovercraft applications...|$|E
25|$|A {{particular}} robustness {{issue is}} the requirement for a control system to perform properly {{in the presence of}} input and state constraints. In the physical world every signal is limited. It could happen that a controller will send control signals that cannot be followed by the physical system, for example, trying to <b>rotate</b> a <b>valve</b> at excessive speed. This can produce undesired behavior of the closed-loop system, or even damage or break actuators or other subsystems. Specific control techniques are available to solve the problem: model predictive control (see later), and anti-wind up systems. The latter consists of an additional control block that ensures that the control signal never exceeds a given threshold.|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{compressor}} surge imposes a significant limit on the flow range of a turbocharged internal combustion engine. The centrifugal compressor is commonly placed upstream of the inlet manifold and hence, it is exposed to the intermittent flow regime of the inlet valves. Surge phenomena has been well studied over the past decades, there still remains limited information with regards to the unsteady impact caused by the inlet valves. This study presents an experimental evaluation of such a situation. Engine representative pulses are created by a downstream system comprising a large volume, two <b>rotating</b> <b>valves,</b> a throttle valve and the corresponding pipe network. Different pulsation levels are characterized by means of their frequency and the corresponding amplitude at the compressor inlet. The stability limit of the system under study is evaluated with reference to the parameter B proposed by Greitzer [7 - 9]. B describes the dynamics of the compression system in terms of volume, area, equivalent length and compressor tip speed as well as the Helmholtz frequency of the system. For a given compressor, as B goes beyond a critical value, the system will exhibit surge {{as the result of the}} flow instability progression. The reduced frequency analysis shows that the scroll-diffuser operates in an unsteady regime, while the impeller is nearly quasi-steady. In the vicinity of the surge point, under a pulsating flow, the instantaneous operation of the compressor showed significant excursions into the unstable side of the surge line. Furthermore, it has been found that the presence of a volume in the system has the greatest effect on the surge margin of the compressor under the unsteady conditions...|$|R
