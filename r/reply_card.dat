5000|$|<b>Reply</b> <b>cards,</b> with {{or without}} postage, may be {{included}} with an invitation according to some etiquette writers, though they need not be. However, Judith Martin calls response cards [...] "vulgar", as they imply the guest would not reply without being prompted to do so. She advocates discarding them and replying on one's own stationery, while Peggy Post suggests that guests use them if included, to avoid interfering with the host's card collection system. Some say maps, directions, websites, and other information may be included. Others note {{that these are not}} formal aspects of an invitation, and therefore should not be included in formal invitations, and those who accept should instead later be sent the information via informal communication, such as postal mail, phone, or the internet. At-home cards may be included with wedding invitations. Traditionally, they announced the bride and groom's new address; they are now more likely to be used to announce the couple's choice of surnames.|$|R

5000|$|The receiver's {{particular}} type of reactions after seeing, hearing, or reading a message {{is known as a}} response. Receivers' responses can range from either non noticeable actions or noticeable actions. Non noticeable responses can be storing their information in memory and noticeable responses are immediate action such as dialing the commercials number to order a product advertised on television. One of the main goals of communication is receiving appropriate receiver responses, feedback closes the loop in the communications flow and lets the sender monitor how the intended message is being decoded and received. To achieve this goal one can ask indirectly or directly for the response, or assist the receiver in giving the response. [...] Receiving feed back can be more difficult for parties that advertise through the channels of mass media, because advertisers are not in direct contact with their customers so other methods must be obtained to determine how their messages have been received. While the critical form of feedback happens through sales, it is often hard to show a direct relationship between advertising and purchase behavior. So marketers; visit stores, check coupon redemption, use <b>reply</b> <b>cards</b> and listen to customer inquiries to achieve feedback. Once a significant amount of feedback/response study has been gathered advertisers would then have enough information to determine reasons for success or failure in the communication process and from there they can make appropriate adjustments.|$|R
5000|$|Following Switched-On Bach II, Carlos changed musical {{directions}} once more. In 1971, she and Elkind asked Columbia Records {{to attach}} a pre-paid business <b>reply</b> <b>card</b> in each new pressing of her albums, {{which resulted in a}} considerable amount of suggestions from the public regarding the subject of her future releases. The ideas received were divided; some asked for more classical adaptations, while others wanted more of Carlos' original compositions. Carlos decided, [...] "If I was going to spend months for mere minutes of music, I certainly wasn't going to be pigeonholed into only retreading existing music", and so began a process of [...] "re-directing new ideas, reworking old ones". By mid-1974, Carlos and Elkind had selected tracks of varying styles to record on the Moog synthesizer, which Carlos found liberating, as it demonstrated the flexibility of the instrument. Released as By Request in 1975, the album includes pieces from Bach, Wagner, Tchaikovsky, two of Carlos' compositions from the 1960s, and renditions of [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] by The Beatles and [...] "What's New Pussycat?", originally sung by Tom Jones. The final track, a [...] "witty and serious" [...] set of variations based on themes by Edward Elgar, was replaced with tracks from The Well-Tempered Synthesizer on UK pressings after members of Elgar's estate refused to have his music presented in a less than serious light, which [...] "devastated" [...] Carlos. By Request was followed by Switched-On Brandenburgs, a double album containing all six of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos played on a synthesizer, in 1979.|$|E
40|$|Non-response to mailed surveys {{reduces the}} {{effective}} sample size and may introduce bias. Non-response has been studied by (1) comparison to available data in population based registers, (2) directly contacting non-respondents by telephone or single-item reply cards, and (3) longitudinal repetition of the survey. The goal {{of this paper was}} to propose an additional method to study non-response bias: when the variable of interest has a familial component, data from respondents can be used as proxy for the data from their non-responding family members. This approach was used with data on smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, coffee- and tea-use, education, body mass index, religion, burnout, life events, personality and mental health in large number of siblings and DZ twins registered with the Netherlands Twin Register. In addition, for smoking behavior, we also used the second strategy by sending a <b>reply</b> <b>card.</b> Results show that scores of members from less cooperative families or incomplete twin pairs tended to be more unfavorable than the scores from highly cooperative families or complete twin pairs. For example, family members from less cooperative families cycled less often and scored higher on anxious depression and neuroticism. For smoking, both the results of the <b>reply</b> <b>card</b> and the results of the additional method suggested a higher percentage smokers among the non-respondents but this was only significant with <b>reply</b> <b>card</b> method. In general, differences between highly/less cooperative families and complete/incomplete DZ twins were small. Results suggest that, even for studies with moderate response rates, data collected on health, personality and lifestyle are relatively unbiased. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Today, {{more and}} more health {{professionals}} use the Internet to deliver behavioral change interventions, because of its advantage to reach {{a wide variety of}} people at low costs. However, little is known about who is interested in and actually participates in such website-delivered programs. Therefore, the purpose of this manuscript was to examine the characteristics of participants and non-participants (parents recruited through schools) in a computer-tailored physical activity intervention delivered through the Internet. Methods Data was collected in two ways. First, 5706 brochures with a call to participate in a physical activity program, with as key element a website-delivered tailored physical activity advice, were distributed indirectly (through their ildren) to parents of all pupils in 14 primary and secondary schools in Belgium. Parents were asked to return the <b>reply</b> <b>card</b> mentioning if they wanted to participate or not. Second, characteristics of participating and non-participating parents were collected by distributing 2000 short questionnaires to pupils between 10 – 18 years of age, in 12 of the 14 schools. Chi-square analysis and binary logistic regressions were used to compare characteristics of those parents who showed interest (i. e. positive response on <b>reply</b> <b>card)</b> or actually participated (completed online assessment) in a website-delivered physical activity intervention with the characteristics of those parents who showed no interest or did not participate. Results In total 1730 pupils (87 % respondents), completed the short questionnaire concerning their parents' age, occupation (to derive the socio-economic status) and physical activity habits. The results of the binary logistic regression showed that mothers were more likely to show interest (Odds Ratio (OR) = 1. 68, p Conclusion Both younger and older adults as well as physically active and inactive people participated in our online computer-tailored physical activity program when recruitment was done through schools. However, other health-education programs are still needed to reach all segments of the population equally. </p...|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, {{commercial}} food {{equipment manufacturers}} are producing products that operate using electronic touch controls and microprocessors {{to assist in}} the production of food. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine if impediments of the transfer of information in the care, maintenance and most importantly use and operation of technologically advanced food service equipment exist. And, if in fact they do, what can be done to eliminate these impediments. It is the opinion of the author that there may lie an inherent rift between the advancement of technology on food service equipment and either the training that accompanies such equipment or skill level of today s food service worker. A 13 question survey instrument has been developed and administered via telephone interview to 50 respondents of which 46 participated resulting in a 92 % response rate. The 46 respondents were selected from business <b>reply</b> <b>cards</b> that were included in electronically controlled food service equipment that they had purchased. This alleviated the possibility that any of the respondents were not familiar with this type of equipment and guaranteed that their answers were to be germane to the study. Data and statistical analysis have been collated by Minitab, a statistical analysis program, and its outcome can be found in the Findings and Analysis section of this study. From the sample of 46 participants, the survey showed that the average respondent was: 30 to 34 years of age, has had some college, in a middle management position, has been involved in the food service industry for 11 to 15 years, operates an ethnic theme restaurant, operates cooking equipment that has electronic touch controls, has had some form of training on the equipment with electronic touch controls, were trained at the place of business and were predominantly self-trained. The study recommends that operators of commercial food service equipment that has electronic touch controls be familiar with them and the current methods of training for them as these advancements are likely to become more complex as the equipment industry progresses...|$|R
40|$|Ethnic {{minority}} {{women from}} low-income countries {{who live in}} high-income countries are more physically inactive than ethnic majority women in those countries. At the same time, they can be harder to reach with health promotion programs. Targeting recruitment channels and execution to ethnic groups could increase reach and receptivity to program participation. We explored using ethnically specific channels and key figures to reach Ghanaian, Antillean, and Surinamese mothers with an invitation for an exercise program, and subsequently, to determine the mothers' receptivity and participation. We conducted a mixed methods process evaluation in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. To recruit mothers, we employed ethnically specific community organizations and ethnically matched key figures as recruiters over Dutch health educators. Reach and participation were measured using <b>reply</b> <b>cards</b> and the attendance records from the exercise programs. Observations were made of the recruitment process. We interviewed 14 key figures and 32 mothers {{to respond to the}} recruitment channel and recruiter used. Content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data. Recruitment through ethnically specific community channels was successful among Ghanaian mothers, but less so among Antillean and Surinamese mothers. The more close-knit an ethnic community was, retaining their own culture and having poorer comprehension of the Dutch language, the more likely we were to reach mothers through ethnically specific organizations. Furthermore, we found that using ethnically matched recruiters resulted in higher receptivity to the program and, among the Ghanaian mothers in particular, in greater participation. This was because the ethnically matched recruiter was a familiar, trusted person, a translator, and a motivator who was enthusiastic, encouraging, and able to adapt her message (targeting/tailoring). Using a health expert was preferred in order to increase the credibility and professionalism of the recruitment. Recruitment for an exercise program through ethnically specific organizations seems to contribute to its reach, particularly in close-knit, highly organized ethnic communities with limited fluency in the local language. Using ethnically matched recruiters as motivator, translator, and trusted person seems to enhance receptivity of a health promotion program. An expert is likely to be needed for effective information deliver...|$|R

40|$|Purpose To {{perform a}} process {{evaluation}} of {{the implementation of a}} workplace integrated care intervention for workers with rheumatoid arthritis to maintain and improve work productivity. The intervention consisted of integrated care and a participatory workplace intervention with the aim to make adaptations at the workplace. Methods The implementation of the workplace integrated care intervention was evaluated with the framework of Linnan and Steckler. We used the concepts recruitment, reach, dose delivered, dose received, fidelity and satisfaction with the intervention. Data collection occurred through patient questionnaires and medical records. Results Participants were recruited by sending a letter including a <b>reply</b> <b>card</b> from their own rheumatologist. In total, we invited 1973 patients to participate. We received 1184 reply cards, and of these, 150 patients eventually participated in the study. Integrated care was delivered according to protocol for 46. 7 %, while the participatory workplace intervention was delivered for 80. 6 %. Dose received was nearly 70 %, which means that participants implemented 70 % of the workplace adaptations proposed during the participatory workplace intervention. The fidelity score for both integrated care and the participatory workplace intervention was sufficient, although communication between members of the multidisciplinary team was limited. Participants were generally satisfied with the intervention. Conclusions This process evaluation shows that our intervention was not entirely implemented as intended.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{constraints}} to agricultural research in the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries, is access to current and relevant information {{in the form of}} primary documents, secondary services, machine-readable databases, etc. Progress is hindered or prevented by a variety of factors such as shortage of foreign exchange to purchase primary literature or photocopies, poor communication and resource sharing within national agricultural research systems, lack of awareness of existing information resources and scarcity of qualified information specialists to use information services and resources adequately, and the general low priority given to information-related activities in research budgets. To keep researchers updated on the literature available in their field of research, the target of any information service should be for each researcher or team of researchers to receive current awareness bibliographies with abstracts on a regular basis and, if they do not already have this, a retrospective bibliography in their field of research. The challenge is to make the distribution of this information as effective and efficient as possible. In recognition of the problems and requirements described, CTA launched an SDI pilot project in 1988 together with the Centre de Coop 9 ration Internationale en Recherche Agronomique pour le D 9 veloppement (CIRAD) in ACP countries in Africa. In 1991 it was extended to all 69 ACP countries with the additional support of CAB International (CABI). This service took off slowly because of difficulties in obtaining specific information about the latest research activities at the national level, the researchers in charge, and existing information resources. The objective of the SDI programme is to allow a researcher to keep abreast with the latest scientific and technical information relevant to his or her field of research by regularly providing information of specific interest. Each potential beneficiary fills in specially designed forms outlining his or her own research programme, a list of 'KEYWORDS' to describe the subject of interest and the subscriber's address. The service aims at providing a minimum of four personal (individual) profiles per country. In addition, ACP countries are divided into six regions and each region is targeted to receive a minimum of 100 profiles on at least 10 subjects of broad interest. As it is beyond the resources of most researchers in the ACP countries to purchase all the documents they identify, the service allows each beneficiary to receive a limited number of selected publications from the bibliographies. This acts as a starting point from which the researchers can trace the latest scientific and technical publications relevant to their work. To ensure the success of the service in terms of timeliness, appropriateness and usefulness, it is monitored continuously by means of quick-response <b>reply</b> <b>cards</b> supplied to the beneficiaries. This allows adjustment and improvement of the project in order to prepare the general evaluation which will be done in 1994. The day-to-day management of the SDI services is handled by the Centre International de Documentation en Agronomie des R 9 gions Chaudes (CIRARC/CIRAD) and CAB International (CABI).

40|$|BACKGROUND: People {{want to be}} well {{informed}} and ask for more information regarding their health. The public can use different sources (i. e. the Internet, health care providers, friends, family, television, radio, and newspapers) to access information about their health. Insight into the types and sources of vaccine related information that parents use, and reasons why they seek extra information is needed to improve the existing information supply about childhood vaccinations. METHODS: Dutch parents {{with one or more}} children aged 0 - 4 years received an online questionnaire (N= 4, 000) measuring psychosocial determinants of information-seeking behaviour and self-reports of types and sources of vaccine information searched for (response rate 14. 8 %). We also tested two invitation approaches (i. e., <b>reply</b> <b>card</b> versus Internet link in invitation letter) to observe the difference in response rate. RESULTS: Almost half of the parents (45. 8 %) searched for extra information. Of all the respondents, 13 % indicated they had missed some information, particularly about side effects of vaccines (25 %). Intention to search for vaccination information was influenced by positive attitude and perceived social norm towards information-seeking behaviour. There was no difference in the response rate between the two invitation approaches. CONCLUSIONS: The information provided by the National Immunization Programme (NIP) might be sufficient for most parents. However, some parents mentioned that they did not receive enough information about side effects of vaccinations, which was also the topic most searched for by parents. Public Health Institutes (PHIs) and child healthcare workers should therefore be aware of the importance to mention this aspect in their communication (materials) towards parents. The PHIs must ensure that their website is easy to find with different search strategies. Since the child healthcare worker is perceived as the most reliable information source, they should be aware of their role in educating parents about the NIP...|$|E

40|$|Background: Improving {{questionnaire}} {{response rates}} is an everlasting issue for research. Today, the Internet {{can easily be}} used to collect data quickly. However, collecting data on the Internet can lead to biased samples because not everyone is able to access or use the Internet. The older population, for example, is {{much less likely to}} use the Internet. The Patient-Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and Long-Term Evaluation of Survivorship (PROFILES) registry offers a platform to collect Web-based and paper questionnaires and to try different measures to improve response rates. Objective: In this study, our aim was to study the influence of two methods of invitation on the response rate. Our second aim was to examine the preference of questionnaire mode of administration (paper or Web-based) for the older patient in particular. Methods: To test these two invitational methods, 3406 colorectal cancer patients between ages 18 and 85 years received an invitation containing an access code for the Web-based questionnaire. They could also request a paper questionnaire with an included <b>reply</b> <b>card</b> (paper-optional group). In contrast, 179 randomly selected colorectal cancer patients received a paper questionnaire with the invitation (paper-included group). They could also choose to fill out the Web-based questionnaire with the included access code. Results: Response rates did not differ between the paper-optional and the paper-included groups (73. 14 %, 2491 / 3406 and 74. 9 %, 134 / 179, P=. 57). In the paper-optional group, online response was significantly higher when compared to the paper-included group (41. 23 %, 1027 / 2491 vs 12. 7 %, 17 / 134, P<. 001). The majority of online respondents responded after the first invitation (95. 33 %, 979 / 1027), which was significantly higher than the paper respondents (52. 19 %, 764 / 1464, P<. 001). Respondents aged 70 years and older chose to fill out a paper questionnaire more often (71. 0 %, 677 / 954). In the oldest age group (≥ 80 years), 18. 2 % (61 / 336) of the respondents filled out a Web-based questionnaire. Conclusions: The lack of difference in response rates between invitation modes implies that researchers can leave out a paper questionnaire at invitation without lowering response rates. It may be preferable not to include a paper questionnaire because more respondents then will fill out a Web-based questionnaire, which will lead to faster available data. However, due to respondent preference, it is not likely that paper questionnaires can be left out completely in the near future.

40|$|Victoria Hospital, Belfast, as {{at other}} hospitals, the {{operation}} of tubal ligation is being performed more readily and in greater numbers than previously. In 1963 fifteen were done, in 1967, one hundred and twenty-six. It is becoming less a matter of medical necessity and {{more a matter of}} personal choice and it was therefore thought that {{it would be interesting to}} follow up the women who had had this operation performed. The primary interest has not been in the techniques of operation and their relative efficacy but in patient reaction to the operation, including how well prepared by previous discussion the patient and her husband were, whether any regrets were experienced and whether there were any differences noted afterwards in the circumstances of the woman, the couple or the family. METHODS AND MATERIAL The details of past history and operation were extracted from patient records and each patient was written to a year or more after operation and asked to come to hospital for interview. If she did not <b>reply</b> on the <b>card</b> provided she was sent a second appointment and if there was again no reply the local health visitor called o...|$|R
40|$|At {{the very}} outset, let me {{anticipate}} {{and respond to}} the question, viz., why is Infogix sponsoring this research project on continuous monitoring? The obvious answer is that Infogix has been a proud strategic partner of Financial Executives International (FEI). Further, this subject is of great interest to the members of FEI as well as to Infogix and its clients. Another telling answer emerges from an anecdote from this study itself. When asked if there is value in deploying a single, automated continuous monitoring solution that can monitor financial controls, data quality controls, financial reconciliations, risks and business pertormance across all business areas of the organization, Pam Oberdiek, Senior Project Manager at Hallmark <b>Cards</b> <b>replied,</b> “But that would be motherhood and apple pie! Who will not want that if it exists? ” Another good answer to why Infogix sponsored this research follows quite naturally — we are continuous monitoring advocates who {{are in the business of}} creating “motherhood and apple pie” continuous monitoring solutions. In this era of ever increasing regulation, operational risk and decreasing operational margins, the one thing that most businesses agree on is the need for operationa...|$|R
5000|$|Bligh, in What's the Use of Lectures?, {{argues that}} lectures [...] "represent a {{conception}} of education in which teachers who know give knowledge to {{students who do not}} and are therefore supposed to have nothing worth contributing." [...] Based on his review of numerous studies, he concludes that lecturing is as effective, but not more effective, as any other teaching method in transmitting information. Nevertheless, lecturing is not the most effective method for promoting student thought, changing attitudes, or teaching behavioral skills.Bligh summarises research on memory to show the significance of the meaningfulness of material on retention (Marks and Miller 1964) and the importance of immediate rehearsal of information (Bassey 1968). He relates his own research on arousal during lectures to suggest a decrement in attention during the first 25 minutes. Lloyd (1968) and Scerbo et al. (1992) showed that students take less and less notes as lectures proceed. Bligh shows that after a short break filled by buzz group discussion, attention will recover somewhat. The largest section of Bligh's book is devoted to lecturing technique, particularly the organisation of lectures, how to make a point, the effectiveness of taking notes, the use of handouts, and ways of obtaining feedback.Early editions of the book contained a <b>reply</b> paid evaluation <b>card.</b> This research showed that the section on alternative teaching methods within lectures was the most highly praised.|$|R
