5|$|Adventure 2 has {{the health}} system found in many other Sonic games. The player {{collects}} <b>rings</b> scattered throughout the levels; being hit by an enemy while holding <b>rings</b> causes the player to drop them all, while being hit without <b>rings</b> causes them to lose a life. Tails and Eggman have the customary health bar, which is slowly refilled by collecting <b>rings.</b> Dying with no lives results in a game over screen. The characters can obtain permanent upgrades that grant them new abilities; for example, one allows Sonic and Shadow to dash along a sequential trail of <b>rings</b> to reach distant platforms, while another lets Knuckles and Rouge attack powerfully enough to break certain containers. Chaos Drives {{can be used with}} the player's Chao (small, anthropomorphic animals).|$|E
5|$|After the ε ring, the α and β <b>rings</b> are the {{brightest}} of Uranus's <b>rings.</b> Like the ε ring, they exhibit regular variations in brightness and width. They are brightest and widest 30° from the apoapsis and dimmest and narrowest 30° from the periapsis. The α and β <b>rings</b> have sizable orbital eccentricity and non-negligible inclination. The widths of these <b>rings</b> are 4.8–10km and 6.1–11.4km, respectively. The equivalent optical depths are 3.29km and 2.14km, resulting in normal optical depths of 0.3–0.7 and 0.2–0.35, respectively. During a ring plane-crossing event in 2007 the <b>rings</b> disappeared, {{which means they}} are geometrically thin like the ε ring and devoid of dust. However, the same event revealed a thick and optically thin dust band just outside the β ring, which was also observed earlier by Voyager 2. The masses of the α and β <b>rings</b> {{are estimated to be}} about 5kg (each)—half the mass of the ε ring.|$|E
5|$|As a whole, {{the ring}} system of Uranus is unlike either the faint dusty <b>rings</b> of Jupiter or the broad and complex <b>rings</b> of Saturn, {{some of which}} are {{composed}} of very bright material—water ice. However, there are similarities with some parts of the latter ring system; the Saturnian F ring and the Uranian ε ring are both narrow, relatively dark and are shepherded by a pair of moons. The newly discovered outer ν and μ <b>rings</b> of Uranus are similar to the outer G and E <b>rings</b> of Saturn. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian <b>rings</b> also resemble the narrow <b>rings</b> of Uranus. In addition, dust bands observed between the main <b>rings</b> of Uranus may be similar to the <b>rings</b> of Jupiter. In contrast, the Neptunian ring system is quite similar to that of Uranus, although it is less complex, darker and contains more dust; the Neptunian <b>rings</b> are also positioned further from the planet.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, a clean <b>ring</b> is a <b>ring</b> {{in which}} every element can be written as the sum of a unit and an idempotent. A <b>ring</b> is a local <b>ring</b> {{if and only if}} it is clean and has no idempotents other than 0 and 1. The {{endomorphism}} <b>ring</b> of a continuous module is a clean <b>ring.</b> Every clean <b>ring</b> is an exchange <b>ring.</b> A matrix <b>ring</b> over a clean <b>ring</b> is itself clean.|$|R
50|$|Any {{quotient}} of a <b>ring</b> by a maximal {{ideal is}} a simple <b>ring.</b> In particular, a field {{is a simple}} <b>ring.</b> In fact a division <b>ring</b> is also a simple <b>ring.</b> A <b>ring</b> is simple if and only its opposite <b>ring</b> Ro is simple.|$|R
50|$|In {{commutative}} algebra, a J-0 <b>ring</b> is a <b>ring</b> {{such that}} the set of regular points of the spectrum contains a non-empty open subset, a J-1 <b>ring</b> is a <b>ring</b> {{such that the}} set of regular points of the spectrum is an open subset, and a J-2 <b>ring</b> is a <b>ring</b> such that any finitely generated algebra over the <b>ring</b> is a J-1 <b>ring.</b>|$|R
5|$|As with {{previous}} Sonic games, Sonic 3 uses <b>rings,</b> {{scattered throughout the}} levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without <b>rings,</b> is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a life {{and return to the}} most recently passed checkpoint. Dying with zero lives gives the player a game over. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an extra life, temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of <b>rings,</b> a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby <b>rings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beyond {{the main}} <b>rings</b> at a {{distance}} of 12 million km from the planet is the sparse Phoebe ring, which is tilted at an angle of 27° to the other <b>rings</b> and, like Phoebe, orbits in retrograde fashion.|$|E
5|$|By 1978, nine {{distinct}} <b>rings</b> were identified. Two additional <b>rings</b> {{were discovered}} in 1986 in images taken by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, and two outer <b>rings</b> were found in 2003–2005 in Hubble Space Telescope photos. In the order of increasing distance from the planet the 13 known <b>rings</b> are designated 1986U2R/ζ, 6, 5, 4, α, β, η, γ, δ, λ, ε, ν and μ. Their radii range from about 38,000km for the 1986U2R/ζ ring to about 98,000km for the μ ring. Additional faint dust bands and incomplete arcs may exist between the main <b>rings.</b> The <b>rings</b> are extremely dark—the Bond albedo of the rings' particles does not exceed 2%. They are probably composed of water ice {{with the addition of}} some dark radiation-processed organics.|$|E

40|$|A clean <b>ring</b> is one {{in which}} every element is a sum of an {{idempotent}} and a unit. It is shown that every <b>ring</b> can be embedded in a clean <b>ring</b> as an essential <b>ring</b> extension. It is seen that the centre of a clean <b>ring</b> need not be a clean <b>ring.</b> There is no “clean hull” of a <b>ring.</b> A family of examples is given where there is a <b>ring</b> R, not a clean <b>ring,</b> embedded in a commutative clean <b>ring</b> S so that there is no clean <b>ring</b> T, R T S, minimal with that property. It is also shown that a commutative pm <b>ring</b> (each prime ideal is contained in a unique maximal ideal) cannot be extended to a clean <b>ring</b> by the adjunction of finitely many central idempotents...|$|R
5|$|Commutative algebra makes great use of <b>rings</b> of polynomials in one {{or several}} variables, {{introduced}} above. Their multiplication is both commutative and associative. These <b>rings</b> and their quotients {{form the basis of}} algebraic geometry, because they are <b>rings</b> of functions of algebraic geometric objects.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{that the}} <b>rings</b> might have gaps first arose during a stellar {{occultation}} in 1984 when the <b>rings</b> obscured {{a star on}} immersion but not on emersion. Images from Voyager 2 in 1989 settled the issue by showing several faint <b>rings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the planet Saturn, {{and at first}} mistook its <b>rings</b> for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system. When he {{observed the}} planet later, Saturn's <b>rings</b> were directly oriented at Earth, causing him to think {{that two of the}} bodies had disappeared. The <b>rings</b> reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further confusing him.|$|E
25|$|A {{division}} <b>ring</b> is a <b>ring</b> {{such that}} every non-zero element is a unit. A commutative division <b>ring</b> is a field. A prominent {{example of a}} division <b>ring</b> {{that is not a}} field is the <b>ring</b> of quaternions. Any centralizer in a division <b>ring</b> is also a division <b>ring.</b> In particular, the center of a division <b>ring</b> is a field. It turned out that every finite domain (in particular finite division <b>ring)</b> is a field; in particular commutative (the Wedderburn's little theorem).|$|R
40|$|The aims of this {{research}} was to construct a clean <b>ring</b> from any <b>ring.</b>   The base on the fact  that the endomorphism <b>ring</b> of every pure-injective module is clean, it was constructed a clean <b>ring</b> from any <b>ring.</b> So, the result of {{this research}} was it always could be constructed a clean <b>ring</b> from any <b>ring...</b>|$|R
5000|$|If A is a nonzero <b>ring,</b> {{then there}} is no <b>ring</b> {{homomorphism}} from the zero <b>ring</b> to A. In particular, the zero <b>ring</b> is not a subring of any nonzero <b>ring.</b>|$|R
5|$|Horse <b>rings,</b> {{often made}} of iron or brass, are {{remnants}} from the 1800s, when horses, and horse-drawn vehicles, provided the primary mode of transportation. In 1978, The Register-Guard {{suggested that the}} <b>rings</b> might only be {{as old as the}} early 1900s. The <b>rings</b> allowed residents to tether their horses to sidewalks.|$|E
5|$|Horse <b>rings,</b> {{remnants}} {{of a time when}} horses and horse-drawn vehicles provided the primary mode of transportation, can be found throughout Portland, Oregon. They were removed from curbs and sidewalks for safety purposes until the late 1970s, when one Portland resident complained about the <b>rings</b> disappearing. Today, the city of Portland helps to preserve the <b>rings</b> by requiring them to be replaced following sidewalk construction or repair.|$|E
5|$|In 2003–2005, the Hubble Space Telescope {{detected}} {{a pair of}} previously unknown <b>rings,</b> now called the outer ring system, which brought the number of known Uranian <b>rings</b> to 13. These <b>rings</b> were subsequently named the μ and ν <b>rings.</b> The μ ring is the outermost of the pair, and is twice {{the distance from the}} planet as the bright η ring. The outer <b>rings</b> differ from the inner narrow <b>rings</b> in a number of respects. They are broad, 17,000and 3,800km wide, respectively, and very faint. Their peak normal optical depths are 8.5×10−6 and 5.4×10−6, respectively. The resulting equivalent optical depths are 0.14km and 0.012km. The <b>rings</b> have triangular radial brightness profiles.|$|E
50|$|If a is {{idempotent}} in the <b>ring</b> R, then aRa {{is again}} a <b>ring,</b> with multiplicative identity a. The <b>ring</b> aRa {{is often referred}} to as a corner <b>ring</b> of R. The corner <b>ring</b> arises naturally since the <b>ring</b> of endomorphisms EndR(aR) ≅ aRa.|$|R
50|$|The {{definition}} of the exp <b>ring</b> of G {{is similar to that}} of the group <b>ring</b> ZG of G, which is the universal <b>ring</b> such that there is an exponential homomorphism from the group to its units. In particular there is a natural homomorphism from the group <b>ring</b> to a completion of the exp <b>ring.</b> However in general the Exp <b>ring</b> can be much larger than the group ring: for example, the group <b>ring</b> of the integers is the <b>ring</b> of Laurent polynomials in 1 variable, while the exp <b>ring</b> is a polynomial <b>ring</b> in countably many generators.|$|R
40|$|A {{telemetry}} carrier <b>ring</b> {{for use in}} a {{gas turbine}} engine includes an annular support <b>ring</b> connected to the engine and an annular carrier <b>ring</b> coupled to the support <b>ring,</b> each <b>ring</b> exhibiting different growth characteristics in response to thermal and mechanical loading. The carrier <b>ring</b> is coupled to the support <b>ring</b> by a plurality of circumferentially spaced web members which are relatively thin in an engine radial direction to provide a predetermined degree of radial flexibility. the web members have a circumferential width and straight axial line of action selected to transfer torque and thrust between the support <b>ring</b> and the carrier <b>ring</b> without substantial deflection. The use of the web members with radial flexibility provides compensation between the support <b>ring</b> and the carrier <b>ring</b> since the carrier <b>ring</b> grows at a different rate than the supporting <b>ring...</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the flag of Artsakh, the Armenian flag colors influenced {{the design of the}} Pan-Armenian Games flag. In the center of the light blue flag are six interlocking <b>rings,</b> derived from the Olympic <b>rings.</b> The sixth, orange-colored ring, interlocks with the blue and red <b>rings,</b> which symbolize Armenia. Above the <b>rings</b> is a flame in the colors of the Armenian flag.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the 2004 {{arrival of}} the Cassini–Huygens spacecraft, the <b>rings</b> of Saturn were widely thought to be much younger than the Solar System and were not {{expected}} to survive beyond another 300million years. Gravitational interactions with Saturn's moons were expected to gradually sweep the rings' outer edge toward the planet, with abrasion by meteorites and Saturn's gravity eventually taking the rest, leaving Saturn unadorned. However, data from the Cassini mission led scientists to revise that early view. Observations revealed 10km-wide icy clumps of material that repeatedly break apart and reform, keeping the <b>rings</b> fresh. Saturn's <b>rings</b> are far more massive than the <b>rings</b> of the other giant planets. This large mass {{is thought to have}} preserved Saturn's <b>rings</b> since it first formed 4.5billion years ago, and is likely to preserve them for billions of years to come.|$|E
5|$|Scattered {{around each}} level are gold <b>rings.</b> Collecting 100 <b>rings</b> rewards the player {{with an extra}} life. <b>Rings</b> act as a layer of {{protection}} against hazards: if Sonic holds at least one ring when he collides with an enemy or dangerous obstacle, he will survive.

Shields and temporary invincibility can be collected to provide additional layers of protection, but certain hazards, such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time, will cause Sonic to lose a life regardless of <b>rings</b> or other protection.|$|E
