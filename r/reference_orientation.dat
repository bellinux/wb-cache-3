Most of the thesis is devoted to a theoretical formulation in which <b>reference</b> group <b>orientation</b> and ethnocentrism are placed in a peroeptual framework. <b>Reference</b> group <b>orientation</b> {{is defined as a}} person 2 ̆ 7 s use of a frame of reference that is formed through adoption of a reference group 2 ̆ 7 s perspective.

The acceptance of the viability of other cultural frames of reference is defined as ethnorelativism.

The incremental {{nature of this}} measurement is subject to drift that accumulates to large errors in the position estimate.

Take a sphere of unit radius, for example, a ping-pong ball, and mark one point B in blue. Corresponding to this point is a diameter of the sphere, and the plane orthogonal to this diameter positioned at the center C of the sphere defines a great circle called the equator associated with point B. On this equator, select another point R and mark it in red. Position the sphere on the z = 0 plane such that the point B is coincident with the origin, C is located at x = 0, y = 0, z = 1, and R is located at x = 1, y = 0, and z = 1, i.e. R extends {{in the direction of}} the positive x axis.

40|$|Observers {{can better}} {{discriminate}} orientation or direction near the cardinal axes than near an oblique axis. We investigated whether this well-known oblique effect {{is determined by}} the physical or the perceived axis of the stimuli. Using the simultaneous tilt illusion, we generated perceptually different orientations for the same inner (target) grating by contrasting it with differently oriented outer gratings. Subjects compared the target orientation with a set of <b>reference</b> <b>orientations.</b> If orientation discriminability was determined by the physical orientations, the psychometric curves for the same target grating would be identical. Instead, all subjects produced steeper curves when perceiving target gratings near vertically as opposed to more obliquely. This result of orientation discrimination was confirmed by using adaptation-generated tilt aftereffect to manipulate the perceived orientation of a given physical orientation. Moreover, we obtained the same result in direction discrimination by using motion repulsion to alter the perceived direction of a given physical direction. We conclude that when the perceived orientation or direction differs from the physical orientation or direction, the oblique effect depends on perceived, rather than physical, orientation or direction. Finally, as a by-product of the study, we found that, around the vertical direction, motion repulsion is much stronger when the inducing direction is more clockwise to the test direction than when it is more counterclockwise...|$|R

40|$|A robust {{fingerprint}} recognition algorithm should {{tolerate the}} rotation and {{translation of the}} fingerprint image. One popular solution is to consistently detect a unique reference point and compute a unique <b>reference</b> <b>orientation</b> for translational and rotational alignment. This paper develops an effective algorithm to locate a reference point and compute the corresponding <b>reference</b> <b>orientation</b> consistently and accurately {{for all types of}} fingerprints. To compute the reliable orientation field, an improved orientation smoothing method is proposed based on adaptive neighborhood. It shows better performance in filtering noise while maintaining the orientation localization than the conventional averaging method. The reference-point localization is based on multiscale analysis of the orientation consistency to search the local minimum. The unique <b>reference</b> <b>orientation</b> is computed based on the analysis of the orientation differences between the radial directions from the reference point, which are the directions of the radii emitted from the reference point with equivalent angle interval, and the local ridge orientations along these radii. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can consistently locate a unique reference point and compute the <b>reference</b> <b>orientation</b> with high accuracy for all types of fingerprints. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{apparent}} {{spatial orientation}} {{of an object}} can differ from its physical orientation when differently oriented objects surround it.

Series B, Biological Sciences, 273, 2681 - 2686], we reported a loss of orientation acuity whenever a large physical tilt was required {{to compensate for the}} tilt illusion and make a target appear horizontal.

In the present study, we used oblique (i. e. neither horizontal nor vertical) <b>reference</b> <b>orientations</b> to more directly examine the effect of perceived orientation on orientation acuity. The results show that when surround and reference were parallel, there was no tilt illusion and acuity was high.

40|$|Abstract—A lot of {{matching}} algorithms with different characteristics {{have been introduced}} in recent years. For real time systems these algorithms are usually based on minutiae features. In this paper we introduce a novel approach for feature extraction in which the extracted features are independent of shift and rotation of the fingerprint and at the meantime the matching operation is performed much more easily and with higher speed and accuracy. In this new approach first for any fingerprint a reference point and a <b>reference</b> <b>orientation</b> is determined and then based on this information features are converted into polar coordinates. Due to high speed and accuracy of this approach and small volume of extracted features and easily execution {{of matching}} operation this approach is the most appropriate for real time applications.

40|$|In this thesis, a novel {{method for}} local feature {{description}} where local features are grouped in normalized support regions with the intensity orders is proposed. Local features extracted using {{this kind of}} method are not only gives advantage of invariant to rotation and illumination changes, but also converts the image information into the descriptor. These features are calculated with different ways, one is based on gradient and other one {{is based on the}} intensity order. Local features calculated by the method of the gradient performs well in most of the cases such as blur, rotation and large illuminations and it overcome the problem of orientation estimation which is the major error source for false negatives in SIFT. In order to overcome mismatching problem, method of multiple support regions are introduced in the proposed method instead of using single support region which performs better than the single support region, even though single support region is better than SIFT. The idea of intensity order pooling is inherently rotational invariant without estimating a <b>reference</b> <b>orientation.</b> Experimental results show that the idea of intensity order pooling is efficient than the other descriptors, which are based on estimated <b>reference</b> <b>orientation</b> for rotational invariance...|$|E
