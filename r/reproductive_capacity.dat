With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind their <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E

Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to discount the importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E
5|$|Only a few shark {{attacks of}} {{uncertain}} provenance {{have been attributed}} to the porbeagle. It is well regarded as a game fish by recreational anglers. The meat and fins of the porbeagle are highly valued, which has led to a long history of intense human exploitation. However, this species cannot sustain heavy fishing pressure due to its low <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity.</b> Direct commercial fishing for the porbeagle, principally by Norwegian longliners, led to stock collapses in the eastern North Atlantic in the 1950s, and the western North Atlantic in the 1960s. The porbeagle continues to be caught throughout its range, both intentionally and as bycatch, with varying degrees of monitoring and management. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the porbeagle as Vulnerable worldwide, and as either Endangered or Critically Endangered in different parts of its northern range.|$|E

25|$|That is, since a {{high number}} of deaths are {{required}} to fix one gene rapidly, and dead organisms do not reproduce, fixation of more than one gene simultaneously would conflict. Note that Haldane's model assumes independence of genes at different loci; if the selection intensity is 0.1 for each gene moving towards fixation, and there are N such genes, then the <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> of the species will be lowered to 0.9N times the original capacity.

25|$|A {{study of}} the {{seasonal}} abundance of B. giganteus juveniles and adults suggests a peak in <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> {{in the spring and}} winter months. This is observed to be due to a shortage of food during the summer. Mature females develop a brood pouch or marsupium when sexually active, the pouch being formed by overlapping oostegites or brood plates grown from the medial border of the pereiopods. The young isopods emerge from the marsupium as miniatures of the adults, known as mancae. This is not a larval stage: the mancae are fully developed, lacking only the last pair of pereiopods.|$|E
25|$|Recently emerged {{individual}} young wasps {{have black}} or brown eyes, while older individuals have pink eyes and grow wings to fly.

Also, the emerging young B. petiolata body sizes increase from January through March, which {{is the end of}} adult emergence. Since worker production extends until the end of January, workers arising this month were bigger in size than those born in the earlier part of the season, around November and December.

In {{relation to their}} size, these species have high <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacities</b> and thus conform to the general character of species of intermittently available habitats. Experimental evidence indicates that {{the great majority of}} the seeds exhibit vernal germination which, in favourable conditions, is quasi-simultaneous in character. However, there is a variable proportion, usually small, of autumnal germinations resulting in a degree of seasonal dimorphism. The overwintering individuals, with their longer assimilatory activity, sometimes produce many times the average number of seeds. Germination, though favoured by light in adequate temperatures, was also found to occur in darkness. Though chiefly associated with non-calcareous soils, both species were found to germinate freely in calcareous as well as non-calcareous conditions.

25|$|As they {{approach}} {{the time when they}} are ready to migrate out to the sea the parr lose their camouflage bars and undergo a process of physiological changes which allows them to survive the shift from freshwater to saltwater. At this point salmon are called smolt. Smolt spend time in the brackish waters of the river estuary while their body chemistry adjusts their osmoregulation to cope with the higher salt levels they will encounter in the ocean. Smolt also grow the silvery scales which visually confuse ocean predators. When they have matured sufficiently in late spring, and are about 15 to 20 centimetres long, the smolt swim out of the rivers and into the sea. There they spend their first year as a post-smolt. Post-smolt form schools with other post-smolt, and set off to find deep-sea feeding grounds. They then spend up to four more years as adult ocean salmon while their full swimming ability and <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity</b> develop.|$|E
25|$|Drosophila species {{vary widely}} in their <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity.</b> Those such as D. melanogaster that breed in large, {{relatively}} rare resources have ovaries that mature 10–20 eggs at a time, {{so that they}} can be laid together on one site. Others that breed in more-abundant but less nutritious substrates, such as leaves, may only lay one egg per day. The eggs have one or more respiratory filaments near the anterior end; the tips of these extend above the surface and allow oxygen to reach the embryo. Larvae feed not on the vegetable matter itself, but on the yeasts and microorganisms present on the decaying breeding substrate. Development time varies widely between species (between 7 and more than 60 days) and depends on the environmental factors such as temperature, breeding substrate, and crowding. Numerous studies have shown that fruit flies lay eggs using an environmental circle. If fruit flies laid eggs at nighttime during which the environmental conditions were advantageous, the eggs could not be susceptible to desiccation from parasites. As a result, the offspring reproduced from these eggs would have greater fitness compared to offspring that were reproduced from eggs laid during the day. Since eggs are laid with a biological clock, D. melanogaster became adaptive to their environmental cycles, which showed a major advantage.|$|E

These fungi were mainly found in the mobile surface layer of the basin, becoming sparser with increasing depth. During dry periods, the Micromycetes in the mobile surface layers of the basin became mobilized by wind which accounted for the relatively uniform distributions of the surface microflora in the surrounding regions. It was discovered that the microfungal population of these superficial desert soils and sands had developed an adaptive morphology to protect them against unfavourable soil conditions. The dark pigmentation of these species is thought to protect them against light and desiccation, it can be seen in both the vegetative and reproductive states. As well, the spores of most of the Dematiaceae were reported as multicellular, septated transversely in the case of Helminthosporium which increases compartmentalization and protection. Another common characteristic of fungi isolated from desert sands is their rapid development and vast <b>reproductive</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E
