40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} the design, implementation, and characterization of a monolithic charge amplification channel {{for use as}} a piezoelectric sensor front-end in extreme environment applications. 12 The design leverages a 50 GHz peak-fT SiGe BiCMOS technology platform to achieve functionality across a wide-temperature range from- 180 ºC to 120 ºC. As part of a much larger <b>remote</b> <b>electronics</b> <b>unit,</b> the channel is specified to amplify piezoelectric transducer signals with frequencies up to 5 kHz and amplitudes as low as 200 pC. Intended for use in lunar surface systems, the application requires the capability to absorb up to 100 krad(SiO 2) of total ionizing dose (consistent with a typical lunar mission cycle) and be hardened against latch-up effects that cause system failure in a heavy ion radiation environment. Preliminary characterization of the channel shows the desired integratio...|$|E
40|$|A {{background}} {{investigation of}} the total-dose radiation tolerance of a third generation complementary SiGe:C BiCMOS technology platform was performed. Tolerance was quantified under proton and X-ray radiation sources for both the npn and pnp HBT, {{as well as for}} an operational amplifier built with these devices. Furthermore, a technique known as junction isolation radiation hardening was proposed and tested with the goal of improving the SEE sensitivity of the npn by reducing the charge collected by the subcollector {{in the event of a}} direct ion strike. Three independent systems were designed, including: 1) a charge amplification channel developed as part of a <b>remote</b> <b>electronics</b> <b>unit</b> for the lunar environment, 2) variable bias circuitry for a self-healing radar receiver, and 3) an ultra-fast x-ray detector for picosecond scale time-domain measurements of evolving chemical reactions. The first two projects capitalized on the wide-temperature performance and radiation tolerance of the SiGe HBT, allowing them to operate under extreme environmental conditions reliably and consistently. The third design makes use of the high-frequency capabilities of the HBT, particularly in emitter-coupled logic (ECL) configurations. Findings concerning the performance of these systems and implications for future research are discussed. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the architecture, verification, qualification, and packaging of a 16 -channel silicon-germanium (SiGe) <b>Remote</b> <b>Electronics</b> <b>Unit</b> (REU) {{designed for use}} in extreme environment applications encountered on NASA's exploration roadmap. The SiGe REU was targeted for operation outside the protective electronic "vaults" in a lunar environment that exhibits cyclic temperature swings from - 180 ºC to 120 ºC, a total ionizing dose (TID) radiation level of 100 krad, and heavy ion exposure (single event effects) over the mission lifetime. The REU leverages SiGe BiCMOS technological advantages and design methodologies, enabling exceptional extreme environment robustness. It utilizes a mixed-signal Remote Sensor Interface (RSI) ASIC and an HDL-based Remote Digital Control (RDC) architecture to read data from up to 16 sensors using three different analog channel types with customizable gain, current stimulus, calibration, and sample rate with 12 -bit analog-to-digital conversion. The SiGe REU exhibits excellent channel sensitivity throughout the temperature range, hardness to at least 100 krad TID exposure, and single event latchup immunity, representing the cutting edge in cold-capable electronic systems. The SiGe REU is the first example within a potential paradigm shift in space-based electronics. M. S.

40|$|Extreme environments pose major {{obstacles}} for electronics in {{the form}} of extremely wide temperature ranges and hazardous radiation. The most common mitigation procedures involve extensive shielding and temperature control or complete displacement from the environment with high costs in weight, power, volume, and performance. There has been a shift away from these solutions and towards distributed, in-environment electronic systems. However, for this methodology to be viable, the requirements of heavy radiation shielding and temperature control have to be lessened or eliminated. This work gained new understanding of the best practices in analog circuit design for extreme environments. Major accomplishments included the over-temperature - 180 C to + 120 C and radiation validation of the SiGe <b>Remote</b> <b>Electronics</b> <b>Unit,</b> a first of its kind, 16 channel, sensor interface for unshielded operation in the Lunar environment, the design of two wide-temperature (- 180 C to + 120 C), total-ionizing-dose hardened, wireline transceivers for the Lunar environment, the low-frequency-noise characterization of a second-generation BiCMOS process from 300 K down to 90 K, the explanation of the physical mechanisms behind the single-event transient response of cascode structures in a 45 nm, SOI, radio-frequency, CMOS technology, the analysis of the single-event transient response of differential structures in a 32 nm, SOI, RF, CMOS technology, and the prediction of scaling trends of single-event effects in SOI CMOS technologies.

Part I covers a more general solution for enabling remote access to equipment; the suggested solution can be applied to all types of instruments that can be controlled from a PC based system. Part III and IV of this thesis present an encouragement to collaborate within in the field of remote engineering to utilize the recourses more efficiently. The idea is that universities around the world can share their experiments in a grid laboratory; every university contributes with a small part, but gets access {{to a wide range of}} experiments in this grid.

As the user moves the lens module along the print line, tactile images of print letters are felt moving across the array of rods under the user's finger. The Optacon includes a knob to adjust the intensity at which the tactile array rods vibrate, a knob to set the image threshold between white and black needed to turn on the vibration of the rods in the tactile array, and a switch that determines whether images will be interpreted as dark print on a light background or as light print on a dark background.|$|R

50|$|Consider {{an example}} where a high voltage source powers up a typical <b>electronics</b> control <b>unit</b> {{which has an}} {{internal}} power supply with 11000 µF input capacitance. When powered from a 28 V source, the inrush current into the <b>electronics</b> <b>unit</b> would approach 31 amperes in 10 milliseconds. If that same circuit is activated by a 610 V source, then the inrush current would approach 670 A in 10 milliseconds. It is wise not to allow unlimited inrush currents from high voltage power distribution system activation into capacitive loads: instead the inrush current should be controlled to avoid power-up stress to components.|$|R
