40|$|Noise in {{hydraulic}} power steering systems is mainly generated by the hydraulic pump due to the cyclic pumping mechanism that creates pulsating flow transmitted by the fluid. This flow ripple and pressure ripple, propagating through the hydraulic circuit, interacts in a complex way with {{the other parts of}} the vehicle, generating audible noise inside the vehicle. The present work shows two ways to reduce the flow ripple amplitude generated by a vane pump through the redesigning of the pump rotating group. First, a nine-vane <b>rotor</b> <b>pump</b> is proposed and, secondly, a pump with three discharge ports is proposed. To check their results, a MatLab/Simulink based pump model was created according to the new geometrical characteristics and the results are compared with the regular pump ones. Also, a flow ripple experimental test was run using the Secondary Source Method to validate the numerical model results of the regular pump. The new designs simulation results show large flow ripple amplitude reduction (from 6 dB to 16 dB per harmonic) as well as frequency displacement in the discharge flow ripple spectra in both designs. Also, the simulations show perpendicular force on the pump shaft generated by the non-balanced conditions created by the new designs...|$|E

Conventional centrifugal pumps are no longer considered suitable for long-term application because of the possibility of occurrence of blood leakage and thrombus formation around the shaft seal.

In Europe, clinical trials of this pump have been successfully performed, and these pumps are commercially available. One of the aims of our study is to numerically examine the internal flow and the effect of leakage flow through the gap between the impeller and the pump casing on the performance of the pump. The results show that the pressure head increases compared with the pump without a gap for all flow rates because of the leakage of the fluid through the gap. It was observed that the leakage flow rate in the pump is sufficiently large; further, no stagnant fluid or dead flow regions were observed in the pump. Therefore, the present pump can efficiently enhance the washout effect...|$|E

40|$|The present work is an {{experimental}} and theoretical {{investigation of the}} possible forces of fluid dynamic origin that can act on a turbomachine rotor particularly when it is situated off its normal center position. An experimental facility, the Rotor Force Test Facility, has been designed and constructed {{in order to measure}} these kinds of forces acting on a centrifugal pump impeller when the latter is made to whirl in a slightly eccentric circular orbit. The rotor speed, eccentric orbital radii and whirl speed could be varied independently. The scope of the present experimental work consists of measuring quasi-steady forces on the impeller as it whirls slowly about the axis of the pump rotation. These forces are due to interaction between the impeller and volute; they are decomposed into force components relative to the geometric center of the volute and to those proportional to displacement from this center. These latter are interpreted as stiffness matrices. These matrices were measured on two widely differing volute types and both were found to have the property of being skew-symmetric. It can be shown that a stiffness matrix of this type can lead to dynamic instability of the impeller shaft system in certain circumstances. This new experimental finding may explain some operational problems of "high speed" hydraulic machinery. In the theoretical part of this thesis, a somewhat more physical model of a <b>rotor</b> <b>pump</b> is proposed other than has been used heretofore in most works namely an actuator disk having infinitely many blades.

For a generator, the rotor rotating-driven flow, usually {{referred to as the}} rotating pumping flow, {{plays an important role in}} rotor winding cooling. In this study, three-dimensional numerical analyzes are presented for turbulent pumping flow in the inter-coil rotor cavity and short cooling grooves of a generator. Calculations of the flow field and the mass flux distribution through the grooves were carried out in a sequence of four related cases Under an isothermal condition: (a) pumping flow, which is the self-generated flow resulted from the <b>rotor</b> <b>pumping</b> action; (b) mixing flow, which is the combination of the ventilating flow and pumping flow, under a constant density condition; (c) mixing flow, with density modeled by the ideal gas law; and (d) mixing flow, with different pressure differentials applied on the system. The comparisons of the results from these cases can provide useful information regarding the impacts of the ventilating flow, gas density, and system pressure differential on the mass flux distribution in the short cooling grooves. Results show that the pumping effect is strong enough to generate the cooling flow for rotor winding cooling. Therefore, for small- or mid-size generators ventilation fans may be eliminated. It also suggests that increasing the chimney dimension can improve the distribution uniformity of mass flux through the cooling grooves...|$|R

40|$|Twin-screw {{pumps are}} {{positive}} displacement machines. Two meshing screws connected by timing gears convey the fluid {{trapped in the}} screw chambers axially from suction to discharge and force it out against the back pressure. Because of the screw geometry, the circumferential pressure field around the screws is not balanced, resulting in net dynamic and static pressures applied on the rotors. The research work presented here aims at building and verifying a model to predict both: (1) the exciting lateral hydrodynamic forces produced by the unbalanced pressure field, and (2) the rotor response due to those forces. The model rests on the screw pump hydraulic models for predicting the pressure in the screw chambers {{as a function of}} the discharge pressure. These models are extended to predict the steady state dynamic pressure field {{as a function of the}} rotational angle of the rotor. The dynamic force resulting from the dynamic pressure field is calculated and applied to the rotor as a set of super-synchronous periodic forces. The structural model of the screw, although nonsymmetrical, was found to be accurately represented by an axisymmetric equivalent structure. The rotor response to the dynamic super-synchronous forces is calculated to predict the pump rotordynamic behavior. The work in this dissertation presents: (1) the axisymmetric structural model of the rotors (2) the proposed dynamic pressure model, (3) the screw <b>pump</b> <b>rotor</b> response, (4) the experimental validation of the dynamic pressure model and rotor response.
