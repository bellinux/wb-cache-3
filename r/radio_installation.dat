PLC's displaced boarders, and some of the classrooms, found a temporary home at Meriden School in Strathfield. The school purchased Lingwood, also in Strathfield, as a centre for the school's remaining activities.|$|E
5|$|The Mk. IV was {{a complex}} lash-up of systems, known collectively in the RAF as the Airborne <b>Radio</b> <b>Installation</b> 5003 (ARI 5003). Individual parts {{included}} the R3066 or R3102 receiver, T3065 transmitter, Modulator Type 20, Transmitter Aerial Type 19, Elevation Aerial Type 25, Azimuth Aerial Type 21 and 25, Impedance Matching Unit Type 35, Voltage Control Panel Type 3, and Indicator Unit Type 20 or 48.|$|E
25|$|The {{pilots were}} not {{informed}} by radio of each other's movements, so {{may have been}} unaware that the runway was being used for departures in both directions. Although the <b>radio</b> <b>installation</b> on the Aztec conformed to legislation then existing, its arrangement was criticised as the passenger/co-pilot could not hear in his headset transmissions made by the pilot. Four recommendations were made; three concerning the operation of Luton Airport and one concerning the <b>radio</b> <b>installation</b> in aircraft.|$|E

25|$|In November 1935, the {{operation}} of Noemijulia was again raised in Parliament. George Oliver asked whether the Board of Trade was aware that Noemijulias <b>radio</b> <b>installation</b> was defective, and what measures were being taken to correct this. Leslie Burgin replied that the Board was aware, and had requested that the ship be detained should she visit certain countries which had adopted the 1929 Safety Convention, but so far she had not docked at any port belonging {{to one of the}} signatories. In January 1936, Noemijulia arrived at Antwerp, Belgium, where she was detained. She was still detained in March as the defects in her radio and other defects had not been remedied.|$|E
500|$|In 1941, {{both the}} Principal Mary Hamilton, and the Senior Mistress (novelist, critic and historian) Flora Eldershaw, left {{the school to}} fill wartime {{positions}} in the bureaucracy. [...] In 1942, the new Principal, Dr Helen Wilkie, arrived to find falling enrolments, staffing problems and food shortages due {{to the effects of}} the Second World War. Word was soon received that Australian military authorities wished to inspect the school with a view to taking it over. On 24 March 1942, it was requested that PLC be occupied by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) for the purpose of establishing a top secret Radar Unit and military barracks known as No.1 RIMU (<b>Radio</b> <b>Installation</b> and Maintenance Unit). In order to accommodate PLC's students and classes, the Council approached Meriden School in Strathfield. Meriden agreed to house the boarders and the singing, domestic science, and physical education classes. PLC also purchased Lingwood, a property in Strathfield, as a centre for the school's remaining activities.|$|E

2500|$|Physically the Mk XIs had {{a deeper}} nose fairing to {{accommodate}} a larger 14.5 gal oil tank and used the unarmoured, wrap-around PRU windscreen. Booster pumps for the wing tanks were fitted and covered by teardrop shaped fairings under the wings. Retractable tailwheels were fitted as standard {{and the majority of}} the Mk XIs built had the later large-area pointed rudder. 260 Mk XIs were powered by Merlin 61, 63 or 63A engines, while the remaining 211 used the high-altitude Merlin 70. All of the Merlin 70 and 198 of the Merlin 60 series aircraft were fitted with the Vokes Aero-Vee dust filter in the extended, streamlined carburettor air intake under the nose. All Merlin 60 powered aircraft featured the fuel cooler in the port leading edge wing root. The <b>radio</b> <b>installation</b> was either the VHF TR.1133 or TR.1143 fitted with the [...] "Rebecca" [...] beam approach equipment.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1917, about 300 DH.6s were {{transferred}} to the RNAS for anti-submarine patrols. While far from ideal for this work, the type proved surprisingly [...] "seaworthy", being known to float {{for as long as}} ten hours after ditching. On operations, the underpowered trainer could not carry both an observer and weaponry. The majority of patrols were flown solo, allowing a token bomb load and a lightweight <b>radio</b> <b>installation</b> to be carried, although convoy escort missions generally carried an observer who could communicate with ships using an Aldis lamp. The [...] "built in" [...] instability designed to keep a student pilot alert proved tiring for pilots on long patrols over water, and experimental changes were made in mid-1918 to improve stability. These included the introduction of 10in (25cm) of back-stagger to wings of reduced chord and camber, with narrower elevators and rudder. DH.6s modified to this standard were unofficially dubbed [...] "DH 6As".|$|E

Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center was also established to monitor all air space over Central Norway. In 1955, a glass dome was built on top of the control tower, giving a much better view of the air field.|$|R

50|$|Ice {{can also}} be formed by {{seawater}} spray and water vapour freezing upon contact with a vessel's superstructure when temperature is low enough. Ice formed in this manner is known as rime. As the formation progress, the aboveboard weight of the vessel increases and may ultimately cause capsizing. Furthermore, rime ice may impede the correct functioning of important navigational instruments on board, such as radar or <b>radio</b> <b>installations.</b> Different strategies {{for the removal of}} such ice are employed: chipping away the ice or even using fire hoses in an attempt to remove the ice.|$|R
5000|$|In 1942, Bande Nere {{continued}} to support Italian convoys and interdict British ones. The Italian operation K7 ran supplies from Messina and Corfu to Tripoli with heavy naval support {{and there was}} an attempt to block the British convoy MW10, which led to the Second Battle of Sirte on 22 March 1942. Bande Nere was part of the battleship 's flotilla. The Italian cruiser scored a hit on a British counterpart [...] during this engagement, damaging her after turrets. Other reports state that Cleopatras radar and <b>radio</b> <b>installations</b> were disabled.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} morning of 24 November a group of armed {{individuals}} entered the hospital compound.

Hearing noise from upstairs, the head of the office went down to have a look. The robbers, being surprised, tackled him and shoved him into a corner and threatened him with a revolver to the temple. They left a small note whose translation said: “This here is for all the evil that you do.” ...|$|R

5000|$|The aircraft's {{major problem}} early in {{deployment}} was fuel leaks caused by failure of spot-welded fuel tanks from vibration. Also troublesome {{was the fact}} that the canopy could not be opened under certain conditions in earlier models, potentially trapping the pilot in a falling aircraft. As a result, some pilots had the sliding portion of the canopy removed altogether. The first 1,000 Yak-1s had no <b>radios.</b> <b>Installation</b> of <b>radio</b> equipment became common by spring 1942 and obligatory by August 1942. [...] But Soviet radios were notoriously unreliable and short-ranged, so they were frequently removed to save weight.|$|R
