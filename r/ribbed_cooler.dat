Four deflectors, including the sloping board (Case A), convex curved (Case B), concave curved (Case C), and cylindrical (Case D) deflectors, are {{mounted on the}} upper-downstream side of the ribs. The heat transfer and flow features are analyzed and compared based on the validation of the turbulence model and careful study of the grid independence.

Compared with the ribbed channel with sloping board deflectors, Case B can guide the mainstream fluid to compress the recirculating flow region located on the lee-side regions downstream from the rib and can enhance the heat transfer of the bottom surface, despite the increasing friction factor. It is noted that the decrement ratio of the friction factor in Case D is 7. 0 - 12. 4 %. Based on this remarkable expression, Cases B and D contribute to better overall performance.

Cooling channels within turbine airfoils directly affect component lifecycle in addition to influencing almost {{all aspects of the}} overall engine design. However, many aspects regarding flow structure and vortex dynamics within these cooling channels are still unknown. In this study, high fidelity Time Resolved Digital Particle Image Velocimetry (TRDPIV) was used to investigate a <b>ribbed</b> <b>cooling</b> channel. The design consisted of a square channel having square transverse ribs which were staggered on both the top and bottom walls. Rib spacing was matched to the channel height and the rib to channel height ratio was kept constant at 0. 13. The Reynolds number range investigated was between 2, 500 and 20, 000. Flow field measurements were performed at the entrance to and within the developed rib roughened section, corresponding to the 1 st and 12 th ribs. Overall, the results indicate that large scale coherent vortical structures were generated by the presence of the front rib surface and enclosed wake region between the ribs. Higher values of vortex circulation strength were observed for Re= 2, 500 in addition to a more homogeneous distribution of identified coherent structures at the developed section.

40|$|A {{first part}} of a ”Heat Transfer Handbook” about {{correlations}} for internal cooling of gas turbine vanes and blades has been created. The work {{is based on the}} cooling of vanes and blades 1 and 2 on different Siemens Gas Turbines. The cooling methods increase the heat transfer in the cooling channels by increasing the heat transfer coefficient and/or increasing the heat transfer surface area. The penalty paid for the increased heat transfer is higher pressure losses. Three <b>cooling</b> methods, called <b>rib</b> turbulated <b>cooling,</b> matrix cooling and impingement <b>cooling</b> were investigated. <b>Rib</b> turbulated <b>cooling</b> and impingement cooling are typically used in the leading edge or mid region of the airfoil and matrix cooling is mostly applied in the trailing edge region. Literature studies for each cooling method, covering both open literature and internal reports, were carried out in order to find correlations developed from tests. The correlations were compared and analyzed with focus on suitability for use in turbine conditions. The analysis resulted in recommendations about what correlations to use for each <b>cooling</b> method. For <b>rib</b> turbulated <b>cooling</b> in square or rectangular ducts, four correlations developed by Han and his co-workers [3. 5], [3. 8], [3. 9] and [3. 6] are recommended, each valid for different channel and rib geometries. For U-shaped channels, correlations of Nagoga [3. 4] are recommended. Matrix cooling is relatively unknown in west, but has been used for many years in the former Soviet Union. Therefore available information in open literature is limited. Only one source of correlations was found. The correlations were developed by Nagoga [4. 2] and are valid for closed matrixes. Siemens Gas Turbines are cooled with open matrixes, why further work with developing correlations is needed. For impingement cooling on a flat target plate, a correlation of Florschuetz et al. [5. 7] is recommended for inline impingement arrays. For staggered arrays, both the correlations of Florschuetz et al. [5. 7] and Höglund [5. 8] are suitable. The correlations for impingement on curved target plate gave very different results. The correlation of Nagoga is recommended, but it is also advised to consult the other correlations when calculating heat transfer for a specific case. Another part of the work has been to investigate the codes of two heat transfer programs named Q 3 D and Multipass, used in the Siemens offices in Finspång and Lincoln, respectively.

The k-ε turbulence model and Eddy Dissipation Concept (EDC) were used for modeling turbulent flow and combustion, respectively. In the modeling of heat transfer through the walls, a conjugate heat transfer formulation was applied. The temperatures calculated by the models were compared with experimental data.

40|$|A {{rotating}} {{cooling system}} with a 180 deg turn is investigated experimentally using the 2 C PIV technique to measure the flow inside. This cooling configuration consists of two ducts of arbitrary cross-sections representing a two-pass front part of an idealized but nevertheless engine relevant turbine blade cooling design. The system has been investigated with ribbed walls in both passages for cooling enhancement {{as well as with}} smooth walls as a reference version in order to identify the effects induced by ribs. The rib orientation on the walls is 45 deg. With a rib height of 0. 1 of hydraulic duct diameter and a pitch of 10 times rib height, a representative well-established rib lay-out was selected. This paper presents measurements of the axial flow during rotation of this two-pass system for rotation numbers up to 0. 1. Together with previously obtained stationary results, this data completes the investigation of the secondary flow field with rotational results acquired with a two-component PIV measuring technique with improved sequencer technique. The Two-Pass Cooling System was analyzed on the rotating test rig using two-component Particle Image Velocimetry (2 C PIV) a non-intrusive optical planar measurement technique. PIV is capable of obtaining complete flow maps of the instantaneous as well as averaged flow field even at high turbulence levels, which are typical for the narrow serpentine-shaped <b>ribbed</b> <b>cooling</b> systems. An in-house developed synchronization device enables very accurate control of the laser flashes and image acquisition with regard to the angular position of the measurement plane (light sheet) and thereby very accurately stabilizes the position of the channel within the image during PIV recording which then leads to very accurate mean velocities. The presented investigations were conducted in stationary and rotating mode. The results demonstrate the combined interaction of different vortices induced by several effects such as the inclination of ribs, Coriolis forces due to rotation and inertial forces within the bend. Additionally, a flow separation was observed at the divider wall downstream of the bend (in the second pass) that has a strong impact on the flow field depending on the rotational speed. The axial flow maps presented in this paper in combination with the secondary flow maps published previously are of sufficient high quality and spatial resolution to serve as a benchmark test case for the validation of flow solvers. The turbulent channel flow was investigated at a Reynolds number of 50, 000 and at rotation numbers of 0. 0 and 0. 1. ...|$|R

Modern high-speed aero-engines operate at elevated temperatures about 2000 K to achieve better cycle efficiencies. However, the presently available alloys cannot resist temperatures much higher than 1350 K. Internal cooling techniques for gas turbine blades have been studied for several decades. The internal cooling techniques of the gas turbine blade includes: jet impingement, <b>rib</b> turbulated <b>cooling,</b> and pin-fin cooling which have been developed to maintain the metal temperature of turbine vane and blades within acceptable limits in this harsh environment. The designers need detailed hot gas path heat transfer and temperature distributions along with the detailed flow and heat transfer data to understand the flow physics and to improve the current internal cooling designs. Gas turbine blades are cooled internally by passing the coolant through several artificially roughened serpentine passages to remove heat conducted from the outside surface. The cooling passages located in the middle of the airfoils are often lined with rib turbulators. Near the leading edge of the blade, jet impingement (coupled with film cooling) is commonly used. Pin-fins and dimples can be used in the trailing edge portion of the blades. These techniques have also been combined to further increase the heat transfer from the airfoil walls. For internal cooling, focus is now placed on the effect of rotation o...|$|R

Nowadays gas turbines have been put to use in various fields like, power plants, marine industries {{as well as for}} industrial propulsion. For high thermal efficiency advanced gas turbines use high temperature at the entry of the turbine. Therefore, for the purpose of increasing thermal efficiency of the turbines, it is imperative to design effective cooling schemes. The current Turbine Inlet Temperature in advanced gas turbines is much higher than the melting point of the blade material.

Static instrumentation was installed {{at the end of a}} long smooth passage and used to measure local flow features in a series of experiments where ribs were incrementally added upstream. This improves test turnaround time and allows higher-resolution heat transfer coefficient distributions to be captured, using a hybrid transient liquid crystal technique. A composite heat transfer coefficient distribution for a 12 -rib-pitch passage is reported: notably the behaviour is dominated by the development of the secondary flow in the passage throughout. Both the aerodynamic and heat transfer test data were compared to numerical simulations developed using a commercial computational fluid dynamics solver. By conducting a number of simulations it was possible to interrogate the validity of the underlying assumptions of the experimental strategy; their validity is discussed. The results capture the developing size and strength of the vortical structures in secondary flow. The local flow field was shown to be strongly coupled to the enhancement of heat transfer coefficient. Comparison of the experimental and numerical data generally shows excellent agreement in the level of heat transfer coefficient predicted, though the numerical simulations fail to capture some local enhancement on both the ribbed and smooth surfaces.

Due to such high temperatures there is a possibility that the turbine blades may get damaged due to produced thermal stresses and presents a possible threat to the turbine system as well as the operators.

Therefore, along with development in high temperature material, a more sophisticated cooling scheme must be developed for continuing the safe operation of gas turbines with high performances. Gas turbine blades can be cooled internally as well as externally. This paper {{is focused on the}} internal cooling of turbine blades and vanes of a gas turbine. Internal cooling can be achieved by passing coolant through various enhanced serpentine passages inside the blade and extracting heat from outside of the blades. Jet impingement, matrix <b>cooling,</b> <b>rib</b> turbulator, dimple and pin fin cooling are utilized as the methods of internal cooling, which are presented in various articles. Due to the different enhancement in heat transfer and in pressure drop, they are being used in specific part of the blades and the vanes on a gas turbine. The matrix cooling, also known as lattice-work or vortex cooling provides a good strength to blades by the layers of ribs which intersect each other from the opposite wall. A significant increase in the heat transfer is obtained due to an increase in heat transfer area, impinging and in swirling flows (which helps to promote turbulence), induced by the geometry of the matrix cooling channels...|$|R
40|$|Parasito intracelular obrigatório de animais homeotérmicos, o Toxoplasma gondii esta distribuído amplamente pelo mundo, e somente nos Felídeos realiza a reprodução sexuada. Nos ovinos causa prejuízos econômicos, principalmente devido ao aborto. As formas de contaminação são por oocistos em água ou alimentos, cistos teciduais em vísceras e tecidos, por taquizoítos em fluidos e congenitamente. A transmissão do parasito pelo consumo de carne crua é umas das mais importantes, sendo assim, utilizou-se um cordeiro, infectado naturalmente, com titulação de anticorpos de 1 : 256, avaliada pelo teste de RIFI. Este animal foi abatido {{conforme}} a legislação e após abate foram coletadas amostras de cérebro, diafragma, fígado e coração para exame histopatológico e para PCR, e coletado aproximadamente 50 g dos cortes da paleta, costela e pernil e 16 g do coração sendo esta a coleta in natura (T 0), para realização do bioensaio em camundongos e PCR. Após a primeira coleta, a carcaça foi encaminhada a refrigeração, permanecendo inteira na câmara de resfriamento a 7 °C por 24 h, juntamente com o coração. Após este período, nova coleta foi realizada (T 1), assim como descrito e foram divididos os cortes e estes passaram para o congelamento a - 10 °C, e as coletas foram realizadas com 12 h (T 2), 60 h (T 3) e 120 h (T 4) nesta temperatura. Em cada tempo de tratamento, as amostras coletadas passaram pela digestão péptica e inoculadas em dois camundongos por amostra, o restante da digestão, era utilizada para PCR. Os camundongos foram eutanasiados com oito semanas e seus órgãos como pulmão, coração, fígado, baço, rins e amostra de tecido muscular esquelético da coxa foram coletados para histopatológico, já o cérebro era coletado para PCR e para técnica de squash. Sangue dos camundongos foram coletados para realização do teste de RIFI. Na PCR das amostras oriundas do ovino, o cérebro e amostra do corte da costela in natura (T 0) foram positivas, já na PCR do cérebro dos camundongos, somente o animal inoculado com amostra do corte da paleta in natura (T 0) foi positivo. Após a realização da PCR, as amostras positivas foram sequenciadas, que demonstrou mais de 97 % de identidade com o T. gondii. Na técnica do squash, o camundongo inoculado com o corte da costela após o resfriamento a 7 °C por 24 h (T 1) apresentou cisto cerebral. Na RIFI do soro dos camundongos, um animal inoculado com o corte da costela in natura (T 0) e um com a costela após o resfriamento a 7 °C por 24 h (T 1) apresentaram titulação 1 : 64, os demais negativos. No exame histopatológico dos órgãos do ovino e dos camundongos, somente o camundongo inoculado com o corte da costela após o resfriamento a 7 °C por 24 h (T 1) apresentou cisto, sendo estes presentes no coração, pulmão e tecido muscular da coxa. O consumo de carne ovina, in natura e após o resfriamento é passível de transmissão para quem a consumir. Portanto, somente o resfriamento de cortes comerciais desta espécie não inviabiliza o parasitoAn obligatory {{intracellular parasite}} of warm-blooded animals, Toxoplasma gondii is widely distributed around the world, {{and only in}} the feline species it performs sexual reproduction. In sheep it brings economic losses, mainly due to abortion. Contamination ways are from oocysts in water or food, tissue and visceral cysts, by tachyzoites in fluids and congenitally. The most important parasite transmission occurs through raw meat consumption, so we used a lamb, naturally infected with antibody titer of 1 : 256 as measured by IFA test. This animal was slaughtered {{according to the law}} and after slaughter brain, diaphragm, liver and heart samples were collected for histopathology and PCR, and it was collected approximately 50 g of shoulder, rib and leg cuts and 16 g of heart was an "in natura " collection (T 0), for bioassay in mice and PCR. After the first collection, the carcass was kept cooling down, remaining whole in the cooling chamber at 7 °C for 24 hours, along with the heart. After this period, a second test was performed (T 1), as previously described and the cuts were divided and they went to freezing at - 10 °C, samples were taken with 12 hours (T 2), 60 h (T 3) and 120 h (T 4) at this temperature. In each treatment period, the collected samples went through peptic digestion and were inoculated in two mice per sample, the rest of the digestion was used for PCR. The mice were sacrificed at eight weeks and their organs like lungs, heart, liver, spleen, kidney and skeletal muscle tissue sample from the thigh were collected for histopathology, since the brain was collected for PCR and "squash" technique. Blood of mice was collected to perform the IFA test. PCR of samples derived from the sheep, the brain and rib cut sample "in natura" (T 0) were positive, as in the PCR of the mice brain, only the inoculated animal with shoulder cutting sample "in natura" (T 0) was positive. After completion of the PCR, positive samples were sequenced, which showed over 97 % identity with T. gondii. In "squash" technique the mice inoculated with the <b>ribs</b> cutting after <b>cooling</b> at 7 °C for 24 hours (T 1) presented brain cyst. IFA in mice serum, an animal inoculated with the rib cut "in natura" (T 0) and one with <b>rib</b> after <b>cooling</b> at 7 °C for 24 hours (T 1) presented titration 1 : 64, the others were negative. In histopathological examination of sheep and mice organs, only the inoculated mice with the <b>rib</b> cut after <b>cooling</b> at 7 °C for 24 hours (T 1) presented cysts, which were present in the heart, lung and muscle tissue of the thigh. The lamb consumption "in natura" and after cooling is capable of transmission to those who consume. Therefore, only the cooling down of commercial cuts of this kind does not undermine the parasit...|$|R
40|$|A {{numerical}} code is developed {{to calculate the}} temperature distributions {{on the surface of}} a gas turbine blade. This code is a tool for quick prediction of the temperatures by knowing the boundary conditions and the flow conditions, and doesn?t necessarily provide the most accurate results that could be obtained by performing an experiment or precise CFD simulations. Different systems of blade external and internal <b>cooling,</b> such as <b>rib</b> turbulated <b>cooling,</b> impingement cooling, pin-fins, and injection holes for film cooling, are considered in the code by using the appropriate correlations or factors. When the code is run and the results are obtained a gas turbine blade designer can modify his blade terms and conditions such as mass flow rate, number of injection holes in each passage, even the blade material thickness to find an optimum design for cooling purposes. Code is first applied to an E? blade; the external heat transfer coefficients for this blade is inserted as a known boundary condition; Next, code is run for the same blade but this time using the flat plate and convectional correlations for predicting transition on suction side of the blade for external heat transfer coefficient. This code provides an easy way to get {{a better understanding of the}} cooling design and its ability to be modified for any gas turbine blade makes it more flexible to be developed as a commercial tool in future. In the next step, code is applied to a Samsung-Rotor 2 blade with different cooling design than an E? blade and results are presented. Another part is introduced to this project by running a CFD simulation using commercial software Fluent and Gambit, to capture heat transfer coefficient distributions around the surface of the blade and the obtained values is used back in the code. In the meanwhile some interesting observations made during the CFD simulation is discussed. The CFD simulation is performed for the cases where there are not any data available for external heat transfer coefficient distribution already. Two turbulence models, k-epsilon and SST-Transition were utilized for the 2 D CFD study; and for the 3 D CFD case, only k-epsilon model was applied. It was revealed that even though SST- Transition has a better prediction of Mach number, but in terms of heat transfer coefficient k-epsilon model provides closer values to the reference values from previous works. Finally, combining the code and the CFD results could act as a useful assistant to give a designer a general and quick idea of how his blade design will perform at the end...|$|R
40|$|Heat {{transfer}} coefficients in {{the cooling}} cavities of turbine airfoils are greatly {{enhanced by the}} presence of discrete ribs on the cavity walls. These ribs introduce two heat transfer enhancing features: a significant increase in heat transfer coefficient by promoting turbulence and mixing, and an increase in heat transfer area. Considerable amount of data are reported in open literature for the heat transfer coefficients both on the rib surface and on the floor area between the <b>ribs.</b> Many airfoil <b>cooling</b> design software tools, however, require an overall average heat transfer coefficient on a rib-roughened wall. Dealing with a complex flow circuit in conjunction with 180 ∘ bends, numerous film holes, trailing-edge slots, tip bleeds, crossover impingement, and a conjugate heat transfer problem; these tools are not often able to handle the geometric details of the rib-roughened surfaces or local variations in heat transfer coefficient on a rib-roughened wall. On the other hand, assigning an overall area-weighted average heat transfer coefficient based on the rib and floor area and their corresponding heat transfer coefficients will have the inherent error of assuming a 100 % fin efficiency for the ribs, that is, assuming that rib surface temperature {{is the same as the}} rib base temperature. Depending on the rib geometry, this error could produce an overestimation of up to 10 % in the evaluated rib-roughened wall heat transfer coefficient. In this paper, a correction factor is developed that can be applied to the overall area-weighted average heat transfer coefficient that, when applied to the projected rib-roughened cooling cavity walls, the net heat removal from the airfoil is the same as that of the rib-roughened wall. To develop this correction factor, the experimental results of heat transfer coefficients on the rib and on the surface area between the ribs are combined with about 400 numerical conduction models to determine an overall equivalent heat transfer coefficient that can be used in airfoil cooling design software. A well-known group method of data handling (GMDH) scheme was then utilized to develop a correlation that encompasses most pertinent parameters including the rib geometry, rib fin efficiency, and the rib and floor heat transfer coefficients...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of the {{investigation}} is related to the heat transfer and fluid flow problem inside ribbed ducts with a square cross section. The typical applications of this problem are in the cooling of gas turbine blades and guiding vanes. The second part is related to application of intercoolers in gas turbine systems. The intercooling is performed via intercoolers that usually are water-air heat exchangers. The ducts considered have rib turbulators in order to enhance the heat transfer rate. Firstly, a literature investigation is carried out and examples of different prediction methods for ribbed ducts are presented. Application of these <b>ribbed</b> ducts in <b>cooling</b> for gas turbine blades are discussed. The importance and role of intercoolers in gas turbine systems are discussed and their importance in future gas turbine systems is mentioned. Importance of various heat exchangers and extended surface types is presented and examples of heat exchangers concepts for intercooler applications are considered. A numerical calculation procedure is presented. The governing equations are the continuity, the Navier-Stokes and the energy equations in their general form for incompressible flows. In turbulent cases the time averaged form of this set of equations has been used. The turbulence modeling consists of two low-Re number turbulence models and two methods for determination of the turbulent Reynolds stresses, namely, Eddy Viscosity Model (EVM) and Explicit Algebraic Stress Model (EASM). The model development is carried out to ensure that the original EASM is consistent with the low-Re number k-epsilon turbulence model applied. A certain method is developed to deal with the de-coupling of the velocity and Reynolds stress fields in the collocated grid arrangement that is chosen in this work. The pressure-velocity coupling is handled by the SIMPLEC algorithm in turbulent cases and the PISO algorithm in unsteady laminar flow cases. Seven papers are included. In the first paper turbulent flow and heat transfer in a rotating smooth duct and a ribbed duct is considered. An EVM method with a low-Re number model is applied. The second paper consists of application of EASM and EVM with a low-Re number model to a ribbed duct case and presentation of detailed local variables and flow phenomena. The third paper presents a discussion of the role of intercoolers in gas turbine systems and means to improve performance are mentioned. The fourth paper presents a set of numerical analyses and CFD calculations carried out on various concepts of intercoolers. The fifth paper presents a discussion and comparison of some heat exchanger types readily applicable for a gas turbine intercooler. A comparison of the intercooler core volume, weight and pressure drop is presented. In the sixth paper two low-Re number turbulence models and EVM and EASM models are used to investigate a ribbed duct case. The local results as well as the averaged total values are compared with available experimental results. In the final paper, unsteady calculations for an offset strip fin have been carried out. The mechanisms of heat transfer enhancement are discussed and the creation of the temperature and velocity fluctuations has been investigated and the dissimilarity between them has been proved...|$|R
