50|$|One of {{the initial}} {{adjustment}} overlooked by many new users is the lenses vertical parallax, that must {{not be confused with}} the horizontal parallax (set manually by the left <b>rocker</b> <b>button).</b> Although the lenses should be perfectly aligned, by design, there is a small vertical axis error inherent for each camera body. This error implies that all pictures (and videos as well) taken with a wrong vertical parallax are harder to look at, because one eye is looking up while the other is looking down. To effectively correct this optical discrepancy, the camera offers a vertical parallax correction in its menu system: MENU/SET/OPT AXIS CONTROL. The best way to use this adjustment is to zoom at maximum, take a picture, then analyse it with a software stereoscopic player(using row or column interlaced view) to obtain the subject at the same vertical level.|$|E
