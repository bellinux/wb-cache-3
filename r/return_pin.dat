ODB pinned her and then chased her backstage, coming out later with the burqa. Kong hit ODB {{in the back of the}} head while Saeed ran to reclaim her attire, her face masked by her hair at the time. Later that month Roxxi used a burqa to {{disguise}} herself as Saeed while Kong was facing newcomer Mercedes Steele. After the match Roxxi removed her disguise and attacked Kong with a steel chair, while Saeed appeared at the top of the entrance ramp bound in ropes (implying that she had been abducted by Roxxi prior to the match). Kong took revenge, pinning Roxxi in a tag effort also involving Saeed and Wilde, respectively, but Roxxi would make a <b>return</b> <b>pin</b> on Saeed in a singles match weeks later.|$|E

40|$|Annealing short {{very low}} {{magnetostriction}} amorphous ribbons in the demagnetized state {{results in a}} Perminvar-like reentrant hysteresis loop due to domain wall stabilization by the induced anisotropy. After a hard saturation, the loop changes to that of an unprocessed ribbon. In this investigation, ribbons are annealed in the demagnetized state with one wall along the ribbon middle. This wall becomes pinned during the heat treatment. Reentrant reversal occurs when reverse domains are nucleated at the ribbon edge with a threshold field larger than the demagnetizing field, this wall does not annihilate when it meets the pinned wall but leaves a line of reverse domains stabilized by ripple in the anisotropy. These domains enable a regular smooth reversal for the demagnetization process until the ribbon <b>returns</b> to the <b>pinned</b> configuration. The regular loop appears when the ribbon has been completely saturated by a large field. Mobile walls are nucleated {{on both sides of}} the pinned wall so that the ribbon does not <b>return</b> to the <b>pinned</b> configuration. Reversal now follows the usual demagnetization curve over the entire cycle. Kerr magnetooptical domain and domain wall observations are used in this investigation.

50|$|The MIDI {{specification}} for {{the electrical}} interface {{is based on}} a fully isolated current loop. The MIDI out port nominally sources a +5 volt source through a 220 ohm resistor out through pin 4 on the MIDI out DIN connector, in on pin 4 of the receiving device's MIDI in DIN connector, through a 220 ohm protection resistor and the LED of an opto-isolator. The current then <b>returns</b> via <b>pin</b> 5 on the MIDI in port to the originating device's MIDI out port pin 5, again with a 220 ohm resistor in the path, giving a nominal current of about 5 milliamperes. Despite the cable's appearance, there is no conductive path between the two MIDI devices, only an optically isolated one. Properly designed MIDI devices are relatively immune to ground loops and similar interference. The data rate on this system is 31,250 bits per second, logic 0 being current on.|$|R

50|$|As {{described}} in a film magazine, a modern man and woman quarrel and, in reaction to his wife, the husband recalls {{all the women in}} history who have failed their husbands or lovers. Being in an unpleasant state, he recalls Adam in the garden with a very vain Eve who disports herself in a Broadway fashion and causes the downfall of caveman-like Adam. Then he dwells on the hideous betrayal of Claudius by an unfaithful Messilna. Next he recalls the useless ruination of Abelard by the charming Heloise. Following this episode he remembers Cyrene and the fisherman, where the wife basely deserted her husband and children to swim once more in her seal skin that had been hidden from her for many years. A particularly disagreeable episode in which a young woman during the American Civil War sacrifices a wounded soldier for a bauble. After this the modern woman <b>returns</b> and <b>pins</b> up a Red Cross poster, and the modern man sees the many women of today as more or less uninspiring.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the seasonality in {{the probability of}} information-based trading (PIN) -return relationship, the 'January PIN effect'.

According to the analysis, the December selling pressure associated with the January effect decreases in PIN, especially for small stocks. This suggests that when the price bounces back in January, low-PIN stocks will exhibit a larger return within a small stock group, leading to the negative PIN-return pattern. Furthermore, this seasonality {{is not the same as}} other January anomalies associated with momentum and idiosyncratic risk.
