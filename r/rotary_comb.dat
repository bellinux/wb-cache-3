Thanks to an actuating <b>rotary</b> <b>comb</b> drive working in cooperation with another sensing <b>rotary</b> <b>comb</b> drive, the system is able to recognize the tissue sample stiness.

40|$|In this work, {{we report}} a new design for an electrostatically {{actuated}} microgripper with a post-assembly self-locking mechanism. The microgripper arms {{are driven by}} <b>rotary</b> <b>comb</b> actuators, enabling the microgripper to grip objects of any size from 0 to 100 μm. The post-assembly mechanism is driven by elastic deformation energy and static electricity to produce self-locking and releasing actions. The mechanism enables the microgripper arms to grip for long periods without continuously applying the external driving signal, which significantly reduces the effects and damage to the gripped objects caused by these external driving signals. The microgripper was fabricated using a Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) wafer with a 30 μm structural layer. Test results show that this gripper achieves a displacement of 100 μm with a driving voltage of 33 V, and a metal wire with a diameter of about 1. 6 mil is successfully gripped to demonstrate the feasibility of this post-assembly self-locking mechanism...|$|E

Micromechanical properties such as beam deformation, pivot position and pivot shift are investigated and compared with the virtual pivot formed by a cantilever beam. It is shown that the real pivot has negligible shift when subjected to load and fabrication error owing to its feature of structural symmetry, while the virtual pivot suffers from significant pivot shift, which would severely limit the wavelength tuning range. The two pivot designs are implemented into MEMS tuning structures that are fabricated by deep etching and released using a dry release approach. The real pivot measures a depth variation of 16 % over the double-clamped beam but maintains the symmetry to the midpoint, and is still able to produce a rotation angle of 4. 7. In contrast, the virtual pivot has a depth reduction of 4 % over the cantilever beam, but achieves only a 2. 4 rotation due to the pull-in problem originated from the severe pivot shift. The real pivot design is more suitable for the MEMS tunable lasers as it is simple, symmetric, robust, and suitable for single-chip integration.

40|$|The manual {{harvest of}} olives {{is one of}} the most {{expensive}} operations in the table olives production, but the use of the electric hand-guided machines triples the productivity. The development of these new machines leads to changes in the harvesting methodologies and in the operator’s working behavior. These items may also affect the hand-arm vibration (HAV) transmitted to the operators during the work. Aim of this study is to evaluate the hand-arm vibration transmitted to the operator using an experimental electric labor saving machine with <b>rotary</b> <b>combs</b> with teeth of different dimensions covered by silicon to minimize the damage to the drupes. Moreover, the olives removal forces have been analyzed to understand if the force necessary to detach the drupes is correlated to the vibration levels transmitted to the operator’s hand arm. With this type of hand held olive harvester, it has been found that higher is the fruit removal force, higher are the measured vibration levels...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{design of}} a {{microelectromechanical}} systems (MEMS) control moment gyroscope (MCMG) was proposed in this paper in order to generate a torque output with a magnitude of 10 - 6 N∙m. The MCMG consists of two orthogonal angular vibration systems, i. e., the rotor and gimbal; the coupling between {{which is based on}} the Coriolis effect and will cause a torque output in the direction perpendicular to the two vibrations. The angular rotor vibration was excited by the in-plane electrostatic <b>rotary</b> <b>comb</b> actuators, while the angular gimbal vibration was driven by an out-of-plane electrostatic parallel plate actuator. A possible process flow to fabricate the structure was proposed and discussed step by step. Furthermore, an array configuration using four MCMGs as an effective element, in which the torque was generated with a phase difference of 90 degrees between every two MCMGs, was proposed to smooth the inherent fluctuation of the torque output for a vibrational MCMG. The parasitic torque was cancelled by two opposite MCMGs with a phase difference of 180 degrees. The designed MCMG was about 1. 1 cm × 1. 1 cm × 0. 04 cm in size and 0. 1 g in weight. The simulation results showed that the maximum torque output of a MCMG, the resonant frequency of which was approximately 1, 000 Hz, was about 2. 5 × 10 - 8 N∙m. The element with four MCMGs could generate a torque of 5 × 10 - 8 N∙m. The torque output could reach a magnitude of 10 - 6 N∙m when the frequency was improved from 1, 000 Hz to 10, 000 Hz. Using arrays of 4 × 4 effective elements on a 1 kg spacecraft with a standard form factor of 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm, a 10 degrees attitude change could be achieved in 26. 96 s...|$|E
