25|$|<b>Running</b> <b>rigging</b> is {{the rigging}} of a sailing vessel {{that is used}} for raising, lowering, shaping and {{controlling}} the sails on a sailing vessel—as opposed to the standing rigging, which supports the mast and bowsprit. <b>Running</b> <b>rigging</b> varies between vessels that are rigged fore and aft {{and those that are}} square-rigged.|$|E
25|$|The brig's {{foremast}} {{is smaller}} than the main mast. The fore mast holds a fore sail, fore top sail, fore top gallant sail, and fore royal. Between the fore mast and the bowsprit are the fore staysail, jib, and flying jib. All the yards are manipulated by a complicated arrangement of cordage named the <b>running</b> <b>rigging.</b> This is opposed to the standing rigging which is fixed, and keeps mast and other objects rigid.|$|E
25|$|Work on {{the ship}} was {{suspended}} when Scott and Linton {{ran out of money}} to pay for further work. Rather than simply liquidate the company, an arrangement was made for Denny's to take over the contract and complete the ship, which was finally launched on 22 November 1869 by Captain Moodie's wife. The ship was moved to Denny's yard to have her masts fitted, and then on 20 December towed downriver to Greenock to have her <b>running</b> <b>rigging</b> installed. In the event, completing the ship meant the company's creditors were owed even more money than when work had first been halted.|$|E
50|$|The square rig is aerodynamically {{the most}} {{efficient}} <b>running</b> <b>rig</b> (i.e., sailing downwind), and stayed popular on ocean-going sailing ships {{until the end of}} the Age of Sail. The last commercial sailing ships, windjammers, were usually square-rigged four-masted barques.|$|R

25|$|Lipton {{persisted in}} a third {{challenge}} in 1903. With the aim to fend off Lipton's challenges indefinitely, the NYYC garnered a huge budget for a single cup contender, whose design would be commissioned to Herreshoff again. Improving on the Independence and his previous designs, the new defender Reliance remains the largest race sloop ever built. She featured a ballasted rudder, dual-speed winches below decks, and a cork-decked aluminium topside that hid <b>running</b> <b>rigging.</b> The design focus on balance was exemplary, but the extreme yacht also required the skills of an excellent skipper, which defaulted choice options to Charlie Barr. Facing the equally bold challenger Shamrock III, Barr led the Reliance to victory in just three races.|$|E
25|$|Departing 12 May, Georgiana cruised off the Galapagos {{in search}} of British whaling ships. While sailing near James Island 28 May, she met Catherine and Rose and {{captured}} them with no resistance. She then chased a third whaler, Hector and engaged in a brief, but sharp, combat which brought down Hectors main-topmast and most of her standing and <b>running</b> <b>rigging.</b> After capturing Hector, Georgiana placed the crews of all three whalers in Rose, under parole, and sent her as a cartel to St Helena. Georgiana, Catherine, and Hector then on 24 June joined Essex at Tumbez, Peru. Also on 28 May, Essex captured the whaler Greenwich; Porter armed her too as and put Lieutenant Gamble of the US Marines on her as captain.|$|E
2500|$|Standing rigging is 1 x 19 {{stainless}} steel wire rope (breaking strength [...] ) with swage terminals, {{stainless steel}} turnbuckles and chain plates. <b>Running</b> <b>rigging</b> is of Samson braid, including jib sheets and main sheet.

2500|$|Recreational {{fishermen}} take {{large quantities}} of the species during winter predominantly, although they are present year round in most areas. Large catches are possible, with rigs kept as light as possible to avoid spooking the fish. Simple <b>running</b> sinker <b>rigs</b> using a size 6 - 2 hook, on 2 – 3kg lines are commonly used, occasionally with red tubing employed as an attractant. Bait consists of the species natural prey such as prawns or bass yabbies, bivalves, a variety of marine worms, as well as bait such as squid. There are currently bag limits in Queensland of 50 winter whiting per person ...|$|R
2500|$|In centuries past, a ship's rigging was {{typically}} fashioned from rope. In the 19th century this was {{commonly referred to}} as Manilla, a reference to the origin of much good quality rope. Traditionally the <b>running</b> <b>rigging</b> was easily recognized since, for flexibility, it was not coated with tar and therefore of a lighter color than the standing rigging which was tarred for protection from weather and therefore darker or even black in color. On modern vessels, <b>running</b> <b>rigging</b> is likely to be made from synthetic fibers, while the standing rigging is most often fashioned from stainless steel [...] "wire rope". Since the 1990s, several new synthetic fibers have become common, particularly on racing and other high-performance sailing boats. These fibers include Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene [...] (UHMWPE) (also known as Spectra or Dynema), Vectran, and Technora.|$|E
2500|$|Standing rigging {{comprises}} the fixed lines, wires, or rods, which support each mast or bowsprit [...] on a sailing vessel and reinforce those spars against wind loads {{transferred from the}} sails. [...] This term is used in contrast to <b>running</b> <b>rigging,</b> which represents the moveable elements of rigging which adjust the position {{and shape of the}} sails.|$|E

In an emergency he is also responsible for taking the correct counter measures to stop an uncontrolled well control situation from emerging. The driller will watch for gas levels coming out of the hole, how much drilling mud is going in, and other information. While tripping, the driller will run the floor and work the rig.|$|R

2500|$|On Monday, 26 January 1801, at 8.00 a.m., at , Oiseux, under Captain Samuel Hood Linzee fell in {{with and}} chased Dédaigneuse, which was bound from Cayenne to Rochefort with despatches.

Dédaigneuse maintained her lead until 2.00 a.m. on the 28th when came within small arms range. Dédaigneuse opened fire from her stern-chasers, and the two British ships returned fire. After a running fight of 45 minutes, two miles off shore near Cape Bellem, fire primarily from Sirius had cut Dédaigneuses <b>running</b> <b>rigging</b> and sails [...] ). She had also suffered casualties with several men having been killed,and 17 wounded, [...] including her Captain and fifth Lieutenant. She then struck her colours. Unfavourable winds kept Amethyst, from getting up before Dédaigneuse had struck. Sirius was the only British ship to sustain any damage (rigging, sails, main-yard and bowsprit) in the encounter {{and there were no}} fatalities on the English side. Captain Linzee declared the encounter a long and anxious chase of 42 hours and acknowledged a gallant resistance on the part of Dédaigneuse. At the time of the encounter she was armed with twenty-eight 12-pounder guns. Linzee described her as [...] "a perfect new Frigate, Copper fastened and sails well...". He sent her into Plymouth with a prize crew under the command of his first lieutenant, H. Lloyd. The Admiralty took Dédaigneuse into the Royal Navy under the same name HMS Dedaigneuse.|$|E

50|$|After {{switching}} {{allegiance to}} the Los Angeles crime family, Milano became a made man in 1970. Soon after, {{he was promoted to}} caporegime (captain) in the family. His father Anthony, while also being one of the main criminal powers in Cleveland, also had interests on the West Coast and was closely associated with the L.A family. In March 1973, Milano and six others were charged with <b>running</b> a <b>rigged</b> gambling operation in Los Angeles that brought in up to $250,000 a month. Their trial was delayed when the key informant and witness, former Mafia associate John Dubcek, was shot and killed in Las Vegas. Although this scared other informants from testifying, Milano was still sentenced to four years in prison. Months later Milano and 11 other men were indicted for conspiracy, racketeering and extortion against bookmakers, loan sharks, and pornographers. Milano served four years for both indictments.|$|R

Then, squire, it is generally consaited among us in Ameriky, that we speak much the best English a-going; and sure am I, that none on us call a 'hog' an ''og,' an 'anchor' a 'hanchor,' or a 'horse' an ''orse.'

60|$|Iron is now {{employed}} {{in almost every}} part of a war-ship, the masts themselves being in many cases of iron--hollow tubes through which the <b>running</b> <b>rigging</b> may be let down when there is danger of its being damaged by the enemy's fire. The majority of modern ironclads are built in compartments, with this advantage that, if damage is sustained {{in one part of}} the vessel, and the water rush in through the gap made by shot or any other cause, the ship will still float until the water can be let out again.|$|E

40|$|High speed trains {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of the transportation systems around the world. With increasing speed, very high velocities are generated in the region around the train known as slipstream. Experimental studies have been conducted over the last few decades to study the effect of these phenomena. Slipstream velocities have been measured using anemometers placed near real trains running on the tracks and model trains <b>running</b> on <b>rigs</b> like moving model rig and rotating rail rig. However, most of these studies are quite expensive to conduct. The purpose of this thesis is to find an alternative way to measure the slipstream. Detached Eddy Simulation is used to simulate the flow around a 1 : 15 scaled model of an ETR 500 high speed train with different configurations similar to tests conducted on the track and in the wind tunnel. The results from the simulations are compared with the data obtained from experimental tests conducted on the Torino-Novara high speed line. A wind tunnel test is also carried out to validate the CFD data. It is concluded from the results that the wind tunnel setup with a slip floor in front of the train can be used to find out if the train produces slipstream velocities that are within the limits indicated by the TSI standards...|$|R
5000|$|New {{materials}} {{also changed}} sail designs, particularly on hybrid vessels carrying some square-rigged sails. The low aspect ratio of square-rigged sails (usually [...] to [...] ) produces much drag for the lift (motive power) produced, {{so they have}} poor performance to windward compared to modern yachts, and they cannot sail {{as close to the}} wind. The Bermuda rig is the (nearly) undisputed champion of windward performance in soft sails, due to its very low drag and high lift-to-drag ratio. One advantage of square rigs is that they are more efficient when running, where the high lift to drag is irrelevant and the total drag is the most important issue. Square-rigged sails are also less prone to broaching when <b>running</b> than Bermuda <b>rigs.</b> Ocean-going vessels take advantage of e.g. the trade winds and the westerlies and are thus mostly running.|$|R
60|$|All this {{appeared}} {{to me to be}} the work of only a minute. I had scrambled to windward, {{to get out of the}} way of the wreck, and stood with one foot on the upper side of the bitts, holding on, to steady myself, by some of the <b>running</b> <b>rigging.</b> This was being in a very different attitude, but on the precise spot, where, two or three hours before, I had called on the Almighty to pour out his vials of wrath upon the vessel, myself, and all she contained! At that fearful instant, conscience pricked me, and I felt both shame and dread, at my recent language. It seemed to me as if I had been heard, and that my impious prayers were about to be granted. In the bitterness of my heart, I vowed, should my life be spared, never to be guilty of such gross profanity, again.|$|E
60|$|At last, one man, {{alone in}} a small canoe, took the letter and started. Waiting for relief, work went on {{steadily}} on the Minota. Her water-tanks were emptied, and spars, sails, and ballast started shoreward. There were lively times on board when the Minota rolled one bilge down and then the other, a score of men leaping for life and legs as the trade-boxes, booms, and eighty-pound pigs of iron ballast rushed across from rail to rail and back again. The poor pretty harbour yacht! Her decks and <b>running</b> <b>rigging</b> were a raffle. Down below everything was disrupted.

60|$|By {{this time}} it was so late and so dark, that Captain Truck {{determined}} to suspend his labours until morning. In the course of a few hours of active toil, he had secured all the yards, the sails, the standing and <b>running</b> <b>rigging,</b> the boats, and many of the minor articles of the Dane; and nothing of essential importance remained, but the three lower masts. These, it is true, were all in all to him, for without them he would be but little better off than he was before, since his own ship had spare canvas and spare yards enough to make a respectable show above the foundation. This foundation, however, was the great requisite, and his principal motive in taking the other things, was to have a better fit than could be obtained by using spars and sails that were not intended to go together.|$|E
40|$|A {{flexible}} shaft {{is prone to}} a number of vibration phenomena which occur at frequencies other than synchronous with rotational speed. Nonsynchronous vibrations from several sources were observed while <b>running</b> a test <b>rig</b> designed to simulate the operation of a supercritical power transmission shaft. The test rig was run first with very light external damping and then with a higher level of external damping, for comparison. As a result, the effect of external damping on the nonsynchronous vibrations of the test rig was observed. All of these nonsynchronous vibrations were of significant amplitude. Their presence in the vibrations spectra for a supercritical power transmission shaft at various speeds in the operating range indicates that very careful attention to all of the vibration spectra should be made in any supercritical power transmission shafting. This paper presents a review of the analysis performed and a comparison with experimental data. A thorough discussion of the observed nonsynchronous whirl is also provided...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{ultrasonic}} sensor technology to detect incipient and evolving defects in rotating components such as bearings and gears is more desirable {{due to their}} high resolution. In a previous study, the sensitivity {{of a variety of}} sensors including an air-coupled ultrasound transducer to bearing faults was analyzed and thoroughly discussed. This article investigates the effectiveness of two {{ultrasonic sensor}}s, namely, air-coupled and piezoelectric ultrasound transducers for rolling element bearings damage diagnostics. The former is a noncontact sensor and the latter is a contact sensor. An accelerometer was also used as the baseline sensor for comparison purposes. A series of tests was carried out on a laboratory test <b>rig</b> <b>running</b> with defective and undamaged healthy bearings under variable shaft speeds and several radial loads. The data were analyzed using selected signal processing techniques covering time, frequency, and advanced joint time-frequency domains. The results showed that certain acoustic features were responsive to the variation of operational condition and the damage; the detection capability of the sensors varied depending on the defect size, its location, as well as the applied signal analysis technique. 9 2011 Crown Copyright.

6000|$|But {{the first}} time we reefed top-sails of a dark night, and I found myself hanging over the yard with eleven others, the ship {{plunging}} and rearing like a mad horse, till I felt like being jerked off the spar; then, indeed, I thought of a feather-bed at home, and hung on with tooth and nail; with no chance for snoring. But a few repetitions, soon made me used to it; and before long, I tied my reef-point as quickly and expertly as the best of them; never making what they call a [...] "granny- knot," [...] and slipt down on deck by the bare stays, instead of the shrouds. It is surprising, how soon a boy overcomes his timidity about going aloft. For my own part, my nerves became as steady as the earth's diameter, and I felt as fearless on the royal yard, as Sam Patch on the cliff of Niagara. To my amazement, also, I found, that <b>running</b> up the <b>rigging</b> at sea, especially during a squall, was much easier than while lying in port. For as you always go up on the windward side, and the ship leans over, it makes more of a stairs of the rigging; whereas, in harbor, it is almost straight up and down.|$|R
