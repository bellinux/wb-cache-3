5|$|The most {{commonly}} recurring debate in primatology during the 1970s, 1980s, and early 2000s concerned the phylogenetic position of tarsiers compared to both simians {{and the other}} prosimians. Tarsiers are most often placed in either the suborder Haplorhini with the simians or in the suborder Prosimii with the strepsirrhines. Prosimii {{is one of the}} two traditional primate suborders and is based on evolutionary grades (groups united by anatomical traits) rather than phylogenetic clades, while the Strepsirrhini-Haplorrhini taxonomy was based on evolutionary relationships. Yet both systems persist because the Prosimii-Anthropoidea taxonomy is familiar and frequently seen in the <b>research</b> <b>literature</b> and textbooks.|$|E
5|$|Unlike true fungi, {{the cell}} walls of oomycetes contain {{cellulose}} and lack chitin. Hyphochytrids have both chitin and cellulose. Slime molds lack a cell wall during the assimilative phase (except labyrinthulids, {{which have a}} wall of scales), and ingest nutrients by ingestion (phagocytosis, except labyrinthulids) rather than absorption (osmotrophy, as fungi, labyrinthulids, oomycetes and hyphochytrids). Neither water molds nor slime molds {{are closely related to}} the true fungi, and, therefore, taxonomists no longer group them in the kingdom Fungi. Nonetheless, studies of the oomycetes and myxomycetes are still often included in mycology textbooks and primary <b>research</b> <b>literature.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} and empirically {{supported}} method for assessing attachment in infants (11 months–17 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by Mary Ainsworth {{as a result of}} her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Baltimore, USA (see below). The Strange Situation Protocol is a research tool that was not intended for diagnostic purposes. While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the psychiatric diagnosis 'Reactive Attachment Disorder (RAD)'. The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the <b>research</b> <b>literature.</b> This is not to suggest that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and attachment disorder are not synonymous.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{published}} <b>research</b> <b>literatures</b> could be also utilized as an excellent indicator for technology level assessment (Garfield and Welljams-Dorof 1992). Even though, numbers of scientific literatures {{have traditionally been}} regarded {{as an indicator of}} the productivity, quality of these works should not be overlooked. Such qualitative analysis however, is mostly performed by experts in the field thus is an often time-consuming and expensive process. In order to overcome these limitations, advent of citation databases, which track how often articles are referenced in subsequent publications, and by whom, have created new tools for indicating the impact of primary <b>research</b> <b>literatures.</b> By aggregating citation data, it is then possible to indicate the relative impact of individuals, journals, departments, institutions, and nations. In addition, the citation data can be used to identify emerging specialties, new technologies and even the structure of various research disciplines, fields, and science as a whole.|$|R

25|$|Despite the {{therapeutic}} effectiveness and proven success of CBT, treatment availability is significantly limited {{by a lack}} of trained clinicians, poor geographical distribution of knowledgeable professionals, and expense.

However, property 9 above, automatic resolution of global deadlocks, has not been noticed for SS2PL in the database <b>research</b> <b>literature</b> until today (2009; except in the CO publications).

25|$|Many common {{depictions of}} the Electromagnetic Spectrum show gamma rays as higher in energy (hence are higher in {{frequency}} and smaller in wavelength) than X-rays. This historically allowed {{a clear distinction between}} X-rays and gamma rays. Today, the <b>research</b> <b>literature</b> often describes photons depending on their source. While astronomers usually hold to the historical convention (often the source or production mechanism of the radiation is unknown), the physics literature often use the term historically associated with the method of production. For example, one group of scientists might describe a 1 MeV photon as a gamma ray, while another group use the term X-ray.|$|E

Understandably, the area of leadership motivation draws heavily from the abundant <b>research</b> <b>literature</b> {{in the domain of}} motivation in I/O psychology. Because leaders are held responsible for their followers' ability to achieve the organization's goals, their ability to motivate their followers is a critical factor of leadership effectiveness. Similarly, the area of team leadership draws heavily from the research in teams and team effectiveness in I/O psychology. Because organizational employees are frequently structured in the form of teams, leaders {{need to be aware of}} the potential benefits and pitfalls of working in teams, how teams develop, how to satisfy team members' needs, and ultimately how to bring about team effectiveness and performance.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} some {{confusion}} about the biological effects of synephrine because of the similarity of this un-prefixed name to the names m-synephrine, Meta-synephrine and Neosynephrine, all of which refer to a related drug and naturally-occurring amine more commonly known as phenylephrine. Although there are chemical and pharmacological similarities between synephrine and phenylephrine, they are nevertheless different substances. The confusion {{is compounded by the}} fact that synephrine has been marketed as a drug under numerous different names, including Sympatol, Sympathol, Synthenate, and oxedrine, while phenylephrine has also been called m-Sympatol. The synephrine with which this article deals is sometimes referred to as p-synephrine in order to distinguish it from its positional isomers, m-synephrine and o-synephrine. A comprehensive listing of alternative names for synephrine may be found in the ChemSpider entry (see Chembox, at right).
