30|$|It is {{interesting}} to identify as to why small-animal NEMA standards exist for PET and not for SPECT. My personal feeling is {{that this might be}} attributed to the much larger variety in parameters with regard to equipment hardware and acquisition and reconstruction settings in small-animal SPECT as compared to PET. These include, for instance, static versus rotating collimators, planar or cylindrical collimators, numbers <b>of</b> pinholes, varying <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> or collimator diameters, using separated or overlapping projections, etc. The variety of photon energy, as opposed to the fixed value of 511  keV in PET, requires different (pinhole) collimator designs. Moreover, attenuation correction in single-photon detection is more of a challenge than in coincidence detection of two collinear photons. All these items could have led to more difficult ‘consensus’ in NEMA standards for small-animal SPECT than for small-animal PET.|$|R

5000|$|The {{engineering}} {{challenges of}} creating a rotating spacecraft are comparatively modest to any other proposed approach. Theoretical spacecraft designs using artificial gravity have {{a great number of}} variants with intrinsic problems and advantages. The formula for the centripetal force implies that the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> grows with the square of the orbital period, so a doubling of the orbital period requires a fourfold increase in the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b> For example, to produce standard gravity, [...] = [...] with an orbital period of 15 s, the <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> would have to be 56 m, while an orbital period of 30 s would require it to be 224 m. To reduce mass, the support along the diameter could consist of nothing but a cable connecting two sections of the spaceship, possibly a habitat module and a counterweight consisting of every other part of the spacecraft. It is not yet known whether exposure to high gravity for short periods of time is as beneficial to health as continuous exposure to normal gravity. It is also not known how effective low levels of gravity would be to countering the adverse effects on health of weightlessness. Artificial gravity at 0.1g and an orbital period of 30 s would require a radius of only 22 m. Likewise, at a radius of 10 m, an orbital period of just over 6 s would be required to produce standard gravity (at the hips; gravity would be 11% higher at the feet), while 4.5 s would produce 2g. If brief exposure to high gravity can negate the health effects of weightlessness, then a small centrifuge could be used as an exercise area.|$|E

30|$|Although {{outside the}} scope of this study, it is worth {{mentioning}} that there are further confounding aspects encountered in routine clinical investigations which have an effect on resolution and SBR quantification. Tremor-related patient movements and <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> larger than that standard 15  cm used for the ENC-DAT database, sometimes necessary to accommodate for patient anatomy or claustrophobia, may lead to significant reductions of the SBR [19 – 21]. In particular, the radius-dependence of the SBR should be considered as a “second order” effect which the phantom calibration cannot correct for, and whose severity depends on both reconstruction and quantification methods. While the Southampton method was found to be not affected by it, the use of morphological VOIs led to a loss of approximately 3 % per cm additional radius [21], which should be taken in consideration when using the ENC-DAT database in clinical practice.|$|R

For a given angular velocity the amount of artificial gravity depends linearly on the radius. With a small <b>radius</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation,</b> the amount of gravity felt at one's head would be {{significantly different from the}} amount felt at one's feet.

The L-SPECT system consists of an array of 100 × 100 micro range diameter pinholes. The proposed detector module has a 48 mm by 48 mm active area and the system is based on a pixelated array of NaI crystals (10 × 10 × 10 mm elements) coupled with an array of position sensitive photomultiplier tubes (PSPMTs). The performance of this system was evaluated with pinhole <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> 50 μm, 60 μm and 100 μm. Monte Carlo simulation studies using the Geant 4 Application for Tomographic Emission (GATE) software package validate the performance of this novel dual head L-SPECT system where a geometric mouse phantom is used {{to investigate}} its performance. All SPECT data were obtained using 120 projection views from 0 ° to 360 ° with a 3 ° step. Slices were reconstructed using conventional filtered back projection (FBP) algorithm. We have evaluated the quality of the images in terms of spatial resolution (FWHM) based on line spread function, the system sensitivity, the point source response function and the image quality. The sensitivity of our newly proposed L- SPECT system was about 4500 cps/μCi at 6 cm along with excellent full width at half-maximum (FWHM) using 50 μm pinhole aperture at several <b>radii</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b> The analysis results show the combination of excellent spatial resolution and high detection efficiency over an energy range between 20 - 160 keV. The results demonstrate that SPECT imaging using a pixelated L-SPECT detector module is applicable in a quantitative study of mouse brain imaging. © (2016) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).
