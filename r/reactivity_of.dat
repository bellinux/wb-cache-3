5|$|Because of {{the high}} <b>reactivity</b> <b>of</b> the metal, {{toxicological}} data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, blindness and sensitization.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the great}} <b>reactivity</b> <b>of</b> atomic nitrogen, {{elemental}} nitrogen usually occurs as molecular N2, dinitrogen. This molecule is a colourless, odourless, and tasteless diamagnetic gas at standard conditions: it melts at −210°C and boils at −196°C. Dinitrogen is mostly unreactive at room temperature, {{but it will}} nevertheless react with lithium metal and some transition metal complexes. This is due to its bonding, which is unique among the diatomic elements at standard conditions in that it has an N≡N triple bond. Triple bonds have short bond lengths (in this case, 109.76pm) and high dissociation energies (in this case, 945.41kJ/mol), and are thus very strong, explaining dinitrogen's chemical inertness.|$|E

5|$|Hexagonal BN (h-BN) is {{the most}} widely used polymorph.

Another advantage of h-BN over graphite is that its lubricity does not require water or gas molecules trapped between the layers. Therefore, h-BN lubricants can be used even in vacuum, e.g. in space applications. The lubricating properties of fine-grained h-BN are used in cosmetics, paints, dental cements, and pencil leads.|$|E
5|$|Irreversible {{competitive}} antagonists also involve {{competition between}} the agonist and antagonist of the receptor, but the rate of covalent bonding differs and depends on affinity and <b>reactivity</b> <b>of</b> the antagonist. For some antagonist, {{there may be a}} distinct period during which they behave competitively (regardless of basal efficacy), and freely associate to and dissociate from the receptor, determined by receptor-ligand kinetics. But, once irreversible bonding has taken place, the receptor is deactivated and degraded. As for non-competitive antagonists and irreversible antagonists in functional assays with irreversible competitive antagonist drugs, there may be a shift in the log concentration–effect curve to the right, but, in general, both a decrease in slope and a reduced maximum are obtained.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group; chemical properties of both actinium and especially lawrencium are not well-characterized. The remaining elements of the group (scandium, yttrium, lutetium) are reactive metals with high melting points (1541°C, 1526°C, 1652°C respectively). They are usually oxidized to the +3 oxidation state, even through scandium, yttrium and lanthanum can form lower oxidation states. The <b>reactivity</b> <b>of</b> the elements, especially yttrium, is not always obvious due to the formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. Scandium(III) oxide, yttrium(III) oxide, lanthanum(III) oxide and lutetium(III) oxide are white high-temperature-melting solids. Yttrium(III) oxide and lutetium(III) oxide exhibit weak basic character, but scandium(III) oxide is amphoteric. Lanthanum(III) oxide is strongly basic.|$|E

40|$|A {{detailed}} atmospheric photochemical mechanism {{which had}} been previously used in model calculations for developing ozone reactivity scales for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) was evaluated by comparing its predictions with measurements <b>of</b> incremental <b>reactivities</b> in an environmental chamber system. An updated version of this mechanism is also described and evaluated. The experiments consisted of determining the effects of adding representative alkanes, alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes or CO on NO oxidation, ozone formation and radical levels in a simplified model photochemical smog system representing conditions where ozone formation is most sensitive to VOCs. The published mechanism correctly simulated the observed qualitative reactivity trends, but overpredicted {{the effect of adding}} formaldehyde early in the experiments, performed poorly in simulating <b>reactivities</b> <b>of</b> branched alkanes, tended to underpredict the <b>reactivities</b> <b>of</b> alkenes, and did not simulate differences in <b>reactivities</b> <b>of</b> aromatic isomers.

5|$|The melting and boiling {{points of}} iodine {{are the highest}} among the halogens, {{conforming}} to the increasing trend down the group, since iodine has the largest electron cloud among them {{that is the most}} easily polarised, resulting in its molecules having the strongest van der Waals interactions among the halogens. Similarly, iodine is the least volatile of the halogens.

40|$|A {{competitive}} labelling method (Kaplan et al., 1971), using tritiated 1 -fluoro- 2, 4 -dinitrobenzene as the labelling reagent, {{is described}} {{for determining the}} ionization constants and <b>reactivities</b> <b>of</b> individual histidine residues in proteins. When this method {{was applied to the}} two histidines of α-chymotrypsin, histidine- 57 was found to have pKa 6. 8 and a reactivity ten times that of α-N-acetyl-l-histidine. Histidine- 40 had pKa 6. 7 and a reactivity approximately six times that of α-N-acetyl-l-histidine. Between pH 7. 5 and 8 the <b>reactivities</b> <b>of</b> both histidines decrease simultaneously to approximately that of α-N-acetyl-l-histidine. The high <b>reactivities</b> <b>of</b> the histidines are attributed to hydrogen bonding, which increases the nucleophilicity of the imidazole ring. The sharp decrease in reactivity between pH 7. 5 and 8 is attributed to a conformational change that disrupts the hydrogen bonding by these residues.

5|$|The {{relative}} <b>reactivity</b> <b>of</b> zinc and {{its ability}} to attract oxidation to itself makes it an efficient sacrificial anode in cathodic protection (CP). For example, cathodic protection of a buried pipeline can be achieved by connecting anodes made from zinc to the pipe. Zinc acts as the anode (negative terminus) by slowly corroding away as it passes electric current to the steel pipeline. Zinc is also used to cathodically protect metals that are exposed to sea water. A zinc disc attached to a ship's iron rudder will slowly corrode while the rudder stays intact. Similarly, a zinc plug attached to a propeller or the metal protective guard for the keel of the ship provides temporary protection.|$|E
5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent of}} chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and <b>reactivity</b> <b>of</b> chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and {{do not have to be}} distilled out.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of incandescent filaments, recrystallisation of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten sintering powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} thorium. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers. Thanks to the <b>reactivity</b> <b>of</b> thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E
