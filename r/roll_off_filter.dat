40|$|Radio over fiber (RoF) {{system is}} the most {{appropriate}} combination of fiber optic link and radio waves. Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) -RoF system can increase the capacity of modulation radio frequency (RF) access with high speed data transmission. The {{purpose of this paper}} is modeling and simulation an OFDM-RoF system for fiber length up to 100 km by using 16 -quadrature amplitude modulation (16 -QAM). OptiSystem 13 software is used for simulation. The proposed model of OFDM-RoF system uses two low pass cosine <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> <b>filter</b> (LP-CROF) as filter at the OFDM stage output and two LiNb-Mach Zehnder modulator (LiNb-MZM) as optical modulator. The results of simulation include the spectrum signal visualizers at the OFDM output, RF to optical upconventer (RTO) output as well as 16 -QAM received constellation. The results of simulation have shown that increasing of roll off factor value, it will be broadening in filter band transition. The proposed of RoF-OFDM system is able to achieve fiber length up to 100 km uses 16 QAM sequence bit, the received power is 71. 617 dBm with electrical and optical amplifications by using 10 Gbps data signal...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis article {{addresses}} a theoretical {{analysis of the}} Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of filtered single carrier modulations when Root-Raised Cosine (RRC) filters are considered. It is shown that two different behaviors occur for RRC filters when PAPR is derived, depending on the <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> factor, greater or not than a value around 0. 4. This analysis leads to an upper bound of the PAPR. Then, the influence of some parameters on the PAPR is analyzed, as the <b>roll</b> <b>off,</b> the <b>filter</b> length, the oversampling {{or the number of}} symbols. This study shows that PAPR distribution of single carrier signals weighted by a RRC filter is mainly influenced by the <b>roll</b> <b>off</b> factor, what has to be considered for efficient high power amplification...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} novel ultra-compact waveguide bandpass filters that exhibit pseudo elliptic responses with {{ability to}} place transmission zeros {{on both sides}} of the passband to form sharp <b>roll</b> <b>offs.</b> The <b>filters</b> contain E plane extracted pole sections cascaded with cross-coupled filtering blocks. Compactness is achieved by the use of evanescent mode sections and closer arranged resonators modified to shrink in size. The filters containing non-resonating nodes are designed by means of the generalized coupling coefficients (GCC) extraction procedure for the cross-coupled filtering blocks and extracted pole sections. We illustrate the performance of the proposed structures through the design examples of a third and a fourth order filters with center frequencies of 9. 2 GHz and 10 GHz respectively. The sizes of the proposed structures suitable for fabricating using the low cost E plane waveguide technology are 38 % smaller than ones of the E plane extracted pole filter of the same order...|$|R
