5|$|Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scotty {{to chop up}} {{her body}} with an axe and bury the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves {{to find a way}} back to town. When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she has already begun to turn. A badly-injured Scotty {{staggers}} into the cabin and dies of his wounds, having been attacked by the trees. While Ash tries {{to figure out what to}} do, both Linda and Cheryl pretend to be cured, only to quickly revert to their demonic forms. Ash locks Linda outside, but she returns and tries to stab him before he impales her with a dagger. He tries to cut up her remains with a chainsaw, but can't bring himself to do so, and ends up burying her instead. When he <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> necklace on the ground, she escapes again trying to kill him. Ash decapitates her with a shovel, and her headless body bleeds all over Ash's face as it tries to rape him before he escapes. Back in the cabin, he quickly realizes that Cheryl has forced open the trapdoor. After wounding her with a shotgun, he heads to the basement for more ammunition. There, the entity tortures him by dousing him with blood from a pipe, while more blood seeps from the walls and ceilings.|$|E
500|$|In 1984 Starkey {{was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and in 1994 a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He was also given an Honorary Fellowship at his Cambridge College, Fitzwilliam College. He {{has worked as}} curator on several exhibitions, {{including}} an exhibit in 2003 on Elizabeth I, following which he had lunch with her namesake, Elizabeth II. [...] Several years later he told a reporter that the monarch {{had no interest in}} her predecessors, other than those who followed her great grandfather. [...] "I don't think she's at all comfortable with anybody – I would hesitate to use the word intellectual – but it's useful. [...] I think she's got elements a bit like Goebbels in her attitude to culture – you remember: 'every time I hear the word culture I reach for my revolver.' [...] I think the queen <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> mask." [...] His remarks were criticised by Penny Junor, a royal biographer, and Robert Lacey, a royal historian.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} debuted at {{number one on}} MTV's TRL on March 2, 2001. The video begins with Spears and her boyfriend in a hammock. Cuts of her cuddling with her love {{interest}} beside a fire are also included. We also see her and her boyfriend on the seashore doing a love scene. Inside a tiki hut, Spears exclaims the words she wants her boyfriend to know. In {{the second half of}} the video, she is seen on a tree where her boyfriend <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> There are also scenes where she is running on the beach and her boyfriend is chasing after her. Spears wears only a bikini top and a pair of cutoff shorts during the whole video. The music video was considered by Spears as [...] "the funnest video I've ever done." [...] An alternate footage of the video can be found on the DVD of Spears first compilation album [...] Vineyard considered the footage as the one that [...] "makes the most use of Britney's body of work, with the spaceman from [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again", an opening door from [...] "My Prerogative" [...] and one love interest from [...] "Toxic" [...] all making cameos".|$|E

6000|$|... "So--help--me--God!" [...] he whispered, {{with blood}} thick in his voice. Then darkly, as one groping, he <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> with shaking hands. [...] "Y'u--y'u white-throated hussy!... I'll ..." ...|$|R
6000|$|MOTHER. [...] "Any life." [...] Even so! And then we {{can write}} to him quickly that we have taken our revenge quickly. [She <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> husband's rifle which she passes over to her son, who {{stretches}} his hand towards it with a glance at his father.] ...|$|E
6000|$|COMTESSE. Mrs. Shand, {{excuse me}} for saying that if half of what I hear be true, your husband is seeing that lady a great deal too often. [MAGGIE is expressionless; she <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> stocking, whereat her guest loses patience.] Oh, mon Dieu, put that down; you can buy them at two francs the pair. Mrs. Shand, why do not you compel {{yourself}} to take an intelligent interest in your husband's work? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was all-important. When a woman {{thinks that}} her house is on fire, her {{instinct}} {{is at once}} to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In {{the case of the}} Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> jewel-box. Now {{it was clear to me}} that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all." ...|$|E
6000|$|The mother, {{reading the}} {{disappointment}} and suffering in Helen's white face, <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> tremulously and drew {{her to her}} bosom. [...] "Never mind what they say, Nellie; it was beautiful and it was true." ...|$|R
6000|$|One {{night as}} she was passing his chair he <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and caught her and drew her down upon his knee. [...] "Sit ye down a wink. Ye're always on the move like a flibberty-bidget." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I can't walk any. Oh, I {{guess it}} will be all right when I get going again." [...] She tried to smile at him, and with the {{slowness}} of pain she <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> bundle.|$|R

5000|$|... #Caption: Veronica <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> {{car keys}} as the Hearst serial rapist approaches. Director Harry Winer created the {{sequence}} with fast cutting and quick dissolves {{in order to}} give the episode a visually complex scene, an aspect of production which series creator Rob Thomasthought was often neglected on the show.|$|E
50|$|Oftentimes, Madison has various, {{frequent}} dreams; everything being upside down, a {{girl whose}} mouth is taped and one hand <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> {{walks through the}} hall with dripping water and weird light bulbs.

5000|$|A Japanese {{rock garden}} lies {{outside in the}} {{background}} of the Fūryū Zashiki Hakkei version, in which a middle-aged man has his beard plucked by a young woman. The man has one arm around the woman and <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> kimono as they kiss. Hayakawa assumes the young woman is the man's mistress, and interprets her as the [...] "distant bay" [...] to whom the older man [...] "returns", or as the male ship pulling into the female harbour.|$|E
50|$|David {{has added}} two more angels to van Eyck's scene, {{and sets the}} figures in a {{recognisable}} contemporary location. The figures of Mary and Jesus are near identical in both works, from the vertical folds of Mary's dress, to the raised knee and arms of Jesus, with one arm reaching over his mother's shoulder, while the other <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> neck. van Eyck's work {{was influenced by the}} Icons of Byzantine art, and this influence carries through to Gerard's piece.|$|E
6000|$|Robina was {{quartered}} upon Geraldine in {{the holiday}} crowding of the house; and somewhere about four o'clock on the summer morning, Cherry, wakening as usual, and <b>reaching</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> book, heard {{a voice from the}} corner asking if she wanted anything. 'No, thank you, Bobbie. Go to sleep again.' ...|$|R
60|$|Carol <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> blouse, {{which hung}} on a chair by the bed. She draped it about her shoulders, and sat up {{studying}} Kennicott, her chin in her hands. In the gray light from the small electric bulb down the hall {{she could see that}} he was frowning.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the slight}} sharp twing was repeated. It {{seemed to come}} from outside her flesh. She shivered a little, {{thinking}} it might be a centipede. When she <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> shoulder her hand came in contact with a slender stick that had been thrust through a crack between the boards. Jim was trying to rouse her. This had been his method on several occasions when she had fallen asleep after waiting long for him.|$|R
50|$|The room {{actually}} {{appears to}} stretch and the paintings grow taller — revealing Melanie {{is in some}} haunting situations including: having a picnic with her boyfriend as ants, along with a rattlesnake, scorpion, spider and beetle raid their food, riding a boat about to go down a vertical waterfall, picking roses from above a tombstone while a skeletal zombie emerges from the ground, gripping a small rake in one hand, and wading through a small stream as an aquatic monster <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> foot.|$|E

Morito has planned to murder Kesa {{just as she}} has plotted to kill him, but the audience is left in doubt as to who was the successful killer, the scene ends with Morito strangling Kesa as she <b>reaches</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> knife. Reality and truth depend on whose perspective one believes. Kesa sees murdering Morito {{as a way to}} cleanse herself of her guilt and shame, while Morito believes he is bringing justice to Kesa and renewing his honor.|$|E
50|$|While drunk, Captain Jonsen makes {{a sexual}} {{overture}} to Emily.

Emily later suffers an injury to her leg, in an accident caused by Rachel, and is confined to the captain's cabin. Meanwhile, Margaret, who has become alienated from the other children, becomes Otto's concubine and moves into his cabin.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>reached</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> jacket; and {{the waiter}} sprang forward {{and helped her}} on with it, prolonging the {{business}} needlessly. She wished him [...] "Good evening" [...] {{in a tone of}} distant hauteur, and led the way to the door. Outside the street was dim and silent. Joan held out her hand.|$|R

50|$|According to Cicero (On Divination, 2.41.85), {{the cult}} statue Jupiter-puer ("Jupiter, the Boy") stood {{directly}} {{adjacent to the}} site where the sacred lots of ancient Praeneste were first discovered inside a flint rock.
