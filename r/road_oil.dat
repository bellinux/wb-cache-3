50|$|Orie T. Dunlap, {{owner of}} Madison Construction Company, {{purchased}} a {{parcel of land}} outside of Edwardsville on Oct. 1, 1936 from George Foehrkolb to create a private lake subdivision. In April 1938, Dunlap also purchased an additional 42 acres outside of Edwardsville to form the lake space itself. Construction of the lake began on November 1940 and the first phase was completed in May 1941. The beginning of World War II halted the road construction around the lake because <b>road</b> <b>oil</b> was not available. After the war, construction was completed in 1946 and Dunlap began selling the 526 lots. At that time there were 252 lots along the 15 miles of lakefront. The subdivision was annexed to Edwardsville in 1977 in order for residents to receive federal and state grants to build a reliable sewer system.|$|E
40|$|The {{demand for}} asphalt and <b>road</b> <b>oil</b> heavily leverages local supply because {{the product is}} a hot binder of {{aggregates}} that form the final mix needed to pave roads. This paper discusses the supply chain characteristics of crude oil feedstock by considering the overall logistics of sourcing heavy crude oil domestically, or importing it from international trading partners. Heavy crude oil {{is a source of}} asphalt and <b>road</b> <b>oil</b> production. The study examines critical global and domestic logistics factors such as customs, regulations, security, environmental compliance, and natural events that will affect costs, schedules, and risks. The study provides a framework for decision-making in sourcing the feedstock. The study helps global logisticians and transportation managers improve strategic design and planning towards efficient sourcing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The world {{production}} {{petroleum bitumen}} for road construction is considered. The problems and {{prospects of the}} bitumen production {{in the world and}} Russia are shown. At present leading positions on Russian bitumen market occupy the companies Gazprom Oil, Rosneft and Lukoyl. They cover nearly 80 % of total volume of bitumen production in the RF. In world road construction practice the residual <b>road</b> <b>oil</b> bitumen is basically used, from which more than 80 % of motor roads are built in the west. The significant quality growth of oil bitumen {{was the result of the}} appearance of modified and polymeric-bitumen bindings(PBB). Amongst block polymer of the styrene (SBC - styrene block copolymer), used in road construction, the main modifier for production of polymer-modified bitumen in the world is butadiene styrene thermoelastolayer SBS (SBS - styrene butadiene styrene). In 2014 at Moscow NPZ the installation on production PMB of new generation G-Way Styrelf is launched. The installation was built by the joint-venture Gazprom Oil" and French concern Total and is considered to produce 60 thousand tons of PMB and 7 thousand tons of bitumen emulsion per annum. The production is realized in accordance with technology Styrelf, designed by concern Total and adapted to Russian climatic conditions. The Russian bitumen is in demand on foreign market as well.  </p...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs a {{consequence}} of wildlife habitat is in constant evolution, periodic monitoring is essential to assess habitat quality. In this study the change to the red-crowned crane habitat in the Yellow River Delta Nature Reserve (YRDNR) was detected from multi-temporal remote sensing data from 1992 to 2008 in a geographic information system (GIS). The changing quality of the habitat was evaluated from both physical constraint and human disturbance. The results indicate that potential habitat shank 37. 8 % during 1992 - 2001, but recovered 96. 8 % by 2008. Human disturbance in the forms of <b>roads,</b> <b>oil</b> wells and residential areas caused {{a high degree of}} behavioral fragmentation. Suitable habitat shrank by 1, 569 ha to a level below that of 1992 despite an increase of 4, 450 ha in potential habitat due to an increase of 6, 019 ha in fragmented areas. Therefore, efforts should also be directed at improving habitat quality by minimizing human activities in the Reserv...|$|R

40|$|The Great Silk Road (GSR) called so in {{the late}} 19 th century by German {{geographer}} Ferdinand von Richthofen started shaping in the 2 nd century B. C. In the minds of peoples the Silk Road is a generalized symbol of trade caravan routes crossing Central Asia, connecting until the 16 th century the Far East, in particular Japan, China, with Middle Asia. Appearance in the early 21 st century of new independent states in Central Asia along the GSR route was a powerful impetus for revival of the ancient trade route. In September 2013 Xi Jinping, President of the People's Republic of China, {{during his visit to}} the Central Asian countries offered the strategic concept of joint construction of the “economic corridor along the Silk Road” based on innovative cooperation in order to revive and consolidate the economic contacts among the Eurasian countries.
