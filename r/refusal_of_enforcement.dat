40|$|Based on a {{dysfunction}} detected {{during the}} surrender of a pursued person under the European Convention on Extradition, the European Union instituted a new procedure that is the European arrestwarrant. Because initially {{the provisions of the}} Framework Decision 2002 / 584 /JHA did not provide clear legal rules regarding which procedure to follow if the wanted person was not present at the trial, this situation was observed also by the European Court of Human Rights, it was amended and supplemented accordinglyby adopting the Framework Decision 2009 / 299 /JAI. The evaluation of the provisions of both acts highlights the existence of some incomplete legal rules, which in time they will cause some dysfunctions regarding the issuing and the enforcement of a European arrest warrant. We also consider modifying and expanding thelegal rules relating to mandatory and optional reasons for the <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> of a European arrest warrant, and the inclusion of educational deprivation of liberty measures in the category of the reasons that justify the request of the execution of a European arrest warrant. The originality of the work results from the analysis of the recent changes of the European legislative framework document and the critical opinions expressed about some stipulations, which in our opinion are incomplete. The paper can be useful not only for the Romanian legislator, but also for the European one, from the perspective of modifying the concerned legalacts and also the doctrine. It has a major importance in this domain for ensuring an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union...|$|E
40|$|The United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, {{also known}} as the New York Convention, is the {{backbone}} of the universal mechanism for the enforcement system of foreign arbitral awards. Despite its universal success, Yemen has yet to ratify the Convention. Although Yemen is introducing new legislation on international arbitration, this legislation fails to provide clear guidance on the grounds for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> of foreign arbitral awards, unlike those listed in Article V of the New York Convention, which constitutes the core of the Convention. This thesis aims to examine the grounds of invalidity of arbitration agreements, and the public policy violation embodied in Articles V(1) (a) and V(2) (b) of the Convention. It adopts doctrinal and functional comparative approaches that comprise theoretical discussion and interpretation, as well as application by the courts of contracting States- paying particular attention to English legal practice. This thesis then also critically analyses the corresponding provisions under the new Yemeni legislation. Through a careful comparative analysis, the thesis also seeks to evaluate the degree of compatibility between the grounds’ applications and the relevant principles in operation in Yemen, which are derivative from Islamic Shari 'ah law. The thesis finds that the new Yemen’s legislation on international arbitration has several shortcomings regarding the specific areas of the study, and it makes a set of recommendations for legislative improvement. Moreover, the thesis demonstrates how the Convention is compatible with Shari’ah principles, thereby showing that there are no considerable barriers to its ratification by Yemen. Ultimately, in order to rectify the shortcomings in Yemen’s impending legislation on international arbitration, it is recommended that the Yemeni government considers ratifying the New York Convention. This progressive step will help Yemen adopt a pro-enforcement policy towards foreign arbitral awards and establish Yemen as an arbitration-friendly jurisdiction...|$|E

40|$|The subject. This informational {{article is}} devoted to the peculiarities <b>of</b> {{recognition}} and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> international commercial arbitration awards according to different countries’ legislation and international legal regulation. The purpose of the article is to identify legal patterns <b>of</b> recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> international commercial arbitration awards in different countries. Methodology. The study is based on comparative law and formal law methods, analysis and synthesis. Results, scope <b>of</b> application. <b>Enforcement</b> <b>of</b> arbitral awards in foreign countries is ensured and guaranteed by multilateral conventions, bilateral treaties and national legislation. The New York Convention 1958 in a certain way limits the scope of legal protection of arbitral awards and leaves the procedure for recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> arbitral awards for consideration of the state court. The author analyses of differentiation of the recognition and <b>enforcement</b> regime <b>of</b> so-called "domestic" and "foreign" solutions of international commercial arbitration in terms of doctrinal approaches and practice of foreign countries. Special attention is given to the analysis of foreign arbitral awards <b>of</b> recognition and <b>enforcement</b> procedures is given to a denial <b>of</b> recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> foreign arbitral awards and their reasons. In spite of the explicit grounds for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> foreign arbitral awards in New York Convention 1958, some countries try to establish certain exceptions to the rule in the national legislation. Results may be applicable in improvement of international legal regulation. Conclusions. The courts of the countries – participants of the New York Convention 1958 cannot cancel the foreign arbitral award or revise it substantially. The refutation of this award is possible only in the court of the state in whose territory the relevant arbitral award was made, and such court is not formally bound by the rules of the New York Convention 1958, when deciding whether to cancel or modify the award. </p...|$|R
40|$|Settlements {{of federal}} civil actions may, but need not, {{be subject to}} later {{judicial}} enforcement. As recognized by the U. S. Supreme Court in Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Insurance Co., one significant limitation on enforcement proceedings is subject matter jurisdiciton because federal district courts are courts of limited jurisdiction. Under Kokkonen, enforcement jurisdiction may be independent, but usually is ancillary because state law claims typically are involved {{where there is no}} diversity <b>of</b> citizenship. Ancillary <b>enforcement</b> powers may be exercised by district courts either where claims were initially presented for adjudication and disputes arising from later settlements are factually interdependent, or where recognition <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> authority enables courts to function successfully, as when courts need to insure that their orders are not flouted or imperiled. Typically, enforcement authority is exercised so that the courts function successfully. Difficulties have surfaced regarding this ancillary settlement enforcement jurisdiction. They include how to incorporate settlement terms into court orders and how otherwise to retain jurisdiction, whether settlement disputes may prompt the reopening of judgments, and what contract laws and what procedures should apply when federal case settlements are enforced. There are additional troubles which have yet to surface significantly, including whether there is judicial discretion to refuse requests that future enforcement jurisdiction be retained and whether certain settlement disputes can prompt discretionary <b>refusals</b> <b>of</b> available <b>enforcement</b> jurisdiction. We believe new written federal laws are needed now to address many of these difficulties. Relevant lawmakers include both the U. S. Supreme Court, as promulgator of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and the Congress. We suggest amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on judgment entry, on judgments involving money and on permanent injunctions, {{as well as to the}} supplemental jurisdiction statute...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{a recent}} decision of 25 February 2014 {{issued by the}} European Court of Human Rights in the Avotiņš v. Latvia case (application no. 17502 / 07), now pending before the Grand Chamber, pursuant to Article 43, para. 1, of the European Convention of Human Rights (hereinafter: ECHR). In the above case the Court excluded that the Latvian courts, by ordering the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> a Cypriot judgment rendered in absentia and subject to Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> decisions in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I Regulation), have infringed Article 6, para. 1, of the ECHR, concerning {{the right to a}} fair trial. The article criticizes the assessment of the Strasbourg Court on the control performed by the requested Member State over the protection of the guarantees enshrined in Article 6, para. 1, of the Convention. In particular, it stresses that the judgment seems to have failed to comply with the Pellegrini v. Italy’s test in assessing the ‘indirect’ or par ricochet protection of the ECHR. Moreover, the paper points out that the Latvian courts have not properly verified the effective respect of the defendant’s right to a fair trial in absentia, according to the interpretation of the ground for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> decisions provided for by Article 34, para. 2, of the Brussels I Regulation. The Author finally highlights the limitations in which the European Court of Human Rights’ assessment may incur with regard to situations falling within the EU law’s scope of application...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which grounds for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> surrender act as obstacles to hinder or jeopardise the transfer of individuals from a State to the International Criminal Court. It also {{examines the}} extent to which grounds for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> extradition act as obstacles to hinder or jeopardise the transfer of individuals from the requesting State to the requested State. By scrutinizing both the vertical and the horizontal systems <b>of</b> <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> international criminal law, the dissertation investigates {{the extent to which}} obstacles to the surrender and/or extradition of individuals are unsurmountable or otherwise. The critical analysis is preceded by an examination of the concept of ‘core crimes’. The work contains a study of the State obligation to cooperate, it illustrates the extent to which such obligation is binding (both upon State Parties to the International Criminal Court and upon non-State Parties in certain circumstances), and portrays the consequences in cases of a breach thereof. Since the ensuing consequences do little to deter States from defaulting, the author identifies and explores new legal avenues which can serve to trigger the criminal liability of those who decide to withhold cooperation. Where grounds for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> extradition are invoked by States, some ideas are proposed to restrict their application and effect, without violating international human rights law. The prospective roles of domestic, hybrid, special and international courts (and tribunals) in the fight against impunity and for the purposes <b>of</b> the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> international criminal law are discussed and evaluated...|$|R

40|$|The parties select more {{adversarial}} arbitration process {{over other}} alternative dispute resolution methods mainly {{due to the}} enforceability of the arbitral award. If the arbitral award becomes unenforceable due to any reason, the selection of arbitral process is useless. In this scenario, aresearch was conducted specially {{to find out the}} most common ground on which local arbitral awards become unenforceable in Sri Lanka and to explore the reasons to occur the unenforceability under that most common ground with the expectation that this improved knowledge would assist to minimize the unenforceability of local arbitral awards. The research was conducted under the quantitative research approach. A cross-sectional, retrospective and non-experimental study design was adopted. The local arbitration cases registered at the High Court-Colombo during 2009 - 2012 for the setting aside or for the <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> the awards and the courts had completed the proceedings were selected as the convenient sample. The sample contained 910 cases. The data collection process was a two tiered process. In the first tier, a cross sectional survey was carried out at the High Court-Colombo to find out arbitral awards become unenforceable due to setting aside or <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>enforcement</b> by the High Court. If the judgment of the High Court was appealed to the Supreme Court the judgment of the Supreme Court was also considered. Through the first tier of data collection, it was found that non adherence to the enforcement procedure is the most common ground on which local arbitral awards become unenforceable in Sri Lanka. During the second tier of data collection, semi structured interviews were conducted with the parties who failed to enforce the arbitral award due to non adherence to enforcement procedure, those parties were mainly financial institutions and contained 16 organizations. Through the interviews it was found that performance defects of the legal counsel and the performance defects of the officer in charge of the case are the main reasons for the unenforceability of arbitral awards under the most common ground. Therefore it is recommended to establish proper reporting and monitoring systems within the organizations dealing with arbitration...|$|R

40|$|International {{arbitration}} is {{an integral}} element of the globalized modern economy. It is the principal method of resolving commercial disputes between States, individuals, and corporations in {{almost every aspect of}} international trade. Arbitration relies on the notion of party autonomy—that the parties to an agreement may freely choose the law applicable to their agreement and to the resolution of any dispute arising out of it. However, agreements have to be performed and arbitral awards rendered somewhere, and in the modern world in which the preeminent legal authority is the sovereign State, these actions necessarily occur under a legal framework and a public policy not shaped by the parties. When rules of public policy are implicated in the agreement underlying a dispute in arbitration—or in the award resulting from the for arbitration proceedings, a State must navigate between the Scylla and Charybdis of lending its authority to the recognition of an agreement or <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> an award contrary to its fundamental principles or of appearing not to respect the principle of finality of arbitral awards underpinning the system of modern international commerce. What route should national courts—the “watchmen of public policy”—choose? Should party autonomy cabined by respect for international public policy? Or should public policy be viewed as a safety valve utilized only in emergencies, where recognition and enforcement would be fundamentally at odds with a State’s most cherished principles and values? This thesis details the provisions for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> recognition or <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> arbitral awards on the grounds of public policy that currently exist in major international conventions and model legislation {{as well as in the}} legislation of the United States and selected European Union Member States. The various ways in which public policy can be understood is explained, and the application of the public policy exceptions in the United States and selected European Union Member States are detailed. Finally, trends in the United States and the European Union with respect to public policy and arbitration are examined...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} of European Private International Law (EPIL) have considerably enhanced {{the principle of}} mutual recognition {{in the framework of}} judicial cooperation in civil matters. With regard to the free movement of judicial and extrajudicial judgments, the general guidelines provided by the Tampere and Stockholm programmes have been pursued under two different directions. On the one hand, mutual recognition has been achieved by a partial or complete harmonization of procedural law (Regulation No 1896 / 2006 creating a European order for payment procedure; Regulation No 861 / 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure). On the other hand, mutual recognition has entailed a gradual abolition of all intermediate measures or proceedings for the recognition and <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> civil judgments issued by Member States (Regulation No 805 / 2004 on the European enforcement order for uncontested claims, and, partially, Regulation No 4 / 2009 on cross-border maintenance obligations). More recently, Regulation No 1215 / 2012 (Brussels I-bis) has provided for the direct <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> judgments given in another Member State without a declaration of enforceability (abolition of exequatur). Nevertheless, under some of these instruments there remain limits to mutual recognition. For instance, under Brussels I-bis, the person against whom enforcement is sought may apply for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> the recognition or <b>enforcement</b> <b>of</b> a judgment if he considers that one of the grounds for <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> recognition (e. g. public policy) is present. It is also possible to invoke the grounds for refusal available under the national law of the Member State <b>of</b> <b>enforcement.</b> The main purpose of the paper is to provide a coherent and comprehensive framework of the expansion of the principle of mutual recognition in EPIL instruments. It will then review the challenges posed by the (potential) extension of the principle on other sensitive areas of law, such as family matters and civil status documents...|$|R
