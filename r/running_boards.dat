25|$|The {{fourteen}} class F6 locomotives {{were not}} delivered from their builder, the Baldwin Locomotive Works of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, until 1929–1930. In 1931, eight sister locomotives of class F6-a were delivered; these differed in few aspects {{but can be}} distinguished by the straight <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> of the F6-a, {{in contrast to the}} stepped <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> of the F6.|$|E
25|$|Besides the gripman, each {{cable car}} carries a {{conductor}} {{whose job is}} to collect fares, manage the boarding and exiting of passengers, and control the rear wheel brakes when descending hills. With the common practice of carrying standing passengers on the <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> of cable cars, passenger management is an important task.|$|E

25|$|A {{major change}} in {{automobile}} design since World War II was the popularity of ponton style, in which <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> were eliminated and fenders were incorporated into the body. Among the first representatives of the style were the Soviet GAZ-M20 Pobeda (1946), British Standard Vanguard (1947), United States Studebaker Champion and Kaiser (1946), {{as well as the}} low-production Czech luxury Tatra T600 Tatraplan (1946) and the Italian Cisitalia 220 sports car (1947).|$|E
25|$|The pre-war part of {{the classic}} era began with the Great Depression in 1930, and ended with the {{recovery}} after World War II, commonly placed at 1946. It was in this period that integrated fenders and fully closed bodies began to dominate sales, with the new saloon/sedan body style even incorporating a trunk or boot at the rear for storage. The old open-top runabouts, phaetons, and touring cars were largely phased out {{by the end of}} the classic era as wings, <b>running</b> <b>boards,</b> and headlights were gradually integrated with the body of the car.|$|E

25|$|Not {{only did}} the weather {{frustrate}} efforts to reach the scene, but also it hampered the ability to fight the fire. Attempts to disconnect hoses to move them resulted in the water freezing and bursting the hoses; Since the street drains were blocked with snow, runoff water from the fire rose to the <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> on the fire department's pumpers. When this water froze, it required jackhammers to extricate the pumpers. Hoses also {{had to be removed}} with jackhammers. Some fire truck pumpers stalled in the snow when wind blew into the engines or they ran out of fuel. Since their design necessitated the use of water instead of antifreeze as a coolant, the water in the pumper froze and ruined them.|$|E
25|$|The vintage era {{lasted from}} the end of World War I (1918), through to the Wall Street Crash at the end of 1929. During this period the front-engined car came to {{dominate}} with closed bodies and standardised controls becoming the norm. In 1919, 90% of cars sold were open; by 1929, 90% were closed. Development of the internal combustion engine continued at a rapid pace, with multi-valve and overhead camshaft engines produced at the high end, and V8, V12, and even V16 engines conceived for the ultra-rich. Also in 1919, hydraulic brakes were invented by Malcolm Loughead (co-founder of Lockheed); they were adopted by Duesenberg for their 1921 Model A. Three years later, Hermann Rieseler of Vulcan Motor invented the first automatic transmission, which had two-speed planetary gearbox, torque converter, and lockup clutch; it never entered production. (Its like would only become an available option in 1940.) Just {{at the end of the}} vintage era, tempered glass (now standard equipment in side windows) was invented in France. In this era the revolutionary ponton design of cars without fully articulated fenders, <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> and other non-compact ledge elements was introduced in small series but mass production of such cars was started much later (after WWII).|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, several real-life criminals became celebrities. Two in {{particular}} captured the American imagination: Al Capone and John Dillinger.

500|$|The Wreck is {{distinguished}} by its old gold body and white soft top. The soft top has a chrome support strut, {{which features a}} brass classic Tech T and 1952 yellow jacket. The body also has two solid white runningboards, which run {{the length of the}} vehicle. The <b>running</b> <b>boards</b> support cheerleaders or the occasional Tech student looking for a ride. The interior upholstery is solid white vinyl. The gear shifter knob is a white globe with the classic Tech T painted on it.

500|$|As {{a member}} of the Nazi Party and the Abwehr {{intelligence}} service, Schindler was in danger of being arrested as a war criminal. Bankier, Stern, and several others prepared a statement he could present to the Americans attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives. He was also given a ring, made using gold from dental work taken out of the mouth of Schindlerjude Simon Jeret. The ring was inscribed [...] "Whoever saves one life saves the world entire." [...] To escape being captured by the Russians, Schindler and his wife departed westward in their vehicle, a two-seater Horch, initially with several fleeing German soldiers riding on the <b>running</b> <b>boards.</b> A truck containing Schindler's mistress Marta, several Jewish workers, and a load of black market trade goods followed behind. The Horch was confiscated by Russian troops at the town of Budweis, which had already been captured by Russian troops. The Schindlers were unable to recover a diamond that Oskar had hidden under the seat. They continued by train and on foot until they reached the American lines at the town of Lenora, and then travelled to Passau, where an American Jewish officer arranged for them to travel to Switzerland by train. They moved to Bavaria in Germany in the fall of 1945.|$|E

[...] Capone appeared {{on the cover of}} Time magazine in 1930. He was even offered seven figure sums by two major Hollywood studios to appear in a film but declined. Dillinger became a national celebrity as a bank robber who eluded arrest and escaped confinement several times. He had become the most celebrated public outlaw since Jesse James. His father appeared in a popular series of newsreels giving police homespun advice on how to catch his son. Dillinger's popularity rose so fast that Variety joked [...] "if Dillinger remains at large much longer and more such interviews are obtained, there may be some petitions circulated to make him our president." [...] Hays wrote a cablegram to all the studios in March 1934 decreeing that Dillinger should not be portrayed in any motion picture.|$|E

2500|$|The first Danish route, C99, {{opened in}} 2012 between the Vesterbro rail station in Copenhagen and Albertslund, a western suburb.

Similar projects have since been built in Germany among other countries.|$|E
5000|$|The fenders, or wings, of the 2/10 PS were {{integrated}} into the bodywork of the car, allowing the passenger space to be wider {{than it would have}} been with the traditional separate fenders and <b>running</b> <b>board.</b> [...] The compact drivetrain allowed the floor to be lower, making it possible to enter the car from the ground without a <b>running</b> <b>board.</b> The rounded appearance of the 2/10 PS, due to the envelope styling, earned it the nickname Kommissbrot after the inexpensive, flat-sided bread used by the military.|$|R

2500|$|Along with Oldsmobile, Pontiac had the {{distinction}} of having all three of General Motors' mainstream platforms in 1940, but this would last only one more year.
