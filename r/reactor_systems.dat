25|$|A {{nuclear reactor}} coolant — usually water but {{sometimes}} a gas or a liquid metal (like liquid sodium) or molten salt — is circulated past the reactor core {{to absorb the}} heat that it generates. The heat is carried away from the reactor and is then used to generate steam. Most <b>reactor</b> <b>systems</b> employ a cooling system that is physically separated from the water that will be boiled to produce pressurized steam for the turbines, like the pressurized water reactor. However, in some reactors the water for the steam turbines is boiled directly by the reactor core; for example the boiling water reactor.|$|E

40|$|Interconnecting {{fluidized}} beds is a {{well known}} principle, applied in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers (combustor-external cooler). The two reactors are connected by fluidised loop-seals which allow the material to circulate while the gases are kept separate (figure 1). This technique is as well the foundation for more recent developments such as, indirect gasification (IG) and chemical looping combustion (CLC) [1 - 3]. The insistence of a nitrogen free atmosphere during operation in IG and CLC, compared to CFB-boilers, puts elevated demands on tightness in loop-seals and the knowledge of fluid dynamics. A cold <b>reactor</b> <b>system</b> of interconnecting fluidised beds is built to study fluid dynamics of an equally sized hot <b>reactor</b> <b>system.</b> The hot <b>reactor</b> <b>system</b> is coupled to the raw gas line in Chalmers biomass Gasifier system [3], where the main emphasis of research is to study gas solid interactions. This hot <b>reactor</b> <b>system</b> will be taken into operation during autumn 2009. The perspex cold <b>reactor</b> <b>system</b> has been in operation during the summer 2009 with both air and helium as fluidising media. Helium {{is used as a}} complement to air, as the density and viscosity has better agreement with the gases in the hot system. Since helium is a much more expensive gas than pressurised air several experiments are performed to find a correlation between these. The research of the cold <b>reactor</b> <b>system</b> is focused on mapping pressure profiles in the system and solid rate circulation as a function of fluidisation velocity (u 0). The study shows that the Solid rate circulation can be sufficiently controlled with both u 0 in the inferior loop-seal and u 0 in the riser. It is also shown that experiments performed with air and helium can give sufficient agreement. Furthermore, the pressure signals are shown to give vital information regarding solid rate circulation and fluidisation regimes in the riser...|$|R
