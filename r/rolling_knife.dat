40|$|The {{coating of}} wood and wood panel {{surfaces}} basically serves for surface protection and its surface can be improved at various user areas. Different application methods are used for the coating of MDF surface. These are methods such as curtain coating, spraying, <b>rolling,</b> <b>knife,</b> etc. In this study, suitability of pigment coating method instead of the traditional surface coating methods used for coating MDF panels {{and the effects of}} fire retardants on surface properties of MDF coated by the best appropriate coating mixture was investigated. Calcite and clay were used as coating pigment and latex, urea formaldehyde, and melamine formaldehyde were used as adhesive. Coating/adhesive mixture obtained was applied to MDF panels with knives. Before the analysis, test samples were put to condition room and they were kept in there for 1 week. According to the results obtained, the best appropriate coating material was found as calcite. 22 % concentrated melamine formaldehyde as adhesive and 0. 25 mm as coating thickness was determined better than other combinations. Borax, boric acid and zinc borate as fire retardant were added to calcite /melamine formaldehyde with 22 % mixture. So, the effects of fire retardant on surface characterization were determined. Surface properties of coated MDF panels tested were found lower than standard requirements except for abrasion resistance...|$|E

[...] Hogan recalled. [...] "That was the woman who took care of us â€¦ she pretty much lived with us, I remember, for six to eight months, even after my mum {{returned}} home, because they got on." ...|$|R
50|$|The Porter, {{like the}} other rivers in Sheffield, is ideally suited for {{providing}} water power, as the final section falls some 450 ft in a little over 4 mi. This enabled dams to be constructed reasonably close together, without the outflow from one mill being restricted by the next downstream dam. In addition to this water-power, natural sandstone was available in abundance in the nearby hills of Sheffield and the Peak District National Park. Lying {{at the edge of}} these hills, mill-owners found Millstone Grit was an easily extractable resource. By 1740 Sheffield became the most extensive user of water-power in Britain and probably in Europe. Ninety mills had been built, two-thirds of them for grinding. By 1850 these mills numbered well over 100. In the Porter valley alone 21 mill dams served 19 water-wheels, mostly used for grinding corn, operating forge-hammers, and <b>rolling</b> mills, grinding <b>knives</b> and the various types of blade that made Sheffield famous. Most were active during the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|R
5000|$|On March 7, 2004, Crosby {{was charged}} with {{criminal}} possession of a weapon in the third degree, illegal possession of a hunting knife, illegal possession of ammunition, and illegal possession of about one ounce of marijuana. Crosby left said items behind in his hotel room. Authorities said a [...] "hotel employee searched the suitcase for identification and found about an ounce of marijuana, <b>rolling</b> papers, two <b>knives</b> and a [...]45-caliber pistol. Mr. Crosby was arrested {{when he returned to}} the hotel to pick up his bag." [...] After spending 12 hours in jail, he was released on $3,500 bail. On July 4, 2004, he pleaded guilty to attempted criminal possession of a weapon, was fined $5,000 and given no jail time. Prosecutors did not seek a more severe penalty on the weapons charge because the pistol was registered in California and was stowed safely in his luggage when it was found. A charge of unlawful possession of marijuana was dismissed. Crosby was discharged by the court on condition that he pay his fine and not get arrested again.|$|R
