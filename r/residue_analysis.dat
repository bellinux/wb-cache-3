All of these processes can help us to understand our human ancestors and how, why and when they created flake tools. These flake tools also have characteristics that show that these tools were made as a result of human work instead of natural processes. Each flake has 5 different parts: the first of which is a bulb of percussion which can also be known as the bulb of force. The next being an eraillure which is a flake that has been taken off of the lithic bulb of percussion. The third part of the flake is the radial fissures.

50|$|Symbolic {{of the new}} found {{prestige}} of forensics {{and the use of}} reasoning in detective work was the popularity of the fictional character Sherlock Holmes, written by Arthur Conan Doyle in the late 19th century. He remains a great inspiration for forensic science, especially for the way his acute study of a crime scene yielded small clues as to the precise sequence of events. He made great use of trace evidence such as shoe and tire impressions, as well as fingerprints, ballistics and handwriting analysis, now known as questioned document examination. Such evidence is used to test theories conceived by the police, for example, or by the investigator himself. All of the techniques advocated by Holmes later became reality, but were generally in their infancy at the time Conan Doyle was writing. In many of his reported cases, Holmes frequently complains of the way the crime scene has been contaminated by others, especially by the police, emphasising the critical importance of maintaining its integrity, a now well-known feature of crime scene examination. He used analytical chemistry for blood <b>residue</b> <b>analysis</b> as well as toxicology examination and determination for poisons. He used ballistics by measuring bullet calibres and matching them with a suspected murder weapon.|$|E
