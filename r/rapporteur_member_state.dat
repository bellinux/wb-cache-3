30|$|Within the European Union (EU), {{criteria}} for assessment of {{plant protection products}} (PPPs) for PBT or POP properties are given in EC Regulation No. 1107 / 2009 and assessments of individual COCs are conducted by <b>Rapporteur</b> <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> (RMS) of the EU {{in much the same}} way as registration of new active ingredients. There is no explicit framework or guidance for classification other than a draft document from the EU Directorate General for Health and Consumer Affairs (DG SANCO) [21], and, unlike REACH [7], there is no guidance for how studies are to be evaluated or how the relevance of the data in these studies is to be assessed. REACH recommends the use of a WoE approach for assessing data on chemicals in commerce but does not describe how this is to be done. EC Regulation No. 1107 / 2009 does not mention WoE at all. Under EC Regulation No. 1107 / 2009, if a PPP is classified as P, B, and/or T, exceeding trigger values for all three criteria ultimately results in a ban of the use of the product in the EU. Exceeding two of the criteria results in the PPP being listed for substitution with alternative pesticides that do not exceed established trigger values.|$|R

Each national report also outlined key aspects of the wider legal context within which private enforcement of competition law operates in that jurisdiction. The general hypothesis that underlies the dual approach to the project is that private enforcement practice across the legal systems of the EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> may at least partly be explained by the existence or availability of particular institutions, mechanisms and cultural factors in relation to the particular legal system. In this article we considered two particular institutions or mechanisms: the specialist court/tribunal and the competition litigation follow-on action mechanism.

It is not claimed that there are any direct causal relationships between the insights provided by the empirical data and the national narratives on institutional mechanisms, but the analysis indicates ways and contexts in which competition litigation cultures may develop in the wake of specific institutional mechanisms. The article concludes that it is inevitable that patterns of competition litigation will continue to vary considerably across the EU for the foreseeable future, reflecting, to a great extent, the variable landscape of legal and institutional provision for private enforcement in the EU <b>Member</b> <b>States...</b>|$|R

40|$|Following {{a review}} of all {{available}} studies, glyphosate, an active substance used in pesticides, has been assessed as non-carcinogenic for humans by the competent national, European and other international institutions for health assessment including the WHO/FAO Joint Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) based on the current data and the assumption of intended uses. The International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) recently classifies glyphosate as a carcinogenic substance in Group 2 A, in IARC words “Probably carcinogenic to humans”, based on the available and evaluated studies by IARC. This classification was initially published in a short report in the "Lancet Oncology" journal on 20 March 2015 but was not explained scientifically in detail. The full report on glyphosate from the IARC monograph (Volume 12) has been publicly available since 29 July 2015, and the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) is reviewing the monograph with regard to documentation that was previously not taken into account, the assessment findings, quality aspects and methodology. Germany – as the <b>rapporteur</b> <b>member</b> <b>state</b> for the active substance glyphosate {{within the framework of}} active substance approval - is also forwarding the findings to EFSA and ECHA.

The WG evaluates all of the publicly available scientific information on each substance and, through a transparent and rigorous process, 1 decides on {{the degree to which the}} scientific evidence supports that substance's potential to cause or not cause cancer in humans. For Monograph 112, 2 17 expert scientists evaluated the carcinogenic hazard for four insecticides and the herbicide glyphosate. 3 The WG concluded that the data for glyphosate meet the criteria for classification as a probable human carcinogen. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is the primary agency of the European Union for risk assessments regarding food safety.
