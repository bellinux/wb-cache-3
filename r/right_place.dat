On Sundays, Fellini and Basehart would drive around the countryside, {{scouting}} locations and looking for just the <b>right</b> <b>place</b> to eat, sometimes trying {{as many as six}} restaurants and venturing as far away as Rimini before Fellini could find the desired ambience and menu.|$|E
5|$|Vienna {{became the}} <b>right</b> <b>place</b> {{for such an}} initiative, since it was already the most {{important}} publishing centre for the Greek diaspora. In 1783 the Austrian Emperor had authorized the free printing of Greek books in the city, while in 1790 the first Greek newspaper, named Ephimeris, was published there.|$|E
5|$|Since the mid-1990s, BART {{has been}} trying to {{modernize}} its system. The fleet rehabilitation is part of this modernization; in 2009, fire alarms, fire sprinklers, yellow tactile platform edge domes, and cemented-mat rubber tiles were installed. The rough black tiles on the platform edge mark the location of the doorway of approaching trains, allowing passengers to wait at the <b>right</b> <b>place</b> to board. All faregates and ticket vending machines were replaced.|$|E

5|$|To fit {{the program}} into the 320 words {{available}} on the chip, some significant modification was used. By not using regular floating point numbers, which require lots of instructions to keep the decimal point in the <b>right</b> <b>place,</b> some space was freed up. Trigonometric functions were implemented in about 40 instructions, and inverse trigonometric functions are almost 30 more instructions. Logarithms are about 40 instructions, with anti-log about 20 on top of that. The code to normalize and display the computed values are roughly the same in both the TI and Sinclair programs.|$|E
5|$|Why {{they went}} to land {{in the first place}} is still debated. One reason could be that the small juveniles who had {{completed}} their metamorphosis had what it took to make use of what land had to offer. Already adapted to breathe air and move around in shallow waters near land as a protection (just as modern fish and amphibians often spend the first part of their life in the comparative safety of shallow waters like mangrove forests), two very different niches partially overlapped each other, with the young juveniles in the diffuse line between. One of them was overcrowded and dangerous while the other was much safer and much less crowded, offering less competition over resources. The terrestrial niche was also a much more challenging place for primary aquatic animals, but because of the way evolution and selection pressure work, those juveniles who could take advantage of this would be rewarded. Once they gained a small foothold on land, thanks to their preadaptations and being at the <b>right</b> <b>place</b> at the right time, favourable variations in their descendants would gradually result in continuing evolution and diversification.|$|E

In 1857, they had also built their first carriage—"Fancy, hand-worked iron trim, the kind of courting buggy any boy and girl would be proud to be seen in".|$|E

He was also compared to Bradman in his ability to keep the scoreboard moving and at using his feet to come down the pitch to slower bowlers. Additionally, Weekes was an excellent fielder, initially in the covers before moving into the slips, and produced a training manual entitled Aspects of Fielding.|$|E
