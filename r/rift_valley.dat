5|$|A. b. swaynei (Sclater, 1892) : Known as Swayne's hartebeest. Restricted to the {{southern}} <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley</b> in Ethiopia. It formerly occurred throughout the <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley,</b> and its range extended eastward into northwestern Somalia. It has disappeared from Somalia by 1930. Its populations are very low and on the decline.|$|E

5|$|Early genetic {{studies were}} focused on lions from eastern and {{southern}} parts of Africa, and already showed that lions can possibly be divided in two main clades: one {{to the west of}} the Great <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley</b> and the other to the east. Lions in eastern Kenya are genetically much closer to lions in South Africa than to lions in the Aberdare Range in western Kenya or in Uganda.|$|E
5|$|The Ethiopian hare is {{endemic to}} Africa, and {{is found in}} the Afromontane Biozone of Ethiopia, and in the borders of the Sudanian Savanna Biozone; it also occurs west of the <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley,</b> in the Ethiopian Highlands, and abundantly found around the Lake Tana in Ethiopia.

2500|$|About 180 {{million years}} ago, a mantle plume under {{southern}} Gondwana caused bulging {{of the continental}} crust {{in the area that}} would later become southern Africa. [...] Within 10–20 million years <b>rift</b> <b>valleys</b> formed {{on either side of the}} central bulge, which became flooded to become the proto-Atlantic and proto-Indian oceans. The stepped steep walls of these <b>rift</b> <b>valleys</b> formed escarpments that surrounded the newly formed Southern African subcontinent.|$|R
5|$|The Jackson's {{hartebeest}} {{does not}} have a clear taxonomic status. It is regarded as a hybrid between the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. The African Antelope Database (1998) treats it as synonymous to the Lelwel hartebeest. From Lake Baringo to Mount Kenya, the Jackson's hartebeest significantly resembles the Lelwel hartebeest, whereas from Lake Victoria to {{the southern part of the}} <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley</b> it tends to be more like the Coke's hartebeest.|$|E
5|$|The Central Lowlands is a <b>rift</b> <b>valley</b> mainly {{comprising}} Paleozoic formations. Many {{of these}} sediments have economic significance {{for it is}} here that the coal and iron bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's industrial revolution are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism, Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the Ochils and Campsie Fells are rarely far from view.|$|E
5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare is {{endemic to}} the central Ethiopian Highlands, occurring in the Afroalpine regions of Ethiopia. It occurs on the central plateau of the Shoa Province, and {{in the mountains of}} Bale and Arsi Province except in the Great <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley</b> which parts the two provinces. The complete distribution of the Ethiopian highland hare, according to Angermann, falls in between 6° 50' N and 9° 35' N latitudes, and 38° E and to slightly east of 40° E longitudes.|$|E

The Thetis Deep includes three en- echelon <b>rift</b> <b>valleys</b> that have joint together. Axial neovolcanic zones were observed {{in each of these}} <b>rift</b> <b>valleys,</b> together with large number of diffuse small volcanic cones. Both are made of fresh MORB type rocks. The walls of the <b>rift</b> <b>valleys</b> are formed by normal faulting with superimposed salt tectonics. Complex deformation patterns, partly also caused by salt tectonics, were observed at the transfer zone between Thetis and Nereus Deep to the north.

5|$|The geology of Scotland {{is unusually}} varied {{for a country}} of its size, {{with a large number}} of differing {{geological}} features. There are three main geographical sub-divisions: the Highlands and Islands is a diverse area which lies to the north and west of the Highland Boundary Fault; the Central Lowlands is a <b>rift</b> <b>valley</b> mainly comprising Paleozoic formations; and the Southern Uplands, which lie south of the Southern Uplands Fault, are largely composed of Silurian deposits.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecutor}} {{accused the}} defendants of forming an organisation {{along with other}} Kalenjin people as early as 2006 with the stated purpose of removing members of the Kikuyu, Kamba and Kisii ethnic groups from the <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley</b> region of Kenya to create a large pro-ODM power base in that region. To force these communities to relocate, the group planned to inflict fear and destroy homes and property until the victims left the region.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN {{currently}} recognizes {{only one}} species of giraffe with nine subspecies. In 2001, a two-species taxonomy was proposed. A 2007 {{study on the}} genetics of Giraffa, suggested they were six species: the West African, Rothschild's, reticulated, Masai, Angolan, and South African giraffe. The study deduced from genetic differences in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that giraffes from these populations are reproductively isolated and rarely interbreed, though no natural obstacles block their mutual access. This includes adjacent populations of Rothschild's, reticulated, and Masai giraffes. The Masai giraffe was also suggested to consist of possibly two species separated by the <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley.</b>|$|E

50|$|Between 425 and 370 {{million years}} ago, the two continents began to collide, forming Pangea. During this time, the Acadian orogeny, which marked the {{collision}} of the two continents, occurred. Around 200 million years ago, Pangea began to break apart. This caused <b>rift</b> <b>valleys</b> to form within {{the interior of the}} continent. One of these <b>rift</b> <b>valleys,</b> the Connecticut River Valley is a failed rift of the continent. Basalt dikes present in the underlying rocks of the valleys are the result of volcanism.|$|R
50|$|The Northern Province lies {{mainly on}} the great {{southern}} African plateau which has been uplifted to an elevation around 1200 metres above sea level. <b>Rift</b> <b>valleys</b> extend clockwise around the province from the north-west to the south. These <b>rift</b> <b>valleys</b> are sometimes outside {{the borders of the}} province, {{as in the case of}} the Luapula-Mweru valley to the north-west and the Lake Rukwa and Lake Malawi <b>rift</b> <b>valleys</b> to the north east; but the escarpments of the Lake Mweru-wa-Ntipa-Lake Tanganyika rifts in the north, and the Luangwa <b>Valley</b> <b>rift</b> in the east and south-east are just within the province. In places the <b>rift</b> <b>valleys</b> have pushed up highlands: around Kambole and Mbala above Lake Tanganyika, (the Muchinga escarpment above the Luangwa valley, and the highlands along north-eastern border with Tanzania and Malawi which culminate in the Mafinga Hills and Nyika Plateau. These are now in Muchinga Province) These features produce a diverse landscape that varies and poses different challenges, particularly to highway construction, as one moves from one part to another. The Mafinga Hills, which include the highest point in the country at 2301 metres above sea level, once formed a formidable barrier between the Northern and Eastern Provinces that few but the best 4-wheel drive vehicles dared to cross, especially during the rainy season. The shortest road link between the two provinces is now eased by the rehabilitation of the Isoka-Muyombe Road, which traverses their lower slopes.|$|R
5|$|The Metacomet Ridge is {{the result}} of {{continental}} rifting processes that took place 200 million years ago during the Triassic and Jurassic periods. The basalt (also called traprock) crest of the Metacomet Ridge {{is the product of a}} series of massive lava flows hundreds of feet thick that welled up in faults created by the rifting apart of the North American continent from Eurasia and Africa. Essentially, the area now occupied by the Metacomet Ridge is a prehistoric <b>rift</b> <b>valley</b> which was once a branch of (or a parallel of) the major rift to the east that became the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the MSA are {{characterized}} in most regions by the Acheulian to MSA transition. This transition {{is considered to be}} a gradual process, rather than a singular event wherein hominin technologies advanced rapidly. Although the dates for this transition vary widely, the oldest reliably dated MSA site is Gademotta in Ethiopia at greater than 276 thousand years ago. The Middle Awash valley of Ethiopia and the Central <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley</b> of Kenya constituted a major center for behavioural innovation. It is likely that the large terrestrial mammal biomass of these regions supported substantial human populations with subsistence and manufacturing patterns similar to those of ethnographically known foragers.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from eastern Africa {{extending from the}} <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley</b> from Ethiopia to northern Tanzania represents the largest archaeological evidence of the shift from the Late Acheulian to the Middle Stone Age tool technologies. This transition is characterized by stratigraphic layering of Acheulian stone tools, a bifacial handaxe technology, underneath and even contemporaneous with MSA technologies, such as Levallois tools, flakes, flaked tools, pointed flakes, smaller bifaces that are projectile in form, and, on rare occasions, hafted tools. Evidence of the gradual displacement of Acheulian by MSA technologies is further supported by this layering and contemporaneous placement, {{as well as by}} the earliest appearance of MSA technologies at Gademotta and the latest Acheulian technologies at the Bouri Formation of Ethiopia, dated to 154 to 160 kya. This suggests a possible overlap of 100-150 thousand years.|$|E

5|$|Maraba {{coffee is}} {{grown in the}} south of Rwanda at {{coordinates}} , roughly 12kilometres (7mi) from Butare and 150kilometres (93mi) from the capital, Kigali. The project began in the Maraba District of Butare Province, but these entities were replaced under local government organisation in 2006, and the area is now part of Huye District in the Southern Province. The area is very hilly, due to its proximity to the Western <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley</b> and the montane Nyungwe Forest, and features rich volcanic soils. The coffee is grown at altitudes between 1,700 and 2,100 metres (5,577–6,889ft) above sea level, often on steep hillsides with terrace farming. The area experiences an average of 115centimetres (45in) of rainfall annually. The majority of this falls during the rainy season of March to May, the major coffee harvesting season. The high altitude lowers the temperature slightly to an average of about 20 °C (68 °F). There is little seasonal variation.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundaries}} of Palestine have varied throughout history. The Jordan <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley</b> (comprising Wadi Arabah, the Dead Sea and River Jordan) has at times formed {{a political and}} administrative frontier, even within empires that have controlled both territories. At other times, such as during certain periods during the Hasmonean and Crusader states for example, as well as during the biblical period, territories {{on both sides of}} the river formed part of the same administrative unit. During the Arab Caliphate period, parts of southern Lebanon and the northern highland areas of Palestine and Jordan were administered as Jund al-Urdun, while the southern parts of the latter two formed part of Jund Dimashq, which during the 9th century was attached to the administrative unit of Jund Filastin.|$|E
5|$|The {{chestnut}} sparrow {{is found}} in East Africa in mostly lower country from Darfur through Kordofan, South Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya to north-central Tanzania. Its range also extends northeast into the southwest and Great <b>Rift</b> <b>Valley</b> of Ethiopia. Like the golden sparrows, it is sometimes nomadic when not breeding. Vagrants have been recorded as far from their breeding range as Dar es Salaam. It is found mostly in dry savanna and in fields and villages, but unlike its relations the golden sparrows, it is sometimes found in swamps of papyrus (certain Cyperus spp.). Its population has not been quantified, but {{it appears to be}} common across a very large range and it is assessed by the IUCN Red List as Least Concern for global extinction.|$|E
