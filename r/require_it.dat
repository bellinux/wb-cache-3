5|$|Albatrosses, {{along with}} all Procellariiformes, must excrete the salts they ingest in {{drinking}} sea water and eating marine invertebrates. All birds have an enlarged nasal gland {{at the base of}} the bill, above their eyes. This gland is inactive in species that do not <b>require</b> <b>it,</b> but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland. Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes, but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5% saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld. The weld area and electrode is protected from oxidation or other atmospheric contamination by an inert shielding gas (argon or helium), and a filler metal is normally used, though some welds, known as autogenous welds, do not <b>require</b> <b>it.</b> A constant-current welding power supply produces electrical energy, which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E
5|$|Although French is an {{official}} language {{for the purposes}} of the legislature, legislation, and the courts, the Manitoba Act does not <b>require</b> <b>it</b> to be {{an official}} language for the purpose of the executive branch (except when performing legislative or judicial functions). Hence, Manitoba's government is not completely bilingual. The Manitoba French Language Services Policy of 1999 is intended to provide a comparable level of provincial government services in both official languages. According to the 2006 Census, 82.8 percent of Manitoba's population spoke only English, 3.2 percent spoke only French, 15.1 percent spoke both, and 0.9 percent spoke neither.|$|E

Secondly, for an {{indefinite}} period – I {{do not know how}} long – I should have, I would have English as an associate, additional language which can be used not because of facilities and all that... but because I do not wish the people of Non-Hindi areas to feel that certain doors of advance are closed to them because they are forced to correspond – the Government, I mean – in the Hindi language. They can correspond in English. So I could have it as an alternate language as long as people <b>require</b> <b>it</b> and the decision for that – I would leave not to the Hindi-knowing people, but to the non-Hindi-knowing people.|$|E
