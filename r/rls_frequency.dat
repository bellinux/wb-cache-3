40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to explore restless legs {{syndrome}} (<b>RLS)</b> <b>frequency</b> in multiple sclerosis (MS) -patients and establish whether RLS could be a symptom of MS. Over a period of 1 year, we consecutively enrolled 202 MS-patients and 212 healthy controls, matched for sex and age, in a case-control study. All of them filled in a structured questionnaire according to IRLSSG criteria. Those patients who fit the diagnostic criteria were subsequently examined by a neurologist to verify the effective presence of RLS. A total of 91 MS-patients (45 %) responded positively to the questionnaires. The diagnosis of RLS was carried out in 29 subjects (14. 4 %). Among the healthy controls, a definite diagnosis of RLS was achieved only in 6 subjects (2. 8 %). The risk of MS patients to present RLS was significantly higher (OR. 5. 76 P: 0. 00002) than the general population. None of them was affected by other medical conditions related to RLS developing. The 62 remaining patients presented numbness and weakness of the legs not suggestive of RLS. Our findings confirm a significant correlation between MS and RLS. In our opinion, MS must be definitively included among RLS causes...|$|E

We investigated {{the effects of}} night break (NB) treatments on tomato plants using red light (RL) with an intensity of 20 µmol•m 2 •s- 1. Tomato plants were subjected to NB treatments with different frequencies ranging from every 1, 2, 3, and 4 h, and plant growth, flowering, and yield were monitored. The results showed that {{with the increase of}} <b>RL</b> NB <b>frequency,</b> plant height decreased, stem diameter increased, and flower initiation delayed, the content of indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellin 3 (GA 3) in the leaf and stem declined. When the <b>RL</b> NB <b>frequency</b> was every 1 h, the heights of tomato plant decreased by 32. 73 % compared with the control, the diameter of tomato plants increased by 27. 09 % compared with the control, the number of leaves produced before flowering increased to 11, compared with 8 in the control, the contents of IAA and GA 3 in the leaf decreased by 33. 3 % and 41. 29 % respectively compared with the control, the contents of IAA and GA 3 in the stem decreased by 56. 04 % and 57. 14 % respectively compared with the control. After RL NB treatments, tomato plants were transplanted into a solar greenhouse to evaluate tomato yield.

40|$|International audienceSeeding {{light from}} a laser into the cavity of a second one is a simple {{experiment}} largely encountered in optical domain (Stover, H. L., Steier, W. H. : Appl. Phys. Lett. 8, 91 – 93 (1966); Lang, R. : IEEE J. Quant. Elect. 18 (6), 976 – 983 (1982)). With an unidirectional coupling, optical injection is a basic tool to study synchronization process between oscillators. The dynamics induced in this experiment have been extensively described, theoretically and experimentally (Simpson, T. B. et al. : Quant. Semiclassical Opt. 9 (5), 765 – 784 (1997); Wieczorek S. : Opt. Commun. 172, 279 – 295 (1999); Blin, S. : Comptes Rendus de la Phys. 4 (6), 687 – 699 (2003)) but mainly when the seeded light is a continuous wave (CW). In this paper, we describe the synchronization on an undamped relaxation regime. In order to study the degree of correlation between the two synchronized lasers (TL and RL), we use a cascade of two optical injections (Guignard, C. : Conference on Lasers and Electro Optics—the Europeen Quant. Electronics Conference (CLEO-EQEC), Munich (Germany), EC 1 M (2003)) thus three lasers: Master-transmitter laser (TL) -receiver laser (RL). The seeding by a field showing undamped relaxations can be directly compared with the optical injection by a CW signal, especially when the injected power and the detuning between the TL and <b>RL</b> <b>frequencies</b> are varied. Synchronization on undamped relaxation are shown to occur at values of the optical injected power and detuning, for which the RL is in the locked or wave-mixing regime when it is seeded by a CW. However, additional tongues of synchronization also exist at detuning equal to the relaxation oscillation frequency (ROF) ...|$|R

The Ni architectures, with {{lengths of}} about 20 &# 956;m and widths of 4 - 6 &# 956;m, were assembled from tens of Ni nanorods with the averaged diameter of about 200 nm. The Ni nanorods were coated by oxide shells. The saturation magnetization of the Ni architectures {{was found to}} be 66. 2 emu/g. The magnetic loss in the Ni architectures was mainly caused by the natural resonance, while the dielectric relaxation loss was originated from the interfacial relaxation between the oxide shells and the Ni nanorods in addition to the size distribution and morphology of the Ni architectures. Absorbers with a thickness of 2. 1 mm exhibited an optimal reflection loss (RL) value of - 38. 9 dB at 12. 8 GHz. RL values exceeding - 20 dB in the 8. 0 - 17. 8 GHz range were obtained by choosing absorber thicknesses between 1. 5 and 3. 2 mm.

Two hundred and seventy-seven consecutive migraineurs (ICHD-II, 2004) were enrolled and compared with 200 controls; migraine was episodic in 175 and chronic in 102 patients. RLS (IRLSSG criteria, 2003) was present in 22. 7 % of the total sample of migraineurs and in 7. 5 % of the controls (p< 0. 0001). RLS occurred significantly more frequently in chronic compared with episodic migraineurs (34. 3 % vs 16 %, respectively, p= 0. 0006); a significant association between RLS diagnosis and moderate-severe migraine-related disability was also documented (p= 0. 0003). In conclusion, {{the results of the present}} study not only confirm the higher occurrence of RLS in migraine patients compared with the general population, but also suggest that RLS (the condition itself, or the disruption of sleep patterns often found in patients affected by RLS) might affect migraine clinical presentation, being associated with chronic and highly disabling migraine.

40|$|Objective: The lack of nocturnal {{decline in}} blood {{pressure}} (BP) is associated {{with an increase in}} cardiovascular events. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is an uncomfortable feeling which wants for budge the legs with ache of the legs. RLS also increases the hypertension and cardiovascular risk. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between dipping and non-dipping blood pressure pattern with RLS and its severity. Methods: Two hundred patients which had 24 -hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) were enrolled to this cross-sectional study. They were classified by blood pressure pattern as dipping and non-dipping. Then 100 patients with dipper pattern and 100 patients with nondip-per pattern were chosen. A questionnaire for RLS diagnosis which was prepaired by International RLS Study Group, were performed to the patients. Results: RLS Symptom score was higher in patients with non-dipping blood pressure patern (NDBPP) and patients with NDBPP had more severe RLS. Beside this, there were not any differences in terms of <b>RLS</b> <b>frequency</b> in dipping and non-dipping blood pressure patern. Conclusion: As a conclusion, dipping and non-dipping blood pressure patern don’t increase RLS risk. But if the patients with NDBPP have RLS, they have more severe RLS. So, we suggest that, evaluating a patient with non-dipping blood pressure patern, considering RLS would be help-ful for the patient to ameliorate {{the quality of life of}} the patient.

The NiFe 2 O 4 sample exhibits the sheet-like structure, with width varying from 200 to 800 nm and thickness ranging from 20 to 60 nm. The electromagnetic properties of NiFe 2 O 4 nanosheets-paraffin composites have been deeply investigated. The multiple dielectric relaxation loss in NiFe 2 O 4 nanosheets is attributed to the size distribution and morphology of the NiFe 2 O 4 nanosheets. The magnetic loss in the present system is caused mainly by the natural resonance. An absorber with a thickness of 4. 3 mm exhibits an optimal reflection loss (RL) value of - 47. 1 dB at 7. 67 GHz.

40|$|In wheat- 5 RL monotelosomic and ditelosomic {{addition}} lines, a proximal constriction {{located on}} the long arm of rye chromosome 5 R shows neocentric activity at metaphase I of meiosis. In some pollen mother cells this region is unusually stretched, acquires kinetic activity and co-orients with the true centromeres. In the work described here we characterized the putative neocentric constriction of 5 RL using various approaches. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that the rye subtelomeric repetitive DNA sequence pSc 119. 2 is a constituent of the 5 RL constriction. This FISH site corresponds with a heterochromatic C-band in normal rye. Other subtelomeric (pSc 34, pSc 74, pSc 200), centromeric (CCS 1, Bilby) and Arabidopsis-type telomeric sequences produce no detectable hybridization signal on the constriction. Immunolocalization with anti-!-tubulin antibodies showed that microtubules are bound to the constriction {{in a similar way}} to their binding to true centromeres. Silver staining demonstrated that proteins are accumulated at the constriction, the signal being more prominent than that observed at the centromere and telomeres of 5 <b>RL.</b> The <b>frequency</b> of neocentric activity in different plants varied dramatically in different generations and in siblings grown in different years, suggesting that activation of the neocentric site is dependent on internal features and environmental conditions.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{to apply a}} novel space vector pulse width modulation control for three phase Z-source inverter. The space vector modulation for the conventional voltage source inverter is modified so that the additional shoot-through states are inserted within the zero states. So zero voltage time period is diminished for generating a shoot-through time, and active states are unchanged. The shoot-through states are evenly distributed to each phase within zero state. The shoot-through time is used for controlling the dc link voltage boost and hence the output voltage boost of the inverter. This new method provides a high voltage gain at higher modulation index. The proposed algorithm is verified with simulation and experiment. MatLab/Simulink is used for simulating the complete circuit with <b>RL</b> load.

Within this filler concentration the permeability of composites changed continuously with the change of ferrite filler content ratio between two types of ferrite fillers. The observed relaxation type of permeability dispersion {{was due to the}} domain wall and natural ferromagnetic resonance phenomena and was also attributed to the high damping of spin motion. Measured values of permeability were used to determine the EM-wave absorption properties (return loss <b>RL,</b> matching <b>frequency</b> fm, matching thickness dm and bandwidth Df for RL £ - 20 dB). The calculation of these properties was based on a model of single-layered absorber backed by a perfect conductor using transmission-line and EM-field theory.

In this paper, a novel framework for underground beamforming using adaptive antenna arrays is presented to extend communication distances for practical applications. Based on the analysis of propagation in wireless underground channel, a theoretical model is developed which uses soil moisture information to improve wireless underground communications performance. Array element in soil is analyzed empirically and impacts of soil type and soil moisture on return loss (<b>RL)</b> and resonant <b>frequency</b> are investigated. Accordingly, beam patterns are analyzed to communicate with underground and above ground devices. Depending on the incident angle, refraction from soil-air interface has adverse effects in the UG communications. It is shown that beam steering improves UG communications by providing a high-gain lateral wave. To this end, the angle, which enhances lateral wave, is {{shown to be a}} function of dielectric properties of the soil, soil moisture, and soil texture. Evaluations show that this critical angle varies from 0 to 16 and decreases with soil moisture. Accordingly, a soil moisture adaptive beamforming (SMABF) algorithm is developed for planar array structures and evaluated with different optimization approaches to improve UG communication performance...|$|R

We carefully select galaxies from SDSS, FIRST, and NVSS catalogs. We confirm previous findings that the fraction of RL AGNs depends on the black-hole (BH) masses, and on the Eddington ratio. The comparison {{of the nature of}} the hosts of RL and RQ AGNs, therefore, requires pair-matching techniques. Matching in BH mass and Eddington ratio allows us to study the differences between galaxies hosting RL and RQ AGNs that have the same basic accretion parameters. We show that these two samples differ predominantly in the host-galaxy concentration index, morphological type (in the <b>RL</b> sample the <b>frequency</b> of elliptical galaxies becoming larger with increasing radio loudness), and nebular extinction (galaxies with highest radio loudness showing only low nebular extinction).

40|$|The {{frequency}} dependence of pulmonary compliance and resistance {{was investigated in}} 27 patients with obstructive lung disease. Compliance and resistance were determined either by the conventional zero crossing (Cdyn) and isovolume (RL) technique or by a modified Fourier analysis following a smoothing procedure (auto- and cross-correlation function) yielding an effective compliance and resistance, CL and RL. The latter technique was used to calculate CL and RL from the fundamental and third and fourth harmonics present in the flow and transpulmonary pressure signals. Three breathing frequencies were investigated: 0. 5, 1, and 2 Hz. Both Cdyn and CL, calculated from the fundamental component, decreased progressively with frequency. However, Cdyn showed less {{frequency dependence}} than CL. CL calculated from the harmonics was significantly smaller than CL from the fundamental at the same breathing <b>frequency.</b> <b>RL,</b> as well as RL calculated from the fundamental, tended to increase with frequency. A decline of resistance with frequency became apparent, however, when RL from the fundamental was compared with RL obtained from the corresponding higher order harmonics.

Instead the measurements should be performed at a single frequency, for instance spontaneous breathing, by computing resistance from the higher order harmonics present in the breathing signals. status: publishe...|$|R

Seven parameters were intercompared to assess their sensitivity in detecting mines: bottom type, SSP, water depth/sonar depth, mine depth, frequency, sonars and models. Performance was assessed using several measures of effectiveness including the signal to noise ratio and initial detection range. Variations in these measures were analyzed by investigating how TL and RL responded to changing parameters. No one single parameter was identified that affected sonar performance significantly above all others. Of the environmental parameters considered, variations in bottom type exerted the most influence on TL and RL and ultimately on sonar performance. IL was clearly a significant factor when the bottom type is comprised of absorptive, fine- grained material. Of the sonar parameters, frequency exerted a significant impact on performance with TL the most sensitive term in this comparison.

Process maps for case-level barcode tagging, item-level RFID tagging, case-level RFID tagging and pallet-level RFID tagging in EOL aircraft RL were developed and simulated in Arena simulation software in order to comparatively analyze the Return-On-Investment (ROI) of the different RFID technology levels. The results of our research, focusing on passive RFID technology, demonstrate that use of RFID technology in EOL aircraft RL network offers great potential compared to barcode system; however, the high initial investment cost of RFID technology deployment may necessitate proper planning, such as business process re-engineering (BPR), tag reuse and phased implementation, to achieve more positive ROI. ...|$|R
