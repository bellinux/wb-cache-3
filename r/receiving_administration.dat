40|$|Rosiglitazone (RGZ), an oral anti-hyperglycemic agent {{used for}} non-insulin-dependent {{diabetes}} mellitus, is a high-affinity synthetic agonist for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). Both in vitro and in vivo experiments have {{also revealed that}} RGZ possesses anti-inflammatory properties. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of RGZ in a rat model of periodontal disease induced by ligature placed around the mandible first molars of each animal. Male Wister rats were divided into four groups: 1) animals without ligature placement <b>receiving</b> <b>administration</b> of empty vehicle (control); 2) animals with ligature <b>receiving</b> <b>administration</b> of empty vehicle; 3) animals with ligature <b>receiving</b> <b>administration</b> with oral RGZ (10 mg/kg/day); and 4) animals with ligature <b>receiving</b> <b>administration</b> of subcutaneous RGZ (10 mg/kg/day). Thirty days after induction of periodontal disease, the animals were sacrificed, and mandibles and gingival tissues were removed for further analysis. An in vitro assay was also employed to test the inhibitory effects of RGZ on osteoclastogenesis. Histomorphological and immunohistochemical analyses of periodontal tissue demonstrated that RGZ-treated animals presented decreased bone resorption, along with reduced RANKL expression, compared to those animals with ligature, but treated with empty vehicle. Corresponding to such results obtained from in vivo experiments, RGZ also suppressed in vitro osteoclast differentiation {{in the presence of}} RANKL in MOCP- 5 osteoclast precursor cells, along with the down-regulation of the expression of RANKL-induced TRAP mRNA. These data indicated that RGZ may suppress the bone resorption by inhibiting RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis elicited during the course of experimental periodontitis in rats. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.

40|$|Therapeutic {{treatment}} for {{inflammatory bowel disease}} (IBD) may follow different approaches, systemic as well as local, especially when the target is the osteoarticular apparatus. Although some clinical trials have suggested benefits from probiotics administration in IBD, {{there is still a}} great deal of controversy on their use. the aim {{of this study was to}} further investigate the effects of probiotics in patients with IBD and related spondyloarthropathy. Fifty-nine patients affected by IBD with extra-intestinal involvement where evaluated from 2006 to 2010. Twenty-eight patients <b>received</b> <b>administration</b> of a standard therapy with mesalazine and 31 where treated with the same therapy plus probiotic supplement.

40|$|SUMMARY] 118 {{patients}} with nerve root pain （lumbar pain and lower limb pain） of lumbar disc herniation （LDH） who visited our Hospital, were randomly {{divided into two}} groups and selective nerve root block（SNRB） was performed: Group S（＋）: <b>Received</b> concomitant <b>administration</b> of steroids with local anesthetic at the time of nerve root block; Group S（－）: <b>Received</b> <b>administration</b> of local anesthetic alone at the time of nerve root block. Subsequently, Visual Analog Scale and Present Pain Intensity scores obtained before SNRB, 1 day, 1 hour and 1 week after SNRB were compared between the two groups. There were no statistically significant differences in Visual Analog Scale and Present Pain Intensity scores obtained before SNRB, 1 hour and 1 week after SNRB between the Group S（＋） and Group S（－）. But there were statistical significant differences in Visual Analog Scale and Present Pain Intensity scores obtained 1 day after SNRB between the Group S（＋） and Group S（－）.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the potential antidepressive-like effect of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), one of available blood-activating and stasis-eliminating components from traditional Chinese medicines, in chronic mild stress (CMS) -induced rat model of depression. Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) strain rats were divided into six matched groups (n = 13 or 14 in each group) based on their sucrose consumption: control, CMS, CMS + fluoxetine (FLU), and CMS + TMP groups. The rats except control were housed separately in different rooms, and the rat model of depression was established by exposing to an unpredictable sequence of stressors for 28 days; the rats in CMS + FLU were exposed to CMS and <b>received</b> <b>administration</b> of FLU (2. 0 mg/kg/d, ig) for 28 days; the rats in CMS + TMP groups were exposed to CMS and <b>received</b> <b>administration</b> of TMP (10, 20, 40 mg/kg/d, ig), respectively, for 28 days. The rats in control group were given ordinary daily care, and the rats in control and CMS groups <b>received</b> ig <b>administration</b> of normal saline instead of FLU or TMP. The body weight, food intake and fluid consumption were measured, and the behaviors were examined by open field test before and after CMS, and forced-swimming test was performed 1 day after last unpredictable stressor. Chronic administration of TMP partially reversed the effects of CMS on consumption of sucrose solution and locomotion and exploration behavior, and potently shortened the immobility time during forced-swimming test following CMS in rats. The results showed that long-term administration of TMP partially reversed the effects of CMS on the body weight gain, the consumption of sucrose solution, the squares crossin gand rearing in open field test, and the immobility time during forced-swimming test in rats. The present data provide evidences that TMP possesses obvious antidepressant-like activity in CMS-induced rat model of depression...|$|R
