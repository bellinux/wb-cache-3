The cast of the production at the Los Angeles Biltmore Theater also included Cora Witherspoon and <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny.</b>|$|E
25|$|At 6:46 pm, <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny,</b> a white {{truck driver}} who {{stopped at a}} traffic light at the {{intersection}} of Florence and Normandie, was dragged from his semi-trailer truck and severely beaten by a mob of local black residents.

But he then lost almost all of his money speculating in oil and mining stocks.|$|E

25|$|Denny and Whittier {{went looking}} for bankers to provide bridge financing, and one of these put them in touch with Whitney Collins, a {{vice-president}} at Menasco Motors Company and budding entrepreneur. Collins and Denny estimated it would take somewhere between $50,000 and $75,000 to bring the RP-3 up to the performance demanded by the original $11,000 contract, but Collins {{was willing to take}} a chance that this would lead to future business. Collins and his partner Harold Powell split the drone program off from <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny</b> Hobby Shops and formed Radioplane with Denny and Whittier. Whittier was later bought out.|$|E
25|$|Two complete, original, Sopwith Snipes survive. E6938 {{resides in}} the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Rockcliffe on the {{outskirts}} of Ottawa. Formerly owned by film star <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny,</b> it had been restored by Jack Canary, in California, in the 1960s. E8105 is exhibited at the National Air And Space Museum in Washington, D.C. Previously, it {{had been one of the}} most cherished aircraft at the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome, in Rhinebeck, New York. It passed to the NASM after Cole Palen's death in December 1993. The fuselage (minus landing gear, engine and cowl) of Major William G. Barker's Snipe, E8102, resides at the Canadian War Museum, Ottawa.|$|E
25|$|Denny then {{approached}} (or {{was approached}} by) Nelson Paul Whittier, grandson of famous California Quaker pioneer, John Greenleaf Whittier. The two formed <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny</b> Industries in 1935 {{to develop a}} new radio controlled model, and were joined by electronics engineer Kenneth Case. For the next three years they attempted to produce a design known as the Radioplane One, or RP-1, essentially a greatly enlarged model airplane, complete with a fuselage area that included the step where a windscreen was in a real aircraft. The control system was based on a telephone dial: dial 4 for elevator down, and then 2 to stop the motion. Due to the latencies in the system, the aircraft were found to be almost uncontrollable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reginald</b> Oliver <b>Denny</b> (born January 22, 1956), was a 36 {{year old}} {{construction}} dump truck driver. On {{the first day}} of the rioting, Denny was attacked by several men, pulled from his International Road Tractor and brutally beaten, sustaining serious head trauma and other injuries. Denny's ability to speak and drive were affected by the attack, and he had to undergo years of rehabilitative therapy. During his recovery, he received over 27,000 get-well cards from supportive members of the community.|$|R
50|$|Born in Richmond, Surrey, England, Denny (sources {{differ on}} his birth name giving {{variously}} Reginald Daymore, Reginald Leigh Daymore and <b>Reginald</b> Leigh Dugmore <b>Denny,</b> {{but he is}} listed in birth records as Reginald Leigh Dugmore) began his stage career at age seven in The Royal Family. At age 16, he appeared in The Merry Widow. That year he left the Jesuit school {{which he had been}} attending, St Francis Xavier College, Mayfield, East Sussex.|$|R
50|$|Becker {{began his}} career in {{broadcasting}} in 1975 as a reporter at WFRV-TV in Green Bay, Wisconsin, before moving in 1977 to WTHR-TV in Indianapolis as a weekend anchor and field reporter. He then moved to KCBS-TV in Los Angeles in 1980 as a reporter, eventually becoming head of the Investigative Team and weekend anchor, as well as host of a short-lived 7 p.m. newscast. He received three Emmys for coverage of the Cerritos plane crash, and Southern California windstorms. He also received six Golden Mike Awards and the AP Mark Twain Award for news writing. During his tenure at KCBS, he also served two years as President of the Radio/TV News Association of Southern California. In 1990, Becker moved on to KCOP-TV to anchor the station's only newscast, replacing Warren Olney. At KCOP he received an Emmy Award for coverage of the <b>Reginald</b> Oliver <b>Denny</b> beating which started the L.A area riots.|$|R
25|$|At 6:43 pm, {{truck driver}} Larry Tarvin, driving down Florence, {{stopped at a}} red light at Normandie in a large white {{delivery}} truck. He was pulled from the truck by a group of men including Henry Watson, who proceeded to kick and beat him, before striking him unconscious with a fire extinguisher taken from his own vehicle. He lay unconscious for more than a minute as his truck was looted, before staggering back to his vehicle. With the help of an unknown African American named Rodney, Tarvin was able to drive his truck out of further harm's way. Just before he did so, another truck, driven by <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny,</b> entered the intersection.|$|E
25|$|Justifications for harsher punishments for {{hate crimes}} {{focus on the}} notion that hate crimes cause greater {{individual}} and societal harm. It is said that, when the core of a person’s identity is attacked, the degradation and dehumanization is especially severe, and additional emotional and physiological problems are likely to result. Society then, in turn, can suffer from the disempowerment of a group of people. Furthermore, it is asserted that the chances for retaliatory crimes are greater when a hate crime has been committed. The riots in Los Angeles, California that followed the beating of Rodney King, a Black motorist, by a group of White police officers are cited as support for this argument. The beating of white truck driver <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny</b> by black rioters during the same riot is also an example that supports this argument.|$|E
25|$|The World War I desert drama The Lost Patrol (1934), {{based on}} the book Patrol by Philip MacDonald, was a {{superior}} remake of the 1929 silent film Lost Patrol. It starred Victor McLaglen as The Sergeant—the role played by his brother Cyril McLaglen in the earlier version—with Boris Karloff, Wallace Ford, Alan Hale and <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny</b> (who went on to found a company that made radio-controlled target aircraft during World War II). It was one of Ford's first big hits of the sound era—it was rated by both the National Board of Review and The New York Times as one of the Top 10 films of that year and won an Oscar nomination for its stirring Max Steiner score. It was followed later that year by The World Moves On with Madeleine Carroll and Franchot Tone, and the highly successful Judge Priest, his second film with Will Rogers, which became one of the top-grossing films of the year.|$|E
50|$|Years {{later he}} joined an opera {{company as a}} baritone, and toured India. After {{continuing}} his stage career in America, his film career started in 1915 with the old World Film Company and he made films both in the United States and Britain until the 1960s. He came from a theatrical family which went to the United States in 1912 {{to appear in the}} stage production Quaker Girl. His father was the actor and singer W.H. <b>Denny.</b> <b>Reginald</b> appeared in John Barrymore's 1920 Broadway production of Richard III; the two actors became friends. Denny was a well-known actor in silent films and with the advent of talkies, he became a character actor. He played the lead role in a number of his earlier films, generally as a comedic Englishman in such works as Private Lives and later had reasonably steady work as a supporting actor in dozens of films, including The Little Minister (1934) with Katharine Hepburn, Anna Karenina (1935) with Greta Garbo, Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940) and the Frank Sinatra crime caper film Assault on a Queen (1966). His last role was in Batman (1966) as Commodore Schmidlapp. He made frequent appearances in television during the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R

2500|$|Viguié {{then went}} to work as a {{cameraman}} for [...] "Porto Rico Photoplays," [...] a film company established in Hato Rey.

Amongst the main staff of the company were <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny,</b> Ralph Ince and Ruth Clifford, who were involved in constant quarrels.|$|E
2500|$|Brown's {{career in}} films began around 1925 as a laborer on the Universal. By 1926 he had inched {{his way into}} the studio as a gagman for <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny.</b> In 1927, he got his first break as a writer, when Universal bought a one-act play from him that was never produced, but led to his first screen credits for work on [...] a 1929 cowboy movie {{starring}} Hoot Gibson.|$|E
2500|$|Stephens knew barnstormers and World War I flying aces, {{pioneers of}} early aviation.

2500|$|Around 7:40 pm, {{almost an}} hour after <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny</b> was rescued at Florence and Normandie, another beating was {{captured}} on videotape in that location. Fidel Lopez, a self-employed construction worker and Guatemalan immigrant, was pulled from his GMC pickup truck and robbed of nearly $2,000. Members of the rioters including Damian Williams smashed his forehead open with a car stereo as another rioter attempted to slice his ear off. After Lopez lost consciousness, the crowd spray-painted his chest, torso, and genitals black. He was eventually rescued by Rev. Bennie Newton, who told the rioters: [...] "Kill him, {{and you have to}} kill me too." [...] Lopez survived the attack, but it took him years to fully recover and re-establish his business. Newton and Lopez became close friends until the death of the former in 1993.|$|E
2500|$|In {{hopes of}} {{producing}} her own films, MacDonald went to United Artists to make The Lottery Bride (1930). Despite music by Rudolf Friml, {{the film was}} not successful. MacDonald next signed a three-picture deal with the Fox Film Corporation. Oh, for a Man! (1930) was more successful; MacDonald portrayed a temperamental opera singer who sings Wagner's [...] "Liebestod" [...] and falls for an Irish burglar played by <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny.</b> Don't Bet on Women (1931) was a nonmusical drawing-room comedy in which playboy Edmund Lowe bets his happily married friend Roland Young that he can seduce Young's wife (MacDonald). Annabelle's Affairs (1931) was a farce with MacDonald as a sophisticated New York playgirl who does not recognize her own miner husband, played by Victor MacLaglen, when he turns up 5 years later. Highly praised by reviewers at the time, only one reel of this film survives.|$|E
2500|$|Horman {{was born}} on September 2, 1905 in Chicago Illinois. His first foray into the film {{industry}} was providing the story for 1934's The Meanest Gal in Town, starring ZaSu Pitts and directed by Russell Mack. After the success of that film, RKO signed him to a contract, and assigned him to work with Wanda Tuchock on Grand Old Girl (1935); By 1936 he had left RKO and was signed by the Poverty Row studio, Chesterfield-Invincible. While at C-I he did such films as the 1936 crime drama The Crime Patrol, for which he wrote the story, and It Couldn't Have Happened – But It Did, a 1936 comedy-drama directed by Phil Rosen and starring <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny,</b> for which Horman wrote both the story and the screenplay. When Maury M. Cohen closed down Invincible and {{signed an agreement with}} RKO, Horman followed him back to his old studio. Other [...] "B"-films on which Horman worked during this period include the story and screenplay for the crime-drama Double Danger (1938), directed by Lew Landers, the screenplay for another crime-drama, My Son Is a Criminal, directed by Charles C. Coleman, which Horman received positive notices for the plot, and the story and screenplay for another Coleman film, When G-Men Step In (1938). While working at Columbia, Horman would write the screenplay for one of their Lone Wolf series, The Lone Wolf in Paris, which was the only film in the series which stars Francis Lederer in the title role.|$|E
2500|$|Twitter {{suspended}} Reynolds' account, but restored it {{shortly after}} {{and told him}} to delete the tweet in order to be allowed to use Twitter again. The University of Tennessee released a statement that it was investigating Reynolds as it does not condone language that encourages violence. [...] On September 27, 2016, the law school's Dean Melanie Wilson issued a statement to announce that the University had ended its short-lived investigation with a recommendation that no disciplinary action be taken. [...] Dean Wilson wrote that Reynolds' tweet [...] "...was an exercise of his First Amendment rights. Nevertheless, the tweet offended many members of our community and beyond, and I understand the hurt and frustration they feel." [...] USA Today said that Reynolds had violated the newspaper’s standards and suspended his column for one month. Reynolds issued an apology at the request of USA Today saying:Wednesday night one of my 580,000 tweets blew up. I didn’t live up to my own standards, and I didn’t meet USA TODAY’s standards. For that I apologize, to USA TODAY readers and to my followers on social media. ... Those words can easily be taken to advocate drivers going {{out of their way to}} run down protesters. I meant no such thing, and I'm sorry it seemed I did. What I meant is that drivers who feel their lives are in danger from a violent mob should not stop their vehicles. I remember <b>Reginald</b> <b>Denny,</b> a truck driver who was beaten nearly to death by a mob during the 1992 Los Angeles riots.|$|E
