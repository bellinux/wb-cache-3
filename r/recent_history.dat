5|$|The {{emergence}} of a woman writing {{in the press and}} composing poetry in this dark era was a significant event.

5|$|According to a 2005 review, due to {{the high}} levels of {{mortality}} and morbidity caused by malaria—especially the P.falciparum species—it has placed the greatest selective pressure on the human genome in <b>recent</b> <b>history.</b> Several genetic factors provide some resistance to it including sickle cell trait, thalassaemia traits, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and the absence of Duffy antigens on red blood cells.|$|E

5|$|Government in Ratanakiri is weak, {{largely due}} to the province's remoteness, ethnic diversity, and <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> of Khmer Rouge dominance. The provincial legal {{framework}} is poor, {{and the rule of law}} is even weaker in Ratanakiri than elsewhere in Cambodia. Furthermore, government services are ineffective and insufficient to meet the needs of the province. The Cambodian government has traditionally accepted substantial support from NGOs in the region.|$|E
5|$|L. decemlineata is {{an iconic}} species {{and has been}} used as an image on stamps because of its {{association}} with the <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> of both North America and Europe.

5|$|Szabó is {{the most}} internationally famous Hungarian filmmaker since the late 1960s.

5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle {{does not}} say who was the aggressor at Ellandun, but one <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> asserts that Beornwulf was almost {{certainly}} the one who attacked. According to this view, Beornwulf may {{have taken advantage of}} the Wessex campaign in Dumnonia in the summer of 825. Beornwulf's motivation to launch an attack would have been the threat of unrest or instability in the southeast: the dynastic connections with Kent made Wessex a threat to Mercian dominance.|$|E

In 2009, while in civil war, Chad spent 4.2% of GDP on defense, which fell to 1.6% of GDP in 2011 before rising to 2.0% of GDP in 2013, when Chad began its military intervention in Northern Mali, as it worked with France and other African nations to bring back Mali's sovereignty over territory in the North.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{has many}} {{similarities}} with the Picardy Spaniel {{due to the}} two breeds' <b>recent</b> <b>history.</b> The Blue Spaniel is described as being softer, {{as well as the}} obvious difference in coat color.
