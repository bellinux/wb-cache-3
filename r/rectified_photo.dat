40|$|In photogrammetry, georeference is {{a process}} to {{determine}} ground coordinate based on measurement of photo coordinate. In digital photogrammetry, georeference process {{can be carried out}} using many softwares which are widely available. Georeference is important in photogrammetry. There are many techniques of georeference such as rectification and orthorectification. The accuracy of georeference is very critical because it depends on the capability of the software to produce good accuracy. Today there are many software available for digital photogrammetry but each software may use different algorithm. The aim {{of this study is to}} make comparison of accuracy between three softwares ERDAS IMAGINE 2011, ArcGIS 9. 3 and Global Mapper 13 using different georeference techniques. In this study, four aerial photos, acquired from Department of Survey and Mapping Malaysia and 11 GCPs and 21 CPs were established using rapid static technique of Global Positioning System (GPS) and secondary data were used to perform georeference process. Georeference process was performed using the three softwares and these comparison was made based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Also digitizing is carried out from the rectified and orthorectified photos in the three softwares. The distance measurements was also compared with distance measured on the ground. The RMSE based on point measurement, distance measurement and other factors such as time taken for processing was compared for the three softwares. In this study the results showed that orthorectification technique in ERDAS IMAGINE 2011 software produces better accuracy (± 0. 333 m) compared to rectification technique in ArcGIS 9. 3 (± 0. 879 m) and Global Mapper 13 (± 1. 367 m). As conclusion, Global Mapper 13 and ArcGIS 9. 3 can generate <b>rectified</b> <b>photo</b> with reasonable accuracy but both softwares could not produced block triangulation and orthophoto. However, ArcGIS 9. 3 and Global Mapper 13 softwares are much more user friendly compared to ERDAS IMAGINE 2011 software...|$|E
40|$|The {{total number}} of craters within a bin of mean diameter, {{and the number of}} craters of each degradational type within that bin are tabulated. Rim-to-rim diameters were {{measured}} at arbitrary azimuths for <b>rectified</b> <b>photos</b> or photos taken at vertical incidence (most lunar photos), and at azimuths paralleling a local tangent to the limb for oblique images...|$|R
40|$|This article {{proposes a}} novel {{approach}} on how to <b>rectify</b> the <b>photo</b> image of the bound document. The surface of the document is modeled by a cylindrical surface. By the geometry of camera image formation, the equations using the cue of directrixes to map the points on the surface in the 3 -D scene to the points on the image plane are achieved. Baselines of the horizontal text line are extracted as projections of directrixes to estimate the bending extent of the surface, and then the images are rectified. The proposed method needs no auxiliary device. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the feasibility {{and the application of}} the method. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of 3 D models, their realistic photo restitution via synthetic images {{and the development}} of dynamic simulations are the most suited and potentially richest tools for the re{{construction of}} architectural images as well as the planning of urban interventions in historical cities. The case of study concerns the most ancient part of the historical centre of Castellammare del Golfo in Western Sicily, which has been built around a maritime medieval nucleus constituted by an Arab Norman castle. The suburb, which suffered a severe decay during the last decades, have been recently object restored without an unitary plan of conservation. A study of an integrated plan of recovery of the colours of the facades of the suburb and of the urban illumination supported by an European grant is in progress. Within this framework a research based on integrated techniques of computer aided surveying and numerical and digital methodologies {{for the creation of a}} virtual 3 D model has been undertaken. The goal is to reproduce the aggregate of the buildings and the open air spaces with geometric precision and good accuracy of the colours and textures of the constructive materials. The survey has been carried out using an integrated topographic station equipped with a laser diastimeter, while the textures have been surveyed by digital photogrammetry. Several urban shapes obtained via a mosaic of <b>rectified</b> <b>photos</b> form the geometric and visual starting point for the project of the colour plan, which aims to restore the original colours and constitutes a model for all the ancient constructed area. The 3 D model also allows to control the volumes and types of the building in order to develop a recovery plan for the different building units and a new design of the public space. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper evaluates {{advantages}} of application of digital photogrammetry {{for the purposes}} of production of technical documentation for the objects under protection, comparing it with the classical photogrammetric procedures. Based on gained experiences, paper reviews procedures for the completely digital production of technical documentation. Process of making technical documentation is divided in two logical stages. First stage comprises of photogrammetric recording, necessary field measurements and production of archive documentation. Archive documentation is in completely digital form and it includes: geometrically <b>rectified</b> photogrammetric <b>photos,</b> data on control points, parameters of exterior orientation for all photos and digital orthophotos as a preliminary source of geometric information. Second stage involves the production of detailed documentation with data describing object geometry such as: floor plans, facades, sections, etc, by using suitable CAD tools. Considering that this constitutes the most complicated and the most expensive part of making technical documentation, this stage is done when needed. Proposed method will be illustrated in paper by using experiences gained on projects of making technical documentations for objects of historical and cultural heritage for the towns of Kragujevac (Serbia and Montenegro) and Banja Luka (Republic of Srpska) ...|$|R
40|$|The pulse {{function}} (PF) {{is a technique}} based on procedural preprocessing system to generate a computerized virtual photo of the façade with in a fixed size square(Alizadehashrafi et al., 2009, Musliman et al., 2010). Dynamic Pulse Function (DPF) is an enhanced version of PF which can create the final photo, proportional to real geometry. This can avoid distortion while projecting the computerized photo on the generated 3 D model(Alizadehashrafi and Rahman, 2013). The challenging issue that might be handled for having 3 D model in LoD 3 rather than LOD 2, is the final aim that have been achieved in this paper. In the technique based DPF the geometries of the windows and doors are saved in an XML file schema which {{does not have any}} connections with the 3 D model in LoD 2 and CityGML format. In this research the parameters of Dynamic Pulse Functions are utilized via Ruby programming language in SketchUp Trimble to generate (exact position and deepness) the windows and doors automatically in LoD 3 based on the same concept of DPF. The advantage of this technique is automatic generation of huge number of similar geometries e. g. windows by utilizing parameters of DPF along with defining entities and window layers. In case of converting the SKP file to CityGML via FME software or CityGML plugins the 3 D model contains the semantic database about the entities and window layers which can connect the CityGML to MySQL(Alizadehashrafi and Baig, 2014). The concept behind DPF, is to use logical operations to project the texture on the background image which is dynamically proportional to real geometry. The process of projection is based on two vertical and horizontal dynamic pulses starting from upper-left corner of the background wall in down and right directions respectively based on image coordinate system. The logical one/zero on the intersections of two vertical and horizontal dynamic pulses projects/does not project the texture on the background image. It is possible to define priority for each layer. For instance the priority of the door layer can be higher than window layer which means that window texture cannot be projected on the door layer. Orthogonal and <b>rectified</b> perpendicular symmetric <b>photos</b> of the 3 D objects that are proportional to the real façade geometry must be utilized for the generation of the output frame for DPF. The DPF produces very high quality and small data size of output image files in quite smaller dimension compare with the photorealistic texturing method. The disadvantage of DPF is its preprocessing method to generate output image file rather than online processing to generate the texture within the 3 D environment such as CityGML. Furthermore the result of DPF can be utilized for 3 D model in LOD 2 rather than LOD 3. In the current work the random textures of the window layers are created based on parameters of DPF within Ruby console of SketchUp Trimble to generate the deeper geometries of the windows and their exact position on the façade automatically along with random textures to increase Level of Realism (LoR) (Scarpino, 2010). As the output frame in DPF is proportional to real geometry (height and width of the façade) it is possible to query the XML database and convert them to units such as meter automatically. In this technique, the perpendicular terrestrial photo from the façade is rectified by employing projective transformation based on the frame which is in constrain proportion to real geometry. The <b>rectified</b> <b>photos</b> which are not suitable for texturing but necessary for measuring, can be resized in constrain proportion to real geometry before measuring process. Height and width of windows, doors, horizontal and vertical distance between windows from upper left corner of the photo dimensions of doors and windows are parameters that should be measured to run the program as a plugins in SketchUp Trimble. The system can use these parameters and texture file names and file paths to create the façade semi-automatically. To avoid leaning geometry the textures of windows, doors and etc, should be cropped and <b>rectified</b> from perpendicular <b>photos,</b> {{so that they can be}} used in the program to create the whole façade along with its geometries. Texture enhancement should be done in advance such as removing disturbing objects, exposure setting, left-right up-down transformation, and so on. In fact, the quality, small data size, scale and semantic database for each façade are the prominent advantages of this method...|$|R
40|$|Why: In {{order to}} protect {{cultural}} heritage, understood as a right and an obligation of the society; it requires to achieve a deep knowledge of all its heritage values. Not only documenting them for posterity, but mainly to enable a proper management allowing decisions based on accurate, adequate and timely information[1]. Therefore it will facilitate preventive conservation and maintenance practices. Nevertheless there is another social and economic reality in other countries such as Ecuador. This situation obliges to the researchers to be more creative and practical with tools and methods more adjusted to different contexts; without renouncing the protection and conservation of cultural heritage[2]. Where or Context: In general, historical sites and heritage buildings are {{a great source of}} information to know the past, understand the present and project them to the future[3]. The development of a monitoring system based on an aerial photos, had been performed in order to implement preventive conservation strategies in the historic centre of the city of Cuenca; which is starting to undertake permanent evaluations related to the identification of damages or changes (materials, interventions, etc) on its built heritage. When: Nowadays there are different and sophisticated tools to document culture heritage, which are evolving every day[4]. But in order to contribute and apply a practical Monitoring and Control System for Cuenca, this research presents a different approach in documentation of cultural heritage. It aims to be decisive visual information; obtained through successive aerial photography taken from an “ultra-light”. Through this documentation and in comparison with old aerial photography of the city; different analyses could be carried out by integrating this information in a geographic information system (GIS). In doing so, this system could be an important tool for heritage managers involved in process of preventive conservation. Effectiveness: In order to accomplish the analysis process, the integration between the database and the GIS, which is still at its initial stage had been fundamental in the development of this monitoring and control system. The overlaying procedure (between <b>rectified</b> <b>photos</b> from different periods), allows to clearly visualize the current situation at the interior of the building blocks. The analysis was executed in four particular building blocks, taken as example to prove the system. They were evaluated between the periods 1954, 1978, 2008 and 2009; and the results showed different changes in materials, covered courtyards, roofs, etc. These interventions evidence the lost of heritage values, nowadays occurring in Cuenca. Although, this research was successfully applied; it faced different limitations. Such as: occasionally resulted difficult to distinguish diverse materials (tiles, zinc, stone, etc), added or missing elements of a heritage building. The resolution of the pictures was decisive during the analysis process. These so far identified problems could be necessarily taken in further investigations. Finally it is important to remark that this monitoring and control system is a clear example of a cost-effectiveness management tool for a World Heritage Site. Which could be further developed in the city of Cuenca. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to use a Global Positioning System (GPS) to determine the aerial camera location and orientation that best facilitated mapping done from aerial photographs without any ground control. Four test flights were conducted. The first test flight was performed in June 1993 at St. Louis, with the {{objective of}} testing the multiantenna concept using two antenna on the aircraft. The second test in August 1993 was conducted over the Iowa State University (ISU) campus at Ames. This flight evaluated the use of GPS for pinpoint navigation. The third test flight over St. Louis was flown in October 1993, with four antenna on aircraft; its objective was to evaluate the 3 DF GPS receiver and the antenna locations. On the basis of the results of these three tests, a final test flight over the Mustang Project area in Ames and the ISU campus was conducted in June 1994. Analysis of these data showed that airborne GPS can be used (1) in pinpoint navigation with an accuracy of 25 m or better, (2) to determine the location of the camera nodal point with an accuracy of 10 cm or better, and (3) to determine the orientation angles of the camera with an accuracy of 0. 0001 radians or better. In addition, the exterior orientation elements determined by airborne GPS can be used to <b>rectify</b> aerial <b>photos,</b> to produce orthophotos, and in direct stereo plotting. Further research is recommended in these areas to maximize the use of airborne GPS. The report is organized in the following chapters: (1) Introduction; (2) Photogrammetry and Kinematic GPS; (3) Analysis of First Test; (4) Analysis of Second Test; (5) Analysis of Third Test; (6) Analysis of Final Test; (7) Applications of Airborne GPS; and (8) Conclusion and Recommendation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explains}} how ortho-rectification of frame camera, aerial photography is fairly complex, {{and the difficulties}} associated with <b>rectifying</b> oblique aerial <b>photos</b> (OAPs) from small format photography have been so problematic that the approach has been little used and seldom described within the literature. Recent advances in photogrammetric software, however, have now made conventional, frame camera photogrammetry more convenient and more easily {{able to deal with}} the ortho-rectification of space-borne and air-borne sensors as well as hand-held film and digital cameras. Consequently, it is now possible to use oblique photography to correct vertical photographs - provided that we address issues related to image distortion and ensure that the reliability of extracted features is sufficient for their use within Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This will be demonstrated by showing that oblique photographs taken with a hand-held, 35 mm camera during a reconnaissance flight over a weed infested area can be ortho-rectified using modern software, thereby clarifying this approach’s status as a useful aid for delineating infestations for the purpose of say, ground truthing, verification of remotely sensed image analysis or simply contributing towards more comprehensive aerial mapping. The example used here may seem trivial but it actually illustrates, clearly, how a spraying pattern, while possibly too refined to show in a satellite image, can be mapped as a reference for monitoring weed infestations. This example is not intended to be a rigorous application of the technique, but simply a demonstration of its possibilities whenever {{there is a need to}} quickly or frequently update existing spatial data and environmental records in a much more cost-effective way than would be possible through deployment of the much more expensive, conventional, aerial survey methods...|$|R
