500|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet is a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate {{diet that}} in medicine is used primarily to treat difficult-to-control (<b>refractory)</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in children. The diet forces {{the body to}} burn fats rather than carbohydrates. Normally, the carbohydrates contained in food are converted into glucose, which is then transported around the body and is particularly important in fueling brain-function. However, if {{there is very little}} carbohydrate in the diet, the liver converts fat into fatty acids and ketone bodies. The ketone bodies pass into the brain and replace glucose as an energy source. An elevated level of ketone bodies in the blood, a state known as ketosis, leads to a reduction in the frequency of epileptic seizures. Almost half of children, and young people, with epilepsy who have tried some form of this diet saw the number of seizures drop by at least half, and the effect persists even after discontinuing the diet. There is some evidence that adults with epilepsy may benefit from the diet, and that a less strict regimen, such as a modified Atkins diet, is similarly effective. [...] The most common adverse effect is constipation, affecting about 30% of patients—this was due to fluid restriction, which was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E
50|$|Clobazam is {{sometimes}} used for <b>refractory</b> <b>epilepsies.</b> However, long-term prophylactic treatment of epilepsy has considerable drawbacks, most importantly loss of antiepileptic effects due to tolerance which may render long-term therapy ineffective.

Furthermore, benzodiazepines have the drawback, particularly after long-term use, of causing rebound seizures upon abrupt or over-rapid discontinuation of therapy forming part of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome.|$|R

The median duration of treatment with sulthiame was 18 (range 2 – 37) months. Fifty five percent of patients showed at least a 50 % reduction in seizure frequency and two patients were seizure-free at the end of follow-up. Patients with focal seizures responded best. Seven patients reported side effects, leading to withdrawal of the drug in two (10 %).

40|$|AbstractPurposeIctal motor {{phenomena}} play {{a crucial}} role in the localization of seizure focus in the management of <b>refractory</b> focal <b>epilepsy.</b> While the importance of unilateral automatisms is well established, little attention is paid to the contralateral relatively immobile limb. In cases where automatisms mimic clonic or dystonic movements and in the absence of previously well-established signs, unilateral relative ictal immobility (RII) is potentially useful as a lateralizing sign. This study was carried out to examine the lateralizing value of this sign and to define its characteristics among patients of <b>refractory</b> focal <b>epilepsy.</b> MethodsVEEGs of 69 consecutive patients of <b>refractory</b> focal <b>epilepsy</b> who had undergone epilepsy surgery at our center over last four years were reviewed and analyzed for the presence of RII. Unilateral RII was defined as a paucity of movement in one limb lasting for at least 10 s while the contralateral limb showed purposive or semi-purposive movements (in the absence of tonic or dystonic posturing or clonic movements in the involved limb). The findings were seen in the light of VEEG, radiological and nuclear imaging data, and with post-surgical outcome. ResultsUnilateral RII as a lateralizing sign was found in 24 of 69 patients (34. 78 %), consisting of both temporal and extra temporal epilepsy, with 100 % concordance with VEEG and MRI data. All patients demonstrating this sign had a good post-surgical outcome.

In this study, the authors explore the potential value of re-imaging at 3. 0 T patients with <b>refractory</b> partial <b>epilepsy</b> and negative 1. 5 T MRI. MethodsWe retrospectively identified all patients with <b>refractory</b> partial <b>epilepsy</b> candidate for surgery who had undergone a 3. 0 T MR study after a negative 1. 5 T MR study. High-field 3. 0 T MRIs were reviewed qualitatively by neuroradiologists experienced in interpreting epilepsy studies with access to clinical information. Relevance and impact on clinical management were assessed by an epileptologist. ResultsBetween November 2006 and August 2009, 36 patients with <b>refractory</b> partial <b>epilepsy</b> candidate for surgery underwent 3. 0 T MR study after a 1. 5 T MR study failed to disclose a relevant epileptogenic lesion. A potential lesion was found only in two patients (5. 6 %, 95 % CI: 1. 5 – 18. 1 %). Both {{were found to have}} hippocampal atrophy congruent with other presurgical localization techniques which resulted in omission of an invasive EEG study and direct passage to surgery. ConclusionsThe frequency of detection of a new lesion by re-imaging at 3. 0 T patients with <b>refractory</b> partial <b>epilepsy</b> candidate for surgery was found to be low, but seems to offer the potential of a significant clinical impact for selected patients. This finding needs to be validated in a prospective controlled study...|$|R
40|$|Epilepsy is {{the most}} common serious {{disorder}} of the brain and comprises a wide range of different conditions with varying aetiologies. The long-established antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) control seizures in 50 % of patients developing partial seizures, and 60 – 70 % of those developing generalized seizures. Several AEDs were made available in the 1990 s. These drugs have efficacy, but have had only a modest impact on those with <b>refractory</b> <b>epilepsies.</b> A 50 % seizure reduction, which is commonly used as an endpoint in clinical trials, confers little benefit to a patient. Of the newer AEDs, lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine are now licensed for use as monotherapy and vigabatrin has a monotherapy licence for infantile spasms. Careful and prolonged postmarketing surveillance is essential to detect adverse effects, which may not be evident in premarketing clinical trials. At this time, there are 10 AEDs currently in varying stages of clinical development. Current strategies for selecting an AED for a particular patient are crude. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic measures of cerebral neuro-transmitters and genetic analysis may allow better prediction of which drug is most likely to be efficacious and to have low risk of adverse effects. Present AEDs suppress the occurrence of seizures. Agents that prevent the development of epilepsy and which protect the brain from the consequences of seizures would be of great value, but {{it will be difficult to}} prove their effectiveness. At present AEDs are given continually and systemically. Local drug delivery is feasible and could avoid the adverse effects of AEDs. The combination of local drug delivery with prediction of seizure occurrence could revolutionize the treatment of currently <b>refractory</b> <b>epilepsies...</b>|$|R

40|$|Magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals, like electroencephalographic (EEG) measures, are {{the direct}} extracranial manifestations of {{neuronal}} activation.

50|$|Split-brain is a lay term to {{describe}} the result when the corpus callosum connecting the two hemispheres of the brain is severed to some degree.

The surgical operation to produce this condition (corpus callosotomy) involves transection of the corpus callosum, and is usually a last resort to treat <b>refractory</b> <b>epilepsy.</b> Initially, partial callosotomies are performed; if this operation does not succeed, a complete callosotomy is performed to mitigate the risk of accidental physical injury by reducing the severity and violence of epileptic seizures. Before using callosotomies, epilepsy is instead treated through pharmaceutical means. After surgery, neuropsychological assessments are often performed.|$|E
40|$|As {{described}} initially from {{clinical and}} experimental studies, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) plays {{a central role}} in the pharmacoresistance of epilepsy, acting by efflux of AEDs mainly at blood brain barrier (BBB) level. However, repetitive seizures can produce both brain and heart P-gp overexpression. Because P-gp activity induces membrane depolarization, its neuronal expression could be acting in the intrinsic mechanism of epileptogenesis, and its heart expression, can be a high risk factor of death, after severe-continuo convulsive stresses as in fatal status epilepticus or in SUDEP. Additionally, because P-gp is also a stem cell marker, we suggests that its constitutive overexpression in dysplastic neurons from brain epileptogenic areas observed in patients with <b>refractory</b> <b>epilepsies,</b> should be addressed as a risk factor of seizures relapse after surgical treatment. Here we discuss these concepts, based on our own clinical and experimental experiences, and reviewing the current literature on these subjects...|$|R

Patients with RE showed significantly higher HF and lower LF power and lower LF/HF ratio than controls, independent of the epilepsy group, and did not show significant differences in any other autonomic index with respect to the two control groups. In RE, we found a negative relationship between both seizure load and frequency of sleep interictal EEG abnormalities with parasympathetic drive levels.
