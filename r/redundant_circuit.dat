40|$|How {{does the}} brain {{keep track of}} {{relevant}} spatial locations when the eyes move? In extrastriate, parietal and frontal cortex, and in the superior colliculus, neurons update stimulus representations in conjunction with eye movements. This updating reflects a transfer of visual information, from neurons that encode a salient location before the saccade, to neurons that encode the location after the saccade. Copies of the oculomotor command - corollary discharge signals - likely initiate this transfer. Spatial updating, or remapping, is thought {{to contribute to the}} maintenance of stable spatial representations as the eyes move. We investigated the circuitry that supports spatial updating in the primate brain. Our central hypothesis was that the forebrain commissures provide the primary route for remapping spatial locations across visual hemifields, which entails the interhemispheric transfer of visual information. Further, we hypothesized that these commissures provide the primary route for corollary discharge signals, generated in one hemisphere, to initiate spatial updating in the opposite hemisphere. We tested these hypotheses by measuring spatial behavior and neural activity in two split-brain macaques. In behavioral experiments, we observed striking initial impairments in the monkeys' ability to update stimuli across visual hemifields. Surprisingly, however, we found that both animals were ultimately capable of performing these across-hemifield sequences. Both monkeys readily performed the same spatial task when updating required an interhemispheric transfer of corollary discharge signals, suggesting that these signals are transferred via subcortical pathways in the normal monkey. In physiological experiments, we found that neurons in lateral intraparietal cortex of the split-brain monkey can remap stimuli across visual hemifields, albeit with a reduction in the strength of remapping activity. These neurons were robustly active when within-hemifield updating was initiated by a saccade into the opposite hemifield. Our findings suggest that both visual and corollary discharge signals from opposite hemispheres can converge to update spatial representations {{in the absence of the}} forebrain commissures. These investigations provide new evidence that a unified and stable representation of visual space is supported by a <b>redundant</b> <b>circuit,</b> comprised of cortical as well as subcortical pathways, with a remarkable capacity for reorganization...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the degree Magister Technologiae: Electrical Engineering in the Faculty of Engineering at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology 2013 The space environment is characterised by harsh radiation, extreme temperatures and vacuum. Electronics subsystems for satellite applications {{are designed to be}} fault tolerant and robust enough to survive this environment. A power distribution module (PDM) for a CubeSat nanosatellite application is developed here, with the aim to distribute power to CubeSat subsystems reliably. The PDM prototype is carefully designed with reference to an extensive literature study. The study dwells on the low Earth orbit (LEO) space environment, critically identifying radiation sources and temperature ranges in the LEO. The study further investigates traditional analogue techniques of logic circuit design using bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) which are known for their higher tolerance to radiation sources as compared to recent integrated circuits (ICs). Careful consideration is given to different ways of designing a fault tolerant system. The study specifically looks at <b>redundant</b> <b>circuit</b> design within the limitations of weight and space of a nanosatellite. Possible electrical faults in power systems are identified, which include over-currents, over-voltages, over-temperatures, inrush currents and latchup. This study shows that identified faults generally are overcurrents. A power switch is included in each power distribution channel to trip the current in case a faulty condition is detected. The PDM is designed to have eight power output distribution channels to allow a subsystem load to connect to more than one channel, thereby meeting its power requirements. The PDM power channels are designed identically. Upon application, current limits are selected by a two-resistor divider circuit and connectors are used to connect to a required voltage bus at manufacturing time. The system’s functionality is tested and verified using an Arduino development board interfaced to all I 2 C devices as a master node, typically the on-board computer (OBC) in a real satellite mission. The system’s functionality in a Gamma irradiated laboratory environment is verified to perform as required. The PDM system is further tested in a temperature cycled chamber from - 31 °C to 61 °C. The system survived the entire eight hour test duration of two cycles. It is observed that the system is fault tolerant to radiation sources up to 10 krad and the temperature limits mentioned. The PDM system is recommended as an additional module to the CubeSat electrical power subsystem (EPS), thereby improving the reliability of the power subsystem.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Electric and Electronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. There is {{increasing}} use of commercial components in space technology {{and it is important}} to recognize that the space radiation environment poses the risk of permanent malfunction due to radiation. Therefore, the integrated circuits used for spacecraft electronics must be resistant to radiation. The effect of using the MOSFET device in a radiation environment is that the gate oxide becomes ionized by the dose it absorbs due to the radiation induced trapped charges in the gate-oxide. The trapped charges in the gate-oxide generate additional space charge fields at the oxide-substrate interface. After a sufficient dose, a large positive charge builds up, having the same effect as if a positive voltage was applied to the gate terminal. Therefore, the transistor source to drain current can no longer be controlled by the gate terminal and the device remains on permanently resulting in device failure. There are four processes involved in the radiation response of MOS devices. First, the ionizing radiation acts with the gate oxide layer to produce electron-hole pairs. Some fraction of the electron-hole pairs recombine depending on the type of incident particle and the applied gate to substrate voltage, i. e. the electric field. The mobility of the electron is orders of magnitude larger than that of the holes in the gate oxide, and is swept away very quickly in the direction of the gate terminal. The time for the electrons to be swept away is on the order of 1 ps. The holes that escape recombination remain near their point of origin. The number of these surviving holes determines the initial response of the device after a short pulse of radiation. The cause of the first process, i. e. the presence of the electric field, is the main motivation for design method described in this dissertation. The second process is the slow transport of holes toward the oxide-silicon interface due to the presence of the electric field. When the holes reach the interface, process 3, they become captured in long term trapping sites and this is the main cause of the permanent threshold voltage shift in MOS devices. The fourth process is the buildup of interface states in the substrate near the interface The main contribution of this dissertation is the development of the novel Switched Modular Redundancy (SMR) method for mitigating the effects of space radiation on satellite electronics. The overall idea of the SMR method is as follows: A charged particle is accelerated in the presence of an electric field. However, in a solid, electrons will move around randomly in the absence of an applied electric field. Therefore if one averages the movement over time there will be no overall motion of charge carriers in any particular direction. On applying an electric field charge carriers will on average move in a direction aligned with the electric field, with positive charge carriers such as holes moving in the direction of field, and negative charge carriers moving in the opposite direction. As is the case with process one and two above. It is proposed in this dissertation that if we apply the flatband voltage (normaly a zero bias for the ideal NMOS transistor) to the gate terminal of a MOS transistor in the presence of ionizing radiation, i. e. no electric field across the gate oxide, both the free electrons and holes will on average remain near their point of origin, and therefore have a greater probability of recombination. Thus, the threshold voltage shift in MOS devices will be less severe for the gate terminal in an unbiased condition. The flatband conditions for the real MOS transistor is discussed in appendix E. It was further proposed that by adding redundancy and applying a resting policy, one can significantly prolong the useful life of MOS components in space. The fact that the rate of the threshold voltage shift in MOS devices is dependant on the bias voltage applied to the gate terminal is a very important phenomenon that can be exploited, since we have direct control and access to the voltage applied to the gate terminal. If for example, two identical gates were under the influence of radiation and the gate voltage is alternated between the two, then the two gates should be able to withstand more total dose radiation than using only one gate. This redundancy could be used in a circuit to mitigate for total ionizing dose. The SMR methodology would be to duplicate each gate in a circuit, then selectively only activating one gate at a time allowing the other to anneal during its off cycle. The SMR algorithm was code in the “C” language. In the proposed design methodology, the design engineer need not be concerned about radiation effects when describing the hardware implementation in a hardware description language. Instead, the design engineer makes use of conventional design techniques. When the design is complete, it is synthesized to obtain the gate level netlist in edif format. The edif netlist is converted to structural VHDL code during synthesis. The structural VHDL netlist is fed into the SMR “C” algorithm to obtain the identical <b>redundant</b> <b>circuit</b> components. The resultant file is also a structural VHDL netlist. The generated VHDL netlist or SMR circuit can then be mapped to a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Spacecraft electronic designers increasingly demand high performance microprocessors and FPGAs, because of their high performance and flexibility. Because FPGAs are reprogrammable, they offer the additional benefits of allowing on-orbit design changes. Data can be sent after launch to correct errors or to improve system performance. System including FPGAs covers a wide range of space applications, and consequently, they are the object of this study in order to implement and test the SMR algorithm. We apply the principles of reconfigurable computing to implement the Switched Modular Redundancy Algorithm in order to mitigate for Total Ionizing Dose (TID) effects in FPGA’s. It is shown by means of experimentation that this new design technique provides greatly improved TID tolerance for FPGAs. This study was necessary in order to make the cost of satellite manufacturing as low as possible by making use of Commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. However, these COTS components are very susceptible to the hazards of the space environment. One could also make use of Radiation Hard components for the purpose of satellite manufacturing, however, this will defeat the purpose of making the satellite manufacturing cost as low as possible as the cost of the radiation hard electronic components are significantly higher than their commercial counterparts. Added to this is the undesirable fact that the radiation hard components are a few generations behind as far as speed and performance is concerned, thus providing even greater motivation for making use of Commercial components. Radiation hardened components are obtained by making use of special processing methods in order to improve the components radiation tolerance. Modifying the process steps is one of the three ways to improve the radiation tolerance of an integrated circuit. The two other possibilities are to use special layout techniques or special circuit and system architectures. Another method, in which to make Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon (CMOS) circuits tolerant to ionizing radiation is to distribute the workload among redundant modules (called Switched Modular Redundancy above) in the circuit. This new method will be described in detail in this thesis...|$|E

Nevertheless, it is powerful enough to analyze the common proof strategies (monolithic, forward and backward) applied in automated verification of such networks. This analysis leads to an incremental verification method, based on successive construction of the weakest pre-conditions, in which the backward proof is driven by the property being verigied. In the case of ginite synchronous networks this construction can be carried out via simple manipulations on circuits, and circuit optimizers can be used incrementally to simplify the complexity of such backward proofs.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} in detail a new method {{for the single}} gate-level design error diagnosis in combinational circuits. Distinctive features of the method are hierarchical approach (the localizing procedure starts at the macro level and finishes at the gate level), use of stuck-at fault model (it is mapped into design error domain only in the end), and design error diagnostic procedure that uses only test patterns generated by conventional gate-level stuck-at fault test pattern generators (ATPG). No special diagnostic tests are used because {{they are much more}} time consuming. Binary decision diagrams (BDD) are exploited for representing and localizing stuck-at faults on the higher signal path level. On the basis of detected faulty signal paths, suspected stuck-at faults at gate inputs are calculated, and then mapped into suspected design error(s). This method is enhanced compared to our previous work. It is applicable to <b>redundant</b> <b>circuits</b> and allows using incomplete tests for error diagnosis.

First part of this thesis deals with description of types of mistakes and with attempts of theirs modelling. Second part of this thesis narrate possibilities of preventing each type of mistake during designing the system or during operation of microcontroller and explaining methods of fault toleration by using <b>redundant</b> <b>circuits</b> in case of hardware fault and by modifying source code in case of software faults. In third part the hazard analytical methods are described. The recognition of events able to damage the system has high importance. The risk analysis takes place during developing and during operation of the system. Fourth part is trying to describe some of the processor testing techniques as main method of finding errors before operating use of microcontroller. Last part attempts to practical draft of testing algorithm for chosen microprocessor and application of one of analytical techniques...|$|R
