5|$|The {{earliest}} known religious monument is the Catholic holy well in Penrhys first {{mentioned in}} the 15th century, though {{it may have been}} a place of pagan worship before this. This pilgrimage site was identified as a 'manor' belonging to the Cistercian Abbey of Llantarnam and was seen as one of the most important religious sites in Wales, because of its Marian shrine. This holy site was the main <b>reason</b> <b>people</b> would pass through the commote; it was even thought to be the main reason why the first bridges were built over the River Rhondda.|$|E
5|$|Like ale, aloviti men led hail-producing and {{thunderstorm}} clouds: {{when the}} skies darkened, {{such a man}} would fall into a trance, and his spirit would fly out of his body toward the clouds as if his spirit were an ala herself. There was, however, a significant difference– he never led the clouds over the fields of his own village; the damage was done to the neighboring villages. In this respect, aloviti men are equivalent to zduhaći. Besides leading clouds away, an aloviti man could also fight against ale to protect his village. Children, too, could be aloviti, and they fought ale using plough beams. In these fights they were helped by the Aesculapian snake (smuk in Serbian), and for this <b>reason</b> <b>people</b> would not hurt these snakes.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps the <b>reason</b> <b>people</b> rarely {{talk about}} his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get them together {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got them together so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it — but happily so.|$|E

25|$|We can {{extrapolate}} {{from the}} above table that the step size needed to get an answer that is correct to three decimal places is approximately 0.00001, meaning that we need 400,000 steps. This large number of steps entails a high computational cost. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>people</b> usually employ alternative, higher-order methods such as Runge–Kutta methods or linear multistep methods, especially if a high accuracy is desired.|$|E
25|$|Shortness {{of breath}} {{is the primary}} reason 3.5% of people present to the {{emergency}} department in the United States. Of these individuals, approximately 51% are {{admitted to the hospital}} and 13% are dead within a year. Some studies have suggested that up to 27% of people suffer from dyspnea, while in dying patients 75% will experience it.

25|$|These {{explanations}} are complementary rather than mutually exclusive—all instances of behaviour require an explanation {{at each of}} these four levels. For example, the function of eating is to acquire nutrients (which ultimately aids survival and reproduction), but the immediate cause of eating is hunger (causation). Hunger and eating are evolutionarily ancient and are found in many species (evolutionary history), and develop early within an organism's lifespan (development). It is easy to confuse such questions—for example, to argue that people eat because they're hungry and not to acquire nutrients—without realizing that the <b>reason</b> <b>people</b> experience hunger is because it causes them to acquire nutrients.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{insurance}} products and practices {{have been described}} as rent-seeking by critics. That is, some {{insurance products}} or practices are useful primarily because of legal benefits, such as reducing taxes, as opposed to providing protection against risks of adverse events. Under United States tax law, for example, most owners of variable annuities and variable life insurance can invest their premium payments in the stock market and defer or eliminate paying any taxes on their investments until withdrawals are made. Sometimes this tax deferral is the only <b>reason</b> <b>people</b> use these products. Another example is the legal infrastructure which allows life insurance to be held in an irrevocable trust which is used to pay an estate tax while the proceeds themselves are immune from the estate tax.|$|E
25|$|The Guarijíos {{are one of}} {{the least}} {{understood}} groups in the state, and are mostly restricted to an area called the Mesa del Matapaco in the southeast. The Guarijíos are related to the Tarahumaras and the Cáhitas. This was the first group encountered by the Jesuits in 1620. Initially, they lived in the area around what is now Álamos, but when the Spaniards arrived, they were dispossessed of their lands. They also did not intermarry with the newcomers, isolating themselves. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>people</b> of this group have very distinct facial features, and have keep their traditions almost completely intact. They remain isolated but are known for their handcrafts. In the 1970s, there was oppression of this group, which was not formally recognized until 1976. In this year, they were granted an ejido.|$|E

25|$|The {{treatment}} for a snakebite is as variable as the bite itself. The most common and effective method is through antivenom (or antivenin), a serum made from the venom of the snake. Some antivenom is species-specific (monovalent) while some is made for use with multiple species in mind (polyvalent). In the United States for example, all species of venomous snakes are pit vipers, {{with the exception of}} the coral snake. To produce antivenom, a mixture of the venoms of the different species of rattlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths is injected into the body of a horse in ever-increasing dosages until the horse is immunized. Blood is then extracted from the immunized horse. The serum is separated and further purified and freeze-dried. It is reconstituted with sterile water and becomes antivenom. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>people</b> who are allergic to horses are more likely to suffer an allergic reaction to antivenom. Antivenom for the more dangerous species (such as mambas, taipans, and cobras) is made in a similar manner in India, South Africa, and Australia, although these antivenoms are species-specific.|$|E
25|$|On 6 November 1990, Chikatilo {{killed and}} {{mutilated}} a 22-year-old woman, named Svetlana Korostik, in woodland near Donleskhoz station. While leaving the crime scene, he was observed by an undercover officer. The policeman observed Chikatilo approach a well and wash {{his hands and}} face. When he approached the station, the undercover officer noted that Chikatilo's coat had grass and soil stains on the elbows. Chikatilo also had a small red smear on his cheek. To the officer, he looked suspicious. The only <b>reason</b> <b>people</b> entered woodland near the station {{at that time of}} year was to gather wild mushrooms (a popular pastime in Russia), but Chikatilo was not dressed like a typical forest scavenger; he was wearing more formal attire. Moreover, he had a nylon sports bag, which was unsuitable for carrying mushrooms. The policeman stopped Chikatilo and checked his papers, but had no formal reason to arrest him. When the policeman returned to his office, he filed a routine report, containing the name of the person he had stopped at the station.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{approach}} {{was that it was}} very difficult to focus the electron guns on the ridges without the signal bleeding over to the ridges on either side. This problem was compounded by the changing angle between the gun and the ridges as the signal progressed down the screen. Similar designs were attempted by a number of researchers, the best known being the Geer tube that used pyramid-shaped patterns with three guns arranged around the back. None of these systems could ever be made to work reliably, with focussing and alignment being continual problems. There is no documentary evidence that a successful version of the three-gun Telechrome tube was ever built, although images of Baird holding a prototype are widely duplicated. The prototype that usually appears is the two-gun tube. The two-gun tube actually had three necks. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>people</b> often mistake this tube for a three-gun prototype. In fact, the third neck is the original neck from the Hewittic envelope. This third neck holds not a gun, but instead, supports for the two-sided target. Burns published a typical photo of the two-gun, three-neck tube.|$|E

25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the <b>reason</b> <b>people</b> act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they only see the short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one {{who knows how to}} swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, he points to the fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had when he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E

He later said that [...] "All in all, Skeet Shoot wasn't a spectacular game to start off with." [...] Despite the poor publicity, the game sold very well.|$|E
500|$|Iodine-131 (usually as iodide) is a {{component}} of nuclear fallout, and is particularly dangerous owing to the thyroid gland's propensity to concentrate ingested iodine and retain it for periods longer than this isotope's radiological half-life of eight days. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>people</b> at risk of exposure to environmental radioactive iodine (iodine-131) in fallout may be instructed to take non-radioactive potassium iodide tablets. The typical adult dose is one 130mg tablet per 24 hours, supplying 100mg (100,000 micrograms) of ionic iodine. (The typical daily dose of iodine for normal health is of order 100 micrograms; see [...] "Dietary Intake" [...] below.) Ingestion of this large dose of non-radioactive iodine minimises the uptake of radioactive iodine by the thyroid gland.|$|E

500|$|Iron uptake is tightly {{regulated}} by the human body, which has no regulated physiological means of excreting iron. Only small amounts of iron are lost daily due to mucosal and skin epithelial cell sloughing, so control of iron levels is primarily accomplished by regulating uptake. Regulation of iron uptake is impaired in some people {{as a result of}} a genetic defect that maps to the HLA-H gene region on chromosome 6 and leads to abnormally low levels of hepcidin, a key regulator of the entry of iron into the circulatory system in mammals. In these people, excessive iron intake can result in iron overload disorders, known medically as hemochromatosis. Many people have an undiagnosed genetic susceptibility to iron overload, and are not aware of a family history of the problem. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>people</b> should not take iron supplements unless they suffer from iron deficiency and have consulted a doctor. Hemochromatosis is estimated to be the cause of 0.3 to 0.8% of all metabolic diseases of Caucasians.|$|E

Billingsley rented out the hat and coat check area to a separate concession for $27,000 a year. [...] This paid the rent for the Stork Club, leaving $15,000 annually to cover bad checks.
