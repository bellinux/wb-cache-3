25|$|Most modern {{railways}} use continuous {{welded rail}} (CWR), {{sometimes referred to as}} <b>ribbon</b> <b>rails.</b> In this form of track, the rails are welded together by utilising flash butt welding to form one continuous rail that may be several kilometres long. Because there are few joints, this form of track is very strong, gives a smooth ride, and needs less maintenance; trains can travel on it at higher speeds and with less friction. Welded rails are more expensive to lay than jointed tracks, but have much lower maintenance costs. The first welded track was used in Germany in 1924 and the US in 1930 and has become common on main lines since the 1950s.|$|E

At Highbridge Yard, the train followed the track as it merged onto those used by Metro-North Railroad's Hudson Line commuter rail service from Grand Central Station to points along the east bank of the Hudson River as far north as Poughkeepsie. It was one of four such waste trains that regularly use the Hudson Line's tracks each night; two northbound with full containers and two southbound returning the emptied ones.There are generally two tracks along this stretch, both electrified with third rails for Metro-North's electric multiple unit trains serving the stations along the Hudson Line south of Croton-Harmon in Westchester County. With a few exceptions, they are immediately adjacent to the river and almost completely level. They consist of <b>ribbon</b> <b>rail</b> laid in standard gauge on prestressed concrete ties supported by a bed of crushed trap rock ballast.|$|R
