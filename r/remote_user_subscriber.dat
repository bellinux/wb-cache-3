40|$|<b>Remote</b> {{authentication}} of <b>users</b> {{supported by}} passwords is a broadly adopted method of authentication within insecure network environments. Such protocols typically rely on pre-established secure cryptographic keys or public key infrastructure. Recently, Peyravian and Jeffries [M. Peyravian, C.

Recently, many secure ID based <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> authentication scheme using smart card have been proposed in the literature.

So, their scheme can not be used for practical implementation in terms of security. Further, their scheme takes more computation and communication cost than the proposed scheme. To overcome these weakness, we have proposed an efficient secure ID based <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> authentication scheme using smart card based on cryptographic one way hash function. The proposed scheme resists all possible attacks and provides better computation and communication cost than Ratan-Sanjay’s [1] scheme published earlier. Keywords...|$|R

Considering this security drawback, researchers are trying to find solution with multifactor <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> authentication system. Recently, three factor <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> authentication using biometric and smart card has drawn a considerable attention of the researchers. However, most of the current proposed schemes have security flaws. They are vulnerable to attacks like user impersonation attack, server masquerading attack, password guessing attack, insider attack, denial of service attack, forgery attack, etc. Also, most of them are unable to provide mutual authentication, session key agreement and password, or smart card recovery system. Considering these drawbacks, we propose a secure three factor user authentication scheme using biometric and smart card.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to explore the}} <b>remote</b> <b>users</b> of services available public university libraries in Kenya. Scarce literature was available locally {{on the subject of}} the study. Provision of quality and relevant information services to support teaching, learning and research remains a central objective of libraries in higher education world over. Higher education institutions in Kenya continue to experience unprecedented growth in student population against limited human capital and physical infrastructure, among the library services. This reality has prompted Universities to adopt different education delivery models; distant learning, e-learning, and part time modules to accommodate the extra numbers seeking higher education. Depending on the preferred module, the students can be categorized into three main groups: on-campus, off-campus and <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> groups. Higher learning standards require that all users to have equitable and inclusive access to resources. This study explores the nature and availability of support services and resources available for <b>remote</b> library <b>users</b> in public university libraries in Kenya. The research methodology adopted was a descriptive research design; where qualitative data was collected using Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). The findings revealed that public university libraries in Kenya have various forms of resources and services that can support <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> needs. However they face certain challenges that hinder the use of the available <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> resources and services in providing equitable access to information services to all its types of users. Key among the challenges was that <b>remote</b> <b>users</b> were not identified as a special user group in the libraries studied contrary to what the study grounded. The results of the study are discussed under three main thematic areas: services for <b>remote</b> <b>users,</b> facilities available for <b>remote</b> <b>users,</b> and policies and regulations that govern remote use of library resources.

40|$|Robotic {{telepresence}} systems—videoconferencing {{systems that}} allow a <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> {{to drive around}} in another location— provide an alternative to video-mediated communications {{as a way of}} interacting over distances. These systems, which are seeing increasing use in business and medical settings, are unique in their ability to grant the <b>remote</b> <b>user</b> the ability to maneuver in a distant location. While this mobility promises increased feelings of “being there ” for <b>remote</b> <b>users</b> and thus greater support for task collaboration, whether these promises are borne out, providing benefits in task performance, is un-known. To better understand the role that mobility plays in shaping the <b>remote</b> <b>user’s</b> sense of presence and its poten-tial benefits, we conducted a two-by-two (system mobility: stationary vs. mobile; task demands for mobility: low vs. high) controlled laboratory experiment. We asked participants (N = 40) to collaborate in a construction task with a confed-erate via a robotic telepresence system. Our results showed that mobility significantly increased the <b>remote</b> <b>user’s</b> feelings of presence, particularly in tasks with high mobility require-ments, but decreased task performance. Our findings highlight the positive effects of mobility on feelings of “being there,” while illustrating the need to design support for effective use of mobility in high-mobility tasks.
