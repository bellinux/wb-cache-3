30|$|The stage design {{strength}} ratio {{as a percentage}} is determined using Eq.  1 based on {{the difference between the}} design <b>relative</b> <b>strength,</b> S(T), estimated for a given design load applications level, W(T), and the stage <b>relative</b> <b>strength,</b> S(t), associated with a specified stage load applications value, W(t), that is {{less than or equal to}} the design load applications level, W(T). The design <b>relative</b> <b>strength,</b> S(T), is constant for a given design load applications level, W(T), while the stage <b>relative</b> <b>strength,</b> S(t), is variable depending on the value of the stage load applications, W(t).

The stage period (t) starts from time zero and not from an intermediate time as typically done in a conventional two-stage design approach.

For furtheranalysis “Post-Hoc Test” (LSD Test) was applied. The obtained value of “F-ratio” (37. 974) was greater than the tabulated value (3. 18).

30|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to investigate a}} possible relationship between the accelerated pavement deterioration rates and pavement design strength using a two-stage design analysis approach. The deployed approach applies a two-stage solution to the three popular design methods of flexible pavement to yield pavement designs using stage load applications values specified for each investigated design load applications level. The resulting two-stage pavement designs are then used to obtain an indicator called the stage design strength ratio (percentage) defined as {{the ratio of the}} <b>relative</b> <b>strength</b> change to the design <b>relative</b> <b>strength.</b> The <b>relative</b> <b>strength</b> change is the difference between the design <b>relative</b> <b>strength</b> associated with a design load applications level and stage <b>relative</b> <b>strength</b> associated with a stage load applications value that is {{less than or equal to}} the design load applications level. It basically provides a measure of strength difference resulting from two pavement designs obtained using two distinct loading conditions. Then, the derived values of stage design strength ratio are compared to the deployed stage load applications values.|$|R

25|$|Food versus fuel is {{the dilemma}} {{regarding}} {{the risk of}} diverting farmland or crops for biofuels production {{to the detriment of}} the food supply. The biofuel and food price debate involves wide-ranging views, and is a long-standing, controversial one in the literature.

This complexity and uncertainty is due to the large number of impacts and feedback loops that can positively or negatively affect the price system. Moreover, the <b>relative</b> <b>strengths</b> of these positive and negative impacts vary in the short and long terms, and involve delayed effects.

In regards to the Han armies, Chao deemed the Xiongnu horsemen better prepared for rough terrain due to their better horses, better with horseback archery, and better able to withstand the elements and harsh climates. However, on level plains, he regarded Xiongnu cavalry inferior especially when faced with Han shock cavalry and chariots as the Xiongnu are easily dispersed. He emphasized that the Xiongnu were incapable of countering the superior equipment and weaponry. He also noted that in contrast the Han armies were better capable to fight in disciplined formations. According to Chao, the Xiongnu were also defenseless against coordinated onslaughts of arrows—especially long-ranged and in unison—due to their inferior leather armor and wooden shields. When dismounted in close combat, {{he believed that the}} Xiongnu, lacking the ability as infantry, would be decimated by Han soldiers.|$|E

40|$|In {{markets with}} trading friction, the {{incorporation}} of information into market prices can be substantially delayed through a weakening of the arbitrage process. We re-examine the profitability of <b>relative</b> <b>strength</b> trading strategies (buying past strong performers and selling past weak performers) by testing the predictions of a friction-based explanation. We provide a model of price friction and then use this model to infer trading costs from investor behavior. We find that the execution of standard <b>relative</b> <b>strength</b> strategies requires large trading costs because of the type and frequency of securities traded such that trading costs prevent profitable <b>relative</b> <b>strength</b> investing. In the cross section, we find evidence that trading costs provide binding constraints to <b>relative</b> <b>strength</b> strategy profits. <b>Relative</b> <b>strength</b> returns are localized among low-price, poor performers and are increasing in investor transaction costs.

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} over the <b>relative</b> <b>strengths</b> {{of different types of}} research. Because randomized trials provide clear, objective evidence on “what works”, policy makers often take only those studies into consideration. Some scholars have pushed for more random experiments in which teaching methods are randomly assigned to classes. In other disciplines concerned with human subjects, like biomedicine, psychology, and policy evaluation, controlled, randomized experiments remain the preferred method of evaluating treatments. Educational statisticians and some mathematics educators have been working to increase the use of randomized experiments to evaluate teaching methods. On the other hand, many scholars in educational schools have argued against increasing the number of randomized experiments, often because of philosophical objections, such as the ethical difficulty of randomly assigning students to various treatments when the effects of such treatments are not yet known to be effective, or the difficulty of assuring rigid control of the independent variable in fluid, real school settings.|$|E
