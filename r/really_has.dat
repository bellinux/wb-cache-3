25|$|A Carnatic {{composition}} <b>really</b> <b>has</b> two elements, {{one being}} the musical element, the other being what is conveyed in the composition. It is {{probably because of}} this fact that most Carnatic music compositions are composed for singing. In addition to the rich musical experience, each composition brings out the knowledge and personality of the composer, and hence the words {{are as important as}} the musical element itself. This poses a special challenge for the musicians because rendering this music does not involve just playing or singing the correct musical notes; the musicians are expected to understand what was conveyed by the composer in various languages, and sing musical phrases that act to create the effect that was intended by the composer in his/her composition.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Sindhu <b>really</b> <b>has</b> {{fallen for}} JKB {{and both of}} them get {{intimate}} with each other. One day, JKB is caught coming out of Sindhu's apartment by Bhairavi. Sindhu is seen as the home wrecker and is forced to quit her association with JKB. He pines for her and leans on alcohol for support, which sadly leads to his downward spiral ending in an embarrassing barter of his musical knowledge for a drink. He even steals money from Bhairavi's grandfather, which leads to his death. Sindhu reenters his life and brings him around, however she has a secret of her own, the secret of her pregnancy. After Sindhu brings back JKB from his alcoholic state, JKB's friends pressurize Sindhu to leave the town and to never come back, which she does the very next day. Both Bhairavi and JKB are distraught as Bhairavi had agreed to marry Sindhu to JKB.|$|E

Actor Michael Gaston's arm, immersed in a special gel, was actually inflamed and then extinguished after filming was cut. Then, Gaston's stand-in, stuntman Don Hewitt, Jr, was completely set on fire. Hewitt wore the same costume, a wig, a face shield, and was also covered in a flammable gel. It was Gaston's final episode with the series.|$|E

500|$|As July {{approached}} {{and came to}} its close, Tancredo's standing improved somewhat with the looming Ames Straw Poll. His strategy to focus on Iowa continued, {{and the number of}} grassroots supporters in the state increased. On July 31, the campaign developed an interesting new strategy, offering a trip to Washington, D.C. and a tour of the capitol to anyone who brought 25 Tancredo supporters to the straw poll. On the day before, supporters in Iowa distributed T-shirts which read [...] "I'm a Member of Tom's Army Against Amnesty." [...] Interviewed supporters were asked why they supported the candidate, they replied, [...] "He <b>really</b> <b>has</b> the concerns of America at heart, he's concerned about the culture of America itself.

500|$|The film {{attracted}} 236,189 viewers at the French box office. Time Out gave a favourable review, {{calling the}} film a [...] "welcome {{addition to the}} post-holocaust barbarism [...] boom." [...] Steve Macfarlane from Not Coming to a Theater Near You gave a moderately positive review, stating [...] "While the film’s heart is syrupy-sentimental (who’s shocked?), its surfaces are clean, incremental, reverently silent—appropriate, given that ... humankind has lost its ability to speak." [...] Janet Maslin from The New York Times called it [...] "a bravura first film, using the simplest means, yet managing to incorporate humor, pathos, suspense and even a well-articulated definition of basic human needs." [...] Dave Kehr from the Chicago Reader also gave a positive review, stating: [...] "The absence of dialogue ... is a cleverly executed stunt, {{but it is also}} an effective alibi for a technically proficient filmmaker who <b>really</b> <b>has</b> nothing to say.

500|$|The {{original}} {{character of}} Gerda, known as Anna, {{was one of}} the three major characters in the script at this time, along with the Snow Queen, Elsa and Kristoff, loosely based on Kay. The characters were not considered to be well-rounded or relatable, but an interpersonal, family dynamic was created once Anna and Elsa were established as sisters, an idea suggested by someone on the writing team that no one remembered who. This changed the story dramatically, shifting from the conflict between the good and the evil to the conflict between love and fear. Buck stated that their script still retained basic parts of the story and the character of Gerda, citing the similarities between the original story and his version, [...] " [...] won't give up on finding her friend Kai. The only thing she <b>really</b> <b>has</b> in her, she's not a superhero or anything, but she has love. And it's love that conquers fear in the end." ...|$|E

Taibbi begins to change his views after personally visiting speeches by Trump at campaign stops in the beginning portion of 2016. In an election dispatch from September 2016, Taibbi writes, [...] "I still don’t think Trump <b>really</b> <b>has</b> a chance, but we’re sure headed towards a scary ending." [...] In October, he states, [...] "Trump can’t win. Our national experiment can’t end because one ageing narcissist got bored of sex and food. Not even America deserves that." [...] The book castigates Republican tactics of engaging in culture wars, writing they are, [...] "taking {{advantage of the fact}} that their voters didn’t know the difference between an elitist and the actual elite, between a snob and an oligarch." [...] Taibbi documents how Trump's inflammatory campaign rhetoric, often over social media including Twitter, garnered him increased publicity which led to increased influence.|$|E

500|$|In February 2009, The Hollywood Reporter {{revealed}} Robert Englund {{would not}} reprise {{the role of}} Freddy Krueger for the remake; Englund had performed the role for the eight previous films. On April 3, 2009 Entertainment Weekly reported that Jackie Earle Haley was cast to take over Englund's most well-known role. Initially, the studio wanted to cast an unknown {{for the role of}} Freddy Krueger, but it was Haley's performance in Little Children that impressed Emmerich enough to cast the actor against the original intentions. Emmerich explained, [...] "Freddy is this incredible stew of malevolence and anger, but he also has a hint of vulnerability, and Jackie <b>really</b> <b>has</b> all of that and more. He just seemed completely right for the part." [...] Bayer stated that he and producers Form and Fuller managed to acquire the screen test Haley gave as Rorschach for Watchmen; after viewing it, Bayer said it [...] "blew [...] mind", and that he knew Haley would be able to go deep and create a believable character who was a [...] " [...] with a burned face and a claw".|$|E

I welcome {{the opportunity to do}} something new to continue to entertain my audience. What I loved about Laura—and what people loved about Laura—is that she is a terrific memory, but it’s just not there anymore." [...] Soap Opera Digest later confirmed the character's name to be Genevieve Atkinson. Co-head writer of The Young and the Restless, Scott Hamner, stated that the role {{was going to be a}} [...] "very, very different character than we've seen Genie Francis portray". Bell opened up about hiring Francis, revealing: [...] "Genie is amazing and a real pro. I put pen and paper and she ran with it.

500|$|American Pagan studies scholar Aidan A. Kelly {{similarly}} rejected Liddell's claims. Kelly highlighted that whereas Liddell {{had claimed}} that Gardnerian Wicca had adopted {{the concept of}} a female coven leader from French and Scandinavian witch covens, the historical evidence clearly showed that Gardner developed {{the concept of a}} coven being led by a high priestess during the late 1950s, thus disproving Liddell's assertions. He noted that Liddell's claim that Crowley wrote Gardner's Book of Shadows [...] "cannot possibly be true" [...] because Crowley died before the Book was written. Kelly believed that either Liddell or his Elders had purposely created a [...] "phony history" [...] in order {{to hide the fact that}} Gardner had invented Wicca in its entirety in the early 1950s. Similarly, in a 2014 article about Pickingill in The Cauldron, Richard Ward argued that Liddell's claims did not stand up under scrutiny, and that they had simply been made in an attempt to promote claims regarding the existence of a [...] "pre-Gardnerian tradition" [...] of witchcraft. Liddell has specifically denied any charges that he was deliberately falsifying claims to make Gardnerian Wicca appear to have an older pedigree than it <b>really</b> <b>has.</b>|$|E
