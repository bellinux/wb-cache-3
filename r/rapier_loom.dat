5000|$|Rapier loom: This type of weaving is very versatile, in that <b>rapier</b> <b>looms</b> can weave using a large {{variety of}} threads. There are {{several types of}} rapiers, but they all use a hook system {{attached}} to a rod or metal band to pass the pick across the shed. These machines regularly reach 700 picks per minute in normal production.|$|R
50|$|All Harris Tweed is hand woven on a treadle loom at each weaver's {{home on a}} 'double-width' Bonas-Griffith <b>rapier</b> <b>loom</b> in {{the case}} of mill weavers, or {{normally}} an older 'single width' Hattersley loom {{in the case of}} independent weavers. The weaver will 'tie in' their warp by threading each end of yarn through the eyelets of their loom's heddles in a specific order then begins to weave, fixing any mistakes or breakages that occur until completed.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{power looms}} used a shuttle {{to throw the}} weft across, but in 1927 the faster and more {{efficient}} shuttleless loom came into use. Sulzer Brothers, a Swiss company had the exclusive rights to shuttleless looms in 1942, and licensed the American production to Warner & Swasey. Draper licensed the slower <b>rapier</b> <b>loom.</b> Today, advances in technology have produced a variety of looms designed to maximise production for specific types of material. The most common of these are Sulzer shuttleless weaving machines, rapier looms, air-jet looms and water-jet looms.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the original machines, Lancashire Museums also display other textile machines they own or are restoring, and weave some specialist commissions.One of the commissions is a blue and white shirting that is sold exclusively to 'Old Town' of Holt, Norfolk, who produce Victorian workware. Another is weaving woollen Jewish prayer shawls. There is a large Hattersley Standard Loom, and a treadle operated Hattersley Domestic Loom. There is a Sulzer, and a Saurer telescopic <b>rapier</b> <b>loom</b> that operates at 180 picks per minute. There {{is a collection of}} shuttles and machines used to make and maintain them. Also, there are machines for making reeds and healds.|$|E
5000|$|An air-jet loom is a {{shuttleless}} loom {{that uses a}} jet of air to propel the weft yarn through the shed. It {{is one of two}} types of fluid-jet looms, the other being a water-jet loom, which was developed previously. [...] Fluid-jet looms can operate at a faster speed than predecessor <b>looms</b> such as <b>rapier</b> <b>looms,</b> but they are not as common.|$|R
25|$|The Lancashire Loom was {{the first}} {{semi-automatic}} loom. Jacquard looms and Dobby looms are looms that have sophisticated methods of shedding. They may be separate looms, or mechanisms added to a plain loom. A Northrop Loom was fully automatic and was mass produced between 1909 and the mid-1960s. Modern looms run faster and do not use a shuttle: there are air jet looms, water jet <b>looms</b> and <b>rapier</b> <b>looms.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the Weaving Mill {{the warp}} and the weft were turned into textile {{by means of}} looms. The Museum {{presents}} a varied collection: manual vertical looms {{dating back to the}} Lusatian Culture (700-400 B.C.), wooden manual harness looms, and shuttleless pneumatic and <b>rapier</b> <b>looms</b> (1960s). On one of them we have a weaving process demonstrated. The exhibition is completed by rich collection of the pattern cards punching machines which controlled the Jacquard and harness looms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} of the <b>rapier</b> <b>loom</b> began in 1844, when John Smith of Salford was granted a patent on a loom design that eliminated the shuttle typical of earlier models of looms. Subsequent patents were taken out by Phillippe and Maurice in 1855, W.S. Laycock in 1869, and W. Glover in 1874, with rigid rapiers being perfected by O. Hallensleben in 1899. The main breakthrough came in 1922 when John Gabler invented the principle of loop transfer {{in the middle of}} the shed. Flexible rapiers of the type used today were proposed in 1925 by the Spanish inventor R.G. Moya, while R. Dewas introduced the idea of grasping the weft at its tip by the giver or a carrier rapier and transferring it to the taker or a receiver {{in the middle of the}} shed. It was not until the 1950s and 1960s that rapier weaving became fully commercialized, with loom technology developing rapidly.|$|E

40|$|In an {{existing}} <b>rapier</b> <b>loom,</b> when the rapier comes {{out from the}} shed, the tension of the weft yam changes before the reed reaches the fabric fell. Also in case of elastic yam, a certain length of the yam may retract due to the elastic nature of the yam. With the existing systems of rapier looms, weft yam tension cannot be controlled until the weft is interlaced into the fabric. Because of the above reasons the quality, selvage and appearance of the fabric could be impaired...|$|E
50|$|The flying shuttle {{dominated}} commercial weaving {{through the}} middle of the twentieth century. By that time, other systems had begun to supplant it. The heavy shuttle was noisy and energy-inefficient (since the energy used to throw it was largely lost in the catching); also, its inertia limited the speed of the <b>loom.</b> Projectile and <b>rapier</b> <b>looms</b> eliminated the need to take the bobbin/pirn of thread through the shed; later, air- and water-jet looms reduced the weight of moving parts further. Flying shuttle looms are still used for some purposes, and old models remain in use.|$|R
50|$|Next {{process in}} the textile {{production}} is fabric manufacturing. Fabric Manufacturing laboratory has variety of weaving machines from hand loom to high speed air jet loom. This laboratory consist of dobby and jacquard hand looms, dobby and jacquard shuttle looms, terry towel <b>looms,</b> <b>rapier</b> dobby and jacquard looms, air jet loom, sectional warping machine and sizing machine.|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out {{to find out the}} effects of various {{parameters}} on efficiency in <b>rapier</b> <b>looms.</b> To do so, the efficiency is analyzed by various parameters such as weaver’s skillness, loom speed, weave structure, pick density and R. H%, loom allocation per weaver, size take up %, tension on warp etc. The main objective {{of this study is to}} increase the efficiency and through that increase the productivity and profitability. Unlike in winding, warping and sizing where the emphasis is on the quality of preparation, in the loom shed, control of fabric quality as well as of productivity assumes significant importance. The weaving operation contributes by far the largest proportion to the cost of conversion of yarn into fabric. Surveys shown that the cost of actual weaving operation in mills with modern preparatory machines and automatic looms about 60 %- 65 % of the total cost for conversion of yarn into fabric. This means that a small increase in loom shed efficiency via productivity will result in considerable reduction of manufacturing cost. More importantly an increase in efficiency will bring in additional realization on the extra fabric available. For a medium size average mill, an increase of 2 % in loom shed productivity can increase the annual cash flow by about Tk. Ten lakhs. Consequently, in evolving a satisfactory process control programmed for the loom shed, considerable weight age should be given to efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, the {{flexibility}} of the cross axis and furcated frame of high speed <b>rapier</b> <b>loom</b> was considered through the change of the two components ’ material. Corresponding neutral documents were generated in ANSYS, then with the ANSYS-ADAMS co-simulation, those neutral documents were imported into ADAMS. The motion curves of sword belt were received. Through the map analysis and comparison, the relationship of changing the two components ’ material and the motion curves of sword belt were found. The simulation results show that, in consideration of the flexible components, rational selection of the component material can greatly reduce the impact on Spatial four bar linkage weft insertion mechanism, thereby enhance the quality of the fabric...|$|E

40|$|Most {{software}} is being implemented using imperative programming techniques. However, for certain problem domains declarative code {{has proven to}} be more expressive, easier to understand and more compact than its imperative counterpart. Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) seems to be a promising approach for intermixing imperative program code with declarative aspect information using an aspect weaver tool. The dynamic <b>Rapier</b> <b>LOOM.</b> NET weaver recognizes metadata in the form of. NET attributes, thus allowing the mixture of imperative and declarative programming styles using AOP techniques. We discuss in this paper the declarative Design by Contract architectural concept, which is based on assertions, e. g. invariants, pre- and postconditions. We have developed an aspect representation of the concept’s assertions {{in the form of a}} set of metadata for Microsoft’s. NET languages. Our approach has been applied to a large real-world application for which we give an evaluation. The paper aims to demonstrate the applicability of AOP techniques for describing the semantics of object-oriented interfaces based on the Design by Contract concept...|$|E
