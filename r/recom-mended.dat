40|$|T H E author's motive in {{publishing}} {{the results of}} this investigation was a desire to devise adequate treatment for the great number of victims of crush injury occurring in the war zones. Some weeks before the invasion of France on June 6, 1944, the author sent an extensively documented article to the Headquarters of the Medical Staffs of the Allied Armies which sum-marized the results of a study begun one year previously (June, 1943). This study led him to recommend a new therapy for two diseases of high mor-tality frequently occurring in the war zones, crush injury and transfusion kidney. Although the new treatment (which includes bilateral decapsulation of the kidneys) in practically all respects is just the opposite of that <b>recom-mended</b> in textbooks and current medical journals, an unfavorable reply was received from only one of the Medical Staffs. Subsequently, however, in a letter from the War Office in London, publication of the article was <b>recom-mended,</b> and later communications stated that the new therapy was accepted and widely used at the time in the British Armies...|$|E
