In 1956, French artist Andre Pignon visited Kupczynski in Warsaw and was appalled by the living and working conditions.

25|$|Banks are {{susceptible}} to many forms of risk which have triggered occasional systemic crises. These include liquidity risk (where many depositors may request withdrawals in excess of available funds), credit risk (the chance that those who owe money to the bank will not repay it), and interest rate risk (the possibility that the bank will become unprofitable, if <b>rising</b> <b>interest</b> rates force it to pay relatively more on its deposits than it receives on its loans).|$|E

According to some experts, the high processing fees involved in sending money to Africa are hampering African countries’ development.|$|E
25|$|Further {{adding to}} the {{financial}} pressure on the debt situation, in May 1994, Moody's downgraded Canada's debt, citing the high debt levels and concerns about a lack of political will {{to deal with the}} deficit. A vicious circle had been created. The underwhelming 1994 budget was taken as a sign that the Liberals were not serious about eliminating the deficit, which in turn created severe doubts amongst investors holding or considering buying government of Canada bonds that they would be repaid when the bonds matured. As a result, investors cease buying government of Canada bonds, which forced the Bank of Canada to raise the interest rates in order to attract buyers of Canada bonds. The <b>rising</b> <b>interest</b> rates, besides for hindering economic activity and thus hurting the government's ability to collect taxes, raised the costs of servicing the existing national debt, which in turn created further doubts amongst investors that they would be repaid, and thus started the circle all over again. As the vicious circle caused by the lack of investor confidence and <b>rising</b> <b>interest</b> rates continued into the fall of 1994, the 3% target became increasingly unlikely to be achieved, and thus Martin became more and more influenced by Dodge's advice that something more drastic needed to be done than achieving the 3% target.|$|E

25|$|The {{changing}} {{economic environment}} {{has a significant}} impact on banks and thrifts as they struggle to effectively manage their interest rate spread in the face of low rates on loans, rate competition for deposits and the general market changes, industry trends and economic fluctuations. It has been a challenge for banks to effectively set their growth strategies with the recent economic market. A <b>rising</b> <b>interest</b> rate environment may seem to help financial institutions, but the effect of the changes on consumers and businesses is not predictable and the challenge remains for banks to grow and effectively manage the spread to generate a return to their shareholders.|$|E
25|$|International Harvester never {{recovered}} from the strike. In November 1981, IH asked the UAW for $100 million in wage and benefit concessions. <b>Rising</b> <b>interest</b> rates, demand weakened by the early 1980s recession, and high manufacturing costs pushed the company's total debt to a whopping $4.5 billion. On December 23, 1981, the company reached an agreement with 200 of its lenders to refinance $4.15 billion of its debt {{in a bid to}} avoid bankruptcy. On January 20, 1982, the UAW rejected Harvester's request for concessions because McCardell had just given $6 million in bonuses to salaried employees. But with the firm's financial condition rapidly worsening, the UAW opened negotiations in March 1982. Negotiators reached a tentative agreement nearly two years to the day after the 19791980 strike ended, giving Harvester $200 million in wage, benefit, pension, and other savings over three years.|$|E

The combined total of $817,400,891 once trailed only the worldwide earnings of Jurassic Park as the highest of all time.

500|$|The Enlightenment European {{cultural}} movement had gained great influence in certain Commonwealth circles {{during the reign}} of its last king, Stanisław August Poniatowski (1764–95), which roughly coincided with the Enlightenment in Poland. In 1772, the First Partition of Poland, the earliest of the three successive 18th-century partitions of Commonwealth territory that eventually removed Poland from the map of Europe, shocked the inhabitants of the Commonwealth, and made it clear to progressive minds that the Commonwealth must either reform or perish. In the last three decades preceding the Great Sejm, there was a <b>rising</b> <b>interest</b> among progressive thinkers in constitutional reform. Even before the First Partition, a Polish noble, Michał Wielhorski, an envoy of the Bar Confederation, had been sent to ask the French philosophes Gabriel Bonnot de Mably and Jean-Jacques Rousseau to offer suggestions on a new constitution for a new Poland. Mably had submitted his recommendations (The Government and Laws of Poland) in 1770–1771; Rousseau had finished his Considerations on the Government of Poland in 1772, when the First Partition was already underway.

500|$|Unlike other Mega Man X titles, Maverick Hunter was a first-person shooter. The genre {{was chosen}} in {{response}} to the <b>rising</b> <b>interest</b> in first-person shooter games in the west. The gameplay would have adhered to core Mega Man X concepts; the ability to take and utilize the powers of enemies, his dash, and his X-Buster were all to be redesigned. His weapon designs were made to be more realistic than earlier Mega Man X titles. Instead of his arm transforming into a cannon, his armor transforms to create a gun. Additionally, his charged attack would launch a missile instead of launching a larger energy blast. Melee attacks would cause the game to switch to a third-person perspective for the attack. X's ability to steal abilities from others would have been expanded to allow the combination of abilities and the use of temporary weapons, such as bombs or tank turrets, from fallen enemies. The stolen abilities could also be used to exploit weaknesses in certain enemies. Platform elements such as his wall jump from the Mega Man X games would have been [...] "re-imagined in new ways." [...] The game was also planned to have branching paths and upgrades to find throughout.|$|E
