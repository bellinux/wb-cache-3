The resulting scheme {{is referred to as}} the differential space-time block code modulation for DS-CDMA (DSTBC-CDMA) systems. The new modulation and demodulation schemes are especially studied for the down-link transmission of DS-CDMA systems. We present three demodulation schemes, referred to as the differential space-time block code Rake (D-Rake) receiver, differential space-time block code deterministic (D-Det) receiver, and differential space-time block code deterministic de-prefix (D-Det-DP) receiver, respectively. The D-Det receiver exploits the known information of the spreading sequences and their delayed paths deterministically besides the <b>Rake</b> <b>type</b> combination; consequently, it can outperform the D-Rake receiver, which employs the <b>Rake</b> <b>type</b> combination only. The D-Det-DP receiver avoids the effect of intersymbol interference and hence can offer better performance than the D-Det receiver. </p...|$|E
40|$|Differential space-time {{modulation}} (DSTM) schemes {{were recently}} proposed to fully exploit the receive and transmit antenna diversities {{without the need}} for channel state information. DSTM is attractive in fast flat fading channels since accurate channel estimation is difficult to achieve. In this paper, we propose a new modulation scheme to improve the performance of DS-CDMA systems in fast time-dispersive fading channels, referred to as the differential space-time modulation for DS-CDMA (DST-CDMA). We present two new demodulation schemes, referred to as the differential space-time Rake receiver (DSTR) and differential space-time deterministic receiver (DSTD), respectively. DSTD exploits the known information of the spreading sequences and their delayed paths deterministically besides the <b>Rake</b> <b>type</b> combination. Consequently, it outperforms DSTR, which employs the <b>Rake</b> <b>type</b> combination only. The new modulation and demodulation schemes are especially suited for the fast fading down-link transmission in DS-CDMA systems employing multiple transmit antennas and one receive antenna...|$|E

5000|$|Outwardly, the New Orleans ships had a {{distinctive}} appearance and were considered very good-looking vessels, though the 1942-43 refits {{of the surviving}} ships changed the appearance substantially. The forward superstructure had the bridge wings cut back, {{and all of the}} large size windows were plated in with just a few port holes taking their place. The open bridge above the wheel house was enlarged by 100 percent by extending it forward. In addition several gun tubs were created for the 40 mm Bofors mounts both around the main mast, and aft. The forecastle deck extended back to the second funnel and the main superstructure was constructed without the ungainly tripod mast seen on the previous cruisers. The bow was a <b>raked</b> <b>type,</b> similar to those of British cruisers. The two funnels were situated closer together with a large search light tower in between. Aircraft handling facilities were moved further aft and a larger second conning station erected above the hangar. A single mainmast was erected there, between two huge pedestal cranes which handled both spotter planes and small craft. The main 8-inch turrets, although armored, were actually smaller with a more effective angular faceplate. By enlarging the forecastle deck, the secondary battery of 5-inch guns were mounted closer together, facilitating a more efficient ammunition delivery. Power was provided by eight Babcock & Wilcox high-pressure steam boilers that produced [...] for the four Westinghouse gearing steam turbines. The turbines were shafted to four screws, giving this class a rated speed of 33 kn. The cruisers' range - using 3269 LT of bunker oil - was approximately 14000 nmi km at 10 kn or 5280 nmi km at 20 kn. Their range could be extended by refueling from a tanker or another ship fitted to transfer oil while underway. The New Orleans cruisers performed peacetime exercises well with no serious shortcomings being found. While many changes were implemented to improve their performance and especially their protection, the 10,000-ton limit of the Washington Naval Treaty was not exceeded. The new cruisers were considered successful in their own right but could not be considered equal to some foreign contemporaries, which were often considerably larger.|$|R

Measurements were made at 1 GHz, 500 MHz, 90 MHz and 60 MHz, in three different environments – commercial, office and residential areas- representative of SUO/SAS scenarios. The characterization of the radio channel is provided through the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the relative received power and the errors in estimated distances based on the first and strongest paths extracted from the channel impulse responses (CIR). These results are {{used to evaluate the}} corresponding performance of a <b>RAKE</b> <b>type</b> receiver that can extract the first path and a traditional type receiver that locks onto the strongest signal.

40|$|Ash {{content of}} alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) hay {{typically}} ranges from 6 % to 8 % dry matter (DM) with ash contents > 8 % indicating hay {{that is likely}} contaminated with soil. The objective {{of this research was}} to determine the effect of rake-type on ash content of alfalfa hay. Research was conducted in 2015 in Minnesota (loamy sand), Pennsylvania (silty loam) and Wisconsin (silty loam) on first cutting alfalfa hay. Treatments involved consolidating two swaths of mowed hay with a wheel rake, side-delivery rake, rotary rake or a hay merger. To show changes in ash throughout haymaking, random samples were taken from the standing forage, cut swaths, windrows made by each <b>rake</b> <b>type</b> and from bales (Minnesota and Wisconsin) or haylage (Pennsylvania). Samples were analyzed for ash content using wet chemistry procedures. Statistical significance was set at P ≤ 0. 05 and mean separations were determined using Tukey HSD and are presented as percent DM. Differences in ash content were found between rakes at two locations with the wheel rake resulting in the greatest amount of ash and the merger resulting in the least amount of ash. Farmers looking to reduce ash content of hay should consider using a hay merger when combining swaths...|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{series that}} is used to calculate the probability of error for a BPSK modulated DS CDMA system with chip timing and carrier phase errors in a slowly fading, multipath channel is derived. The receiver is assumed to be a coherent <b>RAKE</b> receiver. Three <b>types</b> of diversity-schemes are considered: selection diversity, equal gain diversity combining and maximal ratio diversity combining. The error probability derivation does not resort to the widely used Gaussian approximation for the intersymbol interference and multiple access interference and is very accurate. The derived series for probability of error calculations is used to assess the reduction in the system capacity due to di#erent levels of synchronization errors. For all three diversity combining schemes considered, the degradation in the system performance is expressed as an e#ective reduction in the system processing gain. Systems of 1. 25 MHz, 5 MHz and 10 MHz are considered for di#erentnumberofdiversity branches and it is shown that the percentage reduction in the system capacity due to synchronization errors is approximately the same for all these systems...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, single-grit {{orthogonal}} cutting has been performed on a carbon steel with shaped CBN and diamond grains {{to understand the}} difference in surface quality and grinding force between CBN and diamond wheels. The cutting and thrust forces were measured by means of load washer under different negative rake angles, cutting speeds, and depths of cut. In each cutting condition, the thrust and cutting forces increased linearly with increasing cross sectional area of groove. Forces with diamond grains were greater in almost cases than the cutting with CBN grains, and much influenced by cutting condition. On the other hand, no significant influence except for rake angle was seen in forces in cutting with CBN grain. Furthermore, the friction angles under each cutting condition was calculated to detect the deformation condition in front of rake face at chip formation. It changed largely with grain <b>type,</b> <b>rake</b> angle and cutting speed. There was a quite difference between diamond and CBN grains. The reason for the difference would be the difference in coefficient of friction of two grain types...|$|R
40|$|Ultra-wideband (UWB) {{communication}} {{systems have been}} considered for future short-range wireless communications due {{to a number of}} advantages. However, the high multipath resolution of a conventional UWB system makes receiver design challenging. In particular, the huge number of resolvable paths of a multipath fading channel makes a <b>rake</b> receiver <b>type</b> architecture difficult due to the realization complexity and the problems arising from channel estimation. The transmitted-reference (TR) scheme has been proposed to ease this burden on the receiver for an impulse radio UWB system. However, despite the simplicity at first glance of the architecture of the TR-UWB system, practical implementation is challenging due to the difficulty of building an ultra-wideband delay element in a low power circuit. ^ In this dissertation, a new type of transmitted-reference ultra-wideband system is proposed. Rather than separating the data and reference signals by a time delay as in a standard TR-UWB system, the proposed scheme uses a slightly frequency-shifted reference (FSR) that is orthogonal to the data-bearing signal over the symbol interval. The proposed FSR-UWB system not only significantly simplifies the receiver design by successfully avoiding the delay element, but also outperforms the standard TR-UWB system in error performance. A multi-differential (MD) FSR-UWB system is also introduced in this dissertation, where multiple data carriers employ a common reference carrier. Compared to the original single-differential FSR-UWB system, this modification essentially increases the number of (differential) degrees of freedom available for signaling in the system with only a negligible increase in bandwidth. Moreover, a higher data rate and an improved error performance are also achieved. Finally, a multiple-access (MA) FSR-UWB system is introduced. It will be shown in this dissertation that the receiver of the proposed MA FSR-UWB system achieves processing gain but does not require knowledge of the spreading code of the user of interest. Therefore, an extremely simple receiver structure can be implemented by avoiding the need for a costly de-spreading circuitry. In addition, synchronization of the proposed schemes is discussed. It is shown that the FSR-UWB systems can realize synchronization without difficulty - even in a multiple access environment. ...|$|R

40|$|Georgette Heyer, {{a writer}} most famous for her Regency romances, has not entered the portals of any {{literary}} canon, yet her writing {{has had an}} impact on the literary world in terms of her contribution to popular fiction. The body of Scholarship on Georgette Heyer is not large and this thesis seeks to contribute to and extend previous research through an analysis of her heroes, in particular, the Regency hero. This investigation into her heroes reveals that Heyer was influenced by the heroes of both literary and popular writers and, in turn, helped to create a new genre of romantic hero. Georgette Heyer's two prototypes, 'Mark I: The brusque, savage sort with a foul temper' and 'Mark II: Suave, well-dressed, rich, and a famous whip', have their roots in literary tradition. A study of her novels reveals the heavy influence of pre-twentieth century writers, particularly Charlotte Br nte, Lord Byron, and Jane Austen, and the twentieth century works of Baroness Orczy. In the Regency novels, Heyer's heroes are suave, sophisticated men: Corinthians, top-sawyers, leaders of fashion - the type of archetypal hero one might expect in popular historical romance fiction. Indeed, Heyer's novels are of fundamental importance in the creation and popularising of this archetype. Georgette Heyer also redefines the romantic genre by introducing the <b>rake</b> as a <b>type</b> of anti-hero and subverting the heroic norm with dandified and plain men also playing the heroic role. Through Georgette Heyer's contribution to the Regency romance, the Heyer hero has become a recognised and frequently replicated type...|$|R
30|$|All {{analyses}} {{were carried out}} exemplarily for three large data sets from freshwater ecosystems focused on the monitoring of environmental impacts and restoration success. Each data set includes the taxonomic groups periphyton, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes and fishes. Data structure was partially different between taxonomic groups and data sets concerning quantitative or semiquantitative data, sampling methods, as well as number of sampled river stretches and treatments. Data set (1) was focused on a pairwise comparison of upstream and downstream sides of weirs in five different rivers (Mueller et al. 2011; periphyton: scraping from stones and sedimentation method, macrophytes: point abundance sampling with garden rake, macroinvertebrates: surber sampling, fishes: electrofishing), data set (2) was collected from lotic and lentic freshwater habitat types (river, oxbow, drainage ditch) before and after floodplain restoration at the German section of the Danube River (Stammel et al. 2012; periphyton: scraping from stones and sedimentation method, macrophytes: point abundance sampling with garden rake, macroinvertebrates: kick sampling, fishes: electrofishing) and data set (3) {{is focused on the}} effects of four substratum restoration treatments (substratum <b>raking,</b> two different <b>types</b> of gravel introduction, sickle-formed current constrictor) in three calciferous and three silicious rivers distributed throughout the German federal state Bavaria (Mueller et al. 2014; Pander et al. 2014; periphyton: scraping from stones and sedimentation method, macrophytes: visual plot assessment, macroinvertebrates: surber sampling, fishes: electrofishing). Details on the sampling methods, sampling design, sample numbers and numbers of species and individuals per data set are presented in Mueller et al. (2013).
