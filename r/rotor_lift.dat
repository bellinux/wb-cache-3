5000|$|The rotor now has {{substantial}} {{rotational energy}} {{due to the}} tip weights (usable temporary power equivalent to [...] ), and the rotor blades are pitched to push air down and lift the aircraft in a jump takeoff.While altitude is reached, the aircraft transitions into forward flight using the pusher propeller, and the rotor shifts to autorotation (windmilling) with air flowing up through the rotor.As speed increases, the air flow increases rotor RPM like other autogyros. Once sufficient airspeed is reached (around 70 - 85 mph) for the small wings to provide lift, rotor blades are feathered to reduce rotor speed to 100 RPM and minimize drag, and lift is provided mostly by the wings when speed reaches 150 mph. <b>Rotor</b> <b>lift</b> is reduced to 10%, and flight efficiency is somewhat below that of a commercial jet plane.|$|E

By comparing with the aerodynamic characteristics of ducted fan with a single rotor, results {{show that there is}} interference between the upper and lower rotors, the upper one interferes the lower one more heavily and interference is reduced with the increase of distance between the rotors; the duct of ducted fan with coaxial rotors can provide more lift than the one with a single rotor...|$|R

The XH- 59 A is a research helicopter with two coaxial rotors and hingeless blades. Performance, vibration, and noise at various forward speeds, <b>rotor</b> <b>lift</b> coefficients and rotor shaft angles of attack were investigated. The noise data were acquired over an isolated <b>rotor</b> <b>lift</b> coefficient range of 0. 024 to 0. 162, an advance ratio range of 0. 23 to 0. 45 corresponding to tunnel wind speeds of 89 to 160 knots, and angles of attack from 0 deg to 10 deg. Acoustic data are presented for seven microphone locations for all run conditions where the model noise is above the background noise. Model test configuration and performance information are also listed. Acoustic waveforms, dBA, and 1 / 3 -octave spectra as functions of operating condition for selected data points and microphones are presented.

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted in}} the Glenn L. Martin Wind Tunnel {{to determine the effect}} of blade planform variation on the forward-flight performance of four small-scale rotors. The rotors were 5. 417 ft in diameter and differed only in blade planform geometry. The four planforms were: (1) rectangular; (2) 3 : 1 linear taper starting at 94 percent radius; (3) 3 : 1 linear taper starting at 75 percent radius; and (4) 3 : 1 linear taper starting at 50 percent radius. Each planform had a thrust-weighted solidity of 0. 098. The investigation included forward-flight simulation at advance ratios from 0. 14 to 0. 43 for a range of <b>rotor</b> <b>lift</b> and drag coefficients. Among the four rotors, the rectangular rotor required the highest torque for the entire range of rotor drag coefficients attained at advanced ratios greater than 0. 14 for <b>rotor</b> <b>lift</b> coefficients C sub L from 0. 004 to 0. 007. Among the rotors with tapered blades and for C sub L = 0. 004 to 0. 007, either the 75 percent tapered rotor or the 50 percent tapered rotor required the least amount of torque for the full range of rotor drag coefficients attained at each advance ratio. The performance of the 94 percent tapered rotor was generally between that of the rectangular rotor and the 75 and 50 percent tapered rotors at each advance ratio for this range of <b>rotor</b> <b>lift</b> coefficients...|$|E

40|$|A new rotor {{configuration}} {{called the}} variable camber rotor was investigated numerically for {{its potential to}} reduce helicopter control loads and improve hover performance. This rotor differs from a conventional rotor in that it incorporates a deflectable 50 % chord trailing edge flap to control <b>rotor</b> <b>lift,</b> and a non-feathering (fixed) forward portion. Lift control is achieved by linking the blade flap to a conventional swashplate mechanism; therefore, it is pilot action to the flap deflection that controls <b>rotor</b> <b>lift</b> and tip path plane tilt. This report presents the aerodynamic characteristics of the flapped and unflapped airfoils, evaluations of aerodynamics techniques to minimize flap hinge moment, comparative hover rotor performance and the physical concepts of the blade motion and rotor control.
