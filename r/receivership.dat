5|$|After {{holding the}} two Michelin stars until 1988, and then losing its single star in 1991, in 1992 the {{restaurant}} went into <b>receivership</b> and {{was purchased by}} Helen Avis. Under chef Thierry LePratre-Granet, the restaurant was restored to a single Michelin star in 1996.

40|$|In {{a recent}} article, we {{presented}} a historical {{analysis of the}} regime of double liability for bank shareholders {{that existed in the}} United States between the Civil War and the Great Depression. Under this regime of double liability, if a bank failed, a receiver would be appointed {{to determine the extent to}} which the bank 2 ̆ 7 s liabilities exceeded its assets. Shareholders would then be required to pay an amount up to and including the par value of their stock to satisfy the outstanding claims. Under current law, the regime of limited liability that existed for about seventy-five years has now been replaced by a more traditional corporate law paradigm in which shareholders 2 ̆ 7 risks are capped at the amount of their initial capital investment. Moreover, the protections for depositors once provided by the regime of double liability have now been replaced by a federally sponsored program of deposit insurance. In a new and more complete study of national bank <b>receiverships</b> during the 1930 - 34 period, Professor Howell Jackson examines data for 1, 595 national banks. Professor Jackson includes additional observations in his data set and extended the period of his inquiry concerning <b>receiverships.</b> While we stopped with <b>receiverships</b> that were completed by October 31, 1937, Professor Jackson uses <b>receiverships</b> that were completed as late as October 31, 1941. Thus, while Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s analysis covers the same 1930 - 34 period that we covered, his study includes <b>receiverships</b> that took far longer to complete than the <b>receiverships</b> we examined in our study...|$|R

5|$|Iceland's {{financial}} position has steadily improved since the crash. The economic contraction and rise in unemployment {{appear to have}} been arrested by late 2010 and with growth under way in mid-2011. Three main factors have been important in this regard.

The Financial Supervisory Authority of Iceland used permission granted by the emergency legislation to take over the domestic operations of the three largest banks.
