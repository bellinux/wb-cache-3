40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the indications <b>for</b> <b>Evisceration,</b> Enucleation and Exentration in patients operated at the eye department. Design: It was a prospective study done at Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, from May 2001 to October 2003. Results: A total of 110 cases comprising of 50 enucleations, 34 evisceration, and 26 exentration were seen. Ocular malignancy was the commonest cause for eneucleation while postoperative panophthalmitis and trauma were the reasons <b>for</b> <b>evisceration</b> and <b>for</b> exentration the indication was {{squamous cell carcinoma}} involving lid and conjunctiva followed by basal cell carcinoma. Conclusions: Only a minority of cases of eye globe surgery are preventable and /or treatable, while rest are due to malignancy. Early diagnosis in these cases is likely to make surgery easy with promising postoperative cure...|$|R
40|$|A 30 -year-old male, who {{underwent}} previous pars plana vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade due to endogenous endophthalmitis originated from Klebsiella liver abscess, was referred <b>for</b> <b>evisceration.</b> At 2 months after vitrectomy with silicon oil tamponade, conjunctival chemosis and ocular pain were aggravated. Diffuse eyelid swelling and large subconjunctival mass with lipid droplets were noted. On MRI examination, subconjunctival mass and intra- and extraconal orbital mass around {{superior rectus muscle}} were observed. Excision of subconjunctival and orbital mass was performed. Histopathologic examination showed multiple silicone oil vacuoles surrounded by foreign body giant cells and fibrosis, which confirmed silicone oil granuloma. In a patient with suspicious melting sclera in diseases such as endophthalmitis, large silicone oil granuloma may be complicated in a rapid fashion after intravitreal silicone oil tamponade due to silicone oil leakage...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSolar {{water heating}} systems have proven {{reliable}} and economical. In Taiwan, the cumulative area of installed solar collectors {{at the end}} of 2014 was approximately 2. 39 millionm 2 and approximately 98 % of those systems were installed in the domestic sector. Preheating water for livestock processing plants is cost-effective since heated water can be used <b>for</b> <b>evisceration,</b> sanitation during processing and for daily cleanup of plant. In this case study, detailed measurements are reported for parallel combined solar thermal and heat pump systems that are installed in a livestock processing plant. These results confirm that the hot water consumption, the mass flow rate and the operation of circulation and heat pumps affect the system's thermal efficiency. The combined operational effect is a factor in system design. The estimated payback period is less than the expected service period of the system, which validates the financial viability...|$|R
