The Costa Internal, by contrast, is crossed by perennial <b>rivers</b> <b>that</b> may flood during the rainy season, sometimes forming swamps.|$|R

5|$|After Lee's death, {{his wife}} Emma {{continued}} {{to operate the}} ferry for two years, in 1878 establishing an alternative ferry route below {{the confluence of the}} Paria <b>River</b> <b>that</b> allowed travelers to avoid the infamous Lee's Backbone segment. However, this route could not be used in the summer months due to dangerous high water levels from snowmelt. In 1879, the LDS Church bought the ferry and transferred its operation to Warren Marshall Johnson and his family. In 1896 the ferry was transferred to Jim Emett, who installed a cable across the Colorado River {{to reduce the risk of}} boats washing downstream during high water.|$|E

The Battle of Chusto-Talasah {{took place on the}} north side of Tulsa and a number of battles and skirmishes took place in nearby counties. After the War, the tribes signed Reconstruction {{treaties}} with the federal government that in some cases required substantial land concessions.

There are public footpaths alongside many stretches of the river. There are also areas of the <b>river</b> <b>that</b> serve as desirable spots for wild swimming.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Europeans began {{settling}} the land {{east of the}} Mississippi <b>River</b> <b>that</b> was inhabited by the Chickasaw Indians for centuries prior {{to the arrival of}} Europeans. Chickasaw land in West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky was ceded in the Jackson Purchase after negotiations in which the United States was represented by General Andrew Jackson and Governor Isaac Shelby, while the Chickasaw were represented by their chiefs and warriors. In 1818, both sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa. In the treaty, the United States agreed to pay the Chickasaw $300,000 in return for the right to the land east of the Mississippi River and north of the Mississippi state line.|$|E

5|$|I-70 {{exits the}} valley through De Beque Canyon, a path carved by the Colorado <b>River</b> <b>that</b> {{separates}} the Book Cliffs from Battlement Mesa. The river {{and its tributaries}} provide the course for the ascent up the Rocky Mountains. In the canyon, I-70 enters the Beavertail Mountain Tunnel, {{the first of several}} tunnels built to route the freeway across the Rockies. This tunnel design features a curved sidewall, unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side-walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle.|$|E

5|$|In 1794 a state road, Genesee Road, {{was built}} from Utica {{west to the}} Genesee <b>River.</b> <b>That</b> year a {{contract}} was awarded to the Mohawk Turnpike and Bridge Company to extend the road northeast to Albany, and in 1798 it was extended. The Seneca Turnpike was key to Utica's development, replacing a worn footpath with a paved road. The village became a rest and supply area along the Mohawk River for goods and the many people moving through Western New York {{to and from the}} Great Lakes.|$|E
5|$|In Allegan County, I-196/US31 {{passes a}} pair of golf courses and {{continues}} northward through farm fields. Near the community of Glenn, A-2 crosses over the freeway and runs parallel to it on the east. The two roads trade places again when I-196/US31 turns northeasterly {{on the south side}} of the twin cities of Saugatuck and Douglas. The freeway crosses over a section of Kalamazoo Lake, a wider section of the Kalamazoo <b>River</b> <b>that</b> flows between the two towns. A-2 crosses back to the eastern side of the freeway north of Saugatuck, and I-196/US31 continues north-northeasterly toward Holland.|$|E
5|$|In April 1784, the Rowans {{and five}} other {{families}} set out for a tract of land on the Long Falls of the Green <b>River</b> <b>that</b> Rowan had purchased before leaving Pennsylvania.

The fort, then located approximately 100 {{miles from the nearest}} white settlement, is the present-day town of Calhoun. The settlers at Fort Vienna frequently clashed with the Shawnee who used the area as a hunting ground. The Rowans would remain at Fort Vienna for six years.|$|E
