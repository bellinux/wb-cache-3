50|$|The {{organization}} currently employs 100 people, mainly engineering {{graduates and}} doctors. It {{was founded in}} 1987 for research purposes. In 2007, Ascamm had a turnover of 7.3 Million euros. More than 60% of income is from direct innovation services to Small and medium enterprises. The facilities of the technology centre have 6000 m² of built space with top-level laboratories and equipment: injection molding machines, machines for microprocessing, pressure die casting machines, materials laboratory, laser sintering and incremental sheet forming stations, comprehensive CAD/CAM/CAE workstations, complete metalworking workshops and mechatronics.In the ASCAMM sphere, 3 technology-based spin-off companies have been created: Neosurgery and Hexascreen, oriented to biomedical engineering applications, and Plastiasite, related to knowledge engineering innovative applications.ASCAMM participates actively as <b>RTD</b> <b>performer</b> in the Seventh Framework Programme of the European Union. Likewise, the Center also participates in local (Catalan and Spanish) public funding initiatives.|$|E

Working memory (WM) evoked by linguistic cues for spatial and nonspatial {{aspects of a}} visual scene was investigated by correlating fMRI BOLD signal (or Factivation_) with reaction times (RTs). Subjects {{were asked to indicate}} either the relative positions or ages of people or objects (referenced by the personal pronouns ‘‘he/she/it’’) in a previously shown image. Good performers of a particular task showed shorter <b>RTs</b> than poor <b>performers.</b> Task-specific activation that is greater in good performers than poor ones is taken to indicate involvement of a given region in performance of the task. Our results indicate that dorsoposterior precuneus supports spatial WM during linguistic processing while a network of areas including the caudate support nonspatial WM in categorization of age. We argue that within-subjects variation of RTs across trials reflects effort. Good performers have higher activity in precuneus as a function of effort compared to poo...|$|R
