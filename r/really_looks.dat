The figures are of superhuman {{dimension}} and, {{in the case}} of Adam, of such beauty that according to the biographer Vasari, it <b>really</b> <b>looks</b> as if God himself had designed the figure, rather than Michelangelo. But despite the beauty of the individual figures, Michelangelo has not glorified the human state, and he certainly has not presented the Humanist ideal of platonic love. In fact, the ancestors of Christ, which he painted around the upper section of the wall, demonstrate all the worst aspects of family relationships, displaying dysfunction in as many different forms as there are families.|$|E

500|$|Jedi Knights {{graphics}} received mixed reviews. Critics {{stated the}} non-3D accelerated {{version of the}} game looks poor. Game Revolution's Calvin Hubble argued that the game only <b>really</b> <b>looks</b> good if played on a system with a powerful 3D card. Other graphical aspects received praise. The character animations were considered more detailed than similar games. The graphical presentation of the levels received specific praise from IGN: [...] "No other first person shooter has come close to Jedi Knights dizzying sense of scale and its vast levels." [...] The full-motion video sequences between levels received both praise and criticism.|$|E
500|$|The {{early months}} of 1706 also proved {{frustrating}} for the Duke as Louis XIV's generals gained early successes in Italy and Alsace. These setbacks thwarted Marlborough's original plans for the coming campaign, but he soon adjusted his schemes and marched into enemy territory. LouisXIV, equally determined to fight and avenge Blenheim, goaded his commander, Marshal Villeroi, to seek out Monsieur Marlbrouck. The subsequent Battle of Ramillies, fought in the Spanish Netherlands on 23 May, was perhaps Marlborough's most successful action, and {{one in which he}} had himself characteristically drawn his sword at the pivotal moment. For the loss of fewer than 3,000 dead and wounded (far fewer than Blenheim), his victory had cost the enemy some 20,000 casualties, inflicting in the words of Marshal Villars, [...] "the most shameful, humiliating and disastrous of routs". The campaign was an unsurpassed operational triumph for the English general. Town after town subsequently fell to the Allies. [...] "It <b>really</b> <b>looks</b> more like a dream than truth", wrote Marlborough to Sarah. With Prince Eugene's rout of the French army at Turin in September, 1706 proved a miraculous year for Allied arms.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Orloff, the Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor of Zoic Studios, {{considered}} the creature {{one of the}} most challenging effects his company helped make for the season. He explained that this and other designed monsters are [...] "really super fantastical, they’re really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so wild and crazy, that it really takes a lot to make it look real in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things – to get the audience to believe in it is kind of the biggest challenge we’ve faced on the show so far." [...] During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a [...] "were-upine" [...] or [...] "porcuman". Lance Reddick commented on set, [...] "When I first got here tonight, I was expecting zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature looks so bizarre, I mean it <b>really</b> <b>looks</b> like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with." [...] The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E

500|$|Determined {{not to use}} any big Hollywood names, King {{looked at}} many European actors before {{settling}} on British actor Rupert Friend. They were aware of him from the 2005 film Pride & Prejudice. Vallée noted, [...] "I had an image of Albert in my mind, before we cast Rupert, and how the actor might play him and when Rupert came on board he was just right. He {{had a very good}} understanding of the character and he did a lot of research to get him right, with the accent and his deportment. He <b>really</b> <b>looks</b> the part, he looks so romantic!" [...] Co-producer Dennis O'Sullivan called Friend [...] "our Scarlett O'Hara search". They believed the actor had the most chemistry with Blunt after selecting several to play chess with her. Friend's height (6ft 1in) also played a factor in their choice. Friend believed [...] "Albert was a true unsung hero. A great reformer, a doting husband and father, a hard worker and man of real integrity and modesty." [...] The actor also thought their relationship was not [...] "a gooey love story"; rather, their arguments showed it [...] "wasn't an easy road by any means". Friend strove to immerse himself in the role, and learned the prince's particular characteristics, such as the way he rode a horse, walked, and played the piano. He worked with a voice coach and German instructor to perfect his accent, with the intention of [...] "put in as much German as possible, because Victoria and Albert did speak German to each other." ...|$|E

[...] University of San Francisco law professor Robert Talbot said the videos could support a claim of an accidental shooting: [...] "Nothing about his body looks murderous." [...] Attorney Harland Braun, who won acquittal for an officer in the Rodney King beating, noted that video evidence can be deceptive.

But she's {{in such a state}} that she misses the funeral." [...] Texas is a [...] "complete wreck" [...] and after she is thrown out of Chez Chez nightclub, Silas finds her and takes her to the woods. Hendrickse-Spendlove said that [...] "It <b>really</b> <b>looks</b> like she's about to meet the same horrible fate as her sister". Silas eventually decides not to kill Texas.|$|E

2500|$|Changes {{in cover}} art {{throughout}} the years has reflected the change in attitudes towards gay people, according to the author. The original cover illustration showed Annie, in a black cloak, and Liza, standing away from Annie, on the Esplanade in Brooklyn overlooking the harbor. Garden commented that [...] "it <b>really</b> <b>looks</b> as if Annie is going to swoop down on Liza—almost like a vampire attacking". Although this cover was never used, future covers failed to show the girls relating, Garden said. Garden's preferred cover art, which came out in 1992 and has been reused in more recent publications, shows [...] "the two girls really relating to each other equally," [...] Garden said.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{returning}} in 1994, Lionel was {{paired with}} popular character Kirsty Knight (Angela Dotchin). Several {{people involved in}} production were skeptical that the [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] storyline could actually work, finding it unlikely the glamorous Kirsty would be attracted to the clumsy Lionel. However the unusual pairing was a hit with audiences, {{becoming part of the}} classic soap opera archetype of; the couple the audience know should be together even when the characters do not know it themselves. The couple were so successful a novel was released telling the two's story titled [...] "Kirsty and Lionel - Shortland Street Books". The characters first began to share scenes when Kirsty was involved in a car crash that saw the deaths of TP Aleni (Elizabeth Skeen) and Steve Mills (Andrew Binns). Kirsty used Lionel as a shoulder to cry on and though Lionel was instantly smitten, Kirsty was not. Dotchin explained, [...] "He's somebody who <b>really</b> <b>looks</b> after her, but it's not a blossoming romance. Lionel's not Kirsty's type, she doesn't see them together as a couple sexually. He's very much in love with her, but she's not in love with him." [...] Nonetheless, several months later the two featured {{in one of the most}} iconic moments in the soap's history when the first ever cliffhanger featured on the soap centered around the wedding between the two being interrupted by Kirsty's past lover Stuart Neilson (Martin Henderson). The two got through the hiccup but after Kirsty was hit by a truck in another of the soap's iconic storylines, leaving her with amnesia, she forgot ever loving Lionel and returned to ex-boyfriend Greg (Tim Balme). However the two reconciled and the 1996 season ended on their kiss. The two's reconciliation did not last long and the two were amidst divorcing when the plane they were in crashed in the 1997 cliffhanger. However, in 1998 Lionel finally decided he wanted to be with Kirsty, only to miss her by seconds when she left to live in Wellington.|$|E
2500|$|For the reboot film, Guillermo del Toro {{said his}} Frankenstein {{would be a}} {{faithful}} [...] "Miltonian tragedy", citing Frank Darabont's [...] "near perfect" [...] script, which evolved into Kenneth Branagh's Frankenstein. Del Toro said of his vision, [...] "What I'm {{trying to do is}} take the myth and do something with it, but combining elements of Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein without making it just a classical myth of the monster. The best moments in my mind of Frankenstein, of the novel, are yet to be filmed ... The only guy that has ever nailed for me the emptiness, not the tragic, not the Miltonian dimension of the monster, but the emptiness is Christopher Lee in the Hammer films, where he <b>really</b> <b>looks</b> like something obscenely alive. Boris Karloff has the tragedy element nailed down {{but there are so many}} versions, including that great screenplay by Frank Darabont that was ultimately not really filmed." [...] He has also cited Bernie Wrightson's illustrations as inspiration, and said the film will not focus on the monster's creation, but be an adventure film featuring the character. Del Toro said he would like Wrightson to design his version of the creature. The film will also focus on the religious aspects of Shelley's tale. In June 2009, del Toro stated that production on Frankenstein was not likely to begin for at least four years. [...] Despite this, he has already cast frequent collaborator Doug Jones in the role of Frankenstein's monster. [...] In an interview with Sci Fi Wire, Jones stated that he learned of the news the same day as everybody else; that [...] "Guillermo did say to the press that he’s already cast me as his monster, but we’ve yet to talk about it. But in his mind, if that’s what he’s decided, then it's done ... It would be a dream come true." [...] The film will be a period piece. It is unclear what stage of development this film is in.|$|E

2500|$|In England that {{familiar}} style known as Elizabethan and Jacobean prevailed throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. At {{the present time}} hardly {{a home in the}} land has not its old oak chest carved with the familiar half circle or scroll border along the top rail, or the arch pattern on the panels. The court cupboards, with their solid or open under parts and upper cornice supported by turned balusters of extravagant thickness, are to be seen wherever one goes. And chairs, real as well as spurious, with solid backs carved in the usual flat relief, are bought up with an avidity inseparable from fashion. Four-post bedsteads are harder to come by. The back is usually broken up into small panels and carved, the best effect being seen in those examples where the paneling or the framework only is decorated. The dining-hall tables often had six legs of great substance, which were turned somewhat after the shape of a covered cup, and were carved with foliage bearing a distant resemblance to the acanthus. Rooms were generally panelled with oak, sometimes divided at intervals by flat pilasters and the upper frieze carved with scroll work or dolphins. But the feature which distinguished the period was the fire mantle. It always must be the principal object in a room, and the Elizabethan carver fully appreciated this fact. By carving the chimney breast as a rule to the ceiling and covering the surrounding walls with more or less plain paneling, the designer, by thus concentrating the attention on one point, often produced results of a high order. Caryatid figures, pilasters and friezes were among the customary details employed to produce good effects. No finer example exists than that lately removed from the old palace at Bromley-by-Bow to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The mantelshelf is [...] from the ground and consists of a deep quadrant mould decorated with flat scroll work of good design. The supporting pilasters on either side are shaped and moulded in the customary Jacobean manner and are crowned by busts with Ionic capitals on the heads. Above the shelf the large center panel is deeply carved with the royal coat of arms with supporters and mantling, and on either side a semicircular arched niche contains a figure in classic dress. The Elizabethan carver often produced splendid staircases, sometimes carving the newel posts with heraldic figures bearing coats of arms, etc. The newels of a staircase at Highgate support different types of Cromwellian soldiers, carved with great vivacity and life. But in spite of excellent work, as for example the beautiful gallery at Hatfield, the carving of this period did not, so far as England was concerned, compare with other epochs, or with contemporary work in other parts of Europe. Much of the work is badly drawn and badly executed. It is true that good decorative effects were constantly obtained at the very minimum of cost, {{but it is difficult to}} discover much merit in work which <b>really</b> <b>looks</b> best when badly cut.|$|E
