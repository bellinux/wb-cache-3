50|$|As one of {{the most}} charismatic and outspoken of <b>Rastafarian</b> leaders, Howell was incarcerated at notably higher rates than other pioneers of the Rastafrian movement, such as Joseph Nathaniel Hibbert and Hinds. Described as “the most persecuted <b>Rastafarian</b> to date,” Howell {{suffered}} considerably under constant state surveillance because of his <b>Rastafarian</b> teachings. Due to his repeated imprisonment and persecution, he suffered the blow of being absent during Haile Selassie’s 1966 visit to Jamaica.|$|R
50|$|Some {{researchers}} (Horace Campbell) {{associate the}} origin of the dreadlocks of the <b>Rastafarian</b> movement with those of the Kikuyu freedom fighters who were branded Mau Mau by the colonial authorities. Jamaican <b>Rastafarian</b> symbols such as the name Ras Tafari, the Lion of Judah and the green, yellow and red flag are derived from Ethiopia, which borders Kenya to the north. The Nyabinghi section of the <b>Rastafarian</b> movement derives its name from the Uganda and Rwandese regions west of Kenya.|$|R

5000|$|Livity is the <b>Rastafarian</b> {{concept of}} righteous, everliving living. Its essence is the {{realization}} that an energy or life-force, conferred by Almighty Jah (God), exists within, and flows through, all people and all living things. This energy {{is the presence of}} Jah living within us, and is often expressed in <b>Rastafarian</b> vocabulary as [...] "I and I", where the first [...] "I" [...] refers to the Almighty, the second [...] "I" [...] for oneself. A primary goal in <b>Rastafarian</b> meditation is maintaining awareness of I and I.|$|R
25|$|Hills {{also became}} an {{advocate}} for Jamaica's Rastafari movement, who were being oppressed in the late fifties. He gave <b>Rastafarians</b> jobs as woodcarvers, free paints to poor artists, such as the now-famed Ras Dizzy and bailed them out of Spanish Town Prison while encouraging rasta brethren to sustain themselves through art and music. Christopher and Norah Hills were personally thanked for their years of support for struggling rastas by Mortimo Planno, the Rasta teacher of Bob Marley {{and one of the}} few Rastafarian elders to have met with Emperor Haile Selassie in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rastafarians</b> {{often make}} use of the colours red, black, and green, which were {{previously}} the colours of the Garvey movement; Garvey in turn had adopted them from the Ethiopian flag. According to Garvey, the red symbolises the blood of martyrs, the black symbolises the skin of Africans, and the green represents the vegetation of the land. Many Rastas also include the colour gold alongside these previous three, which has been adopted from the flag of Jamaica. Displaying these colours on their clothing marks Rastas out from non-Rastas and allows adherents to recognise their co-religionists.|$|E

Few claimed firefighters were unable to wear their helmets or poperly seal their safety helmets due to over-long hair. However, on June 21, 2001, Judge James Robertson of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia imposed a temporary injunction against the department, preventing it from applying the short-hair policy to those individuals (such as <b>Rastafarians</b> or Muslims) who wore long hair or beards for religious purposes. Judge Robertson's ruling only delayed a final disposition regarding the policy, however, and appeals were made.|$|E

[...] In a review of the second season, Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said [...] "Dancin' Homer" [...] felt [...] "a bit flat", but [...] "even in [...] lowest points, humor is easy to find." [...] Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought the best line of the episode was Homer's [...] "Marge, this ticket doesn't just give me a seat. It also gives me the right— no, the duty— to make a complete ass of myself." [...] Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said lines from the episode such as [...] "A Simpson on a T-shirt, I never thought I'd see the day" [...] show a [...] "humorous self-awareness of the emergence of The Simpsons as cultural phenomenon".|$|E
