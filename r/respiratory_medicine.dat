40|$|Objectives: To {{analyze the}} {{pharmacological}} management of respiratory tract infections in hospitalized pediatric patients. The economic {{burden of the}} disease and the adverse drug reactions occurring during the course of treatment have also been studied. Materials and Methods: It was a prospective, longitudinal, and observational study, carried out over a period of one-and-a-half years. The patients, aged one month to twelve years, diagnosed with respiratory tract infections (RTI), as confirmed by a pediatrician, were enrolled. Modified Kunin's criteria along with the guidelines set by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) were followed for assessing the appropriateness of the antibacterials prescribed. The adverse drug reactions occurring {{during the course of the}} treatment were noted and the economic burden of the disease was calculated as direct and indirect costs. Results: A total of 201 patients were enrolled, of whom 46 % were in the age group of one month to one year. The most common diagnosis was pneumonia (76 %). The number of drugs and antibacterials prescribed per patient were 4. 88 ± 1. 57 and 1. 85 ± 0. 86, respectively. Antibacterials (37. 7 %), intravenous fluids (17. 2 %), <b>respiratory</b> <b>medicines</b> (16. 6 %), and analgesic/antipyretics (16. 5 %) were the common drug groups prescribed. Among the antibacterials, amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (47 %) and cefotaxime (22 %) were frequently prescribed. Appropriate antibacterial therapy was given in 42 % of the cases. Salbutamol and a combination of Levosalbutamol and Ipratropium Bromide were the commonly prescribed <b>respiratory</b> <b>medicines.</b> Three adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were observed in indoor patients, all due to antibacterials. The economic burden of the disease was calculated to be Rs. 4925. 14 or US$ 109. 9 per patient. Conclusion: An overuse of antibacterials and <b>respiratory</b> <b>medicines</b> was seen in the study. Emphasis on proper diagnosis and treatment, education and availability of locally effective guidelines may help in a better and judicious use of drugs in children...|$|R
40|$|Background Increasing {{access to}} {{essential}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>medicines</b> and influenza vaccination {{has been a}} priority for over three decades. Their use remains low in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where {{little is known about}} factors influencing use, or about the use of influenza vaccination for preventing respiratory exacerbations. Methods We estimated rates of regular use of bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids and influenza vaccine, and predictors for use among 19 000 adults in 23 high-income countries (HICs) and LMIC sites. Results Bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids and influenza vaccine were used significantly more in HICs than in LMICs, after adjusting for similar clinical needs. Although they are used more commonly by people with symptomatic or severe respiratory disease, the gap between HICs and LMICs is not explained by the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or doctor-diagnosed asthma. Site-specific factors are likely to influence use differently. The gross national income per capita for the country is a strong predictor for use of these treatments, suggesting that economics influence under-treatment. Conclusion We still need a better understanding of determinants for the low use of essential <b>respiratory</b> <b>medicines</b> and influenza vaccine in low-income settings. Identifying and addressing these more systematically could improve the access and use of effective treatments. </...|$|R

Objectives: To evaluate the effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of umeclidinium and umeclidinium/vilanterol. Methods: Nine patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) and nine matched healthy volunteers received a single dose of umeclidinium 125 µg; and after a 7 - to 14 -day washout, a single dose of umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 / 25 µg. Results: No clinically relevant increases in plasma umeclidinium or vilanterol systemic exposure (area under the curve or maximum observed plasma concentration) were observed following umeclidinium 125 µg or umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 / 25 µg administration. On average, the amount of umeclidinium excreted in 24 hours in urine (90 % confidence interval) was 88 % (81 %– 93 %) and 89 % (81 %– 93 %) lower in patients with severe renal impairment compared with healthy volunteers following umeclidinium 125 µg and umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 / 25 µg administration, respectively. Treatments were well tolerated in both populations. Conclusion: Umeclidinium 125 µg or umeclidinium/vilanterol 125 / 25 µg administration to patients with severe renal impairment did not demonstrate clinically relevant increases in systemic exposure compared with healthy volunteers. No dose adjustment for umeclidinium and umeclidinium/vilanterol is warranted in patients with severe renal impairment.

40|$|NOTE: This is a History of Medicine {{submission}} {{and does}} not have an abstract. As such the Introduction section has been pasted here as an "abstract". &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a condition characterized by repeated occlusion of the upper airway (UA) during sleep. From OSA’s initial clinical description less than 50 years ago to present day, progression in <b>respiratory</b> sleep <b>medicine</b> has vastly expanded the scope of our knowledge of OSA. What was once regarded as a rare affliction that simply led to daytime hypersomnelence 1 is now recognized as a common and serious condition capable wreaking havoc in the cardiovascular system, independently promoting heart failure, stroke, hypertension and likely atherosclerosis. At {{the beginning of a new}} decade, the field of OSA research finds itself at yet another frontier as a radically new etiological perspective emerges. This new paradigm of the cause of OSA promises the possibility of novel OSA treatments and prophylaxes.

40|$|Objectives: We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} if beliefs about treatment, clinical factors {{and quality of life}} predicted adherence to treatment in patients with bronchiectasis. Methods: We recruited participants with confirmed bronchiectasis to a one-year study. We calculated adherence to treatment using medication possession ratios and self-report. Baseline Beliefs about Medicines, clinical, demographic and Quality of Life Questionnaire- Bronchiectasis data were collected. We used logistic regression to determine predictors of adherence to treatment during the subsequent year. Results: Seventy-five participants were recruited. Beliefs about harm, age and total number of prescribed medications were predictors of adherence to inhaled antibiotics. Concerns about medication, age and Quality of Life Questionnaire-Bronchiectasis Treatment Burden were predictors of adherence to other <b>respiratory</b> <b>medicines.</b> Beliefs about necessity of airway clearance and age were predictors of adherence to airway clearance. Conclusion: Beliefs about treatment, age, number of prescribed medications and perceived treatment burden predicted subsequent adherence in bronchiectasis, thereby, providing potential targets for future interventions in this population. Clinicians can use these data to identify patients with bronchiectasis who might be at risk of non-adherence i. e. those who are younger, have concerns about medications, who do not think airway clearance is necessary or who are prescribed numerous medications...|$|R
40|$|Mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} (MAPK) {{phosphatase}} 1 (MKP- 1) is a protein with anti-inflammatory properties and the archetypal {{member of the}} dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) family that have emerged {{over the past decade}} as playing an instrumental role in the regulation of airway inflammation. Not only does MKP- 1 serve a critical role as a negative feedback effector, controlling the extent and duration of pro-inflammatory MAPK signalling in airway cells, upregulation of this endogenous phosphatase has also emerged as being one of the key cellular mechanism responsible for the beneficial actions of clinically-used <b>respiratory</b> <b>medicines,</b> including beta(2) -agonists, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and corticosteroids.

40|$|Background. In {{the absence}} of {{standard}} pediatric prescribing information, clinicians often use medicines in an off-label way. Many studies have been published across the globe reporting different rates of off-label use. There is currently no study based on Indian drug formulary. Methods. The prospective observational study included pediatric patients in ages between 0 and 12 years admitted in a tertiary care hospital. Off-label use was assessed using the National Formulary of India (NFI). Predictors of off-label use were determined by logistic regression. Results. Of the 1645 medications prescribed, 1152 (70 %) were off-label based on 14 possible off-label categories. Off-label medicines were mainly due to dose difference and use in restricted age limits as indicated in NFI. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>medicines</b> (82 %), anti-infectives (73 %), and nervous system medicines (53 %) had higher off-label use. Important predictors of off-label prescribing were pediatric patients in age of 0 to 2 years (OR 1. 68, 95 % CI; P< 0. 001) and hospital stay of six to 10 days (OR 1. 91, 95 % CI; P< 0. 001).

40|$|This European Respiratory Society {{task force}} has {{reviewed}} {{the evidence for}} paediatric <b>medicines</b> in <b>respiratory</b> disease occurring in adults and children. We describe off-licence use, research priorities and ongoing studies. Off-licence and off-label prescribing in children is widespread and potentially harmful. Research areas in asthma include novel formulations and regimens, and individualised prescribing. In cystic fibrosis, future studies will focus on screened infants and robust outcome measures are needed. Other areas include new enzyme and antibiotic formulations and the basic defect. Research into pneumonia should include evaluation of new antibacterials and regimens, rapid diagnostic tests and, in pleural infection, antibiotic penetration, fibrinolytics and surveillance.
