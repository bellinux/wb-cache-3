500|$|Harding's vague oratory irritated some; McAdoo {{described}} a typical Harding speech as [...] "an army of pompous phrases moving over {{the landscape in}} search of an idea. Sometimes these meandering words actually capture a straggling thought and bear it triumphantly, a prisoner in their midst, until it died of servitude and over work." [...] H. L. Mencken concurred, [...] "it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of a string of wet sponges, it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of tattered washing on the line; it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of stale bean soup, of college yells, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights. It is so bad that a kind of grandeur creeps into it. It drags itself out of the dark abysm... of pish, and crawls insanely up the topmost pinnacle of tosh. It is rumble and bumble. It is balder and dash." [...] The New York Times took a more positive view of Harding's speeches, stating that in them the majority of people could find [...] "a reflection of their own indeterminate thoughts".|$|E

[...] Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is [...] "certainly good-looking... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold." ...|$|E
500|$|Her verse in Kanye West's [...] "Monster" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed and contributed greatly to her popularity; many critics {{said she had}} the best verse in the song. Her alter egos are incorporated with her lyrics in British accents (Roman Zolanski) or soft-spokenness (Harajuku Barbie). Ice-T said about Minaj's rapping style, [...] " [...] does her thing. She has her own way of doing it. She has an ill [...] vocal delivery. She kind of <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of a female Busta Rhymes, like how she throws her voice in different directions." ...|$|E

[...] "When I saw Romper Stomper (1992), I thought Russell was not only charismatic, attractive and talented but also fearless," [...] Stone reasoned. [...] "And I find fearlessness very attractive. I was convinced I wouldn't scare him." [...] Raimi found Crowe to be [...] "bold and challenging. He <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of what we imagine the American cowboy to have been like." [...] On working with Raimi, Crowe later described the director as [...] "sort of like the fourth Stooge." ...|$|E

Wood later commented that, [...] "We had matching tattoos because we knew our love would last forever. Trouble is, it didn't, things happened, we split. But I don't regret the tattoo.

500|$|After the Indiana game, Dari Nowkhah {{wrote in}} ESPN's [...] "Heisman Watch" [...] column that Robinson was [...] "running {{away with the}} Heisman Trophy" [...] and {{compared}} him to 1988 Heisman Trophy winner Barry Sanders:"We haven't seen this type of college football playmaker since ... Barry Sanders? [...] I'm not saying Robinson <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of Sanders. (How could a quarterback remind me of a running back?) But there is a shocking resemblance between the diminutive playmakers in their speed, elusiveness and quickness. So is the effect the two have on my {{sense of what is}} right and wrong. Being that dominant on a football field somehow feels wrong. It's unfair." ...|$|E
500|$|Leng views [...] "Who Can See It" [...] as a [...] "new type of ballad" [...] from Harrison, {{one that}} {{combines}} a [...] "dramatic edge" [...] with rhythmic sophistication. The time signature shifts throughout the composition, from 4/4 to 6/4 and 5/8, with brief portions in 5/4 and 3/4. In Leng's description, the melody features [...] "sweepingly large chromatic intervals", {{beginning with the}} verse's third line – a four-semitone swoop that recalls the ascending melismas commonly used in Indian music. Harrison later remarked, {{with reference to the}} boldness of the tune: [...] " [...] <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of Roy Orbison for some reason. He could do this good." ...|$|E

500|$|Facially, Bond {{resembles the}} composer, singer and actor Hoagy Carmichael. In Casino Royale Vesper Lynd remarks, [...] "Bond <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> rather of Hoagy Carmichael, {{but there is}} {{something}} cold and ruthless." [...] Likewise, in Moonraker, Special Branch Officer Gala Brand thinks that Bond is [...] "certainly good-looking... Rather like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes were cold." [...] Others, such as journalist Ben Macintyre, identify aspects of Fleming's own looks in his description of Bond. General references in the novels describe Bond as having [...] "dark, rather cruel good looks".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{began his}} review of Election by noting, [...] "I {{remember}} students like Tracy Flick, the know-it-all who always has {{her hand in the}} air, while the teacher desperately looks for someone else to call on. In fact, I was a student like Tracy Flick." [...] He goes on to compare Tracy to Elizabeth Dole: [...] "a person who always seems to be presenting you with a logical puzzle for which she is the answer... She is always perfectly dressed and groomed, and is usually able to conceal her hot temper behind a facade of maddening cheerfulness. But she is ruthless. She <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of a saying attributed to David Merrick: 'It is not enough for me to win. My enemies must lose.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{decided that}} Bond should {{resemble}} both the American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself, {{and in the}} novel Lynd remarks that [...] "Bond <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> rather of Hoagy Carmichael, {{but there is something}} cold and ruthless." [...] According to Andrew Lycett, Fleming's biographer, [...] "within the first few pages... had introduced most of Bond's idiosyncrasies and trademarks", which included his looks, his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits. The full details of Bond's martini were kept until chapter seven of the book and Bond eventually named it [...] "The Vesper", after Lynd. Bond's order, to be served in a deep champagne goblet, was for [...] "three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel." ...|$|E

500|$|Jackson had {{publicly}} {{stated that}} he was proud to be black. He also {{wrote a letter to}} photographer William Pecchi Jr. in 1988 which reads: [...] "Maybe I look at the world through rose colored glasses but I love people all over the world. That is why stories of racism really disturb me. [...] Because in truth I believe ALL men are created equal, I was taught that and will always believe it. I just can’t conceive of how a person could hate another because of skin color. I love every race on the planet earth. Prejudice is the child of ignorance. Naked we come into the world and naked we shall go out. And a very good thing too, for it <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> that I am naked under my shirt, whatever its color." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{songs were}} from McCartney's childhood, {{in which his}} father, Jim, would often be playing on the family piano. Most of the songs were played based on the sheet music, as LiPuma said that [...] "We'd have {{somebody}} write out a chord sheet for us, {{and then we went}} in and figured it out on the date". LiPuma also said McCartney wasn't unfamiliar with the group's way of recording, saying that McCartney said [...] "I love this. It <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of the way we used to do the Beatles. John [...] and I would write a song, we'd have a date booked at Abbey Road, and neither George Martin, George Harrison or Ringo [...] knew what the songs were about. They'd work it out right there in the room".|$|E
500|$|... {{definitely}} {{paved the}} way for the filmmakers and distributors of the world to know that there was a female audience that was really strong out there", Gabler recalls, one that was not segmented by age. She pointed to later movies, such as Mamma Mia!, 27 Dresses (written by McKenna) and Me Before You, that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Pradas success with that demographic. However, Gabler feels they did not do so as well. [...] "Prada <b>reminds</b> <b>me</b> of movies that we don't have a lot of now—it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ... You just keep wanting to find something that can touch upon the same zeitgeist as this film." ...|$|E
