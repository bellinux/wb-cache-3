40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role {{and the effect of}} the life cycle theory on {{explanation}} of dividend payout policy in Tehran Stock exchange listed companies over the period 2006 - 2011. For measuring the firm’s life cycle, two criteria namely <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> to equity ratio and <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> to assets ratio have been used as proxies of firm’s life cycle. The findings of this research show that only <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> to assets ratio has a meaningful and positive effect on dividend payout policy; In the companies that are growing, <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> to assets ratio is low; Whereas this ratio is high in the more mature companies and these firms have abundant <b>retained</b> <b>earnings,</b> hence they are good candidates to pay dividends.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{hypothesis}} that dividend taxes are capitalized into share prices by focusing on investors' implicit valuations of <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> versus paid-in equity. <b>Retained</b> <b>earnings</b> are distributable as taxable dividends, whereas paid-in equity is distributable as a tax-free return of capital. Consistent with dividend tax capitalization, firm-level results for the United States indicate that accumulated <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> are valued less per unit than contributed capital. In addition, differences in dividend tax rates across U.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} financial statement effects of firm attributes on {{the components of}} equity, the market reaction effects on key events in the adoption of IFRS, and the cumulative earnings response coefficient effect {{in the context of}} IFRS adoption in Canada. Firm attributes were tested for association with the adjustment to <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> at the transition date when first adopting International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS.) Evidence from the analyses of the adjustment to <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> model revealed a statistically significant association between the adjustment to <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> and the firm attributes of volatility of income, internationality, and firm industry. Market reaction was measured for two key events of IFRS adoption: early adoption announcement and the release of first quarter financial results under IFRS. A negative mean for Cumulative Average Return (CAR) resulted from tests of both events. However, only the negative mean CAR from market’s reaction to the release of first quarter financial results under IFRS demonstrated statistical significance. The adjustment to <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> model used in this study developed a benchmark for tests of value relevance. In the test of value relevance, the benchmark or unexpected adjustment to <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> was tested against the actual adjustment to <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> for market reaction. The results from the tests of value relevance were not statistically significant. This study contributes to the literature by identifying firm factors: volatility of income, internationality, and industry as firm factors associated with the adjustment to <b>retained</b> <b>earnings</b> upon adoption of IFRS. Further, evidence from the event study demonstrates that the market reacts negatively to the adoption of IFRS and suggests that the Canadian market may not perceive IFRS as an improvement in financial reporting or a reduction in information asymmetry...|$|R
