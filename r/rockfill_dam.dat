500|$|Iraq has {{commenced}} {{construction of}} the Bekhme and Deralok Dams and planned two others – the Khazir-Gomel and Mandawa Dams. Plans to build a dam in the Great Zab at the Bekhme Gorge for flood control and irrigation were first proposed in 1937. A feasibility study determined that the site was not suited for dam construction and the plan was abandoned. In 1976, another study proposed three different locations on the Great Zab, including the site suggested in the earlier study. This site was eventually chosen in 1989, when work on the dam commenced. Construction of the Bekhme Dam was interrupted by {{the outbreak of the}} Gulf War in 1990 and the dam remains unfinished. After the war, the site of the dam was looted. The plans of the Bekhme Dam called for a [...] high <b>rockfill</b> <b>dam</b> and an underground hydroelectric power station housing six turbines with a total capacity of 1,560 MW.

This research aims atevaluating {{the ability of the}} elasto-plastic with isotropic hardening (HS) model for simulating more realistic responses in theanalysis of high concrete face <b>rockfill</b> <b>dams.</b> The HS model and, for comparison, the hyperbolic elastic model are numericallyimplemented into a finite element program ABAQUS through the user subroutine to analyze the behaviors of rockfills underconstruction of a 182 m high dam. To obtain the reliable parameters in the analyses, the laboratory triaxial testing data ofrockfills from actual construction are adopted and the calibration by model simulation is also conducted. The analysis resultsfrom both models are compared to the high-quality instrumented data of dam construction. It is proven that by using the HSconstitutive model with the appropriately calibrated model parameters, the response of the <b>rockfills</b> under <b>dam</b> constructioncondition can be more accurately simulated...|$|R
40|$|A program 3 DSTAB {{combining}} {{slope stability}} analysis and reliability analysis is developed and validated. In this program, the limit equilibrium method is utilized to calculate safety factors of critical slip surfaces. The first-order reliability method {{is used to}} compute reliability indexes corresponding to critical probabilistic surfaces. When derivatives of the performance function are calculated by finite difference method, the previous iteration’s critical slip surface is saved and used. This sequential approximation strategy notably improves efficiency. Using this program, the stability reliability analyses of concrete faced <b>rockfill</b> <b>dams</b> and earth core <b>rockfill</b> <b>dams</b> with different heights and different slope ratios are performed. The results show that both safety factors and reliability indexes decrease as the dam’s slope increases at a constant height and as the dam’s height increases at a constant slope. They decrease dramatically as the dam height increases from 100 [*]m to 200 [*]m while they decrease slowly once the dam height exceeds 250 [*]m, which deserves attention. Additionally, both safety factors and reliability indexes of the upstream slope of earth core <b>rockfill</b> <b>dams</b> are {{higher than that of}} the downstream slope. Thus, the downstream slope stability is the key failure mode for earth core <b>rockfill</b> <b>dams...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{study of}} the effects of dam-foundation {{interaction}} on the response of earth, rockfill and concrete-faced <b>rockfill</b> <b>dams</b> to obliquely incident P, SV and Rayleigh waves is presented. Emphasis is placed on the effects of the foundation flexibility, the spatial variability of the ground motion and the material nonlinearity. The study is based on a rigorous hybrid numerical formulation that combines the efficiency and versatility of the Finite Element Method (FEM) and the ability of Boundary Element Method (BEM) to account for the radiation conditions at the far field. The developed hybrid method is very powerful, and can be used efficiently to obtain accurate solutions of problems of complex geometry, material heterogeneity and, for time-domain analysis, material nonlinearity. The 2 -D frequency-domain formulation is used at first to investigate the linear response of earth and <b>rockfill</b> <b>dams</b> to incident P, SV and Rayleigh waves and the response of concrete-faced <b>rockfill</b> <b>dams</b> to incident Rayleigh waves. Furthermore, the nonlinear time-domain coupled BE-FE formulation is used to investigate the response of earth and <b>rockfill</b> <b>dams</b> to vertically incident SV waves. By accounting rigorously for the energy radiated back into the halfspace, the study demonstrates the dramatic effect of the flexibility of the foundation rock in reducing the overall response of the dam. The effects of the spatial variability of the ground motion across the width of the dam are also shown to be important, but less dramatic than those of the foundation flexibility. Finally, the results from the nonlinear analysis of two different dams, each experiencing various degrees of nonlinearity, have demonstrated the great importance of the material nonlinear behavior on the response of dams subjected to strong ground motion...|$|R

The decision to build this major dam as a concrete faced <b>rockfill</b> <b>dam</b> was decided after studying several types of dams for the prevailing site conditions. The site conditions, which dictated the choice of the dam, are the narrow gorge of the river and the geological formation of highly friable sandstones at the dam site.

Nine earthquakes were experienced in Columbia between 1762 and 1994 with the earthquake event of 2 February 1736 with magnitude of 6.3 on Richter scale to last one on 6 June 1994 of magnitude 6.6 with epicentre of 73km distance of the project site, which caused severe damage and fatalities. Twenty-three active unstable slope areas, with two potentially unstable land slides (mud slides) are also noted in the project area.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- Models of real {{systems are}} of {{fundamental}} importance {{in virtually all}} disciplines. Models make possible to predict or simulate a system’s behavior. Since {{the quality of the}} model typically determines an upper bound {{on the quality of the}} final problem solution, modeling is often the bottleneck in the development of the whole system. As a consequence, a strong demand for advanced modeling and identification schemes arises. In this paper it is shown, via the development of a system for the analysis of the seismic response of <b>rockfill</b> <b>dams,</b> that neurogenetic techniques are a better option than analytically-based procedures in this kind of studies. To buttress this assertion, El Infiernillo dam, which has an ample history of being shaken by a great variety of seismic events, is used to this end.

40|$|Landslide dams pose {{enormous}} {{risks to}} the public because of the potentially catastrophic floods generated by breaching of such dams. The need {{to better understand the}} threats of landslide dams raises questions about the proper estimation of breaching parameters (breach size, breaching duration, and peak outflow rate) of landslide dams and the feasibility of applying models for estimating the breaching parameters of man-made earthen dams to landslide dams. This paper aims to answer these two questions. In this study, a database of 1, 239 landslide dams, including 257 cases formed during the 12 May 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, has been compiled. Based on records of 52 landslide dam cases with breaching information in the database, empirical models for estimating the breaching parameters of landslide dams are developed.
