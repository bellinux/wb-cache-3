5|$|The {{biological}} and geological future of Earth can be extrapolated {{based upon the}} estimated effects of several long-term influences. These include the chemistry at Earth's surface, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> of the planet's interior, the gravitational interactions with other objects in the Solar System, and a steady increase in the Sun's luminosity. An uncertain factor in this extrapolation is the ongoing influence of technology introduced by humans, such as climate engineering, which could cause significant changes to the planet. The current Holocene extinction is being caused by technology and the effects may last {{for up to five}} million years. In turn, technology may result in the extinction of humanity, leaving the planet to gradually return to a slower evolutionary pace resulting solely from long-term natural processes.|$|E
5|$|As the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> is {{increased}} the carbon {{will have less}} time to migrate to form carbide at the grain boundaries but will have increasingly large amounts of pearlite of a finer and finer structure within the grains; hence the carbide is more widely dispersed and acts to prevent slip of defects within those grains, resulting in hardening of the steel. At the very high cooling rates produced by quenching, the carbon has no time to migrate but is locked within the face center austenite and forms martensite. Martensite is a highly strained and stressed, supersaturated form of carbon and iron and is exceedingly hard but brittle. Depending on the carbon content, the martensitic phase takes different forms. Below 0.2% carbon, it takes on a ferrite BCC crystal form, but at higher carbon content it takes a body-centered tetragonal (BCT) structure. There is no thermal activation energy for the transformation from austenite to martensite. Moreover, there is no compositional change so the atoms generally retain their same neighbors.|$|E
25|$|The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> {{has been}} shown to {{influence}} the frost resistance of tissues, but the actual rate of freezing will depend not only on the cooling rate, but also on the degree of supercooling and the properties of the tissue. Sakai (1979a) demonstrated ice segregation in shoot primordia of Alaskan white and black spruces when cooled slowly to 30nbsp&°C to -40nbsp&°C. These freeze-dehydrated buds survived immersion in liquid nitrogen when slowly rewarmed. Floral primordia responded similarly. Extraorgan freezing in the primordia accounts for the ability of the hardiest of the boreal conifers to survive winters in regions when air temperatures often fall to -50nbsp&°C or lower. The hardiness of the winter buds of such conifers is enhanced by the smallness of the buds, by the evolution of faster translocation of water, and an ability to tolerate intensive freeze dehydration. In boreal species of Picea and Pinus, the frost resistance of 1-year-old seedlings is on a par with mature plants, given similar states of dormancy.|$|E
50|$|When water freezes in plants, the {{consequences}} for the plant depend very much on whether the freezing occurs within cells (intracellularly) or outside cells in intercellular spaces (Glerum 1985). Intracellular freezing, which usually kills the cell (Lyons et al. 1979) regardless of the hardiness of the plant and its tissues, seldom occurs in nature because <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> are rarely high enough to support it. <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>of</b> several degrees Celsius per minute are typically needed to cause intracellular formation of ice (Mazur 1977).|$|R

All three systems use liquid nitrogen to cool the plate or chamber which would hold the sample, opposed by a variable amount of heat from an internal heater. Maximum <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> for all systems were a function of the temperature gradient between the liquid nitrogen and the plate/chamber and at a plate/chamber temperature of 15 °C were 16. 5 °C/min, 13. 3 °C/min and 8. 0 °C/min for the Asymptote EF 100, Cryologic fast and slow chambers respectively. These machines are not suited to the freezing of sperm from species requiring rapid <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling,</b> an important consideration when planning to purchase a piece of equipment for this application, and scientists are advised to discuss specifically their requirements with prospective suppliers...|$|R
50|$|At <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>of</b> a {{few degrees}} Celsius per hour, {{segregation}} of ice occurs in intercellular spaces, the “extraorgan ice” of Sakai and Larcher (1987) and their coworkers. This {{may or may not}} be lethal, depending on the hardiness of the tissue.|$|R
25|$|Skeptics {{suggest that}} the palaeomagnetic data could be {{corrupted}} if Earth's ancient magnetic field was substantially different from today's. Depending on the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> of Earth's core, {{it is possible that}} during the Proterozoic, the magnetic field did not approximate a simple dipolar distribution, with north and south magnetic poles roughly aligning with the planet's axis as they do today. Instead, a hotter core may have circulated more vigorously and given rise to 4, 8 or more poles. Palaeomagnetic data would then have to be re-interpreted, as the sedimentary minerals could have aligned pointing to a 'West Pole' rather than the North Pole. Alternatively, Earth's dipolar field could have been oriented such that the poles were close to the equator. This hypothesis has been posited to explain the extraordinarily rapid motion of the magnetic poles implied by the Ediacaran palaeomagnetic record; the alleged motion of the north pole would occur around {{the same time as the}} Gaskiers glaciation.|$|E
500|$|As was {{explained}} by Leon Mestel in 1952, unless the white dwarf accretes matter from a companion star or other source, its radiation comes from its stored heat, {{which is not}} replenished.,§2.1. White dwarfs have an extremely small surface area to radiate this heat from, so they cool gradually, remaining hot for a long time. As a white dwarf cools, its surface temperature decreases, the radiation which it emits reddens, and its luminosity decreases. Since the white dwarf has no energy sink other than radiation, it follows that its cooling slows with time. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> has been estimated for a carbon white dwarf of 0.59 [...] with a hydrogen atmosphere. After initially taking approximately 1.5billion years to cool to a surface temperature of 7,140K, cooling approximately 500 more kelvins to 6,590K takes around 0.3billion years, but the next two steps of around 500kelvins (to 6,030K and 5,550K) take first 0.4 and then 1.1billion years., Table 2.|$|E
2500|$|Industrial {{cooling towers}} {{can be used}} to remove heat from various sources such as {{machinery}} or heated process material. [...] The primary use of large, industrial cooling towers is to remove the heat absorbed in the circulating cooling water systems used in power plants, petroleum refineries, petrochemical plants, natural gas processing plants, food processing plants, semi-conductor plants, and for other industrial facilities such as in condensers of distillation columns, for cooling liquid in crystallization, etc. The circulation <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> water in a typical 700 MW coal-fired power plant with a cooling tower amounts to about 71,600 cubic metres an hour (315,000 US gallons per minute) and the circulating water requires a supply water make-up rate of perhaps 5 percent (i.e., 3,600 cubic metres an hour).|$|E

40|$|Petrographic {{studies of}} {{samples of the}} Rajmahal basalt reveal a variety of {{microscopic}} joints within phenocrysts, which seem to have developed {{under the influence of}} thermal stresses during cooling. The theoretical analysis shows that: thermal stresses develop in a system only under unsteady state <b>of</b> <b>cooling,</b> the stresses responsible for the development of joints are tensile in nature, and the magnitude of stresses increases with increasing <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling.</b> In order to understand the eects <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>rate</b> on the mode of jointing, analogue model exper-iments were performed by quenching melt lms of organic, crystalline materials under varying cooling conditions.

2500|$|In June 1861 Thomson asked Phillips how geologists {{felt about}} Darwin's [...] "prodigious {{durations}} for geological epochs". and mentioned his own preliminary calculation that the Sun was 20 million years old, with the Earth at most 200 to 1,000 million years old.

2500|$|The {{eventual}} {{choice of}} the BMW 801 14-cylinder radial over the more troublesome BMW 139 also brought with it a BMW-designed cowling [...] "system" [...] which integrated the radiator used to cool the motor oil. An annular, ring-shaped oil cooler core was built into the BMW-provided forward cowl, just behind the fan. The outer portion of the oil cooler's core was {{in contact with the}} main cowling's sheet metal. Comprising the BMW-designed forward cowl, in front of the oil cooler was a ring of metal with a C-shaped cross-section, with the outer lip lying just outside the rim of the cowl, and the inner side {{on the inside of the}} oil cooler core. Together, the metal ring and cowling formed an S-shaped duct with the oil cooler's core contained between them. Airflow past the gap between the cowl and outer lip of the metal ring produced a vacuum effect that pulled air from the front of the engine forward across the oil cooler core to provide cooling for the 801's motor oil. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>cooling</b> airflow over the core could be controlled by moving the metal ring in order to open or close the gap. The reasons for this complex system were threefold. One was to reduce any extra aerodynamic drag of the oil radiator, in this case largely eliminating it by placing it within the same cowling as the engine. The second was to warm the air before it flowed to the radiator to aid warming the oil during starting. Finally, by placing the radiator behind the fan, cooling was provided even while the aircraft was parked. The disadvantage to this design was that the radiator was in an extremely vulnerable location, and the metal ring was increasingly armoured as the war progressed.|$|E
