5|$|In the {{earliest}} {{stages of the}} First World War the German Army's <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> along the North Sea coast found the German Imperial Navy without submarines suitable {{to operate in the}} narrow and shallow seas off Flanders. By 18 August 1914, two weeks after the German invasion of Belgium, the planning of a series of small coastal submarines had already begun.|$|E
5|$|Yarrell {{was aware}} of earlier bird handbooks, {{especially}} Bewick's. A History of British Birds used the same title as Bewick's popular book (1797–1804).

5|$|During the war, Adolf Hitler {{presented}} the palace {{as a reward}} to Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, who made it personal headquarters. This explains why the palace was so well preserved. The building was later converted into a museum for Wehrmacht officers stationed in and around Crimea. Originally, the Nazis had planned to dynamite the palace, but the <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> of the Separate Coastal Army and supporting Yalta partisan groups during the Crimean Offensive saved the palace from destruction.|$|E

5|$|The {{capture of}} Primosole Bridge {{did not lead}} to the {{expected}} <b>rapid</b> <b>advance,</b> as by this time the Germans had gathered their forces and established a defensive line. It was not until early the following month that the Eighth Army captured Catania. By this time the 1st Parachute Brigade had been withdrawn to Malta and took no further part in the conquest of Sicily. Lessons were learned from the operation and were put into practice in Allied airborne operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{third stage}} of the {{operation}} centred on the capture of Drvar, the secondary objective of the overall offensive. VRS defences around the town held until 14 September, when Gotovina detached a reinforced battalion from the 7th Guards Brigade held in the reserve of OG North and deployed it against Drvar. A renewed push by OGs West and South, combined with a <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> by the ARBiH 5th Corps against Bosanski Petrovac threatened to isolate Drvar, and the VRS withdrew from the town.|$|E
5|$|Japan's <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> south {{had been}} unexpected, and the {{perceived}} threat of invasion led to a major expansion of the Australian military. By mid-1942 the Army had a strength of ten infantry divisions, three armoured divisions {{and hundreds of other}} units. Thousands of Australians who were ineligible for service in the military responded to the threat of attack by joining auxiliary organisations such as the Volunteer Defence Corps and Volunteer Air Observers Corps, which were modelled on the British Home Guard and Royal Observer Corps respectively. However, Australia's population and industrial base were not sufficient to maintain these forces once the threat of invasion had passed, and the Army was progressively reduced in size from 1943.|$|E

5|$|On October20, 1944, General Douglas MacArthur's forces {{landed on}} Leyte, {{paving the way}} for the liberation of the Philippines. Several months later, as the Americans {{consolidated}} their forces to prepare for the main invasion of Luzon, nearly 150Americans were executed by their Japanese captors on December14, 1944 at the Puerto Princesa Prison Camp on the island of Palawan. These Americans were herded into air-raid shelters, sealed in, doused with gasoline, and burned alive. One of the survivors, PFC Eugene Nielsen, recounted his tale to U.S. Army Intelligence on January7, 1945. Two days later, MacArthur's forces landed on Luzon and began a <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> towards the capital, Manila.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Cavalry Division {{was down}} to half {{strength}} when it was withdrawn from the front line on Leyte for a brief rest in January 1945, but few reinforcements arrived before it was ordered to move to Luzon, where it disembarked over the beaches at San Fabian on 27 January 1945. General of the Army Douglas MacArthur ordered the 1st Cavalry Division's commander, Major General Vern D. Mudge, to conduct a <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> on Manila. For this, Mudge formed three flying columns. Initially, Chase's 1st Brigade's mission was to follow one of the columns but on 1 February he was relieved {{of responsibility for the}} main body of the 1st Brigade and placed in command of all three flying columns.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Yarmouk {{was a major}} {{battle between}} {{the army of the}} Byzantine Empire and the Muslim Arab forces of the Rashidun Caliphate. The battle {{consisted}} of a series of engagements that lasted for six days in August 636, near the Yarmouk River, along what today are the borders of Syria–Jordan and Syria–Israel, east of the Sea of Galilee. The result of the battle was a complete Muslim victory which ended Byzantine rule in Syria. The Battle of Yarmouk is {{regarded as one of the}} most decisive battles in military history, and it marked the first great wave of early Muslim conquests after the death of Prophet Muhammad, heralding the <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> of Islam into the then Christian Levant.|$|E

5|$|The {{recapture}} of Primosole Bridge did {{not result}} in the <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> over the Catania plain envisioned by Montgomery. The by now exhausted 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division was holding a position based on the bridge. The 5th Infantry Division took over the lead, but after a number of attacks could not make any further progress. Its 13th Infantry Brigade had to establish another bridgehead across the Simeto, but the Germans had brought in more troops and prepared defensive positions, and after hard fighting it was not until 5 August 1943 that the Eighth Army entered the city of Catania itself. Further hard fighting followed, and they entered Messina just after the United States Seventh Army on 17 August 1943.|$|E
5|$|With air {{supremacy}} attained, Luftflotte 2 turned to support of ground operations, particularly guarding the flanks of the armoured spearheads, without which the <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> was not possible. When enemy counterattacks threatened, Kesselring threw {{the full weight}} of his force against them. Now that the Army was convinced of the value of air support, units were all too inclined to call for it. Kesselring now had to convince the Army that air support should be concentrated at critical points. He strove to improve army–air cooperation with new tactics and the appointment of Colonel Martin Fiebig as a special close air support commander. By 26 July, Kesselring reported the destruction of 165 tanks, 2,136 vehicles and 194 artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Australian {{forces were}} heavily {{reinforced}} by the 7thDivision's 21st and 25th Brigades. Supported logistically by native Papuans who were recruited by the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit, often forcibly, to carry supplies and evacuate wounded personnel, the Australians pursued the Japanese back along the Kokoda Track. In early November, they had been forced into a small bridgehead on the north coast of Papua. Australian and US forces attacked the Japanese bridgehead in Papua in late November1942. The Allied force consisted of the exhausted 7thDivision and the inexperienced and ill-trained US 32ndInfantry Division, and was short of artillery and supplies. Due {{to a lack of}} supporting weapons and MacArthur and Blamey's insistence on a <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> the Allied tactics during the battle were centred on infantry assaults on the Japanese fortifications. These resulted in heavy casualties and the area was not secured until 22January1943.|$|E

The Australians generally did not attempt to capture Japanese personnel, and some prisoners of war were murdered.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{the outcome}} of the Holbrooke–Tuđman meeting and the {{assessment}} of the HV General Staff that the VRS 2nd Corps was completely destroyed, a decision was made to deploy the HV to the area with virtually no preparation and planning. The assessment of the HV General Staff was based on ARBiH gains in western Bosnia and Herzegovina over the previous four days. The order to attack was drawn up on 17 September and signed by Major General Vinko Vrbanac on behalf of the Chief of the General Staff, General Zvonimir Červenko. The attack, codenamed Operation Una, was to commence with crossings of the Una River at Novi Grad and Bosanska Dubica, and the Sava River at Jasenovac, followed by the seizing of Mount Prosara to allow for further advances towards Prijedor. The operation was intended to be coordinated with the ARBiH 5th Corps, which would continue its <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> towards Prijedor and Novi Grad.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 54 BC, a wave of {{political}} corruption and violence swept Rome. This chaos reached a climax in January of 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war by Milo. On 1 January 49 BC, an agent of Caesar presented an ultimatum to the senate. The ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the Republic. Meanwhile, the senators adopted Pompey as their new champion against Caesar. On 7 January of 49 BC, the senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum, which vested Pompey with dictatorial powers. Pompey's army, however, was composed largely of untested conscripts. On 10 January, Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his veteran army (in violation of Roman laws) and marched towards Rome. Caesar's <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> forced Pompey, the consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece. Caesar entered the city unopposed.|$|E

5|$|MacArthur {{attempted}} {{to slow the}} Japanese advance with an initial defense against the Japanese landings. MacArthur's plan for holding all of Luzon against the Japanese collapsed as it spread out the American-Filipino forces too thin. However, he reconsidered his confidence {{in the ability of}} his Filipino troops after the Japanese landing force made a <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> after landing at Lingayen Gulf on 21 December, and ordered a retreat to Bataan. Within two days of the Japanese landing at Lingayen Gulf, MacArthur had reverted to pre-July 1941 plan of attempting to hold only Bataan while waiting for a relief force to come. Most of the American and some of the Filipino troops were able to retreat back to Baatan, but without most of their supplies, which were abandoned in the confusion. Manila was declared an open city at midnight on 24 December, without any consultation with Admiral Thomas C. Hart, commanding the Asiatic Fleet, forcing the Navy to destroy considerable amounts of valuable material.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur's {{primary concern}} was the capture of the port of Manila and the airbase at Clark Field, which were {{required}} to support future operations. He urged his commanders on. On 25 January 1945, he moved his advanced headquarters forward to Hacienda Luisita, closer to the front than Krueger's. He ordered the 1st Cavalry Division to conduct a <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> on Manila. It reached the northern outskirts of Manila on 3 February, but, unknown to the Americans, Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi had decided to defend Manila to the death. The Battle of Manila raged {{for the next three}} weeks. To spare the civilian population, MacArthur prohibited the use of air strikes, but thousands of civilians died in the crossfire or Japanese massacres. He also refused to restrict the traffic of civilians who clogged the roads in and out of Manila, placing humanitarian concerns above military ones except in emergencies. For his part in the capture of Manila, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Cross.|$|E
5|$|On {{the opening}} day of the Second Battle of El Alamein, Kippenberger led his brigade, which had spent much of the {{previous}} weeks in defensive lines, in an attack on Miteirya Ridge during which it achieved all of its objectives. In contrast to three months earlier at Ruweisat Ridge, he took care to establish his headquarters as far forward as possible prior to the commencement of the battle to minimise communication difficulties with the units of the brigade. Despite this, he still lost contact with the leading 23rd Battalion which quickly overwhelmed its opposition. In fact, the battalion had advanced so quickly that it arrived at its final objective so far ahead of schedule that it believed it had only reached its first objective and so advanced even further. The battalion's commander blamed his unit's eagerness for a <b>rapid</b> <b>advance</b> on Kippenberger's inspirational pre-battle speech which particularly enthused his men.|$|E
