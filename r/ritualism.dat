5|$|Henson's {{beliefs on}} {{doctrine}} were still forming, but he inclined to high-churchmanship and {{was influenced by}} Charles Gore and the Puseyites, though he was unattracted by more extreme Anglo-Catholic forms of <b>ritualism.</b> With his suspicion of nonconformism he was a proponent {{of the principle of}} establishment– the maintenance of Anglicanism as the official state religion– and in 1886 he became secretary of the new Oxford Laymen's League for Defence of the National Church, to counter the threat of disestablishment proposed by politicians such as Joseph Chamberlain and Charles Dilke.|$|E
5|$|In Britain and Australia, early {{memorials}} {{were closely}} linked to the need to promote military recruitment and the state had an ambivalent attitude towards the informal memorials that emerged during the conflict. In Britain, stone memorials to the war began to be erected in towns and villages from 1915 onwards; some of these were given out by the state as rewards to communities for meeting military recruitment targets. In Australia, the existing memorials to mark the Boer War were used initially for commemorative ceremonies intended to increase military recruitment. As casualties increased, rolls of honour listing the dead began to be displayed in Britain and honour tablets with the names of those who had enlisted were put up inside Australian buildings: Australia used these lists to apply moral pressure on those who were not yet joined up. Informal memorials began to multiply as the war progressed. Local Australian groups erected small monuments, such as drinking fountains and stone pillars, {{to the point where the}} government became concerned about the expenditure on them and passed a law in 1916 to control their numbers. In Britain, some Anglican church leaders began to create street war shrines to the dead. These cheap, local memorials were mainly constructed in working class districts, often built from wood and paper, and were used for holding short services in honour of the dead and to hold donations of flowers. They were criticised, however, as promoting Catholic <b>ritualism.</b> Official support for the shrines only came after a national newspaper campaign, efforts by the Lord Mayor of London and a well-publicised visit from Queen Mary to a shrine, and standardised stone shrines then began to replace the earlier, temporary versions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ritualism,</b> in {{the history}} of Christianity, refers to an {{emphasis}} on the rituals and liturgical ceremony of the church, in particular of Holy Communion.|$|E
25|$|Arguments about <b>ritualism</b> in the Church of England {{were often}} shaped by {{opposing}} (and often unannounced) attitudes towards {{the concept of}} sola scriptura {{and the nature of}} the authority of the Bible for Christians.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>ritualism</b> had an {{aesthetic}} and ideological appeal {{for many in}} the cultural elite, and had a cognate relationship with the Gothic Revival, the idea that it was inextricably linked with an inclination towards political despotism was a misapprehension. <b>Ritualism</b> had an appeal for many who were politically conservative and had supporters highly placed in the establishment (e.g. Viscount Halifax and the 4th Marquess of Bath). However, the outlook of many of the ritualist clergy themselves, many of whom inevitably operated {{in some of the most}} deprived communities in England, resulted in their becoming politically radicalised by the experience – some became ardent Christian Socialists.|$|E
25|$|In 1874 the Government, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Disraeli, with the backing of both Primates and many Bishops, decided to crush <b>ritualism</b> in the Church of England by passing the Public Worship Regulation Act to control religious belief.|$|E
25|$|In {{regards to}} religion, the {{majority}} of inhabitants (about 50%) are Roman Catholic, followed by Protestant religions (especially among the people of German origin), such as Evangelical Lutheran and Anglican sects. In recent times {{there has also been}} a growing number of Jehovah's Witnesses and Latter-day Saints. Other noteworthy religions include Spiritism and Afro-Brazilian <b>ritualism</b> (such as Umbanda and Candomblé).|$|E
25|$|A {{denial of}} the epistemic {{authority}} of the Vedas and Upanishads {{was one of the}} several differences between Sramanic philosophies and orthodox Hinduism. Jaini states that while authority of vedas, belief in a creator, path of <b>ritualism</b> and social system of heredity ranks, made up the cornerstones of Brahminal schools, the path of ascetic self-motification was the main characteristic of all the Sramanic schools.|$|E
25|$|Some evangelical {{groups have}} claimed that the Orange Order is still {{influenced}} by freemasonry. Many Masonic traditions survive, such as the organisation of the Order into lodges. The Order has a similar system of degrees through which new members advance. These degrees are interactive plays with references to the Bible. There is particular concern over the <b>ritualism</b> of higher degrees such as the Royal Arch Purple and the Royal Black Institutions.|$|E
25|$|The clearest {{illustration}} of the shift that took place within Anglo-Catholicism from theological to liturgical questions {{is to be found}} in Pusey's attitude towards <b>ritualism.</b> Pusey, the only pre-eminent first-generation leader of Anglo-Catholicism to survive into the second generation, had no sympathy with the preoccupation with ritual. However, when priests started to be prosecuted and imprisoned as a result of the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874, Pusey was quick to show his support for those who were prosecuted.|$|E
25|$|Ryle was {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of the evangelical school and a critic of <b>Ritualism.</b> He was a writer, pastor and an evangelical preacher. Among his longer works are Christian Leaders of the Eighteenth Century (1869), Expository Thoughts on the Gospels (7 vols, 1856–69), Principles for Churchmen (1884). Ryle was described as having a commanding presence and vigorous in advocating his principles albeit with a warm disposition. He was also credited with having success in evangelizing the blue collar community.|$|E
25|$|Like most {{churches of}} the Anglican Communion, the ACC was beset by intense {{conflict}} over the <b>ritualism</b> controversies {{of the latter}} 19th century, leading in some extreme cases to schism. Throughout much of the 20th century, parishes – and, to a certain extent, dioceses or regions – {{were more or less}} divided between high church (Anglo-Catholic), low church (evangelical), and broad church (middle-of-the-road). Many of these designations have become muted with time, as the passions which fired the debate have cooled and most parishes have found a happy medium or accommodation.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversial}} priest William James Early Bennett {{was appointed}} as the vicar in 1852. Bennett is celebrated for having provoked {{the decision that}} {{the doctrine of the}} Real Presence is a dogma not inconsistent with the creed of the Church of England. As a leading member of the Oxford Movement he had served as vicar to various churches in London but resigned in 1851, following doctrinal complaints and a theological dispute with his bishop, Charles Blomfield - after being accused of <b>ritualism.</b> His publication The Old Church Porch (1854–1862), issued at Frome, is sometimes cited as being in effect the first parish magazine, although this claim has been disputed.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundational}} {{text for}} the Mimamsa {{school is the}} Purva Mimamsa Sutras of Jaimini (c. third to first century BCE). The school reached its height c. 700 CE, and for {{some time in the}} Early Middle Ages exerted near-dominant influence on learned Hindu thought. The Mimamsa school saw their primary enquiry was into the nature of dharma based on close interpretation of the Vedas. Its core tenets were <b>ritualism</b> (orthopraxy), antiasceticism and antimysticism. The early Mimamsakas believed in an adrishta ("unseen") that is the result of performing karmas ("works") and saw no need for an Ishvara ("God") in their system. Mimamsa persists in some subschools of Hinduism today.|$|E
25|$|From the 1870s {{into the}} early 20th century, evangelicals came to feel {{increasingly}} marginalized as <b>ritualism</b> became more common place within the Church of England. As Evangelicalism continued to lose ground to the high-church party, a split became apparent between conservative evangelicals and liberal evangelicals. Liberal evangelicals led by Vernon Storr coalesced into the Anglican Evangelical Group Movement. Their position was outlined in the 1923 collection of essays Liberal Evangelicalism, which argued that Evangelicalism had been discredited and needed {{to move away from}} strict notions of penal substitutionary atonement and scriptural infallibility. Conservatives accused liberal evangelicals of being no different from the older broad church liberals that evangelicals had always opposed.|$|E
25|$|The Yoga Sutras {{incorporated}} {{the teachings of}} many other Indian philosophical systems prevalent at the time. Samkhya and Yoga {{are thought to be}} two of the many schools of philosophy that originated over the centuries that had common roots in the non-Vedic cultures and traditions of India. The orthodox Hindu philosophies of Samkhya, Yoga, Vedanta, as well as the non-orthodox Nastika systems of Jainism and Buddhism can all be seen as representing one stream of spiritual activity in ancient India, in contrast to the Bhakti traditions and Vedic <b>ritualism</b> which were also prevalent at the same time. The Vedanta-Sramana traditions, iconolatry and Vedic rituals can be identified with the Jnana marga, Bhakti marga and the Karma marga respectively that are outlined in the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} for <b>ritualism</b> in Anglicanism was {{also based on}} the slightly misleading analogy {{with the success of}} the Roman Catholic Church amongst the highly impoverished Irish migrant communities in the urban areas of England – it was argued by some that ritual {{played a key role in}} the growth of the Roman Catholic Church amongst the poor. However, the use of ritual probably played little more than a subsidiary role in the success of the Catholic Church in this area: its success was probably largely due to a special cultural identity that many Irish migrants felt with the Roman Catholic Church as one of the few institutions that they encountered in diaspora that was also a key feature of life in their homeland.|$|E
25|$|Dnyaneshwar {{was born}} in 1275 (on the auspicious day of Krishna Janmashtami) in Apegaon village {{on the bank of}} Godavari river near Paithan in Maharashtra during the reign of the Yadava king Ramadevarava., The kingdom enjoyed peace and {{stability}} until invasions from the Delhi Sultanate started in 1296 CE. Arts and sciences flourished under the patronage of the Yadava kings and Maharashtra attracted scholars from all over India. However, this period also witnessed religious degeneration, sectarianism, superstition and <b>ritualism</b> which involved animal sacrifices to many local deities. Dnyaneshwar would later criticise the religious degeneration of the day in his magnum opus Dnyaneshwari. According to B. P. Bahirat, Dnyaneshwar emerged as the first original philosopher who wrote in the Marathi language, in this era.|$|E
25|$|American Anti-Catholicism has {{its origins}} in the Reformation. Because the Reformation {{was based on an}} effort to correct what it {{perceived}} to be errors and excesses of the Catholic Church, it formed strong positions against the Roman clerical hierarchy and the Papacy in particular. These positions were brought to the New World by British colonists who were predominantly Protestant, and who opposed not only the Roman Catholic Church but also the Church of England which, due to its perpetuation of Catholic doctrine and practices, was deemed to be insufficiently reformed, see also <b>Ritualism.</b> Because many of the British colonists, such as the Puritans, were fleeing religious persecution, early American religious culture exhibited a more extreme anti-Catholic bias of these Protestant denominations, thus were Roman Catholics forbidden from holding public office.|$|E
25|$|Machen, {{brought up}} {{as the son of}} a Church of England clergyman, always held Christian beliefs, though {{accompanied}} by a fascination with sensual mysticism; his interests in paganism and the occult were especially prominent in his earliest works. Machen was well read on such matters as alchemy, the kabbalah, and Hermeticism, and these occult interests formed part of his close friendship with A. E. Waite. Machen, however, was always very down to earth, requiring substantial proof that a supernatural event had occurred, and was thus highly sceptical of Spiritualism. Unlike many of his contemporaries, such as Oscar Wilde and Alfred Douglas, his disapproval of the Reformation and his admiration for the medieval world and its Roman Catholic <b>ritualism</b> did not fully tempt him away from Anglicanism—though he never fitted comfortably into the Victorian Anglo-Catholic world.|$|E
25|$|These {{innovations}} {{have been}} responded to in various ways. The opposition to <b>Ritualism</b> produced the Reformed Episcopal Church in 1873. Opposition to {{the ordination of}} women priests and to theological revisions incorporated into the Episcopal Church's 1979 Book of Common Prayer {{led to the formation of}} the Continuing Anglican movement in 1977; and opposition to the consecration of the first ever openly homosexual bishop led to the creation of the Anglican Church in North America. It officially organized in 2009, forming yet another ecclesiastical structure apart from the Episcopal Church. This grouping, which reported at its founding that it represented approximately 100,000 Christians through its over 700 parishes, elected former Episcopal Robert Duncan as its primate. The ACNA has not been received as an official member of the Anglican Communion by the Church of England, and is not in communion with the see of Canterbury, but many Anglican churches of the Global South, such as the Church of Nigeria and Church of Uganda, together representing approximately 1/3 of the worldwide Anglican Communion, have declared themselves to be in full communion with it.|$|E
25|$|Though now {{a private}} member, Harcourt still {{continued}} to assert his independent position, and his {{attacks on the}} government were no longer restrained by any deference to Liberal Imperialism. He actively intervened in 1899 and 1900, strongly condemning the government's financial policy and their attitude towards the Transvaal. Throughout the Second Boer War he lost no opportunity of criticising the South African developments in a pessimistic vein. A great parliamentary debater, he sprinkled his speeches with humour. From 1898 to 1900 he was conspicuous, both on the platform and in letters to The Times, in demanding active measures against <b>Ritualism</b> in the Church of England. However, his attitude in this was reflected in his political advocacy of disestablishment. In March 1904, just after he had announced his intention not to seek election again to parliament, he succeeded, {{by the death of}} his nephew, to the family estates at Nuneham. He found that the estate was in crisis, especially after having to pay the death duties he himself had introduced, and he died suddenly there in the same year.|$|E
500|$|The Upanishads ( [...] ; [...] ), {{a part of}} the Vedas, are [...] ancient Sanskrit {{texts that}} contain some of the central {{philosophical}} concepts and ideas of Hinduism, some of which are shared with Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism.

Of all Vedic literature, the Upanishads alone are widely known, and their central ideas are at the spiritual core of Hindus.|$|E
500|$|Buddhists {{are not in}} {{agreement}} {{with regard to the}} interpretation, role, and importance of merit. The role of merit-making in Buddhism has been discussed throughout Buddhist history, but much more so in the last centuries. In the nineteenth century, during the rise of Buddhist modernism and the Communist regimes, Buddhists in South and Southeast Asia became more critical about merit-making when it became associated with magical practices, privileging, <b>ritualism</b> and waste of resources. In [...] pre-modern Thailand, {{a great deal of the}} funds of temples were derived from the profits of land that were offered to temples by royalty and nobility. During the period of religious reform and administrative centralization in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, however, Thai temples were no longer supported in this manner and had to find other ways to maintain themselves.|$|E
