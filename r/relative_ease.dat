5|$|After {{extensive}} {{negotiations to}} implement a collateral structure open to all eurozone countries, on 4 October 2011, a modified escrow collateral agreement was reached. The expectation is that only Finland will utilise it, due, in part, to a requirement to contribute initial capital to European Stability Mechanism in one instalment instead of five instalments over time. Finland, {{as one of the}} strongest AAA countries, can raise the required capital with <b>relative</b> <b>ease.</b>|$|E

5|$|The <b>relative</b> <b>ease</b> {{of making}} reproductions has also {{encouraged}} many forgeries: {{a survey of}} expert opinion placed Rodin in the top ten most-faked artists. Rodin fought against forgeries of his works as early as 1901, and since his death, many cases of organized, large-scale forgeries have been revealed. A massive forgery was discovered by French authorities in the early 1990s {{and led to the}} conviction of art dealer Guy Hain.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand how people with cancer perceive the presence or absence of relatives while undergoing treatment away from home. A Heideggerian phenomenological research was conducted with 11 people undergoing antineoplastic treatment and lodged in a support house. Data were collected between June and September 2013, by means of in-depth interviews. The following ontological themes were originated: strengthening relationships with the family presence, recognizing the need for family presence and revealing the importance of treatment companions in the family absence. The study revealed that people with cancer recognize that the presence of <b>relatives</b> <b>eases</b> the situation experienced, since they authentically embrace and provide them with more intimate care. In conclusion, the family presence reduces the distance from home and improves the coping with the disease. In the absence of relatives, patients find support and comfort in companions from the support house...|$|R

Construction of the M61 motorway in 1969–1970 to carry Manchester traffic northbound had its northern terminus connect to a new junction on the by-pass at Bamber Bridge, requiring the construction of Blacow Bridge to carry the north-bound M61 traffic over the M6.|$|E
5|$|As the long-tailed {{ground roller}} is remarkably silent and {{difficult}} to see during the non-breeding season, the local inhabitants of Madagascar once believed that this bird hibernated in its burrows. While not particularly tasty, this species is hunted for food due to its large size and the <b>relative</b> <b>ease</b> of capture compared with arboreal birds. In the early twentieth century, it was hunted by herdsmen with blowguns. In the 1950s and 1960s, natives trapped this ground roller and dug out its nesting burrows. This bird has been featured on several of Madagascar's stamps. Only one zoo, Germany's Weltvogelpark Walsrode, keeps this species. It is considered by birdwatchers {{to be one of}} the world's most elusive birds.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} ability to quickly grow and the <b>relative</b> <b>ease</b> with which they can be manipulated, {{bacteria}} are the workhorses for the fields of molecular biology, genetics and biochemistry. By making mutations in bacterial DNA and examining the resulting phenotypes, scientists can determine the function of genes, enzymes and metabolic pathways in bacteria, then apply this knowledge to more complex organisms. This aim of understanding the biochemistry of a cell reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of enzyme kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. This is achievable in some well-studied bacteria, with models of Escherichia coli metabolism now being produced and tested. This understanding of bacterial metabolism and genetics allows the use of biotechnology to bioengineer bacteria for the production of therapeutic proteins, such as insulin, growth factors, or antibodies.|$|E

5|$|British ornithologist David Lack {{considered}} that the Puerto Rican amazon had {{evolved from the}} Hispaniolan amazon (A. ventralis) found in Hispaniola, but it has since been argued that he omitted some elements in his analysis, including the similarities found between the black-billed amazon (A. agilis) of Jamaica and the Puerto Rican amazon. Subsequent studies showed that size and color patterns were not sufficient to assess evolutionary relationships, and that patterns changed with <b>relative</b> <b>ease</b> even within {{members of the same}} species.

Both sides were aware, because of the greater number of British dreadnoughts, that a full fleet engagement would likely result in a British victory.

5|$|Owing {{to their}} {{stability}} and <b>relative</b> <b>ease</b> of preparation, rhodocenium salts are the usual starting material for preparing rhodocene and substituted rhodocenes, {{all of which}} are unstable. The original synthesis used a cyclopentadienyl anion and tris(acetylacetonato)rhodium(III); numerous other approaches have since been reported, including gas-phase redox transmetalation and using half-sandwich precursors. Octaphenylrhodocene (a derivative with eight phenyl groups attached) was the first substituted rhodocene to be isolated at room temperature, though it decomposes rapidly in air. X-ray crystallography confirmed that octaphenylrhodocene has a sandwich structure with a staggered conformation. Unlike cobaltocene, which has become a useful one-electron reducing agent in research, no rhodocene derivative yet discovered is stable enough for such applications.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} calculating arbitrary-order {{diffraction}} efficiencies of thick, lossless transmission gratings with arbitrary periodic grating shapes has been developed.
