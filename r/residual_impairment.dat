Methods and procedures: Discharge destinations from hospital to home and frequency of outpatient visits were determined. Outcome was defined 1 year after injury by the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale and Return to Work. Results: Most (94 %) patients had returned home 1 -year after injury despite cognitive (76 %), behavioural (67 %) and physical (55 %) impairments. One in four patients was severely disabled and 32 % had resumed work on a previous level. Two-thirds of all patients went home as secondary discharge destination and 50 % needed inpatient rehabilitation. Almost half of patients needed outpatient care, mostly for behavioural and cognitive impairments. One in 10 patients consulted a psychiatrist, with 55 % unfavourable outcome. Of those patients initially discharged to home without follow-up, eventually 10 % needed outpatient rehabilitation. Conclusions: One-year after injury most patients had returned home with <b>residual</b> <b>impairments</b> and frequent medical consultations.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} an unprecedented explosion in mobile data traffic, {{due to the}} expansion of numerous types of wireless devices, which have enabled a plethora of data-hungry applications. Novel techniques, such as large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, represent potential candidates to support the ever-growing demands. However, large-scale MIMO systems will be a viable solution only if low-cost and energy-efficient hardware is deployed, which is particularly prone to impairments. Previous works have reported effective calibration schemes and compensation algorithms to mitigate individual hardware impairments, such as I/Q imbalance, phase noise and amplifier nonlinearities. However, a certain amount of <b>residual</b> hardware <b>impairments</b> always persist. In this thesis, we aim at exploring the fundamental limits that <b>residual</b> hardware <b>impairments</b> have imposed on MIMO systems, and more interestingly, on large-scale MIMO systems. We consider both the cases whereof the receiver has perfect channel state information (CSI) and estimated CSI. Important insights are gained through the analysis of system performance indicators, such as ergodic channel capacity and achievable rates, channel estimation accuracy and energy efficiency. Paper A characterizes the ergodic channel capacity of Rayleigh fading channels in the presence of transceiver <b>residual</b> hardware <b>impairments.</b> Closed-form capacity formulas for MIMO systems with arbitrary number of antennas and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values are derived, while approximations at low and high SNRs are also presented. We further extend our results to large-scale MIMO systems, and derive the channel capacity in the asymptotic regime. Paper B, which is a journal version of Paper D, considers a training-based MIMO system with transmit <b>residual</b> hardware <b>impairments.</b> The impact of <b>residual</b> hardware <b>impairments</b> on channel estimation accuracy and achievable rates with different linear receivers is theoretically analyzed. The achievable-rate-maximizing training lengths are thereafter presented. For large-scale MIMO systems, we derive deterministic equivalents of the achievable rates, and the corresponding optimal training lengths. In paper C, we assess <b>residual</b> hardware <b>impairments</b> from an energy-efficiency perspective. Assuming estimated CSI and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers, we find the optimal training lengths, as well as, the number of transmit and receive antennas that maximize the system energy efficiency at any given SNR, through a proposed iterative sequential optimization algorithm...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the emotional response to caregiving among stroke caregivers living in Luxembourg, and to assess the social and psychological impact of strokes on households, two years after the event.

The survey focused on: 1) <b>residual</b> <b>impairments,</b> based on the American Heart Association Stroke Outcome Classification; 2) the Caregiver Reaction Assessment (CRA – 24 items – 5 dimensions); and 3) changes in the division of household tasks (seven items). Although male and female caregivers care for patients with similar <b>residual</b> <b>impairments,</b> the study found that female caregivers were more likely to be affected by the impact of caregiving on their health and schedule and by lack of family support. Women were more likely to feel “tired all the time” (50 % vs. 12. 5 %), to struggle to “find time to relax” (35. 7 % vs. 6. 3 %) and to feel that “others dumped caring onto them” (35. 7 % vs. 11. 8 %). Since the onset of stroke, women had also taken on more responsibilities in the household (37. 5 % vs. 5. 9 %), while men were more likely to “enjoy caring” for patients (93. 8 % vs. 67. 9 %) and to have become more involved in organizing holidays (29 % vs. 5. 6 %) and seeing friends (20. 6 % vs. 10. 5 %).

An increase in the proposed approximated achievable rate is also observed by adopting the optimal training sequence length.

40|$|Background Patients with {{degenerative}} {{aortic stenosis}} (AS) referred for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) typically have advanced cardiac and vascular adverse remodeling and multiple comorbidities and, therefore, might not recover a normal functional capacity after valve replacement.

Methods and results Out of 790 patients undergoing TAVI with impaired functional capacity (NYHA II-IV) at baseline, NYHA functional class improved in 592 (86. 5 %) and remained unchanged/worsened in 92 (13. 5 %) at follow-up [median (IQR) : 419 (208 - 807) days] after TAVI. Normal functional capacity (NYHA I) was recovered in 65. 5 % (n = 448) of patients, while the rest had variable degrees of <b>residual</b> <b>impairment.</b> On multivariable regression analysis, atrial fibrillation [odds ratio-OR, 2. 08 (1. 21 - 3. 58), p = 0. 008], low-flow-low-gradient AS [OR, 1. 97 (1. 09 - 3. 57), p = 0. 026], {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} [OR, 1. 92 (1. 19 - 3. 12), p = 0. 008], and lower hemoglobin at baseline [OR, 1. 11 (1. 01 - 1. 21) for each g% decrement, p = 0. 036] were independently associated with <b>residual</b> <b>impairment</b> of functional capacity. All-cause and cardiac mortality were significantly higher in those with <b>residual</b> <b>impairment</b> of functional capacity than in those in NYHAI class [hazard ratio-HR: 2. 37 (95 % CI: 1. 51 - 3. 72), p < 0. 001 and 2. 16 (95 % CI: 1. 08 - 4. 35), p = 0. 030, respectively].

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To explore {{barriers}} and facilitators to staying in work following stroke. DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of posts regarding staying in work following stroke using {{the archives of}} an online forum for stroke survivors. PARTICIPANTS: 60 stroke survivors (29 male, 23 female, 8 not stated; mean age at stroke 44  years) who have returned to work, identified using terms 'return to work' and 'back at work'. SETTING: Posts from UK stroke survivors and family members on Talkstroke, the forum of the Stroke Association, between 2004 and 2011. RESULTS: Stroke and transient ischaemic attack (TIA) survivors reported <b>residual</b> <b>impairments</b> that for many had impact on work. Most impairments were 'invisible', including fatigue, problems with concentration, memory and personality changes. Participants described positive (eg, back at work being better than expected) and negative work experiences, including being at risk of losing the job because of stroke-related impairments. Barriers to successfully staying in work included {{lack of understanding of}} stroke [...] in particular invisible impairments [...] of survivors, employers and general practitioners (GPs), and lack of support in terms of formal adjustments, and 'feeling supported'. Stroke survivors described how they developed their own coping strategies, and how workplace and employer helped them to stay in work. CONCLUSIONS: Despite having been able to return to work after a stroke, people may still experience difficulties in staying in work and risking losing their job. There is a need to improve awareness, in particular of invisible stroke-related impairments, among stroke survivors, work personnel and clinicians. This might be achieved through improved assessments of <b>residual</b> <b>impairments</b> in the workplace and in general practice. Future studies should investigate the effect of unrecognised fatigue and invisible impairments on staying in work following stroke, and explore the potential role for primary care in supporting stroke survivors who have returned to employment.

In this direction, Dual-Hop (DH) Amplify-and-Forward (AF) relaying has been widely investigated due to its simplicity, low implementation complexity and low transmission delay. However, most existing works assume ideal transceiver hardware which is impractical. In practice, a cost-efficient wireless transceiver has to combat the effects of several inevitable impairments such as high power amplifier nonlinearities, In-phase/Quadrature-phase (I/Q) -imbalance, and oscillator phase noise, which can be only partially compensated using calibration algorithms.

In addition, we optimize the ergodic achievable rates with respect to the training sequence length, and demonstrate that finite dimensional systems with RTRI generally require more training at high SNRs than those with ideal hardware. At last, we extend our analysis to large-scale MIMO configurations, and derive deterministic equivalents of the ergodic achievable rates. It is shown that, by deploying large receive antenna arrays, the extra training requirements due to RTRI can be eliminated.
