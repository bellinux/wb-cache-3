50|$|Financing for {{the company}} was always difficult, as the large rural {{population}} meant the construction and maintenance of many miles of poles and wire for each <b>rural</b> <b>subscriber.</b> In the early years, subscribers who could not pay rentals had their phone removed at their expense; however, {{by the time of}} the depression in the 1930s, this was no longer practical or desirable. Instead, subscribers were able to pay off their debt by assisting in the erection of new lines and the maintenance of old ones. Because of the difficulties associated with providing rural telephone service, it was resolved by the Rural Telephone Company as early as 1930 that they ask the provincial government to take over telephone operation for the entire province. While the government did finally take over telephone service, this did not occur until the late 1970s.|$|E

50|$|In most areas, one carrier held a {{monopoly}} on local service. The landline telephone system was originally constructed in an era before transistorisation, remote concentrators or cabinetisation. Individual lines from subscribers ran not to a remote concentrator but directly to the nearest village community dial office, to be terminated at an automated mechanical switch or manual exchange. To keep subscriber loop wiring requirements manageable, local exchanges were built in each tiny hamlet. <b>Rural</b> <b>subscribers</b> often made do with party line service. Each village was a separate rate center for long-distance calls and each had its own block of ten thousand numbers (the largest that reasonably could fit on a small-town manual cord switchboard with a jack and indicator for each line). In most small villages, many of these numbers would remain unused. In large cities, multiple exchanges were created to cover individual districts or neighbourhoods; each had its own series of distinctive prefixes, and multiple blocks of ten thousand numbers each. The first few digits of a number uniquely identified a village, a town or a neighbourhood of a big city.|$|R

This study attempts {{to look into}} the issues regarding mobile banking services and their possible contribution in financial inclusion in India. With the help of this study author tries to focus those areas where banks can provide these mobile banking services. If this service is adopted in a positive manner it can drastically change the scenario of Financial Inclusion. For a successful financial inclusion i. e., inclusive growth, in this era, combination of both the services i. e., banking as well as mobile is very much required. Mobile banking which can be termed as virtual banking can do wonders for the economy, because these days growth in economy is possible with the help of financial inclusion and in current scenario, statistics reveals that it is very easy with the help of mobile banking. This study has been done in two phases. First phase discusses about awareness of M-banking services and Second phase discusses about possible contribution of mobile banking towards financial inclusion. M-banking in India, as assessed by the govt. can work as a potent tool for financial inclusion, is yet to clear many hurdles before it can fulfill its objective of reaching the unbanked population.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the factors that}} are working for and against {{the development of an}} advanced telecommunications infrastructure to serve rural areas of the USA. There is a notable difference between the costs of local network upgrades for existing <b>rural</b> telephone <b>subscribers</b> and of bringing service to new and physically remote subscribers. The latter group should be treated separately for policy purposes. The infrastructure serving the existing subscriber base could be upgraded to a digital network without necessitating large rate increases, provided there is sharing of network facilities between the energy, transportation and telecommunication sectors. The preferred medium is likely to be digital fibre. ...|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the major}} issues facing the Internet segment in India is the lower average {{bandwidth}} of broadband connections {{compared to that of}} developed countries. According to 2007 statistics, the average download speed in India hovered at about 40 KB per second (256 kbit/s), the minimum speed set by TRAI, whereas the international average was 5.6 Mbit/s during the same period. In order to attend this infrastructure issue the government declared 2007 as [...] "the year of broadband". To compete with international standards of defining broadband speed the Indian Government has taken the aggressive step of proposing a $13 billion national broadband network to connect all cities, towns and villages with a population of more than 500 in two phases targeted for completion by 2012 and 2013. The network was supposed to provide speeds up to 10 Mbit/s in 63 metropolitan areas and 4 Mbit/s in an additional 352 cities. Also, the Internet penetration rate in India is one of the lowest in the world and only accounts for 8.4% of the population compared to the rate in OECD counties, where the average is over 50%. Another issue is the digital divide where growth is biased in favour of urban areas; according to 2010 statistics, more than 75 per cent of the broadband connections in the country are in the top 30 cities. Regulators have tried to boost the growth of broadband in rural areas by promoting higher investment in rural infrastructure and establishing subsidised tariffs for <b>rural</b> <b>subscribers</b> under the Universal service obligation scheme of the Indian government.|$|R

5000|$|Under the {{regulatory}} mechanisms of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, wireless, and long distance carriers (such as AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile US, or Verizon) pay access fees to local exchange carriers (LECs) for calls to those carriers' local <b>subscribers.</b> <b>Rural</b> carriers are {{allowed by the}} FCC to charge substantially higher access fees than carriers in more urban areas, based on the rationale that they must pay for substantial fixed infrastructure costs while handling lower call volume. In order to increase their incoming call volume, and thereby fees owed, rural carriers partner with certain telephone service providers to route their calls through the rural carrier. These services typically include phone sex and conference call providers, which expect a high volume of incoming calls. Notably, these service providers {{do not need to}} establish a physical, local presence in order to route their calls in this way. [...] As a consequence of this arrangement, the rural carriers can receive millions of dollars of fees, which they then share with the ostensibly [...] "local" [...] service providers, who are responsible for vastly increasing call volume above typical rural usage.|$|R
40|$|Maternal {{and infant}} {{mortality}} {{is a global}} health issue with a significant social and economic impact. Each year, over half a million women worldwide die due to complications related to pregnancy or childbirth, four million infants die in the first 28 days of life, and eight million infants die in the first year. Ninety-nine percent of maternal and infant deaths are in developing countries. Reducing maternal and infant mortality is among the key international development goals. In China, the national maternal mortality ratio and infant mortality rate were reduced greatly {{in the past two}} decades, yet a large discrepancy remains between urban and rural areas. To address this problem, a large-scale Safe Motherhood Programme was initiated in 2000. The programme was implemented in Guangxi in 2003. Interventions in the programme included both demand-side and supply side-interventions focusing on increasing health service use and improving birth outcomes. Little is known about the effects and economic outcomes of the Safe Motherhood Programme in Guangxi, although it has been implemented for seven years. The aim of this research is to estimate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the interventions in the Safe Motherhood Programme in Guangxi, China. The objectives of this research include: 1. To evaluate whether the changes of health service use and birth outcomes are associated with the interventions in the Safe Motherhood Programme. 2. To estimate the cost-effectiveness of the interventions in the Safe Motherhood Programme and quantify the uncertainty surrounding the decision. 3. To assess the expected value of perfect information associated with both the whole decision and individual parameters, and interpret the findings to inform priority setting in further research and policy making in this area. A quasi-experimental study design was used in this research to assess the effectiveness of the programme in increasing health service use and improving birth outcomes. The study subjects were 51 intervention counties and 30 control counties. Data on the health service use, birth outcomes and socio-economic factors from 2001 to 2007 were collected from the programme database and statistical yearbooks. Based on the profile plots of the data, general linear mixed models were used {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the programme while controlling for the effects of baseline levels of the response variables, change of socio-economic factors over time and correlations among repeated measurements from the same county. Redundant multicollinear variables were deleted from the mixed model using the results of the multicollinearity diagnoses. For each response variable, the best covariance structure was selected from 15 alternatives according to the fit statistics including Akaike information criterion, Finite-population corrected Akaike information criterion, and Schwarz. s Bayesian information criterion. Residual diagnostics were used to validate the model assumptions. Statistical inferences were made to show the effect of the programme on health service use and birth outcomes. A decision analytic model was developed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the programme, quantify the decision uncertainty, and estimate the expected value of perfect information associated with the decision. The model was used to describe the transitions between health states for women and infants and reflect the change of both costs and health benefits associated with implementing the programme. Result gained from the mixed models and other relevant evidence identified were synthesised appropriately to inform the input parameters of the model. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of the programme were calculated for the two groups of intervention counties over time. Uncertainty surrounding the parameters was dealt with using probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty relating to model assumptions was handled using scenario analysis. Finally the expected value of perfect information for both the whole model and individual parameters in the model were estimated to inform priority setting in further research in this area. The annual change rates of the antenatal care rate and the institutionalised delivery rate were improved significantly in the intervention counties after the programme was implemented. Significant improvements were also found in the annual change rates of the maternal mortality ratio, the infant mortality rate, the incidence rate of neonatal tetanus and the mortality rate of neonatal tetanus in the intervention counties after the implementation of the programme. The annual change rate of the neonatal mortality rate was also improved, although the improvement was only close to statistical significance. The influences of the socio-economic factors on the health service use indicators and birth outcomes were identified. The rural income per capita had a significant positive impact on the health service use indicators, and a significant negative impact on the birth outcomes. The number of beds in healthcare institutions per 1, 000 population and the number of <b>rural</b> telephone <b>subscribers</b> per 1, 000 were found to be positively significantly related to the institutionalised delivery rate. The length of highway per square kilometre negatively influenced the maternal mortality ratio. The percentage of employed persons in the primary industry had a significant negative impact on the institutionalised delivery rate, and a significant positive impact on the infant mortality rate and neonatal mortality rate. The incremental costs of implementing the programme over the existing practice were US $ 11. 1 million from the societal perspective, and US $ 13. 8 million from the perspective of the Ministry of Health. Overall, 28, 711 life years were generated by the programme, producing an overall incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US $ 386 from the societal perspective, and US $ 480 from the perspective of the Ministry of Health, both of which were below the threshold willingness-to-pay ratio of US $ 675. The expected net monetary benefit generated by the programme was US $ 8. 3 million from the societal perspective, and US $ 5. 5 million from the perspective of the Ministry of Health. The overall probability that the programme was cost-effective was 0. 93 and 0. 89 from the two perspectives, respectively. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the programme was insensitive to the different estimates of the three parameters relating to the model assumptions. Further research could be conducted to reduce the uncertainty surrounding the decision, in which the upper limit of investment was US $ 0. 6 million from the societal perspective, and US $ 1. 3 million from the perspective of the Ministry of Health. It is also worthwhile to get a more precise estimate of the improvement of infant mortality rate. The population expected value of perfect information for individual parameters associated with this parameter was US $ 0. 99 million from the societal perspective, and US $ 1. 14 million from the perspective of the Ministry of Health. The findings from this study have shown that the interventions in the Safe Motherhood Programme were both effective and cost-effective in increasing health service use and improving birth outcomes in rural areas of Guangxi, China. Therefore, the programme represents a good public health investment and should be adopted and further expanded to an even broader area if possible. This research provides economic evidence to inform efficient decision making in improving maternal and infant health in developing countries...|$|R
