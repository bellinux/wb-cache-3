25|$|Cradle-to-cradle is a {{specific}} kind of cradle-to-grave assessment, where the end-of-life disposal step for the product is a <b>recycling</b> <b>process.</b> It is a method used to minimize {{the environmental impact of}} products by employing sustainable production, operation, and disposal practices and aims to incorporate social responsibility into product development. From the <b>recycling</b> <b>process</b> originate new, identical products (e.g., asphalt pavement from discarded asphalt pavement, glass bottles from collected glass bottles), or different products (e.g., glass wool insulation from collected glass bottles).|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{study the effects of}} {{different}} simulated mechanical <b>recycling</b> <b>processes</b> on the structure and properties of PLA. A commercial grade of PLA was melt compounded and compression molded, then subjected to two different <b>recycling</b> <b>processes,</b> one of them comprising an accelerated aging and a second melt compounding and compression molding step, and other which included a demanding washing step after the accelerated aging process. The intrinsic viscosity measurements indicate that both <b>recycling</b> <b>processes</b> produce a degradation in PLA, which is more pronounced in the sample subjected to the washing process. DSC results suggest an increase in the mobility of the polymer chains in the recycled materials, however the degree of crystallinity of PLA seems unchanged. The optical, mechanical and gas barrier properties of PLA {{do not seem to be}} largely affected by the degradation suffered during the different <b>recycling</b> <b>processes.</b> These results suggest that, despite the degradation of PLA, the impact of the different simulated mechanical <b>recycling</b> <b>processes</b> on the final properties is limited. Thus, the potential use of recycled PLA in packaging applications is not jeopardized...|$|R
40|$|Over {{three hundred}} {{thousand}} battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) are currently registered in the United States (US) as of 2015, which is {{less than one percent}} of the total market share. An expected increase for electric vehicles (EV), half of all vehicles sold in the US are expected to be EVs by 2020, will inevitably lead to a high number of EV batteries reaching their end-of-life (EOL). Manufacturers must to create processes to ensure a sustainable management system in order to fulfill government recycling regulations while assuming environmental friendly <b>processes.</b> <b>Recycling</b> used EV batteries presents unique economical and ecological challenges, considering the increased volume, diversity of car batteries, and the lack of a generalizable disposal processes. Especially, the sustainable aspect of <b>recycling</b> <b>processes</b> for EV batteries currently lacks assessment, in order to establish a more environmental friendly and economical efficient process for battery recyclers. ^ Sustainability’s so-called triple bottom line is based on the three factors: humans, economy, and the environment. This study investigates the different <b>recycling</b> <b>processes</b> for EV lithium-ion batteries (LIB) and the associated environmental impacts and economical aspects. In order to generate the data required for an Input-Process- Output (I-P-O) model of the different processes, companies who recycle LIBs were identified. An environmental assessment of the <b>recycling</b> <b>processes</b> was performed using Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) executed via Umberto NXT LCA. ^ The LCA explores the comparability of the disposal processes for LIBs and quantifies the process value regarding the ecological impact with regards to the global warming potential (GWP), the human toxicity potential (HTP), and the terrestrial ecotoxicity potential (TETP). In terms of environmental effects, this paper identified processes that utilize low temperatures, and are able to recover both plastics and lithium as most beneficial processes. To contrast the economical perspective of the different industrialized <b>recycling</b> <b>processes</b> a comparison matrix was created. The most commonly recovered materials are copper, nickel, and cobalt, which are also the materials with the highest value per tonne of spent LIBs. After determining the profit of the different <b>recycling</b> <b>processes,</b> by evaluating the system inputs and outputs, the processes could be rated. Overall, five <b>recycling</b> <b>processes,</b> involving mechanical-, hydro-, and pyrometallurgical treatment, from five companies were compared. Overall, this paper suggests to utilize <b>recycling</b> <b>processes</b> based on pyro- and hydrometallurgical process steps are suggested, contrasting both, environmental and economical aspects. ...|$|R

25|$|One {{approach}} {{to address the}} problem of waste PVC is also through the process called Vinyloop. It is a mechanical <b>recycling</b> <b>process</b> using a solvent to separate PVC from other materials. This solvent turns in a closed loop process in which the solvent is recycled. Recycled PVC is used in place of virgin PVC in various applications: coatings for swimming pools, shoe soles, hoses, diaphragms tunnel, coated fabrics, PVC sheets. This recycled PVC's primary energy demand is 46 percent lower than conventional produced PVC. So the use of recycled material leads to a significant better ecological footprint. The global warming potential is 39 percent lower.|$|E

(This sealing button is sometimes mistakenly identified as a pontil mark. However, no pontil (or punty) was used in the process of blowing glass floats.) While floats were still hot and soft, marks were often embossed on or near the sealing button to identify the float for trademark. These marks sometimes included kanji symbols.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} actions along the {{recycling}} supply chain that can influence and affect the material quality of recyclate. It {{begins with the}} waste producers who place non-target and non-recyclable wastes in recycling collection. This can {{affect the quality of}} final recyclate streams or require further efforts to discard those materials at later stages in the <b>recycling</b> <b>process.</b> The different collection systems can result in different levels of contamination. Depending on which materials are collected together, extra effort is required to sort this material back into separate streams and can significantly reduce the quality of the final product. Transportation and the compaction of materials can {{make it more difficult to}} separate material back into separate waste streams. Sorting facilities are not one hundred per cent effective in separating materials, despite improvements in technology and quality recyclate which can see a loss in recyclate quality. The storage of materials outside where the product can become wet can cause problems for re-processors. Reprocessing facilities may require further sorting steps to further reduce the amount of non-target and non-recyclable material. Each action along the recycling path plays a part in the quality of recyclate.|$|E
25|$|Although {{consumer}} electronics {{such as the}} television have been popular since the 1920s, recycling of them was almost unheard of until early 1991. The first electronic waste recycling scheme was implemented in Switzerland, beginning with collection of old refrigerators but gradually expanding to cover all devices. After these schemes were set up, many countries {{did not have the}} capacity to deal with the sheer quantity of e-waste they generated or its hazardous nature. They began to export the problem to developing countries without enforced environmental legislation. This is cheaper, as recycling computer monitors in the United States costs 10 times more than in China. Demand in Asia for electronic waste began to grow when scrap yards found that they could extract valuable substances such as copper, silver, iron, silicon, nickel, and gold, during the <b>recycling</b> <b>process.</b> The 2000s saw a large increase in both the sale of electronic devices and their growth as a waste stream: in 2002, e-waste grew faster than any other type of waste in the EU. This caused investment in modern, automated facilities to cope with the influx of redundant appliances, especially after strict laws were implemented in 2003.|$|E

The main objective of this work is to study the effect of different mechanical <b>recycling</b> <b>processes</b> on the hydrolytic degradation of PLA. A commercial grade of PLA was subjected to two different <b>recycling</b> <b>processes,</b> one of them comprising an accelerated thermal and photochemical aging and a second melt compounding and compression molding step, and other including a demanding washing step after the accelerated aging process.

The water absorption process, at both temperatures, can be modeled using a Fickian model only when the immersion times were short. The different <b>recycling</b> <b>processes</b> caused an increase of the diffusion coefficient of PLA at 37 °C, while at 58 °C the differences were smaller.
