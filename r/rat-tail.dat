50|$|The son of {{the great}} dragon Mim, The Great Red Dragon is often Fone Bone's last-minute savior. The Red Dragon appears when he is most needed. Gran'ma Ben does not trust him, {{regardless}} of {{how many times he}} has saved her or her friends from harm. The Great Red Dragon seems to be incredibly ancient. In a sequence that shows the land during the Dragons' reign, supposedly the beginning of time, the Great Red Dragon can be seen fighting Mim along with other dragons. As said in the prequel Stupid, Stupid Rat Tails, he is Mim's son and {{he was part of the}} group that trapped her in stone when the Valley was made. He took care of Thorn during the Great War while Rose searched for a place for them to hide. He is also seen at the end of Stupid, Stupid <b>Rat-tails</b> during the time of Boneville's founding by Big Johnson Bone. Fone Bone indicates that he has a baritone voice.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The falls {{of large}} whales (30 – 160 t adult body weight) yield massive pulses of labile organic {{matter to the}} deep-sea floor. While {{scientists}} have long speculated on the ecological roles of such concentrated food inputs, observations have accumulated since the 1850 s to suggest that deep-sea whale falls support a widespread, characteristic fauna. Interest in whale-fall ecology heightened with the discovery in 1989 of a chemoautotrophic assemblage on a whale skeleton in the northeast Pacific; related communities were soon reported from whale falls in other bathyal and abyssal Pacific and Atlantic sites, and from 30 mya (million years ago) in the northeast Pacific fossil record. Recent time-series studies of natural and implanted deep-sea whale falls off California, USA indicate that bathyal carcasses pass through at least three successional stages: (1) a mobile-scavenger stage lasting months to years, during which aggregations of sleeper sharks, hagfish, <b>rat-tails</b> and invertebrate scavengers remove whale soft tissue at high rates (40 – 60 kgd 1); (2) an enrichment opportunist stage (duration of months to years) during which organi-cally enriched sediments and exposed bones are colonised by dense assemblages (u...|$|R

40|$|After {{completing}} my Bachelors degree, I knew I was not {{destined for}} the business career it was assumed I would follow.

I was ready to learn how {{to make a difference in}} both community development and natural resource conservation……. A Community Development Story: Once upon a time, a development office helped build grain storage sheds in a community. Field workers observed rats getting into the sheds and spoke with the villagers about killing the rats. The villagers did not believe it was worth the effort. The agency staff decided to give a small fee for each dead rat as an incentive to kill them. So, people began killing rats and getting paid by the office. With more and more rats killed, the agency allowed the villagers to bring only the rat’s tail for payment. Again, there was an increase in the number of rats killed and the agency staff was perplexed. Eventually, one development worker observed <b>rat-tails</b> that looked alike. He returned to the village t...|$|R
60|$|But {{the plants}} which would strike a {{botanist}} most, I think, {{the first time}} he found himself on a tropic burn-side, are the peppers, groves of tall herbs some ten feet high or more, utterly unlike any European plants I have ever seen. Some {219a} have round leaves, peltate, that is, with the footstalk springing from inside the circumference, like a one-sided umbrella. They catch the eye at once, from the great size of their leaves, each a full foot across; but they are hardly as odd and foreign-looking as the more abundant forms of peppers, {219b} usually so soft and green that they look as if you might make them into salad, stalks and all, yet with a quaint stiffness and primness, given by the regular jointing of their knotted stalks, and the regular tiling of their pointed, drooping, strong-nerved leaves, which are usually, to add to the odd look of the plant, all crooked, one side of the base (and that in each species always the same side) being much larger than the other, so that the whole head of the bush seems to have got a twist from right to left, or left to right. Nothing can look more unlike than they to the climbing true peppers, or even to the creeping pepper-weeds, which abound in all waste land. But their <b>rat-tails</b> of small green flowers prove them to be peppers nevertheless.|$|R

After the Bones' first encounter with Roque Ja, Bartleby returns to the fold of the Rat Creatures, though is out of place there {{and returns to the}} Bones later after growing a little. He became a good friend to Smiley and when they left for Boneville, he went with them. Bartleby was named by Shaenon K. Garrity, for the title character in the short story [...] "Bartleby, the Scrivener" [...] by Herman Melville. Unlike the other Rat Creatures, Bartleby has round ears. He explains that the Rat Creatures are supposed to get their ears cropped and that he ran away before they could do that to him. Bartleby also explains that the first time he ran away from the Rat Creatures was after he got his tail chopped off. He states that all Rat Creatures are born with beautiful, long, hairless tails, but all the Rat Creature cubs have their tails chopped off around the time they turn one year old. This is due to their belief that a sort of boogie man named 'The Jekk' will drag them away in their sleep by their tails. In the prequel book Stupid, Stupid, <b>Rat-Tails,</b> we learn that the Bone cousins' forefather 'Big Johnson Bone' is the fabled boogie man they fear, having come to the Valley hundreds of years earlier and fighting the Rat Creatures by swinging them around by their tails. In a sequence depicting the land during the Dragons' rule, Rat Creatures with long tails {{can be seen in the}} distance.|$|R

60|$|In one of {{the long}} line of boxes the Ambler was {{awaiting}} his toilette, a dark-brown horse, about sixteen hands, with well-placed shoulders, straight hocks, a small head, and what is known as a <b>rat-tail.</b> But of all his features, the most remarkable was his eye. In the depths of that full, soft eye was an almost uncanny gleam, and when he turned it, half-circled by a moon of white, and gave bystanders that look of strange comprehension, they felt that he saw to the bottom of all this that was going on around him. He was still but three years old, and had not yet attained the age when people apply to action the fruits of understanding; yet there was little doubt that as he advanced in years he would manifest his disapproval of a system whereby men made money at his expense. And with that eye half-circled by the moon he looked at George, and in silence George looked back at him, strangely baffled by the horse's long, soft, wild gaze. On this heart beating deep within its warm, dark satin sheath, on the spirit gazing through that soft, wild eye, too much was hanging, and he turned away.|$|E
40|$|To {{formulate}} {{more accurate}} guidelines for musculoskeletal disorders (MSD) linked to Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS), delineation {{of the response}} of bone tissue under different frequencies and duration of vibration needs elucidation. <b>Rat-tails</b> were vibrated at 12522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 026 Hz (9 rats) and 25022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 026 Hz (9 rats), at 49 m/s(2), for 1 D (6 rats), 5 D (6 rats) and 20 D (6 rats); D=days (422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 026 h/d). Rats {{in the control group}} (6 rats for the vibration groups; 2 each for 1 D, 5 D, and 20 D) were left in their cages, without being subjected to any vibration. Structural and biochemical damages were quantified using empty lacunae count and nitrotyrosine signal-intensity, respectively. One-way repeated-measure mixed-model ANOVA at p< 0. 05 level of significance was used for analysis. In the cortical bone, structural damage quantified through empty lacunae count was significant (p< 0. 05) at 25022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 026 Hz (10. 82 21 0. 66) in comparison to the control group (7. 41 21 0. 76). The biochemical damage was significant (p< 0. 05) at both the 12522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 026 Hz and 25022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 026 Hz vibration frequencies. The structural damage was significant (p< 0. 05) at 5 D for cortical bone while the trabecular bone showed significant (p< 0. 05) damage at 20 D time point. Further, the biochemical damage increased with increase in the duration of vibration with a significant (p< 0. 05) damage observed at 20 D time point and a near significant change (p= 0. 08) observed at 5 D time point. Structural and biochemical changes in bone tissue are dependent upon higher vibration frequencies of 12522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 026 Hz, 25022 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 026 Hz and the duration of vibration (5 D, 20 D).

6000|$|Take as {{an example}} that into which we rowed that day in Monos, as the old Spaniards named it, from monkeys long since extinct; a curved shingle beach some fifty yards across, shut in right and left by steep rocks wooded down almost to the sea, and worn into black caves and crannies, festooned with the night-blowing Cereus, which crawls about with hairy green legs, like a tangle of giant spiders. [...] Among it, in the cracks, upright Cerei, like {{candelabra}} twenty and thirty feet high, thrust themselves aloft into the brushwood. An Aroid {103b} rides parasitic on roots and stems, sending downward long air-roots, and upward brown <b>rat-tails</b> of flower, and broad leaves, four feet by two, which wither into whity-brown paper, and are used, being tough and fibrous, to wrap round the rowlocks of the oars. Tufts of Karatas, top, spread their long prickly leaves among the bush of 'rastrajo,' or second growth after the primeval forest has been cleared, which dips suddenly right and left to the beach. [...] It, and the little strip of flat ground behind it, hold a three- roomed cottage--of course on stilts; a shed {{which serves as a}} kitchen; a third ruined building, which is tenanted mostly by lizards and creeping flowers; some twenty or thirty coconut trees; and on {{the very edge of the}} sea an almond-tree, its roots built up to seaward with great stones, its trunk hung with fishing lines; and around it, scattered on the shingle, strange shells, bits of coral, coconuts and their fragments; almonds from the tree; the round scaly fruit of the Mauritia palm, which has probably floated across the gulf from the forests of the Orinoco or the Caroni; and the long seeds of the mangrove, in shape like a roach-fisher's float, and already germinating, their leaves showing at the upper end, a tiny root at the lower. In that shingle they will not take root: but they are quite ready to go to sea again next tide, and wander on for weeks, and for hundreds of miles, till they run ashore at last on a congenial bed of mud, throw out spider legs right and left, and hide the foul mire with their gay green leaves.|$|R

His regimental coat of German blue, gorgeously {{decorated}} with a goodly show of large brass buttons, reaching from his waistband to his chin; the voluminous skirts turned up at the corners, and separating gallantly behind, so as to display the seat of a sumptuous pair of brimstone-colored trunk-breeches, a graceful style still prevalent among the warriors of our day, and which is in conformity to the custom of ancient heroes, who scorned to defend themselves in rear.
