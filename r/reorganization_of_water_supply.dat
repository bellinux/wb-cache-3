The biggest of them, the Fernando de Noronha island, is <b>supplied</b> in domestic <b>water</b> by two reservoirs, one rain-water collecting system and another system using sea water desalinization. In addition, this island is <b>supplied</b> by <b>water</b> from six secondary artificial ponds and some wells and springs. However, {{during the summer}} drought time, the island endures a <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> reduction that endangers the touristic activities, which are the main economical local financial source. In this concern, were evaluated the quality <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> from several sources for human supplying.

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 Written on Running Water: Ovidian Poetics in the Roman Waterscape {{analyzes}} the symbolic value <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in Ovid’s poetry and considers how this {{was affected by}} the <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> the Roman <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> under Augustus. Agrippa and Augustus gained enormous political capital by restructuring and coordinating the city’s hydraulic infrastructure, and they altered the Roman landscape and the cultural significance <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{in ways that would}} profoundly influence the building programmes and self-promotion of later emperors. I show that the abundance and beauty of the city’s new waterscape also affected Ovid’s use of images such as the fountain of inspiration and the locus amoenus, and came to represent the ideal aquatic environment. Taking a broad view <b>of</b> Ovid’s <b>water</b> poetics, I examine his depictions of Roman hydraulic infrastructure, his representations <b>of</b> <b>water</b> systems outside <b>of</b> the city, and the transformative <b>waters</b> <b>of</b> the Metamorphoses which challenge human attempts to control nature. Throughout his oeuvre, Ovid harnesses the power <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to figure his life and his poetic activity. I show that the basis for these images {{can be found in the}} newly transformed waterscape of the city of Rome...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} the characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> infrastructure in Lubaczów. Thereafter the analysis <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> infrastructure {{based on the}} collected operational data was performed. Indicators characterizing the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> infrastructure in the years 1995 - 2014 were determined. In the analysis the following parameters were used: length <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network, the number <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> connections, <b>water</b> consumption. The analysis was based on data get from the Central Statistical Office for 1995 ÷ 2014 [4]. The increase in the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network in Lubaczów in the considered period amounted 125, 8 %, while the average increase in the length <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network was 0, 3 km/year, per one inhabitant falls 1, 87 - 2, 38 m <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network. The value of the load intensity <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> system in the Podkarpackie region in the years 1995 - 2009, as opposed to Lubaczów, showed an increasing trend.

40|$|The {{recommendations}} {{for the development of}} additional regulatory requirements to reliability <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> systems in Vietnam are offered. In current construction rules for design, the reliability <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> systems <b>of</b> <b>water</b> facilities is not standardized. Water systems are classified into three categories, for which the conditions for performing functions in the process <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> for consumers are formulated. It is not provided to assess the quality of these functions quantitatively. Adoption of design decisions without quantitative assessment of their quality is violating a systematic approach in carrying out construction and design works, which has formed in the global practice. As a result of the research <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> facilities’ reliability in Vietnam and Russia, the reliability <b>of</b> the existing <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> facilities has been estimated. On the basis of mathematical methods for assessing the reliability of technical objects, the methods for assessing the reliability <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> facilities and their systems has been justified and systematized. If there is lack of reliability and security requirements to the object of capital construction for design documentation development or such requirements are not established, the development and approval in the prescribed manner of special specifications should precede the documentation development. It is proposed to systematize the statistical data gathering on the reliability of the equipment and facilities <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> systems by uniform rules. Any designed objects <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> must have a quantitative estimate of the level of reliability. The outlined methods for assessing the reliability <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> facilities and systems can be used in the formation of regulatory requirements for reliability in the design <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> facilities in Vietnam...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Livestock {{sector is}} one of the major {{consumers}} <b>of</b> <b>water</b> at the national level. Most <b>of</b> the <b>water</b> <b>supplying</b> the livestock sector originates from groundwater. Accessing groundwater is through borehole drilling. This makes water to be the most expensive factor input in the livestock sector. The cost <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> to livestock sector is influenced by climatic factors particularly temperature and rainfall. These climatic variables influnce per capita daily water demand and livestock drinking behaviour at the boreholes, respectively. Through these linkages, climate change might affect the cost <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> for the livestock sector. In the study, we assess the impacts of climate change on cost <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> to the livestock sector. Using a system approach, a model is developed driven by temperature and rainfall. To assess the impacts of climate change, climate scenarios for rainfall and temperature for 2050 were constructed.

The management <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> and maintenance <b>of</b> these infrastructures are managed by a committee of residents who live in each RW. During 2 years, there are changes in quality and quantity <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The quality <b>of</b> <b>water</b> is not good as {{the first year of}} use and the quantity is in sufficient. The method of this research is descriptive qualitative which analyses the performance <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> service, the performance of exploitation and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> infrastruction, the performance <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> infrastruction, and the costumer satisfaction <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> service. After analysing these performances, they are than compared with the performance <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> infrastructure’s exploitation and maintenance between Perumahan Permata’s and Kedung Mendeng’s. The result shows that the performance of RW 14 Perumahan Permata is better than RW 03 Kedung Mendeng’s. However, based on that performance criteria RW. 14 Perumahan Permata’s is not perfect yet. Based on the performance <b>of</b> <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> infrastructures criteria, RW 14 Perumahan Permata is better than RW 03 Kedung Mendeng’s Performance.
