50|$|As {{part of the}} Australian Commonwealth {{series of}} six postage stamps issued between 1959 and 1962 she {{designed}} the platypus for the one-shilling stamp and was awarded the Vizard-Wholohan Prize for prints in 1962. Other stamps in the series feature the kangaroo, banded anteater, tiger cat, <b>rabbit</b> <b>bandicoot</b> and the Tasmanian tiger (now believed extinct). This stamp series is significant as {{it was one of}} the earliest attempts at putting Australian flora and fauna on stamps. In addition {{it was one of the}} first times that a designer further commercialised their designs by producing poster versions of the stamp artwork and made them available for sale. This series, the first to be designed by a woman, were for the Postmaster-General's Department now called Australia Post. Mayo produced many stamp and poster designs depicting the flora and fauna of Australia.|$|E
50|$|The owls hunt at night, {{preying on}} a wide range of animals, from insects to mammals as large as <b>rabbits,</b> <b>bandicoots</b> and brushtail possums. The main diet {{includes}} introduced rodents and rabbits in agricultural areas, and marsupials and native birds in less disturbed habitats. They often hunt from perches using sound to detect prey, which is usually taken on the ground by striking with the feet and using the talons to pierce and kill.|$|R
5000|$|Caladenia viridescens is {{classified}} as [...] "Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora â€” Extant)" [...] by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife and as [...] "Endangered" [...] (EN) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The main threats to the species are weed invasion and grazing and digging by mammals including <b>rabbits,</b> kangaroos, <b>bandicoots</b> and livestock.|$|R
50|$|The fauna of the Sydney area is {{diverse and}} its urban area {{is home to}} variety of bird and insect species, and also a few bat, {{arachnid}} and amphibian species. Introduced birds such as the house sparrow, common myna and feral pigeon are ubiquitous in the CBD areas of Sydney. Moreover, possums, <b>bandicoots,</b> <b>rabbits,</b> feral cats, lizards, snakes and frogs may also {{be present in the}} urban environment, albeit seldom in city centers.|$|R
50|$|The Australian masked owl inhabits timbered areas, {{often with}} a shrub understorey. In Australia they are seldom found more than 300 km inland. They roost and nest in large tree hollows near {{foraging}} areas. They are nocturnal and their prey includes rodents, small dasyurids, possums, <b>bandicoots,</b> <b>rabbits,</b> bats, birds, reptiles and insects. Foraging is primarily for terrestrial prey, however some prey is taken from the trees or in flight. The population of the Australian masked owl on the mainland is declining and several states have this owl on the Species Conservation Status list. They are territorial and may remain {{in the same area}} once they have established a breeding territory.|$|R
40|$|For humans, strong {{evidence}} indicates that some mucosal papillomavirus (PV) types cause genital and oral neoplasia, and weaker evidence suggests that some cutaneous PVs may cause cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). For nonhuman species, {{strong evidence}} supports a causal role of PVs {{in the development of}} feline and equine sarcoids. Likewise, PVs are believed to cause cutaneous SCCs in <b>rabbits,</b> western barred <b>bandicoots,</b> and some rodents. Furthermore, some evidence suggests that PVs may influence the development of both feline and canine cutaneous SCCs. This review discusses the evidence that PVs cause human cutaneous SCCs and the proposed mechanisms for this action. It then reviews preneoplastic and neoplastic skin diseases that are associated with PV infection in nonhuman mammals...|$|R
40|$|The western barred {{bandicoot}} was reintroduced to the Australian mainland in 1995 {{after an}} absence of at least 60 years. The new population was derived from 14 animals, reintroduced to Heirisson Prong from Dorre Island in Shark Bay, Western Australia. Introduced predators (the European red fox and the feral cat) were controlled at the reintroduction site, but European rabbits were not. A large fenced area of natural vegetation within the reintroduction site {{was used as a}} secure refuge from mammalian predators. Bandicoots were released from this predator refuge to the 12 km 2 conservation site. Dispersal from the point of free release was minimal. The reintroduced population has persisted for 4 years and increased, with at least 175 bandicoots recruited to the population in this time. The recapture rate of marked bandicoots was low, suggesting that adult mortality was high. Reproductive output at Heirisson Prong appeared greater than that of the two surviving wild populations on Bernier and Dorre Islands. Litter size was similar, but there was an extended annual breeding season at the reintroduction site. Body condition of reintroduced and wild bandicoots were similar, although there was some indication that reintroduced males may have been in poorer condition than their island counterparts. The litter size of bandicoots increased with a decrease in <b>rabbit</b> abundance, however, <b>bandicoots</b> were able to reproduce, maintain condition, and sustain recruitment to allow the population to increase despite the presence of rabbits. Two fox incursions occurred during the 4 -year period of establishment, and feral cats were present on occasion in low numbers. Feral cats may be responsible for a lower rate of population increase than that observed on predator-free Dorre Island. Ongoing predator control is essential for any mainland reintroduction of bandicoots...|$|R
