5|$|According to {{contemporary}} Frankish scholar and courtier Einhard, Eric was killed at Trsat (Tarsatch), a {{town on the}} coast of Liburnia by the treachery of the inhabitants. Due to a lack of primary materials, it is uncertain who killed Duke Eric. Most of historians point at Croats, while some point at Byzantines. Einhard also notes the death of Gerold, Prefect of Bavaria, another Frankish commander who was slain in Pannonia in the same year. Croatian historian Nenad Labus <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> event as a successful assassination attempt by Avars and Slavs. Historian Pierre Riché believes that Dalmatian Croats (Guduscani) killed Eric in collusion with Avars.|$|E
5|$|French naturalist Georges Cuvier {{originally}} {{described the}} yellow stingray as Raia jamaicensis in 1816, in Le Règne Animal distribué d'après son organisation pour servir de base à l'histoire naturelle des animaux et d'introduction à l'anatomie comparée. He based his account on specimens obtained from Jamaica, though no type specimens were designated. Subsequent authors moved this species to the genus Urolophus, {{and then to}} the genus Urobatis (some literature still <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> species as Urolophus jamaicensis). Other common names used for this ray include the yellow-spotted ray, the round ray, and the maid ray.|$|E
5|$|Thallium(I) bromide and thallium(I) iodide {{crystals}} {{have been}} used as infrared optical materials, because they are harder than other common infrared optics, and because they have transmission at significantly longer wavelengths. The trade name KRS-5 <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> material. Thallium(I) oxide has been used to manufacture glasses that have a high index of refraction. Combined with sulfur or selenium and arsenic, thallium has been used in the production of high-density glasses that have low melting points in the range of 125 and 150 °C. These glasses have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable, insoluble in water and have unique refractive indices.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} a Powers Picture Plays {{directed}} by Edwin August and {{distributed by the}} Universal Film Manufacturing Company. The film's production number was 0101. The screen play was written by Jeanie MacPherson who also {{played the role of}} The Girl. Simon Louvish, author of Cecil B. DeMille: A Life in Art, states this uncredited screenplay {{was the first one to}} be authored by MacPherson. Louvish also <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> film as a two-reeler. Lon Chaney and Robert Z. Leonard had previously worked together for the Ferris Hartman Troupe. Three years prior to the release of the film, the two were involved in the production of musical comedies for the Troupe. In 1918, Leonard would later direct his wife, Mae Murry, and Lon Chaney in Danger, Go Slow.|$|E

25|$|The green {{anaconda}} (Eunectes murinus), {{also known}} as the common anaconda and water boa, is a non-venomous boa species found in South America. It is the heaviest and one of the longest known extant snake species. The term anaconda often <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> species, though the term could also apply to other members of the genus Eunectes.|$|E

Early British explorer, John Whitehead who had explored North Borneo in the 1880s <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> district as Patatan.

25|$|Some {{languages}} (e.g., German, Italian, and French), {{have multiple}} morphological classes of inchoative verbs. Generally speaking, these languages separate their inchoative verbs into three classes: verbs that are obligatorily unmarked (they are not {{marked with a}} reflexive pronoun, clitic, or affix), verbs that are optionally marked, and verbs that are obligatorily marked. The causative verbs in these languages remain unmarked. Haspelmath <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> as the anticausative alternation.|$|E

Somoza, in his memoirs, <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> action as the beginning of a sharp escalation in terms of Sandinista attacks and government reprisals. Martial law was declared in 1975, and the National Guard began to raze villages in the jungle suspected of supporting the rebels. Human rights groups condemned the actions, but U.S. President Gerald Ford refused to break the U.S. alliance with Somoza.|$|E

25|$|Causative morphemes {{are present}} in the verbs of many {{languages}} (e.g., Tagalog, Malagasy, Turkish, etc.), usually appearing {{in the form of an}} affix on the verb. This can be seen in the following examples from Tagalog, where the causative prefix pag- (realized here as nag) attaches to the verb tumba to derive a causative transitive verb in (7b), but the prefix does not appear in the inchoative intransitive verb in (7a). Haspelmath <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> as the causative alternation.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} case-hardened part {{may show}} distinct surface discoloration, if the carbon material is mixed organic matter as described above. The steel darkens significantly, and shows a mottled pattern of black, blue and purple, {{caused by the}} various compounds formed from impurities in the bone and charcoal. This oxide surface works similarly to bluing, providing a degree of corrosion resistance, {{as well as an}} attractive finish. Case colouring <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> pattern and is commonly encountered as a decorative finish on firearms.|$|E

Keres, in his autobiographical games collection, <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> major event as a 'Candidates' Tournament', and claimed that he was recognized as a Grandmaster after winning it, although its parallel connection with later FIDE-organized Candidates' tournaments (from 1950 onwards) is not exact, and the Grandmaster title was not formalized by FIDE until 1950.|$|E
