5|$|A sequel titled , was {{released}} in Japan on 29 December 2011, with an official English patch being released a year later on Christmas Day. The game is an episodic followup set around the holiday season and {{takes place in a}} separate universe from the first game, in which the events of Bad Boys Love do not occur. The sequel, developed largely alongside the first game, makes reference to and explores several unresolved plot elements brought up in the first game's Bad Boys Love scenario that could not be fully addressed in its main narrative. Unlike the first game, Holiday Star is a mostly linear visual novel rather than an otome game, with more standalone scenarios and fewer branching plotlines.
