5|$|John Baldwin was {{a person}} whose views seemed to <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> the {{conventional}} customs of the time. Despite his accomplishments, he never wrote a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although {{he was not an}} abolitionist by definition, he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals, as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender. His parents taught him to fear God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E
5|$|John Bellinger III, {{who served}} as the U.S. State Department's senior lawyer during President George W.

The assassination prohibition does not apply to killings in self-defense.|$|E
5|$|While {{camouflage}} tricks are {{in principle}} limitless, both cost and practical considerations limit {{the choice of}} methods and {{the time and effort}} devoted to camouflage. Paint and uniforms must also protect vehicles and soldiers from the elements. Units need to move, fire their weapons and perform other tasks to keep functional, some of which <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> camouflage. Camouflage may be dropped altogether. Late in the Second World War, the USAAF abandoned camouflage paint for some aircraft to lure enemy fighters to attack, while in the Cold War, some aircraft similarly flew with polished metal skins, to reduce drag and weight, or to reduce vulnerability to radiation from nuclear weapons.|$|E

25|$|Several {{experimental}} findings seem to <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> two-factor theory. For example, avoidance behavior often extinguishes {{very slowly}} {{even when the}} initial CS-US pairing never occurs again, so the fear response {{might be expected to}} extinguish (see Classical conditioning). Further, animals that have learned to avoid often show little evidence of fear, suggesting that escape from fear is not necessary to maintain avoidance behavior.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) {{clarified}} {{the criteria}} for the funding of community development programs by the Catholic Campaign for Human Development. One criterion was exclusion of organizations advancing activities that <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> Catholic teaching, examples of which included those that support or promote same-sex marriage or discrimination. In 2016, the President and the Chair of USCCB denounced US Vice President Joe Biden for officiating at the wedding of a same-sex couple, arguing that Catholic politicians should only do what is expressly in line with Catholic Church teaching.|$|E

25|$|Given {{that the}} American plan for waging the Laotian Civil War was a {{defensive}} one, the American ambassador had <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> policy by approving an offensive drive. This provoked {{a reaction from}} his superiors. The short notice request for additional USAF tactical air support had brought about a directive on 18 August that requests for tactical air support for a planned operation had to be submitted at least ten days in advance. In reality, the process would take 20 to 30 days. The directive, issued by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and agreed to by both the CIA and the State Department, required coordination of planned operations with both 7th Air Force and CINCPAC. These requirements were meant to limit offensives {{under the guise of}} coordination.|$|E
25|$|Further {{delay was}} {{encountered}} in 2008, {{due to a}} disagreement between the three federal agencies that must approve the memorial. The memorial design that {{was approved by the}} CFA and the NCPC was not approved by the NPS, due to security concerns. The NPS insisted upon the inclusion of a barrier that would prevent a vehicle from crashing into the memorial area. However, when the original design was submitted to the other two agencies, including such a barrier, the CFA and the NCPC rejected the barrier as being restrictive in nature, which would <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> King's philosophy of freedom and openness. Eventually, a compromise was reached, which involved the use of landscaping to make the security barriers appear less intrusive upon the area. The compromise plan was approved in October 2009, clearing the way for construction of the memorial to begin.|$|E

25|$|Lienhard’s {{keen sense}} of {{observation}} {{was not limited to}} outward features, but involved his heart and mind as well. Although he respected the indigenous people from the start as the natives of the land, his early comments are not free from the typical ethnocentric views of the whites. Gradually his perspective changed, especially during his stay at Mimal on the Yuba River, where he lived for six months in isolation from white settlers and in close contact with the indigenous peoples of the surrounding villages. Some gathered regularly at his house, observed his activities with interest, traded, or occasionally helped with garden work. They taught him to become a first-rate archer, now and then took him along to their families, and nursed him back to health when he fell ill. Thus Lienhard began to observe their daily life and marveled at their skill in basketry, hunting and fishing. He often joined them in those pursuits and describes their methods of procuring and preparing food. His observations led him to understand that these people had organized their style of life in creative symbiosis with their surroundings, that their customs, though different, were ingenious, and that assessing them from a culturally biased vantage point did not do them justice. His growing understanding was extraordinary and increasingly <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> the then dominant views. One night in the winter of 1848–49, he overheard his young Indian herdsmen talking of the times before the whites had invaded their valleys and of the ever worsening conditions. “The subdued talk of the Indians caused me to ponder,” he wrote. “In my thoughts I tried to put myself in the position of the Indians; and I wondered whether I would acquiesce if I were driven out of my and my ancestors’ homeland as had been the fate of the poor Indians. I confess that I was overwhelmed by strong feelings of revenge, always coming to the conclusion that I would take revenge on the shameless, greedy invaders in every possible way.” He knew from first-hand experience, however, that cooperation, escape, or resistance could all mean death for indigenous people.|$|E
25|$|In Japan, {{especially}} within conservative {{media outlets}} (the most vocal ones being Sankei Shimbun and Bungei Shunju), {{it is argued}} that countries which oppose commercial whaling altogether should not be in the IWC at all and allege that the anti-whaling side has subverted the purpose of the IWC by exploiting the (lack of) membership requirements. Moreover, they point out that the anti-whaling lobby within the IWC are also led by wealthy developed nations and are equally susceptible to accusations of vote-buying and influence-peddling. The anti-whaling side within IWC are accused of using conservation as a cover for their ideological opposition to whaling itself, which mirrors the accusation from the anti-whaling side that Japan's scientific whaling is a cover for commercial whaling. Since 2000, 29 new countries have joined the IWC, 18 of them pro-whaling, 11 anti. Japan notes that major anti-whaling nations such as the U.S. Australia, UK and New Zealand also donate aid to poor countries on the IWC and wield far more influence than Japan alone and thus they could easily be accused of the same tactics. Moreover, Japan is pushing to have secret ballot voting. Had the allegations of vote-buying been true, such proposal would <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> its alleged objective because it is impossible to monitor so called client members' vote. From Japan's point of view, secret ballot voting {{is the only way to}} counter the influence pedling of anti whaling side which Japan see as having more powerful collective influence within the IWC. One of the new 2006 members, Israel, voted consistently with the anti-whaling bloc, was asked specifically to join by the US. Belize, a country previously accused of having their vote bought and paid for by Japan by a number of countries and NGO's, shifted side and consistently voted with the anti-whaling block at the 2006 IWC meeting. Anti-whaling nations oppose secret ballot voting on the grounds that it is without precedent in other international bodies and would have removed accountability and made behind-the-scenes deals between delegations more likely. St Kitts and Nevis Commissioner, Cedric Liburd, pointed out to various anti whaling counties during debate on the secret ballot vote on the first day of the 2006 meeting in St Kitts that it was extremely hypocritical of such countries to pontificate on the need for transparency within the IWC by open voting when such countries quite happily voted via secret ballot in CITES, a similar management body.|$|E

500|$|However, Yong C.J. did not {{articulate}} any alternative {{test for}} determining if a restriction upon {{freedom of religion}} is appropriate.

500|$|RMS Titanic Inc. {{has also}} {{attempted}} to secure exclusive physical {{access to the}} wreck site. In 1996, it obtained a court order finding that it had [...] "the exclusive right to take any and all types of photographic images of the Titanic wreck and wreck site." [...] It obtained another order in 1998 against Deep Ocean Expeditions and Chris Haver, a British Virgin Islands corporation that aimed to run tourist trips to Titanic {{at a cost of}} $32,000 per person (it now charges $60,000). This was overturned in March 1999 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which ruled that the law of salvage did not extend to obtaining exclusive rights to view, visit and photograph a wreck. The court pointed out that Titanic is [...] "located in a public place" [...] in international waters, rather than in a private or controllable location to which access could be restricted by the owner. Granting such a right would also create a perverse incentive; since the aim of salvage is to carry out a salvage operation, leaving property in place so that it could be photographed would <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> this objective.|$|E

500|$|As well, anarchist activists {{focussed}} much {{of their}} energy towards preparing society for social revolution through education. Anarchists ran schools for children to <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> the Catholic schools and public schools, believing that religious schools were anathema to their ideas of freedom, and that public schools were too often used to instill ideas of [...] "patriotic nationalism" [...] and discourage free thought in children. In issues of ¡Tierra!, a weekly anarchist newspaper (published from 1899 through 1915, putting out more than 600 issues), writers denounced the public school requirement to pay allegiance to the Cuban flag, and encouraged teaching children that the flag {{was a symbol of}} [...] "closed mindedness and divisiveness." [...] Anarchists claimed that students enrolled in such schooling would become [...] "cannon fodder" [...] for a conflict of Liberal and Conservative Party leaders in 1906, which caused the US to intervene and occupy Cuba through 1909. Though anarchists had been running schools since that of the Círculo de Trabajadores, it wasn't until 1906 that the schools began to take on a less traditional flavor. In 1908, anarchists included a manifesto in issues of ¡Tierra! and La Voz del Dependiente, calling for the establishment of schools modeled after Francesc Ferrer's Escuela Moderna (Modern School).|$|E
500|$|The reconstructed Hurva {{was officially}} opened on March 15, 2010 in the {{presence}} of Israeli politicians and chief rabbis. A day earlier, hundreds of people had accompanied a new Torah scroll into the synagogue. Several Palestinian leaders claimed that the rededication signaled Israel's intent to destroy the Muslim holy places on the Temple Mount and replace it with the Third Temple. Fatah official Khatem Abd el-Khader called the renovation of the Hurva a [...] "provocation", warned Israel that it was [...] "playing with fire" [...] and called on Palestinians to [...] "converge on Al-Aksa to save it". Khaled Mashal of Hamas described the synagogue's opening as [...] "a declaration of war" [...] and called it a [...] "falsification of history and Jerusalem's religious and historic monuments". Fearing riots by Arab protestors, over 3,000 policemen were deployed ahead of the dedication ceremony. The Organisation of the Islamic Conference said that the reopening risked [...] "dragging the region into a religious war" [...] and claimed the building was historically on a waqf (Islamic trust) land. The Jordanian government also condemned the move stating that it [...] "categorically rejects the rededication of Hurva synagogue and all other unilateral Israeli measures in occupied East Jerusalem because they <b>run</b> <b>counter</b> <b>to</b> international legitimacy". Iran urged the international community to respond to the reopening and a Foreign Ministry spokesman called the move a [...] "catastrophe that has distressed the Islamic world". Israeli officials countered that Arab fears of a takeover of the Temple Mount were based on rumors and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu extended a message of coexistence. The U.S. State Department criticised Palestinians for stoking tensions at the rededication of the historic synagogue.
