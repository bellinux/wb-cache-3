Al or Zn treatments generated very intense spot (<b>R</b> <b>f</b> 0. 75) that increased in intensity in root and shoot extracts, as the concentration of Al or Zn increased.

In shoots Zn treatment at 500 μM caused a more increase in intensity of spot corresponding to malate, whereas, salicylic acid accumulation was much higher in the Zn-treated extracts at 1000 μM.

40|$|A {{significant}} {{advance in}} {{the knowledge of the}} mechanism of staphylocoagulase action was the discovery by Smith and Hale (1) of a factor in plasma and in tissues with which the coagulase reacts. This agent was named "activator " by the British investigators, and the "coagulase-reacting factor, " or "C. <b>R.</b> <b>F.</b> " by others (2 - 4). Evidence has been presented that C. <b>R.</b> <b>F.</b> is distinct from any of the blood components known at present to be essential for physiological clotting (2, 3).

Contrary claims, linking C. <b>R.</b> <b>F.</b> with albumin (5) and fraction IV- 4 of Cohn (6) resulted from the use of too weak coagulase preparations which permitted a coagulase inhibitor to mask the C. <b>R.</b> <b>F.</b> activity of globulins, and from reliance on ammonium sulfate fractionation which fails to eliminate C. <b>R.</b> <b>F.</b> from albumin.

40|$|At the {{restrictive}} conditions (35 ° under continuous light) Coprinus lagopus {{is unable}} to initiate premeiotic S phase which takes place normally within 8 – 10 h of karyogamy. A shift-up to the restrictive conditions causes an arrest of the basidiocarps at this critical stage. A prolonged arrest causes a reversal to mitosis (Lu 1974 b). Incubation of basidiocarps at the restrictive conditions before this critical stage causes no increase in recombination frequency (<b>R.</b> <b>F.)</b> in the loci studied. An arrest of 4 h at the critical stage still causes no <b>R.</b> <b>F.</b> increase, but 12 – 13 h and 18 – 19 h arrests cause increases of 50 % and 90 % over the controls, respectively. Thus <b>R.</b> <b>F.</b> can be increased even before the cells are fully committed to meiosis. —A 3 -h heat treatment {{at the beginning of}} S phase (or 8 h before karyogamy) also causes some (30 %) increase in <b>R.</b> <b>F.</b> while the same treatment at late S phase (or 3 h before karyogamy) causes a substantial (164 %) increase in <b>R.</b> <b>F.</b> over the controls. A 3 -h heat treatment before S phase causes no increase in <b>R.</b> <b>F.</b> —Pachytene is also responsive to temperature treatments (Lu 1969). The maximum <b>R.</b> <b>f.</b> increase is 100 % by heat and 220 % by cold treatment.

Autotomy was observed in the foot on the <b>R.</b> <b>F.</b> T. C side, in proportion to the increase in the <b>R.</b> <b>F.</b> T. C temperature above 60 ℃. Normal responses of digit spread, grip strength and foot drop in motor function were reduced immediately after <b>R.</b> <b>F.</b> T.

40|$|A {{resistance}} {{network is}} a connected graph (G, c). The conductance function cxy weights the edges, {{which are then}} interpreted as conductors of possibly varying strengths. The Dirichlet energy formEproduces a Hilbert space structure (which we call the energy spaceHE) on the space of functions of finite energy. We use the reproducing kernel{vx} constructed in [JP 09 b] to analyze the effective resistance R, which is a natural metric for such a network. It is known that when (G, c) supports nonconstant harmonic functions of finite energy, the effective resistance metric is not unique. The two most natural choices for R(x, y) are the “free resistance ” <b>R</b> <b>F,</b> and the “wired resistance ” R W. We define <b>R</b> <b>F</b> and <b>R</b> W {{in terms of the}} functions vx (and certain projections of them). This provides a way to express <b>R</b> <b>F</b> and <b>R</b> W as norms of certain operators, and explain <b>R</b> <b>F</b> � <b>R</b> W in terms of Neumann vs. Dirichlet boundary conditions.

Extracellular potentials evoked in the dentate gyrus by test pulses to the perforant path were recorded before and at various delays {{after a series of}} high-frequency stimulus trains to the perforant path (ten trains of eight pulses at 400 Hz, delivered at 5 min intervals). We have compared the magnitude and duration of l. t. p. of the population spike in this control condition with that observed when a low-intensity m. <b>r.</b> <b>f.</b> stimulation was delivered 10 s after each train to the perforant path. Post-event m. <b>r.</b> <b>f.</b> stimulation enhanced the amount of l. t. p. induced by the series of high-frequency stimulus trains and prolonged its duration for several days. The size of the population spike was unaffected by repeated m. <b>r.</b> <b>f.</b> stimulation in the absence of perforant path high-frequency stimulation, or when this failed to induce significant l. t. p. The temporal gradient of efficacy of m. <b>r.</b> <b>f.</b> stimulation was investigated. M. <b>r.</b> <b>f.</b> stimulation delivered 10 s after a single high-frequency stimulation of perforant path fibres resulted in an enhanced l. t. p. of both the population excitatory post-synaptic potential (e. p. s. p.) and population spike. L. t. p. was unaffected by m. <b>r.</b> <b>f.</b> stimulation given either before, or 120 s after perforant path high-frequency stimulation. These results show that low-intensity m. <b>r.</b> <b>f.</b> stimulation enhances lasting changes in synaptic function in the dentate gyrus when delivered during a critical period following high-frequency activation of perforant path fibres. These results are discussed in the light of our previous findings on the effects of post-event m. <b>r.</b> <b>f.</b> stimulation on memory and on the development of associative changes in hippocampal multiunit activity during conditioning.
