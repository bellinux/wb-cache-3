40|$|The {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis {{is the issue}} of procedure of social security insurance and allowance for state employment policy collection, procedure for debt recovery and securing of claims by all available legal means and evaluation of impacts on social situation of individuals. Social security insurance is, in addition to taxes, fees and custom duties, a revenue of state budget. It is based on the solidarity principle: young people help with their payments to the elderly, healthy people help ill people and people in a difficult life situation. The solidarity principle works reliably in all developed countries of the world. By collecting social security insurance, the State creates financial resources for implementation of fundamental social rights, which are guaranteed by international conventions and the Constitution of the Czech Republic, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms. The main objective of this thesis is, based on interviews with payers of insurance premiums and document analysis, in the first part to make a survey of impact of <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> in conducted execution proceedings into social situation of clients of District Social Security Administration Office in Strakonice and in the second part to determine to what extent the forced recovery of lawful duty has a share in deterioration of life situation of individuals. To achieve the defined goal I have chosen a method of document analysis, content analysis technique and secondary data analysis. As an additional method I used interviewing, the method of semi-structured interview. In order to obtain as much information about this topic as possible, I used qualitative research to collect primary data. The target group consisted of payers or former payers of insurance premiums who are also debtors of District Social Security Administration Office in Strakonice and whose insurance premium debt and penalty was recovered by administrative or judicial enforcement. Objective of the thesis has been achieved. Results of the research will raise awareness of the studied issues and may be used in practice during operation of executions in the district Social Security Administration offices...|$|E

40|$|EU VAT {{authorities}} {{are close to}} turning the tables on missing traders. For many years organized fraudsters have been stealing huge amounts of VAT on the domestic re-sale of exempt cross-border supplies. Losses have been enormous whether the transactions are in goods (notably cell phones and computer chips) or in tradable services (CO 2 permits and VoIP). No market has been safe from the fraudsters. Answers are developing, but these answers may look more like Armageddon than measured enforcement. Solutions are so draconian, and so all-encompassing that very few intra-community traders will feel safe from the gathering storm. The situation is not optimal, but {{it appears to be}} where we are headed. This paper discusses the alignment of (1) the joined cases of Axel Kittel v. Belgium and Belgium v. Recolta Recycling SPRL; (2) the Criminal Proceedings against R; and (3) the Council Directive 2010 / 24 /EU of 16 March 2010 concerning mutual assistance for the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> relating to taxes, duties, and other measures. A concluding section presents a series of six hypothetical fact patterns that apply these imperatives. In a nutshell, the argument presented through these hypotheticals is that Kittel is not for domestic-only application. Kittel responds just as effectively to multi-jurisdictional missing trader fact patterns as it does to domestic patterns. Secondly, it argues that “R” is an effective backstop to Kittel when tax authorities attack missing trader fraud across Community borders. Third, it argues that MARC provides sweeping cross-jurisdictional investigative assistance to any Member State that is pursuing recovery from a fraudster, or group of fraudsters. And finally, it argues that because Member States are under an affirmative obligation to pursue missing traders throughout the Community to protect the common system of VAT from assault by criminals, these tools are being readied for use in a wide-ranging wave of MTIC enforcement efforts throughout the Community. MARC’s enhanced investigative and enforcement powers allow/compel an easy flow of information, notification and protective measures among the member States. Multiple recoveries are a very distinct possibility. The EU VAT does not have a mechanism that assures one recovery, and neither the ECJ nor the judiciary of the member States seem anxious to find one. This may all be the result of the severity of the missing trader problem coming home to roost, but it is not good for legitimate business. Unfortunately we may witness a perfect storm. One cannot help but {{think that there is a}} better way forward...|$|E
40|$|Accounting {{terms are}} very {{important}} for every company {{in the sphere of}} company finance, accounting terms are claims and accounts payable. The aim of this work was detailed description of claims which are parts of belongings of any company. The work has two parts, theoretical and practical part. Practical part predominate in this work, the main themes are claims, their operating,ensuring and debt recovery. In the practical part I describe claims of MICo company and I made my own project how to deal with claims. The main reasons why claims come into existence are business relations, but they can be caused by provided deposits, loans and bank credits. Claims from business relations are necessary parts of belongings, because every businessman needs goods and services from others. A company can analyse high earnings and profit in accounting but his financial resources can be essentially different. For a company is very important to have a sufficient number of financial resources and to this a company ensures of claims and then restricts entrepreneurial risk. The ensuring of claims means that contractual partner is obliged to realise his account payable. General forms to ensure claims are for example: penal clause, liability, acknowledge a debt, bank quarantee or altitude of debt. We can divide claims in risk claims and abandoned claims. During trading a lot of profits are formed, these profits can be evoked by for example: political or economical events, announcing a financial insolvency or natural catastrophe. Between the most frequent cause of risk claims are mainly the absence of morality in business relations. If the payment of claim is not done until fixed date, the claim gets the bad debt. The only way how to anticipate abandoned claims is, that busines men do not let them come into existence. MICo, spol. s. r. o. divides debts into short-term and long-term claims. The term of expiration of claims is established at intervals 14 { [...] } 45 days, it depends on which customer it is. The company of MICo tryes to aviod claims after maturity, therefore MICo makes use of ensuring claims as a penal clause, debt approval, bank quarantee or deposit. In conclusion, I would like to recommend to any company to have an evidence of claims and pay attention mainly to a prevention of claims because the ambit of czech legislation for a protection of rights of an accounting payee and the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> is generally regarded as deficient. Bankruptcy proceedings is slow and ineffective. During the competition accounting payees have small or even no rights and basically they are degraded inactive role and therefore the whole bankruptcy proceedings is regarded as a paradise for debtors...|$|E
40|$|The Swedish {{exit tax}} {{legislation}} in Chapter 22. § 5 p. 4 IL states that businesses who change its tax residence to another Member State within the EES are taxed as having its assets {{sold at the}} time of the change of domicile. This legislation was declared incompatible with the freedom of establishment in case RÅ 2009 ref. 30 due to the fact that businesses who changed tax residence were treated worse than businesses that remained within the Member State of origin. Of importance for the outcome of the case was the fact that ECJ had declared exit tax incompatible with the freedom of establishment in two previous cases. In connection with RÅ 2008 ref. 30 the Commission also addressed requirements for Sweden to abolish the restrictive legislation through a reasoned opinion. In the aftermath of RÅ 2008 ref. 30 the legislator drafted a suggestion for new legislation which aimed to make the exit tag legislation in IL compatible with the freedom of establishment. The legislator made clear that the communication from the Commission on exit taxation was of great significance in formulating the legislation, particularly the requirement from the Commission that exit tax ought not to lead to immediate tax consequences for the businesses. The suggested legislation made businesses able to defer payment of the exit tax by introducing a new chapter in SBL. Thus did not the wording of the exit tax legislation in IL change. The suggested legislation was heavily criticized by the respondents in the preparatory legislation and also in legal doctrine. The legislation was, however, adopted and the deferment legislation in Chapter 17 a SBL came into force 1 January 2010. The question that arises is whether this addition to the exit tax legislation is a sufficient action to achieve the objective of the legislation. It can be concluded that the situation for businesses changing tax residence is not significantly affected by the introduction of the deferment legislation in Chapter 17 a SBL. The fact remains that business changing tax residence still are adversely affected due to the fact that taxation occurs on the exit date, which can have the effect of these businesses being taxed in an earlier phase than resident businesses. Consequently the legislation continue to impose immediate tax consequences in certain cases. The fact that the legislation could be achieved in a less restrictive manner by placing the time of taxation at the real disposal of the assets makes the legislation disproportionate. Furthermore, it is not obvious that the conditions which the deferment is associated with should be seen as proportionate either. Due to the fact that it is ascertain that the conditions in some cases can be costly in terms of valuation costs and that the purpose of the legislation could be achieved in a less restrictive manner by applying directives in the field of mutual assistance and <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> instead of an annual deferment procedure. The conditions could therefore be considered disproportionate in relation to the purpose of the legislation. Nevertheless, the main reason for arguing that the Swedish exit tax legislation should be considered as incompatible with the freedom of establishment is the fact that the legislation does not take full account of the taxed assets potential decrease in value, capable of arising after the businesses transfer of tax residence. Through ECJ-case law it can be noted that decrease in value must be taken into account by either the state of origin or the host state to be considered proportionate. The Swedish exit tax legislation is therefore incompatible with the freedom of establishment in all cases where the host state does not take notice of such decrease in value...|$|E
