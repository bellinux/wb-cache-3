5|$|The {{principal}} <b>receivers</b> are {{the wide}} <b>receivers</b> (WR) and the tight ends (TE). Wide <b>receivers</b> line up {{on or near}} the line of scrimmage, split outside the line.

30|$|We {{can make}} the {{following}} observations. First of all the max-log MAP <b>receiver</b> always performs better than the MMSE <b>receiver.</b> Together {{with the fact that}} the max-log MAP <b>receiver</b> has actually less complexity that the MMSE <b>receiver</b> [22], it is clearly the first choice for such a system. Also note that the performance of the max-log MAP <b>receiver</b> actually gets better when the interference gets stronger. Channel estimation errors have a stronger impact on the max-log MAP <b>receiver</b> than on the MMSE <b>receiver.</b> On the other hand it can be seen that in a frequency selective channel the max-log MAP <b>receiver</b> profits most from the the additional diversity, while the performance of the MMSE <b>receiver</b> hardly improves. This is due to the fact that the max-log MAP <b>receiver</b> has full diversity gain while MMSE <b>receiver</b> loses one order of diversity [34].|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{splitting}} <b>receiver,</b> which involves joint processing of coherently and non-coherently received signals. Using a passive RF power splitter, the received signal at each <b>receiver</b> antenna is {{split into two}} streams which are then processed by a conventional coherent detection (CD) circuit and a power-detection (PD) circuit, respectively. The streams of the signals from all the <b>receiver</b> antennas are then jointly used for information detection. We show that the splitting <b>receiver</b> creates a three-dimensional received signal space, due to the joint coherent and non-coherent processing. We analyze the achievable rate of a splitting <b>receiver,</b> which shows that the splitting <b>receiver</b> provides a rate gain of 3 / 2 compared to either the conventional (CD-based) coherent <b>receiver</b> or the PD-based non-coherent <b>receiver</b> in the high SNR regime.

40|$|Low optical-concentration {{solar thermal}} CPC {{collectors}} for process heat at 150 - 300. Â°C generally use thermal oil as the collector fluid. Thermal oils have low thermal conductivity and high viscosity, {{which leads to}} significant thermal resistance and hence reduced collector thermal efficiency. One way to minimize the thermal resistance is by having turbulent flow of the thermal oil within the <b>receiver.</b> For a given <b>receiver</b> area and mass flow rate of the fluid, this {{can be achieved by}} narrowing the flow passage but keeping the <b>receiver</b> area constant by adding external flat fins. In this paper a new <b>receiver</b> design for a compound parabolic concentrator is proposed which is a hybrid of a U-shaped tubular <b>receiver</b> and a bifacially irradiated flat <b>receiver.</b> To keep the <b>receiver</b> area constant, the fins are increased in width as the tube diameter is decreased. Its performance when enclosed in a glass vacuum tube and a CPC has been modelled. The transmission and absorption of solar energy, optical losses due to the receiver-reflector gap, heat transfer within the <b>receiver,</b> and the thermal losses have been modelled. Keeping the <b>receiver</b> area and fluid flow rate constant, the thermal resistance of the thermal oil flow within the <b>receiver</b> reduces when the flow passage is narrowed leading to increased thermal efficiency. On the other hand, the hybrid <b>receiver</b> has lower optical efficiency as compared to a tubular <b>receiver</b> due to its higher gap loss. Overall, the hybrid <b>receiver</b> has similar or better thermal efficiency than the tubular <b>receiver.</b> Thermal efficiency and effective thermal efficiency, which accounts for the pumping power penalty, shows that the performance improvement with thermal oil due to <b>receiver</b> shape optimization depends on the <b>receiver</b> area, concentration ratio, absorptivity and emissivity of the selective surface, the mass flow rate through the <b>receiver</b> and fluid temperature. Highest effective thermal efficiency is generally achieved in t...|$|R
