5|$|Because {{of their}} large numbers, many seamounts <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> be {{properly}} studied, and even mapped. Bathymetry and satellite altimetry are two technologies working {{to close the}} gap. There have been instances where naval vessels have collided with uncharted seamounts; for example, Muirfield Seamount is named after the ship that struck it in 1973. However, the greatest danger from seamounts are flank collapses; as they get older, extrusions seeping in the seamounts put pressure on their sides, causing landslides that {{have the potential to}} generate massive tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2016–17 season, the {{competition}} has been expanded to 54 entrants. All Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) clubs will participate, with the thirty clubs from the Championship, League One and League Two now joined by Under-20 {{teams from the}} twelve Premiership clubs. Also participating by invitation will be four teams each from the Highland and Lowland Leagues and four entrants from outside Scottish football – two each from the NIFL Premiership in Northern Ireland and the Welsh Premier League in Wales. Teams are seeded to enter the competition over any of the first four rounds, after which eight teams will <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> contest the quarter-finals. The final is played at a neutral venue.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff City Football Club is a {{professional}} association football club based in Cardiff, Wales. The club was founded in 1899 as Riverside A.F.C., by members of a local cricket club, and joined the Cardiff & District League the following year. In 1907, they joined the South Wales Amateur League and changed their name to Cardiff City, later entering the English football pyramid by joining the Southern Football League in 1910. They were elected into the Football League ten years later, where they <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> this day.

An earlier study predicted that about 3400dinosaur genera existed, including many {{that would not have been}} preserved in the fossil record.

5|$|Few skyscrapers {{were built}} in London before the late 20th century, owing to {{restrictions}} on building heights originally imposed by the London Building Act of 1894, which followed {{the construction of the}} 14-storey Queen Anne's Mansions.

5|$|In clade-based phylogenetic taxonomy, Ceratopsia {{is often}} defined {{to include all}} marginocephalians {{more closely related to}} Triceratops than to Pachycephalosaurus. Under this definition, the most basal known ceratopsians are Yinlong, from the Late Jurassic Period, along with Chaoyangsaurus and the family Psittacosauridae, from the Early Cretaceous Period, all of which were {{discovered}} in northern China or Mongolia. The rostral bone and flared jugals are already present in all of these forms, indicating that even earlier ceratopsians <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> be discovered.|$|E

5|$|Plant {{medicines}} {{can cause}} adverse effects and even death, whether by side-effects of their active substances, by adulteration or contamination, by overdose, or by inappropriate prescription. Many such effects are known, while others <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> be explored scientifically. There {{is no reason}} to presume that because a product comes from nature it must be safe: the existence of powerful natural poisons like atropine and nicotine shows this to be untrue. Further, the high standards applied to conventional medicines do not always apply to plant medicines, and dose can vary widely depending on the growth conditions of plants: older plants may be much more toxic than young ones, for instance.|$|E
5|$|Rojhaz {{is in fact}} Steve Rogers, {{the future}} costumed superhero known as Captain America. After {{fighting}} against a future fascist government dictatorship of the 21st century run by the President-For-Life, Rogers was captured. Wanting to dispose of Rogers so completely that not even his ashes would <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> inspire future rebellion, the President-for-Life had Rogers placed into a machine which should have killed him but instead sent him into the 1602 timeline. His presence not only brought about a rift that will destroy the universe, but it also caused the heroes {{of the twentieth century}} to appear centuries earlier to counter the Forerunner's negative effects.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine was the world's first {{publicly}} funded college of osteopathic medicine. It has a long-standing tradition of retaining its alumni in Michigan to practice – {{more than two-thirds}} of the college's graduates <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> practice in Michigan. In 2008, the Michigan State University Board of Trustees approved a resolution endorsing the expansion of the College of Osteopathic Medicine to two sites in southeast Michigan, a move board members and college officials say will not only improve medical education in the state, but also address a projected physician shortage.|$|E
5|$|The first {{crossing}} {{at what is}} now {{the site}} of the bridge was established in the 11thcentury by Margaret, queen consort of King Malcolm III, who founded a ferry service to transport religious pilgrims from Edinburgh to Dunfermline Abbey and St Andrews. Its creation gave rise to the port towns of Queensferry and North Queensferry, which <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> this day; and the service remained in uninterrupted use as a passenger ferry for over eight hundred years. There were proposals as early as the 1740s for a road crossing at the site, although their viability was only considered following the construction of the Forth Bridge in 1890.|$|E

The only close relative to the family is the stitchbird; their taxonomic relationships to other birds <b>remain</b> <b>to</b> be determined. A molecular study of the nuclear RAG-1 and c-mos genes of the three species within the family proved inconclusive, the data providing most support for either a basally diverging kōkako or huia.|$|E
