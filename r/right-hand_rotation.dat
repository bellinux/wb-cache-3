40|$|This Bureau of Mines report {{investigates the}} {{horizontal}} trajectory of boreholes drilled in coalbeds using the rotary drilling technique. Test holes drilled in coalbeds {{showed that the}} path of a borehole in the horizontal plane depends on drilling assembly configuration, drill bit rotation, and coalbed geologic features. An assembly that contained an 18 -ft (5. 53) long drill collar and two centralizers had the best horizontal stability evidenced by trajectories that deviated less than 16 ft (4. 9 m) from a target at 1, 000 ft (305 m). Removal of one of the centralizers resulted in a loss of control of hole trajectory in the horizontal plane. Generally, holes tended to turn to the right, presumably because of <b>right-hand</b> <b>rotation</b> of the bit. Deviations from the original bearing line were as much as 200 ft (61 m) or more at a depth of 1, 000 ft (305 m) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the conditions for residual stress measurement using a two-dimensional X-ray diffraction (2 D-XRD) {{in terms of both}} efficiency and accuracy. The measurements have been conducted on three stainless steel specimens in this study. The three specimens were processed by annealing, a cavitating jet in air and a disc grinder, with each method introducing different residual stresses at the surface. The specimens were oscillated in the ω- direction, representing a <b>right-hand</b> <b>rotation</b> of the specimen about the incident X-ray beam. The range of the oscillation, Δ ω, was varied and optimum Δ ω was determined. Moreover, combinations of the tilt angle between the specimen surface normal and the diffraction vector, ψ, with the rotation angle about its surface normal, f, have been studied with a view to find the most optimum condition. The results show that the use of ω oscillations is an effective method for improving analysis accu racy, especially for large grain metals. The standard error rapidly decreased with increasing range of the ω oscillation, especially for the annealed specimen which generated strong diffraction spots due to its large grain size. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{structure}} of simian virus 40 (SV 40) chromatin was probed by treatment with single- and multiple-site bacterial restriction endonucleases. Approximately the same {{fraction of the}} chromatin DNA was cleaved by each of three different single-site endonucleases, indicating that the nucleosomes do not have unique positions with regard to specific nucleotide sequences within the population of chromatin molecules. However, the extent of digestion {{was found to be}} strongly influenced by salt concentration. At 100 mM NaCl- 5 mM MgCl 2, only about 20 % of the simian virus 40 (SV 40) DNA I in chromatin was converted to linear SV 40 DNA III. In contrast, at lower concentrations of NaCl (0. 05 or 0. 01 M), an additional 20 to 30 % of the DNA was cleaved. These results suggest that at 100 mM NaCl only the DNA between nucleosomes was accessible to the restriction enzymes, whereas at the lower salt concentrations, DNA within the nucleosome regions became available for cleavage. Surprisingly, when SV 40 chromatin was digested with multiple-site restriction enzymes, less than 2 % of the DNA was digested to limit digest fragment, whereas only a small fraction (9 to 15 %) received two or more cuts. Instead, the principal digest fragment was full-length linear SV 40 DNA III. The failure to generate limit digest fragments was not a consequence of reduced enzyme activity in the reaction mixtures or of histone exchange. When the position of the principal cleavage site was mapped after HpaI digestion, it was found that this site was not unique. Nevertheless, all sites wree not cleaved with equal probability. An additional finding was that SV 40 chromatin containing nicked-circular DNA II produced by random nicking of DNA I was also resistant to digestion by restriction enzymes. These results suggest that the initial cut which causes relaxation of topological constraint in SV 40 chromatin DNA imparts resistance to further digestion by restriction enzymes. We propose that this may be accomplished by either "winding" of the internucleosomal DNA into the body of the nucleosome, or as suggested by others, by successive <b>right-hand</b> <b>rotation</b> of nucleosomes...|$|E
40|$|Some {{features}} of steepened magnetosonic waves are discussed {{with reference to}} the Giacobini-Zinner data set. In particular, attention is given to the discovery of discrete intervals of both phase rotation and lack of phase rotation within a single wavelength and also to the presence of intervals of 'backward' <b>rotations</b> (<b>right-hand</b> polarized in the spacecraft frame) within the magnetosonic wave. Possible explanations of these features are reviewed, and it is suggested that these features are nonlinear manifestations of the wave steepening process...|$|R
5000|$|In general, {{polarization}} is elliptical and is traced in a clockwise or counterclockwise sense, as {{viewed in}} the direction of propagation. If, however, the major and minor axes of the ellipse are equal, then the polarization is said to be circular [...] If the minor axis of the ellipse is zero, the polarization is said to be linear [...] Rotation of the electric vector in a clockwise sense is designated <b>right-hand</b> polarization, and <b>rotation</b> in a counterclockwise sense is designated left-hand polarization ...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop an}} {{estimator}} for the magnetic helicity density, {{a measure of}} the spiral geometry of magnetic field lines, in the wave number domain as a wave diagnostic tool based on multi-point measurements in space. The estimator is numerically tested with a synthetic data set and then applied to an observation of magnetic field fluctuations in the Earth foreshock region provided by the four-point measurements of the Cluster spacecraft. The energy and the magnetic helicity density are determined in the frequency and the wave number domain, which allows us to identify the wave properties in the plasma rest frame correcting for the Doppler shift. In the analyzed time interval, dominant wave components have parallel propagation to the mean magnetic field, away from the shock at about Alfvén speed and a left-hand spatial rotation sense of helicity with respect to the propagation direction, which means a <b>right-hand</b> temporal <b>rotation</b> sense of polarization. These wave properties are well explained by the right-hand resonant beam instability as the driving mechanism in the foreshock. Cluster observations allow therefore detailed comparisons with various theories of waves and instabilities...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{magnetic}} fluctuations, at the magnetopause and in {{the adjacent}} magnetosheath, exhibit power law spectra which are very reminiscent of turbulent spectra. In prospect of future modelizations of such a turbulence, new information is brought about the experimental properties of these fluctuations. The power laws spectra previously obtained in the ULF range are shown to hold also in VLF, up to the lower hybrid frequency. Concerning the polarization, 1) the direction {{with respect to the}} static magnetic field is shown to be dominantly perpendicular at low frequencies, consistently with Shear Alfven modes in this range, and 2) no <b>right-hand</b> sense of <b>rotation</b> can be evidenced at frequencies higher than the proton gyrofrequency, although one could expect the fast magnetosonic mode to be dominant in this range. The physical implications of this last observation for the non linear effects at work in the turbulence are briefly discussed...|$|R
