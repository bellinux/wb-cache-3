25|$|If {{this image}} were {{transferred}} directly to paper, {{it would create}} a mirror-type image and the paper would become too wet. Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket,</b> which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or offset to the <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket</b> cylinder, this reproduction method is known as offset lithography or offset printing.|$|E

60|$|Matt at once stopped driving, and {{adjusted}} the <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket</b> {{in front of}} his seat. This was no easy job, for the wind kept increasing in violence. He had barely completed the work when there came a crash of thunder, and then the rain came down harder than ever.|$|E
60|$|When the gorging {{was done}} and the {{cigarettes}} brought out (the chauffeur passed a spirit lamp), they stretched on <b>rubber</b> <b>blankets,</b> and groaned a little, and spoke well {{of nature and the}} delights of roughing it.|$|R

60|$|Seth {{attempted}} to rise; {{but had no}} more than gotten up on one elbow when a most violent nausea assailed him, and he fell back on the <b>rubber</b> <b>blankets</b> which had served as pillow, feeling much as he looked--desperately ill.|$|R
60|$|He gazed {{around him}} curiously. He {{was in a}} plainly {{furnished}} room, lying {{on the top of}} a bed covered with a <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket,</b> so that his wet clothing might not soil the linen beneath. His coat and shoes had been removed, likewise his collar and tie, but that was all.|$|E
60|$|Feeling {{that nothing}} was to be done until the storm should abate, Matt climbed into the wagon again and {{protected}} himself {{as well as he}} could with the <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket</b> and the lap-robe. The back shade of the wagon was down, and he was glad to see that so far the stock inside had sustained no damage.|$|E
60|$|Charmian and I {{looked at}} each other. The exhilaration of the ride we had taken was still upon us. Forgotten were the letters to Raiatea, the {{officials}} we had to visit. Shoes, a shirt, a pair of trousers, cigarettes matches, and a book to read were hastily crammed into a biscuit tin and wrapped in a <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket,</b> and we were over the side and into the canoe.|$|E
60|$|But Andrew Dilks had set {{his mind}} on getting a further reduction, and at last the bargain was settled, and they paid over a hundred and ninety dollars for the turnout, leaving them still ten dollars to expend upon <b>rubber</b> <b>blankets</b> and other {{necessary}} articles.|$|R
60|$|To protect {{themselves}} still {{more from the}} mist and cold, they brought out four <b>rubber</b> <b>blankets</b> of good size. These were laced into one big sheet and raised over the launch like an awning. Then all huddled beneath, to make themselves as comfortable as possible.|$|R
60|$|To {{keep out}} still {{more of the}} cold the two sleds were stood up between some {{of the trees and}} the canvas {{coverings}} and <b>rubber</b> <b>blankets</b> were stretched around as far as they would go. By that time all of the boys were worn out with their labors and their journey and glad enough to retire.|$|R
60|$|Any {{quantity}} of dry sticks {{were to be}} had, and they had brought with them both an ax and a hatchet, so they soon had the sticks reduced to a proper size for burning. Near the shore {{were a number of}} bushes, and they cut out a spot in the center of these and over the top spread the canvas they had brought with them. For a flooring, they gathered some leaves, and over this spread a <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket</b> {{when it came time to}} go to bed.|$|E
60|$|Each {{day they}} camped {{in a new}} spot, and while Lita nibbled the fresh grass at her ease, Miss Celia sketched under the big umbrella, Thorny read or lounged or slept on his <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket,</b> and Ben made himself {{generally}} useful. Unloading, filling the artist's water-bottle, piling the invalid's cushions, setting out the lunch, running to and fro for a Bower or a butterfly, climbing a tree to report the view, reading, chatting, or frolicking with Sancho,--any sort of duty was in Ben's line, and he did them all well, for an out-of-door life was natural {{to him and he}} liked it.|$|E
60|$|Down at {{the camp}} a new {{surprise}} was awaiting me. Br'er Rabbit was under the tent fly, tugging away at the salt bag which I had left there carelessly after curing a bearskin. While he was absorbed in getting it {{out from under the}} <b>rubber</b> <b>blanket,</b> I crept up on hands and knees, and stroked him once from ears to tail. He jumped straight up with a startled squeak, whirled in the air, and came down facing me. So we remained for a full moment, our faces scarcely two feet apart, looking into each other's eyes. Then he thumped the earth soundly with his left hind foot, to show that he was not afraid, and scurried under the fly and through the brakes in a half circle to a bush at my heels, where he sat up straight in the shadow to watch me.|$|E
60|$|Have {{you ever}} seen canvas {{tarpaulins}} or <b>rubber</b> <b>blankets</b> with brass eyelets set in along the edges? Then imagine a piece of stout canvas, some four and one-half feet in length, with large and heavy brass eyelets running down both edges. The width of this canvas is never the full girth {{of the human body}} it is to surround. The width is also irregular--broadest at the shoulders, next broadest at the hips, and narrowest at the waist.|$|R

[...] "We can pile up some tree {{branches}} on the windy side and put the <b>rubber</b> <b>blankets</b> over them. Then, during the night, we can build a fire {{right in the middle of}} the hut. But we'll have to take turns at guarding, to prevent the place from catching fire and to prevent those sleeping from smothering, if the wind should change." ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{quality of}} the printed screen {{elements}} made by the application of two types of offset <b>rubber</b> <b>blankets</b> (ORB) have been investigated in this work. The force in the contact zone between the offset cylinder (ORB) and the printing cylinder (printing substrate) is decisive for making the prints. With the different structure of ORB the different deformation zone is created, which results in forming the different sizes of the screen elements. The printing substrate has also influence, {{and because of that}} 5 characteristic papers (fine art paper gloss, fine art paper mat, offset paper, calendered offset paper and recycled paper) have been analyzed. The results show that on the tested printing substrates, the both ORBs form the greatest dot gains in the following order: offset paper, recycled paper, calendered offset paper, fine art paper mat and fine art paper gloss. Such results are completely in accordance with the original roughness of paper. Key words: offset, offset cylinder, deviation of the printe...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} an analytical tool to quantify material consistency of offset printing blankets. Printing blankets are essentially viscoelastic rubber composites of several laminas. High levels of material consistency are expected from <b>rubber</b> <b>blankets</b> for quality print and for quick recovery from smash encountered during the printing process. The present study aims at determining objectively the consistency of printing blankets at three specific torque levels of tension under two distinct stages; 1. under normal printing conditions and 2. on recovery after smash. The experiment devised exhibits a variation in tone reproduction properties of each blanket signifying the levels of inconsistency also in thickness direction. Correlation technique was employed on ink density variations obtained from the blanket on paper. Both blankets exhibited good consistency over three torque levels under normal printing conditions. However on smash the recovery of blanket and its consistency was a function of manufacturing and torque levels. This study attempts to provide a new metrics for failure analysis of offset printing blankets. It also underscores the need for optimising the torque for blankets from different manufacturers. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Most of Indonesian rubber {{products}} SIR 20 {{are made from}} the material of raw rubber obtained from smallholders. However, the quality of this material is not good enough. Thus, quality improvement has {{to be carried out}} by manufacturers. The liquid smoke used during the blanket hanging process can improve the quality of the {{rubber products}} SIR 20. This research aimed to determine and study the effects of liquid smoke spraying and blanket hanging duration on the drying factor, the dry rubber content, technical quality, vulcanization characteristics, and physical properties of vulcanized natural rubber. Treatments consisted of various hanging duration (6, 8, and 10 days, and without hanging) and spraying (with and without spraying of liquid smoke). The results showed that the spraying of liquid smoke on natural <b>rubber</b> <b>blankets</b> could improve the technical quality of the natural rubber, especially the values of Po and PRI. The spraying of liquid smoke could reduce the blanket hanging duration to 6 - 8 days. The blankets sprayed with liquid smoke had the optimum cure time of around 15 minutes and 19 seconds and the scorch time of around 3 minutes and 22 seconds. These values indicated that the vulcanization characteristics of blankets which were sprayed with liquid smoke were generally better than those of blankets which were not sprayed with liquid smok...|$|R
