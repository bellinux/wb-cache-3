Rabies virus neutralizing antibodies (rVNAs) were detected in 11 % (7 of 63) of human sera tested. Rabies virus ribonucleoprotein (RNP) immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were detected in the sera of three individuals, two of whom were also seropositive for rVNA. Rabies virus RNP IgM antibodies were detected in one <b>respondent</b> <b>with</b> no evidence of rVNA or RNP IgG antibodies. Because one <b>respondent</b> <b>with</b> positive rVNA results reported prior vaccination and 86 % (six of seven) of rVNA-positive respondents reported being bitten by bats, these data suggest nonfatal exposure of persons to rabies virus, which is likely associated with vampire bat depredation...|$|R
