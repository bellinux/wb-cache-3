HouseGuests could exchange tickets and take up to three shots at one time. The first HouseGuest to land a ball in the center heart would be the new Head of Household. Paul was the winner.

On Day 17, Paul nominated Alex and Josh for eviction, with the plan to backdoor Cody, while Ramses revealed his curse and named himself as a third nominee.

On Day 18, Paul, Alex, Josh, and Ramses, alongside Elena and Matt, recalled in the Path of Least <b>Resistance</b> <b>Power</b> of Veto competition. In this competition, HouseGuests competed individually. They must go through a series of rooms and answer questions based on what they have seen throughout the previous rooms. If they answer a question correctly, they may walk through a quicker path. If they answer incorrectly, they must take a delayed path that contains a challenge that will slow them down. The HouseGuest to make it through all five areas in the fastest time will win the Power of Veto. Paul was the winner. On Day 20, Paul took Josh off the block and named Cody as the replacement nominee. On Day 23, Cody was evicted by a 7-3-0 vote, with Christmas, Jessica, and Kevin voting to evict Ramses.
