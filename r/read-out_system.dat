For {{the first time}} in commercially {{available}} oscilloscopes, the 7000 series had a digital <b>read-out</b> <b>system,</b> so a plug in could display its settings or display the value of a measurement on the CRT. The 7D11 ($2,915 in 1983) was a digital delay, the 7D15 ($3,020) was a 225 MHz counter/timer, the 7D13 ($1,105) was a multimeter, and the 7D12/M2 ($2,815) was a sample-and-hold with an analog-to-digital converter. More exotic digital plug ins used the mainframe oscilloscope as a mere display unit. The 7D01 and 7D02 were logic analyzer plug ins. The triple-wide 7D20 programmable digitizer with GPIB ($7,750 in 1983) would turn an analog mainframe into a digital scope.|$|E

In order to enable correction for variations in environmental conditions (temperature, mechanical stress etc), a study has been performed {{on the performance of}} uncoated sensing MRRs, and of SU 8 - and SiO 2 -covered reference MRRs. Excellent shielding for both cover materials has been obtained, however, water permeation into the SU 8 causes a slow drift in sensor response. We believe that a user-friendly, low-cost and robust way for optical interfacing to MRR sensor chips is required for practical application in Point-Of-Care diagnostics, and that the cost and complexity of optical-electrical <b>read-out</b> <b>systems</b> must decrease.

30|$|The muon {{data are}} {{compiled}} and analyzed by a network-based FPGA (field programmable gate array) muon <b>read-out</b> <b>system.</b> This <b>read-out</b> <b>system</b> comprises power-effective comparators, an FPGA chip, a network chip, and a switching regulator. The total {{weight of the}} muon <b>read-out</b> <b>system</b> is 420 g. The direct output from the photomultiplier tube is directed by a 5 -m cable to the muon <b>read-out</b> <b>system</b> to convert the PMT voltage spikes into logic pulses determined by {{the transition from a}} logic- 0 to a logic- 1 level, which is readable by the FPGA. The FPGA chip computes a muon track by identifying two simultaneous (in 200 ns) signals from two different detector planes of the telescope. If the PMT pulses from two detector planes occur within 200 ns, they are deemed to result from a muon passing completely through two detector planes. The gate width of 200 ns is wide enough for a typical muon-traverse time of 6 ns between two detectors but narrow enough for a cosmic-ray muon event rate of ∼ 100 Hz. It is very unlikely that two muon events will occur in the same 200 -ns window. The velocity of light in the plastic scintillator, which has an index of reflection of approximately 1.5, is v = c/ 1.5. In addition, the average path that light traverses through the scintillator can be up to 50 % longer than the straight path, due to reflection off the sides of the scintillator with reflective Mylar. This means that for a 1 -m scintillator, it takes about 7.5 ns to travel {{from one end to the}} other. As it takes approximately 2 ns to convert light into an electric current in a PMT, the total delay for the event will be approximately 9.5 ns. This delay is acceptable for the requirements of time resolution.|$|E
