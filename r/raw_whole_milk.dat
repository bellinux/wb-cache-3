40|$|A new assay {{has been}} {{developed}} for measuring residual alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity {{in a wide variety}} of dairy products. The method proposed is simple, rapid and directly applicable to solid and liquid dairy samples. ALP in the test sample hydrolyzes a non fluorescent substrate, trifluoromethyl-beta-umbelliferone phosphate, to its highly fluorescent phenolate product. The assay is performed in a reverse micellar medium composed of mixed buffer (2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol buffer pH 9. 0 and borate buffer pH 9. 0) in AOT/isooctane, at a temperature of 38 degrees C. Total test time is 450 s. Reaction rates are linear (except for butter) up to 8. 5 and 11 % (v/v) <b>raw</b> <b>milk,</b> for <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> and chocolate milk, respectively. The detection limits are 0. 04, 0. 4 and 0. 22 % (v/v) <b>raw</b> <b>milk,</b> for <b>whole</b> <b>milk,</b> chocolate milk and butter, respectively.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Lack {{of clear}} risk factor {{identification}} {{is the main}} reason for the persistence of brucellosis infection in the Chinese population, and there has been little assessment of the factors contributing to Brucella contamination of <b>raw</b> <b>whole</b> <b>milk.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify risk factors affecting Brucella contamination of raw milk, and to evaluate effective measures for disease reduction in order to determine preventive strategies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A nationwide survey was conducted and samples were obtained from 5211 cows corresponding to 25 sampling locations throughout 15 provinces in China. The prevalence of Brucella in the raw milk samples averaged 1. 07 % over the 15 Chinese provinces, while the prevalence of positive areas within these regions ranged from 0. 23 - 3. 84 % among the nine provinces with positive samples. The survey examined factors that supposedly influence Brucella contamination of <b>raw</b> <b>whole</b> <b>milk,</b> such as management style, herd size, abortion rate, hygiene and disease control practices. A binary logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the association between risk factors for Brucella and contamination of milk samples. Furthermore, a relative effect decomposition study was conducted to determine effective strategies for reducing the risk of Brucella contamination of <b>raw</b> <b>whole</b> <b>milk.</b> Our data indicate that disease prevention and control measures, abortion rate, and animal polyculture are the most important risk factors. Meanwhile, culling after quarantine was identified as an effective protective measure in the current Chinese dairy situation. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that, although there is a low risk of contamination of milk with Brucella nationwide in China, there are individual regions where contamination is a significant problem. Controlling three factors-culling after quarantine, maintaining a low abortion rate, and avoiding mixing groups of cattle and small ruminants-could effectively reduce the risk of Brucella contamination of <b>raw</b> <b>whole</b> <b>milk...</b>|$|E

40|$|Methods for on-farm {{extraction}} of low-concentration (minor) proteins from raw whole bovine milk directly after milking were explored. These minor proteins have high commercial value. Lactoferrin (LF) and lactoperoxidase (LP) {{were used as}} model proteins for extraction using cation exchange chromatography. Laboratory fractionations showed that milk could be processed by conventional column chromatography without excessive column backpressures if resin with large particles sizes were used and the temperature was high enough so fat in the milk was malleable; ideally the milk should be near the secretion temperature of 37 oC. Processing parameters such as equilibrium and dynamic capacities were determined for SP Sepharose ™ (GE Healthcare Technologies) and Bio Rex 70 (BioRad Laboratories) resins. SP Sepharose Big Beads (SP BB) {{were found to be}} more suitable than BR 70, for <b>raw</b> <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> processing due to the larger size (200 um). Design considerations showed that column chromatography was not the most practical method for on-farm processing of fresh, <b>raw</b> <b>whole</b> <b>milk.</b> Trials with a single-stage stirred tank showed that SP BB resin could extract up to 65 % of LF (initial LF concentration of 0. 5 mg/mL) with a 10 -minute adsorption time. The composite non-linear (CNL) model of Rowe et al. (1999) was used to describe LF uptake by SP BB resin in <b>raw</b> <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> with initial LF concentrations of 0 to 1. 0 mg/mL and resin:milk volume ratios of 0. 010, 0. 012, 0. 017 and 0. 024 over 45 -minute contact times. The CNL model could be used to predict LF yields if initial feed concentration, milk and resin volumes, and contact times were known. Laboratory extractions showed that processing did not significantly affect bulk milk composition (fat, protein, lactose and total solids), indicating that the milk could be used for conventional processing after the minor proteins had been extracted. Resin cleaning and regeneration studies, using a procedure similar to that recommended by the resin supplier, showed that the Sepharose resin had not degraded and there was no significant decrease in binding capacity after 50 extraction cycles. A Protein Fractionation Robot (PFR) prototype based on a single-stage stirred tank and the operating parameters obtained from the laboratory trials was designed, assembled and coupled to an Automated Milking System (AMS) to process fresh, <b>raw</b> <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> from individual cows immediately after milking. The LF and LP extracted from the milk from 16 individual cows were 19. 7 - 55. 2 % (35. 6 10. 2 %) and 21. 2 - 99. 5 % (87. 1 12. 0 %) respectively. Generally, higher extraction levels were obtained at higher resin:milk ratios. The amount of LF extracted on-farm agreed within 14. 1 9. 8 % of those predicted by the CNL model, with predicted values generally being higher. The experimental on-farm adsorption values were calculated using data of LF recovered after elution, so differences between actual and predicted values may be due to losses during post-adsorption processing. Economic feasibility studies, based on experimental data from the PFR and realistic wholesale prices for LF and LP ($ 400 and $ 150 /kg respectively) showed that PFR-based processing is economically viable if the farmer is paid for the LF and LP produced as well as the bulk milk. This system would have a payback period of approximately five years and an internal rate of return of 14. 5 %. Further case studies determined the sensitivity of the economics to various operating parameters and value/cost assumptions, including producing recombinant human protein from transgenic bovine milk. These studies showed that the higher the value of the processed raw milk, the higher the absorptive capacity of the resin, and the higher the value of the extracted protein, the more favourable the economics. In the extreme case of producing a very high value therapeutic protein (e. g. $ 20 000), the payback period could be as low as 0. 3 years, with an internal rate of return of 818 %...|$|E

One portion was gravity separated at 4 °C for 22 h and the second portion was centrifugally separated to produce skim milk that was also gravity separated with somatic cells rising to the surface. After 22 h, stock solutions (low SCC skim milk, high SCC skim <b>milk,</b> high SCC <b>whole</b> <b>milk)</b> were prepared and preserved (bronopol). Two experiments were conducted, one to compare the shelf-life of skim and <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> SCC standards at 4 °C and one to determine the effect of freezing and thawing on SCC standards. Both experiments were replicated 3 times. Gravity separation was an effective approach to isolate and concentrate somatic cells from bovine milk and redistribute them in a skim or <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> matrix to create a set of reference materials with a wider and more uniformly distributed range of SCC than current calibration sets. The liquid SCC reference materials stored using the common industry practice at 4 °C were stable (i. e., fit for purpose, no large decrease in SCC) for a 2 -wk period, whereas frozen and thawed reference materials may have a much longer useful life. A gradual decrease occurred in residual difference in ESCC (SCC × 1, 000 /mL) versus original assigned reference SCC over duration of refrigerated storage for both skim and <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> SCC samples, indicating that milk ESCC of the preserved milks was gradually decreasing during 28 d of storage at 4 °C by about 15, 000 SCC/mL.

An experiment was designed where skim milk was heated at high temperatures (76 °C for 7 min) to stop the gravity separation of SC and then colostrum was added back to try to restore the gravity separation of SC in increasing increments to achieve 0, 0. 4, 0. 8, 2. 0, and 4. 0 g/L of added Ig. The milk was allowed to gravity separate for 22 h at 4 °C. The heat treatment (76 °C for 7 min) of skim milk was sufficient to stop the gravity separation of SC. The treatment of 4. 0 g/L of added Ig was successful in restoring the gravity separation of SC as compared to raw skim. Preliminary spore data on the third replicate suggested that bacterial spores gravity separate the same way as the SC in raw, and heated skim with 4. 0 g/L of added Ig. There is strong evidence that Ig are at least one of the factors necessary for the gravity separation of SC and bacterial spores. Our second objective was to determine the role that Ig and somatic cells (SC) play in the gravity separation of milk. There were 9 treatments: (1) low temperature pasteurized (LTP) (72 °C for 17. 31 s) <b>whole</b> <b>milk,</b> (2) LTP (72 °C for 17. 31 s) <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> with added bacteria and spores, (3) recombined LTP (72 °C for 17. 31 s) <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> with added bacteria and spores, (4) high temperature pasteurized (HTP) (76 °C for 7 min) <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> with added bacteria and spores, (5) HTP (76 °C for 7 min) <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> with added bacteria and spores and added colostrum, (6) HTP (76 °C for 7 min) centrifugal separated gravity separated (CS GS) skim milk with HTP (76 °C for 7 min) low SC cream with added bacteria and spores, (7) HTP (76 °C for 7 min) CS GS skim milk with HTP (76 °C for 7 min) high SC cream with added bacteria and spores, (8) HTP (76 °C for 7 min) CS GS skim milk with HTP (76 °C for 7 min) low SC cream with added bacteria and spores and added colostrum, and (9) HTP (76 °C for 7 min) CS GS skim milk with HTP (76 °C for 7 min) high SC cream with added bacteria and spores and added colostrum. The milks in 9 treatments were gravity separated at 4 °C for 23 h in glass columns. The presence of both SC and Ig were necessary for normal gravity separation (i. e., rising to the top) of fat, bacteria, and spores in <b>whole</b> <b>milk.</b> The presence of Ig alone without SC was not sufficient to cause bacteria, fat and spores to rise to the top without SC. The SC may provide the buoyancy required for the aggregates to rise to the top due to gas within the SC. More research is needed to understand the mechanism of the gravity separation process. ii 2019 - 01 - 2...|$|R
