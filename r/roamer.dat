His opera Die beiden Neffen (The Two Nephews) was rehearsed {{for him on}} his 15th birthday. 1829 saw Die Heimkehr aus der Fremde (Son and Stranger or Return of the <b>Roamer),</b> a comedy of mistaken identity written in honour of his parents' silver anniversary and unpublished during his lifetime. In 1825 he wrote a more sophisticated work, Die Hochzeit des Camacho (Camacho's Wedding), based on an episode in Don Quixote, for public consumption. It was produced in Berlin in 1827, but coolly received. Mendelssohn left the theatre before {{the conclusion of the}} first performance, and subsequent performances were cancelled.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTo {{maximize}} their fitness, individuals of one sex can display discrete reproductivephenotypes, called alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs). Individuals followingARTs show behavioural variation, which {{might result in}} differences in energyintake and expenditure. However, few studies have compared activity budgets andnon-sexual behaviour of individuals following ARTs in nature. We studied maleAfrican striped mice Rhabdomys pumilio, which can follow three ARTs: (1) breedingmale {{of a group of}} females; (2) philopatrics remaining in their natal group; or(3) solitary living <b>roamers.</b> We predicted that each tactic is characterized by itsspecific activity budget, representing alternative energy trade-offs. We conductedfocal animal observations on 70 males following ARTs. <b>Roamers</b> had higher travellingrates than philopatrics, and breeders had larger daily range sizes compared tophilopatrics but not <b>roamers.</b> Philopatrics had higher foraging rates than breedersand showed more socio-positive behaviour than <b>roamers.</b> Breeders and philopatricswere in their nest more often than <b>roamers,</b> potentially engaging in social interactionswith other group members. <b>Roamers</b> were chased off more often than breeders,but the three tactics did not differ concerning rates of socio-negativebehaviour. Overall, philopatrics allocated their time towards behaviours that wouldincrease body mass and survival probability, which could improve the probabilityto switch to a tactic of higher reproductive success. In contrast, breeders and roamersallocated their time towards behaviours that would increase their chances tomate. In conclusion, following ARTs results in contrasting activity budgets thatreflect the differences in reproductive behaviours observed between tactics...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} plasticity hypothesis {{predicts that}} alternative tactics {{are associated with}} changes in steroid hormone levels. In species with alternative male reproductive tactics, the highest androgen levels have usually been reported in dominant males. However, in sociable species, dominant males show amicable behaviors {{to gain access to}} females, which might conflict with high testosterone levels. We compared testosterone, corticosterone and resting metabolic rate in male striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) following a conditional strategy with three different reproductive tactics: (i) philopatric group-living males, (ii) solitary living <b>roamers,</b> (iii) dominant but sociable group-living territorial breeders. Philopatrics had the lowest testosterone but highest corticosterone levels, suggesting that they make the best of a bad job. Dominant territorial breeders had lower testosterone levels than <b>roamers,</b> which have a lower competitive status. <b>Roamers</b> had the highest testosterone levels, which might promote risky behavior, such as invading territories defended by territorial males. <b>Roamers</b> also had lower resting metabolic rates than either type of group-living males. Our results suggest that dominant males` testosterone levels reflect a trade-off between low testosterone amicable behavior and high testosterone dominance behavior...|$|R

60|$|Billy was {{impressed}} by the ease with which the <b>Roamer</b> was operated. While they lingered at table, at a word from Hastings the two Japanese had gone on deck. Billy could hear them throwing down the halyards, casting off gaskets, and heaving the anchor short on the tiny winch. In several minutes one called down that everything was ready, and all went on deck. Hoisting mainsail and jigger was a matter of minutes. Then the cook and cabin-boy broke out anchor, and, while one hove it up, the other hoisted the jib. Hastings, at the wheel, trimmed the sheet. The <b>Roamer</b> paid off, filled her sails, slightly heeling, and slid across the smooth water and out the mouth of New York Slough. The Japanese coiled the halyards and went below for their own dinner.|$|E

40|$|International audienceOxytocin (OT) and {{arginine}} vasopressin (AVP) are {{produced in the}} brain. Due to their importance inmodulating social behaviour, these two neuropepetideshave been extensively studied in captivity, yet few data areavailable from the field. Here we report the findings froman immunohistochemistry study, where we measured densityof OT and AVP in different brain nuclei of wildAfrican striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio). Striped miceare socially flexible with both sexes being able to followalternative reproductive tactics. Adult males can remainnatally philopatric, or they can disperse and live solitarilyas <b>roamers</b> or immigrate into a group and become breeders. Previous studies in captivity found no differences betweensolitary and group-living striped mice in AVPR 1 a expression,but solitary males had higher irAVP concentrations inthe paraventricular nucleus and BNST. In the present studywe tested whether the results obtained from captive studiescould be replicated in the wild. We collected brains from 5 breeders, 9 philopatrics, and 3 <b>roamers</b> from a field site inSouth Africa and transported them to the USA forimmunohistochemistry. Our results showed that roamershave higher irAVP concentrations in the BNST than philopatrics,which leads us to predict for future experimentalstudies that <b>roamers</b> {{will be able to}} increase AVP secretionin the brain when becoming group-living...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Roamers</b> {{originated}} from the Kanaka, {{the last of}} the eleven generation ships to leave Earth.

With their food reserves rapidly dwindling, the people decided to take their chances in space (where they had thrived), and so they all boarded the still intact Kanaka and set out into the vast galaxy once again. Eventually they re-established contact with the people they had left at the Meyer rubble belt, and all banded together to find a new way of life amongst the stars.|$|R

40|$|Alternative {{reproductive}} tactics {{occur when}} individuals {{of the same}} species follow alternative ways to maximize reproductive success. Often younger and smaller males follow tactics which result in lower fitness than that of dominant larger males. The relative plasticity hypothesis predicts that hormone levels change as males change tactics, but direct tests of this hypothesis are missing. It has been demonstrated in a number of studies that males following different tactics also differ in hormone levels (unpaired data), but not that individual males change their hormone levels as they change tactic (paired data). We compared hormone levels in the same individuals before and after they changed their tactic, using field samples collected over a period of 6 years. We studied male striped mice (Rhabdomys pumilio) following three alternative reproductive tactics: 1. alloparental philopatric males; 2. solitary roaming males, and 3. group-living dominant breeders. Testosterone level increased and corticosterone levels decreased when philopatric males became <b>roamers</b> or breeders. The increase in testosterone levels tended to be higher in philopatric males that became <b>roamers</b> than in philopatric males that became breeders. Testosterone levels decreased when <b>roamers</b> became breeders. Prolactin levels increased when males of any other tactic became breeders. Thus, males significantly changed their hormone profile as they changed tactic. These results are in agreement with the hypothesis that changes in hormone levels are associated with the switch from one alternative reproductive tactic to another...|$|R

The known {{antipathy}} between the races of the red and black man did not exist as between them, though the negro regarded the Indian with some of that self-sufficiency which the domestic servant would be apt to entertain for a savage <b>roamer</b> of the forest; while the Onondago could not but look on my fellow {{as one of the}} freest of the free would naturally feel disposed to look on one who was content to live in bondage.
