25|$|In {{morphological}} dormancy, germination is prevented due to morphological {{characteristics of}} the embryo. In some species, the embryo is just a mass of cells when seeds are dispersed; it is not differentiated. Before germination can take place, both differentiation and growth of the embryo have to occur. In other species, the embryo is differentiated but not fully grown (underdeveloped) at dispersal, and embryo growth up to a species specific length is required before germination can occur. Examples of plant families where morphological dormancy occurs are Apiaceae, Cycadaceae, Liliaceae, Magnoliaceae and <b>Ranunculaceae.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Temperature [...] affects {{cellular}} metabolic {{and growth}} rates. Seeds from different species and even seeds {{from the same}} plant germinate {{over a wide range}} of temperatures. Seeds often have a temperature range within which they will germinate, and they will not do so above or below this range. Many seeds germinate at temperatures slightly above 60-75 F (16-24 C) , while others germinate just above freezing and others germinate only in response to alternations in temperature between warm and cool. Some seeds germinate when the soil is cool 28-40 F (-2 - 4 C), and some when the soil is warm 76-90 F (24-32 C). [...] Some seeds require exposure to cold temperatures (vernalization) to break dormancy. Some seeds in a dormant state will not germinate even if conditions are favorable. Seeds that are dependent on temperature to end dormancy have a type of physiological dormancy. [...] For example, seeds requiring the cold of winter are inhibited from germinating until they take in water in the fall and experience cooler temperatures. Cold stratification is a process that induces the dormancy breaking prior to light emission that promotes germination [...] Four degrees Celsius is cool enough to end dormancy for most cool dormant seeds, but some groups, especially within the family <b>Ranunculaceae</b> and others, need conditions cooler than -5 C. Some seeds will only germinate after hot temperatures during a forest fire which cracks their seed coats; this is a type of physical dormancy.|$|E

60|$|The {{climbing}} {{plants were}} still Panax or Aralia, Kadsura, Saurauja, Hydrangea, Vines, Smilax, Ampelopsis, Polygona, and, most beautiful of all, Stauntonia, with pendulous racemes of lilac blossoms. Epiphytes were rarer, still I found white and purple Caeloynes, and other Orchids, and a most noble white Rhododendron, whose truly enormous and delicious lemon-scented blossoms strewed the ground. The trees were one half oaks, one quarter Magnolias, and nearly another quarter laurels, amongst which grew Himalayan kinds of birch, alder, maple, holly, bird-cherry, common cherry, and apple. The absence of Leguminosae was most remarkable, {{and the most}} prominent botanical feature in the vegetation of this region: it is too high for the tropical tribes of the warmer elevations, too low for the Alpines, and probably too moist for those of temperate regions; cool, equable, humid climates being generally unfavourable to that order. Clematis was rare, and other <b>Ranunculaceae</b> still more so. Cruciferae were absent, and, what was still more remarkable, I found very few native species of grasses. Both Poa annua and white Dutch clover flourished where accidentally disseminated, but only in artificially cleared spots. Of ferns I collected about sixty species, chiefly of temperate genera. The supremacy of this temperate region consists in the infinite number of forest trees, in the absence (in the usual proportion, at any rate) of such common orders as Compositae, Leguminosae, Cruciferae, and <b>Ranunculaceae,</b> and of Grasses amongst Monocotyledons, and in the predominance of the rarer and more local families, as those of Rhododendron, Camellia, Magnolia, Ivy, Cornel, Honeysuckle, Hydrangea, Begonia, and Epiphytic orchids.|$|E
6000|$|Nine other orders, Geraniaceæ, Rhamnaceæ, Rosaceæ, Myrtaceæ, Primulaceæ, Loganiaceæ, Liliaceæ, Thymelaceæ, and Cucurbitaceæ, {{have six}} or seven species each; and among the more {{important}} orders which have less than five species each are <b>Ranunculaceæ,</b> Cruciferæ, Vaccinacæ, Apocynaceæ, Boraginaceæ, Scrophulariaceæ, Polygonaceæ, Orchidaceæ, and Juncaceæ. The most remarkable feature here is the great abundance of Lobeliaceæ, a character of the flora which is probably unique; while the superiority of Labiatæ to Leguminosæ and the scarcity of Rosaceæ and Orchidaceæ are also very unusual. Composites, as in most temperate floras, stand {{at the head of}} the list, and it will be interesting to note the affinities which they indicate. Omitting eleven species which are cosmopolitan, and have no doubt entered with civilised man, there remain nineteen genera and seventy species of Compositæ in the islands. Sixty-one of the species are peculiar, as are eight of the genera; while the genus Lipochæta with eleven species is only known elsewhere in the Galapagos, where a single species occurs. We may therefore consider that nine out of the nineteen genera of Hawaiian {325} Compositæ are really confined to the Archipelago.

60|$|Dr. W. Ogle has {{communicated to}} me a curious case. He {{gathered}} in Switzerland 100 flower-stems {{of the common}} blue variety of the monkshood (Aconitum napellus), {{and not a single}} flower was perforated; he then gathered 100 stems of a white variety growing close by, and every one of the open flowers had been perforated. (11/13. Dr. Ogle 'Popular Science Review' July 1869 page 267. Bailey 'American Naturalist' November 1873 page 690. Gentry ibid May 1875 page 264.) This surprising difference {{in the state of the}} flowers may be attributed with much probability to the blue variety being distasteful to bees, from the presence of the acrid matter which is so general in the <b>Ranunculaceae,</b> and to its absence in the white variety in correlation with the loss of the blue tint. According to Sprengel, this plant is strongly proterandrous (11/14. 'Das Entdeckte' etc. page 278.); it would therefore be more or less sterile unless bees carried pollen from the younger to the older flowers. Consequently the white variety, the flowers of which were always bitten instead of being properly entered by the bees, would fail to yield the full number of seeds and would be a comparatively rare plant, as Dr. Ogle informs me was the case.|$|E
40|$|Nigella sativa, {{belonging}} to the <b>Ranunculacea</b> family, is a versatile phytochemical mine bestowed with multi-dimen sional medicinal effects. The current study was performed to investigate the chemopreventive efficacy, if any, of the ethanolic extract of indigenous Nigella sativa seeds (ENS) and to evaluate its potentials on tumor progression during the initiation and post initiation phases of Dimethylhydrazine-induced colon carcinogenesis in a rat model. ENS treatment during the initiation phase unveiled chemopreventive effect manifested by significant reductions in tumor incidence, multiplicity and tumor volumes. Histopathological findings and modified Duke’s classification of tumors provided evidence that ENS, administered in the initiation phase, is capable of delaying progression, restricting invasion and attenuating aggressiveness of colon tumors. These results imply that ENS may be a promising candidate in the primary prevention of colon cancer. On the contrary, we demonstrated that ENS lacked chemopreventive and tumorigenesis inhibitory effects in the post initiation phase. We speculate that the chemopreventive effect of ENS {{might be due to}} the synergistic actions of various constituents present in the extract. However, extensive studies are warranted and more efforts need to be dedicated to fractionate, analyze and to further appraise the anticancer effect of ENS before any definitive conclusions can be drawn. </p...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Nigella sativa (black seed {{or black}} cumin), which {{belongs to the}} <b>Ranunculacea</b> family, is an annual herb with many {{pharmacological}} properties. Among its many active constituents, thymoquinone (TQ) is the most abundant constituent of the volatile oil of Nigella sativa (N. sativa) seeds, {{and it is the}} constituent to which most properties of this herb are attributed. Methods: PubMed-Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify randomized control trials (RCTs) investigating the therapeutic effects of N. sativa and/or TQ. In this review, we investigated the clinical uses of N. sativa and TQ in the prevention and the treatment of different diseases and morbidity conditions in humans. Results: Black seed and TQ are shown to possess multiple useful effects for the treatment of patients with several diseases, such as inflammatory and auto-immune disorders, as well as metabolic syndrome. Also, other advantages, including antimicrobial, anti-nociceptive and anti-epileptic properties, have been documented. The side effects of this herbal medicine appear not to be serious, so it can be applied in clinical trials because of its many advantages. Conclusion: Some effects of N. sativa, such as its hypoglycemic, hypolipidemic and bronchodilatory effects, have been sufficiently studied and are sufficiently understood to allow for the next phase of clinical trials or drug developments. However, most of its other effects and applications require further clinical and animal studies...|$|R
40|$|Summary. Geographic {{variations}} in the correspondence between diaspore phenotypes and disperser behavior are thought to determine the evolution of plant-animal dispersal mutualisms. Helleborus foetidus is a widely distributed plant in Western Europe, which seeds bear a lipid rich elaio-some attracting ant dispersers. Laboratory cross-tests were conducted to check the correspondence between diaspore phenotypes and ant preference in two localities of the Iberian Peninsula, Caurel and Cazorla, separated by 750 km. Diaspores from Caurel were systematically preferred to those from Cazorla by Formica lugubris (the major disperser at Caurel), and Aphaenogatser iberica and Camponotus cruentatus (both major dispersers at Cazorla). Further bio-assays conducted on A. iberica only showed that differences in elaiosome traits were sufficient to explain ant preference. Separation of the lipid fractions composing the elaiosome revealed that triglycerides, diglycerides and free fatty acids were all dominated by oleic acid. The elaiosomes from Caurel contained relatively more free oleic acid but were less concentrated in linoleyl-containing triglycerides, free palmitic acid and free linoleic acid than those from Cazorla. The three lipid fractions were attractive to ants but dummies soaked with the free fatty acids extracted from Caurel were preferred to those from Cazorla. Taken together, these results reinforce the idea that oleic acid is a major releaser of seed collection by ants and suggest that geographic {{variations in}} free fatty acid composition affect the proba-bility of diaspore removal by ants which in turn potentially determine plant demography.

60|$|The rapidity and {{comparative}} certainty with which such changes as are here supposed do really take place, are well {{shown by the}} great differences in floral structure, as regards the mode of fertilisation, in allied genera and species, and even in some cases in varieties of the same species. Thus in the <b>Ranunculaceae</b> we find the conspicuous part of the flower to be the petals in Ranunculus, the sepals in Helleborus, Anemone, etc., and the stamens in most species of Thalictrum. In all these we have a simple regular flower, but in Aquilegia it is made complex by the spurred petals, and in Delphinium and Aconitum it becomes quite irregular. In the more simple class self-fertilisation occurs freely, but it is prevented in the more complex flowers by the stamens maturing before the pistil. In the Caprifoliaceae we have small and regular greenish flowers, as in the moschatel (Adoxa); more conspicuous regular open flowers without honey, as in the elder (Sambucus); and tubular flowers increasing in length and irregularity, till in some, like our common honeysuckle, they are adapted for fertilisation by moths only, with abundant honey and delicious perfume to attract them. In the Scrophulariaceae we find open, almost regular flowers, as Veronica and Verbascum, fertilised by flies and bees, but also self-fertilised; Scrophularia adapted in form and colour to be fertilised by wasps; and the more complex and irregular flowers of Linaria, Rhinanthus, Melampyrum, Pedicularis, etc., mostly adapted to be fertilised by bees.|$|E
60|$|The {{question}} next arises, whether, as all Kinds {{must have}} a place among the classes, so all the classes in a natural arrangement must be Kinds? And to this I answer, certainly not. The distinctions of Kinds are not numerous enough {{to make up the}} whole of a classification. Very few of the genera of plants, or even of the families, can be pronounced with certainty to be Kinds. The great distinctions of Vascular and Cellular, Dicotyledonous or Exogenous and Monocotyledonous or Endogenous plants, are perhaps differences of kind; the lines of demarcation which divide those classes seem (though even on this I would not pronounce positively) to go through the whole nature of the plants. But the different species of a genus, or genera of a family, usually have in common {{only a limited number of}} characters. A Rose does not seem to differ from a Rubus, or the Umbelliferæ from the <b>Ranunculaceæ,</b> in much else than the characters botanically assigned to those genera or those families. Unenumerated differences certainly do exist in some cases; there are families of plants which have peculiarities of chemical composition, or yield products having peculiar effects on the animal economy. The Cruciferæ and Fungi contain an unusual proportion of nitrogen; the Labiatæ are the chief sources of essential oils, the Solaneæ are very commonly narcotic, etc. In these and similar cases there are possibly distinctions of Kind; but it is by no means indispensable that there should be. Genera and Families may be eminently natural, though marked out from one another by properties limited in number; provided those properties are important, and the objects contained in each genus or family resemble each other more than they resemble any thing which is excluded from the genus or family.|$|E
