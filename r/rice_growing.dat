5|$|In 1771, the Tây Sơn {{rebellion}} {{erupted from}} Bình Định Province. In 1777, {{the last of}} the Nguyễn lords was deposed and killed. His nephew Nguyen Phuc Anh was the most senior member of the Nguyễn family to have survived the Tây Sơn victory and conquest of Saigon in 1777. Nguyễn Ánh fled to Hà Tiên in the far south of the country, where he met Pigneau de Behaine, a French priest who became his adviser and played a large part in his rise to power. Over the next few decades, there were continuous attacks and counterattacks by both sides and Saigon changed hands frequently. Eventually, Nguyễn Ánh was forced him into exile. The Tây Sơn regularly raided the <b>rice</b> <b>growing</b> areas of the south during the harvesting season, confiscating the Nguyễns' supply of food.|$|E
5|$|In October 1782, {{the tide}} shifted again, when forces led by Nguyễn Phúc Mân, Nguyễn Ánh's younger brother, and Châu Văn Tiếp drove the Tây Sơn out of Saigon. Nguyễn Ánh {{returned}} to Saigon, as did Pigneau The hold was tenuous, and a counterattack by the Tây Sơn in early 1783 saw a heavy defeat for the Nguyễn, with Nguyen Man killed in battle. Nguyễn Ánh again fled to Phú Quốc, {{but this time}} his hiding place was discovered. He managed to escape the pursuing Tây Sơn fleet to Koh Rong island in the Bay of Kompong Som. Again, his hideout was discovered and encircled by the rebel fleet. However, a typhoon hit the area, and he managed to break the naval siege and escape to another island amid the confusion. In early 1784, Nguyễn Ánh went to seek Siamese aid, which was forthcoming, but the extra 20,000 men failed to weaken the Tây Sơn's hold on power. This forced Nguyễn Ánh to become a refugee in Siam in 1785. To make matters worse, the Tây Sơn regularly raided the <b>rice</b> <b>growing</b> areas of the south during the harvesting season, depriving the Nguyễn of their food supply. Nguyễn Ánh eventually {{came to the conclusion}} that using Siamese military aid would generate a backlash amongst the populace, due to prevailing Vietnamese hostility towards Siam.|$|E

25|$|About 1500 BCE, {{people in}} the region were turning copper into bronze, growing rice, and domesticating {{chickens}} and pigs; they were among the first {{people in the}} world to do so. By 500 BCE, iron-working settlements emerged in an area south of present-day Mandalay. Bronze-decorated coffins and burial sites filled with earthenware remains have been excavated. Archaeological evidence at Samon Valley south of Mandalay suggests <b>rice</b> <b>growing</b> settlements that traded with China between 500 BC and 200 CE.

25|$|Vang Pao moved three battalions {{back into}} a fertile <b>rice</b> <b>growing</b> area, the Muong Ngan valley. Next, he {{received}} reinforcements from the Royal Lao Army. With the 103rd Bataillon Parachutiste (103rd Parachute Battalion) added to the irregulars, the combined force moved down from their hill position to Phonsavan on 29 April. In {{the ruins of the}} town smashed by artillery and air strikes, they found two BTR-40 Armored Cars, 18 other vehicles, 12 37mm antiaircraft guns, and a 75mm howitzer, which they destroyed. Continuing through town two kilometers to the northwest, {{on the north side of}} Route 4 they uncovered a cave complex crammed with pre-positioned communist supplies. Behind barrels of rocks barricading cave entrances against air attack, they found 300 tons of medical supplies. Another cave contained hospital beds for 1,000 patients. Still another contained over a mile of supplies within it; as the cache was too big to ruin, local Buddhist monks were convinced to lay a curse upon it so the superstitious Pathet Lao would not reclaim the goods. There were operating theaters; one had a pair of X-ray machines. Air America flew in a cargo of varied explosives to destroy the goods. The 1,000 Hmong troops occupied Phonsavan for the first time since 1962; they did not have to fire a shot.|$|E
25|$|The {{landscape}} of the river basins is a very wide, flat, well-watered plain continuously refreshed with soil and sediment brought down by the rivers. The lower central plain from the delta north to Ang Thong Province is a flat, low area {{with an average of}} two metres above sea level. Further north and into the plains of the Ping and the Nan the elevation is over 20 m. Then the mountains that are the natural boundary of the Chao Praya watershed form a divide, which has, to some degree, historically isolated Thailand from other Southeast Asian civilisations. In northern Thailand the divide roughly corresponds to a long section of the political border of the country today. Southern portions of the divide's boundary correspond less to the nation's political border, because isolation in this area was prevented by the ease of transportation along the lowlands surrounding the Gulf of Thailand, allowing a unified Thai civilisation to extend beyond the watershed without issue. The slightly higher northern plains have been farmed for centuries and saw a major change from the 13th century during the Sukhothai Kingdom in the 13th and 14th centuries and the Ayutthaya Kingdom that succeeded it when <b>rice</b> <b>growing</b> intensified with the introduction of floating rice, a much faster-growing strain of rice from Bengal. The southern swamps meanwhile changed radically from the 18th century when King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke moved the capital of Siam to Bangkok, and a process of canalisation and cultivation began, especially as Thailand began to export rice from 1855.|$|E

500|$|First {{appearing}} in East Africa in 1891, rinderpest, {{a disease of}} cattle, spread rapidly across Africa. By 1892, 95 per cent of the cattle in East Africa had died. This resulted in a famine that devastated the farmers and nomadic people, {{some of whom were}} entirely dependent on their cattle. Two thirds of the population of Maasai people died. The situation was made worse by epidemics of smallpox that followed {{in the wake of the}} famine. In the early years of the 20th century rinderpest was common in Asia and parts of Europe. The prevalence of the disease was steadily reduced during the century by control measures that included vaccination. By 1908 Europe was free from the disease. Outbreaks did occur following the Second World War, but these were quickly controlled. The prevalence of the disease increased in Asia, and in 1957 Thailand had to appeal for aid because so many buffaloes had died that the paddy fields could not be prepared for <b>rice</b> <b>growing.</b> Russia west of the Ural Mountains remained free from the disease– Lenin approved several laws on the control of the disease– but cattle in eastern Russia were constantly infected with rinderpest that originated in Mongolia and China where the prevalence remained high. India controlled the spread of the disease, which had retained a foothold in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, throughout the 20th century, and had eradicated the disease by 1995. Africa suffered two major panzootics in the 1920s and 1980s. There was a severe outbreak in Somalia in 1928 and the disease was widespread in the country until 1953. In the 1980s, outbreaks in Tanzania and Kenya were controlled by the use of 26million doses of vaccine, and a recurrence of the disease in 1997 was suppressed by an intensive vaccination campaign. By the end of the century rinderpest had been eradicated from most countries. A few pockets of infection remained in Ethiopia and Sudan, and in 1994 the Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme was launched by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) with the aim of global eradication by 2010. In May 2011, the FAO and the World Organisation for Animal Health announced that [...] "rinderpest as a freely circulating viral disease has been eliminated from the world." ...|$|E
