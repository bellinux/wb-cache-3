5000|$|There {{were two}} {{different}} types of high performance brake systems on offer for the C4 S4. [...] All S4s' initially had 310 mm diameter by 25 mm thick, radially ventilated disc brakes up front, each with an ATE single-piston sliding caliper inside a 'UFO' styled bell-shaped disc. With the introduction of the V8 engine, a new front brake setup became standard; again the discs used <b>radial</b> <b>ventilation,</b> but these front discs were now sized at 314 mm by 30 mm - with a conventionally mounted Lucas-Girling caliper in an external position over the disc. US models had smaller 276 mm discs. The rear brakes, 269 mm by 20 mm and also radially ventilated - remained the same throughout C4 production; they used a Lucas-Girling single-piston sliding caliper with an integrated cable-actuated handbrake mechanism. A Bosch three-channel operation (four-channel sensing) Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with a mechanical load sensing valve for the rear brakes was standard throughout production.|$|E

For {{the complex}} status of fluid flow in stator <b>radial</b> <b>ventilation</b> ducts of large turbo-generator, the {{temperature}} distribution of stator is dramatically {{affected by the}} flow status of cooling medium in stator ventilating ducts. In this paper, a new ventilating ducts structure in stator is investigated. According to fixing a wind deflector on the stator teeth adjacent to the ventilation ducts, the fluid flow status of cooling air is changed flowing in stator ventilation ducts. For this reason, the effect of heat transfer in stator is changed. Taking an air-cooled turbo-generator as an example, considering the characteristics of fluid flow and heat transfer in turbo-generator ventilation system, the three-dimensional fluid flow and heat transfer coupling model is established. Using finite volume method, three-dimensional fluid field and temperature field control equations are coupling solved. Based on this, the velocity distribution in ventilating ducts is obtained. Besides that, the velocity distribution is studied with the cooling air flows into <b>radial</b> <b>ventilation</b> ducts at different incident angles. The influences of wind deflector and incident angles on the fluid velocity and temperature distribution are analyzed. Based on that, some useful conclusions are obtained...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Averaged 3 D N-S {{equations}} and RNG k-Îµ equations were solved with {{parallel computing}} CFD code on the flow field of dual <b>radial</b> <b>ventilation</b> system without fan for a hydro-generator. The MRF(multiple implicit rotating frame) method {{was used to}} simulated the rotating motion of the generator and porous media model were used to simulate the pressure loss of air cooler. Rational tactics were selected to generate calculation grids to compromise with calculation CPU time and result accuracy and the grids of different parts were generated with ICEM-CFD. The flow characteristic of different parts was analyzed and flow flux of different section was obtained. The research indicated that the flow from leakage gap between poles and stators formed "air wall", which generated a recirculation zone and made the bar cooling bad. The local pressure loss of stator entrance is dominant. There are leeward and windward areas for the air flowing with circumferential velocity component. Rational design of stator ducts entrance with some diversion effect, can reduce the pressure loss of the stator ventilation and improve the cooling of leeward area in stator ducts...|$|E
