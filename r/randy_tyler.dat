50|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of NWA-TRW, former color commentator Ladies' Choice was named as the new General Manager of ECCW on December 16, 2006 in Vancouver. Not surprisingly, {{following the lead of}} previous heel authority figures in major promotions like World Wrestling Entertainment and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, LC has shown blatant favoritism toward heel wrestlers and abused the power of his office, in particular actively attempting to protect the title reign of NWA/ECCW Champion <b>Randy</b> <b>Tyler</b> (who had held the title since January 27, 2006, when he was awarded the belt without wrestling for it, after tricking Sweet Daddy Devastation into signing a contract giving the championship to Tyler if SDD defeated then-champion Juggernaut) from the challenges of popular contenders like Aaron Idol by doing all in his power to prevent those contenders from receiving title shots. LC's luck in keeping the championship on Tyler finally ran out on June 22, 2007 when Idol defeated Tyler in a steel cage match in Surrey to win the title, {{thanks in part to the}} involvement of the returning Sweet Daddy Devastation, who slammed the cage door into the escaping Tyler as payback for Tyler's duplicity. Not long after Idol's title win, Ladies' Choice resigned as General Manager and left ECCW.|$|E

5000|$|In the semi-finals, {{she sang}} [...] "Reflection" [...] by Christina Aguilera. Her {{performance}} received praise from the judges, with Lopez saying that Hollie {{could win the}} show, while Steven Tyler wanted her to let her hair down, but called her performance beautiful. Amy Sciaretto from PopCrush wrote that [...] "Shes a frontrunner, and she attempted to slay a pretty big dragon, since Xtina is so difficult to emulate due to her range. While there were some slightly off parts, Cavanagh still handled it like a diva-in-training." [...] Cavanagh was advanced to the following week by voters, and during the Top 13 performance show, she sang Whitney Houstons version of [...] "All the Man That I Need". <b>Randy</b> Jackson and <b>Tyler</b> {{told her that she}} nailed Houstons song, while Lopez lauded her saying, [...] "That’s the Hollie that I know. Youre the one. We might have a sing off between two girls in the finale, and that’s what I want!" [...] For the Top 11 performance show, Cavanagh once again earned praise singing Celine Dions [...] "The Power of Love". In her mentoring session with will.i.am and Jimmy Iovine, will.i.am and Iovine were both extremely impressed with Cavanaghs range, saying [...] "Where’s all that power coming from? ... You got amplifiers in your pockets?" [...] Tyler commented [...] "I dont know where your voice comes from. It’s heaven above", while Jackson and Lopez, while praising the performance, pointed out minor pitch issues, though Jackson said that she blew the song out of the box. [...] Brian Mansfield from USA Today commented that [...] "She knows she hasnt made a safe choice, but she says nows not the time to play safe. Lots of big ballads tonight, but I think Hollies may be the best." ...|$|R
5000|$|It {{was during}} this time that the company adopted a {{rigorous}} touring schedule, often running up to 15 shows a month across British Columbia. Playing in towns of all sizes in the province, many of these touring shows were fundraisers for various schools or charities. A collection {{of one of these}} tours, The Northern Hell Tour, was made available as a multiple volume set of VHS video cassettes. The company also began running an annual summertime event at the North Surrey Rec Centre in Surrey, British Columbia, the first of which saw then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Dan Severn defeat [...] "Ironman" [...] Mike Roselli in the main event. During this period of the company's history, they heavily relied on rabid fans and a blend of hardcore-style veterans such as Billy Two Eagles and [...] "Maniac" [...] Matt Borne, young up-and-comers such as Tony Kozina, El Antorcha, Strife, and Chance Beckett, and wrestling purists such as [...] "Rocket" [...] <b>Randy</b> <b>Tyler</b> and Doby Gillis. Other talent used during this period included Louie Spicolli, Tommy Rogers, and Dan Severn as touring NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Owing to the promotion's very name, which was a means to ride on the success Extreme Championship Wrestling was having across the Northeastern United States, it was not rare to see chairs, tables, and barbed wire at ECCW events.|$|E
