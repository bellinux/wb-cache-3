50|$|Since the {{position}} of the laser is known exactly by the controller, {{it is not necessary to}} add barriers to the surface to prevent the laser from deviating from the prescribed engraving pattern. As a result, no <b>resistive</b> <b>mask</b> is needed in laser engraving. This is primarily why this technique is different from older engraving methods.|$|E
30|$|The {{recording}} of periodic structures on photoresist films {{was carried out}} using the interference pattern formed with a helium-cadmium laser (wavelength λ[*]=[*] 441.6  nm) using the holographic setup assembled by the wave-amplitude division method. After exposure, the samples were chemically treated in non-water alkaline organic solutions to form a <b>resistive</b> <b>mask</b> in the photoresist layer, through which the metal film was etched. By varying the etching time of Au layer, {{it was possible to}} change the depth of the relief thus formed gratings. The Au grating structures with different depth of relief were obtained after removing the photoresist residues in alkaline solution, washing, and drying.

30|$|The {{recording}} of periodic structures on annealed ChG films {{was carried out}} using the interference pattern formed with a helium-cadmium laser (wavelength λ[*]=[*] 440  nm). The exposition value for the gratings recording (1 D structures) was 0.2 – 0.5  J/cm 2, and during the {{recording of}} the bi-gratings (2 D structures), each exposition was decreased by 1.3 – 1.5 times. Two-dimensional periodic structures were formed by double exposure with {{the rotation of the}} sample between expositions on 90 ° around the normal. After exposure, the samples were chemically treated in non-water alkaline organic solutions to form a <b>resistive</b> <b>mask</b> in photoresist layer, through which the metal film was etched.

40|$|Application of {{inorganic}} photoresist {{based on}} chalcogenide films for fabrication of submicrometer periodic relief on silicon wafers was investigated. For this purpose, technological process of <b>resistive</b> two-layer chalcogenide-Cr <b>mask</b> formation on a silicon surface was developed, and silicon anisotropic etching was optimized, too. This {{technology has been}} used for the fabrication of high-quality diffraction gratings on Si (100) surface with symmetric triangular and trapezium grooves and two-dimentional periodic structures. Relief parameters and diffraction properties of the obtained structures and their dependences on etching time were determine...|$|R
30|$|Ordered {{nanostructure}} arrays {{have attracted}} considerable attention {{due to their}} unique properties and potential applications in such as data storage [1], biosensors [2], catalysis [3], and photonic crystals [4, 5]. For example, cobalt nanobowl arrays show enhanced coercivity in comparison with spherical particles due to shape effects [6]. However, how to effectively and economically produce such nanostructures in a large area is still a big challenge, even though electron beam lithography, focused ion beam (FIB), and X-ray lithography {{have been widely used}} in nanofabrication due to their high resolution. To this end, nanoimprinting lithography (NIL) and nanosphere lithography (NSL), as two low-cost and high-throughput techniques, have been extensively studied in recent time. A high-quality nanoimprint stamp is used in NIL to implement the imprinting, but the stamp fabrication still relies on the aforementioned techniques that are time-consuming and expensive. In the later technique, a monolayer or multilayer of nanospheres is self-assembled and used as the deposition or etch <b>resistive</b> <b>masks.</b> Now, it has been proven to be a promising alternative to the conventional top-down fabrication techniques. For example, through the interstitial spacing between the nanospheres, materials are deposited onto the substrate by using various deposition techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [7], electroless deposition [8], atomic layer deposition (ALD) [9], and even molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) [10], which is used to deposit single crystals and fabricate quantum dot arrays [11, 12]. Nanostructures of various shapes such as chains [13], triangles [14], shells [15], rings [16], rods [17], disks [18], and cups [19] have been fabricated on different substrates. Silicon nanopillars were also fabricated using self-assembled nanospheres as a mask in combination with the reactive ion etching (RIE) [20, 21] or deep RIE techniques [22]. Clearly, NSL introduces a controllable way to pattern the substrates but the closely packed nanosphere arrays only work as a shadow mask in most cases and high vacuum chambers are required to perform CVD, e-beam evaporation, sputtering, or ALD, which are expensive and slow processes. In this paper, we present a new scheme to fabricate a metallic master template of ordered nanobowl shape together with a nanobowl structures array–patterned glass substrate. Unlike the reported strategies of using self-assembled polystyrene (PS) nanospheres as mask in literature, a monolayer of PS nanospheres was firstly self-assembled on a gold-coated glass substrate, and then a thin gold film was coated {{on the top of the}} PS nanospheres. Followed by nickel electroforming, a nanobowl-shaped template was electroformed on the top PS hemispheres, and shallow nickel nanobowl arrays were grown on the gold surface beneath the bottom PS hemispheres.|$|R
40|$|Offenders with antisocial {{personality}} disorder (ASPD) are widely assumed to reject psychotherapeutic intervention. Some commentators, therefore, argue {{that those with}} the disorder are better managed {{in the criminal justice}} system, where, following the introduction of indeterminate sentences, engagement with psychological treatment is coercively linked to the achievement of parole. By comparison, National Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines on the management and treatment of ASPD recommend that those who are treatment seeking should be considered for admission to specialist psychiatric hospitals. The rationale is that prison-based interventions are underresourced, and the treatment of ASPD is underprioritised. The justification is that offenders with ASPD can be rehabilitated, if they are motivated. One problem, however, is that little is known about why offenders with ASPD seek treatment or what effect subsequent treatment has on their self-understanding. The aim {{of this paper is to}} address these unresolved issues. It draws on the findings of Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) funded qualitative study examining the experiences of sentenced male offenders admitted to a specialist personality disorder ward within the medium secure estate and the medical practitioners who treat them. The data are analysed with reference to Michel Foucault’s work on governmentality and strategy in power relations. Two arguments are advanced: first, offenders with ASPD are motivated by legal coercive pressures to implement a variety of Foucauldian-type strategies to give the false impression of treatment progress. Second, and related, treatment does not result in changes in self-understanding in the resistive client with ASPD. This presupposes that, in respect of this group at least, Foucault was mistaken in his claim that <b>resistive</b> behaviours merely <b>mask</b> the effectiveness of treatment norms over time. Nevertheless, the paper concludes that specialist treatment in the hospital setting can effect changes in the resistive offender’s self-understanding, but not if the completion of treatment results, as is commonplace, in his prison readmission...|$|R
30|$|The {{recording}} of periodic structures on photoresist films {{was carried out}} using the interference pattern formed with a helium-cadmium laser (wavelength λ[*]=[*] 441.6  nm). The exposition value for the gratings recording was 0.2 – 0.5  J/cm 2. After exposure, the samples were chemically treated in non-water alkaline organic solutions to form a <b>resistive</b> <b>mask</b> in the photoresist layer, through which the metal film was etched. IL technology was applied in a mode of slight overexposure of the photoresist to provide a cycloid form of the groove profile of the periodic chalcogenide mask. By changing the time for selective etching of the photoresist, {{it is possible to}} change the width of the elements of the lithographic masks. Accordingly, the width of the opened intervals between the elements of the mask can be adjusted, through which there is further etching of the metal layer. After removing the photoresist residues in alkaline solution, washing and drying, the metal periodic structure was obtained. Periodic structure was formed only on one half of the chip; the other half remained unetched, i.e., covered with the flat, unstructured gold film. Such samples were prepared for carrying out comparative research using two-channel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) refractometer Plasmon- 71 (V. E. Lashkaryov Institute of Semiconductor Physics NAS of Ukraine) with working wavelength of 850  nm, p-polarized radiation (electric vector in the plane of incidence). This device allows measuring the absolute value of reflectivity as well as the absolute value of the angle in the Kretschmann configuration. The wide range of angles for scanning (up to 17 ° in air) enables quantitative measurements of a reflection curve for liquids with various refraction indexes—from 1.33 (water) up to 1.47 (motor oil) [21].|$|E
