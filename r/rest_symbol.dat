25|$|As {{with the}} notes, {{the shapes of}} the <b>rest</b> <b>symbols</b> in mensural {{notation}} are already similar to their modern descendants (with the smaller values being successively introduced {{in the course of the}} period of mensural notation). The <b>rest</b> <b>symbols</b> of the larger values had a clear visual logic reflecting their time durations, based on the breve rest being a vertical stroke the length of one staff space. For the longa rests, a visual distinction was made depending on whether the longa was imperfect (two breves long) or perfect. Accordingly, their signs were visually twice or three times the length of a breve rest respectively, while the semibreve rest was half that length. Maxima rests, in turn, were groups of two or three longa rests combined. If several longa rests followed each other, groups of either two or three of them were written together on the same staff line to indicate whether they were supposed to be grouped into perfect or imperfect maxima units.|$|R

In this proposed scheme, V candidate symbols are considered at the first layer, and V probable streams are detected with LRD scheme according to the first detected V candidate symbols. Then, the most probable stream is selected through a ML test. Since the proposed scheme can more accurately detect initial symbol and can reduce transmission of error to <b>rest</b> <b>symbols,</b> the proposed scheme shows more improved performance than conventional LRD with very low complexity.

40|$|This {{project is}} an {{outgrowth}} of a larger project that involves the eventual compilation {{of a series of}} Italian madrigals into a modern performing edition. The purpose of this project was to transcribe and edit a madrigal from Carlo Grossi’s L’Anfione musiche da camera or per tavola (Venice, 1675) in order to better understand and be able to perform an Italian madrigal as it might have been done in the late seventeenth century. Through a process of research, examination and transcription, I was able to not only to transcribe Grossi’s music into modern notation but was also able to also have it performed and presented for listeners to hear. Dr. Cobb worked with the original manuscripts at Bologna’s Civico Museo Bibliografico and procured a microfilm copy of a printed copy of the collection dating from 1675. Working from this microfilm, I was able to transcribe the music into modern notation using Sibelius Music Notation Software. Imminent musicologists such as James Griere in his The Critical Editing of Music, point to four principles to consider when undertaking an editing project such as this: 1) editing is critical in nature; 2) criticism, including editing, is based on historical inquiry; 3) editing involves the critical evaluation of the semiotic import of the musical text; and 4) the final arbiter in the critical evaluation of the musical text is the editor’s conception of musical style. Since the music was composed before modern notation practices were established, I had to research early composition techniques using a book by John Caldwell called Editing Early Music. The information found in this resource enabled me to decipher the antiquated <b>rest</b> <b>symbols</b> and note values so that the whole piece would fit together properly. After all the notes were entered into the software program, they were combined with the text, as provided in an Italian translation by Dr. Cobb. While these tasks successfully cultivated a research process, completing these tasks has allowed me to gain further insight into a lesser-known musical mind of the Baroque Era. This project resulted in my being selected to present a joint paper with Dr. Cobb at the recent regional meeting of the College Music Society held on the campus of Cal State Long Beach (March 5, 2016) ...|$|R

The concept of sustainable design is explored as an approach which is here defined as being sensitive to the local and global context. The exhibition and workshop has since 2009 visited different continents and countries to share its content and learn from local projects and people about ways of how to rethink the use of materials. It is exploring how second-hand dresses found in local markets and streets may be used as assets for further transformation. Craft workshops and prototyping labs are created around the collected materials and people are invited to join in. During these workshops participants are encouraged to challenge current structures and ways of thinking around materials and making. The BIG MAMA, a mini-dress similar to an oversized t-shirt is one example of a product which is made in most of the workshops. It is a catalyst element normally brought in to the making process to see how the participants interact with the given materials and each other and how this may vary between different countries.

Vertical Bell Laboratories layered spaces-time (V-BLAST) scheme is widely used to achieve high spectral efficiencies in scattering environments. In V-BLAST systems, receiver design is usually based on the nulling-canceling algorithm which offers a good tradeoff between the computational complexity and system performance.;In this thesis, we propose a nulling-canceling based detection algorithm that performs selective maximum-likelihood decoding. We first compare the symbol estimates from two nulling-canceling implementations with different orders. If the symbol estimates do not agree, then maximum-likelihood detection is performed on the discrepant <b>symbols</b> and the <b>rest</b> of the <b>symbols</b> are detected via nulling and canceling. If there is no discrepancy in the comparison, then only nulling and canceling are performed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{examination}} of Catalan nationalism {{and the use of}} F. C. Barcelona - Barça - in the expression of national sentiments. My way of examining and analysing Football Club Barcelona in this thesis is as a 'dominant symbol' in Turner's terms (1964). By doing this I choose to understand Barça as a thing which generates models and narratives of ones own identity as well other identities 'by association in fact or thought' (Turner: 1964 : 20). I believe that my thesis provides the reader with some settings where national sentiments are articulated and pinpointed through the football-field. The analogous character between the discourses of football and national discourses and the way they both mirror the main Catalan narrative of the suppressed, stigmatised, yet surviving, modern and successful nation is partially the focus of this thesis. The natural use of the division between Catalan values and those belonging to Spaniards, though too general a category, and the way these ideas pervade the football field, show us how old antagonisms on which national images rest are reproduced as aspects of modern life. The repetitive character of football provides the national narrative with an emotional setting for the articulation of belonging, identity, and opposition towards ideas regarded un-Catalan, which all are located in history and not present day facts. As mentioned above, the strength of Barça as a <b>symbol</b> <b>rests</b> on its performativity, the staging of repetitive emotional rituals that become national moments. Whether the different rituals of football are staged in Camp Nou, down town or when visiting the 'Black Madonna' at Mont Serrat, they are all 'designed' to awake national emotions. In short this thesis has demonstrated how Barça functions as a ritual for the expression of values believed to be essentially Catalan. The way this works is by creating emotional Communitas through the ritual enactment of footballers, where they create bounds of familiarity between them, their organization and the mass-movement surrounding the club. The international football-sphere is however defined by what we can call principles of 'vulgar capitalism', and certainly not close relationships. By creating images of Gemeinschaft through the illusion of masculine imagery in the football sphere, Barça works as a vague, but yet precise enough symbol for identification for the Catalan citizens...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is on finding {{efficient}} decoding methods for Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, i. e., algorithms with acceptable performance and affordable complexity. Three classes of decoders are considered including sphere decoding, belief propagation decoding and interpolation-based decoding. Originally proposed for finding the exact solution of least-squares problems, sphere decoding (SD) is used along with the most reliable basis (MRB) to design an efficient soft decoding algorithm for RS codes. For an (N, K) RS code, given the received vector and the lattice of all possible transmitted vectors, we propose to look for only those lattice points that fall within a sphere centered at the received vector and also are valid codewords. To achieve this goal, we use the fact that RS codes are maximum distance separable (MDS). Therefore, we use sphere decoding {{in order to find}} tentative solutions consisting of the K most reliable code symbols that fall inside the sphere. The acceptable values for each of these symbols are selected from an ordered set of most probable transmitted symbols. Based on the MDS property, K code symbols of each tentative solution can he used to find the <b>rest</b> of codeword <b>symbols.</b> If the resulting codeword is within the search radius, it is saved as a candidate transmitted codeword. Since we first find the most reliable code symbols and for each of them we use an ordered set of most probable transmitted symbols, candidate codewords are found quickly resulting in reduced complexity. Considerable coding gains are achieved over the traditional hard decision decoders with moderate increase in complexity. Due to their simplicity and good performance when used for decoding low density parity check (LDPC) codes, iterative decoders based on belief propagation (BP) have also been considered for RS codes. However, the parity check matrix of RS codes is very dense resulting in lots of short cycles in the factor graph and consequently preventing the reliability updates (using BP) from converging to a codeword. In this thesis, we propose two BP based decoding methods. In both of them, a low density extended parity check matrix is used because of its lower number of short cycles. In the first method, the cyclic structure of RS codes is taken into account and BP algorithm is applied on different cyclically shifted versions of received reliabilities, capable of detecting different error patterns. This way, some deterministic errors can be avoided. The second method is based on information correction in BP decoding where all possible values are tested for selected bits with low reliabilities. This way, the chance of BP iterations to converge to a codeword is improved significantly. Compared to the existing iterative methods for RS codes, our proposed methods provide a very good trade-off between the performance and the complexity. We also consider interpolation based decoding of RS codes. We specifically focus on Guruswami-Sudan (GS) interpolation decoding algorithm. Using the algebraic structure of RS codes and bivariate interpolation, the GS method has shown improved error correction capability compared to the traditional hard decision decoders. Based on the GS method, a multivariate interpolation decoding method is proposed for decoding interleaved RS (IRS) codes. Using this method all the RS codewords of the interleaved scheme are decoded simultaneously. In the presence of burst errors, the proposed method has improved correction capability compared to the GS method. This method is applied for decoding IRS codes when used as outer codes in concatenated code...|$|R
