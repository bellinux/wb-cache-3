In addition, a ducted application eliminates the need for regular replacement of the filters, and avoids the airflow restriction (and resultant loss of power) caused by them. However, ducted application can be impractical, due to lack of space or ability to install a duct system, make-up air requirements, or the additional cost of heating/cooling the make-up air.

Deen diverts some of his time to assist Matt in plumbing the dishwasher, as he wants {{to learn how to do}} plumbing back home. He is then tasked to finish the remainder of the plumbing while Matt himself switches gears to tiling with Angela. The tile job proves to be difficult due to Matt using too much adhesive, making a mess out of the [...] "Delta" [...] tiles in the Delta Upsilon logo as the adhesive comes up between the tiles. Matt's demand for perfection, however, meant that he wants to start the tile job over. As for Simon's task, he takes over 90 minutes in repeatedly installing and uninstalling doors that do not fit due to the openings being unlevel and not plumb.

50|$|An exhaust hood, {{extractor}} hood, or <b>range</b> <b>hood</b> is {{a device}} containing a mechanical fan that hangs above the stove or cooktop in the kitchen. It removes airborne grease, combustion products, fumes, smoke, odors, heat, and steam {{from the air}} by evacuation {{of the air and}} filtration. In commercial kitchens exhaust hoods are often used in combination with fire suppression devices so that fumes from a grease fire are properly vented and the fire is put out quickly. Commercial vent hoods may also be combined with a fresh air fan that draws in exterior air, circulating it with the cooking fumes, which is then drawn out by the hood.|$|E

Pressure tubing is used to measure the fan pressure, and it is also run to the exterior of the building, so that the indoor/outdoor pressure differential can be measured.

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of electricity to the area, the house was lit by gas and heated by coal. To reduce health concerns caused by fumes from these sources, Richards made modifications to improve air circulation. Windows were replaced with ones that could open either upward or downward, so that warmer (polluted) air might escape through the upper opening. Holes were cut in walls an ceilings above lights and heating fixtures to facilitate the removal of combustion byproducts. A master vent was installed at the attic level, and a mechanical ventilation system was installed. A <b>range</b> <b>hood</b> was installed over the stove in the kitchen. As soon as electricity was available in the neighborhood, the Richardses had the house electrified, removing many sources of combustion. They were also among the first in the area to have a telephone.|$|E

5000|$|Range Hoods: In a {{departure}} from the usual procedure, the experts first reveal that the Blue Team's advantage is being able to make one of the other teams start the challenge fifteen minutes later than the rest, and they immediately choose the Red Team, who they regard as their biggest threat. The Blue, Green and Pink Teams are then sent to their cabins, where they discover that the task involves installing a <b>range</b> <b>hood,</b> which entails attaching it to wall studs, connecting it to the electrical supply, and then creating a hole for the hood's exhaust. The teams have 90 minutes (except for the Red Team, who have 75). Believing that they can beat the Red Team regardless, Holly deliberately nullifies the Red Team's disadvantage by openly telling them what the task is. Hillary tells Holly that while this is technically not a violation of the challenge rules, she just threw away their advantage, and Jesse is also less than thrilled to learn what Holly did. Shockingly, three of the four teams end up failing the job. The Green Team fails to finish at all, due to problems with their kitchen layout, and continuing arguments between Jake and Nicole. While the Blue Team end up being the first to finish, the modifications they made to the hood render the fan unable to spin, which ends up destroying the motor. The Pink Team's hood also fails to work, due to Tyler inadvertently damaging the electrical connections during the installation, {{and not being able to}} repair them in time. Despite the Red Team's initial disadvantage, and being further slowed down when Luayn accidentally sustains a deep cut to her hand, the team rally and finish the job flawlessly, and so are the obvious winners.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A novel {{design of}} <b>range</b> <b>hood,</b> which was termed the {{inclined}} quad-vortex (IQV) <b>range</b> <b>hood,</b> was examined for its flow and containment leakage characteristics {{under the influence}} of a plate sweeping across the hood face. A flow visualization technique was used to unveil the flow behavior. Three characteristic flow modes were observed: convex, straight, and concave modes. A tracer gas detection method using sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) was employed to measure the containment leakage levels. The results were compared with the test data reported previously in the literature for a conventional <b>range</b> <b>hood</b> and an inclined air curtain (IAC) <b>range</b> <b>hood.</b> The leakage SF 6 concentration of the IQV <b>range</b> <b>hood</b> {{under the influence of}} the plate sweeping was 0. 039 ppm at a suction flow rate of 9. 4 m 3 /min. The leakage concentration of the conventional <b>range</b> <b>hood</b> was 0. 768 ppm at a suction flow rate of 15. 0 m 3 /min. For the IAC <b>range</b> <b>hood,</b> the leakage concentration was 0. 326 ppm at a suction flow rate of 10. 9 m 3 /min.
