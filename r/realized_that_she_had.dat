5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. The pose shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could only think of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E
5|$|Stephenie Meyer {{says that}} the idea for Twilight came {{to her in a}} dream on June 2, 2003. The dream was about a human girl, and a vampire who was in love with her but thirsted for her blood. Based on this dream, Meyer wrote the {{transcript}} of what is now chapter 13 of the book. Despite having very little writing experience, in a matter of three months she had transformed that dream into a completed novel. After writing and editing the novel, she signed a three-book deal with Little, Brown and Company for $750,000, an unusually high amount for a first time author. Meyer's literary agent, Jodi Reamer of Writers House, discovered her only because the inexperienced assistant who received Meyer's original letter did not know that young adult books are supposed to be 40,000 to 60,000 words in length, not 130,000 words. Megan Tingley, the Little, Brown editor who signed Meyer, said that halfway through the reading of the Twilight manuscript, she <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a future bestseller in her hands. The book was released in 2005.|$|E

25|$|During the Russo-Swedish War (1788–90), Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte {{entered into}} politics. Sweden's ally France was displeased about the war, and Gustav III {{gave her the}} task to act as the go-between in his {{negotiations}} with the French ambassador. In cooperation with {{the daughter of the}} ambassador, her friend Camille du Bois de la Motte, she handled the correspondence between the monarch and the ambassador, arranged secret meetings between them and acted as witness to them upon the King's request. This caused a rift between her and the King when she <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> in fact been used to distract the ambassador. Adolf Fredrik Munck later blackened her {{in the eyes of the}} King by claiming that France was informed about the Swedish war plans through her friendship with Camille du Bois de la Motte. Knowing that her correspondence was read, she maintained a secret correspondence through her own net of couriers.|$|E
500|$|A {{single mother}} with two children, Cher <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> {{to make a}} choice about the {{direction}} of her singing career. Deciding to temporarily abandon her desire to be a rock singer, she signed with Casablanca Records and launched a comeback with the single [...] "Take Me Home" [...] and the album of the same name, both of which capitalized on the disco craze. Both the album and the single became instant successes, remained bestsellers {{for more than half of}} 1979, and were certified gold by the RIAA. Sales of the album may have been boosted by the image of a scantily clad Cher in a Viking outfit on its cover. Despite her initial lack of enthusiasm for disco music, she changed her mind after the success, commenting, [...] "I never thought I would want to do disco... it's terrific! It's great music to dance to. I think that danceable music is what everybody wants." ...|$|E

2500|$|When it {{came time}} to enter high school, Lady Bird had to move away and live with another family during weekdays in the town of Jefferson, Texas, since there was no high school in the Karnack area.

Despite her young age, her father gave her a car so that she could drive herself to school, a distance of [...] each way. She said of that time, [...] "t was an awful chore for my daddy to delegate some person from his business to take me in and out."

In the beginning, the marriage looked successful. The couple set up their home in the Swedish countryside {{in the province of}} Södermanland. They spent the summer there, returning in October to Stockholm. Maria added Swedish to the other five languages she spoke, and became popular in her new country. The Swedes felt she worked harder than her husband did. She was well liked by her father-in-law Gustaf V, who appreciated her [...] "effervescence, charm, and unconventionality." [...] Maria Pavlovna, known in Sweden as the Duchess of Södermanland, [...] was pregnant by the fall, but she quickly <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> little in common with her husband. Their relationship was cold. She had little interest in him and he in her. The couple's only child was born on 8 May 1909.

2500|$|Dunham {{returned}} to Chicago {{in the late}} spring of 1936, and in August was awarded a bachelor's degree, a Ph.B., bachelor of philosophy, with her principal area of study named as social anthropology. She {{was one of the}} first African American women to attend this college and also to earn these degrees. In 1938, using materials collected during her research tour of the Caribbean, Dunham submitted a thesis, [...] "The Dances of Haiti: A Study of Their Material Aspect, Organization, Form, and Function," [...] to the Department of Anthropology at the University of Chicago in partial fulfillment of the requirements for a master's degree, but she never completed her course work or took examinations to qualify for the degree. Devoted to dance performance, as well as to anthropological research, she <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to choose between the two. Although she was offered another grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to pursue her academic studies, she chose dance, gave up her graduate studies, and departed for Broadway and Hollywood.|$|E

2500|$|Around {{the year}} 1589, {{when she was}} 4 years old, she entered the Dominican convent of her {{hometown}} (San Sebastian), with her sisters Isabel and Maria. Erauso's mother's cousi,n Ursula de Uriza and Sarasti, held the position of prioress in the convent. It was normal at that time for girls {{to be placed in}} convents at a young age to be educated according to Catholic tradition, promoting the learning of tasks appropriate to their sex to be subsequently to be betrothed [...] "as God intended". Because of her explosive character and the difficulty the nuns faced to control her, she was transferred to the Convent of San Bartolome de San Sebastian until she was 15, where the rules were much stricter. She <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> no religious vocation, and as a result she felt imprisoned and refused to take her vows. Catalina de Erauso was detained in her cell because of the constant fights she had with a widowed novice named Catalina de Alirli. For this reason, on the night of March 18, 1600, the eve of San Jose, she found the keys of the convent hanging in a corner and used them to escape. She fabricated men's clothing with the materials at her disposal, cut her hair and hid her habit.|$|E
