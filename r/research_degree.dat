25|$|Clinical psychologists, having {{completed}} an undergraduate degree usually in psychology or other social science, generally undergo specialist postgraduate training lasting {{at least two}} years (e.g. Australia), three years (e.g. UK), or four to six years depending how much research activity is included in the course (e.g. US). In countries where the course is of shorter duration, there may be an informal requirement for applicants to have undertaken prior work experience supervised by a clinical psychologist, and a proportion of applicants may also undertake a separate PhD <b>research</b> <b>degree.</b>|$|E

25|$|At {{the age of}} seven, {{authorities}} removed Oscar {{from the}} care {{of her mother and}} placed her into the United Aborigines Mission in Fitzroy Crossing. Recognised by the missionaries as being a clever child, she was later sent for secondary education at John Forrest Senior High School in Perth, before leaving at the age of sixteen to return to Fitzroy Crossing. Oscar didn't think she was capable of studying at tertiary level, but completed a Bachelor of Business degree in 2004 and commenced a PhD <b>research</b> <b>degree</b> in 2011 at University of Notre Dame, Australia.|$|E
25|$|Students {{can choose}} {{from a range of}} {{graduate}} programmes. Most of the above-mentioned undergraduate programmes can be continued with either a general or a specialised graduate program. Leiden University offers more than 100 graduate programs leading to either MA, MSc, MPhil, or LLM degrees. The MPhil. is a special <b>research</b> <b>degree</b> and only awarded by selected departments of the university (mostly in the fields of Arts, Social Sciences, Archeology, Philosophy, and Theology). Admission to these programmes is highly selective and primarily aimed at those students opting for an academic career.|$|E
25|$|The {{latest version}} of the AQF {{includes}} the new category of Level 9 Master's (Extended) degrees which permits {{the use of the}} term 'Doctor' in the styling of the degree title of relevant professional programs. As a result, some Australian medical schools have replaced their MBBS degrees with the MD to resolve the previous anomalous nomenclature. With the introduction of the Master's level MD, universities have also renamed their previous medical research doctorates. The University of Melbourne was the first to introduce the MD in 2011 as a basic medical degree, and has renamed its <b>research</b> <b>degree</b> to Doctor of Medical Science (DMedSc).|$|E

25|$|In 2013-14, 230,805 {{students}} {{studied at}} universities or institutes {{of higher education}} in Scotland, 181,826 of which were full-time, 57.6% were female and 42.4% male, with 67% being domiciled in Scotland, 12% {{from the rest of the}} United Kingdom, and the remaining 21% being international students. Of all these, approximately 151,325 were studying for their first degree (i.e. undergraduate level), 41,925 for a taught postgraduate degree (primarily a Masters degree) and 12,180 for a doctoral <b>research</b> <b>degree</b> (primarily PhD). The remaining 25,375 were mostly on other programmes such as the Higher National Diploma. Of all these, 15,205 were studying in Scotland with The Open University via distance-learning, and the Open University teaches 40 per cent of Scotland's part-time undergraduates.|$|E

500|$|Chadwick {{moved to}} Oxford in 1959, {{to take up}} the {{position}} of Regius Professor of Divinity (and with it the associated canonry at Christ Church Cathedral) at the relatively young age of 39. He was named a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) soon after, and in 1962 Gifford Lecturer at the University of St Andrews lecturing on Authority in the Early Church. He gave a second series of lectures in 1963–4, on Authority in Christian Theology. 1963 also saw him appointed to an early Anglican inquiry into the issues surrounding the ordination of women. In the 1960s, along with scholars like E. R. Dodds, Peter Brown, and John Matthews, Chadwick helped make Oxford a centre in the developing study of Late Antiquity. He clarified the classical philosophical roots of Christian thinkers from Justin Martyr and Clement of Alexandria to Augustine of Hippo, and set about raising academic standards within the theology department—in particular making the degree of Doctor of Divinity (DD) into a genuine <b>research</b> <b>degree,</b> as opposed to an honorary award made to senior clerics who had produced a volume of sermons. 1967 saw the publication of his most widely read work, The Early Church, published under the Pelican imprint of Penguin Books. He was disappointed that he was allowed to include so few footnotes in the original publication, and correspondingly delighted when the publishers of a German edition requested additional notes for their translation. That same year he was appointed to a Church of England doctrine commission investigating [...] "The place of the Articles in the Anglican tradition and the question of Subscription and Assent to them", which produced its report in July 1968 ready for that year's Lambeth Conference. The report ultimately led to changes in the doctrinal affirmations required of Church of England clergy at their ordination or on taking up new appointments. In 1968 he was appointed a vice-president of the British Academy.|$|E

2500|$|In some jurisdictions (e.g., Singapore), it {{is common}} for {{physicians}} to inflate their qualifications with the title [...] "Dr" [...] in correspondence or namecards, even if their qualifications are limited to a basic (e.g., bachelor level) degree. In other countries (e.g., Germany), only physicians holding an academic doctorate may call themselves doctor [...] on the other hand, the European Research Council has decided that the German medical doctorate does not meet the international standards of a PhD <b>research</b> <b>degree.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Returning to England, he {{was head}} of the history {{department}} at Kelly College in Tavistock for five years, followed by fourteen years at Culham College of Education as principal lecturer and head of the history department. He was able to combine his love of cricket with his college duties by instituting the biannual cricket matches between the History Department and his village cricket team of North Moreton for whom he was wicketkeeper and captain. One regularly told story was that he conducted an interview out on the cricket square when one potential teaching student applied who was already on the books of Yorkshire Cricket Club! Unfortunately for Howat, the student did not take up the place which was presumably offered to him, but did go on to have a reasonably successful cricket career. He had an abrupt tutoring technique and once (at least) locked the door when the time of his tutor group was due to start which left only one student in the room (at the magnificent mansion of Nuneham) to enjoy his didactic and engaging teaching style. Meanwhile, he undertook a <b>research</b> <b>degree</b> on [...] "the place of history in education" [...] for Exeter College, Oxford. He also turned his hand to the world of publishing, for a time being general editor of the Historical Division of Pergamon Press.|$|E

The title of this degree varies with the collegiate institution which grants it. Another form of this degree is a Doctor of Science in Nursing (D.S.N.) degree.

5000|$|Research master's degrees are {{primarily}} research based, although may contain taught elements, particularly on research methods.

They aim to prepare students fit research careers.
