40|$|Hopes Smith <b>received</b> <b>parcel</b> sent on 13 October via Mr Sympson {{containing}} {{two letters}} for Smith and three parcels of seed including 'Minuartia campestris', 'Androsace lactea', and 'Lavatera punctata'. Transcribes, in French, conversation with and letter from [Jacob] Wyttenbach about a Berne fireworks display which {{cost more than}} Haller's collections which the Berne authorities had refused to buy; laments that Haller's herbarium is not available for consultation in Berne. Unable to forward Smith's parcel to [Jacques] Dorthes in Montpellier as communications between there and Geneva have ceased. Lists reasons for delays with his book: ill-health, lack of space, greater temptation of the "delightful verdure of the country", bad winter light, expanding his herbarium, caring for his garden, his wife's ill health, death of their first child, and family matters. As foreseen by Smith he was too communicative about his plans and Haller's son has taken advantage: after sending him specimens and observations received a manuscript titled "Tentamen additament" or "ad Hist. Stirp. Helv. " to be printed in a German magazine in Berne containing articles Haller {{had no idea of}} before their "imprudent communications". Infant son in good health...|$|E

40|$|Received Smith's {{letter of}} 2 [February 1787]. Regrets not seeing their "mutual best friend", [Samuel] Goodenough, {{as much as}} he would like to; they have {{described}} about 200 new British insect species but struggle without reference to the Linnaean collections. He has not said anything of the new Society [Linnean Society] other than to [John] Lyon of Dover, [Kent], who has despaired of the present one [Society for the Promotion of Natural History] and is committed to the new. Showed Sir Joseph Banks the section of Smith's letter concerning [Lazzaro] Spallanzani [(1729 - 1799), natural historian] [on dispute between Spallanzani and Giovanni Scopoli over mismanagement of the Univsersity of Pavia museum; Smith was a supporter of Scopoli]; Banks read it aloud to the gentlemen present, including [William] Hudson, L'Héritier, [Olof] Swartz, and [Jonas] Dryander. Swartz has been collecting Jamaican plants and is comparing them with Banks' West India herbarium. Thanks Smith for obtaining some of his 'Lepidotera' desiderata; requests further species. Progress of [William] Jones figures of same; <b>received</b> <b>parcel</b> of insects from China but only contained two 'Papilio' not yet figured by Jones. Discusses [John] Latham's "Le Courent Bris" from his ["General synopsis of birds"]. [James] Dickson had a successful natural history excursion in north of Britain but all his findings were lost in wreck off Dutch coast. A valuable new entomological correspondent, and others. Publication of [William] Curtis' "Botanical Magazine". Recent appointments, including at [Society for Promotion of Natural History] and East India Company.

[Joseph] Gaertner has died but finished his book in second volume ["De fructibus et seminibus plantarum" (1788 - 1805) ], he is very severe on Linnaeus "but a good author may be pardoned for a few prejudices'. Surprised at the attention his "introductory discourse" has received; Father Gregorio Fontana, mathematical professor at Pavia, has translated it into Italian. <b>Received</b> <b>parcel</b> of plants from Botany Bay, many unknown to [Sir Joseph] Banks and others, with coloured drawings of most, and if Banks will not publish his work sees no reason not to publish these. Paper on 'Filices' not quite finished. Considers it settled that 'Trichomanes canariense' is to be 'Davallia'. Sending Davall a "choice copy" of second part of "Icones pictae", a present from Lady Rockingham, and second part of "Spicilegium Botanicum"; hopes he approves of 'Ligusticum cornubiense'.

The Sardars would then divide their parcels among their Surkundas, and then the Surkundas subdivided the land they received among their individual cavalrymen. The Surkundas <b>receiving</b> <b>parcels</b> of land with settlements were required to fortify them and establish fines and laws for their zamindars and ryots.

50|$|After the war {{one of the}} survivors, Dr. Antoni Gościński {{reported}} 62 ways {{of murdering}} people in the camps of Gusen I and Mauthausen. Hans Maršálek estimated that an average life expectancy of newly arrived prisoners in Gusen varied from six months between 1940 and 1942, to {{less than three months}} in early 1945. Paradoxically, with the growth of forced labour industry in various subcamps of Mauthausen, the situation of some of the prisoners improved significantly. While the food rations were increasingly limited every month, the heavy industry necessitated skilled specialists rather than unqualified workers and the brutality of the camp's SS and Kapos was limited. While the prisoners were still beaten on a daily basis and the Muselmänner were still exterminated, from early 1943 on some of the factory workers were allowed to <b>receive</b> food <b>parcels</b> from their families (mostly Poles and Frenchmen). This allowed many of them not only to evade the risk of starvation, but also to help other prisoners who had no relatives outside the camps - or who were not allowed to <b>receive</b> <b>parcels.</b> Inmates were also beaten to death, like Viennese Jew Adolf Fruchthändler.|$|R
