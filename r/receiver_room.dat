However, {{for various reasons}} sound insulation measurements at low frequencies are associated with relatively high uncertainty and wide variance values. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop a method of sound insulation measurement which complements the standard ISO 140 measurement methods by providing improved accuracy at low frequencies. In this paper {{part of the problem is}} considered, namely the measurement of power radiated into the <b>receiver</b> <b>room.</b> The ‘peak envelope method’ is based on mode theory and the measurement employs a pair of microphones in the <b>receiver</b> <b>room</b> and a calibrated volume velocity source. No reverberation time measurements are required. The theory is outlined and computer simulations and trial measurements are carried out in order to validate the theory. Good agreement in numerical and experimental validation is demonstrated.

40|$|Low-frequency {{noise from}} service {{equipment}} in buildings {{tends to be}} of a structure-borne nature rather than an airborne nature. The transmission between different building elements can be determined on a power basis. The injected structure-borne sound power by an installation can be determined by multiplying velocities and contact forces {{in each of the}} installation’s contact points. The velocity can be measured approximately by use of accelerometers close to the contact points, but the measurement of the force is less obvious. Force sensors should be inserted between the installation and the building element, which is often difficult or even impossible. Even when it’s not that tedious, it is advisable not to alter the path of sound transmission, since small changes can imply large differences in injected structure-borne sound power. In this paper, contact forces of a fitness vibration plate are estimated through a structural-acoustic reciprocal method. First, the installation in a source room is put into operation and sound pressures in a <b>receiver</b> <b>room</b> are measured at multiple receiver points. Next, a dedicated volume sound source is placed in the receiver points {{in order to determine the}} transfer functions of the sound source’s volume acceleration to the acceleration of the building element at the position of the contact points. A dedicated volume sound source was used that approximates point source behaviour and produces a high noise level down to very low frequencies (> 20 Hz). This enables accurate measurement of the structure-borne sound transmission. And, in a second step, it allows inverse estimation of the structural-acoustic contact forces down to these low frequencies.

40|$|Background: This Noise control {{case study}} is about problems, {{constraints}} and design solutions for a proposed magnetic resonance imaging system (MRI) installation in an existing medical research facility. This is a companion paper to a structural vibration control case study on the same installation presented by this author at ICSV 10 in 2003. Objective: Manufacturer’s data indicated that airborne sound level emissions over a broad frequency span could exceed permissible noise criteria for nearby occuppied rooms. Previous experience with MRI’s indicated possibility of structure borne vibration induced by airborne sound {{that could result in}} radiated noise in other spaces. Containment design was required for anticipated loud and annoying noises in the magnet room, to prevent excessive or annoying and distracting noise to MRI control room or other adjacent (but unrelated) office spaces. In addition, the structure borne vibration paths needed attenuation or isolation. M e t h o d s: Proposed architectural designs would utilize steel stud framing with gypsum wallboard, and would incorporate continuous sheet copper EMI shielding. The building structure was reinforced concrete. Wall, partition, window, door, air conditioning ducts and other penetration designs were developed to accommodate the required shielding and proposed construction methods.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} models {{based on}} Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA) to predict bending wave vibration in heavyweight buildings from structure-borne sound {{sources such as}} machinery. These sources tend to inject most power in the low- and mid-frequency ranges where the walls and floors have low mode counts and low modal overlap for which calculated Coupling Loss Factors (CLFs) from semi-infinite plate theory can be in error. For machinery {{it is necessary to}} predict vibration on walls/floors that are remote from the source room. In this situation, propagation across successive structural junctions causes spatial filtering of the wave field and the assumption of a diffuse field in each plate subsystem breaks down. The predictive approach described in the European Standard EN 12354 uses SEA path analysis which assumes that transmission is dominated by first-order paths. However the feasibility of extending the concept of path analysis to walls and floors of rooms that are distant from the source room(i. e. not adjacent) is unknown. These issues are addressed in the thesis. The feasibility of SEA path analysis was assessed by quantifying the total contribution to receiver subsystem energy from paths containing specified numbers of CLFs. For receiving subsystems which are attached directly to the source subsystem, the EN 12354 approach was found to underestimate the energy levels. For rooms remote from the source room, path analysis was found to significantly underestimate the vibration of the walls/floors which form the <b>receiver</b> <b>room.</b> Alternative approaches to improve predictions in large heavyweight buildings were assessed through comparison with Monte-Carlo Finite Element Method (MCFEM) models which were validated on a small heavyweight building. Matrix SEA was used with CLFs calculated for L-, T- and X-junctions using analytical models for rectangular plates to try and incorporate modal features. For isolated junctions, there was good agreement with MCFEM but in large buildings. However, it was unable to predict the peaks and troughs in the vibration response to one-third octave band accuracy although it can estimate the envelope response for plates that are directly connected to the source plate. In general, matrix SEA using finite plate theory CLFs does not improve the prediction in one-third octave bands when the statistical mode count is less than unity. Ray tracing was therefore investigated which showed that the angular distribution of power incident on the plate edges differed significantly from a diffuse field. Computationally efficient ray tracing was then developed for inclusion in Advanced SEA (ASEA) models to account for indirect coupling between plate subsystems. ASEA gave significant improvements over matrix SEA when there were large numbers of structural junctions between the source and receiving plates...|$|E
40|$|A {{new digital}} {{receiver}} {{was built for}} the Ooty Radio Telescope (ORT). This new digital receiver system functionally replaces many systems custom-built for various applications at ORT. The thesis presents the receiver design, tests conducted, contributions made, revisions to the receiver architecture and future scopes. The novelty of the receiver design is in treating the ORT as an array of 22 antenna elements. Simulation {{studies were carried out}} to analyze the array performance of ORT. The IF signals are digitized and processed by a combination of multiple FPGAs and computers. Major transport of data in the receiver is through high speed serial communication. Programs were developed for configuration, control, data acquisition and off-line analysis. The functionality of the proposed digital receiver was verified through laboratory tests. The proposed receiver enables several new modes of operation of the ORT and field tests were carried out to verify these features of the system. These tests are briefly described below. The radio waves received on earth from celestial sources are extremely weak and their presence can only be detected by sensitive receivers associated with large radio telescopes. The resulting vulnerability of such observations to the ever increasing presence of radio frequency interference has prompted us to to develop new procedures to identify RFI at ORT through time and frequency domain analysis. The digital receiver has also been used in carrying out RFI study at ORT module level for the first time. Our study demonstrates that a major challenge to realizing the full potential of the ORT will be to detect weakly interfering RFI features and occasionally appearing RFI spikes and correct for their contamination in the observations. The examples provided by our analysis of data collected using the digital receiver are very useful for interpreting the data obtained during sensitive spectral line observations and has already enabled several new studies, the most notable being a sensitive recombination line survey conducted using our digital receiver at ORT as part of another research work. A spectral line emission detection procedure using our receiver has been evolved and an example result obtained by observing a region is presented in the thesis. Formation of phased array of ORT modules using the digitized IF signal is discussed and its implementation is verified through observation of celestial sources. An important requirement for proper phasing of the array is the calibration of differential delay/phase variations across the modules of the ORT, for which a powerful method was implemented based on the cross correlation of signals arriving at the 22 modules. This new method employs Hilbert Transform technique to introduce phase information in the sampled signal and the estimated delay and phase corrections are found to be consistent and repeatable. An interplanetary scintillation observation was made with the phased array and the resultant fluctuation spectra obtained are presented. Several pulsar observations and continuum sources have been observed and the results are presented. Another notable feature of the proposed digital receiver is the enhanced field of view which will lead to a reduced observing time observing extended regions. The improved spectral and temporal resolutions have also been demonstrated by the observations presented in the thesis. In particular, the single pulse observations of pulsars reported in the thesis were enabled by the high time resolution supported by the receiver [...] The present work also demonstrated the digital beam formation with ORT modules in arbitrary directions. The digitally synthesized beam was compared within the first null positions of the central analog beam (beam- 7) of ORT and the result is reported in the thesis. The new digital receiver enabled all the above mentioned analyses which were carried {{out for the first time}} at ORT. The results of the field trials emphasized the need for future observations to include RFI monitoring and characterization as part of the observing strategy and continuously evolve the algorithms for RFI mitigation by using different statistical signatures of the celestial signals. The need for providing a layer of buffering and preprocessing before the final beam formation or correlation is emphasized. To facilitate such development in the future, the final operational system provides for software based correlator which can be developed using the algorithms presented in this thesis. This transforms our original target of a reconfigurable platform to a much more flexible re-programmable platform. In particular, this simplifies the application of windowing functions and polyphase filters to control the beam shapes to (a) reduce beam dilution effects and, (b) to enhance RFI rejection by side lobe suppression. Such techniques can be used to reduce spectral leakage and reduce the effect of RFI on adjacent frequency channels in critical observations. Our receiver is adequate for realizing the maximum potential of the IF signals entering the <b>receiver</b> <b>room.</b> Any further enhancement of the ORT spectral coverage and instantaneous sky coverage will require telescope's front end modification and digitization of signals at the RF stage. The real time processing capabilities can be further enhanced by using multi-core processors and multi gigabit ethernet interfaces that are starting to appear as commodity hardware. Thus the present work opens up several new avenues for future work...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Reverberation {{in rooms}} is often {{simulated}} {{with the image}} method due to Allen and Berkley (1979). This method has an asymptotic complexity that is cubic {{in terms of the}} simulated reverberation length. When employed in the frequency domain, it is relatively computationally expensive if there are many <b>receivers</b> in the <b>room</b> or if the source or receiver positions are changing with time. The computational complexity of the image method is due to the repeated summation of the fields generated by a large number of image sources. In this paper, a fast method to perform such summations is presented. The method is based on multipole expansion of the monopole source potential. For offline computation of the room transfer function for image sources and receiver points, use of the Allen–Berkley algorithm requires @ A operations, whereas use of the proposed method requires only @ C A operations, resulting in significantly faster computation of reverberant sound fields. The proposed method also has a considerable speed advantage in situations where the room transfer function must be rapidly updated online in response to source/receiver location changes. Simulation results are presented, and algorithm accuracy, speed, and implementation details are discussed. For problems that require frequency-domain computations, the algorithm is found to generate sound fields identical to the ones obtained with the frequency-domain version of the Allen–Berkley algorithm at a fraction of computational cost.

5000|$|In {{the season}} opener at #12 California, he caught one pass for 28 yards and made two rushing {{attempts}} for 16 yards. Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80 yards, rushed twice for 22 yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127 yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "To be honest with you, I was kind of expecting more out of Torrey. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. But I think if you asked Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too." [...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide <b>receiver,</b> he had <b>room</b> for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165 yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112 yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64 yards and a 29-yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000 all-purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194 yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70 yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, [...] "This kid is probably a better receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey. He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He can hurt you running the ball or catching it. Everywhere you look, he's a problem." ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a mobile optical {{wireless}} system that employs beam delay adaptation, and {{makes use of}} our previously introduced beam angle and power adaptation multi-beam spot diffusing configuration in conjunction with an imaging receiver. Our {{ultimate goal is to}} improve the bandwidth, reduce the effect of intersymbol-interference, and increase the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the transmitter operates at a higher data rate under the impact of multipath dispersion, background noise, and mobility. A significant reduction in the delay spread can be achieved compared to a conventional diffuse system (CDS) when an imaging receiver replaces a nonimaging <b>receiver</b> at the <b>room's</b> corner, where the delay spread is reduced from 2. 4 ns to about 0. 35 ns. Our proposed system, beam delay, angle, and power adaptation in a line strip multibeam spot diffusing configuration (BDAPA- LSMS), offers a reduction in delay spread by a factor of more than 10 compared with only the beam angle and power adaptation LSMS. An increase in channel bandwidth from 36 MHz (CDS) to about 9. 8 GHz can be achieved when our methods of beam delay, angle, and power adaptation coupled with an imaging receiver are employed. These improvements enhance our system and enable it to operate at a higher data rate of 10 Gb/s. At a bit rate of 30 Mb/s, our proposed BDAPA-LSMS achieves about 50 dB SNR gain over conventional diffuse systems that employ a nonimaging receiver (CDS). Moreover, our simulation results show that the proposed BDAPA-LSMS at a bit rate of 10 Gb/s achieves about 32. 3 dB SNR at the worst communication path under the presence of background noise and mobility while achieving a bit error rate below 10 - 9...|$|R

A social {{response}} {{was defined as}} a discriminated operant which includes the behavior of more than one organism in a group and i at least partly under the control of stimuli produced by the group itself. 	The {{purpose of the study was}} to examine the relationship between reinforcement and the rate of one kind of social response, namely the serial order of the speakers in a conversation. It was assumed that the laws of learning discovered in the study of the behavior of individual organisms would be sufficient to account for this aspect of group behavior, requiring no further theoretical assumptions. When the {{response was}} followed by a reinforcing stimulus it was expected to occur more often. When, subsequently, the response was permitted to occur in the absence of reinforcement its rate was expected to decline. 	Method. Subjects were asked to come to a series of unanimous decisions about which of several stimuli to try to communicate telepathically to a <b>receiver</b> in another <b>room.</b> After each consensus they were to stop talking immediately, concentrate on that stimulus, and wait silently to be informed whether or not their message was received. After a three-second delay they were signalled whether or not their message had been received correctly and went on to try again. 	Each consensus constituted a trial, of which there were 700 in all during seven days. A record was kept of the identity and order of the last two subjects to speak in each trial. In a thee-person group there are six possible two 0 person trial endings. One of these endings (AB) was the social response studied. 	On the first two days the "correct" signal (positive reinforcing stimulus) was sounded after one quarter of the trials on a random schedule, in order to establish a baseline rate for AB. 	Days three to five were the conditioning period, during which AB was reinforced whenever it occurred. [TRUNCATED...|$|R
40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment ofthe requirements for the degree of Doctor of PhilosophyFor most {{of the second half}} of the 20 th century the world's political map was divided by the Cold War, a name given to the 40 -year long standoff between the superpowers - the Unites States and the USSR - and their allies. Due to its geographical location and alliance with the United States, Britain was at the 'frontline' of the Cold War. As a response to increasing tensions, the British Government made arrangements by building hundreds of military sites and structures, which were often dismantled or abandoned as the technology on which they relied became rapidly ineffective. Nowadays, there is a growing (academic) recognition of Cold War sites and their new or contemporary uses, including as heritage attractions within a tourism context. This study has brought forward a constructionist approach as to investigate how heritage works as a cultural and social practice that constructs and regulates a range of values and ideologies about what constitutes Cold War heritage (and) tourism in Britain. It has done this by, firstly, exploring the dominant and professional 'authorised heritage discourse', which aims to construct mutually, agreed and shared concepts about the phenomenon of 'Cold War heritage' within a tourism context. The study identified a network of actors, values, policies and discourses that centred on the concept of 'Cold War heritage' at selected sites through which a 'material reality' of the past is constructed. Although various opposing viewpoints were identified, the actors effectively seem to privilege and naturalise certain narratives of cultural and social meanings and values through tourism of what constitutes Cold War heritage and the ways it should be manifested through material and natural places, sites and objects within society. Differences were particularly noticeable in the values, uses and meanings of Cold iii Cold War heritage (and) tourism War heritage within the contemporary context of heritage management in Britain. For some, the sites were connected with a personal 'past', a place to commemorate, celebrate or learn from the past. For others, the sites were a source of income, a tourism asset, or contrary, a financial burden as the sites were not 'old enough' or 'aesthetically pleasing' to be regarded as a monument to be preserved as heritage. Subsequently, the study also explored the (disempowered) role of visitors to the sites as passive <b>receivers,</b> leaving little <b>room</b> for individual reflections on the wider social and cultural processes of Cold War heritage. Although, most visitors believed that the stewardship and professional view of the Cold War representations at the sites should not directly be contested, this study has illustrated the idea that what makes places valuable and gives them meaning as heritage sites is not solely based on contemporary practices by a dominant heritage discourse. Despite the visitors' support for the sole ownership by site managers, and the selective representations of the Cold War and events, they did question or negotiate the idea of 'heritage' as a physical and sole subject of management practices. Despite having little prior knowledge about the Cold War era or events, by pressing the borders of the authorised parameters of 'Cold War heritage', visitors actively constructed their experiences as being, or becoming, part of their personal and collective moments of 'heritage'. By inscribing (new) memories and meaning into their identity, and therefore also changing the nature of that identity, they reflected upon the past, present and future, (some more critically than others. To conclude, understanding these discursive meanings of Cold War heritage (and) tourism, and the ways in which ideas about Cold War heritage are constructed, negotiated and contested within and between discourses also contributes to understandings about the philosophical, historical, conceptual and political barriers that exist in identifying and engaging with different forms of heritage...|$|R
