40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{technique}} for preparing vermiculites for examination by high-resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HRTEM) has been developed. A TEM-stable expanded phase {{can be obtained by}} intercalating n-alkylammonium ions between the silicate layers of a parent biotite. The vermiculite particles were embedded in Spurr resin and centrifuged to improve orientation. Ultra-thin specimens were prepared using an ultramicrotome, the quality and thickness of the sections being monitored by TEM. Lattice images of biotite, Ba-vermiculite and octylammonium-vermiculite, the latter showing aperpendicular <b>rangement</b> of the alkyl chains relative to the silicate layers, were obtained with a resolution ~ 2 A. The reliability of these images was confirmed by computer simulation. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for investigating structural defects and deformations in layer-silicates (Brown & Rich, 1968; Lee et al., 1975; Amouric et al., 1981; Vali & K 6 ster, 1986). Whereas X-ray or neutron diffraction can characterize the overall structure without providing any information about the spatial distribution of structural inhomogeneities, HRTEM permits direct observation of microstructural features such as regular or random interstratification formed during th...|$|E

So, the new gauge is bounded and correspondingly non-Gaussian. We use the new stability gauge in nonlinear panel estimates to examine the post- Bretton Woods period, and we find that trilemma policy stability is linked to official holdings of foreign exchange reserves in low income countries. We also find {{that the combination of}} fixed exchange rates and financial market openness is the most stable arrangement within the trilemma; and middle-income countries have less stable trilemma arrangements than either low or high-income countries.

Navy DT- 60 {{dosimeter}} {{was evaluated}} under field type conditions {{as to its}} reproducibility and accuracy of gamma x-ray, thermal and fast neutron and mixed radiation responses. Gamma and x-ray responses from 25 to 600 rads at energies in oxcess of 200 kev {{were found to be}} accurate within 20 % in 92 % of 160 dosimeters examined. Because the DT- 60 was found to have no detectable fast neutron response, effort was directed toward exaggerating the thermal neutron response to approximate the total neutron dose from a nuclear detonation and also toward eliminating any neutron response in a mixed neutron- gamma field. This was accomplished by various combinations of lithium, paraffin and cadmium shielding. Data indicate that the DT- 60 dosimeter can be modified to approximate more closely doses from specific types of mixed radiations; however, this generally detracts from its value in approximating other types of mixed radiation doses. A paired system of dosimeters, in conjunction with one of the fast neutron dosimetry systems is proposed as being the most satisfactory ar <b>rangement</b> to approximate mixed radiation doses to personnel in the field.

RNDr. Luboš Pick, CSc., DSc., Department of Mathematical Analysis Abstract: The common {{topic of}} this thesis is {{boundedness}} of integral and supre- mal operators between function spaces with weights. The {{results of this}} work have the form of characterizations of validity of weighted operator inequalities for appropriate cones of functions. The outcome {{can be divided into}} three cate- gories according to the particular type of studied operators and function spaces. The first part involves a convolution operator acting on general weighted Lorentz spaces of types Λ, Γ and S defined in terms of the nonincreasing rear- <b>rangement,</b> Hardy-Littlewood maximal function and the difference of these two, respectively. It is characterized when a convolution-type operator with a fixed kernel is bounded between the aforementioned function spaces. Furthermore, weighted Young-type convolution inequalities are obtained and a certain optima- lity property of involved rearrangement-invariant domain spaces is proved. The additional provided information includes a comparison of the results to the pre- viously known ones and an overview of basic properties of some new function spaces [...] ...|$|E

Near the isoelectric point, fully intercalated phases were obtained in solutions of concentration> 0. 5 - 1 M for glycine (Gly), 2 - 3 M for 13 -alanine ({ 3 -Ala), and 12 M for both ",/-aminobutyric acid ('y-Aba) and g-aminovaleric acid (g-Ava). e-aminocaproic acid (e-Aca) with a long chain (C = 6) was only partially intercalated. Intercalated amino acid formed a mono-molecular <b>rangement</b> with the alkyl chain tilting toward the layer at an angle related to H 20 content.

Justification, evaluation and selection of FMSs have now been receiving significant attention in the manufacturing environment. Evaluating alternative FMSs {{in the presence of}} multiple conflicting criteria and performance measures is often a difficult task for the decision maker. Preference ranking tools are special types of multi-criteria decision-making methods in which the decision maker’s preferences on criteria are aggregated together to arrive at the final evaluation and selection of the alternatives. This paper deals with the application of six most potential preference ranking methods for selecting the best FMS for a given manufacturing organization. It is observed that although the performances of these six methods are almost similar, ORESTE (Organization, <b>Rangement</b> Et Synthese De Donnes Relationnelles) method slightly outperforms the others. These methods use some preference function or utility value or Besson ranking of criteria and alternatives, to indicate how much an alternative is preferred to the others. Most of these methods need quantification of criteria weights or different preference parameters, but ORESTE method, being an ordinal outranking approach, only requires ordinal data and attribute rankings according to their importance. Therefore, it is particularly applicable to those situations where the decision maker is unable to provide crisp evaluation data and attribute weights...|$|E

Here, we describe the kinematic and the petrological characteristics of the major shear zones bounding the lowermost continental-derived metamor phic units cropping out in the eastern portion of the Peloritani Mountains. Both meso- and micro-scale shear sense criteria indicate a top-to-the-SSE tectonic transport, during a general evolution from ductile to brittle deformation conditions. Quantitative thermobarometry on texturally equilibrated phengite–chlorite pairs crystallized along the shear bands indicates pressure of 6 – 8 kbar at temperatures of 360 – 440 ◦ C for the structurally highest units and 3 – 4 kbar at 380 – 440 ◦ C for the lowest ones.

40|$|In this study, we analyse the {{evolutionary}} dynamics and phylogenetic implications of gene order rear- <b>rangements</b> in five newly sequenced mitochondrial (mt) genomes and four published mt genomes of isopod crustaceans. The sequence coverage is nearly complete for {{four of the}} five newly sequenced spe- cies, with only the control region and some tRNA genes missing, while in Janira maculosa only two thirds of the genome could be determined. Mitochondrial gene order in isopods seems to be more plastic than that in other crustacean lineages, making all nine known mt gene orders different. Especially the asellote Janira is characterized by many autapomorphies. The following inferred ancestral isopod mt gene order exists slightly modified in modern isopods: nad 1, tnrL 1, rrnS, control region, trnS 1, cob, trnT, nad 5, trnF. We consider the inferred gene translocation events leading to gene rearrangements as valuable charac- ters in phylogenetic analyses. In this first study covering major isopod lineages, potential apomorphies were identified, e. g., a shared relative position of trnR in Valvifera. We also report one of the first findings of homoplasy in mitochondrial gene order, namely a shared relative position of trnV in unrelated isopod lineages.

The transition preference and the significant mutation frequency 34 in the AID motifs (dgyw/wrch and wa/tw) demonstrate a strong dependence of the enzymes mediating 35 SHM in TRG and TRD genes of dromedary similar to that of immunoglobulin genes in mammals. Overall, 36 results reveal no asymmetry in the motifs targeting, i. e. mutations are equally distributed among g:c and 37 a:t base pairs and replacement mutations are favored at the AID motifs, whereas neutral mutations 38 appear to be more prone to accumulate in bases outside of the motifs.

Vanadium oxytrifluoride and hypervalent iodine compounds were compared as oxidants for the conversion of 32 to 33. In an approach directed at a synthesis of pretazettine (17), phenacylamine 57 was elaborated in two steps to oxazole 50. However, this did not undergo catalytic hydrogenation to the desired oxazolidine 47. Oxazoline 60 proved to be too labile to be isolated upon dehydration of 65, which was prepared from di-octopamine (64) and the acid chloride of piperonylic acid (58). Finally, 64 and piperonal (69) were condensed and treated with ethyl chloroformate to provide trans- 2, 5 -diaryloxazolidine 73. However, the latter was hydrolyzed under coupling conditions. Alternatively, when octopamine and piperonal were condensed and hydrogenated, amine 74 was obtained, which was in turn reacted with 1, 1 '-carbonyldiimidazole (75) to furnish the 2 -oxazolidinone 76.

In order to describe a radial jet flow pattern, measurements of radial jet characteristics, such as velocity decay, spreading rate and turbulence intensity profiles across the jet, are needed. An experimental setup has been built up. It allows the measurements to be taken under various geometrical (jet width and orifice diameter) and initial conditions (turbulence intensity, air speed, and temperature at the inlet). The setup consists of an air terminal that creates the radial jet, a ductwork with a fan unit and a heat exchanger. The basic dimensions of the air terminal are 200 mm in diameter and the width of the terminal nozzle is 4 mm; both of them are adjustable. The flow rate can be varied from 50 to 1200 m 3 /h.

These patients have {{a high incidence of}} malignant transformation. No familial case is known and the etiopatho­ genic cause remains unknown. In enchondromatosis (Ollier disease, OD), which is comprised of enchondromas only, 4 mutations in the PTHR 1 gene have been identified in 4 pa­ tients; 3 were somatic and 1 was germline. No PTHR 1 muta­ tions have been detected in MS, whereas somatic IDH 1 and, more rarely, IDH 2 mutations have been observed in 77 % of patients with MS and 81 % of patients with OD. These genetic alterations are shared with other tumors, including glioma, leukemia and carcinoma. To search for underlying somatic genomic causes, we screened MS tissues using Affymetrix SNP-chips. We looked for CNVs, LOH and uniparental isodi­ somy (UPID) by performing pairwise analyses between allelic intensities in tumoral DNA versus the corresponding blood- extracted DNA. While common chromosomal anomalies were absent in constitutional DNA, several shared CNVs were identified in MS-associated tumors. The most frequently encountered somatic alterations were localized in 2 p 22. 3, 2 q 24. 3 and 14 q 11. 2, implicating these chromosomal rear­ <b>rangements</b> in the formation of enchondromas and spindle cell hemangiomas in MS. In one chondrosarcoma specimen, large amplifications and/or deletions were observed in chromosomes 3, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 19. Some of these ge­ netic changes have been reported in other chondrosarcomas suggesting an etiopathogenic role. No LOH/UPID was ob­ served in any Maffucci tissue. Our findings identify frequent somatic chromosomal rearrangements on 2 p 22. 3, 2 q 24. 3 and 14 q 11. 2, which may unmask mutations leading to the lesions pathognomonic of MS...|$|R
40|$|This paper explores {{domestic}} employment {{relations in the}} context of the growth of the post-industrial ser-vice sector and the "stalled revolution. " The data comes from fieldwork conducted among domestic workers, employers, and clients, as well as managers and owners of housecleaning agencies. By presenting a case study of the household service agency "Helping Hands Housekeeping, " I compare and contrast bureaucratized arrange-ments of paid domestic work with the "traditional " private employment arrangement, demonstrating how the bureaucratization of paid domestic work has (and has not) affected the relations, conditions, and experiences of this occupation. To sell their service, managers train workers to "care " for clients. In addition, HHH managers create a work culture of caring and service as a form of worker control and as a strategy to combat worker turn-over. The gender ideologies and personalized management tactics used by these organizations mask the low pay, part-time hours and lack of benefits that persist within the more bureaucratized arrangements of paid domestic work. Workers also implement "strategic personalism " in their relations with employers and clients and may seek out personalistic relationships and use them to their advantage. This research challenges the modernist notion that more formal and structured work relations are sufficient to eliminate the emotional and psychologi-cal exploitation of domestic workers. Indeed, my fieldwork suggests that private employment arrangements offer workers more options and greater potential for negotiating wages and control over the work process than do the more rationalized organizations and relations of household service agencies. In today's society we find a virtual mosaic of {{domestic employment}} ar <b>rangements.</b> Domestic workers, overwhelmingly w o m e n, m a y "live-in " full-time, work daily for one o...|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} {{designed}} to help countries in the INFOFISH region i dentify potential market opportunities for value-added fisheries products, and carry out the pilot production and trial marketing {{of a number of}} selected products. It aimed at pa ving the way for possible future investment, and at strengthening technical cooperation betwe en the seven countries involvedThe project reviewed fisheries products currently offered on the int ernational retail and institutional markets, particularly those usually processed in develo ped countries using raw materials from developing countries. A series of fish species and pro ducts of common interest to a number of the participating countries were selected, and ar <b>rangements</b> made for pilot production by three private companies in Thailand, Indonesia and India. The project supplied the assistance of processing experts for this phaseAt the same time, market studies of the Netherlands, representing th e European market, Japan, and the United States of America were undertaken. Quality requir ements and consumer preferences were investigated; it became particularly clear that packa ging was of vital importance in marketability, and a comprehensive report on the packaging o f the selected products was therefore prepared and distributed by INFOFISH to all participating countriesMarket response and consumer acceptance were tested by participation in an important food trade fair in Cologne, Federal Republic of Germany, in October 19 87. A stand was made available by the German Agency for International Cooperation (GTZ), and the display of the products drew considerable attention. Seventy companies made direct inquiries concerning specific products; there were 150 requests for general inf ormation on the project, and on the availability of value-added products from Asia and the P acific. The three participating companies could have concluded substantial bulk sales if the y had had products available in volumeThe project was extended by a month so that a seminar on the product ion and export of value-added fisheries products might be held in Bangkok between 20 and 22 January 1988. About 70 persons from the participating countries attended, and a panel o f experts provided information on product development, quality control, packaging, process ing and marketing. A visit was arranged to one of the pilot production plantsIt was now recommended that the results of the project be made avail able to the industry through national workshops or seminars, and that governments encour age the private sector to venture into the production of value-added fisheries products. Governments should further identify product and market opportunities; it was recommended th at INFOFISH give attention to trade promotion activities and advise member governme nt institutions on this subject. It was also recommended that an exchange of infor mation between INFOFISH member countries on product development and market opportunitie s be promoted, through a programme of industrial seminars under the aegis of INFOFIS...|$|R
40|$|Cities in deltas are {{vulnerable}} to climate change, especially their unembanked neighborhoods that are not protected by dikes. Rising sea levels and extreme water levels in the rivers {{can lead to the}} flooding of these urban areas. The Nether- lands has a long history in water management. However, building dikes and the elevation of land are traditionally treated as rather stand-alone measures. Attention is rarely paid to the surrounding area, let alone to the complex context of cities and certainly not to disadvantaged neighborhoods. Yet, inner-city area redevelopment may provide opportuni- ties to integrate flood management in these planning processes. In order to investigate the support of stakeholders for risk-reducing adaptive measures and more resilient measures, we did research in an unembanked inner-city area in the city of Rotterdam (The Netherlands), in which we conducted in-depth interviews with the central stakeholders. The main conclusion is that the most important barriers for integrating climate adaptation measures into that neighborhood are the fragmentation of water-safety policy (e. g. elevation of rebuilding locations) and the hierarchical governance ar- <b>rangement</b> in water management. This type of fragmentation led on its turn to fragmentation with other policy goals for the neighborhood. It also led to fragmentation between different areas in the same neighborhood that received political attention and those that are excluded from water-safety policy. This questions the approach in terms of social justice. An important side effect is that this governance arrangement also restricted innovation towards climate adaptation. Therefore, integrating water-safety policies in urban planning (in its capacity as a more integrative and comprehensive spatial approach) should be considered the best option to increase the adaptive capacity in delta cities. Not only can the negative effects in terms of policy fragmentation be dealt with effectively, but also spatial fragmentation can be tackled...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{movements}} {{resulting from}} solifluction or similar processes {{have been investigated}} at Schefferville, P. Q., Canada, where the variation of movement with depth below the surface was specially considered. Tubes up to 2 m long were inserted vertically {{in the ground and}} their subsequent deformation (if any) measured withspecial probes, which passed down the tubes in situ. Some sites proved to be entirely stable despite vegetational characteristics that might have been related to disturbance. Movements at the surface ofmore than 10 cm/yr. were recorded on a 20 " bare slope covered with small stones. Similar large movements were recorded on a lobate terrace-like feature with a general 8 to l 00 slope. The distribution ofmovement with depth was such as to produce a typically concave downslope form in the tubes. The movements varied in intensity and from year to year; they decreased with depth, and were not measurable below about 1 m. Although they are similar to those observed by Rapp and others, they are remarkable in view of the slight slope on which they occurred. Analysis shows that consolidation following frost heave isprobably not the sole cause. A stability calculation of the type commonly used for engineering purposes would have given no indication of the occurrence of movements of the magnitude observed. They mighthave been suspected, however, from geomorphological considerations of the origin of the surface features of the affected area.

40|$|Catalysis {{of metal}} carbene transformations with {{selected}} dirhodium(II) catalysts {{is a useful}} technology for constructing complex polycycles via intramolecular cyclopropanation, C-H insertion, and ylide derived reactions of diazoacetates and diazoacetoacetates. In this thesis, novel methodologies based upon intramolecular C-H insertion and the oxonium ylides rearrangements are investigated, and {{a new understanding of}} oxonium ylide formation and rearrangements is presented. In chapter 1, in work done under the supervision of Dr. Herman O. Sintim, a novel methodology for the synthesis of enantiopure tertiary alcohols is described. The key step in the methodology is an intramolecular C-H insertion reaction whereby a new connector between a carbene center and the C-H target, the N-O tether, is introduced. The resulting C-H insertion products were converted to tertiary-amino alcohols via cleavage of the N-O tether. This approach allows the regioselective insertion of metal carbenes into the C-H bond alpha to a heteroatom and leads to the formation of tertiary stereocenters. Key concepts are outlined that aim at achieving selectivity in C-H insertion using a new tether that facilitates the construction of five membered rings, thus enabling remote functionalization of complex molecules. In chapter 2, a detailed analysis of the mechanism of oxonium ylide generation and rearrangement, which has not been previously reported, was performed to gain insight into the mechanistic pathway by which oxonium ylides rearrange. The mechanism was studied via the synthesis of oxabicyclo[4. 2. 1]nonane compounds. Catalytic ylide formation and subsequent [1, 2]-Stevens rearrangement unexpectedly resulted in a 70 : 30 molar ratio of two diastereoisomers formed in high yield. There was negligible dependence of the ratio of the two diastereoisomers on either para substituents on the aromatic ring or on the catalyst employed. However, the use of a large aryl substituent (e. g., anthranyl, mesityl, and 2, 6 -dimethyl- 4 -nitrophenyl) resulted in the formation of a single diastereoisomer. The importance {{of the size of the}} aryl group, coupled with the absence of a substituent effect on the ratio of the [1, 2]-Stevens rearrangement diastereoisomers suggest that conformational influences are responsible for the apparent isomerization. Each diazoacetoacetate conformer forms a different oxonium ylide and subsequent rear <b>rangement</b> of each of these oxonium ylides leads to the formation of a distinct diastereoisomeric product. In chapter 3, the mechanism of oxonium ylides rearranging via the [2, 3]- sigmatropic rearrangement pathway was also investigated. Rh(II) catalyzed oxonium ylide generation of trans- 3 -styryltetrahydropyranone- 5 -diazoacetoacetates and its subsequent rearrangement forms two diastereoisomers in both the [1, 2]-Stevens and [2, 3]-sigmatropic processes. The two diastereoisomers of the [2, 3]-sigmatropic processes, (78 : 22) molar ratio, are formed in high yield, but with negligible dependence on either para substituents on the aromatic ring or on the catalyst employed. The formation of a second diastereoisomer for the symmetry-allowed concerted [2, 3]-sigmatropic rearrangement process is supportive of a concerted mechanism leading to the two diastereoisomers of the [2, 3]-sigmatropic processes via the presence of two conformational isomers of trans- 3 -styryltetrahydropyranone- 5 diazoacetoacetates...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{special issue}} of the Electronic Journal of Digital Enterprise (e-JDE), on Concepts and Tools for Knowledge Management (KM), {{develops}} {{the argument that the}} governance of knowledge seems to be the Scientific Policy able to creating value with regard of human and its evolution in cultures and civilizations. The duty of good governance is a consideration of the transfer of knowledge related to scientific and technological progress. Intrinsically, this process requires a system of organization and knowledge management by implementing knowledge production and its influence in society. The objective of the ISKO-Maghreb Chapter is to contribute in understanding the factors that organize knowledge and phenomena that affect the information society. Actions to be undertaken by the scientific ISKO society must take into account socio-cultural, cognitive and economic in the strategic management of knowledge. Towards the knowledge society, it should be seen in its dynamic, its content and its interaction with science and technology associated to universities, companies and politics. In this context, a first orientation is pedagogical attempt to answer the question "what is known about the knowledge and its organization?". Then the issue is moving towards the societal issues of knowledge, theory and practice, to provide clarification to a convergence of KM (Knowledge Management) approaches. Education, science, culture, communication and technology remain the major themes covered by ISKO-Maghreb, {{for the development of the}} knowledge organization, expertise management and collective intelligence.

40|$|The MEG experiment, {{located at}} the Paul Scherrer Institut near Zurich (Switzerland), {{searches}} for the lepton flavour violating decay μ+ → e+ + γ (1) The MEG collaboration has recently published a new upper limit on the branching ratio BR(μ+ → e+ + γ) < 5. 7 · 10 − 13 (90 % C. L.) The Standard Model does not predict violation of the flavour of charged-leptons, that means the decay (1) is forbidden by this theory, unless the recently discovered neu- trino oscillations are incorporated in the Standard Model: in this case, an experimentally unattainable branching ratio ∼ 10 − 55 is expected. Some Super-Symmetric extensions to the Standard Model predict the decay (1) in the range 10 − 11 − 10 − 14, making the search worthwhile with a new upgraded apparatus. The MEG II experiment aims to reach a ten times lower limit on the branching ratio BR(μ+ → e+ + γ) < 6. 0 · 10 − 14 in 3 years of data taking; studies on the upgrade have already started and will continue until 2015, then a first test run {{is expected to be}} done at the end of 2015. In order to achieve this result, an improvement of the detectors resolutions is mandatory: the two main detectors involved in the upgrade process are the magnetic spectrometer and the LXe calorimeter which, respectively, measure momentum and emission point of the positron and the photon energy, as well as the position of the photon conversion. The new improved drift chamber is designed with more than a thousand wires in a stereo configuration, immersed in a helium-isobutane gas mixture as active medium. The cham- ber allows for a 3 -dimensional reconstruction of the positron trajectory. An increase by a factor 3 of the MEG muon-stopping rate is also foreseen in the MEG II upgrade, but it will affect the drift chamber performances during the detector operation. Fragmentation of the gas molecules in the avalanches causes formation of deposits along the wires, with a reduction of the gas gain or, in the extreme case, continous discharge of the chamber: this phenomenon is called ‘ageing’. The collected charge density on wires is of the order of a few tenth of Coulombs per centimetre during the whole experiment life- time, so a study of how much the chamber performances change due to ageing is crucial. This thesis analyzes different aspects that {{must be taken into account}} in the construction of the final MEG II drift chamber, through realization and characterization of several different prototypes at the Pisa INFN laboratories. The ageing effects have been studied in a series of prototypes, based on a single drift cell configuration, some of them built using a preliminary set of wires and one with the final chamber wires; also the insertion of contaminant material inside the gas volume has been studied. Inspections of the aged wires with the SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) are presentedalong with an EDX (Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) analysis. The main feature of a drift chamber is the capability of tracking a charged particle po- sition by using drift time information, which is the time between the positron crossing and the avalanche formation on the anode wire: a basic configuration of three-cell ar- <b>rangement</b> has been simulated through Monte Carlo techniques, then built and tested on a prototype. Starting from three anode signals, a simple algorithm provides the track parameters of a charged ionizing particle passing through the detector volume and the single-hit resolution, defined as the uncertainty on the three impact parameters, is esti- mated to be ∼ 100 μm. In a stereo wires disposition, a drift cell mantains its shape but the transverse size changes, in addition it is twisted along the z−axis direction: if the longitudinal cell extension is ∼ 2 m, the cell transverse size variation is non-negligible and gain variations effects arise. Gain variations are studied in a 180 cm long single-cell prototype, built with the prelim- inary set of wires: the experimental results are compared to Monte Carlo simulations. Results obtained with these prototypes have been already implemented in the MEG II drift chamber design: when the detector will be operative, they can be a valuable start- ing point in achieving optimal features, both in terms of experimental resolutions and functional stability...|$|E
