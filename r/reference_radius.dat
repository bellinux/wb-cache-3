40|$|The {{computation}} {{of transmission}} spectra {{is a central}} ingredient {{in the study of}} exoplanetary atmospheres. First, we revisit the theory of transmission spectra, unifying ideas from several workers in the literature. Transmission spectra lack an absolute normalization due to the a priori unknown value of a <b>reference</b> transit <b>radius,</b> which is tied to an unknown reference pressure. We show that there is a degeneracy between the uncertainty in the transit radius, the assumed value of the reference pressure (typically set to 10 bar) and the inferred value of the water abundance when interpreting a WFC 3 transmission spectrum. Second, we show that the transmission spectra of isothermal atmospheres are nearly isobaric. We validate the isothermal, isobaric analytical formula for the transmission spectrum against full numerical calculations and show that the typical errors are ~ 0. 1 % (~ 10 ppm) within the WFC 3 range of wavelengths for temperatures of 1500 K (or higher). Third, we generalize the previous expression for the transit radius to include a small temperature gradient. Finally, we analyze the measured WFC 3 transmission spectrum of WASP- 12 b and demonstrate that we obtain consistent results with the retrieval approach of Kreidberg et al. (2015) if the <b>reference</b> transit <b>radius</b> and <b>reference</b> pressure are fixed to assumed values. The unknown functional relationship between the <b>reference</b> transit <b>radius</b> and <b>reference</b> pressure implies that it is the product of the water abundance and reference pressure that is being retrieved from the data, and not just the water abundance alone. This degeneracy leads to a limitation on how accurately we may extract molecular abundances from transmission spectra using WFC 3 data alone. Finally, we compare our study to that of Griffith (2014) and discuss why the degeneracy was missed in previous retrieval studies.

40|$|Among modern {{fatigue design}} {{concepts}} for welded structures, the linear-elastic notch stress concept gains increasing industrial acceptance.

The concept with rref = 1. 00 mm is based on the micro-support theory of Neuber with the fictitious radius rref = 1. 00 mm, derived by Radaj. The background of the concept with rref = 0. 05 mm is the relationship between the stress-intensity factor and the notch stress according to Creager and Paris as well as Irvin's theory of crack blunting. Besides these two theories, the definition of both of these radii has also an experimental b ackground; they are observed in many welded joints. In the present paper, first the background and then different applications of both concept variants are described: the application of the <b>reference</b> <b>radius</b> of rref = 1. 00 mm for MAG-welded offshore K-nodes (t = 30 mm) and sandwich panels for ship decks (t = 5 mm), and the application of rref = 0. 05 mm for spot-welded automotive doors (t = 1 mm) and MAG-welded automotive trailing links (t = 3 - 4 mm).

40|$|We study {{turbulent}} channel {{flows of}} monodisperse and polydisperse suspensions of finite-size spheres {{by means of}} Direct Numerical Simulations using an immersed boundary method {{to account for the}} dispersed phase. Suspensions with 3 different Gaussian distributions of particle radii are considered (i. e. 3 different standard deviations). The distributions are centered on the <b>reference</b> particle <b>radius</b> of the monodisperse suspension. In the most extreme case, the radius of the largest particles is 4 times that of the smaller particles. We consider two different solid volume fractions, 2 % and 10 %. We find that for all polydisperse cases, both fluid and particles statistics are not substantially altered with respect to those of the monodisperse case. Mean streamwise fluid and particle velocity profiles are almost perfectly overlapping. Slightly larger differences are found for particle velocity fluctuations. These increase close to the wall and decrease towards the centerline as the standard deviation of the distribution is increased. Hence, the behavior of the suspension is mostly governed by excluded volume effects regardless of particle size distribution (at least for the radii here studied). Due to turbulent mixing, particles are uniformly distributed across the channel. However, smaller particles can penetrate more into the viscous and buffer layer and velocity fluctuations are therein altered. Non trivial results are presented for particle-pair statistics.

The elementary scatterers at visible wavelengths are found to be sub-micronic, but the inferred size distribution underestimates the number of large grains, resulting in sub-millimeter emissions that are too low compared to the observations. From our inversion procedure, we find that the V- to H-band scattering cross sections ratio increases outside 40 AU, in line with the observed color gradient of the disk. This behavior is expected if the grains have not been produced locally, but placed in orbits of high eccentricity by a size-dependent pressure force, resulting in a paucity of large grains beyond {{the outer edge of the}} parent bodies' disk. Because of the low luminosity of AU Mic, radiation pressure is inefficient to diffuse the smallest grains in the outer disk, even when the flares are taken into account. Conversely, we show that a standard, solar-like stellar wind generates a pressure force onto the dust particles that behaves much like a radiation pressure force. With an assumed dot{M} ≃ 3 × 102 dot{M}ȯ, the wind pressure overcomes the radiation pressure, and this effect is enhanced by the stellar flares. This greatly contributes to populating the extended AU Mic debris disk and explains the similarity between the β Pictoris and AU Mic brightness profiles.
