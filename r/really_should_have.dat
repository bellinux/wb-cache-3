[...] Androzani.com said of the episode, [...] "It's awful. It's horrific. It seriously, seriously sucks," [...] adding [...] "the single nice thing we can find to say is that the concept had potential." [...] Seb Patrick of Noise to Signal thought, [...] "despite a strong - and {{somewhat}} morally ambiguous - ending [...] <b>really</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> delivered in more spectacular fashion than this." [...] Patrick also criticised Jack's personality throughout the episode, stating [...] "we wanted a spinoff series about him because he was cocky, cool and downright entertaining - Buzz Lightyear meets Ace Rimmer meets James Bond. We didn't want some grumpy immortal bastard with a chip on his shoulder." [...] Despite the mixed reviews however, the series producers and BBC controller of fiction Jane Tranter regard the episode as one of their favourites from the first series.|$|E
500|$|Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine complimented the remix stating: [...] " [...] might replace André 3000's {{typically}} great guest feature {{with one}} from J. Cole, but hey, anyone can sound good over this beat. And not only that, but Cole's vocals, however brief, are a welcome complement." [...] Making reference to its music video, Entertainment Weeklys Erin Strecker commented: [...] "I'm assuming it was shot mid-summer, {{which is when}} this <b>really</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been put out. Releasing this track {{at the end of}} October seems like an odd choice, as the video involves a grillout and trailer-park pool party that would have sparkled mid-July." [...] The remix was nominated in the category for Best Collaboration at the 2012 BET Awards. For the week ending November 5, 2011, [...] "Party" [...] debuted at number two on the South Korean International Singles Chart, selling 85,143 digital downloads. It became the seventy third best-selling single in South Korea in 2011.|$|E

Morrison, as usual, declined {{to take part}} but the author's scholarly methods lend this weighty volume a real authority." [...] The Journal Gazette called the book: [...] "A definitive, provocative and revelatory portrait of an endlessly complicated man and his music." [...] A review in The Irish Times characterised the book as a [...] "magical" [...] journey into Van Morrison's life, noting: [...] "Johnny Rogan spent 23 years researching his biography of Van Morrison. It shows. In a book that <b>really</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been titled Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Van Morrison But Were Too Petrified To Ask, this is a magical 'into the mystic' journey which vertiginously takes you from Edward Carson to Leadbelly, from the Mafia to the Rosacrucians, from drinking stories to Gestalt therapy, and from Bernadette Devlin to Terry Keane." [...] Brian Boyd of The Irish Times described Rogan's work as a [...] "superb book".|$|E

2500|$|Anime News Network's Carl Kimlinger {{finds the}} series [...] "shiny, attractive, and—on the whole—entertaining". But {{he adds that}} [...] "given the premise (and skill of the writers) it <b>really</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> shot for pulpy thrills instead of stately {{political}} intrigue." [...] Theron Martin says [...] "for the series as a whole to be worth watching, though, the storytelling and character development need to improve". Melissa Harper adds it is a [...] "slick, well animated show" [...] but [...] "disjointed story {{makes it difficult to}} know or care what is going on".

2500|$|Eurogamer's Ronan Jennings {{scored the}} Xbox version 7 out of 10, writing [...] "in terms of progression, {{the only real}} {{difference}} between this and Dark Alliance {{is that the first}} game felt like it had better structure to it. In fact, DAII feels more like an expansion pack in that regard, with players sometimes given the option to complete quests in any order they choose [...] It's hard not to be disappointed in Dark Alliance II. However, it's equally hard to criticise such a polished effort. On the one hand, it offers more of the great hack and slash gameplay that no one has emulated properly since the first Dark Alliance. On the other hand, the magic of the original has definitely been diluted, where it <b>really</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> been enhanced." ...|$|E

Brilliant!' And of course I was really chuffed, too, because he'd actually rung {{me to talk}} about it and ask me if I had any songs that might fit that sort of theme. I was like, 'Well, no, but give me a minute and I'll see what I can do.'" [...] Speaking about the record in later years, however, Dickinson remarked that [...] "we almost did [...] ", explaining that, [...] "it was only half a concept album.

[...] A shop-girl laughed with her. She stole {{into one of the}} elevators, and, though she <b>really</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> gone home to her mother, she went into the music department, where, among lattices wreathed with newly dusted roses, she listened to waltzes and two-steps played by a red-haired girl who was chewing gum and talking to a man while she played.

60|$|Sometimes I {{thought of}} telling Mr. Jarndyce. Then I {{feared that the}} young man would lose his {{situation}} and that I might ruin him. Sometimes I thought of confiding in Richard, but was deterred by the possibility of his fighting Mr. Guppy and giving him black eyes. Sometimes I thought, should I frown at him or shake my head. Then I felt I could not do it. Sometimes I considered whether I should write to his mother, but that ended in my being convinced that to open a correspondence would be to make the matter worse. I always came to the conclusion, finally, that I could do nothing. Mr. Guppy's perseverance, all this time, not only produced him regularly at any theatre to which we went, but caused him to appear in the crowd as we were coming out, and even to get up behind our fly--where I am sure I saw him, two or three times, struggling among the most dreadful spikes. After we got home, he haunted a post opposite our house. The upholsterer's where we lodged being at the corner of two streets, and my bedroom window being opposite the post, I was afraid to go near the window when I went upstairs, lest I should see him (as I did one moonlight night) leaning against the post and evidently catching cold.

6000|$|But I am {{far from}} pretending that these desperations of {{ingenuity}} have not--as through seeming {{most of the}} very essence of the problem--their exasperated charm; so far from it that my particular supreme predicament in the Paris hotel, after an undue primary leakage of time, no doubt, over at the great river-spanning museum of the Champ de Mars and the Trocadero, fairly takes on to me now the tender grace of a day that is dead. Re-reading the last chapters of The Tragic Muse I catch again the very odour of Paris, which comes up in the rich rumble of the Rue de la Paix--with which my room itself, for that matter, seems impregnated--and which hangs for reminiscence about the embarrassed effort to [...] "finish," [...] not ignobly, within my already exceeded limits; an effort prolonged each day to those late afternoon hours during which the tone of the terrible city seemed to deepen about one to an effect strangely composed at once of the auspicious and the fatal. The [...] "plot" [...] of Paris thickened at such hours beyond any other plot in the world, I think; but there one sat meanwhile with another, on one's hands, absolutely requiring precedence. Not the least imperative of one's conditions was thus that one should have <b>really,</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> finely and (given one's scale) concisely treated one's subject, in spite of there being so much of the confounded irreducible quantity still to treat. If I spoke just now, however, of the [...] "exasperated" [...] charm of supreme difficulty, that is because the challenge of economic representation so easily becomes, in any of the arts, intensely interesting to meet. To put all that is possible of one's idea into a form and compass that will contain and express it only by delicate adjustments and an exquisite chemistry, so that there will at the end be neither a drop of one's liquor left nor a hair's breadth of the rim of one's glass to spare--every artist will remember how often that sort of necessity has carried with it its particular inspiration. Therein lies the secret of the appeal, to his mind, of the successfully foreshortened thing, where representation is arrived at, as I have already elsewhere had occasion to urge, not by the addition of items (a light that has for its attendant shadow a possible dryness) but by the art of figuring synthetically, a compactness into which the imagination may cut thick, as into the rich density of wedding-cake. The moral of all which indeed, I fear, is, perhaps too trivially, but that the [...] "thick," [...] the false, the dissembling second half of the work before me, associated throughout with the effort to weight my dramatic values as heavily as might be, since they had to be so few, presents that effort as at the very last a quite convulsive, yet in its way highly agreeable, spasm. Of such mild prodigies is the [...] "history" [...] of any specific creative effort composed! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My dearest Father,--I {{have not}} before {{told you that}} I have been at work for just three weeks upon a new subject; reading, however, Hebrew every day almost for three hours as well. Schier {{is not a great}} Hebraist; and I found the {{language}} in one sense easier than I expected, so that with good grammar and dictionary I can quite get on by myself, reading an easy part of the Bible (historical books, e.g.} at the rate of about twenty-five verses an hour. Well, I began to think that I ought to use the opportunities that Dresden affords. I know that Hebrew is not a rich language; that many words occur only once, and consequently have an arbitrary meaning attached to them, unless they can be illustrated from cognate languages. Now I have a taste for these things, and have in three weeks progressed so far in my new study as to feel sure I shall make it useful; and so I tell you without fear I am working at Arabic. I hope you won't think it silly. It is very hard, and for ten days was as hard work as I ever had in my life. I think I have learnt enough to see my way now, and this morning read the first chapter of Genesis in three-quarters of an hour. It is rich, beyond all comparison, in inflexions; and the difficulty arises from the extreme multiplicity of all its forms: e.g. each verb having not only active, middle, and passive voices, but the primitive active having not less than thirty-five derivative forms and the passive thirteen. The [...] "noun of action,"--infinitive with article (to akonein) of the Greek--is again different for each voice or form; and the primitive can take any of twenty-two forms, which are not compounded according to any rule. Again, there are twenty-eight sets of irregular plurals, which are quite arbitrary. No grammarian has ever given any explanation about them. All mere matters of memory. The very alphabet shows the richness of the language. There are twenty-nine letters, besides vowel points; and each letter is written in four different ways, so that it is different when isolated, when in the beginning, middle, or end of a word. It took me some hours to learn them. In very many respects, it is closely allied to the Hebrew, so that everybody who writes Hebrew grammars and lexicons necessarily {{has much to do with}} Arabic; and a knowledge of it may be of great use in clearing up difficulties in the Bible. My year in Oxford will enable me to go on with it, for in three weeks more I hope to be able to go on alone. To-morrow I begin the Koran. My lessons will not in all exceed 31; and I <b>really</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> gone on, perhaps, not much faster with Hebrew if I had worked it exclusively; and it is hard to read so many hours at one thing: and I may say, now without doubt, that I have laid the foundation for a study of Oriental languages, if I have time and opportunity that may be fairly given to them. Think what one hour a day is, and the pleasure to me is very great, and I feel that I have a knack rather (if I may say so) of laying hold of these things. Don't mention it to anyone.' ...|$|E
6000|$|MY DEAR JAMES PAYN, - I am {{asked to}} relate to you a little {{incident}} of domestic life at Vailima. I had read your GLEAMS OF MEMORY, No. 1; it then went to my wife, to Osbourne, to the cousin that is within my gates, and to my respected amanuensis, Mrs. Strong. [...] Sunday approached. In {{the course of the}} afternoon I was attracted to the great 'all - the winders is by Vanderputty, which upon entering I beheld a memorable scene. The floor was bestrewn with the forms of midshipmen from the CURACOA - 'boldly say a wilderness of gunroom' - {{and in the midst of}} this sat Mrs. Strong throned on the sofa and reading aloud GLEAMS OF MEMORY. They had just come the length of your immortal definition of boyhood in the concrete, and I had the pleasure to see the whole party dissolve under its influence with inextinguishable laughter. I thought this was not half bad for arthritic gout! Depend upon it, sir, when I go into the arthritic gout business, I shall be done with literature, or at least with the funny business. It is quite true I have my battlefields behind me. I have done perhaps as much work as anybody else under the most deplorable conditions. But two things fall to be noticed: In the first place, I never was in actual pain; and in the second, I was never funny. I'll tell you the worst day that I remember. I had a haemorrhage, and was not allowed to speak; then, induced by the devil, or an errant doctor, I was led to partake of that bowl which neither cheers nor inebriates - the castor-oil bowl. Now, when castor-oil goes right, it is one thing; but when it goes wrong, it is another. And it went WRONG with me that day. The waves of faintness and nausea succeeded each other for twelve hours, and I do feel a legitimate pride in thinking that I stuck to my work all through and wrote a good deal of Admiral Guinea (which I might just as well not have written for all the reward it ever brought me) in spite of the barbarous bad conditions. I think that is my great boast; and it seems a little thing alongside of your GLEAMS OF MEMORY illustrated by spasms of arthritic gout. We <b>really</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> an order of merit in the trade of letters. For valour, Scott would have had it; Pope too; myself on the strength of that castor-oil; and James Payn would be a Knight Commander. The worst of it is, though Lang tells me you exhibit the courage of Huish, that not even an order can alleviate the wretched annoyance of the business. I have always said that there is nothing like pain; toothache, dumb-ague, arthritic gout, it does not matter what you call it, if the screw is put upon the nerves sufficiently strong, there is nothing left in heaven or in earth that can interest the sufferer. Still, even to this there is the consolation that it cannot last for ever. [...] Either you will be relieved and have a good hour again before the sun goes down, or else you will be liberated. It is something after all (although not much) to think that you are leaving a brave example; that other literary men love to remember, as I am sure they will love to remember, everything about you - your sweetness, your brightness, your helpfulness to all of us, and in particular those one or two really adequate and noble papers which you have been privileged to write during these last years. - With the heartiest and kindest good-will, I remain, yours ever, ...|$|E
