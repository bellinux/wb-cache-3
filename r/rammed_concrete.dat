40|$|Before the Second World War, {{building}} details {{made from}} <b>rammed</b> <b>concrete</b> with precise shape and surface like sandstone had been {{widely used in}} large regions. They were used as basic decorative materials in the buildings of style Art Nouveau from Scandinavia to the Black Sea. A production technique to manufacture architectural details from <b>rammed</b> <b>concrete</b> was traditional in northern countries, although, forgotten nowadays. This production method was renewed by “Pamats” Ltd in 1991. The <b>rammed</b> <b>concrete</b> details are invaluable material for restoration works and architecture, particularly in the regions of style Art Nouveau (Figure 1, 2). Such material with high surface quality is being used for restoration, in modern interiors, in garden architecture, etc. Deterioration and corrosion of <b>rammed</b> <b>concrete</b> surface are influenced by water migration during exposition in the atmosphere. Manual work and low quality of raw materials are reasons for creating cracks, discrepancies of the structure and surface, appearance of light patches of crystalline salts on the surface, and other defects. Investigations of microstructure, chemical microanalysis, pore size distribution and physical properties of standard samples, natural and artificial weathered samples were carried out. The porosity and major pore sizes of weathered concrete are larger than ones of standard sample. Light patches of crystalline salts in the structure and {{on the surface of}} weathered concrete were observed. According to the chemical analysis, light crystalline is water-soluble compound containing Ca ions. Ions of these compounds shift from structure to surface of concrete together with water. The commercial additives and fly ash were used to increase the durability and surface quality of <b>rammed</b> <b>concrete</b> details. According to the data of investigation, commercial additive of Microsilica was defined as the most perspective additive for limiting corrosion and migration of Ca ions to concrete surface...|$|E
50|$|Al-Shabaab militants {{launch a}} {{surprise}} attack on Villa Somalia, {{when a car}} loaded with heavy explosives <b>rams</b> into the <b>concrete</b> barrier surrounding {{the perimeter of the}} palace. A group of nine armed men penetrate the area where the first bomb hit. All of the attackers are carrying suicide vests and fight a lengthy gun-battle with presidential guards inside the compound. The assault ends when Somali government troops and AMISOM forces reinforce the presidential guards in retaking several key buildings. President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud is unharmed. Government casualties are estimated at five palace guards killed, including the deputy intelligence chief Mohamed Nur Shirbow and Mohamed Abdulle, a close aide to the prime minister. All nine of the attackers were later found and confirmed dead.|$|R
40|$|Using in-situ soils for {{building}} constructions is attractive in the sustainable development because these materials have low embodied energy and present an interesting hygro-thermal behavior. Several researches have been recently {{carried out to}} study soil materials. However, the variability of soil characteristics on each construction site makes {{that the use of}} an unique construction technique (soil <b>concrete,</b> <b>rammed</b> earth, adobe, …) becomes difficult to satisfy several exigencies of the modern regulations (mechanical, thermal performances, durability and earthquake resistance), and the economic criterion. This paper introduces firstly a strategy which can facilitate the use of in-situ soils {{for building}} constructions. Relevant techniques corresponding to several in-situ soil types are proposed. Then, the application of the proposed approach is showed with a case study on a building project using a soil concrete. Several aspects are investigated: material optimization, architectural design, structural-thermal performances and life cycle analysis...|$|R
40|$|In recent time piled {{foundations}} are extensively applied {{due to an}} increase of storeys in buildings constructed in Minsk and load increment on the soil. Preference is given to this approach even in the case when relatively firm soil occurs in the top part of the foundation bed. In this case maximum usage of the foundation bed bearing capacity and reduction of foundation cost are considered as top-priority tasks for designers. One {{of the ways to}} increase the bearing capacity of {{piled foundations}} is the necessity to take into account resistance of foundation bed soil located under raft bottom. The raft as well as a shallow foundation is capable to transfer a significant part of building load into the soil. Such approach makes it possible to reduce a number of piles in the foundation or shorten their length. Then it results in shortening of the construction period and significant reduction in zero cycle. However up to the present moment reliable calculation methods that permit to take into account soil resistance in the raft base. An analysis of previous investigations on the matter executed by various researchers and a number of field investigations have been carried out with the purpose to develop the proposed methods. The paper presents results of field investigations on foundations consisting of short stamped tapered piles which are joined together {{with the help of the}} raft fragment. Strength and deformation characteristics of the bases are increasing while making such foundations in the fill-up soil. In this case the filled-up ground layer becomes a bearing layer both for piles and rafts as well. Improvement of high-plastic clay-bearing soil properties is ensured by <b>ramming</b> dry <b>concrete</b> mix under pile foot. The paper describes an experience on application of the piled-raft foundation in complicated engineering and geological conditions while constructing the Orthodox Church in Minsk. </p...|$|R
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} the city of Huamachuco, a town 3200 meters above sea level in Northern Peru. The main {{aim of this study}} is to share and {{disseminate}} technological knowledge on architecture, building technology and lifestyle of Huamachuco inhabitants. The paper objective is to (1) highlight the concept of architectural quality in Huamachuco, (2) compare the living environment of existing traditional dwellings in comparison with newly constructed concrete dwellings, and to (3) identify the reasons for neglecting ecological construction technologies and materials in the new built environment. The research methodology went through different phases that range from qualitative data collection and quantitative measuring, to data analysis and findings reporting. Firstly, a typological study was conducted visiting 110 houses. The typological study enabled us to describe and understand the housing typologies and classify those under four major typologies according to their construction techniques: 1) adobe, 2) <b>rammed</b> earth, 3) <b>concrete</b> and 4) mixed technique. Secondly, detailed field studies were conducted for representative houses representing the four categories. Finally, 10 houses have been thoroughly audited for using measuring equipment to collect data related to temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, lighting intensity, and envelope thermography.

40|$|Sri Lanka can be {{affected}} by a multitude of natural disasters such as cyclones, minor earthquakes, Tsunami, floods and landslides. Although it is relatively easier to avoid the sites prone to floods and landslides, the built environments must have sufficient robustness against cyclones and earthquakes. For houses constructed close to the coast, there is some risk of at least partial submergence in a tsunami since {{it is difficult to}} predict the distance of travel of waves inland. Therefore, partial or complete damage to houses is of common occurrence in a natural disaster as evident from cyclone of 1978 or tsunami of 2004. When a rebuilding exercise is undertaken immediately after a natural disaster for resettlement of displaced families, a severe burden is placed in the supplies of building materials. Since majority of building materials used for houses have natural resources as the origin, certain adverse environmental impacts also could occur especially with over exploitation. Some examples are the recent sand crisis and environmental damage experienced due to excessive clay mining. Therefore, paying sufficient attention to sustainable construction will be of extreme importance during the disaster recovery phase. This paper critically evaluates the various alternative materials {{that could be used for}} minimizing the environmental impacts while improving the sustainability. Real examples are drawn from the tsunami reconstruction activities carried out in various parts of Sri Lanka where alternative materials such as Compressed Stabilized Earth bricks and blocks, <b>rammed</b> earth, chip <b>concrete</b> blocks and micro concrete tiles have been used...|$|R
