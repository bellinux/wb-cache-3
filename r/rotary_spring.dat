On the basis of literature, different transformations have been used in the model to achieve simpler calculation. The numerical simulation is used to solve a non-stationary case of a gasfilm. The simulation results were compared with literature results in a stationary case (steady running conditions) and they were found to be equal. In addition to this, comparisons were made with a number of stationary and non-stationary bearing tests, which were performed at Lappeenranta University of Technology using bearings designed with the simulation program. A study was also made using numerical simulation and literature to establish the influence of the different bearing parameters on the stability of the bearing. Comparison work was done with literature on tilting pad gas bearings. This bearing type is rarely used. One literature reference has studied the same bearing type as that used in LUT. A new design of tilting pad gas bearing is introduced. It is based on a stainless steel body and electron beam welding of the bearing parts. It has good operation characteristics and is easier to tune and faster to manufacture than traditional constructions. It is also suitable for large serial production...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{addresses}} {{the mechanics of}} a cracked cantilever beam subjected to a transverse force applied at it's free end. In this Part A of a two Part series of papers, {{emphasis is placed on}} the development of a four-beam model for a beam with a fully embedded horizontal sharp crack. The beam aspect ratio, crack length and crack centre location appear as general model parameters. <b>Rotary</b> <b>springs</b> are introduced at the crack tip cross sections as needed to account for the changes in the structural compliance due to the presence of the sharp crack and augmented load transfer through the near-tip transition regions. Guided by recent finite element findings reported elsewhere, the four-beam model is advanced by recognizing two key observations, (a) the free surface and neutral axis curvatures of the cracked beam at the crack center location match the curvature of a healthy beam (an identical beam without a crack under the same loading conditions), (b) the neutral axis rotations (slope) of the cracked beam in the region between the applied load and the nearest crack tip matches the corresponding slope of the healthy beam. The above observations {{led to the development of}} close form solutions for the resultant forces (axial and shear) and moment acting in the beams above and below the crack. Axial force and bending moment predictions are found to be in excellent agreement with 2 D finite element results for all normalized crack depths considered. Shear force estimates dominating the beams above and below the crack as well as transition region length estimates are also obtained. The model developed in this study is then used along with 2 D finite elements in conducting parametric studies aimed at both validating the model and establishing the mechanics of the cracked system under consideration. The latter studies are reported in the companion paper Part B-Results and Discussion. Introduction. Over the last two decades, the frequency response [1 - 5] of a component or a structure has been used to assess " structural health " as one of several methods used in damage detection [6 - 13] and structural health monitoring. In most of such studies, the effects of damage on the structural frequency response has been explored using a cantilever beam geometry. With the above in mind, diffused damage detection studies have been developed [7 - 13] using optimization algorithms that minimize an " error estimate ". Typically, the employed " error estimates " are calculated by comparing the experimentally measured frequencies of the structure [8] to the respective frequencies predicted by a physics based model that solves a problem of the same structural geometry but with reduced localized properties at a prescribed location [9]. Often, the optimization algorithms identify the model structure that best matches the experimental results, thus identifying the likely location and degree of structural damage manifested through the EI, structural stiffness reduction. For example, Xu et al. [8] developed a damage detection algorithm that monitors the changes in the first 10 transverse frequencies of a vibrating beam as a means of detecting the location and degree of damage along the axis of the beam as measured through a reduced localized structural stiffness. The promising outcomes of their initial studies have been validated through model experiments and have sparke...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} assess {{long-term}} effects on productivity, environmental impacts and soil fertility of contrasting farming practices, six cropping systems, ranging from conventional arable without livestock to organic mixed dairy farming with few arable crops, have been compared since 1989 on a loam soil. A decline in soil structure quality {{was found in a}} conventional arable system with annual ploughing with no rotational grass. This system had higher bulk density and mean aggregate size than other systems, and lower levels of plant available water and aggregate stability. Opposite trends were related to the proportion of grass leys in the other systems and to their levels of soil organic matter. The latter declined markedly over 15 years in the conventional arable system, and there were smaller declines in most other systems. In an arable system without ploughing, but with <b>rotary</b> tillage in <b>spring,</b> organic matter was maintained and high structural stability was found. This system had high bulk density, but the proportion of small aggregates equalled that found in systems with ley. There were overall increases in earthworm density (84...|$|R

Desi*gned displacement of the engine is 1. 77 cm 3 and theoretical compression ratio is 7. 3.

40|$|In the {{existing}} reports regarding free and forced vibrations of the beams, {{most of them}} studied a uniform beam carrying various concentrated elements using Bernoulli-Euler Beam Theory (BET) but without axial force. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to utilize the numerical assembly technique to determine the exact frequency-response amplitudes of the axially-loaded Timoshenko multi-span beam carrying a number of various concentrated elements (including point masses, <b>rotary</b> inertias, linear <b>springs</b> and rotational springs) and subjected to a harmonic concentrated force and the exact natural frequencies and mode shapes of the beam for the free vibration analysis. The model allows analyzing the influence of the shear and axial force and harmonic concentrated force effects and intermediate concentrated elements on the dynamic behavior of the beams by using Timoshenko Beam Theory (TBT). At first, the coefficient matrices for the intermediate concentrated elements, an intermediate pinned support, applied harmonic force, left-end support and right-end support of Timoshenko beam are derived. After the derivation of the coefficient matrices, the numerical assembly technique is used to establish the overall coefficient matrix for the whole vibrating system. Finally, solving the equations associated with the last overall coefficient matrix one determines the exact dynamic response amplitudes of the forced vibrating system corresponding to each specified exciting frequency of the harmonic force. Equating the determinant of the overall coefficient matrix to zero one determines the natural frequencies of the free vibrating system (the case of zero harmonic force) and substituting the corresponding values of integration constants into the related eigenfunctions one determines the associated mode shapes. The calculated vibration amplitudes of the forced vibrating systems and the natural frequencies of the free vibrating systems are given in tables for different values of the axial force. The dynamic response amplitudes and the mode shapes are presented in graphs. The effects of axial force and harmonic concentrated force on the vibration analysis of Timoshenko multi-span beam are also investigated...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable soil {{management}} {{requires that}} the structural degradation is balanced or exceeded by regeneration. Our objective {{was to investigate the}} vulnerability of topsoil structure to stress exerted by intensive tillage or traffic. The study addressed the short-term stability to disturbance as well as the recovery (resilience) within a year. A field experiment was conducted in a randomized block design on a humid sandy loam in 1997 - 1999. Each year, either compaction from a heavy tractor (PAC) or puddling by intensive rotary cultivation (PUD) produced a severe impact on topsoil structure. The PAC and PUD treatments were carried out on wet soil in early spring. The mechanical treatments were referenced by plots (REF), which were left undisturbed until the soil had dried to a friable condition and ready for seedbed preparation. The PAC and PUD treatments were prepared for sowing {{at the same time as}} the reference plots. Penetration resistance was recorded in the spring of 1998 and 1999 to a depth of 200 mm. Soil was sampled from the 0 - 40 mm layer in May 1998 and in March, May and November 1999. The soil was air-dried and separated into four aggregate size fractions. The aggregates were subjected to tensile strength and density measurements. The penetration resistance in the 0 - 200 mm layer ranked in the order PAC>>PUD>REF. Both mechanical treatments significantly increased the density of 4 - 8 mm aggregates. One or two months after the mechanical treatments, they had increased tensile strength relative to REF by 44 % and 33 % in 1998 and by 13 % and 33 % in 1999 for the PAC and PUD treatments, respectively. Thus, our result showed substantial topsoil degradation when exposed to the PAC and PUD treatments, i. e. the sandy loam showed low stability. In November 1999, the PUD-treated aggregates were still markedly stronger than those found in the REF soil. Hence, the PUD-treated soil showed little resilience within a six-month summer period. There was no significant difference in aggregate tensile strength between the treatments in March 1999 after a winter with cycles of freezing and thawing and a mouldboard ploughing operation in early spring. Our results thus imply that soil degradation induced by soil compaction or intensive <b>rotary</b> cultivation early <b>spring</b> may reduce the ease of tillage in the following autumn whereas little residual effect can be expected in the following spring...|$|R
40|$|Manufacturing {{variation}} {{results in}} {{uncertainty in the}} functionality and performance of mechanical assemblies. Management of this uncertainty {{is of paramount importance}} for manufacturing efficiency. Methods focused on the management of uncertainty and variation in the design of mechanical assemblies, such as tolerance analysis and synthesis, have been subject to extensive research and development to date. However, due to the challenges involved, limitations in the capability of these methods remain. These limitations are associated with the following problems: The identification of Key Product Characteristics (KPCs) in mechanical assemblies (which are required for measuring functional performance) without imposing significant modelling demands.  Accommodation of the high computational cost of traditional statistical tolerance analysis in early design where analysis budgets are limited. Efficient identification of feasible regions and optimum performance within the large design spaces associated with early design stages.  The ability to comprehensively accommodate tolerance analysis problems in which assembly functionality is dependent on the effects of loading (such as compliance or multi‐body dynamics). Current Computer Aided Tolerancing (CAT) is limited by: the ability to accommodate only specific loading effects; reliance on custom simulation codes with limited practical implementation in accessible software tools; and, the need for additional expertise in formulating specific assembly tolerance models and interpreting results. Accommodation of the often impractically high computational cost of tolerance synthesis involving demanding assembly models (particularly assemblies under loading). The high computational cost is associated with traditional statistical tolerancing Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) methods reliant on low‐efficiency Monte Carlo (MC) sampling. This research is focused on addressing these limitations, by developing novel methods for enhancing the engineering design of mechanical assemblies involving uncertainty or variation in design parameters. This is achieved by utilising the emerging design analysis and refinement capabilities of Process Integration and Design Optimization (PIDO) tools. ii The main contributions of this research are in three main themes:  Design analysis and refinement accommodating uncertainty in early design;  Tolerancing of assemblies subject to loading; and, efficient Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in tolerance analysis and synthesis. The research outcomes present a number of contributions within each research theme, as outlined below. Design analysis and refinement accommodating uncertainty in early design: A PIDO tool based visualization method to aid designers in identifying assembly KPCs in early design stages. The developed method integrates CAD software functionally with the process integration, UQ, data logging and statistical analysis capabilities of PIDO tools, to simulate manufacturing variation in an assembly and visualise assembly clearances, contacts or interferences. The visualization capability subsequently assists the designer in specifying critical assembly dimensions as KPCs.  Computationally efficient method for manufacturing sensitivity analysis of assemblies with linear‐compliant elements. Reduction in computational cost are achieved by utilising linear‐compliant assembly stiffness measures, reuse of CAD models created in early design stages, and PIDO tool based tolerance analysis. The associated increase in computational efficiency, allows an estimate of sensitivity to manufacturing variation to be made earlier in the design process with low effort.  Refinement of concept design embodiments through PIDO based DOE analysis and optimization. PIDO tools are utilised to allow CAE tool integration, and efficient reuse of models created in early design stages, to rapidly identify feasible and optimal regions in the design space. A case study focused on the conceptual design of automotive seat kinematics is presented, in which an optimal design is identified and subsequently selected for commercialisation in the Tesla Motors Model S full‐sized electric sedan. These contributions can be directly applied to improve the design of mechanical assemblies involving uncertainty or variation in design parameters {{in the early stages of}} design. The use of native CAD/E models developed as part of an established design modelling procedure imposes low additional modelling effort. Tolerancing of assemblies subject to loading:  A novel tolerance analysis platform is developed which integrates CAD/E and statistical analysis tools using PIDO tool capabilities to facilitate tolerance analysis of assemblies subject to loading. The proposed platform extends the capabilities of traditional CAT tools and methods by enabling tolerance analysis of assemblies which are dependent on iii the effects of loads. The ability to accommodate the effects of loading in tolerance analysis allows for an increased level of capability in estimating the effects of variation on functionality.  The interdisciplinary integration capabilities of the PIDO based platform allow for CAD/E models created as part of the standard design process to be used for tolerance analysis. The need for additional modelling tools and expertise is subsequently reduced.  Application of the developed platform resulted in effective solutions to practical, industry based tolerance analysis problems, including: an automotive actuator mechanism assembly consisting of rigid and compliant components subject to external forces; and a <b>rotary</b> switch and <b>spring</b> loaded radial detent assembly in which functionality is defined by external forces and internal multi‐body dynamics. In both case studies the tolerance analysis platform was applied to specify nominal dimensions and required tolerances to achieve the desired assembly yield. The computational platform offers an accessible tolerance analysis approach for accommodating assemblies subject to loading with low implementation demands. Efficient Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) in tolerance analysis and synthesis:  A novel approach is developed for addressing the high computational cost of Monte Carlo (MC) sampling in statistical tolerance analysis and synthesis, with Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) uncertainty quantification. Compared to MC sampling, PCE offers significantly higher efficiency. The feasibility of PCE based UQ in tolerance synthesis is established through: theoretical analysis of the PCE method identifying working principles, implementation requirements, advantages and limitations; identification of a preferred method for determining PCE expansion coefficients in tolerance analysis; and, formulation of an approach for the validation of PCE statistical moment estimates.  PCE based UQ is subsequently implemented in a PIDO based tolerance synthesis platform for assemblies subject to loading. The resultant PIDO based tolerance synthesis platform integrates: highly efficient sparse grid based PCE UQ, parametric CAD/E models accommodating the effects of loading, cost‐tolerance modelling, yield quantification with Process Capability Indices (PCI), optimization of tolerance cost and yield with multiobjective Genetic Algorithm (GA).  To demonstrate the capabilities of the developed platform, two industry based case studies are used for validation, including: an automotive seat rail assembly consisting of compliant components subject to loading; and an automotive switch in assembly in which functionality is defined by external forces and multi‐body dynamics.  In both case studies optimal tolerances were identified which satisfied desired yield and tolerance cost objectives. The addition of PCE to the tolerance synthesis platform resulted in large computational cost reductions without compromising accuracy compared to traditional MC methods. With traditional MC sampling UQ the required computational expense is impractically high. The resulting tolerance synthesis platform can be applied to tolerance analysis and synthesis with significantly reduced computation time while maintaining accurac...|$|R
