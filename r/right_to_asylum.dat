The right to non-refoulement is distinct from the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>asylum.</b> In order to respect the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>asylum</b> states must not deport genuine refugees. In contrast, the right to non-refoulement allows states to transfer genuine refugees to third party countries with respectable human rights records. The portable procedural model, proposed by political philosopher Andy Lamey, emphasizes the right to non-refoulement by guaranteeing refugees three procedural rights (to a verbal hearing, to legal counsel, and to judicial review of detention decisions) and ensuring those rights in the constitution.

Initially, the bridging visas included an entitlement to work. A ‘no work condition’ was added to bridging visas granted from August 2012.

As at September 2015, there were 28, 938 asylum seekers living in the community who had arrived by boat, some with work rights and some without.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{discusses}} {{asylum seekers}} and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> {{work in the}} UK. Differential access to the labour market {{is one of the}} ways in which the state maintains a distinction between British citizens, who ‘belong’, and non-citizens who do not. While such a policy approach garners widespread support amongst the general public of citizens, it does not go uncontested. This article discusses a UK-based campaign, ‘Let Them Work’, which has sought to influence the government in extending the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> work <b>to</b> <b>asylum</b> seekers. In doing so, it demonstrates the ways in which the stratified regime of citizenship rights is contested politically, and explores how such contestation troubles the exclusive privileges of citizenship by enacting mobile solidarities from marginalised spaces...|$|R

The thesis compares the Norwegian and Danish COI agencies and finds differences between their products that question whether the goals of the harmonisation process will be met by 2010. The thesis finds that the two COI agencies are likely to slowly and partially cooperate in the harmonisation process in future because they see it as a potential, yet limited problem-solver, and are sceptical towards its abilities <b>to</b> promote human <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>asylum</b> and its role as a provider of a common European community. Finally, the Norwegian COI agency could have more to win from cooperating, and may therefore become more active in the harmonisation process than the Danish office...|$|R
40|$|Th is article {{compares the}} “right to seek and enjoy asylum” {{enshrined}} in Art. 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights {{with the current}} EU policy developments to “externalize” or “extraterritorialise” migration control and refugee protection. Examining the genesis of Art. 14 during the negotiations of the Universal Declaration, {{it is argued that}} while Art. 14 clearly falls short of granting a substantive <b>right</b> <b>to</b> be granted <b>asylum,</b> its formulation was intended to maintain a procedural right – the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> an <b>asylum</b> process. While the Universal Declaration is not a legally binding instrument, going back to the fundamental norms expressed herein nonetheless provides an important starting point for evaluating current policies, especially in light of recent critiques against overly expansive interpretation of human rights law. As such, the article concludes that the current EU policies to shift migration control and refugee protection away from Europe in important respects contravenes “the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> seek asylum” as it was conceived exactly 60 years ago...|$|R
