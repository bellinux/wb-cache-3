5000|$|The Principal Group was {{primarily}} three companies: First Investors Corporation, Associated Investors of Canada and Principal Savings and Trust Corporation. First Investors Corporation {{was established by}} Donald Cormie in 1954. [...] The company was initially based in Edmonton, Alberta. The company sold investment contracts, which were contracts by which investors remitted monthly amounts to First Investors Corporation, {{in return for a}} promised future <b>redemption</b> <b>amount,</b> plus interest. In 1959, First Investors opened offices in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland. At the same time, it also opened offices in Washington, Oregon and Colorado as Principal Investors, since the First Investors name was owned in the United States by another party.

The notes were usually backed by United States bonds the bank deposited with the United States Treasury.

30|$|In this section, we {{analyze the}} impact of such {{covenants}} {{on the cost of}} debt. A high bankruptcy threshold enforces an earlier redemption of debt. However, this is only beneficial for bondholders if bankruptcy costs are sufficiently low. Otherwise, they get an early redemption with high probability, but the <b>redemption</b> <b>amount</b> may be quite low. Whether a bond covenant, given by a bankruptcy threshold, provides an additional value to bondholders, therefore, crucially depends on the bankruptcy costs α.|$|E
40|$|In a roll-up mortgage, the {{borrower}} receives a loan {{in the form}} of a lump sum. The loan is rolled up with interest until {{the borrower}} dies, sells the house, or moves into long-term care permanently. The house is sold at that time, and the proceeds are used to repay the loan and interest. Most roll-up mortgages are sold with a no-negative-equity guarantee (NNEG), which caps the <b>redemption</b> <b>amount</b> at the lesser of the face amount of the loan and the sale proceeds. The core of this study is to develop a framework for pricing and managing the risks of the NNEG. Copyright (c) The Journal of Risk and Insurance, 2009. ...|$|E
30|$|Not surprisingly, {{the effect}} is least {{pronounced}} for the investment-grade firm. For this firm, {{the probability that a}} default event occurs or the covenant becomes effective is quite low, so the covenant has no great impact on the cost of debt. For the highly leveraged firm in contrast, the impact is large. When bankruptcy costs are high, the covenant triggers the early default with low redemption and destroys bondholder value, resulting in higher costs of debt. When bankruptcy costs are low, the <b>redemption</b> <b>amount</b> in the case of default is close to the face value of debt, so bondholders bear a little risk, moving the cost of debt closer to the risk-free rate.|$|E
40|$|The open-end {{funds have}} {{liquidity}} risk, {{one of the}} main reasons !a the open-end fund huge redemption is elaborated, th paper uses the extreme value theory measure the liquidity risk. Through the analysis, we found that the extreme application fit to forecast open-end fund <b>redemption</b> <b>amount</b> of their probability of occurrence, and use maximum likelihood method to estimate the parameters and goodness-of-fit test. This paper also uses the Monte Carlo method to the results for further simulation experiments, and forecast the mean and standard deviation of the redemption of the fund. Fund managers may, under certain probability, predict funds for the redemption, resulting in an appropriate reserve of cash, avoiding reasonably the open-end fund which provides liquidity risk. That is a good prediction method...|$|E
