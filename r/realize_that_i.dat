500|$|After divorcing Ike in 1978, Tina abstained {{from serious}} {{relationships}} {{for a long}} time, as she set on bringing her career back on track. In 1986 she said, [...] "People have to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{just got out of}} a very difficult marriage. I'm not the type of woman who needs to jump back into another. I liked my freedom when I got out of that one. I've had a few love affairs, but nothing important." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Back to the Shack" [...] {{deals with}} the theme of nostalgia and a wish to return [...] "to [...] 1994 roots". Dave Lewis stated the song serves as a {{thematic}} continuation of two previous Weezer songs, [...] "In the Garage" [...] and [...] "Memories". It also deals with Weezer's relationship with their fans and serves as [...] "basically an apology {{for the past two}} decades and a promise to embrace their nerdy roots." [...] The song's opening lines—"I'm sorry guys, I didn't <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> needed you so much"—in particular reinforce this theme. The song has been categorized under alternative rock and power pop.|$|E
500|$|The lecture {{caused a}} storm of controversy, even at the {{reception}} immediately following his talk. Many English professors in attendance were upset by his remarks; one elderly professor reportedly approached him, said: [...] "How dare you!", and stormed away. Another suggested that Achebe had [...] "no sense of humour", but several days later Achebe was approached by a third professor, who told him: [...] "I now <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had never really read Heart of Darkness although I have taught it for years." [...] Although the lecture angered many of his colleagues, he was nevertheless presented later in 1975 with an honorary doctorate from the University of Stirling and the Lotus Prize for Afro-Asian Writers.|$|E

5000|$|On July 27, 2005, Malar Balasubramaniam's {{brother and}} sister {{received}} an email from her. Parts of this email read, [...] "Once <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> won't succeed the way I wanted to in life and decided to end it, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> couldn't leave you two alone with Amma" [...] ("Amma" [...] means [...] "mother") and [...] "I'm sorry for what I did to Amma, I am, but I'm glad she's not here to hurt us anymore." ...|$|R

500|$|He {{released}} Diamond Dreams in 2008. The {{album was}} a collaboration with Kent Goodson, pianist for country star George Jones. It tells baseball stories inspired by West's umpiring career. Goodson later said, [...] "As I {{look back on}} how this CD came together, I <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am a musician and Joe is an umpire. But his love for music and my love for baseball bonded us in this project." [...] Sports blogger Voodoo Brown described West as [...] "in creepmode from the gate." [...] Sportswriter Doug Miller said that the album was [...] "a fun, humorous and often touching collection of spoken-word gems in which the listener gets a perfect sampling of the true personality of Cowboy Joe West." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{biological}} father of Superman. Sean Penn and Clive Owen were also {{considered for the}} role. Crowe incorporates how his own fatherhood informed his reading of the script to portray Jor-El, stating that [...] "...it {{was one of those}} things where that's how it was connecting me. That's the question that Jor-El faces, that's the situation that he's in." [...] Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that: [...] "When I signed on... well, one, I didn't <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would be wearing Spandex—'cause you know that's Superman's costume—I didn't realize that I'd have to fit into it as well," [...] Crowe said. [...] "But, I also didn't realize the type of organizer that Zack Snyder is, 'cause this was really old school prep. This is sort of David Lean-level preparation, and I really appreciated him. And I was on the movie for three-and-a-half or four months before I even got in front of the camera." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the Palm Beach media {{attention}} and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A Gallup Poll gave Kennedy {{a very low}} 22percent national approval rating. A Boston Herald/WCVB-TV poll found that 62 percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for re-election, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy had misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor William Weld by 25points. Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991, dinner party, Kennedy saw Victoria Anne Reggie, a Washington lawyer at Keck, Mahin & Cate, a divorced mother of two, and {{the daughter of an}} old Kennedy family ally, Louisiana judge Edmund Reggie. They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship. In a late October speech at the John F. Kennedy School of Government, Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: [...] "I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings– the faults in the conduct of my private life. I <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them." [...] In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the O. J. Simpson murder case three years later. Kennedy's testimony at the trial seemed relaxed, confident, and forthcoming, and helped convince the public that his involvement had been peripheral and unintended. Smith was acquitted.|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{headed for}} a group of Japanese aircraft, and due to a {{combination}} of clouds and smoke, he unintentionally entered the middle of the formation of seven or eight A6M Zeros. A Japanese rear-gunner from a dive bomber fired at Taylor's aircraft and one of the bullets came within an inch of Taylor's head and exploded in the cockpit. One piece went through his left arm and shrapnel entered his leg. Taylor reflected on the injuries in a 2001 interview, saying [...] "It was of no consequence; it just {{scared the hell out of}} me for a minute." [...] A few years after the interview, Taylor received from his crew chief two other slugs that had been found behind his seat. Welch shot down the dive bomber aircraft that had injured Taylor, and Taylor damaged another aircraft (his second probable kill) before pulling away to assist Welch with a pursuing A6M Zero fighter. The Zero and the rest of its formation soon broke off the pursuit and left to return to their carriers as Taylor neared Welch. Taylor continued to fire on several Japanese aircraft until he ran out of ammunition. Both pilots headed back to Haleiwa. After landing and driving back to Wheeler, Taylor and Welch passed by their squadron commander, Major Gordon H. Austin, who noticed that they were wearing their tuxedo attire. Unaware of their earlier dogfights, he shouted at the two men, saying [...] "Get back to Haleiwa! You know there's a war on?" [...] The two pilots explained what they had done, and the commander thanked them. In a 2003 interview, Taylor reflected on his actions: [...] "I wasn't in the least bit terrified, and let me tell you why: I was too young and too stupid to <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was in a lot of danger." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dani first {{appeared}} in the 1999 song [...] "Californication", which includes the lyrics [...] "Teenage bride with a baby inside/Gettin' high on information" [...] although the girl's name is not specified. She was next mentioned in the Red Hot Chili Peppers' 2002 single [...] "By the Way" [...] as [...] "Dani the girl". Kiedis commented: [...] "When this funky groove came up it struck me as a perfect place to actually tell a story. It sort of revealed itself to me that it's been the same character, just kind of developing. At first I didn't <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was writing about the same girl." ...|$|E
2500|$|I <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shouldn't be {{surprised}} at God's doing things that I can't explain. [...] I shouldn't doubt His existence just because I find that I sometimes can't understand why or how He has made something. [...] I know that my nature is weak and limited and that God's is limitless, incomprehensible, and infinite, and, from this, I can infer that He can do innumerable things whose reasons are unknown to me. [...] On this ground alone, I regard the common practice of explaining things {{in terms of their}} purposes to be useless in physics: it would be foolhardy of me to think that I can discover God's purposes.

[...] "In the seventies, Carter taught me what I was against, {{and then in the}} eighties, Reagan taught me what I was for." [...] She also details why she {{went to work for the}} Internal Revenue Service. She says it was because she wanted to change the tax code, [...] "from the inside out." [...] She also commented on her role as a Tea Party leader. [...] "I once said that the Tea Party represents 90 percent of Americans. I now <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> misspoke," [...] she admitted. [...] "I should have said 100 percent, because I believe that nearly all Americans retain faith in the ordered liberty that the Constitution offers." ...|$|E
