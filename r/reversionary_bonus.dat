60|$|Hence, from general, special, as well, no doubt, for {{the usual}} {{prudential}} and benevolent considerations, there {{came to be}} established among railway officers and servants, nine years ago, the Railway Benevolent Association. I may suppose, therefore, as it was established nine years ago, {{that this is the}} ninth occasion of publishing from this chair the banns between this institution and the public. Nevertheless, I feel bound individually to do my duty the same as if it had never been done before, and to ask whether there is any just cause or impediment why these two parties--the institution and the public--should not be joined together in holy charity. As I understand the society, its objects are five-fold--first, to guarantee annuities which, it is always to be observed, is paid out of the interest of invested capital, so that those annuities may be secure and safe--annual pensions, varying from 10 to 25 pounds, to distressed railway officers and servants incapacitated by age, sickness, or accident; secondly, to guarantee small pensions to distressed widows; thirdly, to educate and maintain orphan children; fourthly, to provide temporary relief for all those classes till lasting relief can be guaranteed out of funds sufficiently large for the purpose; lastly, to induce railway officers and servants to assure their lives in some well- established office by sub-dividing the payment of the premiums into small periodical sums, and also by granting a <b>reversionary</b> <b>bonus</b> of 10 pounds per cent. on the amount assured from the funds of the institution.|$|E
50|$|A <b>reversionary</b> <b>bonus</b> {{is awarded}} during {{the term of}} the {{insurance}} contract, and guaranteed to be paid at maturity. It cannot be removed after declaration. The annual bonus may consist of two parts. The guaranteed bonus is an amount normally expressed as a monetary amount per £1,000 sum assured. It is set {{at the outset of}} the policy and usually cannot be varied. The rest of the annual bonus will depend on the investment return achieved by the fund subject to smoothing.|$|E
25|$|Many of Equitable's with-profits {{policies}} {{were designed to}} provide a pension for the policyholder on retirement, and the lump sum available to buy an annuity depended on the sum assured, the <b>reversionary</b> <b>bonuses</b> and the larger terminal bonus. Both types of bonus were allocated at the discretion of the directors in accordance with Article 65 of the Articles of Association, the total being intended to reflect the investment return earned over the lifetime of the policy, subject to smoothing.|$|R

Both types of bonus were allocated at the discretion of the directors in accordance with Article 65 of the Articles of Association, the total being intended to reflect the investment return earned over the lifetime of the policy, subject to smoothing.Between 1956 and the advent of Personal Pension Schemes in July 1988, Equitable sold policies with an option to choose at the retirement date between a fixed Guaranteed Annuity Rate (GAR) or the Current Annuity Rate (i.e. the market annuity rate at that time) (CAR). The latter reflected the anticipated investment return on the lump sum over the annuity holder's lifetime and often changed depending on long-term interest yields and views on future longevity. No additional premium was charged in respect of the guarantee.|$|R
50|$|There is {{an amount}} {{guaranteed}} to be paid out called the sum assured and this can be increased {{on the basis of}} investment performance through the addition of periodic (for example annual) bonuses. Regular bonuses (sometimes referred to as <b>reversionary</b> <b>bonuses)</b> are guaranteed at maturity and a further non-guarantee bonus may be paid at the end known as a terminal bonus. During adverse investment conditions, the encashment value or surrender value may be reduced by a 'Market Value Reduction' or MVR (It is sometime referred to as a market value adjustment but this is a term in decline through pressure from the Financial Conduct Authority to use clearer terms). The idea of such a measure is to protect the investors who remain in the fund from others withdrawing funds with notional values that are, or risk being, in excess of the value of underlying assets at a time when stock markets are low. If an MVA applies an early surrender would be reduced according to the policies adopted by the funds managers at the time.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{sum assured}} attracts {{reversionary}} bonuses {{which are used}} to distribute profits to the policy. Once a <b>reversionary</b> <b>bonus</b> is added it cannot {{be removed from the}} policy. The required premiums must have been maintained to receive payment of the basic sum assured and bonuses. If the premiums have not been maintained a reduced amount (or in some cases none) will be paid. For insurance bonds the basic sum assured plus bonuses represents the plan value. When the policy matures, a final bonus may be added to reflect the policy's share of profits which have not yet been distributed.|$|E

40|$|The {{heyday of}} the {{friendly}} society movement in Australia, which spanned {{from the early days}} of colonisation until the mid- 1930 's, saw friendly societies as the main provider of social welfare benefits for {{a large proportion of the}} population. Since the advent of the modern 'welfare state', the movement drifted steadily into a state of decline. The 1980 's, however, have heralded a remarkable rejuuination of the movement, based upon traditional friendly society ideals of providence and thrift. Instigating this revival are Victoria's friendly societies which now market an array of endowment type life assurance policies, designed to promote savings and investment returns for the movement's now diverse and rapidly growing membership. All Commonwealth insurance legislation specifically excludes insurances effected by friendly societies, and from a casual reading of the Victorian Friendly Societies Act 1958, the legislative power for societies to effect life assurances is y no means immediately apparent. Indeed, a closer reading of nineteenth this Act highlights that its / century English based provisions are inadequate, and often unintelligible so far as regulating and providing a satisfactory framework for the operation of modern friendly society life assurance activities. This paper provides a practical description of friendly society endowment assurances, and examines their legal nature and operation by tracing the legislative evolution of the enabling provision. The regulation and operation of these assurances within the scope of the Friendly Societies Act, is discussed at length, and where appropriate, critically analysed. Throughout the paper comparisons between Commonwealth life insurance legislation, which regulates similar assurances, is made with a view to further highlight the inadequacies of the present friendly society legislation. By design, Part 1 is very much descriptive in its content. This is due not only to the fact that modern friendly society life assurances have received little, or no legal comment, but also because a basic understanding of the nature and operation of these assurances is a prerequisite to the discussion of their taxation implications in Part 2. In Part 2, the paper essentially focuses on the taxation consequences of ownership of a friendly society life assurance policy. It does this by looking at the long standing traditional tax concessions applicable to these policies. These take the form of 'tax-free' <b>reversionary</b> <b>bonuses</b> attaching to life assurance policies generally, and until recently, a rebate for contributions. The discussion analyses in detail, recent legislative changes, which coincidental with the dramatic increase in friendly society assurance activities, have been introduced to prevent exploitation of these traditional taxation concessions. Brief attention is also given to the taxation status of the friendly societies themselves. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
5000|$|The Society, {{established}} via a Deed of Trust in September 1762 {{with the}} name of the [...] "Society for Equitable Assurances on Lives and Survivorships", offered both whole life and fixed term policies. Premiums, which were constant {{for the duration of the}} policy, were based on a method devised by the mathematician James Dodson using mortality figures for Northampton and the amount payable on death, the basic sum assured, was guaranteed, a major advantage at the time.As Dodson had died five years earlier, Edward Rowe Mores became its chief executive officer with the title of actuary—the first use of the term—though he was an administrator rather than a statistician.The first modern actuary, William Morgan, was appointed in 1775 and served until 1830.
