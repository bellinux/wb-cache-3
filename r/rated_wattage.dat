5000|$|One of {{the factors}} bassists {{keep in mind when}} {{selecting}} a combo amp or an amp head is the amount of [...] "headroom" [...] that the amplifier will provide them, given their intended performance venue and music genre. [...] "Headroom" [...] refers to the amount by which the signal-handling capabilities of an audio system exceed a designated nominal level. Headroom {{can be thought of as}} a safety zone allowing transient audio peaks to exceed the nominal level without damaging the system or the audio signal, e.g., via clipping. In loud music genres and in genres where bassists seek a clean, clear bass tone, bassists seek to avoid power amplifier clipping, so they typically choose amplifiers which provide enough headroom to avoid power amp clipping. Headroom has been defined as a [...] "...safety zone or wiggle room"."Having enough headroom is essential for solid-state equipment like bass amplifiers and power amplifiers. If you lack this, you can expect a harsh mid range tone, a lack of dynamics and possibly blown speakers". Having enough headroom is also important for bassists seeking to retain a [...] "clean" [...] sound even in loud, high-volume performance settings.Bassists pairing an amplifier [...] "head" [...] of a certain wattage and a speaker cabinet (or speaker cabinets) with a certain wattage power-handling capacity may require advice from music store amplifier expert or an audio engineer. One of the reasons that many beginning bassists choose combo amps when they are starting is because with a combo amp, the manufacturer has ensured that the speaker and power amp are compatible from a power handling and impedance perspective. While there is a widespread belief that an amplifier with a <b>rated</b> <b>wattage</b> that is higher than the <b>rated</b> <b>wattage</b> on a speaker cabinet will harm the speaker, in fact, a clean, un-clipped power amplifier signal can be above the <b>rated</b> <b>wattage</b> of a speaker without damaging the speaker, as long as the power amp is sending out a clean, unclipped signal. There is a much higher risk of damaging a speaker when a clipped (unintentionally distorted) power amplifier signal is sent through it, even if the wattage is far below the <b>rated</b> <b>wattage</b> of a speaker. For example, a bassist could use a 700 watt power amp which is running with zero power amp clipping through a speaker cabinet rated at 500 watts without damaging the speaker; however, if a 100 watt power amp that is heavily clipping is plugged into the speaker cab, this could blow the speaker.|$|E
5000|$|Most bass amps {{have only}} one <b>rated</b> <b>wattage.</b> A small number of amps, such as the Mesa/Boogie Strategy 88 amp head, have {{switchable}} wattage. A selector switch on the 88 enables the bassist to choose its full 465 watt power; half power (250 watts); or low power (125 watts). A bassist playing an arena on one night, then a club gig, and then recording in a studio could use full, half and low power for the different volume requirements.The way that manufacturers state the wattage output of an amplifier can be confusing. Amplifier manufacturers may state that a combo bass amp produces 600 watts at 4 ohms and 300 watts at 8 ohms. If the speaker mounted in the combo amp is an 8 ohm speaker, then the combo by itself will only produce 300 watts. This combo amplifier will only put out 600 watts if an [...] "extension speaker cabinet" [...] is plugged into the combo amp with a speaker cable. Plugging a second 8 ohm cabinet in parallel wiring with the combo amp's internal 8 ohm speaker will lower the amp's impedance (electrical resistance or [...] "load") to 4 ohms; {{at this point the}} amp will put out 600 watts. Another factor that can make it difficult for bassists to select a bass amp is that difficult manufacturers may state their amps wattage in Root Mean Squared (or [...] "RMS") and in [...] "peak power". For example, a bass amp ad may state that it produces 500 watts RMS and 1000 watts [...] "peak power". The RMS figure is much more important than the peak power wattage.The way that cabinet manufacturers state the power handling capabilities of a speaker cabinet (or an individual speaker) can also be confusing. An important figure for a speaker cabinet's power handling capabilities is its rated wattage-handling capabilities as [...] "RMS". For example, a bass speaker cabinet's back panel may state that it has a power handling capacity of 500 watts RMS. This means that the speaker can handle an average power, from a power amplifier, of 500 watts. The speaker can also handle occasional peaks or [...] "transient" [...] bursts of higher wattages, so long as these are brief. Where is becomes confusing is that some manufacturers also list [...] "peak power", also called [...] "maximum power", [...] "max power" [...] or [...] "burst power". Peak power is the power-handling ability of the speaker for very short bursts of high-wattage signal. The RMS figure is much more important than the [...] "peak power" [...] or [...] "max power" [...] figure. To add to the confusion, some manufacturers state the [...] "program power" [...] capabilities of their speaker cabinet, a vague and undefined term. Reputable, major manufacturers state the RMS output and/or power-handling capabilities of their gear.|$|E
5000|$|The Marshalls used EL-34 output tubes, {{but those}} could barely reach the <b>rated</b> output <b>wattage.</b> Therefore, Unicord would {{replace them with}} KT-88 tubes before {{shipping}} to U.S. vendors.|$|R
5000|$|... "Cranking an amp" [...] means {{turning up}} a guitar power {{amplifier}} {{well into the}} region at which power-tube distortion is produced, generating as much as twice the amplifier's <b>rated</b> non-distorting <b>wattage.</b> Pushing a guitar amp {{to such an extent}} can destroy components of an amplifier whether using an isolation cabinet, dummy load, power attenuator, or conventional guitar speaker cabinet. In particular, tubes wear more quickly when they are consistently pushed into saturation.|$|R
40|$|The Safety Analysis Report for the TRUPACT-II Shipping Package [Transuranic Package Transporter-II (TRUPACT-II) SARP] {{set limits}} for gas {{generation}} <b>rates,</b> <b>wattage</b> limits, and flammable {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) concentrations in transuranic (TRU) waste containers that would be shipped to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). Based on existing headspace gas data for drums stored at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) and the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS), over 30 percent of the contact-handled TRU waste drums contain flammable VOC concentrations greater than the limit. Additional requirements may be imposed for emplacement of waste in the WIPP facility. The conditional no-migration determination (NMD) for the test phase of the facility required that flame tests be performed if significant levels of flammable VOCs were present in TRU waste containers. This paper describes an approach for investigating the potential flammability of TRU waste drums, which would increase the allowable concentrations of flammable VOCS. A flammability assessment methodology is presented that will allow more drums to be shipped to WIPP without treatment or repackaging and {{reduce the need for}} flame testing on drums. The approach includes experimental work to determine mixture lower explosive limits (MLEL) for the types of gas mixtures observed in TRU waste, a model for predicting the MLEL for mixtures of VOCS, hydrogen, and methane, and revised screening limits for total flammable VOCs concentrations and concentrations of hydrogen and methane using existing drum headspace gas data and the model predictions...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{tracking}} and monitoring in homes has gained momentum {{in recent years}} due to its important implications in energy conservation and economic savings. Many existing systems require deployment of large number of sensors to provide energy tracking of individual devices. Many other systems rely on statistical data or user inputs to disaggregate the total energy. In this report we present a cost effective and a single-point pluggable system which can track the energy consumption of individual devices. We also introduce evaluation metrics to verify the power disaggregation. The system uses a single plugin data acquisition unit to detect device events and a power meter to record the total power consumption. We test the system on a real circuit that models a house with different devices. Entracker could account and breakdown over 95 % of the total energy. Our estimation of the average device power consumption {{was close to the}} <b>rated</b> power <b>wattage</b> of the devices. ...|$|R
5000|$|Many DrV64s shipped internationally {{were ordered}} without an {{installed}} CD-ROM drive, {{to save on}} shipping costs associated with weight, import duty on the drive and the ever increasing speeds of drives available. While theoretically a benefit in the user being able {{to use their own}} faster/cheaper drive, the variance in power draw of different manufacturers drives at different speeds caused issues with discs spin-ups up exceeding the <b>wattage</b> <b>rating</b> of the included Bung PSU. This led to users swapping out the Bung PSU for a more powerful model, or selecting low draw drives (mainly Panasonic drives sometimes badged as Creative).|$|R
50|$|One {{other problem}} can {{happen with the}} <b>wattage</b> <b>rating</b> of the power supply. There are 2 Dell power {{supplies}} that were used for different Inspiron models which have the same plug assembly and voltage, a 65 watt supply model PA-6 and a 90 watt supply model PA-9. Some models (for example the Inspiron 1100) shipped with a PA-9. If a PA-6 (or equivalent aftermarket supply) is used in these models then the system might not boot at times. In such cases, it will light the battery light {{for a few seconds}} when the supply is plugged in. This can also happen if the power supply becomes marginal. Marginal supplies can show as supplying full voltage even if tested with a volt meter while the supply is plugged into the computer and an attempt is made to turn on the computer.|$|R
40|$|China has had {{an active}} program on energy {{efficiency}} standards for household appliances since the mid- 1990 s. Rice cooker is {{among the first to}} be subject to such mandatory regulation, since {{it is one of the}} most prevalent electric appliances in Chinese households. Since first introduced in 1989, the minimum energy efficiency standard for rice cookers has not been revised. Therefore, the potential for energy saving is considerable. Initial analysis from CNIS indicates that potential carbon savings is likely to reach 7. 6 million tons of CO 2 by the 10 th year of the standard implementation. Since September 2007, CNIS has been working with various groups to develop the new standard for rice cookers. With The Energy Foundation's support, LBNL has assisted CNIS in the revision of the minimum energy efficiency standard for rice cookers that is expected to be effective in 2009. Specifically, work has been in the following areas: assistance in developing consumer survey on usage pattern of rice cookers, review of international standards, review of international test procedures, comparison of the international standards and test procedures, and assessment of technical options of reducing energy use. This report particularly summarizes the findings of reviewing international standards and technical options of reducing energy consumption. The report consists of an overview of rice cooker standards and labeling programs and testing procedures in Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan and Thailand, and Japan's case study in developing energy efficiency rice cooker technologies and rice cooker efficiency programs. The results from the analysis can be summarized as the follows: Hong Kong has a Voluntary Energy Efficiency Labeling scheme for electric rice cookers initiated in 2001, with revision implemented in 2007; South Korea has both MEPS and Mandatory Energy Efficiency Label targeting the same category of rice cookers as Hong Kong; Thailand's voluntary endorsement labeling program is similar to Hong Kong in program design but has 5 efficiency grades; Japan's program is distinct in its adoption of the 'Top Runner' approach, in which, the future efficiency standards is set based on the efficiency levels of the most efficient product in the current domestic market. Although the standards are voluntary, penalties can still be evoked if the average efficiency target is not met. Both Hong Kong and South Korea's tests involve pouring water into the inner pot equal to 80 % of its rated volume; however, white rice is used as a load for its tests in Hong Kong whereas no rice is used for tests in South Korea. In Japan's case, water level specified by the manufactures is used and milled rice is used as a load only partially in the tests. Moreover, Japan does not conduct heat efficiency test but its energy consumption measurements tests are much more complex, with 4 different tests are conducted to determine the annual average energy consumption. Hong Kong and Thailand both set Minimum Allowable Heat Efficiency for different <b>rated</b> <b>wattages.</b> The energy efficiency requirements are identical except that the minimum heat efficiency in Thailand is 1 percentage point higher for all rated power categories. In South Korea, MEPS and label's energy efficiency grades are determined by the rice cooker's Rated Energy Efficiency for induction, non-induction, pressure, nonpressure rice cookers. Japan's target standard values are set for electromagnetic induction heating products and non-electromagnetic induction heating products by different size of rice cookers. Specific formulas are used by type and size depending on the mass of water evaporation of the rice cookers. Japan has been the leading country in technology development of various types of rice cookers, and developed concrete energy efficiency standards for rice cookers. However, as consumers in Japan emphasize the deliciousness of cooked rice over other factors, many types of models were developed to improve the taste of cooked rice. Nonetheless, the efficiency of electromagnetic induction heating (IH) rice cookers in warm mode has improved approximately 12 percent from 1993 to 2004 due to the 'low temperature warming method' developed by manufacturers. The Energy Conservation Center of Japan (IEEJ) releases energy saving products database on the web regularly, on which the energy saving performance of each product is listed and ranked. Energy saving in rice cookers mostly rest with insulation of the pot. Technology developed to improve the energy efficiency of the rice cookers includes providing vacuum layers on both side of the pot, using copper-plated materials, and double stainless layer lid that can be heated and steam can run in between the two layers to speed the heating process...|$|R
