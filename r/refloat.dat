5|$|In {{an attempt}} to <b>refloat</b> her, Captain Pearce ordered Gothenburg to be {{lightened}} forward. Water casks used as ballast and passengers were positioned aft in an endeavour to <b>refloat</b> her as the tide rose, but without success. Finally, a fatal {{attempt was made to}} <b>refloat</b> her, by reversing the engine hard. The vessel came half off the reef, but holed herself badly and then slewed broadside to the waves, in a much worse position. However, with the tide rising and some cargo now being dumped overboard, all aboard still expected Gothenburg to float free. With strong winds changing direction and seas increasing, the boiler fires were extinguished by water rising through the damaged stern. Around midnight, the chief engineer came on deck to report that the engine room was flooded and the engine was of no further use. With heavy seas now rushing down hatchways and into the cabins, Gothenburg was doomed and Captain Pearce was forced to admit that the situation had become desperate.|$|E
5|$|As abandoned, Utah {{cleared her}} berth. There was no further attempt to <b>refloat</b> her; unlike the battleships sunk at Battleship Row, {{she had no}} {{military}} value. She was formally placed out of commission on 5 September 1944, and then stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 13 November. Utah received one battle star for her brief service during World War II. Her rusting hulk remains in Pearl Harbor, partially above water; the men killed when Utah sank were never removed from the wreck, and as such, she is considered a war grave.|$|E
5|$|She {{was briefly}} {{refitted}} at Diégo-Suarez, Madagascar from 13 March to mid-April {{when she was}} transferred to the Mediterranean. Léopard arrived in Alexandria, Egypt, on 12 May and screened a convoy to Malta shortly afterwards. She departed on 24 May with a convoy returning to Alexandria and accidentally ran aground near Benghazi three days later after aerial attacks disrupted the convoy. The Allies attempted to <b>refloat</b> her, but they failed and the wreck broke in two on 19 June and was declared a total loss on 1 July.|$|E

5|$|The initial salvage {{attempts}} were unsuccessful and the Espingole was struck off the naval register on 16 September. The navy sold her wreck at auction in December 1909 {{and decided to}} offer an escalating series of bonuses if the winner could <b>refloat</b> the ship and deliver it intact. The salvage company was no more successful and abandoned the effort after five months of work. The company claimed that the navy had disturbed the wreck and sued for 60,000 francs plus damages. The dispute was not settled until 3 March 1926.|$|E
5|$|While {{entering}} Puerto San Bartolomé in Baja California {{in early}} 1915, Asama struck an uncharted rock and was badly damaged. It took months to <b>refloat</b> {{her and to}} make her partially seaworthy. The ship was given temporary repairs at the British naval base at Esquimalt, British Columbia before arriving back in Japan in December where permanent repairs were not completed until March 1917. Asama {{was assigned to the}} Training Squadron later that year and made another cadet training cruise in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the disability to the British ship, Troude pulled Formidable ahead in light winds, slowly rejoining the main squadron under Moreno, which was holding station off Cadiz harbour. As Formidable moved away, the remaining masts on Venerable collapsed and the ship grounded off Sancti Petri. There was concern in the British squadron that Moreno might counterattack the disabled ship, but the arrival on the horizon of Audacious and Superb persuaded the Spanish admiral to withdraw into Cadiz. Hood was able to <b>refloat</b> Venerable on 13 July and the ship was towed back to Gibraltar with the prize Saint Antoine. Saumarez left three ships to maintain the blockade at Cadiz, returning the situation off the port to that before the battle.|$|E

5|$|The crew of Apropos had run her ashore {{soon after}} Emerald {{had entered the}} harbour. The harbour {{batteries}} having been destroyed, Captain Maitland sent a further force under Midshipman Baird to secure and <b>refloat</b> the French ship. The original landing party under Lieutenant Bertram, which had already encountered and dispersed 60 members of the schooner's crew, met Baird's party on the beach. The British made several unsuccessful attempts to re-float the schooner before being forced to set her afire and depart. British casualties were heavy. Emerald had nine men killed, and 16 wounded, including Lieutenant Bertram. Maitland estimated that French casualties too had been heavy.|$|E
5|$|Alligator left Matanzas on 18 November escorting her prizes {{back to the}} United States. The {{following}} day, she ran hard aground on a {{coral reef}} in the Florida Keys, which has since been named Alligator Reef. Her crew failed to <b>refloat</b> the vessel, but managed to salvage her guns, papers, and other valuables. Fearing {{that she would be}} salvaged by pirates, they burnt her and she sank. Though it was previously thought that the location of the wreck was known, a 1996 expedition proved this false, and the precise location of Alligator final resting place remains unknown. Allen was regarded by the Navy as a hero for his efforts against the pirates, and his name was used as a rallying cry the following year when USS Galliniper and USS Mosquito engaged and defeated a band of pirates led by Diabolito near the same area where the American lieutenant had been slain.|$|E
5|$|Amiral Charner {{spent most}} of her career in the Mediterranean, {{although}} she was sent to China during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900–01. Together with her sisters, Chanzy and Latouche-Tréville, the ship was assigned to the International Squadron off the island of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 to protect French interests and citizens. With the exception of Bruix, the sisters {{spent most of}} {{the first decade of the}} 20th century as training ships or in reserve. Bruix served in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, and in the Far East before World War I. In 1902 she aided survivors of the devastating eruption of Mount Pelée on the island of Martinique and spent several years as guardship at Crete, protecting French interests in the region in the early 1910s. Chanzy was transferred to French Indochina in 1906. She ran aground off the Chinese coast in mid-1907, where she proved impossible to <b>refloat</b> and was destroyed in place after her crew was rescued without loss.|$|E

5|$|Continued poor weather drove New Carissa {{closer to}} the shore. Technical teams from two salvage contractors, Smit International and Salvage Master, had {{been working with the}} Coast Guard since February 5 and had drawn up plans to attempt to <b>refloat</b> the vessel, but when cracks in the hull and oil leaks were {{observed}} on February 8, any refloating attempts were precluded by the focus on preventing of a large-scale oil spill. In addition, Salvage Chief, upon her arrival, was unable to reach New Carissa with her tow gear. On February 10, New Carissa suffered major structural failure when the hull breached near the engine room, flooding the engines with seawater (and thus disabling them). The ship's insurers declared the vessel to be a total loss. As a result, New Carissa was no longer a salvageable vessel; instead, she had effectively become a shipwreck.|$|E
5|$|Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand {{was built}} at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{dockyard}} in Trieste. She was laid down on 12 September 1907 and launched from the slipway on 8 September 1908. The teak used on her deck was the only material Austria-Hungary purchased abroad to build her. A {{month and a half}} after her launch, she was towed to the harbor in Muggia for completion. During a severe storm that night, she broke loose from her moorings; with no crewmen aboard, Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand drifted for several hours before running aground just off Izola. The following morning, the navy located her and started to <b>refloat</b> her. Completion was delayed by a welders' strike in 1908 and a riveters' strike in 1909. Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand was the first ship of the class to be completed, and she was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 5 June 1910.|$|E
5|$|The Amiral Charner {{class was}} a group of four {{armoured}} cruisers built for the French Navy during the 1890s. They were designed to be smaller and cheaper than the preceding design while also serving as commerce raiders in times of war. Three of the ships were assigned to the International Squadron off the island of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 to protect French interests and citizens. With several exceptions the sister ships spent most of {{the first decade of the}} 20th century serving as training ships or in reserve. Bruix aided survivors of the devastating eruption of Mount Pelée on the island of Martinique in 1902. Chanzy was transferred to French Indochina in 1906 and ran aground off the Chinese coast in mid-1907. She proved impossible to <b>refloat</b> and was destroyed in place.|$|E

50|$|On 7 April 1929, Paris ran aground in New York Harbor; she was <b>refloated</b> 36 hours later. On 18 April 1929, she ran aground again, {{this time}} on the Eddystone Rocks, Cornwall, United Kingdom. She was <b>refloated</b> two hours later, then {{anchored}} off Penlee, Cornwall, where 157 of her passengers were taken off by a tender and landed at Plymouth, Devon. She was severely damaged by fire at Le Havre, Seine-Maritime, France, on 20 August 1929 and sank, but was <b>refloated</b> on 11 September 1929, was repaired, and returned to service.|$|R

5|$|The attack caused little direct damage, but in {{the narrow}} waters of the channel the fireships panicked the sailors of the French fleet and most of their ships {{grounded}} and were left immobile. Cochrane expected Gambier to follow his attack with the main fleet, which could then destroy the vulnerable French force, but Gambier refused. Cochrane continued {{the battle over the}} next several days, successfully destroying several French ships, but with little support from Gambier. This allowed most of the French fleet to <b>refloat</b> and retreat up the Charente to safety. Gambier recalled Cochrane on 14 April and sent him back to Britain, withdrawing most of the inshore squadron at the same time, although scattered fighting continued until 25 April. The increasingly marginalised French fleet was badly damaged and trapped in its home ports; several captains were court-martialed for cowardice and one was shot.|$|E
5|$|While Lowestoffe was sailing {{through the}} Caicos passage late on 10 August, Pamplin {{realised}} that the strong currents known {{to run through}} the channel had reversed direction and Lowestoffe was running into shallow waters. He attempted to avoid grounding, but to no avail, and the Lowestoffe ran broadside onto Little Inagua (“Heneaga”) Island. The crew threw stores and equipment overboard to lighten the ship, and boats came from other ships in the convoy to try to pull her off. The attempts to <b>refloat</b> her failed and her crew abandoned her by mid-afternoon. The only casualties were five men who drowned when their boat capsized in the surf. The change in currents also caused the wreck of five merchantmen. In the late afternoon of 11 August Acasta left Bonetta and three of her own boats to help the wrecked vessels and then took command of the convoy.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish Navy hired two salvage {{companies}} to <b>refloat</b> the battleship, but both declined after they surveyed the wreck. Unable to raise her, the Spanish decided to remove as much weight {{as possible from}} España {{in an attempt to}} lighten her to permit refloating. Her guns were removed and dropped overboard to be picked up later by the salvage vessel Kanguro. The battleship's armor, machinery, and ammunition stores were also removed to lighten her. Her hull was then sealed and partially drained in preparation for raising, but while waiting for the necessary equipment from Italy, several violent storms hit the ship and caused further damage. The battered hull could now no longer be raised, and in November 1924, she broke in half and was abandoned by the Spanish Navy. The 305mm and 102mm guns recovered from España were installed in coastal batteries, some of which remained in service until 1999 before they were retired from service. After the overthrow of King Alfonso XIII, his namesake ship Alfonso XIII, was renamed España in April 1931.|$|E
