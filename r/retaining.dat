40|$|A {{study of}} the {{computer}} stored records of 293 dairy cows and 652 calvings reveals the effects of <b>retained</b> placenta and metritis complex on reproductive performance.

40|$|Aims and Objective: To {{find out}} and compare peri implant strain {{developed}} in four {{different types of}} implant supported prostheses i. e., cement <b>retained</b> splinted, cement <b>retained</b> non splinted, screw <b>retained</b> splinted, screw <b>retained</b> non splinted. Methodology: Four implant analogues were placed in a polyurethane mandibular model at the position of left and right first and second molar. Abutments were fixed to the implant at a torque of 25 Ncm. Two such models were made. Four different prostheses were placed on abutment of each model i. e screw <b>retained</b> splinted, screw <b>retained</b> nonsplinted, cement <b>retained</b> splinted, cement <b>retained</b> non splinted. Four strain gauges were attached on the model, two on the buccal and two on the lingual aspect of each implant. Static load of 400 N was applied on the prosthesis using universal testing machine. Load application was done ten times for each model and peri implant strain was measured. Results: The mean peri implant strain (±SD) generated {{was found to be}} highest in non-splinted screw <b>retained</b> (1397. 70 ± 44. 47 microstrains and 1265. 90 ± 42. 76 microstrains) and least in splinted cement <b>retained</b> (630. 70 ± 31. 98 microstrains and 519. 60 ± 32. 48 microstrains) in both 1 st and 2 nd molars respectively. Conclusions: Splinted crowns produce less peri implant strain when compared to non splinted crowns. Cement <b>retained</b> prosthesis produce less peri implant strain when compared to screw <b>retained</b> prosthesis. Least strain was observed in cement <b>retained</b> splinted crowns...|$|R

Incidence of <b>retained</b> placenta was studied in 495 parturitions. As possible risk factors for <b>retained</b> placenta, serum calcium, magnesium (n = 155), and vitamin-E concentrations, and glutathion peroxidase activity in blood (n= 99) were determined within 12 hours post partum and compared between mares with and without <b>retained</b> placenta.

As therapy, the relative effectiveness of intra venous administration of oxytocin in saline solution (n= 59) and of oxytocin in a Ca-Mg-borogluconate solution (n= 53) was studied. Parameters for post partum reproductive performance were compared between mares with (n= 54) and without <b>retained</b> placenta (n= 50), and within the group of mares with <b>retained</b> placenta, of mares from which the fetal membranes had been removed manually (n= 30) and from which it was not (n= 24).

40|$|Abstract. Industrial {{low alloy}} TRIP sheet steels contain blocky and lath-shaped <b>retained</b> austenite. In the present study, {{transformation}} behaviour of blocky and lath-shaped <b>retained</b> austenite during straining was investigated to clarify {{its effect on}} mechanical properties. Two types of TRIP steels containing almost the same amount but the different morphology of <b>retained</b> austenite were used. A steel containing large amount of lath-shaped <b>retained</b> austenite exhibits superior ductility, and sustains high work-hardenability in a high strain region. On the contrast, a steel containing large amount of blocky <b>retained</b> austenite exhibits low ductility. The work-hardenability increased steeply to the maximum at a low strain region, and then reduced in a high strain region. The stability of the blocky austenite {{has been found to}} be poor with respected to martensite transformation. The lath-shaped <b>retained</b> austenite remains until a high strain region whereas the blocky <b>retained</b> austenite transformed into martensite in a low strain region. Carbon content was higher in the lath-shaped <b>retained</b> austenite than in the blocky <b>retained</b> austenite. Stability of <b>retained</b> austenite is, however, inexplicable only by the carbon content, and would be affected by the different morphology and the resulting restraint conditions...|$|R
