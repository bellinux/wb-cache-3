However, the details of the power generation mechanisms are not understood well yet. In this paper, we are presenting a comparative study of luminosity-distance estimations for the complete sample of active galaxies observed by IUE satellite by different methods. IUE has made UV spectroscopic observations of nearly 400 active galaxies comprising mostly Seyfert 1 galaxies and quasars.

40|$|Various {{classical}} {{models of}} electrons including their spin {{degrees of freedom}} are commonly applied to describe the electron dynamics in strong electromagnetic fields. We demonstrate that different models can lead to different or even contradicting predictions regarding how the spin degree of freedom modifies the electron's orbital motion when the electron moves in strong electromagnetic fields. This discrepancy {{is rooted in the}} model-specific energy dependency of the spin-induced Stern-Gerlach force acting on the electron. The Frenkel model and the classical Foldy-Wouthuysen model are compared exemplarily in the nonrelativistic and the <b>relativistic</b> <b>limits</b> in order to identify parameter regimes where these classical models make different predictions. This allows for experimental tests of these models. In ultrastrong laser setups in parameter regimes where effects of the Stern-Gerlach force become relevant, radiation-reaction effects are also expected to set in. We incorporate the radiation reaction classically via the Landau-Lifshitz equation and demonstrate that although radiation-reaction effects can {{have a significant effect on}} the electron trajectory, the Frenkel model and the classical Foldy-Wouthuysen model remain distinguishable also if radiation-reaction effects are taken into account.

40|$|When {{speaking}} of unsolved problems in physics, this is surprising {{at first glance}} to discuss the case of fluid mechanics. However, there are many deep open questions {{that come with the}} theory of fluid mechanics. In this paper, we discuss some of them that we classify in two categories, the long term behavior of solutions of equations of hydrodynamics and the definition of initial (boundary) conditions. The first set of questions come with the non-relativistic theory based on the Navier-Stokes equations. Starting from smooth initial conditions, the purpose is to understand if solutions of Navier-Stokes equations remain smooth with the time evolution. Existence for just a finite time would imply the evolution of finite time singularities, which would have a major influence on the development of turbulent phenomena. The second set of questions come with the relativistic theory of hydrodynamics. There is an accumulating evidence that this theory may be relevant for the description of the medium created in high energy heavy-ion collisions. However, this is not clear that the fundamental hypotheses of hydrodynamics are valid in this context. Also, the determination of initial conditions remains questionable. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore some ideas related to these questions, both in the non-relativistic and <b>relativistic</b> <b>limits</b> of fluid mechanics. We believe that these ideas do not concern only the theory side but can also be useful for interpreting results from experimental measurements. Comment: 24 page...|$|R
