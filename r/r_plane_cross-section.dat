40|$|A finite element, large {{displacement}} {{formulation of}} static elastic-plastic analysis of slender arbitrarily curved planar beams is presented. Non-conservative and dynamic loads are sit present not included. The Bernoulli hypothesis of <b>plane</b> <b>cross-sections</b> is assumed {{and the effect}} of hear strains is neglected. Exact non-linear kinematic equations of curved beams, derived by Reissner are incorporated into;a generalized principle of virtual work through Lagrangian multipliers. The only function that has to be interpolated in the finite element implementation is the rotation of the centroid axis of a beam. This is an important advantage over other classical displacement approaches since the field consistency problem and related locking phenomena do not arise. Numerical examples, comprising elastic and elastic-plastic, curved and straight beams, at large displacements and rotations, show very nice computational and accuracy characteristics of the present family of finite elements. The comparisons with other published results very clearly show the superior performance of the present elements. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The study aims {{to prove the}} effectiveness of the proposed strengthening technique and detect the efficiency of different numbers of steel collars. Additionally, the effect of eccentric loading is investigated. This paper proves that an analytical expression available in the previous literature can be modified to provide the strength of the equivalent homogeneous cross section in simple compression. To this aim, the biaxial strength domain of the bricks is modified to account for the lateral pressure exerted by the steel collars. Moreover, based on the <b>plane</b> <b>cross-section</b> assumption, moment-axial force domains are derived using mechanical parameters that are experimentally determined for the units, the steel collars, and the masonry under centered compression. Finally, the capacity of these domains to give accurate results in relation to the confinement effect produced by the proposed strengthening technique is discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve the {{mechanical}} performance of timber beams, five rectangular-section beams were used in flexural test and ten for shearing. The effects of FRP types i. e.

The failure pattern, load-deflection curve, strain distribution and ultimate load capacity of the specimens were analyzed. The {{results indicate that the}} ultimate load carrying capacity of beams were increased by 15. 4 % to 55. 1 % varyingly with the reinforcement of FRP, besides, the stiffness and ductility were improved also. The improvements were lower in the specimens with material defects such as the existence of knags and shrink cracks. It’s more effective to paste the FRP sheets slantingly with the angle of 45 ° than vertically. However, the effect on the initial stiffness is not distinct whether reinforced or not. The analysis of strain and stress distribution manifests that the <b>plane</b> <b>cross-section</b> assumption is efficient in design and calculation of FRP reinforced timber beam...|$|R
