40|$|Who {{can refer}} a {{question}} on the interpretation and validity of EU law to the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) ? The most evident answer is a <b>court</b> <b>or</b> <b>tribunal</b> from a Member State, as it is established in the EU Treaties. The CJEU has developed a European concept of a <b>court</b> <b>or</b> <b>tribunal</b> through case law, but the EU Member States have diverse legal systems {{and there is no}} uniformity on the consideration of some bodies as a <b>court</b> <b>or</b> <b>tribunal.</b> Furthermore, the CJEU has had some problems with the interpretation of what a <b>court</b> <b>or</b> <b>tribunal</b> is, has added new criteria and has departed from some positions. On top of that, the EU has been growing and each enlargement has brought and will bring countries with more diverse legal systems. Because of that, the case law of the CJEU should be firm in order to avoid legal uncertainty aboutwho is truly empowered to use the procedure.

The majority of states are dualist, i.e. they will only accept international obligations through the process of incorporation, say by signing and adopting treaties and conventions. Hence, whether a supranational <b>court</b> <b>or</b> <b>tribunal</b> will have jurisdiction and, if so, over what subject matter and over what period of time, will be decided by the sovereign government of the day.|$|R
