50|$|The {{scutching}} knife is scraped {{down with}} a sharp strike against the fibers while they hang vertically. The edge of the knife is scraped along the fibers to pull away pieces of the stalk. This is repeated until all of the stalk has been removed and the flax is smooth and silky. When scutching was done by hand people could scutch up to 15 lb of flax in one day, though the amount depended {{on the quality of}} the flax. Coarser flax, harder flax and poorly <b>retted</b> <b>flax</b> takes longer to scutch. Retting removes the pectins that bind the fibers to the stalk and each other, so under-retted flax is harder to separate from the stalk, and often gets damaged in the scutching process.

50|$|Several {{methods are}} used for <b>retting</b> <b>flax.</b> It can be retted in a pond, stream, field, or tank. When the retting is complete, the bundles of flax feel soft and slimy, and quite a few fibers are {{standing}} out from the stalks. When wrapped around a finger, the inner woody part springs away from the fibers. Pond retting is the fastest. It consists of placing the flax {{in a pool of}} water which will not evaporate. It generally takes place in a shallow pool which will warm up dramatically in the sun; the process may take from a few days to a few weeks. Pond-retted flax is traditionally considered of lower quality, possibly because the product can become dirty, and is easily over-retted, damaging the fiber. This form of retting also produces quite an odor. Stream retting is similar to pool <b>retting,</b> but the <b>flax</b> is submerged in bundles in a stream or river. This generally takes two or three weeks longer than pond retting, but the end product is less likely to be dirty, does not smell as bad, and because the water is cooler, is less likely to be over-retted.

40|$|AbstractThe {{process of}} <b>retting</b> <b>flax</b> {{produces}} {{a huge amount}} of wastewater which is characterized with bad unpleasant smell and high concentration of organic materials. Treatment of such waste had always been difficult {{because of the presence of}} refractory organic pollutants such as lignin. In this study, treatment of retting wastewater was carried out using combined system of Fenton oxidation process followed by adsorption on granular activated carbon (GAC). The effects of operating condition on Fenton oxidation process such as hydrogen peroxide and iron concentration were investigated. In addition, kinetic study of the adsorption process was elaborated. The obtained results indicated that degradation of organic matters follows a pseudo-first order reaction with regression coefficient of 0. 98. The kinetic model suggested that the rate of reaction was highly affected by the concentration of hydrogen peroxide. Moreover, the results indicated that the treatment module was very efficient in removing the organic and inorganic pollutants. The average percentage removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solid (TSS), oil, and grease was 98. 60 %, 86. 60 %, and 94. 22 % with residual values of 44, 20, and 5 mg/L, respectively.

Painvise comparisons show that lower enzyme concentrations (0. 05 % v/v as commercially supplied) produce redder and yellower fiber samples than those retted with higher (0. 3 % v/v) enzyme levels. Higher chelator levels, (i. e., 50 versus 25 mmol ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) produce redder fibers. Fiber lightness significantly increases with additional cleaning steps.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} a {{detailed}} Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) for flax cultivation in Northern France. Nitrogen related field emissions are derived both from a process-oriented DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) method and the generic Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method. Since the IPCC method is synthesised from field measurements at sites with various soil types, climate conditions, and crops, it contains significant uncertainties. In contrast, the outputs from the DNDC method are considered as more site specific as it is built according to complex models of soil science. As it is demonstrated in this paper the emission factors from the DNDC method and the recommended values from the IPCC method exhibit significant variations for the case of flax cultivation. The DNDC based emission factor for direct N 2 O emission, which is a strong greenhouse gas, is 0. 25 - 0. 5 %, {{significantly lower than the}} recommend 1 % level derived from the IPCC method. The DNDC method leads to a reduction of 17 % in the impact category of climate change per kg <b>retted</b> <b>flax</b> straw production from the level obtained from the IPCC method. Much higher reductions are recorded for particulate matter formation, terrestrial acidification, and marine eutrophication impact categories. Meanwhile, based on the DNDC and IPCC methods, a comparative LCA per kg flax straw is presented. For both methods sensitivity analysis as well as comparison of uncertainties parameterisation of the N 2 O estimates via Monte-Carlo analysis are performed.

40|$|The {{development}} of polymers including the {{renewable raw materials}} starch and flax is subdivided into two main emphasis. The first emphasis describes the {{development of}} polymer blends based on numerous different kinds of thermoplastic starch (TPS) combined with both matrix systems of polypropylene and poly-#epsilon#-caprolactone. The compounding of blend materials is realized by means of co-rotating, close intermeshing twin screw extruders. Functional relations between melt rheology, material compositions, process parameters, morphology and mechanical blend properties will be worked out basically. The results clearly show that the morphology formation can't be exactly described with models of conventional synthetic polymers. Instead, the criteria concerning drop breakup and phase inversion must be modified due to the distinctive elastic melt properties of thermoplastic starch. Furthermore, within extensive climate test series will be examined, to what extent it can be managed with the matrix systems to protect the microdisperse incorporated TPS phase from direct influence of humidity and temperature so that these materials have a long time stability in physical and mechanical properties. The second emphasis is optimizing the mechanical properties of fibre composite materials composed of dew <b>retted</b> <b>flax</b> and a polypropylene matrix. To enhance the fibre/matrix interactions, various maleic anhydride based adhesion systems have been tested. The best results will be achieved by a direct reactive modification of polypropylene with maleic anhydride (MAH). The MAH grafting {{as well as the}} incorporation of natural fibres into the melted polypropylene is implemented by a co-rotating, close intermeshing twin screw extruder. The result of fibre incorporation with conventional screw elements like kneading blocks or turbine mixing elements turns out that no satisfied fibre dispersion could be obtained without having a drastic reduce in fibre length. Only with newly developed special comb elements a gentle fibre dispersion culminating elementary fibre structures can be generated to reach its maximum strength as well as impact toughness. The final challenge in process technology is to integrate separated preliminary steps of MAH-grafting, fibre incorporation and shaping in a single step compounding/press as well as compounding/injection moulding procedure.

40|$|Bast fibrous {{renewable}} materials, {{as commercial}} crops for {{the manufacture of}} textile based and other products, {{have been used for}} thousands of years to satisfy certain human needs, such as for shelter, clothing, source of energy and tools, and to sustain the livelihood of many communities in countries, such as in Asia, Europe and Africa. Concern for the environment has led to a number of global initiatives that favour the use of natural fibres. It is forecast that the global fibre demand by 2050 will be 130 million tonnes, which the cotton and synthetic fibre production {{will not be able to}} meet. Other than the environmental concerns, the renewed global interest in natural fibres, such as flax and hemp, forms part of a strategy to satisfy the fibre demand. South Africa, notwithstanding the fact that the flax and hemp industries have long been established for thousands of years in Europe, Asia and Egypt (Africa), has no history of the breeding, growing, processing and production of these cash crops. The renewed global interest in these crops has also stimulated interest from South Africa with respect to the development of a flax and hemp fibre industry so as to address some of the socio-economic challenges confronting the country today in its attempts to bring about real development in the rural areas through the cultivation and complete beneficiation of these fibre crops. In this regard, the relevant stakeholders, namely government, research councils, tertiary education institutions, farmers and communities worked together to investigate whether South Africa has the agronomic and climatic conditions, technical expertise as well as the necessary processing and production infrastructure to support the development of a local flax and hemp agro-industry. The purpose of this study was firstly to evaluate the performance of EU flax and hemp cultivars grown under different agronomic conditions in South Africa, and their effect on straw biomass yield, fibre yield and total fibre yield per hectare as well as associated fibre properties, and secondly to undertake mechanical fibre modification trials aimed at producing flax and hemp fibres with fibre diameters close to those of cotton. The minimum fibre diameter targeted being 20 μm. In accordance with the project objectives and work plan, selected dew <b>retted</b> <b>flax</b> and hemp straw samples from the various planting sites selected by the Agriculture Research Council – Institute for Industrial Crops, representing all the agronomic conditions under investigation, were taken to the CSIR for fibre extraction and testing. A relatively inexpensive and easy to operate Russian designed and manufactured machine, the CMT- 200 M breaker-cum-scutcher, was used for fibre extraction and the resultant extracted fibre bundles were further refined, using a steel comb, to obtain optimal fibre separation before their physical and chemical properties were evaluated. Results obtained in this research study proved that the climatic and agronomic conditions in South Africa were suitable for the cultivation of flax and hemp, notwithstanding the fact that the fibre yields achieved for hemp were lower than the minimum criteria of 23 percent, and that for flax only just exceeded the 25 percent minimum. The lack of local technical expertise on the growing and retting of flax and hemp, contributed to the low fibre yields. The planting parameters which were found to produce good results for the cultivation of hemp were the October planting date, using a row spacing of between 12. 5 to 25 cm, with a seeding density of between 80 – 100 kg, and the application of 50 – 100 kg nitrogen fertiliser. The use of extra artificial lighting and herbicide treatment did not appear to beneficially improve the hemp fibre yields.

40|$|Today, global {{environmental}} issues, such as {{global warming and}} fossil depletion, drive a paradigm shift in material applications from conventional fossil sources to renewable sources. Following this trend, the topic of this thesis is to analyse the use of biobased resources for fibre reinforced composite fabrication. Currently {{the most widely used}} fibre reinforced composites are composed of glass fibre reinforcements and polymeric matrices. In this thesis, the biobased alternative, i. e. flax fibre, {{which is one of the}} most widely used natural fibres, is studied as a glass fibre substitute from an environmental impact point of view. Moreover, a newly emerging biobased polymer, the wheat gluten, is analysed in the study; and it is compared to a conventional polymer and to a commercially available biobased polymer from environmental impact perspective. The main question addressed in this thesis is whether there are general environmental advantages for the use of flax fibres over glass fibres, and for the wheat gluten polymer over petrochemical polymers. Although biobased materials are often perceived to be environmentally friendly, an in-depth analysis is still needed to answer this question. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is considered to be an appropriate tool for environmental impact quantification. The thesis addresses the following research objectives: (i) to deliver life cycle inventory data for the flax fibre and wheat gluten; (ii) to perform LCA studies on flax fibres compared to glass fibres in composite reinforcement applications and on wheat gluten polymer compared to the conventional low density polyethylene (LDPE) and commercially available biobased polymer polylactic acid (PLA); (iii) to conduct an in-depth analysis concerning sensitivity and uncertainty to obtain information on the robustness of the obtained results. As the initial step, a detailed life cycle inventory for flax cultivation in Northern France is documented. Field emissions associated with the nitrogen cycle are estimated both from a process-oriented DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) method and the generic Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method. Since the IPCC method is derived from field measurements at sites with various soil types, climate conditions, and crops, it is subject to relatively large uncertainty. In contrast, the outputs from the DNDC method are believed to be more accurate because this method is constructed based on complex biochemical models from soil science and makes use of site specific data. The comparison of the results lead to the conclusion that the emission factors from the DNDC method and the recommended values from the IPCC method for flax cultivation in Northern France are quite different. The DNDC based emission factor for direct N 2 O emission, which is a strong greenhouse gas, is by a quarter to half lower than the recommended emission factor according to the IPCC method. The DNDC method leads to a reduction of 17 % in the impact category of climate change per kg <b>retted</b> <b>flax</b> straw production in comparison to the level obtained from the IPCC method. Different co-product accounting principles: mass allocation, economic allocation, and system expansion are investigated for the flax fibre extraction process. The impact results per kg flax hackled long fibre show that economic allocation and system expansion lead to similar values, while the mass allocation approach leads to significantly lower values among all impact categories. Furthermore, methods including the statistical fitting, qualitative judgement, and expert-judgement are integrated to parameterise the important inventory data to run a Monte-Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis. In the case of the climate change impact category, the uncertainty levels through the mass allocation, economic allocation, and system expansion are compared for the results. It is found that the system expansion approach implies the highest level of uncertainty due to inclusion of additional external processes, while the mass allocation leads to the lowest uncertainty. The uncertainty level related to economic allocation is significantly higher than the mass allocation, which can be caused by fluctuating prices of flax (co-) products. With a reliable impact assessment on flax fibre production and with the economic allocation method is used, the study further extends to a comparison of flax fibres and glass fibres in composite applications. The Ashby method is used to ensure functionally equivalent designs. A so-called life cycle environmental impact indicator (LEI) has been introduced. Such LEI is derived from the material mass indices illustrated in the Ashy method. The material mass indices contain only material intrinsic properties and are proportional to the product mass while ensuring equal functionality (e. g. stiffness, strength, etc.) for a specified structure and loading type. Then the LEI can be constructed by using unit environmental impact values (e. g. climate change, fossil depletion, and etc.) in production, use, and EoL, and multiplying these with the mass indices. The LEI highlights three important variables severely influencing the outcome of comparative studies based on this indicator method: the replacement ratio, the specific fuel saving (in case of transport applications), and the fibre volume fraction. The first parameter addresses the concern that flax FRPs are likely to fail earlier than conventional FRPs. Therefore, more flax FRP components are needed for the expected lifespan. The specific fuel saving denotes how much fuel can be saved by a certain weight reduction over a total transport distance. Since flax fibres have a much lower density than conventional glass fibres, flax FRPs can facilitate structures with reduced weight. Therefore flax FPRs are likely to contribute to lower fuel consumption rates. The third parameter, the flax volume fraction, influences the mechanical properties of flax FRPs. Constructed on the polypropylene (PP) matrix, two types of flax FRP products: the flax mat-PP (panel) and short flax fibre-PP (strut), produced via compression moulding and injection moulding, respectively, have been evaluated for multiple impact categories using the ReCiPe method for fixed values of the fibre volume fraction and specific fuel reduction. Compared to a 9 kg glass mat-PP with 20 vol% fibre content, with the equal stiffness criterion under bending, the flax mat-PP with 20 vol% leads to a reduced mass design (7. 8 kg). In contrast, with an equal stiffness criterion under tension, the short flax fibre-PP is similarily heavy (9. 2 kg) as the corresponding GFRP (9 kg). The LCA study compared the environmental impact of flax FRPs and GFRPs within Europe in non-transport use (production plus EoL phases) and transport use. Over the production and EoL phases, the flax mat-PP exhibits lower values for most environmental impact categories than its corresponding glass fibre based counterpart. For most categories, the reductions can reach 20 %~ 50 %. In particular, a 23 % reduction in the climate change category and a 24 % reduction in fossil depletion are documented. Moreover, for the impact categories of ozone depletion and human toxicity reductions of up to 70 % can be achieved. On the other hand, replacing the short glass fibre-PP by short flax fibre-PP only results in modest environmental impact reductions in multiple impact categories, including the impact categories of climate change and fossil depletion where only reductions of around 10 % are recorded. Coming to the full life cycle impact, the saved fuel consumption during the use phase could be very significant depending on the lifetime distance travelled. In 14 out of 17 impact categories, lower life cycle impact results can be observed for the flax mat-PP. However, in case of the short flax fibre-PP compared to short glass fibre-PP, the two material systems lead to very similar environmental impact values in multiple categories due to their very similar mass. Subsequently, a consequential life cycle analysis (CLCA) is conducted to capture how overall environmental impact will change when shifting from glass fibres to flax fibres as reinforcements in composite fabrication. With certain assumptions, the marginal flax fibre supply is identified to be a combination of Chinese flax fibre (70 %) and French flax fibre (30 %). Due to inferior cultivars and coal-fired electricity in Chinese flax cultivation, the CLCA study reveals that flax mat-PP has 0. 8 ~ 2 times higher environmental impact values than the glass mat-PP in most environmental impact categories over the production and end-of-life (EoL) phases. For the purpose of providing potential trajectories of marginal flax fibre supply, additional all French fibre, and all Chinese fibre scenarios are also evaluated, formulating the lower and upper boundaries in terms of environmental impact change, respectively. The attributional fibre supply mix scenario is supplied as well. The all French fibre scenario leads to better scores than glass fibre composites in most impact categories; while the break-even mix lies at attributional supply mix scenario since it presents a close eco-profile to that of glass mat-PP. All of these scenarios are useful for policy analysis. Finally, the study quantifies the life cycle impact for wheat gluten based materials. The contribution serves as a base assessment which can feed into the evaluation of any future wheat-gluten based product. The study evaluates wheat gluten based packaging film and compares it with low density polyethylene LDPE and PLA film over the life cycle of these products. Scenarios including extrusion and casting for film production; incineration with energy recovery and composting for end-of-life treatments are evaluated. The comparison offers insight into the environmental benefits of using wheat gluten over conventional plastic film as well as its biobased alternative and identifies its optimal production and disposal methods. For wheat gluten production, the LCA results show that the impacts of the wheat cultivation and gluten drying phase are dominant in the majority of the impact categories in the ReCiPe midpoint assessment method. The LCA results also exhibit that the scenario with wheat gluten film produced by extrusion and incinerated to recover embodied energy is favourable from an environmental perspective. It offers great benefits in climate change and fossil depletion over LDPE film and in 14 impact categories over PLA film. Although wheat gluten film suffers from common problems for biobased materials (e. g. land occupation), the overall environmental performance indicates that wheat gluten represents a promising source for biobased polymer productionTABLE OF CONTENT TABLE OF CONTENT	I LIST OF FIGURES	V LIST OF TABLES	VII LIST OF ABRIVATIONS	IX ABSTRACT	XI SAMENVATTING	XIII CHAPTER 1 GENERAL INTRODUCTION	 1 1. 1.
