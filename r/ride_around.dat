5|$|Public {{transport}} in Kuala Lumpur and {{the rest}} of the Klang Valley covers a variety of transport modes such as bus, rail and taxi. Despite efforts to promote usage of public transport, utilisation rates are low as only 16 percent of the population used public transport in 2006. However, public transport utilisation is set to rise with the opening of 2 light metro (LRT) extension lines on 30 June 2016. Rail transport in Kuala Lumpur encompasses the light metro (LRT), monorail, commuter rail and Airport rail link. The LRT system has 2 lines namely, Kelana Jaya Line and Ampang Line, connecting many locations in the city with major suburbs in Greater Kuala Lumpur. The Monorail serves various key locations in the city centre whereas the KTM Komuter runs between the city and the suburbs. The main rapid transit hub is KL Sentral, which is an interchange station for the rail systems. KL Sentral is also a hub for intercity railway service namely KTM Intercity and KTM ETS. It provides rail services to as far as Singapore in the south, and Hat Yai, Thailand, in the north. The rail system in Kuala Lumpur is expanding fast with more train lines due for completion or in the pipeline. In December 2016, the 1st phase of Klang Valley Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Project, Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line was completed, the remaining phases of the line has been open in July 2017, providing a more efficient <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> Greater Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
25|$|Confederate cavalry forces under Stuart {{for this}} {{operation}} {{consisted of the}} three brigades he had taken on his <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> the Union Army (commanded by Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton, Brig. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee and Col. John Chambliss) and the brigade of Col. Albert G. Jenkins (under the command of Col. Milton J. Ferguson following Jenkins' wounding on July 2). Although these four brigades should have amounted to approximately 5,000 men, {{it is likely that}} only 3,430 men and 13 guns saw action that day. And following their nine-day <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> Maryland and Pennsylvania, they and their horses were weary and not in prime condition for battle.|$|E

25|$|In {{preparation}} for the forthcoming Battle of the Crater, Grant wanted Lee to dilute his forces in the Petersburg trenches by attracting them elsewhere. He ordered Hancock's II Corps and two divisions of Sheridan's Cavalry Corps to cross the river to Deep Bottom by pontoon bridge and advance against the Confederate capital. His plan called for Hancock to pin down the Confederates at Chaffin's Bluff and prevent reinforcements from opposing Sheridan's cavalry, which would attack Richmond if practicable. If not—a circumstance Grant considered more likely—Sheridan was ordered to <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> {{the city to the}} north and west and cut the Virginia Central Railroad, which was supplying Richmond from the Shenandoah Valley.|$|E

25|$|In March and April 1862, Cooke {{served as}} an unpaid {{volunteer}} aide for Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart. Cooke was a first cousin of General Stuart's wife, Flora Cooke Stuart. On May 19, 1862, he was formally commissioned as a lieutenant and officially joined Stuart's staff. Cooke participated in the Peninsula Campaign and Stuart's subsequent <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> the Union army of George B. McClellan, later writing {{a detailed description of}} the action. Cooke {{served as an}} ordnance officer until October 1863. Despite Stuart's secret dislike for Cooke personally, Stuart praised Cooke's service during the Peninsula Campaign and Seven Days' Battles and sought a promotion for him. Stuart was promoted to major general on July 25, 1862. On June 9, 1863, Cooke and other staff members were drawn into combat at the Battle of Brandy Station.|$|E
25|$|On the Confederate side, most of Maj. Gen. Stuart's cavalry {{division}} was {{absent from the}} battlefield until late on the second day. Possibly misunderstanding orders from Gen. Robert E. Lee, Stuart had taken his three best brigades of cavalry on a pointless <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> the right flank of the Union Army of the Potomac and {{had been out of}} touch with the main body of Lee's Army of Northern Virginia since June 24, depriving Lee of critical intelligence information and screening services. Stuart arrived from Carlisle at Lee's headquarters shortly after noon on July 2 and his exhausted brigades arrived that evening, too late to affect the planning or execution of the second day's battle. Hampton's brigade camped to the north, following a relatively minor clash with Union cavalry at Hunterstown that afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Grant {{ordered the}} II Corps of the Army of the Potomac, {{commanded}} by Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock, and two divisions of Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan's Cavalry Corps {{to cross the}} river to Deep Bottom by pontoon bridge and advance against the Confederate capital. A division of the X Corps (Army of the James), commanded by Brig. Gen. Robert S. Foster, had previously crossed on a second pontoon bridge just upstream to secure a bridgehead on the north bank of the river. Grant's plan called for Hancock to pin down the Confederates at Chaffin's Bluff and prevent reinforcements from opposing Sheridan's cavalry, which would attack Richmond if practicable. If not—a circumstance Grant considered more likely—Sheridan was ordered to <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> {{the city to the}} north and west and cut the Virginia Central Railroad, which was supplying Richmond from the Shenandoah Valley.|$|E

25|$|Cooke {{also participated}} in the Gettysburg Campaign with Stuart. Soon {{after the start of}} the Stuart's <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> the Union Army of the Potomac, Cooke was nearly shot or {{captured}} during the Battle of Fairfax Court House (June 1863). He was eating breakfast with two other staff officers and a courier at the home of a blacksmith while the blacksmith shoed their horses. The Confederate officers were about a half mile from the main body of Brig. Gen. Wade Hampton III's cavalry division when advance riders from the 11th Regiment New York Volunteer Cavalry rode by in pursuit of the advance guard of Hampton's division. The other three Confederates quickly fled toward their main body but Cooke was intent on finishing his breakfast and having his horse shoed. He barely escaped when a second group of Union riders became suspicious of the nature of activity at the farm and rode up to check.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with several}} {{returning}} items from previous games, {{such as the}} Super Leaf, Mega Mushroom, Propeller Box and Boomerang Flower, several items are introduced. The Super Bell gives players a Cat Suit, allowing them to run faster, perform unique attacks and climb up walls to reach new areas. A variation of the Super Bell, the Lucky Bell, allows the player to temporarily transform their character into a lucky cat statue that awards coins under certain conditions. Another new power-up are the Double Cherries, which make a clone of the player, allowing for more effective attacks and a higher chance of survival; the more Double Cherries the player uses, the more clones that appear. Players can also wear Cannon Boxes, which fire shots at enemies, Light Blocks, which can defeat ghosts and Goomba masks, which let them blend in with enemy Goombas. Players are also {{able to pick up}} various objects, such as bombs, baseballs and Piranha Plants, which can be used to defeat enemies or solve puzzles, and <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> in a Skating Shoe or on an aquatic dinosaur named Plessie.|$|E
25|$|When the Confederate {{infantry}} {{cleared the}} Potomac River, accompanied or eventually joined by three other cavalry brigades, Stuart proceeded to ride through {{and around the}} Union Army in northern Virginia and central Maryland in order to harass and delay their movement, capture a wagon train of supplies, damage some communication and railroad property and to gather intelligence. Stuart's ride, which he could have abandoned early to allow return of his force to close contact with Lee's army, risked putting Stuart out of a position to provide timely intelligence and cavalry support to Lee. This risk was exposed as Stuart encountered several delays along the way. One of those delays {{was caused by the}} attack of the small Union cavalry force from the 11th New York Cavalry against Stuart's force of 2,000 men at Fairfax Court House on June 27, 1863. One of the more audacious actions by a small force against a much larger one during the war, the battle not only delayed Stuart's ride but cost the Confederates the life of the 1st North Carolina Cavalry's promising young commanding officer, Major John H. Whitaker. Stuart did not arrive at Gettysburg until the afternoon of {{the second day of the}} battle on July 2, 1863. Stuart's overall delay engendered considerable contemporary and future criticism and controversy concerning the value and conduct of his <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> the Union Army and its possible negative effect on the Confederate Army's operations and performance at Gettysburg.|$|E

In chapter 10, the enthroned figure of High states that Dagr {{is the son}} of the couple of Dellingr of the Æsir and his wife Nótt ("night"). Dagr is {{described}} as [...] "as bright and beautiful as his father's people". Odin took Dagr and his mother Nótt, gave them each a chariot and a horse — Dagr receiving the horse Skinfaxi, whose mane illuminates all the sky and the earth — and placed them in the sky to <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> the earth every 24 hours.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, in a {{controversial}} move, Lee allowed J.E.B. Stuart {{to take a}} portion of the army's cavalry and <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> the east flank of the Union army. Lee's orders gave Stuart much latitude, and both generals share the blame for the long absence of Stuart's cavalry, {{as well as for the}} failure to assign a more active role to the cavalry left with the army. Stuart and his three best brigades were absent from the army during the crucial phase of the approach to Gettysburg and the first two days of battle. By June 29, Lee's army was strung out in an arc from Chambersburg ( [...] northwest of Gettysburg) to Carlisle ( [...] north of Gettysburg) to near Harrisburg and Wrightsville on the Susquehanna River.|$|E

However, when Laura arrives, her greeting is ambiguous. Upon arriving at Jerry's apartment Laura removes her shoes and some excess clothing to get comfortable, asks for wine, and turns down the light and asks if she can stay over a second night. As Jerry removes his own shoes and begins to grow confident, the phone rings for Laura. When Laura gets off the phone she tells Jerry: [...] "Never get engaged." [...] Jerry then realizes {{that he has no}} chance with Laura, but has already committed himself – and his one-bedroom apartment – to an entire weekend with her, including a five-hour sightseeing boat <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> Manhattan.|$|E

500|$|In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, Nótt {{is again}} personified. In chapter 10, the enthroned figure of High states that Nótt is the {{daughter}} of a jötunn from Jötunheimr by the name of [...] "Norfi or Narfi". Nótt is described as [...] "black and swarthy", and has had three marriages. Her first marriage was with Naglfari, and the two produced a son by the name of Auðr. Nótt's second marriage was to Annar, resulting in their daughter Jörð, the personified earth. Finally, Nótt marries the god Dellingr, and the couple have Dagr, who takes after his [...] "father's people" [...] in brightness and fairness.

500|$|... "Fearless" [...] is {{four minutes}} and one second in length. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian {{described}} the song's genre as a [...] "kind of orthodontically perfect pop rock". He {{said the most}} country part of the song was a lyric that referenced a [...] "one horse town". The song is set in common time and has a moderate tempo of 100 beats per minute. It is written in the key of F major and Swift's vocals span two octaves, from F3 to C5. It follows the chord progression FCGmB♭-C. Tom Ronald of Great American Country interpreted the song's message to be about [...] "taking courage on the dating circuit." [...] In a different perspective, Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine said the lyrics [...] "And I don't know why but with you / I'd dance in a storm in my best dress, fearless" [...] demonstrated how Swift enjoyed making a scene. He added {{that she would not}} wear [...] "anything else to go <b>ride</b> <b>around</b> in a storm".|$|E

The release garnered higher critical acclaim than Starting Over, with Thom Owens of Allmusic calling the album [...] "nevertheless an excellent reminder of her deep talents as a vocalist". MCA Nashville chairman Bruce Hinton told Billboard how pleased he was with McEntire's release, calling the album's ten tracks [...] "powerful" [...] and concluding by stating, [...] "There are so many writers and so many great songs in Nashville, and Reba has collected her disproportionate shareShe's country music's female artist of the 90's." [...] What If It's You peaked at No. 1 Top Country Albums and No. 15 on the Billboard 200, while also becoming her first album in three years to certify in multi-platinum sales, selling two million copies by 1999.
