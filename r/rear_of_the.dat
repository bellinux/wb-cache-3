5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its North American relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including North American tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the bones in the <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mandible and the dentary in the front, Tarbosaurus had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge {{on the surface of}} the angular, which articulated with a square process on the <b>rear</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dentary.|$|E

The gaster has a flat first tergite that does not cover the petiole, a flat fourth abdominal sternite.|$|E

5|$|Berkeley House on Piccadilly {{was named}} after John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton who had {{purchased}} its land, and that surrounding it, shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660.

50|$|As further {{vacancies}} occurred, the British {{flag officer}} would be posted {{to the same}} rank in higher squadrons.

When reaching <b>the</b> highest position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rank (<b>rear</b> admiral <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red), the flag officer would next be promoted to <b>the</b> rank <b>of</b> vice admiral, and begin again at the lowest coloured squadron (vice admiral <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blue). The process would continue again, until <b>the</b> vice admiral <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red was promoted to admiral <b>of</b> <b>the</b> blue. The highest possible rank was admiral <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red squadron, which was synonymous with admiral <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleet (originally this rank wore the same insignia as a regular admiral - a special insignia was first created in 1843).|$|R

40|$|DE 102009011305 A 1 UPAB: 20100925 NOVELTY - The method {{involves}} partially coating a <b>rear</b> side <b>of</b> a {{silicon wafer}} (2) with a dielectric layer, and micro-structuring the dielectric layer. Back surface fields (3) are diffused at <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wafer. A micro-structured surface region is doped on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wafer. Liquid jet is guided over {{a region of}} a wafer outer surface, which is locally heated up by a laser jet, where the liquid jet contains dopant. A metallic germinal layer is partially galvanically applied on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wafer, such that a contact is made on <b>the</b> <b>rear</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wafer. USE - Method for manufacturing a solar cell (claimed) i. e. rear side contact solar cell.
