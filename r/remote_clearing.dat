The retrieval algorithm {{is based on}} the DOAS technique and optimized settings have been used to determine glyoxal slant columns. The liquid water absorption is accounted for using a two-step DOAS approach, leading to a drastic improvement of the fit quality over <b>remote</b> <b>clear</b> water oceans. Air mass factors are calculated by means of look-up tables of weighting functions pre-calculated with the LIDORT v 3. 3 radiative transfer model and using a priori glyoxal vertical distributions provided by the IMAGESv 2 chemical transport model. The total error estimate comprises random and systematic errors associated to the DOAS fit, the air mass factor calculation and the cloud correction. The highest glyoxal {{vertical column}} densities are mainly observed in continental tropical regions, while the mid-latitude columns strongly depend on the season with maximum values during warm months. An anthropogenic signature is also observed in highly populated regions of Asia. Comparisons with glyoxal columns simulated with IMAGESv 2 in different regions of the world generally point to a missing glyoxal source, most probably of biogenic origin...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether and which aspects of a concurrent motor activity can facilitate children’s and adults’ performance in a dynamic imagery task. Children (5 -, 7 -, and 9 -year-olds) and adults were asked to tilt empty glasses, filled with varied amounts of imaginary water, so that the imagined water would reach the rim. Results showed that in a manual tilting task where glasses could be tilted actively with visual feedback, even 5 -year-olds performed well. However, in a blind tilting task and in a static judgment task, all age groups showed markedly lower performance. This implies that visual movement information facilitates imagery. In a task where the tilting movement was visible but regulated by means of an on-and-off <b>remote</b> control, a <b>clear</b> age trend was found, indicating that active motor control and motor feedback are particularly important in imagery performance of younger children...|$|R
50|$|Much of Pissarro’s {{work from}} the 1860s and early 1870s was {{characteristically}} light, airy and panoramic, such as his painting of 1864-5, The Banks of the Marne at Chennevières. With the Montfoucault works of the middle 1870s, Pissarro turned to explore a narrower theme of peasant rurality, and with the wooded sous bois (‘undergrowth’) landscapes of the late 1870s, this quest for intimacy further constricted and darkened. In spite of this aesthetic contraction, some of the sous bois paintings were quite large and The Côte des Bœufs at L’Hermitage is in fact one of Pissarro’s largest paintings. The densely treated surface, the extensive use of tone, the fragmented and overlaying strokes, and the theme of buildings seen through a screen of trees are all characteristic of {{his work at the}} end of the 1870s, and the abstractly and closely conceived internal rhythms are very <b>remote</b> from the <b>clear</b> air of the earlier pictures.|$|R

40|$|PRESAGE ® {{is a solid}} radiochromic {{dosimeter}} {{consisting of}} a polyurethane matrix, a triarylmethane leuco dye, and a trihalomethane initiator. Varying the composition and/or relative amounts of these constituents can affect the dose sensitivity, post-irradiation stability, and physical properties of the dosimeter. This allows customisation of PRESAGE ® to meet application-specific requirements, such as low sensitivity for high dose applications, stability for <b>remote</b> dosimetry, optical <b>clearing</b> for reusability, and tissue-like elasticity for deformable dosimetry. This study evaluates five hard, non-deformable PRESAGE ® formulations and six deformable PRESAGE® formulations and characterizes them for dose sensitivity and stability. Results demonstrated sensitivities {{in the range of}} 0. 0029 – 0. 0467 ΔOD/(Gy·cm) for hard formulations and 0. 0003 – 0. 0056 ΔOD/(Gy·cm) for deformable formulations. Exceptional stability was seen in both standard and low sensitivity non-deformable formulations, with promising applications for remote dosimetry. Deformable formulations exhibited potential for reusability with strong post-irradiation optical clearing. Tensile compression testing of the deformable formulations showed elastic response consistent with soft tissues, with further testing required for direct comparison. These results demonstrate that PRESAGE ® dosimeters have the flexibility to be adapted for a wide spectrum of clinical applications. 1...|$|R
40|$|DELICAT – Experiment part We {{report on}} the {{development}} of a long-range airborne UV lidar, intended for the <b>remote</b> detection of <b>clear</b> air turbulence (CAT). The detection of turbulence is based on the measurement of density fluctuations associated with the movement of turbulent air masses. These density fluctuations are measured by the variations in the molecular backscatter coefficient. Within the EC FP 7 project ‘DELICAT’ the experimental lidar system has been designed, built and integrated onto the Dutch research aircraft PH-LAB. In summer 2013, a flight campaign has been performed for validating the concept of lidar-based CAT detection. First results of the airborne measurements will be given in the talk. DELICAT - Meteorological Part The projects main objective is testing of detection of clear-air turbulence (CAT) by long the range UV lidar. The realization of this goal was assisted by some meteorological activities. The existing methods of CAT forecasting are not perfect and can not be readily used to create a good forecast. The meteological part was focused on assisting the flight test campaign to increase the CAT encounter chances. In this talk we will present an overview of those activities including the developement of new CAT detection algorithms based on numerical weather prediction model output...|$|R
40|$|The {{islands of}} French Polynesia cover {{an area the}} size of Europe, though total land area is smaller than Rhode Island. Each hot spot {{archipelago}} (Societies, Marquesas, Australs) is chronologically arranged. With the advent of molecular techniques, relatively precise estimations of timing and source of colonization have become feasible. We compile data for the region, first examining colonization (some lineages dispersed from the west, others from the east). Within archipelagos, blackflies (Simulium) provide the best example of adaptive radiation in the Societies, though a similar radiation occurs in weevils (Rhyncogonus). Both lineages indicate that Tahiti hosts the highest diversity. The more <b>remote</b> Marquesas show <b>clear</b> examples of adaptive radiation in birds, arthropods and snails. The Austral Islands, though generally depauperate, host astonishing diversity on the single island of Rapa, while lineages on other islands are generally widespread but with large genetic distances between islands. More recent human colonization has changed the face of Polynesian biogeography. Molecular markers highlight the rapidity of Polynesian human (plus commensal) migrations and the importance of admixture from other populations during the period of prehistoric human voyages.

See: [URL] Congestive heart failure is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in Australia. Accurate data for the Northern Territory and Indigenous Australians are not presently available. The economic burden of this chronic cardiovascular disease is felt by all funding bodies and it still remains unclear what impact current measures have on preventing the ongoing disease burden and how much of this filters down to more <b>remote</b> areas. <b>Clear</b> differentials also exist in rural areas including a larger Indigenous community, greater disease burden, differing aetiologies for heart failure as well as service and infrastructure discrepancies. It is becoming increasingly clear that urban solutions will not affect regional outcomes. To understand regional issues relevant to heart failure management, an understanding of the key performance indicators in that setting is critical. Methods and analysis The Northern Territory Heart Failure Initiative—Clinical Audit (NTHFI-CA) is a prospective registry of acute heart failure admissions over a 12 -month period across the two main Northern Territory tertiary hospitals. The study collects information across six domains and five dimensions of healthcare. The study aims to set in place an evidenced and reproducible audit system for heart failure and inform the developing heart failure disease management programme. The findings, is believed, will assist the development of solutions to narrow the outcomes divide between remote and urban Australia and between Indigenous and Non-Indigenous Australians, in case they exist. A combination of descriptive statistics and mixed effects modelling will be used to analyse the data. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by respective ethics committees of both the admitting institutions. All participants will be provided a written informed consent which will be completed prior to enrolment in the study. The study results will be disseminated through local and international health conferences and peer reviewed manuscripts...|$|R

Although the remote sensing {{technology has been}} widely employed on wetland investigation and identification, changeable weather conditions especially cloud interference are the main barrier to acquire <b>clear</b> <b>remote</b> sensing image for wetland identification and information extraction. The combination and precision evaluation of remote sensing data with high temporal-spatial resolution ratio from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat were conducted using the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM): a comprehensively temporal-spatial reflectance model was built; the high-resolution image in the time series and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index were obtained. The main data obstacles in wetland resources monitoring were invalid. The typical wetland areas in Liaoning province of China were evaluated using combination algorithm and Landsat (Thematic Mapper) images.

40|$|In {{addition}} to other {{measures such as}} energy saving, the adoption of microgeneration driven by renewable and low carbon energy resources {{is expected to have}} the potential to reduce losses associated with producing and delivering electricity, combat climate change and fuel poverty, and improve the overall system performance. However, incorporating a substantial volume of microgeneration within a system that is not designed for such a paradigm could lead to conflicts in the operating strategies of the new and existing centralised generation technologies. So it becomes vital for such substantial amount of microgeneration among other decentralised resources to be controlled in the way that local constraints are mitigated and their aggregated response supports the wider system. In addition, the characteristic behaviour of connected microgeneration requires to be understood under different system conditions to ascertain measures of risk and resilience, and to ensure the benefits of microgeneration to be delivered. Therefore, this thesis provides three main valuable contributions of future attainment of sustainable power systems. Firstly, a new conceptual control structure for a system incorporating a high penetration of microgeneration and dynamic load is developed. Secondly, the resilience level of the host distribution network as well as the resilience levels of microgeneration during large transient disturbances is evaluated and quantified. Thirdly, a technical solution that can support enhanced transient stability of a large penetration of LV connected microgeneration is introduced and demonstrated. A control system structure concept based on “a cell concept” is introduced to manage the spread of heavy volumes of distributed energy resources (DERs) including microgeneration such that the useful features of DER units in support of the wider system can be exploited, and the threats to system performance presented by significant connection of passive and unpredictable DERs can be mitigated. The structure also provides simpler and better coordinated communication with DERs by allowing the inputs from DERs and groups of cells to be transferred as collective actions when it moves from a local to a wider system level. The anticipated transient performance problems surrounding the integration of microgeneration on a large basis within a typical urban distribution network are addressed. Three areas of studies are tackled; the increased fault level due to the present of microgeneration, the collective impact of LV connected microgeneration on traditional LV protection performance, and the system fault ride through capabilities of LV connected microgeneration interfaced by different technologies. The possible local impacts of unnecessary disconnection of large amount of microgeneration on the performance of the host distribution network are also quantified. The thesis proposes a network solution based on using resistive-type superconducting fault current limiters (RSFCLs) to prevent the impact of local transient disturbances from expanding and enhance the fault ride through capabilities of a high penetration of microgeneration connected to low voltage distribution networks. A new mathematical approach is developed within the thesis to identify at which condition RSFCL {{can be used as a}} significant device to maintain the transient stability of large numbers of LV connected microgeneration. The approach is based on equation solution to determine the minimum required value of the resistive element of RSFCL to maintain microgeneration transient stability, and at the same time additional headroom against switchgear short-circuit ratings is provided. Remote disturbances or a failure to <b>clear</b> <b>remote</b> faults quickly are shown to no longer result in complete unnecessary disconnection of substantial amount of microgeneration...|$|R
