40|$|China, as {{the birthplace}} of several great inventions, is no {{stranger}} to creativity, and, indeed, innovation. That said, while the notion of copyright has for a long time been recognised as being essential to the protection of Chinese inventions, it is perhaps regrettable that the existing system of copyright protection in that country remains largely inefficacious, at least when compared to western countries, in terms of addressing the key challenges and complexities posed by the rapid developments that characterise the digital age. It is against this backdrop that this thesis has been conceptualised; the overarching aim, in this regard, being to assess the development and nature of copyright protection in China, from a comparative perspective, in an effort to unearth the challenges that arise in the digital age, and to proffer suggestions for reform in this <b>regard.</b> <b>More</b> <b>specifically,</b> through the adoption of the doctrinal, historical and comparative methodologies, this thesis examines the historical evolution of copyright protection in China, and argues that while there has been some progress in recent years in terms of copyright protection that commensurate with China's economic development and international obligations, a number of outstanding issues remain unresolved, especially with regard to striking the right balance between competing interests. The thesis also evaluates the role of emerging technologies, such as peer-to-peer technology, and argues that China has struggled to address many of these challenges associated therewith, notwithstanding the progressive approaches countenanced by other jurisdictions. The thesis argues that one of the main challenges that account for the existing inadequacy that characterises China's system of copyright protection is the country's very history and culture, which do not ascribe a high degree of primacy to the exclusive rights of copyright owners. History and culture, among other, mostly legal, factors, might also account for the currently high levels of uncertainty that characterise the construction of secondary liability in relation to ISPs in China. Apart from assessing the uncertainties associated with secondary liability, however, the thesis will also examine the complexities and challenges that surround the use of emerging technologies, such as technological protection measures, that aim to protect copyright in the digital era, and argues that while these challenges are real, they are not at all insurmountable. Against this backdrop, pragmatic solutions, drawing largely from other jurisdictions, are provided throughout this thesis. ...|$|R

For this reason, we turn to special cases for which perinormality descends from R[X] to R.

Once {{inserted into the}} membrane, hemi-channels (connexons) allow for diffusion of ions and small molecules (< 1 kDa) between the extracellular space and the cytosol.

As revealed by our detailed simulation study, the increased DoS resilience comes with increased overheads. While DoS resilience is extremely critical, reducing overheads in the resource-constrained wireless environment also assumes paramount importance.

A major figure of world literature, Cortázar’s fictions are known {{to break out of the}} prison of words and conventional practices. His “counternovel” Hopscotch (1963), a milestone in Latin American fiction writing, is nothing less than a linguistic revolution. Part of what makes this novel revolutionary is the way it explores the boundaries of language and reality. The other part are its profuse references to jazz music, making it a work of unparalleled sonority. In fact, the presence of music – jazz, classical music, and tango – is significant not only in this novel but also in at least in half of Cortázar’s tremendous production. Most scholarship about Cortázar agrees that the author uses music as an alternative form of expression, one that complements and contradicts traditional language.

50|$|In her piece “Race and the New Reproduction,” Dorothy E. Roberts {{outlines}} scientific developments <b>regarding</b> reproduction, <b>more</b> <b>specifically</b> {{focusing on}} {{in vitro fertilization}} or IVF as well as surrogate/contract pregnancies. Roberts notes that many feel that advancements {{in the field of}} reproduction work to provide new technologies that are beneficial to those desiring to become parents. Roberts argues that while these new advancements in reproductive technologies offer individuals who are shut out of reproducing without the aid of reproductive technology the opportunity to have children, they still ultimately conform to societal norms that are annexed onto family. Her evidence outlines that the majority of individuals who use and benefit from IVF or other forms of reproductive technologies tend to be heterosexual couples due to social, racial, cultural, economic, as well as legal implications. She argues then that the idea of the nuclear family consisting of a mother, father, and children remains intact due to who is accessing these resources. Roberts uses a feminist perspective to argue that patriarchal norms are invoked with new forms of reproductive technology, as married men strongly benefit from these practices, and that they continue to play into a hierarchy system in the United States that is categorized by race. Roberts finds that IVF is predominately used by white individuals and that legal cases and stories surrounding the mistaken use of sperm or eggs from black donors in IVF treatments are often highly sensationalized in the media. She notes that black individual’s lack of access to reproductive technologies is a reflection of issue of their lack of access to healthcare more generally. She additionally notes that sometimes black individual’s cultural norms, which stress the importance and significance of familial blood ties, which she argues is linked to a history of slavery and patriarchy, become barriers to accessing these types of technologies. Roberts concludes by noting the serious racial disparities that exist between black and white individuals in their efforts to use these reproductive technologies.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the perceptions that MBA students hold regarding family-owned businesses compared to non-family firms. The study {{is based on}} the assumption that attracting talent is critical not only for continuous competitive advantage, but also for the survival of family-owned businesses. Therefore, family-owned firms should promote themselves as equally attractive as non-family organizations in terms of employment opportunities. MBA graduates represent a rich pool of talent that can help family-owned firms to prosper across generations. One avenue of inquiry in this regard is to study MBA students and their perceptions. Consequently, studying whether MBA students hold a specific image regarding family-owned businesses is brought to the forefront. With this aim, the authors engaged in an enquiry process, dealing with MBA students' perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of family-owned firms compared to non-family businesses. The sample was composed of 213 MBA students from 20 different countries. The results showed that MBA students do indeed hold a particular image <b>regarding</b> family-owned firms. <b>More</b> <b>specifically,</b> some of the findings are that MBA students perceive family-owned firms as having more problems within the ownership than non-family businesses, are not as good as non-family firms in attracting talented managers, have less job rotation, are slower in their internationalization processes, are slower in the implementation of new technologies, have more difficulty in issuing equity and have a later retirement age than non-family firms.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{the notion of}} a one-sided random context grammar as a context-free-based regulated grammar, in which a set of permitting symbols and a set of forbidding symbols are attached to every rule, and its set of rules is divided into the set of left random context rules and the set of right random context rules. A left random context rule can rewrite a nonterminal if each of its permitting symbols occurs {{to the left of the}} rewritten symbol in the current sentential form while each of its forbidding symbols does not occur there. A right random context rule is applied analogically except that the symbols are examined to the right of the rewritten symbol. The thesis is divided into three parts. The first part gives a motivation behind introducing one-sided random context grammars and places all the covered material into the scientific context. Then, it gives an overview of formal language theory and some of its lesser-known areas that are needed to fully grasp some of the upcoming topics. The second part forms the heart of the thesis.
