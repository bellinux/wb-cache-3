40|$|Copyright © 2005 SAE International The {{equations}} of {{rotational motion}} {{used to calculate}} pre-impact vehicle speeds using the rotational displacement of the vehicles following a collision are well known. The technique uses the rotational momentum exchange during impact and the principle of conservation of rotational energy to calculate the post impact vehicle angular velocity from the energy dissipated during the vehicle’s rotation to a stop (product of torque and rotational displacement). Integral to the calculation of the stopping torque on the vehicle is {{the determination of the}} effective <b>rotational</b> coefficient of <b>friction</b> (fr) between the tires and the roadway. The interactions of the road with the tires to produce the <b>rotational</b> coefficient of <b>friction</b> (fr) are more complex and less understood than those of linear coefficient of friction (deceleration factor). A derivation of the post impact equations of motion and the kinematics of vehicles in rotation are examined. The resultant parameters of motion that affect the <b>rotational</b> coefficient of <b>friction</b> (fr) are presented. The effects of these various parameters on the <b>rotational</b> coefficient of <b>friction</b> (fr) were studied using EDSMACTM. Normalized coefficients, which can be multiplied by the roadway friction to obtain the <b>rotational</b> coefficient of <b>friction</b> (fr) under common accident scenarios, are presented.

50|$|The {{purpose of}} a ball bearing is to reduce <b>rotational</b> <b>friction</b> and support radial and axial loads. It {{achieves}} this by using at least two races to contain the balls and transmit the loads through the balls. In most applications, one race is stationary {{and the other is}} attached to the rotating assembly (e.g., a hub or shaft). As one of the bearing races rotates it causes the balls to rotate as well. Because the balls are rolling they have a much lower coefficient of friction than if two flat surfaces were sliding against each other.|$|E
50|$|Spin welding is a {{particular}} form of frictional welding. With this process, one component with a round weld joint is held stationary, while a mating component is rotated at high speed and pressed against the stationary component. The <b>rotational</b> <b>friction</b> between the two components generates heat. Once the joining surfaces reach a semi-molten state, the spinning component is stopped abruptly. Force on the two components is maintained until the weld joint cools and re-solidifies. This is a common way of producing low- and medium-duty plastic wheels, e.g., for toys, shopping carts, recycling bins, etc. This process {{is also used to}} weld various port openings into automotive under hood components.|$|E

This paper describes the design of a new experimental device intended to measure damping caused by friction and partial slip in rotational joints. An original method for measuring dissipated energy in rotational joints with plan-plan contact is proposed. This method is based on Lagrange formalism and allows to measure accurately forces and torques only with accelerometers. These techniques are available for very small displacements that occur in micro-slip and partial slip of surfaces in contact and are still available for large displacements (macro-slip). An analytical compact model based on the Greenwood model is studied. The experimental results and simulations used to quantify the dissipated energy in order to compute the damping ratio are presented and discussed...|$|R

The paper mainly deals with a side-transmission ball mill. The main fault is about the breakdown in the elastic rubber coupling of the transmission system. It is found {{from the analysis}} of the real cases and data that the actual power consumption is increased and it is caused by the overload. The main parameters which influence the ball mill power consumption are load of the mill, feed material mass, ball mill <b>rotational</b> speed and <b>friction.</b> The main part of power consumption for ball mill is used to elevating grinding body and material, a portion is used to overcome the friction force between the main bearing. Under the conditions in which the load of the mill and feed material mass are kept the same, the parameters which influence the ball mill power consumption are <b>rotational</b> speed and <b>friction</b> status. When the ball mill voltage decreased, according to the motor characteristics, its rotation speed will decrease, which will disrupt the hydrodynamic lubrication state of the hollow shaft and spherical surface, so that the power consumption of the ball mill increase.
