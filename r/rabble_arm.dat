5000|$|Puddled iron—the {{puddling}} process {{was the first}} large-scale process to produce wrought iron. In the {{puddling process}}, pig iron is refined in a reverberatory furnace to prevent harmful sulphur from the coal or coke from contaminating the iron. The molten pig iron is manually stirred and iron ore, an oxygen source, is added, which decarburizes the iron. As the iron is stirred, globs of wrought iron are collected into balls by the stirring rod (<b>rabble</b> <b>arm</b> or rod) and those are periodically removed by the puddler. Puddling was patented in 1784 and became widely used after 1800. By 1876, annual production of puddled iron in the UK alone was over 4 million tons. Around that time, the open hearth furnace was able to produce steel of suitable quality for structural purposes, and wrought iron production went into decline.|$|E
30|$|A 5.00 g coal sample, {{ground to}} pass a 425 μm sieve, was {{compacted}} around the <b>rabble</b> <b>arm</b> of a stirrer in a metal crucible {{with the help of}} the preparatory facility. The arm was linked to a motor that provides torque that rotates the stirrer in the compacted coal mass. At the onset, the torque was so small that the stirrer could not rotate when the coal mass was in the solid state. At a point, when the coal mass softened as a result of heat transfer from the lead bath and carbonization temperature increase, fluid was produced as recorded by the rotation of the stirrer which was conveyed via a sensor to the digital output unit, indicating the softening temperature (°C), resolidification temperature (°C), maximum fluidity temperature (°C) and maximum fluidity in dial division per minute (DDPM).|$|E

Those on our right had come from Frome and Radstock, {{in the north of}} Somersetshire, and were a mere <b>rabble</b> <b>armed</b> with flails, hammers, and other such weapons, with no common sign of order or cohesion save the green boughs which waved in their hat-bands. The body upon our left, who bore a banner amongst them announcing that they were men of Dorset, were fewer in number but better equipped, having a front rank, like our own, entirely armed with muskets.|$|R

Meeting this novel's narrator and his brother, Arundel men, she pretends never to have heard of the town and recasts for their benefit the late Guerlac as having been her father, whose property she has come to England to dispose of. Marie, however, and her new escort—her Canadian uncle Lanaudiere (AKA Mr. Leonard), another peripheral figure in British intelligence—are here to see Lord Germain (later Viscount Sackville).|$|R

50|$|The American {{commander}} at Cowpens was Brigadier General Daniel Morgan, one of {{the heroes}} of Roberts' earlier novels Arundel and <b>Rabble</b> in <b>Arms</b> as a key aide to Major General Benedict Arnold. Roberts wanted to challenge the historians that had written about the blunders of both Morgan and British Colonel Banastre Tarleton during the battle, but his physical condition wouldn't permit him to finish another novel. Instead, Roberts accepted a commission from Collier's to write an essay about the battle. Roberts, however, was displeased with the abridged version of the essay that was published and arranged to have the unedited version published, albeit posthumously.|$|R
5000|$|Tarkington {{was married}} to Louisa Fletcher from 1902 until their divorce in 1911. Their only child, Laurel, was born in 1906 and died in 1923. He married Susanah Keifer Robinson in 1912. They had no children. Tarkington began losing his {{eyesight}} in the 1920s and was blind in his later years. He continued producing his works by dictating to a secretary. Despite his failing eyesight, between 1928 and 1940 he edited several historical novels by his Kennebunkport, Maine neighbor Kenneth Roberts, who described Tarkington as a [...] "co-author" [...] of his later books and dedicated three of them (<b>Rabble</b> in <b>Arms,</b> Northwest Passage, and Oliver Wiswell) to him.|$|R
5000|$|The ducal army {{consisted}} of the [...] "Great Guard", 4,000 mercenaries from the Netherlands, commanded by a petty noble (Junker) named Thomas Slentz, 2,000 armoured cavaliers, about 1,000 artillery-men and 5,000 commoners. The defenders were about 1,000 men, all peasants. These men were a well-armed and well-organized militia, not the desperate, badly <b>armed</b> <b>rabble</b> one would associate with the term [...] "peasant army".|$|R
50|$|Booth Tarkington, a {{neighbor}} of Roberts in Kennebunkport, Maine, convinced {{him that he would}} never find the time to succeed as a novelist while he worked as a journalist, and Tarkington agreed to help by editing Roberts' early novels. Although Roberts continued to sell a few essays to the Post, his next few years were largely dedicated to historical fiction. Ultimately, Tarkington edited all of his historical novels through Oliver Wiswell (1940), and Roberts said in his autobiography that he offered Tarkington co-writing credit on both Northwest Passage and Oliver Wiswell due to Tarkington's extensive revisions to each. Both of those novels as well as <b>Rabble</b> in <b>Arms</b> are dedicated to Tarkington, and Tarkington continued to assist Roberts until his death in 1946.|$|R
50|$|Kenneth Lewis Roberts (December 8, 1885 - July 21, 1957) was an American {{author of}} {{historical}} novels. Roberts worked {{first as a}} journalist, becoming nationally known for his work with the Saturday Evening Post from 1919 to 1928, {{and then as a}} popular novelist. Born in Kennebunk, Maine, Roberts specialized in Regionalist historical fiction. He often wrote about his native state and its terrain, also depicting other upper New England states and scenes. For example, the main characters of Arundel and <b>Rabble</b> in <b>Arms</b> are from Kennebunkport (then called Arundel), the main character of Northwest Passage is depicted as being from Kittery, Maine with friends in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and the main character in Oliver Wiswell is from Milton, Massachusetts.|$|R
5000|$|Roberts {{wrote the}} novel in close {{collaboration}} with his neighbor Booth Tarkington, and dedicated the novel to him. In his autobiography, Roberts says that Tarkington did significantly more editing and rewriting {{of this book}} {{than he had ever}} done on any of Roberts' prior books, even <b>Rabble</b> in <b>Arms,</b> which had been Roberts' first real success. As a result, Roberts became discouraged during the writing process. When he worked up the courage to ask Tarkington whether his writing had become so much worse that the book needed so much more substantial editing, Tarkington told him that the opposite was true—the book was so much better than its predecessors that Tarkington thought it could become a smash hit with such editing. [...] Roberts offered Tarkington co-author credit, but Tarkington refused it.|$|R

He had not time to wonder at a sudden shout before he felt himself surrounded, not, in the first instance, by an unarmed <b>rabble,</b> but by <b>armed</b> Compagnacci; the next {{sensation}} was that his cap fell off, and that he was thrust violently forward amongst the rabble, along the narrow passage of the bridge. Then he distinguished the shouts, [...] "Piagnone! Medicean! Piagnone! Throw him over the bridge!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Pellew is {{featured}} as the Captain of [...] {{in some of}} C. S. Forester's fictional Horatio Hornblower novels. In the television adaptations, as portrayed by Robert Lindsay, he is given a more prominent role. As a midshipman, he appears in the novel Jack Absolute by Chris Humphreys. Pellew {{is the name of}} a minor character in several of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin novels, including The Reverse of the Medal, The Surgeon's Mate, but as himself is only mentioned in The Yellow Admiral and The Hundred Days. As a captain, he has a small role in the American Revolution in <b>Rabble</b> in <b>Arms,</b> an historical novel by Kenneth Roberts. He appears in Alexander Kent's Adam Bolitho novel, Relentless Pursuit, which partially relates to Pellew's expedition against the Barbary States. His service in the American Revolution is mentioned on page 354 of Diana Gabaldon's [...] "An Echo in the Bone", {{which is part of the}} Outlander series.|$|R
50|$|Roberts' {{historical}} fiction often focused on rehabilitating unpopular persons and causes in American history. A key character in Arundel and <b>Rabble</b> in <b>Arms</b> is American officer and eventual traitor Benedict Arnold, with Roberts focusing on Arnold's expedition to Quebec and the Battle of Quebec {{in the first}} novel and the Battle of Valcour Island, the Saratoga campaign and the Battles of Saratoga in the second. Meanwhile, the hero of Northwest Passage was Major Robert Rogers and his company Rogers' Rangers, although Rogers fought for the British during the American Revolutionary War. Oliver Wiswell focuses on a Loyalist officer during the American Revolution and covers the entire war, from famous {{events such as the}} Siege of Boston, the Battle of Bunker Hill, the New York and New Jersey campaign through the Battle of Fort Washington, and the Franco-American alliance, to less-remembered events such as the Convention Army, the exodus to Kentucky County, the Siege of Ninety-Six, and the resettlement of the United Empire Loyalists, as well as providing a later look at both a dissolute Rogers and a frustrated Arnold among the British.|$|R

Dartmouth surrendered on 18 January 1646, Hopton was defeated at the Battle of Torrington on 16 February, and surrendered the remnant of his worthless army on 14 March. Exeter fell on 13 April. Elsewhere, Hereford was taken on 17 December 1645, and the Battle of Stow-on-the-Wold, the last pitched battle of the war, was fought and lost by Lord Astley on 21 March 1646.|$|R

It was a hasty and risky exodus, and it was said that Hernandez, occupying with his band the woods about Los Hatos, was receiving the fugitives.

In the general bewilderment of the collapse some jumped at the idea with joyful astonishment as upon the amazing discovery of a new hope. Others became fascinated by the prospect of immediate personal safety for their women and children. The majority caught at it as a drowning man catches at a straw.

Saracen infantry on the other hand was deemed by Leo VI to be little more than a <b>rabble</b> who lightly <b>armed,</b> could not match the Byzantine infantry.

60|$|The task {{before it}} was a {{difficult}} one. From all the various points from which the British had driven them--from Delhi, from Rohilcund, and the Doab, from Cawnpore, Furruckabad, Futtyghur, Etawah, Allyghur, Goruckpore, and other places--they retreated to Lucknow, and there were now collected sixty thousand revolted Sepoys and fifty thousand irregular troops, besides the <b>armed</b> <b>rabble</b> of the city of three hundred thousand souls. Knowing the storm that was preparing to burst upon their heads, they had neglected no means for strengthening their position. Great lines of fortifications had been thrown up; enormous quantities of guns placed in position; every house barricaded and loopholed, and the Kaiserbagh transformed into a veritable citadel. In hopes of destroying the force under General Sir James Outram, at the Alumbagh--which had been a thorn in their side for so long--a series of desperate attacks had been made upon them; but these had been uniformly defeated with heavy loss by the gallant British force. On the 3d of March the advanced division occupied the Dil Koosha, meeting with but slight resistance; and the commander-in-chief at once took up his headquarters here. The next three days were spent in making the necessary disposition for a simultaneous attack upon all sides of the town--General Outram on one side, Sir Hope Grant upon another, Jung Bahadoor, with his Nepaulese, on the third, and the main attack, under Sir Colin Campbell himself, on the fourth.|$|R
60|$|The day, whose decline we have {{hinted at}} in the {{preceding}} chapter, was fast verging towards its close, as {{the inhabitants of the}} streets on the western bank of the Tiber prepared to join the crowds that they beheld passing by their windows {{in the direction of the}} Basilica of St. Peter. The cause of this sudden confluence of the popular current in once common direction was made sufficiently apparent to all inquirers who happened to be near a church or a public building, by the appearance in such situations of a large sheet of vellum elaborately illuminated, raised on a high pole, and guarded from contact with the inquisitive <b>rabble</b> by two <b>armed</b> soldiers. The announcements set forth in these strange placards were all of the same nature and directed to the same end. In each of them the Bishop of Rome informed his 'pious and honourable brethren', the inhabitants of the city, that, as the next days was the anniversary of the Martyrdom of St. Luke, the vigil would necessarily be held on that evening in the Basilica of St. Peter; and that, in consideration of the importance of the occasion, there would be exhibited, before the commencement of the ceremony, those precious relics connected with the death of the saint, which had become the inestimable inheritance of the Church; and which consisted of a branch of the olive-tree to which St. Luke was hung, a piece of the noose--including the knot--which had been passed round his neck, and a picture of the Apotheosis of the Virgin painted by his own hand. After some sentences expressive of lamentation for the sufferings of the saint, which nobody read, and which it is unnecessary to reproduce here, the proclamation went on to state that a sermon would be preached in the course of the vigil, and that at a later hour the great chandelier, containing two thousand four hundred lamps, would be lit to illuminate the church. Finally, the worthy bishop called upon all members of his flock, in consideration of the solemnity of the day, to abstain from sensual pleasures, in order that they might the more piously and worthily contemplate the sacred objects submitted to their view, and digest the spiritual nourishment to be offered to their understandings.|$|R
60|$|Well had it {{been for}} Nelson if he had made no other sacrifices to this unhappy {{attachment}} than his peace of mind; but {{it led to the}} only blot upon his public character. While he sailed from Palermo, with the intention of collecting his whole force, and keeping off Maretimo, either to receive reinforcements there if the French were bound upwards, or to hasten to Minorca if that should be their destination, Captain Foote, in the Sea-horse, with the Neapolitan frigates, and some small vessels, under his command, was left to act with a land force consisting of a few regular troops, of four different nations, and with the <b>armed</b> <b>rabble</b> which Cardinal Ruffo called the Christian army. His directions were to co-operate to the utmost of his power with the royalists, at whose head Ruffo had been placed, and he had no other instructions whatever. Ruffo advancing without any plan, but relying upon the enemy's want of numbers, which prevented them from attempting to act upon the offensive, and ready to take advantage of any accident which might occur, approached Naples. Fort St. Elmo, which commands the town, was wholly garrisoned by the French troops; the castles of Uovo and Nuovo, which commanded the anchorage, were chiefly defended by Neapolitan revolutionists, the powerful men among them having taken shelter there. If these castles were taken, the reduction of Fort St. Elmo would be greatly expedited. They were strong places, and there was reason to apprehend that the French fleet might arrive to relieve them. Ruffo proposed to the garrison to capitulate, on condition that their persons and property should be guaranteed, and that they should, at their own option, either be sent to Toulon or remain at Naples, without being molested either in their persons or families. This capitulation was accepted: it was signed by the cardinal, and the Russian and Turkish commanders; and lastly, by Captain Foote, as commander of the British force. About six-and-thirty hours afterwards Nelson arrived in the bay with a force which had joined him during his cruise, consisting of seventeen sail of the line, with 1700 troops on board, and the Prince Royal of Naples in the admiral's ship. A flag of truce was flying on the castles, and on board the SEAHORSE. Nelson made a signal to annul the treaty; declaring that he would grant rebels no other terms than those of unconditional submission. The cardinal objected to this: nor could all the arguments of Nelson, Sir W. Hamilton, and Lady Hamilton, who took an active part in the conference, convince him that a treaty of such a nature, solemnly concluded, could honourably be set aside. He retired at last, silenced by Nelson's authority, but not convinced. Captain Foote was sent out of the bay; and the garrisons, taken out of the castles under pretence of carrying the treaty into effect, were delivered over as rebels to the vengeance of the Sicilian court. A deplorable transaction! a stain upon the memory of Nelson and the honour of England! To palliate it would be in vain; to justify it would be wicked: there is no alternative, for one who will not make himself a participator in guilt, but to record the disgraceful story with sorrow and with shame.|$|R
