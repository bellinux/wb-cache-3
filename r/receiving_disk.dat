For uniform and controlled supply of bulk, materials for transporting or processing machines use feeders. Among feeders in recent years, an increasing distribution <b>received</b> <b>disk</b> vibrating feeders, which are characterized by small size, without moving parts, prostate, reliability, accuracy and smooth control supply. Disk vibrating feeder has a horizontal spreading disk, which is located coaxially and with a gap below the outlet of the hopper. Spreading disk is connected with vibratory drive. This research was aimed at finding technical solutions ensuring the reduction of specific energy consumption of disk vibrating feeder. The study showed, that if the spreading disc perform with a central hole, which is closed by an elastic membrane, then this can significantly reduce the specific energy consumption per unit of production...|$|R

40|$|Apparatus {{for study}} of the {{phenomenon}} of rotation consisted of two rotating turntables constructed to <b>receive</b> <b>disks</b> for presenting varied visual stimuli. Turntables were graduated into 360 degrees for measurement of angular discrepancy in the task of visually matching rotational positions. Subjects from ages four through eleven attempted to match six compass positions for each of three designs [...] a boxlike house, a straight line, and Bender-Gestalt Figure No. 3. Errors of rotation were classed as either transpositional or nontranspositional, Transpositional error, involving reversal or mirroring of the directional aspect of the designs, largely disappeared by age six. Non-transpositional error declined rapidly between ages four and six, leveled off, then showed another significant decline at age nine. The three designs were readily conceptualized as to direction, showing no differences for inducing rotation. The error scores were minimally related to IQ and achievement. No correlation was found with rotation {{as measured by the}} Minnesota Percepto-Diagnostic Test. Groups at ages four, six, and eight were retested after one week, disclosing low reliabilities for non-transpositional error, though mean rotation error and standard deviation for the groups remained stable. Sixty-seven percent of four year olds showed instances of transposition, and as this source of error was scored as limited to fifty degrees and included in the composite score, the reliability for age four was raised from. 52 to. 96. A second study of children at ages four and five was conducted to verify the possibility of obtaining high reliability by combining both types of error. Utilizing some variations in methodology and designs, test-retest correlations over a two-week interval yielded a reliability of. 82 for age four and. 93 for age five. It was concluded that the method was applicable in assessing rotational error occurring on a perceptual-intuitive level, and that personal characteristics associated with perceptual-intuitive operations could be reliably measured at ages four and five...|$|R

The overall length rose by 17 in and the wheelbase rose by 230 mm.

50|$|The use of quality-controlled, commercially {{available}} receiving phases allow high reproducibility {{as compared to}} some other passive sampling devices. The bound receiving phase also ensures that the active sampling area of the device remains constant during laboratory or field calibration uptake experiments and in field deployments. By altering the combination of receiving phase and diffusion-limiting membrane (low-density polyethylene, polyethersulphone or cellulose acetate), you can monitor potable, surface , coastal and marine environment. The sampler can be deployed {{in the field for}} extended periods of time ranging from days to weeks. The specific pollutants of interest are sequestered by the samplers and these are retained on the <b>receiving</b> phase <b>disk.</b> After retrieval from the environment the pollutants are eluted from the disk and analysed in the laboratory using conventional instrumental methods. In order to obtain TWA concentrations the sampler must first be calibrated in the laboratory so as to ascertain the uptake rate (usually measured as the volume of water cleared per unit time i.e. L/h for the analyte) of the pollutant of interest. The Chemcatcher® has been used in a range of aquatic environments; however, most work to date has been in monitoring the TWA concentrations of priority and emerging pollutants surface waters.|$|R
