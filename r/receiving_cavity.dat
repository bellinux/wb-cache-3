40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method {{for the assessment}} of power radiated by a (treated) test panel. Conventional measurement techniques for panel radiation typically use either a diffuse field or a free-field as receiving environment. However, such an environment is not trivial to create, especially in a compact set-up. Therefore, a method is proposed to retrieve radiated power from a set of pressure measurements that can be applied in a small, reverberant <b>receiving</b> <b>cavity.</b> A base of modal shapes is used to describe the radiating panel velocity, complemented with a direct acoustic simulation of the <b>receiving</b> <b>cavity.</b> In this model, panel shape contribution factors are estimated from the pressure measurements. Finally, radiated power can be calculated from this model. For validation purpose, a bare plate case is considered, showing a good agreement between the original and reconstructed radiated power. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} was the design optimization, by means of {{accurate}} steady state 3 D CFD simulations, of a novel <b>receiving</b> <b>cavity</b> for Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) applications. The <b>receiving</b> <b>cavity</b> has been developed by Airlight Energy Manufacturing SA in collaboration with ETH Zurich and SUPSI-DTI-ICIMSIwithin {{the framework of the}} SolAir- 2 project. It is made of a helically coiled steel tube, and resulted highly effective in converting the radiative energy coming from the sun into thermal energy gathered by air which was selected as heat transfer fluid (HTF) being cheap, environmentally friendly and suitable for high temperatures applications. The main geometrical parameters considered for the optimization were: cavity height, varied by increasing or decreasing the number of coils, cavity external diameter, and the presence of a spiral coiled tube closing the cavity top. For each configuration the air flow rate, with an inlet temperature of 120 °C, was tuned in order to reach an outlet temperature close to the target value of 650 °C. Cavity performance were evaluated in terms of thermal efficiency and pressure drop under two different skew angle conditions for the incoming solar radiation, 18 ° and 40 °. CFD simulations were performed with Ansys Fluent.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} was to study, by means of {{accurate}} 3 D steady-state CFD simulations, the thermo-fluid dynamics behavior of a helically coiled heat exchanger (HCHE) constituting the <b>receiving</b> <b>cavity</b> of the novel CSP receiver based on Airlight Energy technology. In this innovative receiver design, air is used as heat transfer fluid (HTF), which, besides being inexpensive and environmentally friendly, is optimally suited for high temperature operation well beyond the limit of conventional HTFs. According to preliminary information related to the collectors orientation of the first 3. 9 MWth Airlight Energy pilot plant, under construction in Ait Baha (Morocco), two reference skew angles of the incoming solar radiation were considered and the <b>receiving</b> <b>cavity</b> performance were evaluated in terms of thermal efficiency and pressure drop. Among all, {{one of the main}} requirements was to achieve, at the outlet section of the HCHE, an air temperature of 650 °C; hence the mass flow rate was tuned accordingly. In order to minimize the pumping power requirements, the HCHE was designed to guarantee a laminar flow regime under all the operating conditions. Navier-Stokes, energy and radiation transport equations, the latter accounted for by the Discrete Ordinates (DO) model, were numerically solved, using the finite-volume method approach, with Fluent code from ANSYS. A meticulous experimental proof of concept was then carried out in Biasca (Switzerland) by the Swiss company Airlight Energy Manufacturing SA. The analysis of the experimental results, detailed in this paper, allowed to assess the reliability and effectiveness of this novel CSP receiver design in the solar energy harvesting...|$|E

Methods: Twenty samples were not restored and thirty <b>received</b> <b>cavity</b> preparations. Samples were assigned to five groups: G 1, G 2 : sound dentin (D); G 3 : composite resin (CR); G 4 : resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (RMGIC); G 5 : glass-ionomer cement (GIC). the samples of groups 25 were submitted to six cycles (demineralizationremineralization). Samples were analyzed by micro energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (mu-EDXRF) and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: Mineral loss was greater in G 2 samples than in RMGI > CR > GIC > D (control). SEM images showed pronounced dentin demineralization in groups 2 and 4. the acid erosion has {{a significant effect on}} mineral loss (Ca and P) of root dentin without restoration. Conclusions: Composite resin had the best chemical resistance to erosion among all the materials. Fluoride contained in GIC seemed to cause some protection, however, with material degradation.

A predictive model of mucositis could guide clinical decision-making and inform treatment planning. We aimed to generate such a model using spatial dose metrics and machine learning. Materials and methodsPredictive models of severe acute mucositis were generated using radiotherapy dose (dose–volume and spatial dose metrics) and clinical data. Penalised logistic regression, support vector classification and random forest classification (RFC) models were generated and compared. Internal validation was performed (with 100 -iteration cross-validation), using multiple metrics, including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration slope, to assess performance. Associations between covariates and severe mucositis were explored using the models. ResultsThe dose–volume-based models (standard) performed equally to those incorporating spatial information. Discrimination was similar between models, but the RFCstandard had the best calibration. The mean AUC and calibration slope for this model were 0. 71 (s. d. = 0. 09) and 3. 9 (s. d. = 2. 2), respectively. The volumes of oral <b>cavity</b> <b>receiving</b> intermediate and high doses were associated with severe mucositis.

G 2 firstly received a flowable layer of GIC and secondly a regular GIC layer. After 24 h water storage (37 degrees C), the teeth were made impermeable {{with the exception of}} the restoration area and 1 mm of their surrounding, immersed in 0. 5 % methylene blue solution (4 h), rinsed and sectioned mesio-distally.

Researchers have concluded that buffered chemical polishing on the inner surface of the cavity improves its performance. However the mechanism of chemical polishing is not well understood. A finite element computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model was developed to simulate the fluid flow characteristics of chemical etching process inside the cavity. The CFD model is then used to optimize the baffle design. The analysis confirmed the observation of other researchers that the iris section of the <b>cavity</b> <b>received</b> more etching than the equator regions. The baffle, which directs flow towards the walls of the cavity, was redesigned using optimization techniques. The redesigned baffle significantly improves the performance of the etching process. To verify these results an experimental setup for flow visualization was created. The setup consists of a high speed, high resolution CCD camera. The camera is positioned by a computer controlled traversing mechanism. A dye injecting arrangement is used for tracking the fluid path. The Experimental results are, in general, in agreement with the CFD and the optimization data...|$|R

The {{radius of}} <b>cavity</b> <b>Received</b> 16 September 1992 is 6. 5 A; the minimum is at 4. 38 A, {{and in this}} example the interaction of At-cavity is approximately equal to the interaction of Ar-Ar. Abstract. Noble gas atoms trapped in the intracrys-talline cavities of zeolites may form clusters. A classical-mechanical isoenergetic molecular dynamics imulation is 0. 02 performed to simulate the dynamical behavior of noble gas clusters in zeolite cavities. To implement the simulation, a model is adopted of a homogeneous spherical cavity with ~ 0. 01 Morse interaction between the noble gas atoms and cavity walls. The results for Ar 6 clusters indicate that the noble gas clusters in the cavity undergo the same solid/liquid phase changes as in free space, and, at high enough energies, a rapid exchange between atoms adsorbed on the inner surface-o, 0 and thosein {{the interior of the}} cavity. Mathematical quench-ing is used to investigated the multidimensional potential- 0, 02 surface of Ar clusters in the cavity...|$|R
