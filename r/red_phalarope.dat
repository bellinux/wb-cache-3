40|$|Abstract In {{sequentially}} polyandrous bird species, where females {{mate with}} dierent males in succession during a single breeding season, sperm stored by females can occasionally lead to extrapair fertilisations (EPFs) in clutches {{cared for by}} the second and subsequent males. Thus, we predicted that in <b>red</b> <b>phalaropes</b> (Phalaropus fulicarius) – a sex-role-reversed, sequentially polyan-drous, arctic breeding shorebird – EPFs would occur more frequently in clutches laid later in the breeding season. We used multilocus DNA profiling to examine the frequency and timing of EPFs in a population of <b>red</b> <b>phalaropes</b> breeding in the Canadian high arctic. Using a technique to determine parentage without maternal DNA, we inferred that 6 of 70 chicks in 18 broods re-sulted from EPFs – one extrapair chick in each of 6 broods. These results were supported by a further analysis using microsatellite DNA. As predicted, broods containing EPFs hatched from clutches laid significantly {{later in the season}} than did broods containing no EPFs. The dierence in median hatch dates between broods with and without EPFs was 9. 0 days, or 38 % of the entire egg-laying period in that season. For the whole breeding season, we estimated that 6. 5 % of chicks were sired by extrapair males, which is similar to extrapair paternity estimates for other sex-role-reversed birds, but relatively low compared to the majority of socially mo-nogamous species studied so far.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Landsat- 5 Thematic Mapper imagery {{was used}} to produce a 17 -habitat {{classification}} of Prince Charles Island, Foxe Basin, Northwest Territories, {{through a combination of}} supervised and unsupervised approaches. Breeding shorebirds and habitats were surveyed at 35 study plots in July 1989. Habitat-specific breeding densities calculated from these observations were used to estimate total populations of breeding shorebirds on the island based on areas of habitat derived from the classified image. Breeding densities were further modelled in two ways: first, to adjust for distance from the coast, where regression analyses found a significant relationship between distance and density, and second, to include only those pixels of areas considered suitable for breeding, using results of a proximity analysis to determine habitat associations between known breeding locations (pixels) and other habitats. Six species of shorebirds were found breeding on Prince Charles Island, with a combined population (after modelling) estimated at 294000 pairs. Comparison of breeding densities and estimated populations of shorebirds with those recorded at other arctic locations indicated that Prince Charles Island supports highly significant numbers of shorebirds, especially white-rumped sandpipers and <b>red</b> <b>phalaropes.</b> Comparison of reference areas of known habitat with those on the classified image indicated classification accuracy averaged over 90 %.

Use of the method over broad areas of the Arctic would require considerable work to recalibrate imagery for different geographic regions...|$|R
40|$|Both nest {{survival}} and incubation behaviour are highly variable among shorebirds (Charadrii), and we tested whether more conspicuous incubation behaviour increased {{the risk of}} nest predation. During 2000 - 2006, we monitored nest fate at 901 shorebird nests at three study sites across the circumpolar Arctic. Using miniature video recorders and nest temperature sensors, we obtained 782 days of behavioural data for 161 nests of 11 species. We related nest fate to the rate and duration of adults' nest absences or restless movements on the nest, {{as well as the}} total proportion of each day that adult birds engaged in these activities. Nest predation was positively related to the proportion of time that each species left the nest unattended. After controlling for species effects, the likelihood of a successful nesting attempt was lower for individuals that spent more time off the nest, but among failed nests, the number of days that a nest survived prior to depredation was not significantly predicted by measures of incubation behaviour. To control for weather or seasonal effects, we paired observations from nests that were ultimately depredated with observations from successful nests of the same species on the same day. In this paired sample (dominated by two species: <b>red</b> <b>phalaropes,</b> Phalaropus fulicarius, and little stints, Calidris minuta), both incubation recesses and restless movements were more numerous among failed versus successful nests. Our results suggest that more conspicuous incubation behaviour is indeed related to a higher risk of nest predation, and that this relationship may underlie patterns of nest survival within and among shorebird species.

40|$|Oceanographic features, such as fronts, eddies, and upwellings, provide {{important}} foraging areas for marine predators. These areas serve as important "hotspots" of marine life, by aggregating weakly swimming lower and mid-trophic level species which, in turn, attract foraging predators. Despite {{the importance of}} these dynamic features, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how they create foraging habitat for seabirds and other marine predators. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, I review current knowledge of how seabirds use oceanographic features with an emphasis on developing a more mechanistic understanding of these features, and identify important considerations for future studies. I use the findings of this review to inform two field research projects in the Bay of Fundy, Canada and Onslow Bay, North Carolina. In these two projects, I examined seabird abundance and distribution in relation to oceanographic features that occur at different spatial and temporal scales. In the first project, I examined foraging habitat of red-necked phalaropes (Phalaropus lobatus) in relation fine-scale tidal forcing near the Brier Island ledges in the Bay of Fundy. This research demonstrated the importance of biophysical interactions in creating phalarope habitat, and characterized red-necked phalarope habitat in both space and time. In Onslow Bay, I investigated the effects of Gulf Stream fronts and eddies on the abundance and distribution of seabirds using both remotely sensed and in situ data. I used fisheries acoustics surveys to investigate prey distribution within Gulf Stream frontal eddies. I then developed habitat models for the six most commonly sighted species or species groups (Cory's shearwaters, Calonectris diomedea; greater shearwaters (Puffinus gravis; Wilson's storm petrel, Oceanites oceanicus; Audubon's shearwaters, Puffinus lherminieri; black-capped petrels, Pterodrama hasitata; and <b>red</b> and red-necked <b>phalaropes,</b> grouped together as Phalaropus spp.) using multivariate modeling techniques. Gulf Stream frontal eddies influenced the abundance and distribution of seabirds in Onslow Bay, although frontal features were not as important in predicting seabird habitat as demonstrated in previous studies in the South Atlantic Bight. Prey availability in Gulf Stream frontal eddies was highest in eddy cold core regions, particularly in those regions close to the Gulf Stream. Taken together, the results of my dissertation: underscore the importance of conducting standardized surveys to assess dynamic environmental variables; demonstrate the use of multivariate methods to examine seabird foraging in relation to oceanographic features; emphasize the need to evaluate both prey distributions and physical regimes within oceanographic features at depth; and highlight the importance of temporal aspects of oceanographic features, such as the persistence and age of the features, when assessing the role that these features play in creating seabird foraging habitat.

40|$|Sex-role reversal, {{in which}} males care for offspring, can occur when mate {{competition}} is stronger between females than males. Secondary sex traits and mate attracting displays in sex-role-reversed species are usually {{more pronounced in}} females than in males. The <b>red</b> <b>phalarope</b> (Phalaropus fulicarius) is a textbook example of a sex-role-reversed species. It is generally agreed that males are responsible for all incubation and parental care duties, whereas females typically desert males after having completed a clutch and may pair with new males to lay additional clutches. The breeding plumage of female red phalaropes is usually more brightly colored than male plumage, a reversed sexual dichromatism usually associated with sex-role reversal. Here, we confirm with PCR-based sexing that male red phalaropes can exhibit both the red body plumage typical of a female and the incubation behavior typical of a male. Our result, combined with previous observations of brightly colored red phalaropes incubating nests at the same arctic location (Igloolik Island, Nunavut, Canada), suggests that plumage dichromatism alone may {{not be sufficient to}} distinguish males from females in this breeding population of red phalaropes. This stresses the need for more systematic genetic sexing combined with standardized description of intersexual differences in <b>red</b> <b>phalarope</b> plumages.

40|$|Seabird aggregations at sea {{have been}} shown to be {{associated}} with concentrations of prey. Previous research identified Central California as a highly used foraging area for seabirds, with locally breeding seabirds foraging close to their colonies on Southeast Farallon Island. Herein, we focus on nonresident (i. e. non-locally breeding) seabird species off of Central California. We hypothesized that high-use foraging areas for nonresident seabirds would be influenced by oceanographic and bathymetric factors and that spatial and temporal distributions would be similar within planktivorous and generalist foraging guilds but would differ between them. With data collected by the Applied California Current Ecosystem Studies (ACCESS) partnership during cruises between April and October from 2004 - 2013, we developed generalized linear models to identify high-use foraging areas for each of six nonresident seabird species. The four generalist species are Phoebastria nigripes (black-footed albatross), Ardenna griseus (sooty shearwater), Ardenna creatopus (pink-footed shearwater), and Fulmarus glacialis (northern fulmar). The two planktivorous species are Phalaropus lobatus (red-necked phalarope) and Phalaropus fulicarius (<b>red</b> <b>phalarope).</b> Sea surface temperature was significant for generalist species and sea surface salinity was important for planktivorous species. The distance to the 200 -m isobath was significant in five of six models, Pacific Decadal Oscillation with a 3 -month lag in four models, and sea surface fluorescence, the distance to Cordell Bank, and depth in three models. We did not find statistically significant differences between distributions of individual seabird species within a foraging guild or between guilds, with the exception of the sooty shearwater. Model results for a multi-use seabird foraging area highlighted the continental shelf break, particularly within the vicinity of Cordell Bank, as the highest use areas as did Marxan prioritization. Our research methods can be implemented elsewhere to identify critical habitat that needs protection as human development pressures continue to expand to the ocean...|$|E
40|$|This {{spring was}} a fairly normal, {{although}} I heard comments about warblers being rather tough to find. The reports did confirm that {{for many of the}} migrant northwoods species. There were a few rarities, none represented first state records, however. Foremost of these were White Ibis, Glossy Ibis, blue-morph Ross 2 ̆ 7 s Goos, Common Crane, Band-tailed Pigeon, Hammond 2 ̆ 7 s Flycatcher, and Black-throated Gray Warbler. The following birds may join these, although each may have fatal flaws, at least {{in the eyes of the}} NOURC: <b>Red</b> <b>Phalarope</b> and Slaty-backed Gull. Other interesting sightings included a Mississippi Kite in Lincoln; Gray Partridges in Scotts Bluff Co; 11 th state records for both Little Gull and Mew Gull; a 10 th location for Eurasian Collared-Dove; another (maybe?) White-winged Dove; Chuck-will 2 ̆ 7 s-widows in the Kearney area; Lewis 2 ̆ 7 s Woodpeckers in West Ash Creek Canyon; Pileated Woodpeckers continuing in Fontenelle Forest; an Acadian Flycatcher in Dixon Co; Blue-winged and Prairie Warblers near each other in Carter Canyon; the 17 th spring record of Pine Warbler but still with none documented; the 9 th (!) Panhandle Hooded Warbler; and the 10 th eastern record of Lazuli Bunting. A note is in order about reports of rare birds, either rare on a state level, or rare at the location or season. Each season I receive several such reports, many with excellent details of how the bird was identified. Those without details present a dilemma. In this (and subsequent) reports I will note observers of such sightings and follow their initials with 2 ̆ 2 details 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 no details 2 ̆ 2. The latter implies that the report, while possibly correct, is unverifiably so. This information is important for researchers who follow us and might have difficulty deciding which reports are substantiated and thus useful on a scientific level. While I make an effort to get details prior to writing this report, I am unable to contact some observers (especially those without email!). Observers who have a 2 ̆ 2 no details 2 ̆ 2 report listed here are encouraged to send details, even if they are late. I forward any information I receive on state-level rarities to Joel Jorgensen, Secretary of the NOU Records Committee, the body charged with maintaining the official state bird list...|$|E
