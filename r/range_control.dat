25|$|A rifle range, {{built around}} 1907, is {{situated}} on Chesil Beach, near Ferry Bridge. It had 100 yard increments up to 800 yards, and some remains of this structure {{can still be}} seen today. The Royal Navy operated a minesweeping trials range off West Bexington for many years following World War II. It was abandoned in the mid-1980s. The cables came ashore under the beach at the West Bexington car park, and today the <b>range</b> <b>control</b> building can still be seen behind the car park, while one of the theodolite stations is located {{near the entrance to}} the Cogden Beach car park.|$|E
25|$|The loss of {{the only}} Mk. IX prototype, along with its primary developer, seriously delayed the program. At {{about the same time}} the TRE had taken {{delivery}} of an SCR-720 unit from the US. This was a re-packaged and lightened version of the SCR-520, suitable for use in the Beaufighter and Mosquito. The first example arrived from Western Electric in December 1942, and testing against window was carried out by Jackson in January 1943. Jackson found that through judicious switching of the <b>range</b> <b>control</b> he could set the radar so it was looking at the bomber, and the window would quickly pass out of range and disappear.|$|E

The range also provides premier digital photographic and video services including operation of numerous still cameras, high speed and video systems for Range Safety support, surveillance, and post-launch analysis (e.g., failure analysis), project documentation (e.g., fabrication and test), administrative documentation, and archiving for environmental studies. In addition, WFF has a variety of communications systems and facilities to route voice, video, and data in support of launch processing, flight and test operations.|$|E

25|$|The {{range of}} the beam can vary between 65 and 300 meters, {{depending}} on traffic conditions. In traffic, the low beam cutoff position is adjusted vertically to maximise seeing range while keeping glare out of leading and oncoming drivers' eyes. When no traffic is close enough for glare to be a problem, the system provides full high beam. Headlamps are adjusted every 40 milliseconds by a camera {{on the inside of}} the front windscreen which can determine distance to other vehicles. The S-Class, CLS-Class and C-Class also offer this technology. In the CLS, the adaptive high beam is realised with LED headlamps - the first vehicle producing all adaptive light functions with LEDs. Since 2010 some Audi models with Xenon headlamps are offering a similar system: adaptive light with variable headlight <b>range</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

40|$|On the {{preceding}} paper, the authors expressed the DC Motor precise speed control with PLL-IC and {{the stability of}} PLL speed control loop as a sampled data feedback control was emphasized. This paper (2 nd Report) is the research and experimental report on the wide <b>range</b> speed <b>control</b> of DC motor with PLL-IC. On the stereo turn table drive and the most typical motor speed control with PLL-IC, the speed <b>control</b> <b>range</b> is comparatively small, but on industrial services of motor application wide speed <b>control</b> <b>range</b> is generally expected. We have developed a new control system, which enables wide <b>range</b> speed <b>control</b> by applying the parallel reference voltage proportional to the setting speed upon the phase comparator output. In this system, a wide <b>range</b> speed <b>control</b> is roughly operated by the minor speed control loop and only the precise speed control necessitated with motor load torque is executed by the PLL speed control loop. Accordingly we can decrease the PLL gain and improve the stability of PLL speed control loop. Two examples, one has an adjustable frequency devider inside of PLL loop and the other outside of PLL loop, are theoretically and experimentally compared...|$|R

40|$|This study {{assessed}} whether cortical thickness {{across the}} brain and regionally {{in terms of the}} default mode, salience, and central executive networks differentiates schizophrenia patients and healthy <b>controls</b> with normal <b>range</b> or below-normal range cognitive performance. Cognitive normality was defined using the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) composite score (T= 50  ±  10) and structural magnetic resonance imaging was used to generate cortical thickness data. Whole brain analysis revealed that cognitively normal <b>range</b> <b>controls</b> (n= 39) had greater cortical thickness than both cognitively normal (n= 17) and below-normal range (n= 49) patients. Cognitively normal controls also demonstrated greater thickness than patients in regions associated with the default mode and salience, but not central executive networks. No differences on any thickness measure were found between cognitively normal range and below-normal <b>range</b> <b>controls</b> (n= 24) or between cognitively normal and below-normal range patients. In addition, structural covariance between network regions was high and similar across subgroups. Positive and negative symptom severity did not correlate with thickness values. Cortical thinning across {{the brain and}} regionally in relation to the default and salience networks may index shared aspects of the psychotic psychopathology that defines schizophrenia with no relation to cognitive impairment...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{validity}} {{and significance of}} normal range neurocognition in schizophrenia remain unclear and controversial. We assessed whether normal <b>range</b> patients and <b>controls</b> demonstrate evidence of decline relative to premorbid ability and differ in performance profiles across measures, including those external to the normality criterion. In addition, we compared below normal <b>range</b> healthy <b>control</b> participants with patients at the same ability level. Performance normality {{was defined as a}} MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) composite T score between 40 and 60. Patients (n= 17) and controls (n= 24) meeting the criterion were compared on MCCB domain scores and on independent measures of reading ability, probabilistic and social reasoning. Patients (n= 19) and controls (n= 20) scoring below 40 on the MCCB composite were compared on the same set of measures. Cognitively normal <b>range</b> patients and <b>controls</b> did not differ on estimated premorbid ability or decline and differed only on the Processing Speed domain of the MCCB. Performance did not differ across other domains or on social and probabilistic reasoning tasks. Cognitively below normal <b>range</b> patients and <b>controls</b> showed marked discrepancies between premorbid and current ability, but there were no group differences. In addition, below normal range groups did not differ on any MCCB domain score or in terms of external cognitive measures. Cognitively normal range schizophrenia patients may be largely indistinguishable from normal <b>range</b> <b>controls,</b> with the exception of processing speed performance. More typical schizophrenia patients below the normal range may be indistinguishable from low-performing controls even in terms of processing speed...|$|R
