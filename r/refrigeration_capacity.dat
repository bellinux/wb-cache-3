For higher V substitution (x = 0. 12), the martensite transition {{is lower than}} the conventional ferromagnetic transition. Large magnetic entropy change values of about 12. 4, 16. 2 and 19 J kg(- 1) K- 1 and corresponding <b>refrigeration</b> <b>capacities</b> of 60. 6, 82. 5, and 103 J kg(- 1) were observed for x = 0, 0. 04 and 0. 08 alloys, respectively.

Mn 1 −xFexCoGe compounds with compositions in the range x = 0. 01 to 0. 03 exhibit magneto-structural transitions. Neutron diffraction experiments were carried out on the Mn 0. 98 Fe 0. 02 CoGe sample over the temperature range of 5 K to 450 K.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{performance}} of a cascade system in subcritical operation using the pair R 744 / R 134, as an option to conventional systems in supermarkets, which usually uses R 404 A, or R 22. The experimental apparatus consists of a variable speed reciprocating compressor for R 744 and an electronic expansion valve that promotes direct evaporation of the CO 2 inside a cold room (2. 3 m x 2. 6 m x 2. 5 m) to maintain the internal air temperature stable. The high-temperature cycle consists of a reciprocating compressor for R 134 a, a thermostatic expansion valve, and an air-cooled condenser. A plate heat exchanger, which is at the same time, the condenser for the R 744 and evaporator to R 134 a completes the setup. Two parameters were manipulated: The superheating degree of the R 744, 5 - 20 K, and the R 744 compressor operation frequency, 40 - 65 Hz. In order to contribute to the improvement of the cooling processes, mainly about the sustainability and energy efficiency, a drop-in has been made at the high-temperature cycle, whose R 134 a load has been replaced by R 404 A. The alternative cooling system (R 744 / R 404 A) was subjected to two stages of tests which allowed the energy comparison between the two refrigerant sets. Through the obtained results, it was estimated maximum COP equivalent to 1. 36 and a minimum value of 1. 06 for the R 744 / R 134 a pair, demonstrating the applicability of this cascade system of variable thermal load conditions, the values â€‹â€‹of capacity cooling, settled between 4. 09 and 5. 13 kW.

50|$|Finally, another {{widespread}} {{application of}} subcooling is boosting and economising.

It is to be noted that superheating has exactly the inverse effect, and that an internal heat exchanger alone, {{is not able to}} increase the capacity of the system because the boosting effect of subcooling is dimmed by the superheating, making the net capacity gain equal to zero.

The motivation of this compar-ison is based on the efforts done {{to solve the problem of}} high GWP of R 134 a, since RE 170 shows a significantly lower one. The study is developed on the analysis of the effect of evaporation pressure on some of important factors which should be considered in the selection of a new refrigerant: evaporation pressure, pressure ratio, Coefficient of Performance, power per ton of <b>refrigeration,</b> volumetric cooling <b>capacity.</b> The evaporation temperature will vary in the range (− 20,+ 10) oC and the condensation temperature is kept constant, at 45 oC. Since cycle performance can be improved by superheating and sub cooling inclusion, these two processes were considered in the cycle. Comparative results show that RE 170 could replace R 134 a, due to its low evaporation pressure and pressure ratio and also to its better COP and similar volumetric cooling capacity. c © SEECMAR | All rights reserved 1...|$|R
