The purpose of this study was to determine if using proper transfer skills as measured by the Transfer Assessment Instrument (TAI) is associated with reduced loading on the upper extremities. Twenty-three wheelchair users performed transfers to a level-height bench while a series of forces plates, load cells, and a motion capture system recorded the biomechanics of their natural transferring techniques. Their transfer skills were simultaneously evaluated by two study clinicians using the TAI. Logistic regression and multiple linear regression models were used to determine the relationships between TAI scores and the kinetic variables on both arms across all joints. The results showed that the TAI measured transfer skills were closely associated with the magnitude and timing of joint moments (P<. 02, model R 2 values ranged from 0. 27 to 0. 79).

Another study suggested that shoulder injuries observed in suited subjects who train in the NBL may be attributed to excessive righting moments caused by a non-optimal weigh out. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a mathematical model to predict and maintain the neutral buoyancy of suited subjects during training operations at the NBL. Due to time constraints, one certified NBL support diver served as a subject (height: 66. 54 in; weight: 182 lbs) for this study and only one complete test was conducted. The study was divided into two runs for which the first run required the NBL divers to perform a weigh out similar to a suited astronaut on a scuba diver wearing a mock Portable Life Support System and a Displays and Control Module. For the second run, the same subject and equipment were weighed out according to the mathematical model. The objective of each run was to achieve a neutrally buoyant subject floating 450 to the pool floor. Motion data was collected using two underwater cameras and analyzed using Dartfish video analysis software while force and moment data were recorded using an AMTI force plate.

Further, {{the shoulders and}} back are involved in many tasks, including manual materials handling, but flexibility as to their relative roles in performing a task exists. In nursing, where manual patient handling (MPH) occurs daily, a risk of injury exists resulting from interactions with patients that may require awkward postures or sudden shifts in hand forces. Although some recommended MPH techniques have been advocated, many focus on lowering the risk of low back injury, without considering {{the effect of these}} techniques on other body regions. This study aimed to identify differences in shoulder and back physical exposures between performing self-selected and recommended patient handling techniques designed to reduce low back exposures. Twenty female participants performed three repetitions of five manual patient handling tasks using a self selected technique, followed by three repetitions of the same tasks using techniques learned in an interposed training session. Peak, mean and cumulative muscle activity, peak <b>resultant</b> <b>moment,</b> and ratings of perceived exertion were compared for each of the tasks before and after training, as well as identifying meaningful changes between the joints in mean population strength using a static strength prediction program. Significant decreases occurred at both the left and right shoulders and the low back for most measures, generally supporting the recommended techniques. Important exceptions existed, however, for the Sit-to-Chair tasks and Turn Toward tasks, where increases in several individual shoulder muscle activities, along with peak <b>resultant</b> <b>moment,</b> existed.

The amount of bending that beams composed of such materials can sustain is limited by the constraint. Potential applications of the results to the biomechanics of soft tissues are indicated...|$|R
