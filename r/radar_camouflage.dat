40|$|Periscopes reflect radar energy both {{directly}} and by multiple reflection from the water's surface {{back to the}} radar unit. Radar reflections have also been observed by the water disturbance. A report is {{to be made on}} the development and check of the effectiveness of <b>radar</b> <b>camouflage</b> for periscopes. A special demonstration conceptwilh which it is possible to measure the radar cross-section ofthe periscope, including the surrounding rough water's surface, under reproducible boundary conditions has been developed for this purpose. The set-up of such a measurement system and the related radar signature measurements are shown. The measurements were carried out with an uncamouflaged and a camouflaged periscope. The RCS values are compared with empirical values from sea surveillance radars against known radar cross-sections. The detection ranges against camouflaged periscopes as well as the camouflage concept for the periscope are decribed. 1 JNTRODUCTION Radar measurements on periscopes have been performed on numerous occasions in the past. Measurements taken on the retractable instrument purely under laboratory conditions and several measuring campaigns conducted at sea or on inland waters produced no consistent data. The reflection via the sea surface were either not included or, in the case offree-field measurements, the largenumber ofuncontrollable ambient influences (wind, wave height, augment ofthe main wave crests etc) caused wide scatterin...|$|E
40|$|Observing the {{progress}} in the technology of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) than it can be foreseen {{that in the future}} the role of manned combat aircraft will be taken over more and more by unmanned systems. The abandonment of pilots allows for more freedom in the aerodynamic design of the vehicle in regard to weight and acceleration, however, new stealth constraints have a severe impact. The design of UCAV configurations is driven by the special requirements of upcoming missions, as for instance the capabilities of long endurance fl ights joined with a low observability. The new demands have a crucial impact on the aerodynamic shape, and, hence, require new solutions for maneuver con- trol in respect to integration of engine in- and outlets, actuators and other devices. Additionally the new capabilities of long endurance ights has to be joined with low observability. In particular UCAVs are suited to the exploitation of non-conventional control technologies, such as aerodynamic morphing, flow control, or thrust vectoring. This paper presents a numerical investigation of innovative morphing technologies for aircraft applications and explores the feasibility for such technologies to enhance the maneuverability of unmanned combat aerial vehicles. In Aerodynamics the morphing is understood as a smooth, continuous change in geometry of the outer surface, e. g. the twist of complete wing can be changed in order control role moments. In the considered case morphing is used to provide additional ow control mechanisms taking into account the constraint of fllow radar signature. In particular morphing can be used to change the geometry of the airfoil leading edge to control the ow around the wings in order to generate additional lift or induce role moments. This paper is concerned with the investigation of the feasibility and effectiveness of morphing devices for the aerodynamic control of UCAVs. Focal point of this work is the morphing of leading edges in order to generate additional lift or role moments for UCAVs flying in high angle of attack mode. Therefore, the objective of the numerical investigations is the evaluation of the potential of morphing leading edges especially for the enhancement of the maneuverability of Delta- and Lambda-wing configurations with their vortex-dominated ow field. Of special interest is ow control at high angles of attack (AoA) by targeting an minimized shape adaptation in order to generate a needed additional lift, to induce role moments or {{to reduce the risk of}} the potential deleterious effects of vortex breakdown. The morphing of the leading edge must not confused with classical Kruger leading edge flaps. Although very effective in regard to the increase of lift such fl aps can't be used for UCAVs since gaps between fl aps and the wing have to be avoided in order to fulll the hard conditions of <b>radar</b> <b>camouflage.</b> The presented work is part of the DLR Project FaUSST which is the successor of the DLRProject UCAV- 2010. The UCAV- 2010 project was set up to identify and assess UCAV relevant technologies. The investigations have covered the pre-design process with fast, low fidelity methods as well as the detailed examination using high fidelity methods like URANS simulations. The verification of the promissing technologies and tools have been done by virtual and experimental prototypes. The combined research has lead to a Lambda wing type UCAV configuration with a medium sweep of the leading edge. The outcoming DLR-F 17 conguration has been mainly derived from the so called Saccon geometry developed by EADS-MAS for the RTO/AVT- 161 task group. Since the capability of medium to high AoA maneuverability will be investigated the angle of attack has been varied from 6 to 16 degrees. After presentation of the technical part, the results of leading edge manipulation are discussed. One focal point is the comparison of the impact of differently morphed leading edge shapes on the fl ight performance at specific flight situations. The aerodynamical coefficients, in particular Cl, Cd and Cm, are related to morphing parameters of the changed shape of the leading edges. Another key aspect is the varied effective angle of attack of the middle part of the wings, see Figure 2. In case of a basic high angle of attack the effective AoA (due to morphing) can change the vortical flow above the deformed wings enormously, even when the geometrical angle of the airfoil has been morphed only slightly. This work discusses the effectiveness of counter-rotating morphing of leading edges, since the requirements in regard to radar signature do not allow large geometry changes. This point reduces the degree of freedom of any shape morphing drastically. Thereto, only proper combinations of left and associated right wing deformations have been analyzed and discussed. After the discussion of the most interesting deformations an evaluation of the presented test cases in regard to the maneuverability enhancement of UCAVs concludes the presentation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGraphite nanosheets (GNS) were {{prepared}} by surfactant assisted ultrasonication from expanded graphite (EG) {{and followed by}} coating onto vinylon fabrics with water-borne polyurethane (WPU). The morphology of GNS and GNS/polyurethane (PU) coatings was characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), {{and the structure of}} GNS was studied by fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Electromagnetic (EM) parameters indicated that GNS is a kind of dielectric loss material, in which little magnetic loss is found. Reflection loss (RL) results showed that both GNS content and coated thickness had great influences on the microwave absorption. For the fabric coated with GNS/PU nanocomposites (30 / 100 by weight, wet thickness of 0. 39 mm for dry areal density in 130 g/m 2), RL values exceeding − 5 dB could be obtained in the frequency range of 10. 7 – 18 GHz, while − 10 dB in 12. 7 – 18 GHz, and a minimum value of − 28 dB at 15. 2 GHz. These GNS/PU coated fabrics are light and flexible with much thin and low-cost coated layer, and showed great potential in <b>radar</b> <b>camouflaging</b> and electromagnetic interference application...|$|R
5|$|Camouflage for {{equipment}} and positions was extensively developed for military {{use by the}} French in 1915, soon followed by other World War I armies. In both world wars, artists were recruited as camouflage officers. Ship camouflage developed via conspicuous dazzle camouflage schemes during WWI, but since the development of <b>radar,</b> ship <b>camouflage</b> has received less attention. Aircraft, especially in World War II, were often painted with different schemes above and below, to camouflage them against the ground and sky respectively.|$|R
50|$|Camouflage {{has been}} used to protect {{military}} equipment such as vehicles, guns, ships, aircraft and buildings as well as individual soldiers and their positions.Vehicle camouflage techniques begin with paint, which offers at best only limited effectiveness. Other methods for stationary land vehicles include covering with improvised materials such as blankets and vegetation, and erecting nets, screens and soft covers which may suitably reflect, scatter or absorb near infrared and radar waves. Some military textiles and vehicle camouflage paints also reflect infrared to help provide concealment from night vision devices.After the Second World War, <b>radar</b> made <b>camouflage</b> generally less effective, though coastal boats are sometimes painted like land vehicles.

40|$|By {{means of}} data from highly {{resolved}} tower-turntable ISAR measurements this paper investigates the influence of camouflage on the ATR performance. The recognition process {{is based on a}} template matching method. The two-dimensional templates are generated by extracting the most robust scatterers from the RCS image. Based on data sets of ISAR tower-turntable measurements, this paper shows the potential effect of some different camouflage methods on the ATR performace of a HR X band <b>radar</b> system. <b>Camouflage</b> by covering the target with birch branches is as well tested as occlusion by radar nets. Of course, a significant attenuation of the radar signal by the coverage of the target is precondition for affecting the ATR performance. This given, the degree of occlusion determines the impact on the reconnaissance, or other wise regarded, the applied ATR system shows a good robustness, if the target is only partially occluded. Additionaly, tests are undertaken to investigate the influence of multi-path effects by a reflecting ground. Here also, a remarkable effect on the ATR performance can be observed, depending on the degree of coverage of the target surrounding area. Finally, for complemantary a decoy designed for optical and infra-red application is tested with a classifier trained on the origin target. There, no deception of our ATR system can be observed. ...|$|R
50|$|With the Japanese {{southern}} and center forces defeated, Leyte Gulf was secured. The {{next several days}} were quiet ones for Tennessee, though the Japanese sent numerous land-based air strikes against Leyte Gulf. On 29 October, the battlewagon's crew was told that their next destination {{was to be the}} Puget Sound Navy Yard. This refit made no remarkable changes in Tennessees appearance. Her main battery directors received improved models of the Mark 8 radar, and the Mark 4 radars used with the 5 in gun directors were replaced by the newer combination of paired Mark 12 and Mark 22 dual-purpose equipment. Tennessees usefulness as an anti-aircraft ship was enhanced by the addition of a model SP height-finding <b>radar.</b> Her pattern <b>camouflage</b> scheme was replaced by a dark gray finish which was calculated to provide a less conspicuous aiming point for kamikaze planes, introduced during the recapture of the Philippines and becoming more and more of a fact of naval life during the winter of 1944 and 1945.|$|R
