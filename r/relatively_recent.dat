5|$|The {{result of}} {{faulting}} {{has been to}} often juxtapose <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> rocks with much older rocks.|$|E
5|$|A {{recent study}} by {{researchers}} of the University of Hawaii at Manoa and the Oregon State University indicates that the SAR11 clade of bacteria shares a <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> common ancestor with the mitochondria existing in most eukaryotic cells.|$|E
5|$|A <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> impact created Cone crater, 1,000 {{feet across}} and 250 feet deep, near the landing site of Apollo 14. One {{of the main}} {{objectives}} of that mission was to sample the original Imbrium material located on its rim.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the sugar}} is <b>relatively</b> rare, <b>recent</b> work with glycosyltransferases {{suggests}} that obscure sugars such as colitose {{can be incorporated}} into existing natural-product scaffolds, thereby constructing novel and potentially therapeutic compounds.|$|R
50|$|While some {{countries}} with longstanding terrorism problems, such as Israel, have {{law enforcement agencies}} primarily designed to prevent and respond to terror attacks, in other nations, counter-terrorism is a <b>relatively</b> more <b>recent</b> objective of civilian police and law enforcement agencies.|$|R
50|$|Though {{trade in}} banned small arms and {{ammunition}} is <b>relatively</b> insignificant, <b>recent</b> reports include: imports totaling $45,500 by Brazil in 2007, of $3.1 million by the United Arab Emirates in 2006, and $364,400 by Ethiopia in 2005, and $121,400 by Mexico in 2005.|$|R
5|$|Fivefold {{repetition}} of position: Similar to the threefold-repetition rule, {{but in this}} case neither player needs to claim the draw; thus a tournament director can intervene and declare the game to be drawn. This is a <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> (2014) addition to the FIDE rules.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49 a cholera {{epidemic}} killed 14,601 {{people in}} London and overwhelmed the burial system completely. Bodies were left stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> graves were exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials.|$|E
5|$|Noctilucent clouds {{can form}} only under very {{restricted}} conditions during local summer; their occurrence {{can be used}} as a sensitive guide to changes in the upper atmosphere. They are a <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> classification. The occurrence of noctilucent clouds appears to be increasing in frequency, brightness and extent.|$|E
50|$|L-vocalization {{established}} {{a pattern that}} would influence the spelling pronunciations of some <b>relatively</b> more <b>recent</b> loanwords like Balt, Malta, polder, waltz and Yalta. It also influenced English spelling reform efforts, explaining the American English mold and molt {{as opposed to the}} traditional mould and moult.|$|R
50|$|The Zaboli and the Baluch are <b>relatively</b> of <b>recent</b> arrival, {{and date}} back to the early 20th century. They are still {{arriving}} into the area in some numbers due to the lasting drought in their home areas of Sistan (the capital of which being Zabol) and Baluchistan.|$|R
5000|$|As a Rigvedic termss, gotra {{simply means}} [...] "cow pen" [...] or [...] "herd of cows". The {{specific}} meaning [...] "family, lineage kin" [...] (as it were [...] "herd within an enclosure") is <b>relatively</b> more <b>recent,</b> first recorded around the mid-1st millennium BCE (e.g., Chandogya Upanishad).|$|R
5|$|The {{fossil record}} for nuthatches is sparse, and in Europe {{is limited to}} the extinct Sitta senogalliensis from the Lower Miocene in Italy and {{somewhat}} later material from France; the family appears to be of <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> origin.|$|E
5|$|Another {{widespread}} and popular dish is moussaka, a baked dish of aubergine or potato with various other ingredients: often minced meat and tomatoes, sometimes {{a layer of}} egg custard or béchamel sauce on top. In its Greek variant, well-known outside the region, it includes layers of aubergine and minced meat with custard or béchamel sauce on top, but that version is a <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> innovation, introduced by the chef Nikolaos Tselementes in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|As the Laws were {{formulated}} in England, and were initially administered solely {{by the four}} British football associations within IFAB, the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> history of metrication (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.|$|E
40|$|Query {{expansion}} by pseudo-relevance {{feedback is}} a well-established technique in both mono- and cross- lingual information retrieval, enriching and disambiguating the typically terse queries provided by searchers. Comparable document-side expansion is a <b>relatively</b> more <b>recent</b> development motivated by error-prone transcription and translation processes in spoken document and cross-language retrieval...|$|R
50|$|Josephus's Against Apion is a two-volume defence of Judaism as {{classical}} {{religion and}} philosophy, stressing its antiquity, {{as opposed to}} what Josephus claimed was the <b>relatively</b> more <b>recent</b> tradition of the Greeks. Some anti-Judaic allegations ascribed by Josephus to the Greek writer Apion, and myths accredited to Manetho are also addressed.|$|R
5000|$|Seblak is <b>relatively</b> a <b>recent</b> invention, {{this new}} street food {{appeared}} in Bandung circa 2000s. It {{is suggested that}} the dish was originally started as a method to avoid wasting uneaten old krupuk; a way to safely (and pleasantly) consume stale old krupuk by cooking it with other ingredients, {{to make it more}} satisfying.|$|R
5|$|Bismuth {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} and has {{according to some}} reports been common in <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> times. As with lead, bismuth poisoning can result {{in the formation of}} a black deposit on the gingiva, known as a bismuth line. Poisoning may be treated with dimercaprol; however, evidence for benefit is unclear.|$|E
5|$|In 1831 and 1848, serious {{outbreaks}} of cholera had overwhelmed the crowded cemeteries of London, causing bodies to be stacked in heaps awaiting burial, and even <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> graves to be exhumed {{to make way}} for new burials. Public health policy at this time was generally shaped by the miasma theory, and the bad smells and risks of disease caused by piled bodies and exhumed rotting corpses caused great public concern.|$|E
5|$|On the Snake River {{in southeastern}} Washington {{there are several}} ancient sites. One {{of the oldest and}} most {{well-known}} is called the Marmes Rockshelter, which was used from over 11,000 years ago to <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> times. The Marmes Rockshelter was flooded in 1968 by Lake Herbert G. West, the Lower Monumental Dam's reservoir.|$|E
40|$|In the San Joaquin Valley, a {{wide variety}} of {{pesticides}} are applied throughout the summer growing season (DPR, 2001 a). <b>Relatively</b> little <b>recent</b> surface water monitoring has been conducted in the San Joaquin basin during the summer season. Such monitoring data are needed to characterize the current summer distribution and concentrations of pesticides in the San Joaquin River. Pesticides were selecte...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{on these}} fragile {{ecosystem}} are scanty {{and the few}} available w ere <b>relatively</b> of <b>recent</b> attempts. But the far sighted and the intelligent local elders transplanted the sea grass beds {{to many of the}} Northern islands for controlling the erosion in the 1950 s itself. The elderly locals even now call them Kavarattipullu as it was introduced from Kavaratti lagoon...|$|R
25|$|This {{area of the}} {{neighborhood}} has been <b>relatively</b> untouched by <b>recent</b> gentrification efforts and may resemble historic OTR better than other areas, though future investment may change this space in the future.|$|R
5|$|The Mafia of Villalba was of <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> origin, {{as it did}} {{not go back to}} the 1860s, {{considered}} to be the period when the Mafia emerged around Palermo. It started as a form of private protection and {{has little to do with}} large estates as was the case in many other rural areas where many mafiosi started as caretakers and lease-holders (gabelloto or bailiff) for absentee landlords.|$|E
5|$|Allowing the enpassant capture, {{together}} {{with the introduction of}} the two-square first move for pawns, {{was one of the last}} major rule changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600. Other <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> rule changes were castling, the unlimited range for queens and bishops (Spanish master Ruy López de Segura gives the rule in his 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez) and a change to the rules on pawn promotion. In most places the en passant rule was adopted at the same time as allowing the pawn to move two squares on its first move, but it was not universally accepted until the Italian rules were changed in 1880.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{summarised}} his speculation in {{his essay}} on the Elevation of Patagonia. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by the Beagles officers {{as well as his}} own measurements to propose that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been <b>relatively</b> <b>recent,</b> and could have affected human history.|$|E
5000|$|The term Subpirineu {{was first}} used in 1938 by Catalan {{geographer}} and geologist Lluís Solé. He justified the separateness of the Sub-Pyrenees from the Pre-Pyrenees and the Transversal Range {{on the basis of}} the material composition of the mountains, as well as the <b>relatively</b> more <b>recent</b> character of the anticline and the evidence of fractures. The name [...] "Sub-Pyrenees" [...] was systematically accepted in the 1958 work Geografia de Catalunya.|$|R
50|$|The council ward, {{including}} the village centre and surrounding precincts, occupies 5.11 square kilometres (1,260 acres, 511 hectares). The community's population has remained <b>relatively</b> static in <b>recent</b> times and was 2,652 at the census held in 2001.|$|R
50|$|The {{sanctions}} on environment include {{both economic and}} political issues such as trade since these are all interdependent. The trade barriers and restrictions on trade are the key factors since they are engaged {{with the problems of}} endangered species, ozone-depleting chemicals and environmental laws. Although the sanctions and laws regarding the environment are <b>relatively</b> new, <b>recent</b> concerns over the environmental issues encouraged individuals and governments to actively cooperate in dealing the problems.|$|R
5|$|Like the Milky Way, the Andromeda Galaxy has {{satellite}} galaxies, {{consisting of}} 14 known dwarf galaxies. The best known and most readily observed satellite galaxies are M32 and M110. Based on current evidence, {{it appears that}} M32 underwent a close encounter with the Andromeda Galaxy in the past. M32 may once have been a larger galaxy that had its stellar disk removed by M31, and underwent a sharp increase of star formation in the core region, which lasted until the <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> past.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the breed in America is <b>relatively</b> <b>recent.</b> The first {{recorded}} Cavalier living in the United States was brought from the United Kingdom in 1956 by W. Lyon Brown, together with Elizabeth Spalding and other enthusiasts, she founded the Cavalier King Charles Club USA which continues to the present day. In 1994, the American Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Club was created {{by a group of}} breeders to apply for recognition by the American Kennel Club. The Cavalier would go on to be recognised by the American Kennel Club in 1995, and the ACKCSC became the parent club for Cavaliers.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the two moons is not well understood. Their low albedo and {{carbonaceous}} chondrite composition have been regarded as similar to asteroids, supporting the capture theory. The unstable orbit of Phobos would seem to point towards a <b>relatively</b> <b>recent</b> capture. But both have circular orbits, near the equator, which is unusual for captured objects and the required capture dynamics are complex. Accretion early {{in the history of}} Mars is plausible, but would not account for a composition resembling asteroids rather than Mars itself, if that is confirmed.|$|E
40|$|Tissue and organ {{architectures}} {{are incredibly}} diverse, yet {{our knowledge of}} the morphogenetic behaviors that generate them is <b>relatively</b> limited. <b>Recent</b> studies have revealed unexpected mechanisms that drive axis elongation in the Drosophila egg, including an unconventional planar polarity signaling pathway, a distinctive type of morphogenetic movement termed “global tissue rotation,” a molecular corset-like role of extracellular matrix, and oscillating basal cellular contractions. We review here what is known about Drosophila egg elongation, compare it to other instances of morphogenesis, and highlight several issues of general developmental relevance...|$|R
50|$|Private LTC {{insurance}} {{is growing in}} popularity in the US. Premiums have remained <b>relatively</b> stable in <b>recent</b> years. However, the coverage is quite expensive, especially when consumers wait until retirement age to purchase it. The average age of new purchasers was 61 in 2005, and has been dropping.|$|R
40|$|Hardanodising of aluminiium at low {{electrolyte}} temperatures from 0 °C and {{at current}} densities of 2 A/dm 2 to 6 A/dm 2, {{gives rise to}} hard oxide layers, so-called Hard Anodising. Given the very high electrical resistance of such oxide layers and the reduced electrolytic coductivity of the cooled electrolytes, the process is <b>relatively</b> energy-intensive. <b>Recent</b> {{research has shown that}} oxide layers of the required hardness (> 400 HV) and of thickness around 40 µm can also be formed at higher eelctrolyte temperatures, thereby achieving valuable energy savings...|$|R
