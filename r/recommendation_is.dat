5|$|Determination of TPO {{antibodies}} may {{be considered}} {{as part of the}} assessment of recurrent miscarriage, as subtle thyroid dysfunction can be associated with pregnancy loss, but this <b>recommendation</b> <b>is</b> not universal, and presence of thyroid antibodies may not predict future outcome.|$|E
5|$|Miking a Leslie is also {{important}} in a recording studio, as the choice and positioning of microphones determines the overall recorded sound. A popular <b>recommendation</b> <b>is</b> two Shure SM57s on the horn and a Sennheiser MD421 on the drum. Recording Magazine's Dave Martin suggests a similar setup, with various microphone models used as stereo pairs on the horn but using an Electro-Voice RE20 on the drum instead. Keith Emerson recorded his Leslie using a single mic each on the horn and the drum, but with the covers removed.|$|E
5|$|Interferons, a {{subclass}} of cytokines, {{are produced}} in the body during illnesses such as influenza {{in order to help}} fight the infection. They are responsible of many of the symptoms of influenza infections, including fever, muscle aches, fatigue, and headaches. Many patients report influenza-like symptoms hours after taking interferon-beta that usually improve within 24 hours, being such symptoms related to the temporary increase of cytokines. This reaction tends to disappear after 3 months of treatment and its symptoms can be treated with over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen, that reduce fever and pain. Another common transient secondary effect with interferon-beta is a functional deterioration of already existing symptoms of the disease. Such deterioration is similar to the one produced in MS patients due to heat, fever or stress (Uhthoff's phenomenon), usually appears within 24 hours of treatment, is more common in the initial months of treatment, and may last several days. A symptom specially sensitive to worsening is spasticity. Interferon-beta can also reduce numbers of white blood cells (leukopenia), lymphocytes (lymphopenia) and neutrophils (neutropenia), as well as affect liver function. In most cases these effects are non-dangerous and reversible after cessation or reduction of treatment. Nevertheless, <b>recommendation</b> <b>is</b> that all patients should be monitored through laboratory blood analyses, including liver function tests, to ensure safe use of interferons.|$|E
50|$|In Scotland, the <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> {{submitted}} in November 2004, {{and approved}} in February 2005.

5|$|Women with anti-TPO {{antibodies}} who {{are trying}} to become pregnant (naturally or by assisted means) may require thyroid hormone supplementation even if the TSH level is normal. This is particularly true if they have had previous miscarriages or have been hypothyroid in the past. Supplementary levothyroxine may reduce the risk of preterm birth and possibly miscarriage. The <b>recommendation</b> <b>is</b> stronger in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism (defined as TSH 2.5–10mIU/l) who are anti-TPO positive, in view of the risk of overt hypothyroidism. If a decision is made not to treat, close monitoring of the thyroid function (every 4 weeks in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy) is recommended. If anti-TPO is not positive, treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism is not currently recommended. It has been suggested that many of the aforementioned recommendations could lead to unnecessary treatment, {{in the sense that the}} TSH cutoff levels may be too restrictive in some ethnic groups; there may be little benefit from treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in certain cases.|$|E
25|$|The UK and WHO <b>recommendation</b> <b>is</b> 2HREZ/4HR; the US <b>recommendation</b> <b>is</b> 2HREZ/7HR.

25|$|The UK <b>recommendation</b> <b>is</b> 18HE or 12HEZ. The US <b>recommendation</b> <b>is</b> 9 to 12HEZ, {{with the}} option of adding a {{quinolone}} (for example, MXF).|$|E
30|$|In addition, the {{relevant}} stakeholders were identified for each recommendation. A total of 213 barriers and 208 <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> identified. During the first analysis of <b>recommendations,</b> the <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> categorised {{in three different}} groups (recommendations regarding VRUs, vehicles and infrastructure). By means of grouping and additional analysis, the <b>recommendations</b> <b>were</b> merged and prioritised, resulting in {{a long list of}} 50 <b>recommendations.</b> A <b>recommendation</b> <b>was</b> included in the long list [8] if it scored high on the different criteria, such as having low implementation costs, being considered effective and concerning several motivated stakeholders.|$|R

25|$|A {{guideline}} for {{the appropriate}} amount of fat—a component of daily food consumption—is established by regulatory agencies like the Food and Drug Administration.

25|$|Louse eggs hatch 6–9 {{days after}} oviposition.

25|$|A fourth line {{is planned}} for the Athens Metro {{and it has been}} {{incorporated}} in the roadmap of Attica's mass transit system since 2005.

25|$|The European Broadcasting Union {{has been}} {{addressing}} {{this issue in}} the EBU PLOUD Group, which consist of over 240 audio professionals, many from broadcasters and equipment manufacturers.

The researchers also claim that the recommendations have been unduly influenced by the American dairy industry, and that whole milk may be better for health due to its increased ability to satiate hunger.|$|E
