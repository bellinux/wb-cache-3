40|$|For some decades, {{there has}} been a growing {{emphasis}} on the importance of intellectual property rights in general, and patents in particular, as a tool of economic strategy and competitiveness. More than 90 % of the patents granted in industrialized countries originate from employee inventors. This reality has prompted legislators in most European Member States to promulgate laws that regulate the matter of employee inventions. This paper aims, in a first part, at describing the characteristics of the legislative regime in several EU Member States. It is shown that, save for university inventions, the legislative landscape has not undergone fundamental changes during the past decades. In today’s globalized world economy the issue of employees’ inventions is, however, no longer a mere national issue. Also in Europe, more and more research takes place in a multinational setting and the transboundary effects of the currently diverging national solutions are important. Hence, the lack of harmonized European <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> of employee inventions is not only surprising but also unfortunate. The paper discusses some attempts that {{have been made in the}} past all of which have failed at an early stage. Possibly, because the issue of employee inventions is legally situated at the intersection between patent law and labour law, it revealed itself as too tricky to handle. The paper criticizes the current reticence demonstrated by the European legislator. The viewpoint that existing differences between member states' laws on employees' inventions are not likely to have an impact on innovation or on the conditions of competition seems short-sighted. The paper shows that a coherent regulatory framework that takes the trend towards Europeanization is not illusive and may have many benefits for intra-European relationships. It is argued that such a goal is feasible even though the specific details of the current statutes vary from Member State to Member State. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} {{conceived}} {{with the need}} (or lack thereof) for more uniform admission requirements and disciplinary processes in the federal courts. Basically, it surveys the background and literature and considers <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> and proposals relating to bar admissions and discipline in the federal courts. It also contains a Study Draft of <b>Rules</b> <b>Governing</b> Admissions and Discipline in Federal District Courts (Appendix A). The Study Draft proposals are designed to assure that there are <b>rules</b> explicitly <b>governing</b> <b>the</b> material <b>issues</b> considered in <b>the</b> report. At the same time, the Study Draft would leave to the local courts sufficient flexibility to allow local expression, thus minimizing the upset resulting from {{the adoption of the}} generally applicable rules. In addition, this study contains an analysis of all the local court rules (Appendix B) and the results of a survey questionnaire submitted to all judges in the federal system (Appendix C) ...|$|R
