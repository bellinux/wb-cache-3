2500|$|In {{cases where}} the post space {{is not a good}} match for a {{prefabricated}} post, a cast post and core can be custom fabricated for the tooth. [...] A resin pattern is produced by placing a preformed plastic [...] "burnout" [...] post into the post space [...] and a <b>resin</b> <b>material,</b> such as Duralay resin, is used to build up the tooth to the proper dimensions. [...] When this is completed, the pattern resin/plastic post is removed from the tooth structure and attached to a sprue former, much {{in the same way as}} a is done with the wax pattern of a crown, and a single-unit cast post and core can thus be fabricated out of gold, titanium or another metal using the lost-wax technique. Where a metal post could be difficult to conceal a custom post made of zirconia oxide can be made; its tooth colour leaves less of a shadow under the final restoration. Alternatively, an impression can be taken of the post space and dental arch [...] using a plastic post and a polyvinyl siloxane impression material, and this used to construct a suitable post in the dental laboratory.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} four <b>resin</b> <b>materials</b> on the shear bond strength (SBS) of a ceramic core material to dentin. Materials and Methods: Sixty molar teeth were embedded in a self‑curing acrylic resin. All specimens were randomly divided into four groups of teeth, each according to the resin cement used. Sixty cylinders were then luted {{with one of the}} four <b>resin</b> <b>materials</b> to dentin (GC EQUIA, Panavia F, Variolink II and Vertise). Then, specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 oC for one day. Shear bond strength of each specimen was measured using a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/minute. The bond strength values were calculated in N, and the results were statistically analyzed using a Kruskal–Wallis and Bonferroni corrected Mann–Whitney U tests. Results: The shear bond strength varied significantly depending on the <b>resin</b> <b>materials</b> used (P < 0. 05). The specimens luted with GC EQUIA showed the highest shear bond strength (25. 19 ± 6. 12), whereas, the specimens luted with Vertise flow (8. 1 ± 2. 75) and Panavia F (11. 17 ± 3. 89) showed the lowest. Conclusion: GC EQUIA material showed a higher shear bond strength value than other <b>resin</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} of the curing light greatly changed dentistry. Prior to the {{development of}} the dental curing light, different materials had to be used in order to have a resin based composite material placed in a tooth. The material used prior to this development was a self-curing <b>resin</b> <b>material.</b> These materials, an A material and a B material, were mixed separately before application. The A material was the base and the B material was the catalyst. This <b>resin</b> <b>material</b> was mixed first and then placed in the tooth. It is then self-cured/hardened fully after 30-60 seconds. This presented several issues to the dentist. One issue was that the dentist did not have control over how quick the material cured—once mixed the curing process started. This resulted in the dentist having to quickly and properly place the material in the tooth. If the material was not properly placed, then the material had to be excavated and the process started over again.|$|E
