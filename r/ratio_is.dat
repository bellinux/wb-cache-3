5|$|For atoms {{with low}} atomic numbers, a nucleus {{that has more}} {{neutrons}} than protons tends to drop to a lower energy state through radioactive decay so that the neutron–proton <b>ratio</b> <b>is</b> closer to one.

Thus, there are no stable nuclei with equal proton and neutron numbers above atomic number Z = 20 (calcium) and as Z increases, the neutron–proton ratio of stable isotopes increases. The stable isotope with the highest proton–neutron <b>ratio</b> <b>is</b> lead-208 (about 1.5).|$|E

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{contains a}} range of interesting compounds in small quantities, including some based on hydrogen, such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). There is carbon monoxide, water vapour and atomic oxygen as well. Hydrogen is in relatively short supply in the Venusian atmosphere. A large amount of the planet's hydrogen is theorised to have been lost to space, with the remainder being mostly bound up in sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The loss of significant amounts of hydrogen is proven by a very high D–H ratio measured in the Venusian atmosphere. The <b>ratio</b> <b>is</b> about 0.015–0.025, which is 100–150 {{times higher than the}} terrestrial value of 1.6.

5|$|The {{balance between}} the {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This <b>ratio</b> <b>is</b> {{an important component of}} what is called the redox state of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the <b>ratio</b> <b>is</b> thus favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH <b>ratio</b> <b>is</b> normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.|$|E

30|$|Prediction 4 {{stated that}} drops in women’s couple {{formation}} resulting from CLM would be larger in low sex ratio states than in high sex ratio states. It {{can be seen}} from rows 3 and 4 in Table  5 that the coefficient of CLM is negative in most regressions for both women and men when sex <b>ratios</b> <b>are</b> low, the only exception being that CLM does not affect women’s likelihood of cohabitation when sex <b>ratios</b> <b>are</b> low. In contrast, CLM effects on likelihood of in-couple residence and likelihood of marriage are zero when sex <b>ratios</b> <b>are</b> high. This is consistent with what we argued: where sex <b>ratios</b> <b>are</b> low, CLM potentially boosts the price of women’s WiHo, but not where sex <b>ratios</b> <b>are</b> high.

5|$|The {{most common}} {{approach}} of GWA studies is the case-control setup, which compares two {{large groups of}} individuals, one healthy control group and one case group affected by a disease. All individuals in each group are genotyped {{for the majority of}} common known SNPs. The exact number of SNPs depends on the genotyping technology, but are typically one million or more. For each of these SNPs it is then investigated if the allele frequency is significantly altered between the case and the control group. In such setups, the fundamental unit for reporting effect sizes is the odds ratio. The odds <b>ratio</b> <b>is</b> the ratio of two odds, which in the context of GWA studies are the odds of disease for individuals having a specific allele and the odds of disease for individuals who do not have that same allele. When the allele frequency in the case group is much higher than in the control group, the odds <b>ratio</b> <b>is</b> higher than 1, and vice versa for lower allele frequency. Additionally, a P-value for the significance of the odds <b>ratio</b> <b>is</b> typically calculated using a simple chi-squared test. Finding odds ratios that are significantly different from 1 is the objective of the GWA study because this shows that a SNP is associated with disease.|$|E

In previous reports, the CRP/ALB <b>ratio</b> <b>was</b> shown to have an outstanding prognostic value in comparison to other established inflammation-based prognostic markers (Kinoshita et al. 2015; Xu et al. 2015).
