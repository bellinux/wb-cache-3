In fact, Tesnire's grammatical ideas, and among them, the most original ones, fit well to Japanese as they give simple and insightful descriptions of some usually controversial gram- matical phenomena (ergative constructions, haadjectives).

This typical East Asian "laurel forest" is dominated by evergreen Fagaceae, Lauraceae, Theaceae, etc., despite winter monthly mean temperatures which approach freezing. Forest vegetation, including a deciduous ravine forest, were sampled by Braun-Blanquet <b>relevs</b> for comparison with potentially similar forests in other parts of East Asia and eastern North America.

40|$|Construction of {{potential}} natural vegetation (PNV) poses particular challenges in landscapes heavily altered by human activity {{and must be}} based on transparent, repeatable methods. We integrated the concept of ancient forest (AF) and ancient forest species (AFS) into a four-step procedure of PNV mapping: 1) classification of forest vegetation relev,s; 2) selection of those vegetation types that can serve as PNV units, based on AF and AFS; 3) merging of selected vegetation types into five PNV units that can be predicted from a digital morphogenetic soil map; 4) mapping of three additional PNV units based on additional environmental data. The second step, concerning the selection of reference forest vegetation, is of particular interest for PNV construction in Flanders (northern Belgium), where forest cover has been subject to temporal disruption and spatial fragmentation. Among the variety of extant forest recovery states, we chose as PNV units those vegetation types for which a high proportion of <b>relev,s</b> had been located in AF and that contained many AFS. As the frequency of AFS depends on site conditions, we only compared and selected vegetation types that are found on similar sites according to average Ellenberg indicator values. While succession is irrelevant for the definition of PNV, colonization rates of AFS can be used to estimate the time required for PNV to be restored in a site...|$|R

40|$|Many natural {{language}} researchers are currently turning {{their attention to}} treebank development and trying to achieve accuracy and corpus data coverage in their representation formats. This paper presents a data-driven annotation schema developed for an Italian treebank ensuring data coverage and consistency between annotation of linguistic phenomena. The schema is a dependency-based format centered upon the notion of predicate-argument structure augmented with traces to represent discontinuous constituents. The treebank development involves an annotation process performed by a human annotator helped by an interactive parsing tool that builds incrementally syntactic representation of the sentence. To increase the syntactic knowledge of this parser, a specific data-driven strategy has been applied. We describe the cyclical development of the annotation schema highlighting the richness and flexibility of the format, and we present some representational issues. 1.

The study had also the applied goal: to estimate the chances of "special care" species to survive in the changing environment without management regime for the maintenance of grassland. The model object was the island population of large-leaved ragwort on Biała Góra (the White Mountain) near Tomaszów Lubelski, South-East Poland. To achieve these aims I used the following sets of data: phytosociological <b>relev,s</b> made in plant communities in an interval of 16 - 18 years; repeated elaboration of the numbers and life-stage structure of the population, both by non-surface and surface method; observation of plants, life cycle in 50 labelled genets; population reproduction and seed rain amounts. The area of an open xerothermic grassland decreased due to the process of overgrowing by bushes which was accompanied by the increasing coverage of forest and meadow herbs as well as monocotyledons, mainly Brachypodium pinnatum and Calamagrostis epigejos. The abundance of the S. macrophyllus population noticable diminished.

40|$|Biodiversity {{pattern and}} {{life-form}} spectra were studied along a 3, 000 m altitudinal gradient from a semi-desert {{area to the}} alpine peak of Tochal Mountain. The gradient {{is located on the}} southern slopes of Central Alborz with a Mediterranean continental climate. DCA ordination was applied to 1, 069 <b>relev,s</b> and 7 quantitative variables to discover the relation of diversity and altitude. A biodiversity pattern was obtained by relating values for species richness and Shannon-Wiener's index to 100 -m altitudinal sections. Altitude was determined as the major ecological gradient. Both diversity indices are negatively correlated with altitude and show a decreasing trend beyond a peak in species richness at 1, 800 - 1, 900 m a. s. l. towards a very low diversity in the high alpine zone. The biodiversity peak does not match with the potential tree line in the area (2, 500 - 3, 000 m a. s. l.). The high diversity in foothills can be related to habitat heterogeneity, longer suitable climatic conditions, and diverse disturbance factors, while unfavorable conditions at high-altitude alpine and low-altitude desert areas reduce the number of species at both extremes. Life-form patterns clearly change along altitudinal gradient. Annuals with decreasing trend, and hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes with increasing trend along the altitudinal gradient are notable patterns of life form in the area. Temperature, soil moisture and nutrients are the main factors that explain the ecological influence of altitude on species diversity and life-form patterns in the semi-arid steppe vegetation of the area. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is the development of a micromechanically based probabilistic model for the assessment of the cleavage fracture probability of ferritic steels. Brittle fracture of ferritic steels is a probabilistic process, triggered by the failure of randomly distributed brittle particles. These particles fracture due to plastic deformation of the surrounding matrix, resulting in the nucleation of micro-cracks. Once nucleated, the local stress state controls the possible instability of the defects. In this context, the local stress-triaxiality is assumed to govern the blunting of freshly nucleated micro-defects. The local approach models available in literature account for the above-mentioned correlations only in a simplified manner. Based on Representative Volume Elements (RVE) of the microstructure, accounting for the grain-structure {{as well as for the}} brittle particles, the cleavage initiation process was modelled in order to investigate the <b>relev</b> ant parameters and their interactions.

MODIS time series metrics of the growing season 2004 / 2005 were used to classify Kalahari vegetation types using a tree-based ensemble classifier (Random Forest). The prevailing Kalahari vegetation types based on LCCS was open broadleaved deciduous shrubland with an herbaceous layer which differs from the class assignments of the global and regional land-cover maps. The separability analysis based on Bhattacharya distance measurements applied on two LCCS levels indicated a relationship of spectral mapping dependencies of annual MODIS time series features due to the thematic detail of the classification scheme.

A Widespread Activity The discussion of fakes in art is dominated by the legal and by the art history points of view. Lawyers tend to look at fakes in terms of forgery and counterfeiting and therefore as fraud to be prohibited. Art historians emphasize the uniqueness or "aura" of the original work which has to be specially protected against imitation. This paper employs the economic point of view 1 to consider fakes. Its analysis and conclusions differ substantially from the legal and art historic approaches which both tend to have a negative attitude to imitations, and often suggest a repressive policy. Therefore, on purpose I do not distinguish between the various terms used in this context (copies, forgeries, fakes, imitations, counterfeit) because they are often not <b>relev</b> [...] ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate POPs burden, and its determinants, in a population at high risk of suffering CVD enrolled in the PREDIMED Study (Spanish acronym for PREvention by means of MEDiterranean Diet). This cohort was formed by 343 participants (55 – 80 y. o.), which were selected for a preventive nutritional intervention for CVD based on the Mediterranean Diet. Relevant information on demographic, behavioral, dietary, and socioeconomic characteristics was obtained from each participant through a specific questionnaire, and their anthropometric and clinical measurements were recorded. In addition, the levels of 35 POPs were determined in serum samples taken before the beginning of the nutritional intervention. All the samples showed detectable levels of, at least, one POP, being DDT-derivatives and marker-PCBs the most frequently detected compounds. Our results showed that people at high risk for CVD showed a higher level of contamination by POPs as compared to other studies done in cohorts of Western people at no special risk of CVD. Although educational level seems to be a relevant determinant for POPs burden in our population, the main determining factor seems to be the diet. Thus, while the intake of food of animal origin was significantly associated with levels of PCBs, especially in men, the intake of vegetal-origin food was positively related to levels of organochlorine pesticides, indicating a different dietary source for these two groups of chemicals. Our results showing that subjects at high risk for cardiovascular disease present elevated POPs burden might have a <b>relev...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{method is}} {{based only on}} tlotistical data and nevertheless classifies the relev&eacute;s into ecological groupings, corresponding to as similar environments as possible. It begins by calibrating the behaviour of each plant along a large gradient, in a national data bank of floristical releves, {{on the scale of}} France, the bank Sophy. It calibrates the behaviour of a plant by its fidelities to the 5, 626 other plants of the bank, which are considered as indices of the environment. &nbsp;It defines a statistical space having 5. 626 dimensions in which: 1) an axis measures the fidelity to a plant, considered as an ecological index; 2) a dot corresponds to the behaviour of a plant towards the indices; 3) the distance between two dots expresses the ecological difference between two behaviours; 4) the centre of gravity for the plants of a releve indicates the probable position of the <b>relev</b> 6; 5) the distance between two releves expresses their ecological difference. Compared with this method, the correspondence factor analysis CFA: 1) locates the releves in a space, according to the fidelities of plants to releves, showing their floristical differences; 2) gives a weight to a plant according to its rarity, not its ecological behaviour; 3) deals only with subsets of the releves and rehandle the subsets by successive approximations; 4) transfers onto the graphs the empirical and intuitive method of a naturalist during field-work, The method is applied to about 400 releves in a district in the Northern Vosges (France). It generates an automatic classification of the releves, at several levels of synthesis. including the upper levels above the phytosociological classes. It explains half of the peculiarity of a type of plant community with 10 to 30 discriminant plants, which are the quantitative and gradual homologues of characteristic species...|$|E
