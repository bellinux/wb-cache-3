50|$|Biological {{weighting}} {{factors have been}} used in all of the recent clinical trials in patients with high grade gliomas, using boronophenylalanine (BPA) in combination with an epithermal neutron beam. The 10B(n,α)7Li component of the radiation dose to the scalp has been based on the measured boron concentration in the blood at the time of BNCT, assuming a blood: scalp boron concentration ratio of 1.5:1 and a compound biological effectiveness (CBE) factor for BPA in skin of 2.5. A relative biological effectiveness (<b>RBE)</b> <b>factor</b> of 3.2 has been used in all tissues for the high LET components of the beam, such as alpha particles. The <b>RBE</b> <b>factor</b> is used to compare the biologic effectiveness of different types of ionizing radiation. The high LET components include protons resulting from the capture reaction with normal tissue nitrogen, and recoil protons resulting from the collision of fast neutrons with hydrogen. It must be emphasized that the tissue distribution of the boron delivery agent in humans should be similar to that in the experimental animal model in order to use the experimentally derived values for estimation of the radiation doses for clinical radiations. For more detailed information relating to computational dosimetry and treatment planning, interested readers are referred to a comprehensive review on this subject.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} the rem first {{appeared}} in the literature in 1945, and was given its first definition in 1947. The definition was refined in 1950 as [...] "that dose of any ionizing radiation which produces a relevant biological effect equal to that produced by one roentgen of high-voltage x-radiation." [...] This definition left open the question of what might be considered a [...] "relevant biological effect," [...] and did not prescribe if the roentgen should be measured in air, water, or tissue. Using data available at the time, the rem was variously evaluated as 83, 93, or 95 erg/gram. Along with the introduction of the rad in 1953, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) decided to [...] "continue" [...] the use of the rem. The US National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements noted in 1954 that this effectively implied an increase in the magnitude of the rem to match the rad (100 erg/gram). The ICRP officially adopted the rem as the unit of equivalent dose in 1962 to measure the way different types of radiation distribute energy in tissue, and began recommending values of relative biological effectiveness (RBE) for various types of radiation. In practice, the unit of rem was used to denote that an <b>RBE</b> <b>factor</b> had been applied to a number which was originally in units of rad or roentgen. In 1977 the rem was redefined by the ICRP as 0.01 sievert or 0.01 J/kg, with the intention that the sievert would come to replace the rem.|$|E

40|$|Around the world, {{the use of}} protons as an {{alternative}} to photons radiation therapy of cancer is becoming more widespread. The motivations for this is that protons enable a reduction of the radiation dose to health tissue or increase the dose to the tumor when compared to photons. However, there is currently an uncertainty related to the biological effectiveness of protons. Protons are known to be slightly more efficient in cell inactivation then photons, and this can be taken into account by applying a scaling factor for the proton dose. The scaling factor is known as the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) and in current clinical practice a constant <b>RBE</b> <b>factor</b> of 1. 1 is applied. However, several studies including data from cell irradiation experiments suggest that a variable <b>RBE</b> <b>factor</b> is more appropriate. The primary objective of this project was to calculate and compare the dose-to-patient results of constant RBE versus variable RBE calculated by different models for protons. The calculations were done by a combination of FLUKA Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and post-processing using custom scrips written in Python. CT images and treatment plan information for a medulloblastoma patient was imported into FLUKA, where the dose and linear energy transfer (LET) was calculated. The RBE values were subsequently calculated for four different models, assuming constant tissue parameters. An in-depth investigation of the different model properties was performed by systematically varying the model parameters. RBE calculations with a simple treatment plan on a water phantom were also performed. The models consistently predicted an equal or lower dose in the beam-entrance region compared to predictions for RBE = 1. 1 (RBE 1. 1) while greatly exceeding the predicted RBE 1. 1 dose in the distal part of the PTV and in the distal dose-falloff. There was also a considerable increase in dose distributed in the lateral direction for the PTV. The dose volume histograms (DVHs) revealed that structures/OARs located in close proximity to the PTV receive considerably higher levels of dose than predicted by RBE 1. 1 due to a high <b>RBE</b> <b>factor,</b> at times double that of the constant RBE. The RBE models also show a strong dependence on dose. The models appear to be largely in agreement, and the mean RBE varies about 1. 4 % in the PTV. However, the mean RBE variation increases at lower doses, such as in the esophagus with 6. 3 % variation. For a prescribed dose of 23. 4 Gy to the PTV, the mean dose to the PTV varied between 24. 9 and 25. 7 for the different models, while for the lungs and esophagus the mean dose varied between 3. 79 - 4. 03 and 10. 2 - 11. 5, respectively. The results show that while the models do have differences, they consistently deviate from the dose predicted using RBE of 1. 1. For the investigated patient case RBE values from 1. 1 to 1. 4 were seen for the target volume, while similar and higher RBE values were also observed for several healthy tissues, and this could be of clinical relevance. This leads to the conclusion that implementing a variable RBE into clinical scenarios should be considered. At least, practitioners should use the results provided by MC as guidance for assessing the dose until more experimental data and accurate models becomes available...|$|E
30|$|The {{macroscale}} dosimetry calculations {{suggest a}} tolerable administered activity of 38  kBq, which would yield a 5.3 -Gy tumor absorbed dose. The organ and tumor absorbed doses were calculated without {{accounting for the}} microscale dosimetry. Given the relatively uniform microscale distribution of activity within the liver at each time point, we expect from macroscale dosimetry calculations that the liver will be the dose-limiting organ. At 37  kBq and above (i.e., at the liver toxicity threshold of 28 to 32  Gy), significant liver toxicity was noted, including {{a significant reduction in}} liver mass and weight loss. In this case, the macroscopic absorbed dose calculation is consistent with the observed MTD. However, the activity distribution in the spleen and thymus was highly non-uniform; correspondingly, only the highest administered activity led to a significant reduction in spleen weight, and the thymus seemed to be insensitive to administered activity. The threshold for renal toxicity occurs at 18 to 23  Gy which corresponds to 130 to 170  kBq administered activity. As is evident from EMS. 8, renal toxicity as indicated by mass reduction occurs at far lower administered activities. This again highlights the importance of dosimetry calculations that account for the microscopic localization of alpha-particle emitters. In the case of kidneys, 63 % of the absorbed dose is due to free 213 Bi, which is predominantly localized in the renal cortex [42]. It {{should be noted that the}} absorbed dose values reported herein were not multiplied by a relative biological effectiveness (<b>RBE)</b> <b>factor.</b> A Department of Energy workshop on alpha-particle emitter therapy recommended an RBE of 5 pending the collection of additional data to identify the most appropriate RBE [43]. Preclinical measurements of RBE range from 1 to 14 [44]. Given the wide variability and lack of consistency in RBE values, we have chosen to report all doses as absorbed dose with the unit gray.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{prediction}} {{of the risks}} of cancer and other late effects from space radiation exposure carries large uncertainties mostly {{due to the lack}} of information on the risks from high charge and energy (HZE) particles and other high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation. In our recent work new methods were used to consider NASA's requirement to protect against the acceptable risk of no more than 3 % probability of cancer fatality estimated at the 95 % confidence level. Because it is not possible that a zero-level of uncertainty could be achieved, we suggest that an acceptable uncertainty level should be defined in relationship to a probability distribution function (PDF) that only suffers from modest skewness with higher uncertainty allowed for a normal PDF. In this paper, we evaluate PDFs and the number or “safe days” in space, which are defined as the mission length where risk limits are not exceeded, for several mission scenarios at different acceptable levels of uncertainty. In addition, we briefly discuss several important issues in risk assessment including non-cancer effects, the distinct tumor spectra and lethality found in animal experiments for HZE particles compared to background or low LET radiation associated tumors, and the possibility of non-targeted effects (NTE) modifying low dose responses and increasing relative biological effectiveness (<b>RBE)</b> <b>factors</b> for tumor induction. Each of these issues skew uncertainty distributions to higher fatality probabilities with the potential to increase central values of risk estimates in the future. Therefore they will require significant research efforts to support space exploration within acceptable levels of risk and uncertainty...|$|R

40|$|Yields of {{chromosome}} aberrations {{were assessed}} in cells deficient in DNA doublestrand break (DSB) repair, after exposure to acute or to low-dose-rate (0. 018 Gy/hr) gamma rays or acute high LET iron nuclei. We studied several cell lines including fibroblasts deficient in ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated; {{product of the}} gene that is mutated in ataxia telangiectasia patients) or NBS (nibrin; product of the gene mutated in the Nijmegen breakage syndrome), and gliomablastoma cells that are proficient or lacking in DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) activity. Chromosomes were analyzed using the {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) chromosome painting method in cells at the first division post irradiation, and chromosome aberrations were identified as either simple exchanges (translocations and dicentrics) or complex exchanges (involving > 2 breaks in 2 or more chromosomes). Gamma irradiation induced greater yields of both simple and complex exchanges in the DSB repair-defective cells than in the normal cells. The quadratic dose-response terms for both simple and complex chromosome exchanges were significantly higher for the ATM- and NBS-deficient lines than for normal fibroblasts. However, in the NBS cells the linear dose-response term was significantly higher only for simple exchanges. The large increases in the quadratic dose-response terms in these repair-defective cell lines points the importance of the functions of ATM and NBS in chromatin modifications to facilitate correct DSB repair and minimize the formation of aberrations. The differences found between ATM- and NBS-deficient cells at low doses suggest that important questions should with regard to applying observations of radiation sensitivity at high dose to low-dose exposures. For aberrations induced by iron nuclei, regression models preferred purely linear dose responses for simple exchanges and quadratic dose responses for complex exchanges. Relative biological effectiveness (<b>RBE)</b> <b>factors</b> of all of the DNA repair-defective cell lines were smaller than those of normal cells, with the DNA-PK-deficient cells having RBEs near unity.

A review is offered in which measured radiation effects and known tissue properties are combined to estimate on the one hand, the number of cells at risk, p 3 n, per track, where n is the number of cells per track based on tissue and organ geometry, and p 3 is the probability that a cell in the track is capable of expressing the experimental end-point. On the other hand, the tissue and single-cell responses are compared by determining the ratio RBE in tissue/RBE in corresponding single cells.

40|$|International audienceAquatic {{ecosystems}} are chronically exposed to natural radioactivity or to artificial radionuclides released by human activities (e. g., nuclear medicine and biology,nuclear industry, military applications). Should {{the nuclear industry}} expand in the future, radioactive environmental releases, under normal operating conditions or accidental ones, are expected to increase, which raises public concerns about possible consequences {{on the environment and}} human health. Radionuclide exposures may drive macromolecule alterations, and among macromolecules DNA is the major target for ionizing radiations. DNA damage, if not correctly repaired, may induce mutations, teratogenesis, and reproductive effects. As such, damage at the molecular level may have consequences at the population level. In this review, we present an overview of the literature dealing with the effects of radionuclides on DNA, development, and reproduction of aquatic organisms. The review focuses on the main radionuclides that are released by nuclear power plants under normal operating conditions, γ emitters and tritium. Additionally, we fitted nonlinear curves to the dose-response data provided in the reviewed publications and manuscripts, and thus obtained endpoints commonly associated with ecotoxicological studies, such as the EDR(10). These were then used as a common metric for comparing the values and data published in the literature. The effects of tritium on aquatic organisms were reviewed for dose rates that ranged from 29 nGy/day to 29 Gy/day. Although beta emission from tritium decay presents a rather special risk of damage to DNA, genotoxicity-induced by tritium has been scarcely studied. Most of the effects studied have related to reproduction and development. Species sensitivity and the form of tritium present are important factors that drive the ecotoxicity of tritium. We have concluded from this review that invertebrates are more sensitive to the effects of tritium than are vertebrates. Because several calculated EDR 10 values are ten times lower than background levels of γ irradiation the results of some studies either markedly call into question the adequacy of the benchmark value of 0. 24 mGy/day for aquatic ecosystems that was recommended by Garnier-Laplace et al. (2006), or the dose rate estimates made in the original research, from which our EDR(10) values were derived, were under estimated, or were inadequate. For γ irradiation, the effects of several different dose rates on aquatic organisms were reviewed, and these ranged from 1 mGy/day to 18 Gy/day. DNA damage from exposure to y irradiation was studied more often than for tritium, but the major part of the literature addressed effects on reproduction and development. These data sets support the benchmark value of 0. 24 mGy/day, which is recommended to protect aquatic ecosystems. RBEs, that describe the relative effectiveness of different radiation types to produce the same biological effect, were calculated using the available datasets. These RBE values ranged from 0. 06 to 14. 9, depending on the biological effect studied, and they had a mean of 3. 1 ± 3. 7 (standard deviation). This value is similar to the <b>RBE</b> <b>factors</b> of 2 - 3 recommended by international organizations responsible for providing guidance on radiation safety. Many knowledge gaps remain relative to the biological effects produced from exposure to tritium and y emitters. Among these are: Dose calculations: this review highlights several EDR(10) values that are below the normal range of background radiation. One explanation for this result is that dose rates were underestimated from uncertainties linked to the heterogenous distribution of tritium in cells. Therefore, the reliability of the concept of average dose to organisms must be addressed. Mechanisms of DNA DBS repair: very few studies address the most deleterious form of DNA damage, which are DNA DBSs. Future studies should focus on identifying impaired DNA DBS repair pathways and kinetics, in combination with developmental and reproductive effects. The transmission of genetic damage to offspring, which is of primary concern in the human health arena. However, there has been little work undertaken to assess the potential risk from germ cell mutagens in aquatic organisms, although {{this is one of the}} means of extrapolating effects from subcellular levels to populations. Reproductive behavior that is linked to alterations of endocrine function. Despite the importance of reproduction for population dynamics, many key endpoints were scarcely addressed within this topic. Hence, there is, to our knowledge,only one study of courtship behavior in fish exposed to γ rays, while no studies of radionuclide effects on fish endocrine function exist. Recent technical advances in the field of endocrine disrupters can be used to assess the direct or indirect effects of radionuclides on endocrine function. Identifying whether resistance to radiation effects in the field result from adaptation or acclimation mechanisms. Organisms may develop resistance to the toxic effects of high concentrations of radionuclides. Adaptation occurs at the population level by genetic selection for more resistant organisms. To date, very few field studies exist in which adaptation has been addressed, despite the fact that it represents an unknown influence on observed biological responses...|$|R

The mixed radiation field produced during BNCT comprises radiations with different linear energy transfer (LET) and different relative biological effectiveness (RBE). The short ranges of the two high-LET products of the `B(n,a) `Li reaction make the microdistribution of the boron relative to target cell nuclei of particular importance. Due to the tissue specific distribution of different boron compounds, the term RBE is inappropriate in defining the biological effectiveness of the {sup 10 }B(n,{alpha}) {sup 7 }Li reaction.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The proposed conversion method {{is based on a}} simulation of the fixed spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) depth dose profiles as used for the irradiation at HIMAC by LEM/TRiP 98 and a recalculation of the resulting RBE-weighted dose distribution. We present data according to the clinical studies conducted at GSI in the past decade (LEM I), as well as data used in current studies (refined LEM version: LEM IV). RESULTS: We found conversion factors (RBE-weighted dose LEM/RBE-weighted dose HIMAC) reaching from 0. 4 to 2. 0 for prescribed carbon ion doses from 1 to 60 Gy (RBE) for SOBP extensions ranging from 20 to 120 mm according to the HIMAC approach. A conversion factor of 1. 0 was found for approximately 5 Gy (<b>RBE).</b> The conversion <b>factor</b> decreases with increasing prescribed dose. Slightly smaller values for the LEM IV-based data set compared with LEM I were found. A significant dependence of the conversion factor from the SOBP width could be observed in particular for LEM IV, whereas the depth dependence was found to be small. CONCLUSIONS: For the interpretation and comparison of clinical trials performed at HIMAC and GSI/HIT, it is of extreme importance to consider these conversion factors because according to the various methods to determine the RBE-weighted dose, similar dose values might not necessarily be related to similar clinical outcomes...|$|R

The computed distribution of the PET emitters in a PMMA Phantom irradiated by neon ions shows good agreement with experimental data ftrom the GSI laboratory. ConclusionsCurrently, the SHIELD-HIT Monte Carlo code {{is one of the most}} accurate ion transport codes, suitable for ion therapy purposes. Based on numerous comparisons with experimental data, this code predicts adequately ion energy deposition along the whole track including the Bragg peak. It is concluded that a careful analysis of stopping power data is necessary for radiotherapy applications, since an incorrect estimation of the position of the Bragg peak might lead to a significant deviation from the prescribed dose in small target volumes...|$|R
40|$|When {{reporting}} {{radiation therapy}} procedures, International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) recommends specifying absorbed dose at/in all clinically relevant points and/or volumes. In addition, treatment conditions should be reported as completely {{as possible in}} order to allow full understanding and interpretation of the treatment prescription. However, the clinical outcome does not only depend on absorbed dose but also on a number of other factors such as dose per fraction, overall treatment time and radiation quality radiation biology effectiveness (<b>RBE).</b> Therefore, weighting <b>factors</b> have to be applied when different types of treatments are to be compared or to be combined. This had led to the concept of 'isoeffective absorbed dose', introduced by ICRU and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The isoeffective dose D IsoE is the dose of a treatment carried out under reference conditions producing the same clinical effects on the target volume as those of the actual treatment. It is the product of the total absorbed dose (in gray) used and a weighting factor W IsoE (dimensionless) : D IsoE =D 3 WIsoE. In fractionated photon-beam therapy, the dose per fraction and the overall treatment time (in days) are the two main parameters that the radiation oncologist has the freedom to adjust. The weighting factor for an alteration of the dose per fraction is commonly evaluated using the linear-quadratic (α/β) model. For therapy with protons and heavier ions, radiation quality has to be taken into account. A 'generic proton RBE' of 1. 1 for clinical applications is recommended in a joint ICRU-IAEA Report [ICRU (International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements) and IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency). Prescribing, recording and reporting proton-beam therapy. ICRU Report 78, jointly with the IAEA, JICRU, 7 (2) Oxford University Press (2007) ]. For heavier ions (e. g. carbon ions), the situation is more complex as the RBE values vary markedly with particle type, energy and depth in tissue. © The Author 2010.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) of 8 fast-neutron beams, 5 proton {{beams and}} 1 carbonion beam was {{determined}} using as biological criterion intestinal crypt regeneration in mice, i. e. an in vivo system. These beams are used or planned for clinical cancer therapy applications. In addition, the RBE of 6 epithermal neutron beams, used or planned for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT), was determined; no boron was administered. The {{goal of the}} program was to improve the exchange of information between the centers, facilitate the interpretation of the results and increase the safety of the clinical applications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In all visited centers, the same technique was applied in the same conditions by the same radiobiology team. The number of regenerating crypts per circumference was scored 3. 5 days after single fraction total body irradiation. The control irradiations were performed locally using cobalt- 60 units. The mice were randomized according to radiation quality and dose level. RESULTS: (1) For fast neutron beams, the RBE (Ref. cobalt- 60 gamma rays) increases with decreasing energy (from approximately 1. 7 for p(65) +Be neutrons to approximately 2. 4 for d(14. 5) +Be neutrons). In addition, it is specific to each facility and depends on the nuclear reaction (p or d + Be), target and collimation type. (2) For proton beams, the RBEs (Ref cobalt- 60 gamma rays) at the reference position (middle of a 7 -cm Spread Out Bragg Peak, SOBP) range between 1. 08 and 1. 18. They might differ by approximately 6 - 8 % according to the mode of beam production or delivery. The RBEs {{at the end of the}} SOBP are always 5 - 10 % higher than at the middle of the SOBP. (3) For the carbon ion beam studied at NIRS in Chiba, Japan, the RBE significantly increases with depth. Relative to gamma rays, it ranges from 1. 3 in the initial plateau, 1. 6 at the beginning, 1. 7 at the middle and 1. 9 at the end of a 6 -cm SOBP. 4) In BNCT beams, the radiation quality (in particular the relative contribution of the different dose components) varies rapidly with depth and depends strongly on the arrangement of the irradiation set-up (e. g. presence or not of back scattering material). Moreover, the (total) dose rates are highly variable (from 0. 05 to approximately 0. 5 Gy/min) according to the power of the reactors. Wide range of RBE values (Ref. gamma rays) was thus obtained (RBE = 1. 4 - 2. 2) at shallow depths of 1. 5 - 2. 5 cm. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Intestinal crypt regeneration in mice is an in vivo system perfectly suitable to perform intercomparisons between centers applying different types of non-conventional radiation qualities. It was proven to be reproducible, reliable and accurate, and becomes progressively recognized worldwide as part of the Quality Control (QA) procedures for new beams. It should be stressed that the observed RBE for intestinal crypt cells after a single high dose provide some radiobiological characterization of the radiation quality but cannot be used as the <b>RBE</b> weighting <b>factor</b> in clinical prescriptions...|$|R
40|$|Introduction {{of heavy}} {{particles}} (hadrons) into radiation therapy aims at improving the physical selectivity of the irradiation (e. g. proton beams), or the radiobiological differential effect (e. g. fast neutrons), or both (e. g. heavy-ion beams). Each {{of these new}} therapy modalities requires several types of information before prescribing safely the doses to patients, {{as well as for}} recording and reporting the treatments: (i) absorbed dose measured in a homogeneous phantom in reference conditions; (ii) dose distribution computed {{at the level of the}} target volume(s) and the normal tissues at risk; (iii) radiation quality from which a RBE evaluation could be predicted and (iv) RBE measured on biological systems or derived from clinical observation. In hadron therapy, the RBE of the different beams raises specific problems. For fast neutrons, the RBE varies within wide limits (about 2 to 5) depending on the neutron energy spectrum, dose, and biological system. For protons, the RBE values range between smaller limits (about 1. 0 to 1. 2). A clinical benefit can thus not be expected from RBE differences. However, the proton RBE problem cannot be ignored since dose differences of about 5 % can be detected clinically in some cases. The situation is most complex with heavy ions since RBE variations are at least as large as for fast neutrons, as a function of particle type and energy, dose and biological system. In addition, RBE varies with depth. Radiation quality thus has to be taken into account when prescribing and reporting a treatment. This can be done in different ways: (a) description of the method of beam production; (b) computed LET spectra and/or measured microdosimetric spectra at the points clinically relevant; (c) RBE determination. The most relevant RBE data are those obtained for late tolerance of normal tissues at 2 Gy per fraction ("reference RBE"). The "clinical RBE" selected by the radiation oncologist when prescribing the treatment will be close to the reference <b>RBE,</b> but other <b>factors</b> (such as heterogeneity in dose distribution) may influence the selection of the clinical RBE. Combination of microdosimetric data and experimental RBE values improves the confidence in both sets of data...|$|R

The ICRU has published recommendations for fast neutrons and a similar report is in preparation for proton beams. These recommendations are now universally applied. The single beam isodoses and thus the dose distributions are similar in neutron and photon therapy. Similar algorithms can then be used for treatment planning and the same rules can be followed for dose specification for prescribing and reporting a treatment In hadron therapy, the RBE of the different beams raises specific problems.

40|$|The {{risks of}} late effects from {{galactic cosmic rays}} (GCR) and solar {{particle}} events (SPE) are potentially a limitation to long-term space travel. The late effects of highest concern have significant lethality including cancer, effects to {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), and circulatory diseases (CD). For cancer and CD the use of age and gender specific models with uncertainty assessments based on human epidemiology data for low LET radiation combined with relative biological effectiveness <b>factors</b> (<b>RBEs)</b> and dose- and dose-rate reduction effectiveness factors (DDREF) to extrapolate these results to space radiation exposures is considered the current "state-of-the-art". The revised NASA Space Risk Model (NSRM- 2014) is based on recent radio-epidemiology data for cancer and CD, however a key feature of the NSRM- 2014 is the formulation of particle fluence and track structure based radiation quality factors for solid cancer and leukemia risk estimates, which are distinct from the ICRP quality factors, and shown to lead to smaller uncertainties in risk estimates. Many persons exposed to radiation on earth as well as astronauts are life-time never-smokers, which is estimated to significantly modify radiation cancer and CD risk estimates. A key feature of the NASA radiation protection model is the classification of radiation workers by smoking history in setting dose limits. Possible qualitative differences between GCR and low LET radiation increase uncertainties and are not included in previous risk estimates. Two important qualitative differences are emerging from research studies. The first is the increased lethality of tumors observed in animal models compared to low LET radiation or background tumors. The second are Non- Targeted Effects (NTE), which include bystander effects and genomic instability, which has been observed in cell and animal models of cancer risks. NTE's could lead to significant changes in RBE and DDREF estimates for GCR particles, and the potential effectiveness of radiation mitigator's. The NSRM- 2014 approaches to model radiation quality dependent lethality and NTE's will be described. CNS effects include both early changes that may occur during long space missions and late effects such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD effects 50 % of the population above age 80 -yr, is a degenerative disease that worsens with time after initial onset leading to death, and has no known cure. AD is difficult to detect at early stages and the small number of low LET epidemiology studies undertaken have not identified an association with low dose radiation. However experimental studies in mice suggest GCR may lead to early onset AD. We discuss modeling approaches to consider mechanisms whereby radiation would lead to earlier onset of occurrence of AD. Biomarkers of AD include amyloid beta (A(Beta)) plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) made up of aggregates of the hyperphosphorylated form of the micro-tubule associated, tau protein. Related markers include synaptic degeneration, dentritic spine loss, and neuronal cell loss through apoptosis. Radiation may affect these processes by causing oxidative stress, aberrant signaling following DNA damage, and chronic neuroinflammation. Cell types to be considered in multi-scale models are neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. We developed biochemical and cell kinetics models of DNA damage signaling related to glycogen synthase kinase- 3 (Beta) (GSK 3 (Beta)) and neuroinflammation, and considered multi-scale modeling approaches to develop computer simulations of cell interactions and their relationships to A(Beta) plaques and NFTs. Comparison of model results to experimental data for the age specific development of A(Beta) plaques in transgenic mice will be discussed...|$|R
