5|$|Construction {{began in}} September 2012 and took roughly eight months to complete. The park {{built a new}} {{entrance}} plaza featuring the keyhole towers as the centerpiece. The <b>roller</b> coaster replaced Disaster Transport and Space Spiral, both demolished {{during the summer of}} 2012, bringing Cedar Point back to its former total of 16 <b>roller</b> coasters. It was Cedar Point's first new <b>roller</b> coaster since Maverick debuted in 2007, and the third B coaster in the park following Raptor (1994) and Mantis (1996). In 2013, GateKeeper was the most frequently-ridden <b>roller</b> coaster at Cedar Point, and it ranked 28th among steel <b>roller</b> coasters in the annual Golden Ticket Awards poll from Amusement Today.|$|E

40|$|This article {{describes}} an end-effector and {{a method for}} manipulating deformable objects with undefined shapes and geometry such as sacks and bags. The first prototype end-effector, designed for applications in the U. S. Postal Service, comprises two parallel <b>rollers</b> with gripping sur-faces, where the <b>rollers</b> are pushed towards each other. When the end-effector comes onto contact with any portion of the deformable object, the <b>rollers</b> turn inwardly so that a graspable portion of the object is dragged between the <b>rollers.</b> When sufficient material is caught between the <b>rollers,</b> the <b>rollers</b> stop rotating, whereby the <b>rollers</b> then hold the graspable portion of the object allowing the object to be maneuvered by the robot. When the <b>rollers</b> turn outwardly, the object will be released. Th...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Rollers</b> {{of three}} {{different}} material structures were examined: <b>rollers</b> consisting of pure EP resin; homogeneous EP/SiC composite <b>rollers</b> containing 5 vol. % SiC; and EP/SiC composite <b>rollers</b> with functionally gradient (FG) material structure. Wear tests were performed on the <b>rollers.</b> The wear tests showed that <b>rollers</b> of gradient structure are the most wear-resistant of all. Microhardness measurements were performed on the materials of the three different <b>rollers.</b> SEM images were made of the surface of wear traces. In {{order to get to}} know better the effect of SiC reinforcement particles on the wear mechanism, microhardness measurements were simulated by 3 D FE micro-models. The SEM images and the FE models were used to explain the excellent wear behavior of the tread of <b>rollers</b> with gradient material distribution...|$|R

5|$|Phantom's Revenge (formerly {{known as}} Steel Phantom) is a steel <b>roller</b> coaster at Kennywood. When {{it opened in}} 1991, it was the fastest <b>roller</b> coaster and had the longest drop of any <b>roller</b> coaster in the world. The ride was {{originally}} manufactured by Arrow Dynamics. After the 2000 season, D.H. Morgan Manufacturing {{was brought in to}} renovate the ride, most notably to remove the four inversions. Unlike most <b>roller</b> coasters, the ride's second drop through Thunderbolt's structure is longer than its first drop.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roller</b> {{coasters}} are amusement rides {{developed for}} amusement parks and modern theme parks. During the 16th and 17th centuries, rides consisting of wooden sleds that took riders down large slides made from ice were popular in Russia. The first <b>roller</b> coasters, where {{the train was}} attached to a wooden track, first appeared in France in the early 1800s. Although wooden <b>roller</b> coasters are still being produced, steel <b>roller</b> coasters are more common {{and can be found}} on every continent except Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Rumors {{of a new}} <b>roller</b> coaster {{being built}} at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay began to {{circulate}} after a <b>roller</b> coaster enthusiast emailed the park and received a response saying that a <b>roller</b> coaster would be built. These rumors stated that the <b>roller</b> coaster would include a splashdown and an inversion on Bolliger & Mabillard's Dive Coaster, both a first for its kind. Later in the season, the park began to remove part of the track of Serengeti Express. On April 26, 2004, construction permits were discovered that confirmed that a <b>roller</b> coaster, restaurant, and gift shop would be constructed.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rollers</b> {{themselves}} may be {{made from}} wood, aluminum alloy, or plastic. Aluminum alloy is usually a better choice because plastic <b>rollers</b> tend to bend and misshape from their regular cylindrical shape after use.

50|$|In the UK, {{a number}} of {{companies}} owned fleets of steam <b>rollers</b> and contracted them out to local authorities.

40|$|Abstract. In the plasma-carburizing method, the {{detrimental}} {{grain boundary}} oxides {{in the surface}} of the materials and sooting problems are eliminated and the high carbon content near the surface is easily achieved. This paper describes a study on the contact fatigue strength and wear characteristics of plasma-carburized <b>rollers.</b> Test <b>rollers</b> made of super-carburizing steel MAC 14 and conventional carburizing steel SCM 415 were plasma-super-carburized under different carburizing conditions. The contact fatigue tests were carried out for these plasma-super-carburized <b>rollers.</b> The effects of case depths on the contact fatigue strength of these <b>rollers</b> were determined. The effect of shot-peening on the contact fatigue strength was also examined by carrying out contact fatigue tests for shot-peened <b>rollers.</b> The wear tests were also carried out and then the wear characteristics of test <b>rollers</b> were determined.

5|$|By 2010, B {{employed}} twelve engineers, twelve draftsmen and two draftswomen. The {{company has}} made other {{contributions to the}} <b>roller</b> coaster industry. The company built the trains for the Psyclone, a now-demolished wooden <b>roller</b> coaster at Six Flags Magic Mountain. The trains were later used on the park's Colossus wooden <b>roller</b> coaster (until it was refurbished by Rocky Mountain Construction), but were only used during October each year. The trains faced backward and usually raced against trains on the second track, which ran forward. In 2013, B supplied new trains for Steel Dragon 2000, built by D. H. Morgan Manufacturing in 2000. As of 2012, Bolliger & Mabillard has 85 operating <b>roller</b> coasters worldwide, twenty-two of which are listed among the Amusement Today Golden Ticket Awards Top 50 Steel Coasters List for 2012, and five are in the top 10.
