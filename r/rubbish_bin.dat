5|$|On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a {{second-hand}} drum kit {{consisting of}} a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a <b>rubbish</b> <b>bin</b> lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, {{who went on to}} book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.|$|E
5|$|The show's puppeteers claim {{there are}} {{different}} problems working with different characters. For example, Destiny is the largest puppet and so moving her is more difficult. As Marion {{spends much of his}} time sitting on top of a <b>rubbish</b> <b>bin,</b> his puppeteer, Brownlow-Pike, has to stand inside a bottomless bin for long periods of time. Kali is said to be the most difficult puppet to work with, because as she has no hands she is limited to what she can hold.|$|E
5|$|His {{schedule}} in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he {{competed in the}} long jump and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon. He won four of the five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place {{in the long jump}}. Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a <b>rubbish</b> <b>bin</b> and won his medals wearing them.|$|E

500|$|In 1853, Tischendorf {{revisited}} the Saint Catherine's Monastery to get {{the remaining}} 86 folios, but without success. Returning in 1859, this time under the patronage of Tsar Alexander II of Russia, he was shown the Codex Sinaiticus. He would later claim to have found it discarded in a <b>rubbish</b> <b>bin.</b> (This story {{may have been a}} fabrication, or the manuscripts in question may have been unrelated to Codex Sinaiticus: Rev.

Is it likely... that a manuscript known in the library catalogue would have been jettisoned in the rubbish basket." [...] Indeed, it has been noted that the leaves were in [...] "suspiciously good condition" [...] for something found in the trash.) Tischendorf had been sent to search for manuscripts by Russia's Tsar Alexander II, who was convinced there were still manuscripts to be found at the Sinai monastery. The text of this part of the codex was published by Tischendorf in 1862: ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 2016, {{three people}} {{associated}} with the South Herefordshire Hunt (UK) were arrested on suspicion of causing suffering to animals in response to claims that live fox cubs were used to train hounds to hunt and kill.

2500|$|The attack {{took place}} in Brindisi, Apulia, {{on the morning of}} Saturday, 19 May 2012, when at 7:45 a.m. local time three gas {{cylinder}} bombs detonated inside a <b>rubbish</b> <b>bin</b> close to the entrance gate in front of the Morvillo Falcone high school as students were arriving and milling outside. A bus had just unloaded more students. The cylinders, which were tied together, exploded beside 16-year-old fashion student Melissa Bassi, who took the full force of the powerful blast wave and suffered [...] "horrific injuries", which included burns on 90 percent of her body and the loss of an arm.

2500|$|Wang {{contends that}} the fixed class nature of constitutionalism is bourgeoisie. While {{there are some who}} try to {{separate}} constitutionalism from the Western capitalist system, Wang argues, by doing so they are only safeguarding the rights of the bourgeoisie and their [...] "universal values". Constitutionalism is used as a tool by the ruling class (the bourgeoisie) to oppress the labouring masses (the proletariat). Wang reiterates Mao's position of [...] "constitutionalism, or what is called democratic politics, in fact is a politics that eats people." [...] Wang concludes his remarks on constitutionalism by claiming that [...] "it is [...] necessary to sweep this [...] into the <b>rubbish</b> <b>bin</b> of history".|$|E
2500|$|An {{even more}} extreme example was his notorious [...] "sick bag" [...] prank. This {{involved}} carrying {{on to an}} aircraft a tin of Heinz Russian Salad, which he would then surreptitiously empty into an air-sickness bag. At the appropriate point in the flight, he would pretend to vomit loudly and violently into the bag. Then, to the horror of passengers and crew, he would proceed to eat the contents. One April Fools' Day Humphries placed a roast dinner and glass of champagne in an inner-city <b>rubbish</b> <b>bin.</b> Later in the morning, when there were many businesspeople queuing at a nearby building, Humphries approached {{the group as a}} dirty, dishevelled man. He walked to the bin, opened the lid and proceeded to lift the roast and glass of champagne and drink from the glass. Much to the amazement of watchers-by, he found a suitable seating area and began to eat the meal. Such stunts were the early manifestations of a lifelong interest in the bizarre, discomforting, and subversive.|$|E
2500|$|The {{next day}} (Monday, 15 June), the man checked {{out of the}} hotel at 13:06 and handed in his room key. He left with a black {{shoulder}} bag, a purple plastic bag, and a different black luggage bag. He did not have the same black carry-on luggage bag he had when he first arrived in Sligo. He walked to the bus station via Quay Street, Wine Street and stopped at Quayside Shopping Centre and awkwardly waited in the doorway for a number of minutes. At 13:16 he left the Quayside Shopping Centre and walked along Wine Street {{in the direction of the}} bus station, still carrying all three bags. At 13:38 he ordered a cappuccino and a ham and cheese toasted sandwich at the bus station. While eating his food, he looked at pieces of paper that he kept in his pocket. After reading the pieces of paper, he tore the paper in half and threw it away in a nearby <b>rubbish</b> <b>bin.</b> He then mounted a bus that departed at 14:20 for Rosses Point. It was reported that he was seen by 16 people while walking on the beach, casually greeting the passersby.|$|E

2500|$|The chiffonniers (sometimes {{translated}} [...] "rag-pickers" [...] in English) {{were the}} lowest class of Paris workers; they sifted through trash and garbage on the Paris streets {{for anything that}} could be salvaged. [...] They numbered about twelve thousand {{at the end of the}} Second Empire. [...] Before the arrival of the poubelle, or <b>rubbish</b> <b>bin,</b> during the Third Republic, trash and garbage were simply dumped onto the street. [...] The lowest level of chiffoniers searched through the common refuse; they had to work very quickly, because there was great competition, and they feared that their competitors would find the best objects first. [...] The placier was a higher class of chiffonier, who took trash from the houses of the upper classes, usually in arrangement with the concierge. [...] The placier provided certain services, such as beating carpets or cleaning doorways, and in exchange was able to get more valuable items, from silk and satin to old clothing and shoes to leftovers from banquets. [...] Six houses on the Champs-Elysees were enough to provide for the family of a placier. The next level up was the chineur, a merchant who bought and resold trash, such as old bottles and corks from taverns, old clothes and bits of iron. At the top of the hierarchy were the maître-chiffoniers, who had large sheds where trash was sorted and then resold. Almost everything was re-used: old corks were sold to wine-merchants; orange peels were sold to distillers; bones were used to make dominoes, buttons and knife handles; cigar butts were resold; and stale bread was burned and used to make a cheap coffee substitute. Human hair was collected, carefully sorted by colour, length and texture and used to make wigs and hair extensions.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{loosely based}} upon the game of cricket, many aspects are improvised: the playing ground, the rules, the teams, and the equipment. Quite often there are no teams at all; the players take turns at batting and there is often no {{emphasis}} on actually scoring runs. The bat can be anything, {{as long as it}} can hit the ball and can be suitably held in the hands. However, usage of a bat is necessary. A ball is the other essential item. Tennis balls are often used {{due to the fact that}} they are less likely to inflict injuries than a cricket ball. They are also much cheaper and more readily available than a leather cricket ball and are easier to hit due to their slower air-speed and relative lightness. Tennis balls also bounce more than normal cricket balls, especially at low speeds. [...] Often a tennis ball will be heavily taped on one side to give the ball extra 'swing'. This is known as a 'swing ball'—swing balls may be made with: gaffer tape, electrical tape, plumbing tape or any other kind of tape available. The pitch can be any stretch of ground that is reasonably flat. The wicket may be any convenient object – a chair, a cardboard box, a set of long twigs or sticks, a <b>rubbish</b> <b>bin,</b> tree or a drawing on the wall. [...] Often, the wicket is by no means close to the official size, but it is used anyway. A wicket at the non-striker's end is generally a single stump if proper stumps are available and in the absence of larger objects may be just a hat or a shoe. [...] Its main purpose is to mark the bowler's crease, but can be instrumental when there are two batters and one may be run out. Games with relatively few players typically forgo the teams and innings format of professional cricket, opting instead for a batsmen-vs-everyone format.|$|E
