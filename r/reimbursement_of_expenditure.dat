40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to review the {{requirements}} for the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars and to compare the reimbursement status, market share, and <b>reimbursement</b> costs <b>of</b> biosimilars in selected Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. Methods: A questionnaire-based survey was conducted between November 2016 and January 2017 among experts from the following CEE countries: Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Croatia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Romania. The requirements for the pricing and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars were reviewed for each country. Data on the extent <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biologic drugs (separately for original products and biosimilars) in the years 2014 and 2015 were also collected for each country, along with data on the total pharmaceutical and total public health care budgets. Results: Our survey revealed that no specific criteria were applied for the pricing and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars in the selected CEE countries; the price of biosimilars was usually reduced compared with original drugs and specific price discounts were common. Substitution and interchangeability were generally allowed, although in most countries they were at the discretion of the physician after a clinical assessment. Original biologic drugs and the corresponding biosimilars were usually in the same homogeneous group, and internal reference pricing was usually employed. The <b>reimbursement</b> rate <b>of</b> biosimilars in the majority of the countries was the same and amounted to 100 %. Generally, the higher shares <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> were shown for the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> original drugs than for biosimilars, except for filgrastim, somatropin, and epoetin (alfa and zeta). The shares <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> on the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilar products ranged from 8. 0 % in Estonia in 2014 to 32. 4 % in Lithuania in 2015, and generally increased in 2015. The share <b>of</b> <b>expenditures</b> on <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars in the total pharmaceutical budget differed between the countries, with the highest observed value for Slovakia and Hungary and the lowest—for Croatia. Conclusions: The requirements for the pricing and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilar products as well as the access of patients to biologic treatment do not differ significantly between the considered CEE countries. Biosimilar drugs significantly influence the <b>reimbursement</b> systems <b>of</b> these countries, and the <b>expenditure</b> on the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> biosimilars is increasing as they are becoming more accessible to patients...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} design of health {{insurance}} with ex post moral hazard, when there is imperfect competition {{in the market for}} the medical product. Various scenarios, such as monopoly pricing, price negotiation or horizontal differentiation are considered. The insurance contract specifies two types of copayments: an ad valorem coinsurance rate and a specific (per unit) copayment. By combining both copayment rates in an adequate way the insurer can effectively control the producer price, which is then set so that the producer’s revenue just covers fixed costs. Consequently, a suitable regulation of the copayment instruments leads to the same <b>reimbursement</b> rule <b>of</b> individual <b>expenditures</b> as under perfect competition for medical products. Additional rationing of coverage because of imperfect competition as advocated by Feldstein (1973) is thus not necessary. Interestingly the optimal policy closely resembles a reference price mechanism in which copayment rates are low (possibly negative) and coinsurance rates are high...|$|R

40|$|This diploma thesis <b>Reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> {{costs in}} trial {{proceedings}} and enforcement proceedings describes the main aspects related to <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> {{costs in the}} two kinds <b>of</b> civil procedure. <b>Reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs {{is seen as a}} secondary topic, but can cause serious property issues to the parties. The purpose of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive look at the issue <b>of</b> <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in trial and enforcement proceedings. The thesis is composed of an introduction, two main sections which are dealing with <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in trial proceedings and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in the enforcement proceedings and conclusion. In the introduction I'm dealing with the reasons why I've chosen this topic. The actual text of the thesis is divided into two main parts - <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in trial proceedings and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in the enforcement proceedings. The first part deals with selected kinds of costs, with an emphasis on case law, and also deals with the issues connected with the abolition of regulation No. 484 / 2000 Coll. Within subchapters 1. 2 and 1. 3 I analyze <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs in the contentious and non-contentious proceedings, individual principles governing the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> costs and institutes related to reimbursement, specifically pre- action appeal and the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the frequency <b>of</b> utilization and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> the common diagnostic tests and treatment modalities used in testicular cancer care. Methods: LifeLink™ (IMS Health, Danbury, CT, USA) Claims Database was used. We identified 877 subjects with a primary diagnosis of testicular cancer (ICD 186. 9) between 2007 and 2012. Median <b>reimbursement</b> and frequency <b>of</b> the diagnostic/treatment modalities used were recorded. Results: The most common claim was a vein puncture with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 9. 11. Tumor markers, alpha-fetoprotein and beta human chorionic gonadotropin, were ranked 6 th and 7 th with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 52. 13 and $ 48. 71, respectively. Chest X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest were ranked 9 th and 13 th with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 68. 51 and $ 769, respectively. A contrast CT scan of abdomen and pelvis was the 11 th most frequent claim with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 855. 89. The three invasive treatment modalities, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy were ranked 8 th, 15 th, and 164 th with median <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> $ 2858. 38, $ 3988. 25, and $ 2009. 67, respectively. Conclusions: Testicular cancer is not an inexpensive disease. Surgery is the less utilized than radiation and chemotherapy despite lower cost. This may have implications to national guidelines and training since these treatments often carry the same grade of recommendation...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide an analysis of the factors which have a significant impact on the growth <b>of</b> public <b>expenditure</b> on medical products in Bulgaria. Methods: This research work consists of a critical analysis of the data reported by the National Health Insurance Fund in Bulgaria on the stability of the healthcare insurance model and the implementation of the budget for 2014. Results: The results from the current analysis indicate that the growth <b>of</b> public <b>expenditure</b> is directly proportional to the number of reimbursed medical products and that the pattern of prescriptions including the innovative medical products mainly for the treatment of oncological and rare diseases has a significant impact on it. Conclusion: The reasons for the increase <b>of</b> public <b>expenditure</b> in Bulgaria include the non-transparent decisions in pricing and <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> the products, the lack of guidelines for presenting pharmacological evidence and the lack of legislatively-defined drug policies for the management and control of the patterns of medical prescriptions...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} my thesis is {{to point out}} the {{increase}} of the amount of the petty cases, to analyze its reasons, to describe the development of the relevant legislation and case law and to deal with some main legal arguments related to the issue <b>of</b> the <b>reimbursement</b> <b>of</b> the costs of proceedings in petty cases. The reason for my research is mainly its topicality and rapid evolution in a few past years. The boom of the mass claim recovery realized by the specialized "debt companies" was the reason of the legislative amendments and led to the ground-breaking decisions of the Constitutional Court, which resulted in the repeal of the regulation No. 484 / 2000 Coll. The thesis is composed of the introduction, four chapters and conclusion.
