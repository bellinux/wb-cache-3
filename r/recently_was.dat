5|$|Many {{famous people}} {{lived and worked}} in Birbhum, {{specially}} at Santiniketan. Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen is one of them. Rabindranath Tagore made this district his home and established his great centre of learning, Visva Bharati University at Santiniketan. Jaydev Kenduli, which until <b>recently</b> <b>was</b> believed to be the birthplace of the 12th century Sanskrit poet Jayadeva, is {{on the bank of the}} river Ajay.|$|E
5|$|South Stoneham House is a Grade II* listed former {{manor house}} in Swaythling, Southampton; the former {{seat of the}} Barons Swaythling before {{the family moved to}} the nearby Townhill Park House.

5|$|The electoral {{conditions}} were announced as such: The election 67 districts {{were reduced to}} 47. M'ba disqualified Aubame by announcing no one who held a post <b>recently</b> <b>was</b> banned. Any party would have to submit 47 candidates who had to pay US$160 or none at all. Thus, over US$7,500 would be deposited without considering campaign expenses. M'ba's idea was that no party other than his would {{have the money to}} enter candidates. In response to this, the opposition announced its refusal to participate in elections that they did not consider fair.|$|E

5|$|The party {{also became}} {{very active in}} {{establishing}} contacts with post-communist parties in Eastern European countries, including the Croatian Party of Rights, Slovak National Party and IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement. While not keeping official contacts, it was in addition very supportive of left-wing nationalist parties such as the Scottish National Party, Irish Sinn Féin and Basque Herri Batasuna. Some of the parties it established contacts with most <b>recently</b> <b>was</b> the Freedom Party of Austria and the Italian Lega Nord, which {{after a period of}} distrust, maintained contacts since 2002.|$|E
5|$|Dynamite Headdy was {{originally}} released in Japan on 5 August 1994 for the Sega Genesis, with North American and European releases following in September and October respectively. A port was released for the Game Gear, and a Master System port {{based on the}} Game Gear version was released exclusively in Brazil. The game was included along with Gunstar Heroes and Alien Soldier in Sega Ages 2500: Gunstar Heroes Treasure Box, a compilation released for the PlayStation 2 in 2006 in Japan. The compilation includes all versions of Dynamite Headdy released on all three Sega platforms across all regions. The game saw a digital re-release on the Wii via the Virtual Console in July 2007. It was also included in Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and most <b>recently</b> <b>was</b> released on Steam on 2 May 2012.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{fed by the}} River Westbourne and Tyburn Brook in the 1730s, the lake's {{water was}} then pumped from the Thames in the 1830s. The water is now pumped from three {{boreholes}} within Hyde Park, the most recent being installed in May 2012 {{as part of the}} 2011–2012 restoration of the Lake. The Serpentine provided a focal point for The Great Exhibition of 1851, and more <b>recently</b> <b>was</b> a venue for the men's and women's triathlon and marathon swimming events in the London 2012 Olympics. Since 1864 the Serpentine Swimming Club has organised a 100-yard race every Christmas morning. In 1913, the Peter Pan Cup was inaugurated for this race by J. M. Barrie, the creator of the fictional character Peter Pan.|$|E

5|$|P. l. mesopotamica or Mesopotamian lion, flourished {{during the}} Neo-Assyrian Period (approximately 1000–600 BC). It {{inhabited}} the Mesopotamian Plain where it probably represents a distinct sub-species. Nearly all ancient Mesopotamian representations of male lions demonstrate full underbelly hair in which until <b>recently</b> <b>was</b> only {{identified in the}} Barbary lion (Panthera leo leo) from Northern Africa and in most Asiatic lions (P. l. persica) from captivity in colder climates. Ancient evidence from adjacent landmasses reveal no substantiation for lions with underbelly hair in this manner so that the distinct phenotype of depicted lions in ancient Mesopotamia (including Babylon, Elam and ancient Persia) represent an extinct sub-species. Many of the images of these lions are derived from lion hunting sculptures so that the extinction of this sub-species likely resulted from overhunting {{in the ancient world}} (See the Cultural significance below).|$|E
5|$|Synthetic diamond {{is already}} used as {{radiation}} detection device. It is radiation hard {{and has a}} wide bandgap of 5.5 eV (at room temperature). Diamond is also distinguished from most other semiconductors {{by the lack of}} a stable native oxide. This makes it difficult to fabricate surface MOS devices, but it does create the potential for UV radiation {{to gain access to the}} active semiconductor without absorption in a surface layer. Because of these properties, it is employed in applications such as the BaBar detector at the Stanford Linear Accelerator and BOLD (Blind to the Optical Light Detectors for VUV solar observations). A diamond VUV detector <b>recently</b> <b>was</b> used in the European LYRA program.|$|E
5|$|In 1792 {{over the}} 25 {{days of the}} first {{landfall}} in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, Delahaye established a European vegetable garden. Its purpose was {{as a source of}} food and propagation material for the indigenous people, and also as a supply of provisions for future visiting European vessels. This was the first European garden on mainland Tasmania, planted just north of where the ships were anchored and, until <b>recently,</b> <b>was</b> last sighted by Lady Jane Franklin in the 1840s. Offshore, on Bruny Island, a small orchard had been planted a few months previously by Englishman William Bligh's expedition, presumably planted by Bligh's gardener David Nelson. Delahaye's journal reports that he planted celery, chervil, chicory, cabbages, grey romaine lettuce, different kinds of turnip, white onion, radishes, sorrel, peas, black salsify and potatoes; he also had large quantities sewn in the woods, thrown at random where they might grow. Returning on 21 January 1793 the garden had not been productive, the seed having been planted in dry and sandy soil. This time Delahaye tried explaining to the Aboriginal people, referred to today as the Lyluequonny, that the tubers, when cooked in fire embers, made fine eating. Calling in on the Adventure Bay side of Bruny Island Delahaye examined and tended the two pomegranate, one quince and three fig trees planted by Bligh’s expedition in 1792.|$|E
