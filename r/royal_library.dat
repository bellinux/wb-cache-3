5|$|The <b>Royal</b> <b>Library,</b> {{belonging}} to the University of Copenhagen, is the largest library in the Nordic countries with an almost complete collection of all printed Danish books since 1482. Founded in 1648, the <b>Royal</b> <b>Library</b> is located at four sites in the city, the main one being on the Slotsholmen waterfront. Copenhagen's public library network has over 20 outlets, the largest being the Central Library (Københavns Hovedbibliotek) on Krystalgade in the inner city.|$|E
5|$|As {{examples}} {{of some of}} the world's most important records and first printed matter, researchers will find herbals scattered through the world's most famous libraries including the Vatican Library in Rome, the Bodleian Library in Oxford, the <b>Royal</b> <b>Library</b> in Windsor, the British Library in London and the major continental libraries.|$|E

5|$|Nielsen's {{works are}} {{sometimes}} referred to by CNW numbers, based on the Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works (CNW) published online by the Danish <b>Royal</b> <b>Library</b> in 2015. The CNW catalogue is intended to replace the 1965 catalogue compiled by Dan Fog and Torben Schousboe (FS numbers).|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople in 1453, the codex was brought to Florence by an émigré scholar. It belonged to Niccolo Ridolpho († 1550) Cardinal of Florence. After his death it was {{probably}} bought by Piero Strozzi, an Italian military leader, for Catherine de' Medici. Catherine brought it to France {{as part of her}} dowry, and from the Bourbon <b>royal</b> <b>library</b> it came to rest in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris. The manuscript was bound in 1602.|$|E
5|$|Johann Christian Götze (1692–1749), German theologian and {{director}} of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Library</b> at Dresden, purchased the codex from a private owner in Vienna in 1739 while traveling to Italy. Thompson speculates that the codex was sent as a tribute to Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor by Hernán Cortés, governor of Mexico, since examples of local writings and other Maya items were sent to the king in 1519 when he was living in Vienna.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{invention}} of photography in 1839, photographs {{have been included in}} The <b>Royal</b> <b>Library’s</b> collections. The first items in the collection were photographs pasted into printed books. Later a collection of individual photographs emerged through donations and acquisitions. In 1902, the collection was incorporated into the then newly established Department of Maps and Pictures. From the beginning of the 1950s, efforts to build a comprehensive photographic collection were intensified and the collection grew tremendously under the direction of Bjørn Ochner, Denmark’s first photo-historian. Today the <b>Royal</b> <b>Library's</b> collection contains around 18 million photographs.|$|R
50|$|The National Museum of Photography, {{founded in}} 1996, moved into its current {{premises}} when the Black Diamond {{was completed in}} 1999. However, the museum {{is based on the}} <b>Royal</b> <b>Library's</b> collections.|$|R
50|$|There is {{also the}} {{creation}} of <b>royal</b> <b>libraries</b> {{as in the case}} of Saint Louis and Charles V. Books were also collected in private libraries, which became more common in the 14th and 15th centuries.|$|R
5|$|The older {{writing was}} first noticed by Pierre Allix, a Protestant pastor. Jean Boivin, {{supervisor}} of the <b>Royal</b> <b>Library,</b> made the first extracts of various readings of the codex (under the notation of Paris 9) to Ludolph Küster, who published Mill's New Testament in 1710. In 1834–1835 potassium ferricyanide was used to bring out faded or eradicated ink, which {{had the effect of}} defacing the vellum from green and blue to black and brown.|$|E
5|$|As {{written in}} the {{original}} 1926 edition of the score, the Fifth Symphony is scored for 3 flutes (third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, cymbals, triangle, tambourine, snare drum, celesta, and strings. Some optional doublings are added in the 1950 edition of the score revised by Emil Telmányi and Erik Tuxen; these include the third flute doubling flute in G and the second bassoon doubling contrabassoon. These optional doublings are discarded in the latest 1998 Carl Nielsen Edition score, which was produced as a co-operation between the Danish <b>Royal</b> <b>Library</b> and Edition Wilhelm Hansen.|$|E
5|$|Between 1994 and 2009 a {{complete}} {{new edition of}} Nielsen's works, the Carl Nielsen Edition, was commissioned by the Danish Government (at a cost of over 40 million kroner). For many of the works, including the operas Maskarade and Saul and David, and the complete Aladdin music, this was their first printed publication, copies of manuscripts having previously been used in performances. The scores are now all available for download free of charge at the website of the Danish <b>Royal</b> <b>Library</b> (which also owns most of Nielsen's music manuscripts).|$|E

5|$|Matthias {{established}} a professional army (the Black Army of Hungary), reformed {{the administration of}} justice, reduced {{the power of the}} barons, and promoted the careers of talented individuals chosen for their abilities rather than their social statuses. Matthias patronized art and science; his <b>royal</b> <b>library,</b> the Bibliotheca Corviniana, was one of the largest collections of books in Europe. With his patronage, Hungary became the first country to embrace the Renaissance from Italy. As Matthias the Just, the monarch who wandered among his subjects in disguise, he remains a popular hero of Hungarian folk tales.|$|E
5|$|Matthias {{started the}} {{systematic}} {{collection of books}} after the arrival of his first librarian, Galeotto Marzio, a friend of Janus Pannonius from Ferrara in around 1465. The exchange of letters between Taddeo Ugoleto, who succeeded Marzio in 1471, and Francesco Bandini contributed {{to the development of}} the <b>royal</b> <b>library</b> because the latter regularly informed his friend of new manuscripts. Matthias also employed scriptors, illuminators, and book-binders. Although the exact number of his books is unknown, his Bibliotheca Corviniana was one of Europe's largest collections of books when he died.|$|E
5|$|Novello printed an Octavo {{edition of}} the D major Magnificat in 1874, using a {{translation}} to English which John Troutbeck based on the text in The Book of Common Prayer. In 1880, when Bach's autographs of the composition were already kept in the <b>Royal</b> <b>Library</b> (later State Library) of Berlin, Philipp Spitta devoted many pages to the Magnificat in his Bach-biography, considering it {{recognized as one of}} the greatest achievements of the composer's genius. Bach's Magnificat was performed several times in the last quarter of the 19th century, for instance in Germany and the Netherlands.|$|E

5|$|The first Prophet in {{the mythology}} of Carnivàle is the Alpha. This {{creature}} is never mentioned in the series, but Knauf described her as a female who lived before the Flood and whose story was lost with {{the destruction of the}} <b>Royal</b> <b>Library</b> of Alexandria. The Alpha spawned the first pair of Avatara, manifestations of some higher power or House; one is Light and the other Dark. A Creature of Light and a Creature of Darkness have been born to each generation since, and unlike the Alpha, they have always been male.|$|E
5|$|These notebooks—originally loose {{papers of}} {{different}} types and sizes, distributed by friends after his death—have {{found their way into}} major collections such as the <b>Royal</b> <b>Library</b> at Windsor Castle, the Louvre, the Biblioteca Nacional de España, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, which holds the twelve-volume Codex Atlanticus, and British Library in London, which has put a selection from the Codex Arundel (BL Arundel MS 263) online. The Codex Leicester is the only major scientific work of Leonardo in private hands; it is owned by Bill Gates and is displayed once a year in different cities around the world.|$|E
5|$|Author Charles Higham {{claimed that}} Anthony Blunt, an MI5 agent and Soviet spy, acting on {{orders from the}} British royal family, made a {{successful}} secret trip to Schloss Friedrichshof in Germany {{towards the end of}} the war to retrieve sensitive letters between the Duke of Windsor and Adolf Hitler and other leading Nazis. What is certain is that George VI sent the Royal Librarian, Owen Morshead, accompanied by Blunt, then working part-time in the <b>Royal</b> <b>Library</b> as well as for British intelligence, to Friedrichshof in March 1945 to secure papers relating to the German Empress Victoria, the eldest child of Queen Victoria. Looters had stolen part of the castle's archive, including surviving letters between daughter and mother, as well as other valuables, some of which were recovered in Chicago after the war. The papers rescued by Morshead and Blunt, and those returned by the American authorities from Chicago, were deposited in the Royal Archives.|$|E

5|$|Customs, {{traditions and}} moral {{principles}} based on Buddhism {{were used as}} the bases of law. Specific laws were eventually developed and adopted. Samantapasadika, a 5th-century commentary, gives details of complex regulations on the theft of fish. The chief judicial officer was known as viniccayamacca and there were several judicial officers under him, known as vinicchayaka. Apart from them, village headmen and provincial governors were also given the power to issue judgments. The king was the final judge in legal disputes, and all cases against {{members of the royal}} family and high dignitaries of the state were judged by him. However, the king had to exercise this power with care and after consulting with his advisers. Udaya I recorded judgments that were regarded as important precedents in the <b>royal</b> <b>library</b> in order to maintain uniformity in judicial decisions.|$|E
5|$|George {{donated the}} <b>royal</b> <b>library</b> to the British Museum in 1757, {{four years after}} the museum's foundation. He had no {{interest}} in reading, or in the arts and sciences, and preferred to spend his leisure hours stag-hunting on horseback or playing cards. In 1737, he founded the Georg August University of Göttingen, the first university in the Electorate of Hanover, and visited it in 1748. The asteroid 359 Georgia was named in his honour at the University in 1902. He served as the Chancellor of Trinity College, Dublin, between 1716 and 1727, and in 1754 issued the charter for King's College in New York City, which later became Columbia University. The province of Georgia, founded by royal charter in 1732, was named after him.|$|E
5|$|The Anthony Roll is {{a record}} of ships of the English Tudor navy of the 1540s, named after its creator, Anthony Anthony. It {{originally}} consisted of three rolls of vellum, depicting 58naval vessels along with information on their size, crew, armament, and basic equipment. The rolls were presented to KingHenry VIII in 1546, and were kept in the <b>royal</b> <b>library.</b> In 1680 Charles II gave two of the rolls to Samuel Pepys, who had them cut up and bound as a single volume book, which {{is now in the}} Pepys Library at Magdalene College, Cambridge. The third roll remained in the royal collection until it was given by William IV to his daughter, Mary Fox, who sold it to the British Museum in 1858; it is now owned by the British Library.|$|E
