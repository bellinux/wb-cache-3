2500|$|A more {{powerful}} {{contender for the}} throne was Mircea the Shepherd, nominally his brother, who lived in Istanbul and periodically bribed the Grand Vizier, Rüstem Pasha, to obtain his support. The competition became tense in December 1544, when Paisie was ordered to send his eldest son, Marco or Marcu, who was by then his nominal co-ruler, as an hostage to the Porte. He failed to deliver within the required interval, which alerted the Ottomans that he was plotting a revolt. Suleiman prepared his ouster, making sure that Mircea {{would be able to}} occupy the throne before Paisie could [...] "abscond with the treasury". Other authors suggest that the Ottomans had learned about Paisie's Habsburg alliance, which thus contributed to his ouster. The corresponding firman for his dethronement was dated February 22, 1545, precisely as Mircea was reentering Wallachia. According to Gheone, the most precise dating for Paisie's removal is [...] "late February", which revises an earlier consensus, based on Mircea's first known writ, and which has [...] "March 25" [...] as the <b>relevant</b> <b>date.</b>|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{approach}} to identify top <b>relevant</b> <b>dates</b> in Web snippets {{with respect to a}} given implicit temporal query. Our approach is two-fold. First, we propose a generic temporal similarity measure called GTE, which evaluates the temporal similarity between a query and a date. Second, we propose a classification model to accurately relate <b>relevant</b> <b>dates</b> to their corresponding query terms and withdraw irrelevant ones. We suggest two different solutions: a threshold-based classification strategy and a supervised classifier based on a combination of multiple similarity measures. We evaluate both strategies over a set of real-world text queries and compare the performance of our Web snippet approach with a query log approach over the same set of queries. Experiments show that determining the most <b>relevant</b> <b>dates</b> of any given implicit temporal query can be improved with GTE combined with the second order similarity measure InfoSimba, the Dice coefficient and the threshold-based strategy compared to (1) first-order similarity measures and (2) the query log based approach...|$|R
50|$|The tone of list {{provision}} was amended in 1981 {{to provide that}} the rateable value was to be ascertained by reference to the value as at a designated date known as the “relevant date”.

In recent years, the <b>relevant</b> <b>date</b> has been fixed at 1 October for the Valuation List to take effect on 1 April in the following year, i.e. the <b>relevant</b> <b>date</b> for the 2011/12 Valuation List would be 1 October 2010.|$|E

40|$|International audienceGenerically, {{search engines}} fail to {{understand}} the user's temporal intents when expressed as implicit temporal queries. This causes the retrieval of less relevant information and prevents users from being aware of the possible temporal dimension of the query results. In this paper, we aim to develop a language-independent model that tackles the temporal dimensions of a query and identifies its most relevant time periods. For this purpose, we propose a temporal similarity measure capable of associating a <b>relevant</b> <b>date(s)</b> to a given query and filtering out irrelevant ones. Our approach {{is based on the}} exploitation of temporal information from web content, particularly within the set of k-top retrieved web snippets returned in response to a query. We particularly focus on extracting years, which are a kind of temporal information that often appears in this type of collection. We evaluate our methodology using a set of real-world text temporal queries, which are clear concepts (i. e. queries which are non-ambiguous in concept and temporal in their purpose). Experiments show that when compared to baseline methods, determining the most <b>relevant</b> <b>dates</b> relating to any given implicit temporal query can be improved with a new temporal similarity measure...|$|R
