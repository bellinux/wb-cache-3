50|$|Oxybasis rubra (syn. Chenopodium rubrum), {{common names}} <b>red</b> <b>goosefoot</b> or coastblite goosefoot, {{is a member}} of the genus Oxybasis, a {{segregate}} of Chenopodium (the goosefoots). It is native to North America and Eurasia.|$|E
50|$|The {{botanist}} J E Lousley {{visited the}} island {{one afternoon in}} May 1957 and recorded fifty-four species of plant, despite finding most of the island covered in a tangle of bracken and bramble to 1 m high and difficult to penetrate. Unusual plants (for the Isles of Scilly) in the brackish pool are sea-milkwort (Glaux maritima), fennel-leaved pondweed (Stuckenia pectinata) and <b>red</b> <b>goosefoot</b> (Chenopodium rubrum). A visit by John Hunt in the 1980s found a ″healthy″ growth of bracken. The fern soft shield-fern (Polystichum setiferum) {{once thought to be}} very rare on the islands has now been found on all the inhabited islands (except Bryher) and curiously also on Northwethel.|$|E
40|$|Phytotoxicity, uptake, and {{metabolism}} of 1, 4 -dichlorobenzene (1, 4 -DCB) by carrot (Daucus carota L.), soybean (Glycine max. L.), tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.), and <b>red</b> <b>goosefoot</b> (Chenopodiun rubrum L.) {{cell suspension}} cultures were studied. Sealed glass systems were utilized {{for the investigation}} because 1, 4 -DCB is volatile. The sealed systems affect the growth of plant cells, but do not provide different results when testing xenobiotic uptake and metabolism. 1, 4 -Dichlorobenzene (40 mu g in 40 mi medium) was taken up by carrot (49 %), soybean (50 %), and <b>red</b> <b>goosefoot</b> (62 %) cells. Only the soybean cell cultures provided evidence {{of the existence of}} metabolites of this compound, probably conjugates of chlorophenols. Conditions for phytotoxicity tests were modified because the growth of cell cultures was affected when sealed for longer than 2 d. 1, 4 -Dichlorobenzene is toxic to cell cultures of the three tested plant species (tomato, soybean, and carrot). Concentrations of 0. 5 mM caused 50 % growth inhibition in carrot and soybean cultures. The tomato cultures were more sensitive, with 0. 05 mM causing 50 % growth inhibition...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} two plants, wall cress and short-day <b>red</b> <b>goosefoot,</b> was traced for their entire {{lifetime}} in weightlessness. In the beginning both plants grew normally: the seeds sprouted {{in the normal}} periods, and the shoots {{did not differ in}} any way from the control plants. It is true that certain roots lost their normal orientation and did not go deeper into the nutrient medium, but rather crept over its surface. But then both the wall cress and the goosefoot slowed down their normal rate of growth, which became noticeable from the rate of formation of new leaves in the wall cress and stem development in the goosefoot. Although no disorders were successfully found in the morphology of the two plants, almost half of the experimental cress and goosefoot plants ceased growth completely, yellowed and died. The other part continued to develop normally {{and by the end of}} vegetation, differed from the control plants only in a lower height. Not all were fertile since certain experimental plants, after losing spatial orientation, became twisted and produced sterile flowers...|$|E
