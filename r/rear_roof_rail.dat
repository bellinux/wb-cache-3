40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop the {{analytical}} methodology to evaluate the dynamic versus residual roof deformation characteristics of a compact SUV subjected to SAE J 2114 dolly rollover tests. Two FMVSS 208 dolly rollover tests with instrumented, restrained driver side Hybrid III dummies were evaluated during the first driver’s side <b>roof</b> <b>rail</b> ground strike. Kinematic targets were mounted on the driver dummy head and tracked via onboard cameras as a means of visual validation of <b>roof</b> <b>rail</b> deformation (assuming rail-to-dummy head contact). Test instrumentation included: accelerometers at the vehicle center of gravity (CG), <b>roof</b> <b>rail,</b> pillars and rocker panel, lap and shoulder belt load transducers, triaxial accelerometers at the center of gravity of the head, chest and pelvis of the dummies and six-axis force (and moment) transducers in the neck of the dummy. All data was recorded consistent with SAE J 211 - 1 recommendations Vehicle angular velocity and attitude were estimated using the data from multiple accelerometers, which correlated well with the test video. The accelerometer data indicate that the driver <b>roof</b> <b>rail</b> dynamic deformation was significantly greater than the residual deformation to which the <b>roof</b> <b>rail</b> rebounded following loss of ground contact. The dynamic deformation was of such magnitude that the rail intruded into the driver’s occupant survival space. A spike in driver dummy head acceleration was observed immediately following the acceleration pulse that caused the rail intrusion The presence of significant dynamic <b>roof</b> <b>rail</b> deformation is new and important quantitative information that should be added to the body of knowledge surrounding reconsideration of FMVSS 216 and catastrophic injury prevention in rollover crashes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of numerical analysis of the aluminium profiles subjected to dynamic, of different time duration impulse loading. The analysis includes the change in cross–section of the <b>roof</b> <b>rail,</b> ranging from the open ”C profile”, through closed ”Rectangular” to hybrid ”Tandem with brackets”. The main aim {{of this study is to}} model the dynamic response of the car <b>roof</b> <b>rail</b> to impulse loading, which may appear in case of collision...|$|R

50|$|The Greeley House {{is located}} {{on the north side of}} New Hampshire Route 108, just a few feet from the roadway, at a point where it bends, mainly to avoid the house. It is a 2&frac12;-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide on the first floor and three on the second. The {{entrance}} is at the center, framed by a modest surround with a peaked lintel. The <b>rear</b> <b>roof</b> line extends to the first floor, giving the house a saltbox profile, and there is a shed-roof addition on the east side which was added in the 1960s.

50|$|The Studebaker Wagonaire was {{a station}} wagon {{produced}} by the Studebaker Corporation of South Bend, Indiana, from 1963-1966. It featured a retractable sliding <b>rear</b> <b>roof</b> section that allowed the vehicle to carry items {{that would otherwise be}} too tall for a conventional station wagon of the era.|$|R
50|$|The Optare Tempo was {{launched}} in October 2004, with the first delivered to Trentbarton in February 2005.

50|$|Because of {{the shape}} of the vehicle and the flat roof that {{continued}} {{to the rear of the}} vehicle, opening the rear hatch had some drawbacks in low clearance environments. The lower part of the hatch was not like one used on a station wagon that went all the way down to the rear bumper, so loading cargo into the back wasn't as convenient as a conventional station wagon with a one piece hatchback. The rear hatch also wrapped into the <b>rear</b> <b>roof,</b> similar to a gull wing door so that the rear glass was in two pieces, one for the back window, and another partially on the <b>rear</b> <b>roof.</b> When open, the hatch rose above the roof at a right angle, providing additional overhead clearance when the hatch was open.|$|R
50|$|Full-length chrome rocker panels {{set off the}} 1951 model, and the Coupe de Ville was now {{marked with}} noticeably-improved trim, {{including}} Coupe de Ville script on the <b>rear</b> <b>roof</b> pillar.
