2500|$|Before 1840 {{the firm}} had {{manufactured}} at least two steam engines, the first for Hayward of Yeovil, Somerset and the second for a mill in Glossop, Derbyshire. In that year they were successful in gaining much work {{in the manufacture of}} gas pipes and equipment for gasworks, a new and burgeoning industry. From 1842 until June 1847 the brothers were in partnership, as Galloways & Company, with Joseph Haley, in Manchester and Paris, as [...] "Manufacturers of Patent Screw or <b>Lifting</b> <b>Jacks,</b> and as Patentees of Machines for cutting, punching and compressing Metals, and of the Rivets and other articles constructed by the said last-mentioned Machines... as Cotton Banding Manufacturers". In that month the partnership was dissolved and the Galloways continued to manufacture the machines and rivets in Manchester and Haley continued with the rivets in Paris. By 1856 they had six of these machines in their factory and [...] manufactured two tons of rivets per machine per day, the devices being operated by one man and 20 boys. An example of a wooden-bodied Galloway-Haley <b>lifting</b> <b>jack</b> is in Museo del Ferrocarril (railway museum) in Madrid. The patents were Haley's; for example, patent number 8768 of 31 December 1840 for an improved <b>lifting</b> <b>jack</b> and compressor.|$|R
50|$|Leasing {{several of}} the roads inside the main building, LNWR Heritage can make use of 5 and 45 ton cranes, heavy <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks,</b> pit roads and {{dedicated}} workshop and paint shop facilities, aimed at providing a permanent base for their heritage rail engineering work {{for many years to}} come.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} {{layout of}} the building has been modified, with the installation of a partition protecting three of the internal roads from dirt and dust from the workshop areas. 5 ton cranes have been installed along with heavy <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks,</b> to expand the maintenance and overhaul capabilities of the site.|$|R
50|$|The route {{was little}} used {{for much of}} its history, and the entire line was {{abandoned}} on 31 March 1960. A short section west of the wye connection with the COR {{was used as a}} spur line to the local Domtar flakeboard plant. The remainder had its <b>rails</b> <b>lifted</b> starting in July 1960.|$|R
50|$|Finally, it also {{manufactures}} wheel {{sets for}} coaches and wagons. Jamalpur workshop {{was a significant}} supplier of cast-iron sleepers as well. Starting in 1961 it produced several rail cranes. It has also produced electric arc furnaces, ticket printers. The high-capacity synchronized <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks</b> known as Jamalpur Jacks were also produced by this workshop.|$|R

50|$|Haliburton was the {{northern}} terminus of the Victoria Railway (ex Canadian National Railway Haliburton subdivision) from Lindsay. The first railway train {{to arrive in}} Haliburton was on November 26, 1878 with John Albert Lucas (1860-1945) as the train engineer. The railway was abandoned and the <b>rails</b> <b>lifted</b> in 1980. The station remains and is now home to Rails End Gallery and Arts Centre.|$|R

50|$|The fire brigades {{may carry}} special tools for tram accidents, like heavy {{extrication}} tools, grounding equipment, and hydraulic <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks</b> for trams.

Within the depot itself Matterson <b>lifting</b> <b>jacks</b> were used to allow the changing of wheelsets and traction motors. Also a wallcrane {{for the removal of}} pantographs and other associated roof equipment from the fleet. The depot also had an underfloor wheel profiling machine located in a separate shed in No. 7 road.|$|R

60|$|In a few, {{years they}} {{realised}} better. In {{a little while}} no one thought anything of crossing an abyss on a wire, and the mono-rail was superseding the tram-lines, railways: and indeed every form of track for mechanical locomotion. Where land was cheap the rail ran along the ground, where it was dear the <b>rail</b> <b>lifted</b> up on iron standards and passed overhead; its swift, convenient cars went everywhere and did everything {{that had once been}} done along made tracks upon the ground.|$|R
50|$|Following the {{bankruptcy}} of the Pennsy's successor, the Penn Central company, the line became the property of Conrail in 1976. Conrail later sold the Middletown to Hagemans Crossing section to the Indiana and Ohio Railroad. The I&O operates freight service to Lebanon and Mason via the track and formerly operated an excursion train to Monroe from Mason. The track southeast of U.S. Route 42 at Hagemans Crossing has been abandoned, the <b>rails</b> <b>lifted,</b> and the right-of-way sold to the City of Lebanon.|$|R
50|$|Cuyahoga River Bridge #1 (previously {{known as}} the First Flats Rail Bridge) is a <b>rail</b> <b>lift</b> bridge that crosses the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, Ohio.

The bridge is of similar design to many of the other rail bridges in the Cleveland area.|$|R
