5|$|Tony Stark <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> New Year's Eve {{party in}} 1999 where he meets {{scientist}} Maya Hansen, {{the inventor of}} Extremis, an experimental regenerative treatment intended to allow recovery from crippling injuries. Disabled scientist Aldrich Killian offers them a place in his company Advanced Idea Mechanics, but Stark rejects the offer, humiliating Killian.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Mulder and Doggett agree to jump from the oil platform, which was shot {{in a way that}} <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> scene in the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, was filmed by having Patrick and Duchovny jump in front of a green screen. Separate footage of the rig exploding—created by {{combining}} actual shots of the rig with CGI—was then filmed, and the two shots were composited on top of one another.|$|E
5|$|The {{two policemen}} {{question}} five {{people in and}} around Rajan's house, {{most of whom are}} his family members or friends. The first to be questioned is Rajan's wife Usha, who is unable to speak because of her grief. Sivanandam and Naidu feel embarrassed and are reluctant to question her further. They begin interrogating Chinnaiah, who reported the gunshot. Chinnaiah proposes that the killer is probably Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother, and <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> confrontation between them: Pattabi asked for his share of the family property but Rajan refused his request, feeling {{that he and his wife}} would squander it. Chinnaiah concludes that this may have prompted Pattabi to kill Rajan.|$|E
40|$|Slepian, Masicampo, Toosi, and Ambady (2012, Experiment 1) {{reported}} that participants who <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> big secret estimated a hill as steeper than participants who <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> small secret. This finding was interpreted {{as evidence that}} secrets are experienced as physical burdens. In 2 experiments, we tried to replicate this finding, but, despite larger power, did not find a difference in slant estimates between participants who <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> big secret and those who <b>recalled</b> <b>a</b> small secret. This finding was further corroborated by a meta-analysis that included 8 published data sets of exact replications, which indicates that thinking of a big secret does not affect hill slant estimation. In a third experiment, we also failed to replicate the effect of <b>recalling</b> <b>a</b> secret on throwing a beanbag at a target (Slepian et al., 2012, Experiment 2). Together, our findings question the robustness of the original empirical findings...|$|R

5|$|Mulder has Melissa undergo {{regression}} hypnosis for her {{to recount}} her past lives. She implies that she and Mulder have met over their past lives, always to be separated or lost to each other. To confirm her events, Mulder has himself hypnotized and <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> {{time when he was}} a Jewish woman with a son, who had the same soul as his sister Samantha; his deceased father, who was Scully, is dead. Melissa was his husband in this life, and had been taken to a Nazi concentration camp by a Gestapo officer who was The Smoking Man. Mulder also recalls his past life from the Civil War, when he was a man named Sullivan Biddle, while Melissa was Sarah Kavanaugh; Scully, Mulder claims, was his sergeant. Scully finds pictures of Biddle and Kavanaugh in the county's hall of records and gives them to Mulder. He wears Confederate uniform in the photo.|$|E
5|$|The {{black and}} white {{sequences}} begin with Leonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller. Leonard has anterograde amnesia and is unable to store recent memories, {{the result of an}} attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name is John or James, with a last name starting with G. Leonard conducts his own investigation using a system of notes, Polaroids, and tattoos. From his occupation, Leonard <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> fellow anterograde amnesiac: Sammy Jankis. Sammy's diabetic wife, who wasn't sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested insulin; she hoped that he would remember having given her an injection and stop himself from giving another before she died of an overdose. However, Sammy continues to administer the injections, and his wife falls into a fatal coma.|$|E
5|$|The most manifestly {{cyclical}} work of {{the three}} sonatas is the Sonata in A major. In the sonata's scherzo, a joyous passage in C major is suddenly interrupted by a fierce downward rushing scale in C-sharp minor, which closely <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> parallel passage at {{the climax of the}} preceding movement; this is followed in the scherzo by a dance theme whose melody is derived from the Andantino's opening melody. This unique moment {{is one of the most}} explicit, audible cyclic references in the sonata trilogy. Another important cyclic element in the A major Sonata is the subtle similarities and connections that exist between each movement's ending and the following movement's opening; the connection between the opening and ending of the sonata as a whole, is even bolder: the sonata ends in a cancrizans of its opening, a framing device which is probably unprecedented in the sonata literature.|$|E

5|$|Starscream, {{having been}} humiliated {{at the hands}} of Megatron, infiltrates Shockwave's towers and sabotages his lab equipment. In the lab he finds Grimlock being held prisoner. He offers Grimlock freedom in {{exchange}} for his fealty, but Grimlock escapes by grabbing and throwing Starscream into the restraint controls, killing him. He reunites with his teammates Swoop, Slug, and Snarl; then proceeds to kill the defending Insecticons and the swarm leaders named Hardshell, Kickback and Sharpshot. Grimlock learns from Shockwave that their processors were tampered with, leaving Grimlock with a speech impairment. By way of his Space Bridge, Shockwave also found a new planet inhabited by large creatures; these were used to inspire all of their new alternate forms. Grimlock was further modified, and now cannot transform on command, but must be in a state of rage to do so. He <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> name that Sharpshot gave them, the Dinobots, and claims it as their new team name. Then he notices another Space Bridge tower that Shockwave has constructed nearby. Grimlock fights his way to Shockwave, biting his left arm off and rigging the tower to explode. The crumbling tower falls, killing Grimlock and Shockwave in the process and the portal in Cybertron's orbit begins to decay as the remaining three Dinobots watch in horror.|$|E
25|$|After Shoghi Effendi's death, Rúhíyyih Khanum {{published}} {{parts of}} her personal diaries to show glimpses of Shoghi Effendi's life. She <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> great deal of pain and suffering caused by his immediate family, and Bahá'ís in Haifa.|$|E
25|$|Lapskaus Boulevard in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> Norwegian enclave, {{which became}} mostly assimilated {{in the late}} 20th century. At its peak the area was home to 60,000 Norwegians. This {{neighborhood}} also hosted New York's principal Finnish enclave.|$|E

50|$|Participants who memorized foreign {{language}} words {{while listening to}} Baroque music <b>recalled</b> <b>an</b> average of 8.7% more words {{than those who did}} not listen to music. The effect of music was stronger for less common words, and there was no effect of music on <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> week later.|$|R

25|$|Three of the {{security}} forces members killed in this campaign were instead the victims of 7.62×51mm rounds. Five missed shots belonged to the same kind of weapon. Harnden <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> Belgian FN FAL rifle recovered by the Gardaí near Inniskeen in 1998 as the possible source of these bullets.|$|E
25|$|After that, Lola and Manni {{are shown}} {{lying in bed}} together. Lola <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> {{conversation}} with Manni about their love, and whether she wanted to leave him. The movie returns to the dying Lola. Her decision was to not leave Manni, and she doesn't want to die. The film then returns to their phone call.|$|E
25|$|Resting {{alone in}} Kwan's bungalow, Hamilton <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> {{passage from the}} Bhagavad Gita ("all is clouded by desire") which Billy told him. Kumar visits him and tells him about the failed coup attempt. Risking {{permanent}} damage to his eye, a heavily bandaged Hamilton implores Kumar to drive him to the airport, where he boards the last plane out of Jakarta and is reunited with Bryant.|$|E

40|$|<b>Recalling</b> <b>an</b> egoistic act nudges {{people to}} choose healthy over {{unhealthy}} food options. Conversely, participants preferred unhealthy over healthy food options when they <b>recalled</b> <b>an</b> altruistic deed. Consistent with this choice pattern participants {{were willing to}} pay more for healthy than for unhealthy options. This experiment extends the self-licensing literature...|$|R

25|$|In Chapter 3, Mrs Oliver fondly <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> copy of {{the book}} Enquire Within Upon Everything that had been owned by her Aunt Alice. This is also the book in a copy of which a will had been {{concealed}} in Hallowe'en Party. The book is best remembered today, however, as the inspiration for a program called ENQUIRE written in 1980 by Tim Berners-Lee and which anticipated the functionality of wikis.|$|E
25|$|A mysterious, {{wavering}} light, {{resembling a}} flame, flickers in the darkness. Mrs. O'Brien <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> lesson taught {{to her that}} people must choose to follow either the path of grace or the path of nature. In the 1960s or thereabouts, she receives a telegram informing her {{of the death of}} her son, R.L., aged nineteen. Mr. O'Brien is notified by telephone while at an airport. The family is thrown into turmoil.|$|E
25|$|As {{with female}} prostitutes, fees varied considerably. Athenaeus (VI, 241) {{mentions}} {{a boy who}} offers his favours for one obolus; again, the mediocrity of this price calls it into some doubt. Straton of Sardis, a writer of epigrams in the 2nd century, <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> transaction for five drachma (Palatine anthology, XII, 239). A letter of pseudo-Aeschines (VII, 3) estimates the earnings of one Melanopous at 3,000 drachma; probably through {{the length of his}} career.|$|E

25|$|Pattern {{completion}} is {{the ability}} to <b>recall</b> <b>an</b> entire memory from a partial or degraded sensory cue. Place cells are able to maintain a stable firing field even after significant signals are removed from a location, suggesting that they can <b>recall</b> <b>a</b> pattern from only some of the original input. Furthermore, pattern completion can be symmetric in that an entire memory can be retrieved from any part of it. For example, in an object-place association memory, spatial context can be used to <b>recall</b> <b>an</b> object and the object can be used to recall the spatial context.|$|R

25|$|Werewolves {{were said}} in European {{folklore}} to bear tell-tale physical traits {{even in their}} human form. These included the meeting of both eyebrows at {{the bridge of the}} nose, curved fingernails, low-set ears and a swinging stride. One method of identifying a werewolf in its human form was to cut the flesh of the accused, under the pretense that fur would be seen within the wound. A Russian superstition <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> werewolf can be recognised by bristles under the tongue.|$|E
25|$|The current organ was {{originally}} installed in 1973, {{although it is}} still housed in the old late Victorian organ case. It was rebuilt in 20023, with additions and re-fittings. The current chapel is open to members of all denominations. The current chaplain is Reverend Dr Dominic Keech, who also serves in a pastoral capacity. The Chapel also houses a portrait and a painting of one hand of the Childe of Hale, described in contemporary sources as man of 9 foot 3 inches in height. This <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> visit to the College on his return from a visit to London in 1617.|$|E
25|$|George, now {{convinced}} that Clarence is really his guardian angel, runs {{back to the}} bridge and begs for his life back; the alternate timeline changes {{back to the original}} reality. George runs home to await his arrest. Mary and Uncle Billy arrive, having rallied the townspeople, who donate more than enough to cover the missing $8,000 and for Potter's warrant to be torn up. Harry arrives and toasts George. A bell on the Christmas tree rings, and his daughter <b>recalls</b> <b>a</b> story that says the sound means that an angel has just earned his wings, signifying Clarence's promotion.|$|E
