5|$|Scholars {{generally}} compare Romeo's short-lived love of <b>Rosaline</b> {{with his}} later love of Juliet. The poetry Shakespeare writes for <b>Rosaline</b> is much weaker {{than that for}} Juliet. Scholars believe Romeo's early experience with <b>Rosaline</b> prepares him for his relationship with Juliet. Later performances of Romeo and Juliet have painted different pictures of Romeo and Rosaline's relationship, as filmmakers have experimented with making <b>Rosaline</b> a more visible character.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rosaline</b> is Lord Capulet's niece, Romeo's {{love in the}} {{beginning}} of the story.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} 18th and through the 19th century, {{criticism}} centred on debates over the moral message of the play. Actor and playwright David Garrick's 1748 adaptation excluded Rosaline: Romeo abandoning her for Juliet was seen as fickle and reckless. Critics such as Charles Dibdin argued that <b>Rosaline</b> had been purposely included in the play to show how reckless the hero was {{and that this was}} the reason for his tragic end. Others argued that Friar Laurence might be Shakespeare's spokesman in his warnings against undue haste. With the advent of the 20th century, these moral arguments were disputed by critics such as Richard Green Moulton: he argued that accident, and not some character flaw, led to the lovers' deaths.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{acknowledges}} its ridiculous nature, {{he refuses to}} stop loving her. [...] Psychoanalysts view this as a re-enactment of his failed relationship with his mother. [...] <b>Rosaline's</b> absence is symbolic of his mother's absence and lack of affection for him. [...] Romeo's love for Juliet is similarly hopeless, for she is a Capulet and Romeo pursues his relationship with her; the difference being that Juliet reciprocates. This does not seem likely seeing as his mother died of grief after his banishment, indicating that she probably loved him deeply.|$|R
5|$|On January 31, 2012, it was {{announced}} that Fox 2000, a division of 20th Century Fox, had optioned the rights to adapt John Green's novel The Fault in Our Stars for a feature film. Wyck Godfrey and Marty Bowen were due to produce the film with their production company, Temple Hill Entertainment. Stephen Chbosky, who directed The Perks of Being a Wallflower (also filmed in Pittsburgh), was in talks to direct the film but turned it down because of its similarity to Perks. On February 19, 2013, Josh Boone was hired as director; Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber were hired to adapt the novel into a screenplaytheir second adaptation for Fox, following <b>Rosaline.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{also uses}} sub-plots {{to offer a}} clearer view {{of the actions of}} the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with <b>Rosaline,</b> who has refused all of his advances. Romeo's infatuation with her stands in obvious {{contrast}} to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet's love and marriage. Paris' love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet's feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play's tragic end.|$|E
25|$|Courtneidge, {{the elder}} {{daughter}} and second of three children, {{was born in}} Sydney to a theatrical family, while her father was touring Australia with the J. C. Williamson company. The family returned to England in 1894. Her parents were the Scottish producer and actor Robert Courtneidge and his wife, <b>Rosaline</b> May (née Adams; stage name Rosie Nott). <b>Rosaline</b> {{was the daughter of}} the singer and actress Cicely Nott and the sister of three other actresses, including Ada Blanche, a well-known pantomime star. In 1901, at the age of eight, Courtneidge made her stage debut as the fairy Peaseblossom in her father's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Prince's Theatre, Manchester.|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, for example, shows Romeo {{attempting}} to love <b>Rosaline</b> {{in an almost}} contrived courtly fashion while Mercutio mocks him for it; and both in his plays and his sonnets the writer can be seen appropriating the conventions of courtly love for his own ends.|$|E
25|$|Shakespeare {{had several}} of his male {{characters}} address female characters as goddesses, including Demetrius to Helena in A Midsummer Night's Dream ("O Helen, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!"), Berowne to <b>Rosaline</b> in Love's Labour's Lost ("A woman I forswore; but I will prove, Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee"), and Bertram to Diana in All's Well That Ends Well. Pisanio also compares Imogen to a goddess to describe her composure under duress in Cymbeline.|$|E
25|$|Like most Shakespearean filmmakers, Cukor and his screenwriter Talbot Jennings cut {{much of the}} {{original}} script: playing around 45% of it. Many of these cuts are common ones in the theatre, such as the second appearance of the chorus and the comic scene of Peter with the musicians. Others are filmic: designed to replace words with action, or rearranging scenes in order to introduce groups of characters in longer narrative sequences. However, Jennings retains more of Shakespeare's poetry for the young lovers {{than any of his}} big-screen successors. Several scenes are interpolated, including three sequences featuring Friar John in Mantua. In contrast, the role of Friar Laurence (an important character in the play) is much reduced. A number of scenes are expanded as opportunities for visual spectacle, including the opening brawl (set against the backdrop of a religious procession), the wedding and Juliet's funeral. The party scene, choreographed by Agnes de Mille, includes <b>Rosaline</b> (an unseen character in Shakespeare's script) who rebuffs Romeo. The role of Peter is enlarged, and played by Andy Devine as a faint-hearted bully. He speaks lines which Shakespeare gave to other Capulet servants, making him the instigator of the opening brawl.|$|E
500|$|<b>Rosaline</b> {{has been}} portrayed {{in various ways}} over the centuries. Theophilus Cibber's 1748 version of Romeo and Juliet {{replaced}} references to <b>Rosaline</b> with references to Juliet. This, according to critics, took out the [...] "love at first sight" [...] moment at the Capulet feast. In the 1750s, actor and theatre director David Garrick also eliminated references to <b>Rosaline</b> from his performances, as many saw Romeo's quick replacement of her as immoral. However, in Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 film version of Romeo and Juliet, Romeo sees <b>Rosaline</b> (played by Paola Tedesco) first at the Capulet feast and then Juliet, of whom he becomes immediately enamoured. [...] This scene suggests that love is short and superficial. [...] <b>Rosaline</b> also appears in Renato Castellani's 1954 film version. [...] In a brief non-Shakespearean scene, <b>Rosaline</b> (Dagmar Josipovitch) gives Romeo a mask at Capulet's celebration, and urges him to leave disguised before harm comes to him. [...] Other filmmakers keep <b>Rosaline</b> off-camera in stricter accordance with Shakespeare's script. [...] <b>Rosaline</b> also appears in the 2013 film adaptation of Romeo & Juliet.|$|E
500|$|<b>Rosaline</b> is {{a variant}} of Rosalind, a name of Old French origin: (hros = [...] "horse", lind = [...] "soft, tender"). [...] When it was {{imported}} into English it {{was thought to be}} from the Latin rosa linda ("lovely rose"). Romeo sees <b>Rosaline</b> as the embodiment of the rose because of her name and her apparent perfections. The name <b>Rosaline</b> commonly appears in Petrarchan sonnets, a form of poetry Romeo uses to woo Juliet and to describe both <b>Rosaline</b> and Juliet. [...] Since <b>Rosaline</b> is unattainable, she is a perfect subject for this style; but Romeo's attempt at it is forced and weak. [...] By the time he meets Juliet his poetic ability has improved considerably.|$|E
500|$|Literary critics often compare Romeo's {{love for}} <b>Rosaline</b> with his {{feelings}} for Juliet. [...] Some see Romeo's supposed love for <b>Rosaline</b> as childish {{as compared with}} his true love for Juliet. [...] Others argue that the apparent difference in Romeo's feelings shows Shakespeare's improving skill. [...] Since Shakespeare {{is thought to have}} written early drafts of the play in 1591, and then picked them up again in 1597 to create the final copy, the change in Romeo's language for <b>Rosaline</b> and Juliet may mirror Shakespeare's increased skill as a playwright: the younger Shakespeare describing <b>Rosaline,</b> and the more experienced describing Juliet. [...] In this view, a careful look at the play reveals that Romeo's love for <b>Rosaline</b> is not as petty as usually imagined.|$|E
500|$|<b>Rosaline</b> ( [...] or [...] ) is {{an unseen}} {{character}} and niece of Capulet in William Shakespeare's tragedy Romeo and Juliet (1597). Although silent, her role is important. Romeo is at first deeply {{in love with}} <b>Rosaline</b> and expresses his dismay at her not loving him back. Romeo first spots Juliet while trying {{to catch a glimpse}} of <b>Rosaline</b> at a gathering hosted by the Capulet family.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{also note}} {{the ways in}} which Romeo's {{relationship}} with <b>Rosaline</b> prepares him for meeting Juliet. [...] Before meeting <b>Rosaline,</b> Romeo despises all Capulets, but afterwards looks upon them more favourably. [...] He experiences the dual feelings of hate and love in the one relationship. [...] This prepares him for the more mature relationship with Juliet—one fraught by the feud between Montagues and Capulets. Romeo expresses the conflict of love and hate in Act 1, Scene 1, comparing his love for <b>Rosaline</b> with the feud between the two houses: ...|$|E
500|$|Before Romeo meets Juliet, {{he loves}} <b>Rosaline,</b> Capulet's niece and Juliet's cousin. He {{describes}} her as wonderfully beautiful: [...] "The all-seeing sun / ne'er saw her match since first the world begun." [...] <b>Rosaline,</b> however, chooses to remain chaste; Romeo says: [...] "She hath forsworn to love, {{and in that}} vow / Do I live dead that live to tell it now." [...] This {{is the source of}} his depression, and he makes his friends unhappy; Mercutio comments: [...] "That same pale, hard-hearted wench, that <b>Rosaline,</b> torments him so that he will sure run mad." [...] Benvolio urges Romeo to sneak into a Capulet gathering where, he claims, <b>Rosaline</b> will look like [...] "a crow" [...] alongside the other beautiful women. Romeo agrees, but doubts Benvolio's assessment. After Romeo sees Juliet his feelings suddenly change: [...] "Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight / For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night." [...] Because their relationship is sudden and secret, Romeo's friends and Friar Laurence continue to speak of his affection for <b>Rosaline</b> throughout much of the play.|$|E
500|$|Robert Nathan's 1966 romantic comedy, Juliet in Mantua, {{presents}} <b>Rosaline</b> as a {{fully developed}} character. [...] In this sequel, in which Romeo and Juliet did not die, the pair live {{ten years later}} in exile in Mantua. [...] After they are forgiven and return to Verona, they learn that <b>Rosaline</b> is now married to County Paris, and both couples must confront their disillusionment with their marriages. [...] Another play, After Juliet, written by Scottish playwright Sharman Macdonald, {{tells the story of}} <b>Rosaline</b> after Romeo dies. A main character in this play, she struggles with her loss and turns away the advances of Benvolio, who has fallen in love with her. Macdonald's daughter, Keira Knightley, played <b>Rosaline</b> in the play's 1999 premiere. The 2012 young adult novel [...] "When You Were Mine" [...] by Rebecca Serle sets Rosaline's story in a contemporary high school. <b>Rosaline</b> and Romeo (renamed Rob) have been best friends since childhood and are just beginning to fall in love when Rosaline's cousin, Juliet, moves back into town and sets her sights on Rob. Important character in sequel named [...] "Plague on both your houses!" [...] (1994) by Grigori Gorin.|$|E
500|$|Gender studies {{critics have}} argued that Rosaline's name {{suggests}} that Romeo never really forgets her but rather replaces her with Juliet. [...] Thus, when Juliet cries [...] "What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet," [...] she is ironically expressing Romeo's own view {{of her as a}} substitute for <b>Rosaline.</b> [...] That is to say, <b>Rosaline,</b> replaced in name only by Juliet, is just as sweet to Romeo. Gender critics also note that the arguments used to dissuade Romeo from pursuing <b>Rosaline</b> are similar to the themes of Shakespeare's procreation sonnets. In these sonnets Shakespeare urges the man (who can be equated with Romeo) to find a woman with whom to procreate—a duty he owes to society. [...] <b>Rosaline,</b> it seems, is distant and unavailable except in the mind, similarly bringing no hope of offspring. [...] As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. [...] <b>Rosaline</b> reveals similarities to the subject of the sonnets when she refuses to break her vow of chastity. [...] Her name may be referred to in the first sonnet when the young man is described as [...] "beauties Rose." [...] This line ties the young man to both <b>Rosaline</b> and Romeo in Juliet's [...] "What's in a name?" [...] soliloquy. [...] When Juliet says [...] "...that which we call a rose / By any other name would smell as sweet", she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman.|$|E
500|$|Analysts {{note that}} <b>Rosaline</b> {{acts as a}} plot device, by {{motivating}} Romeo to sneak into the Capulet party where he will meet Juliet. Without her, their meeting would be unlikely. <b>Rosaline</b> thus acts as the impetus to bring the [...] "star-cross'd lovers" [...] to their deaths—she is crucial in shaping their fate (a common theme of the play). [...] Ironically, she remains oblivious of her role.|$|E
500|$|<b>Rosaline</b> {{is used as}} a {{name for}} only one other Shakespearean character—the one of the main female figures in Love's Labours Lost (1598), {{although}} Rosalind {{is the name of the}} main female character in As You Like It. [...] Scholars have found similarities between them: both are described as beautiful, and both have a way of avoiding men's romantic advances. <b>Rosaline</b> in Love's Labours Lost constantly rebuffs her suitor's advances and Romeo's <b>Rosaline</b> remains distant and chaste in his brief descriptions of her. [...] These similarities have led some to wonder whether they are based on a woman Shakespeare actually knew, possibly the Dark Lady described in his sonnets, but there is no strong evidence of this connection.|$|E
500|$|Psychoanalytic critics {{see signs}} of {{repressed}} childhood trauma in Romeo's love for <b>Rosaline.</b> She is of a rival house and is sworn to chastity. [...] Thus he is in an impossible situation, one which will continue his trauma if he remains in it.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Benvolio {{talks with}} his cousin Romeo, Montague's son, about Romeo's recent depression. Benvolio discovers that it stems from unrequited infatuation {{for a girl}} named <b>Rosaline,</b> one of Capulet's nieces. Persuaded by Benvolio and Mercutio, Romeo attends the ball at the Capulet house in hopes of meeting <b>Rosaline.</b> However, Romeo instead meets and {{falls in love with}} Juliet. Juliet's cousin, Tybalt, is enraged at Romeo for sneaking into the ball but is only stopped from killing Romeo by Juliet's father, who does not wish to shed blood in his house. After the ball, in what is now called the [...] "balcony scene", Romeo sneaks into the Capulet orchard and overhears Juliet at her window vowing her love to him in spite of her family's hatred of the Montagues. Romeo makes himself known to her and they agree to be married. With the help of Friar Laurence, who hopes to {{reconcile}} the two families through their children's union, they are secretly married the next day.|$|E
500|$|Still Star-Crossed (2017) – [...] period drama {{television}} series created by Heather Mitchell {{and based on}} the book with same name by Melinda Taub. It follows <b>Rosaline</b> (played by Lashana Lynch). She and Benvolio of Montague are betrothed against their will by Prince Escalus, to end the feud between the two families. Both resolve {{to find a way to}} end the violence without having the union.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} critics {{have found the}} {{character}} of Mercutio to have unacknowledged homoerotic desire for Romeo. Jonathan Goldberg examined the sexuality of Mercutio and Romeo utilising [...] "queer theory" [...] in Queering the Renaissance, comparing their friendship with sexual love. Mercutio, in friendly conversation, mentions Romeo's phallus, suggesting traces of homoeroticism. An example is his joking wish [...] "To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle ... letting it there stand / Till she had laid it and conjured it down." [...] Romeo's homoeroticism {{can also be found}} in his attitude to <b>Rosaline,</b> a woman who is distant and unavailable and brings no hope of offspring. As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. Shakespeare's procreation sonnets describe another young man who, like Romeo, is having trouble creating offspring and who may be seen as being a homosexual. Goldberg believes that Shakespeare may have used <b>Rosaline</b> as a way to express homosexual problems of procreation in an acceptable way. In this view, when Juliet says [...] "...that which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet", she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman.|$|E
500|$|Love's Labour's Lost, thought Hazlitt, [...] "transports us {{quite as}} much to the manners of the court, and the quirks of the courts of law, as to the scenes of nature or the fairy-land of [...] own imagination. Shakespear has set himself to imitate the tone of polite {{conversation}} then prevailing among the fair, the witty, and the learned". [...] "If we were to part with any of the author's comedies", he writes, [...] "it should be this." [...] Yet he also mentions many amusing characters, dramatic scenes, and noble lines of poetry he would not willingly part with, quoting at length long passages spoken by both Biron and by <b>Rosaline.</b>|$|E
500|$|Thomas Otway's The History and Fall of Caius Marius, one of {{the more}} extreme of the Restoration adaptations of Shakespeare, debuted in 1680. The scene is shifted from Renaissance Verona to ancient Rome; Romeo is Marius, Juliet is Lavinia, the feud is between patricians and plebeians; Juliet/Lavinia wakes from her potion before Romeo/Marius dies. Otway's version was a hit, and was acted for the next seventy years. His {{innovation}} in the closing scene was even more enduring, and was used in adaptations throughout the next 200 years: Theophilus Cibber's adaptation of 1744, and David Garrick's of 1748 both used variations on it. These versions also eliminated elements deemed inappropriate at the time. For example, Garrick's version transferred all language describing <b>Rosaline</b> to Juliet, to heighten the idea of faithfulness and downplay the love-at-first-sight theme. In 1750, a [...] "Battle of the Romeos" [...] began, with Spranger Barry and Susannah Maria Arne (Mrs. Theophilus Cibber) at Covent Garden versus David Garrick and George Anne Bellamy at Drury Lane.|$|E
500|$|Shakespeare uses {{a variety}} of poetic forms {{throughout}} the play. He begins with a 14-line prologue {{in the form of}} a Shakespearean sonnet, spoken by a Chorus. Most of Romeo and Juliet is, however, written in blank verse, and much of it in strict iambic pentameter, with less rhythmic variation than in most of Shakespeare's later plays. In choosing forms, Shakespeare matches the poetry to the character who uses it. Friar Laurence, for example, uses sermon and sententiae forms, and the Nurse uses a unique blank verse form that closely matches colloquial speech. Each of these forms is also moulded and matched to the emotion of the scene the character occupies. For example, when Romeo talks about <b>Rosaline</b> earlier in the play, he attempts to use the Petrarchan sonnet form. Petrarchan sonnets were often used by men to exaggerate the beauty of women who were impossible for them to attain, as in Romeo's situation with <b>Rosaline.</b> This sonnet form is used by Lady Capulet to describe Count Paris to Juliet as a handsome man. When Romeo and Juliet meet, the poetic form changes from the Petrarchan (which was becoming archaic in Shakespeare's day) to a then more contemporary sonnet form, using [...] "pilgrims" [...] and [...] "saints" [...] as metaphors. Finally, when the two meet on the balcony, Romeo attempts to use the sonnet form to pledge his love, but Juliet breaks it by saying [...] "Dost thou love me?" [...] By doing this, she searches for true expression, rather than a poetic exaggeration of their love. Juliet uses monosyllabic words with Romeo but uses formal language with Paris. Other forms in the play include an epithalamium by Juliet, a rhapsody in Mercutio's Queen Mab speech, and an elegy by Paris. Shakespeare saves his prose style most often for the common people in the play, though at times he uses it for other characters, such as Mercutio. Humour, also, is important: scholar Molly Mahood identifies at least 175 puns and wordplays in the text. Many of these jokes are sexual in nature, especially those involving Mercutio and the Nurse.|$|E
500|$|Gemma Arterton as MI6 agent Strawberry Fields, {{who works}} at the British {{consulate}} in Bolivia. Fields, who is merely an office worker as described by M, takes herself seriously and tries to overpower Bond when the pair meet. She is later seduced by Bond, infiltrates Greene's fund raiser party with him and ends up paying the ultimate price. Forster found Arterton a witty actress and selected her from a reported 1,500 candidates. One of the casting directors asked her to audition for the role, having seen her portray <b>Rosaline</b> in Love's Labour's Lost at the Globe Theatre. Arterton said Fields was [...] "not so frolicsome" [...] as other Bond girls, but is instead [...] "fresh and young, not... a femme fatale." [...] Arterton described Fields as a homage to the 1960s Bond girls, comparing her red wig to that of Diana Rigg, who played Tracy Bond in On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Rigg, alongside Honor Blackman, is one of her favourite Bond girls. Arterton had to film her character's death scene first day on the set, where she was completely covered head to toe in non-toxic black paint. Although she found the experience unpleasant, she believes the scene will be an iconic part of the film. The character's full name, which is a reference to the Beatles song [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever", is never actually uttered on screen; when Bond asks her for her name, she replies, [...] "Just Fields." [...] Robert A. Caplen suggests that this is a conscious effort to portray a woman [...] "whose character attributes are neither undermined nor compromised" [...] by her name, even though her name may have sexual overtones reminiscent of earlier Bond girls.|$|E
2500|$|In Love's Labours Lost <b>Rosaline</b> says [...] "Better wits {{have worn}} plain Statute Caps.". [...] This is {{believed}} to be a reference to events in Henley during the writing of that play, before its publication, when the denizens of Henley were prosecuted in the court leet for being in breach of a statute (enacted with the aim of ensuring economic support for the wool industry) that required the wearing of woollen caps on Sundays and other holy days.|$|E
2500|$|In 1925, Courtneidge {{returned}} {{briefly to}} acting. After a tryout {{at his old}} Manchester theatre, the Prince's, he brought the old farce On 'Change to the Savoy, winning good notices for his performance in the leading role of a vain and touchy Scottish professor, which he had first played in the 1880s. Although Cicely had made her career away from his management since World War I, Courtneidge regularly featured his younger daughter <b>Rosaline</b> in his casts, in such plays as The Sport of Kings (1924) and The Unfair Sex (1925), until her early death in 1926 {{at the age of}} 23.|$|E
2500|$|Courtneidge's {{wife was}} <b>Rosaline</b> May née Adams (stage name Rosie Nott). She was the {{daughter}} of the singer and actress Cicely Nott and the sister of three other actresses including Ada Blanche, a well-known pantomime star. In 1892 Courtneidge and his wife went to Australia, where he played comic roles for George Edwardes's Gaiety company in the burlesques, Carmen up to Data, Faust up to Date, Miss Esmeralda and Joan of Arc. He and his wife remained in Australia during 1893 and 1894; he joined the J. C. Williamson company, appearing in On 'Change, La Mascotte, Sweet Lavender and Princess Ida and in pantomime. His daughter Cicely was born while {{he and his wife were}} in Sydney.|$|E
2500|$|In 1920, Courtneidge {{presented}} the non-musical comedy Paddy the Next Best Thing at the Savoy Theatre. The reviewer of The Times expressed {{the hope that}} people in Ireland would not hear of the show: [...] "Ireland has enough grievances to go on with". Nevertheless, the play was a popular success, and ran for 867 performances. Following this, Courtneidge took a touring company to Australia, presenting a repertory of comedies including The Man from Toronto, Somerset Maugham's Home and Beauty, and a work by an Australian author, Saving Grace. Among the company members was Courtneidge's younger daughter <b>Rosaline.</b> He returned to England {{by way of the}} US, where he presented [...] Paddy the Next Best Thing in New York. Alexander Woollcott in The New York Times was no more laudatory than his critical counterpart in London, but the play ran well.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} book Laurents wrote closely {{adhered to}} Romeo and Juliet, but the characters based on <b>Rosaline</b> {{and the parents}} of the doomed lovers were eliminated early on. Later the scenes related to Juliet's faking her death and committing suicide also were deleted. Language posed a problem; four-letter curse words were uncommon in the theater at the time, and slang expressions were avoided for fear they would be dated by the time the production opened. Laurents ultimately invented what sounded like real street talk but actually was not: [...] "cut the frabba-jabba", for example. Sondheim converted long passages of dialogue, and sometimes just a simple phrase like [...] "A boy like that would kill your brother", into lyrics. With the help of Oscar Hammerstein, Laurents convinced Bernstein and Sondheim to move [...] "One Hand, One Heart", which he considered too pristine for the balcony scene, to the scene set in the bridal shop, and as a result [...] "Tonight" [...] was written to replace it. Laurents felt that the building tension needed to be alleviated in order to increase the impact of the play's tragic outcome, so comic relief in the form of Officer Krupke was added to the second act. He was outvoted on other issues: he felt the lyrics to [...] "America" [...] and [...] "I Feel Pretty" [...] were too witty for the characters singing them, but they stayed in the score and proved to be audience favorites. Another song, [...] "Kid Stuff", was added and quickly removed during the Washington, D.C. tryout when Laurents convinced the others it was helping tip the balance of the show into typical musical comedy.|$|E
