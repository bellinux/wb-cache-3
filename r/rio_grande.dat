5|$|Manuel Marques de Sousa {{was born}} on 13 June 1804 (sometimes erroneously given as 1805) in <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande.</b> The town was located in <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul, a {{southern}} captaincy (later province) of Brazil, then part of the Portuguese Colonial Empire. His parents were Manuel Marques de Sousa and Senhorinha Inácia da Silveira. He had four younger siblings: two sisters and two brothers. An archetypal leading family of <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul, Marques de Sousa's Portuguese-descended family was wealthy and influential, owning ranches and huge cattle herds. His father and his paternal grandfather, both also named Manuel Marques de Sousa, were seasoned soldiers {{who took part in}} the colonial wars. His grandfather, the elder Marques de Sousa, was the wealthiest person in <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul.|$|E
5|$|On 23 July 1840, PedroII was {{declared}} {{of age and}} Joaquim Inácio was among the naval officers representing the armada in the delegation that greeted the young emperor. The rise of PedroII to head the central government resulted in a slow, but steady, restoration of order in the country. On 17 December, Joaquim Inácio was named inspetor do arsenal de marinha (inspector of the navy shipyard) in <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande,</b> {{the second most important}} town in <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul. The province was still troubled by the Ragamuffin rebellion. He led the sailors manning the trenches surrounding <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> and fought the Ragamuffins when they attacked the town in July 1841.|$|E

5|$|Rail traffic through Thistle {{continued}} to increase as the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> cooperated with connecting railroads, making the rail line through Thistle a bridge line for transcontinental rail traffic. The growth of Thistle was {{closely tied to the}} success of the Denver and <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> Railroad throughout the era of steam locomotives.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} link to Aspen {{was therefore}} {{likely to be}} highly profitable, and two railroads, the Colorado Midland and the Denver & <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> Western, hoped to be the first. In the early 1880s, however, neither seemed able to do so. The Midland was a paper railroad with no money to build anything. The <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> was building, but too quickly, forcing it into receivership. Financially cautious from its recent troubles, it chose not to build to Aspen despite its president's enthusiasm for the project.|$|E
5|$|About 18 percent (40,000) of the Uruguayan {{population}} (220,000) spoke Portuguese {{and regarded}} themselves as Brazilian rather than Uruguayan. Many within Flores' ranks were Brazilians, some hailing {{from the nearby}} Brazilian province of <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul. Life along the frontier between <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul and Uruguay was often chaotic, with hostilities erupting between partisans of various cattle barons, cattle-rustling and random killings. Large landowners {{on both sides of}} the border had long been antagonistic toward Berro's policies. The Uruguayan president attempted to tax the cattle coming from <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul and to impose curbs on the use of Brazilian slaves within Uruguayan territory; slavery had been outlawed years before in Uruguay.|$|E

A tropical storm warning was posted for coastal Texas from Baffin Bay northward to Port O'Connor. Governor of Texas Rick Perry declared a state of disaster in 19 counties and ordered the deployment of Texas Military Forces personnel (including 80 citizen-soldiers of the Texas State Guard Medical Brigade) to the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> Valley.

5|$|During the Brazilian Revolution of 1930, Bahia {{served with}} <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul—until that ship defected—and {{five or six}} destroyers {{off the coast of}} Santa Catarina; they were once again {{commanded}} by Belford Gomes. Two years later, when the state of São Paulo rebelled in the Constitutionalist Revolution, Bahia—under the command of Frigate Captain Lucas Alexandre Boiteux—and other vessels blockaded the rebel-held port of Santos. Bahia was under repair from 1934 into 1935. In November 1935, Bahia and <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul sailed to Natal, the capital of <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Norte, to lend support against another rebellion. As part of their mission, they were ordered to sink the steamship Santos on sight, as several escaping leaders of the revolution were on board.|$|E
5|$|In December 1864, the {{dictator}} of Paraguay, Francisco Solano López, ordered {{the invasion of}} the Brazilian province of Mato Grosso (currently the state of Mato Grosso do Sul), triggering the Paraguayan War. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded Argentine territory in preparation for an attack on <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul. The situation in <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul was chaotic, and the local military commanders were incapable of mounting an effective resistance to the Paraguayan army. The Baron of Porto Alegre offered to return to active duty, and on 21 July 1865, the government gave him command of the Brazilian land forces in <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul. He set out for Uruguaiana, a small town in the province's west, where the Paraguayan army was besieged by a combined force of Brazilian, Argentine and Uruguayan units.|$|E

2500|$|These first {{settlers}} included {{tribes of}} Ilongots (Egungot) or Italons, Abaca and Buquids. Settlements were built {{along the banks}} following the river's undulations. The Ilongots , meaning people of the forest, were the fierce headhunters and animist tribes who occupied Carranglan and the mountainous terrain of Sierra Madre and Caraballo. The head hunting communities were nestled along the riverbanks of <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande's</b> tributaries in the north. Abaca and Italon were subgroups of Ilongots meaning river settlers. Ilongots survived mainly by fishing and hunting. Food production was a secondary occupation. The agriculture-based community of Caraclans and Buquids [...] were settled in Bongabon and Pantabangan along the riverbanks of <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande's</b> tributaries in the northeast.|$|R

5|$|David Moffat {{became the}} Rio Grande's {{president}} in 1885 and persuaded the company's other executives {{to go ahead}} with the Aspen connection. To overcome the Midland's lead, they built a narrow-gauge line on the north side of the Roaring Fork, today the route of the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> Trail. Both the gauge and the elimination of the Maroon Creek crossing, which was causing complications for the Midland, saved considerable time, and the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> managed to bring the first train to Aspen in October 1887. Working through the winter, the Midland finished the Maroon Creek Bridge and got its standard gauge line into Aspen five months later.|$|E
5|$|Lundomys molitor {{has been}} found as a living animal only in Uruguay and nearby <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul; records of live {{specimens}} from eastern Argentina and Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais, have not been confirmed. It is rarely encountered, and has been collected in only one location in <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul, but {{this may be due}} to insufficient efforts to locate it, rather than genuine rarity. Its distribution is generally limited to areas with mean winter temperatures over , mean annual temperatures over , annual rainfall over , and a long rainy season averaging over 200 days. It is usually found in swamps or near streams.|$|E

40|$|The International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC) is {{responsible}} for maintaining a series of flood-control projects beginning in New Mexico and extending along the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande’s</b> international border dividing the United States and Mexico. A review by the USIBWC indicates that, over time, the flood-control capability of the levees has been compromised. Recent flood events along the international border, resulting in significant economic damages and loss of human life, emphasized {{the need for a}} timely assessment of impacts of potential flood-control failure. Given a short project time line mandated by IBWC and the large geographic extent of the river and floodwaylevee system (stretching from Caballo Reservoir in New Mexico to the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande’s</b> mouth, near Brownsville, TX.), innovative methods were developed to conduct a rapid and preliminary economic assessment of the flood-control infrastructure...|$|R

The size of agricultural lands could become more variable, with loss of irrigated agriculture in district 025 of the Mexican lower <b>Río</b> Bravo/Río <b>Grande,</b> due to increasing water demand from domestic, industrial, commercial, and municipal sectors in the municipalities bordering the <b>Río</b> Bravo/Río <b>Grande,</b> magnified by drought and the development of water demand of the Conchos river...|$|R
