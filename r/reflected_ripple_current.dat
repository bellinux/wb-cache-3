40|$|The latest {{generation}} of long life, space pulse-tube cryocoolers require electronics capable of controlling self-induced vibration {{down to a}} fraction of a newton and coldhead temperature with high accuracy down to a few kelvin. Other functions include engineering diagnostics, heater and valve control, telemetry and safety protection of the cryocooler subsystem against extreme environments and operational anomalies. The electronics are designed to survive the thermal, vibration, shock and radiation environment of launch and orbit, while providing a design life in excess of 10 years on-orbit. A number of our current generation high reliability radiation-hardened electronics units are in various stages of integration on several space flight payloads. This paper describes the features and performance of our latest flight electronics designed for the pulse-tube cryocooler that is the pre-cooler for a closed cycle Joule-Thomson cooler providing 6 K cooling for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid Infra-Red Instrument (MIRI). The electronics is capable of highly accurate temperature control over the temperature range from 4 K to 15 K. Self-induced vibration is controlled to low levels on all harmonics up to the 16 th.

40|$|Small Wind Energy Conversion Systems (WECSs) are {{becoming}} an attractive option for distributed energy generation. WECSs use permanent magnet synchronous generators (PMSGs) directly coupled {{to the wind}} turbine and connected to the grid through a single-phase grid-tie converter. The loading produced on the DC-link is characterized by large <b>ripple</b> <b>currents</b> at twice the grid frequency. These <b>ripple</b> <b>currents</b> are <b>reflected</b> through the DC bus into the PMSG, causing increased heating and ripple torque. In this paper, the PMSG inverter is used to control the DC link voltage. In order to avoid <b>reflecting</b> the <b>ripple</b> <b>currents</b> into the PMSG, the feedback DC-link voltage is passed through a filter. The Butterworth filters, notch filters, antiresonant filter (ARF) and moving average filter (MAF) are considered. For a fair comparison, formulas are provided to tune the filter parameters so that DC-link voltage control will achieve the selected bandwidth. The different filtering options produce different levels of torque ripple reduction. Notch Filter, ARF and MAF obtain the best results {{and there is a}} trade-off between the filter implementation complexity, bandwidth, overshoot and the torque ripple reduction. Simulations and experiments using a 2. 5 kW PMSG turbine generator validate the proposals...|$|R

A simple analog circuit is designed to extract the PWM <b>ripple</b> <b>current</b> via a bandpass (BP) filter and a root-mean-square (RMS) detector for fault detection. In addition, this method can also identify the faulted phase, which can be used for fault mitigation strategies.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} changes in the <b>ripple</b> <b>current</b> for an {{electrolytic}} capacitor used in the dc-side of a single-phase rectifier circuit when subjected to input voltage fluctuations. The study has been undertaken in order to analyse the potential impact on capacitor lifetime. The key effect is that the capacitor <b>ripple</b> <b>current,</b> as a consequence of voltage fluctuations, increases dramatically and this phenomenon keeps deteriorating as the frequency of the voltage fluctuations increases. Simulations and experimental work confirm this phenomenon. Since the power loss and temperature rise are dependent on the capacitor equivalent series resistance (ESR) and <b>ripple</b> <b>current</b> components, an increase in <b>ripple</b> <b>current</b> under voltage fluctuation conditions is likely to accelerate this process, resulting in a reduced lifetime...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Switching power supplies, due {{to their}} {{high-frequency}} switching operation, draw {{a substantial amount of}} input <b>ripple</b> <b>current.</b> Such <b>ripple</b> <b>current</b> manifests itself as electromagnetic interference (EMI). Active and passive ripple cancellation methods have been proposed in the past. This paper discusses the cancellation methods, and classifies the basic circuit configurations for <b>ripple</b> <b>current</b> cancellation. The basis of discussion is a “nullification ” process, which can be described effectively in terms of the ideal circuit element nullor. The initial focus is on differential-mode noise cancellation, but the basic technique can be applied equally to cancelling common-mode noise. The classification provides a clear guideline for synthesizing practical cancellation circuits. Both active and passive implementation examples are given and experimentally demonstrated.
