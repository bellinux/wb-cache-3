5|$|In 1933, Truman {{was named}} Missouri's {{director}} for the Federal <b>Re-Employment</b> program (part of the Civil Works Administration) {{at the request of}} Postmaster General James Farley. This was payback to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. The appointment confirmed Pendergast's control over federal patronage jobs in Missouri and marked the zenith of his power. It also created a relationship between Truman and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins and assured Truman's avid support for the New Deal.|$|E
5|$|Maids' representatives {{said that}} when the waiver was announced, the {{guidelines}} were unclear and had no implementation date. Employers deferred contracts or dismissed workers pending confirmation of the effective date, leaving them in limbo. They protested the uncertainty, demanding an increase in their minimum wage to HK$4,000. Employers reportedly began terminating their helpers' contracts, stoking fears of mass terminations. On 20 July Secretary for Labour and Welfare Matthew Cheung announced that the waiver commencement date would be moved up by one month, and the Immigration Department temporarily relaxed its 14-day <b>re-employment</b> requirement for helpers whose contracts had expired.|$|E

25|$|The ban was {{eventually}} lifted by the incoming Labour government in 1997, with the Government Communications Group of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) being formed to represent interested employees at all grades.

25|$|When, in August 1980, Anna Walentynowicz {{lost her}} job at the Gdańsk Shipyard because of her {{position}} as editor of the underground newspaper Robotnik Wybrzeze, her fellow workers took action. Around 16,000 employees of the shipyard discontinued their work and occupied its premises on the morning of August 14, demanding Walentynowicz’s <b>re-employment,</b> the erection of a monument in honor of the victims of the strikes of 1970, and a pay rise of 2000 zlotys, amongst other things. After negotiating with management and having most of their demands met, a vote was taken on August 16 leading to the strike being called off. By this time, however, many of the workers at facilities surrounding the Gdańsk Shipyard had begun their own strikes making similar demands, and it was decided that in solidarity with them, the workers in the shipyard would continue to strike despite their own demands having been met. By the next morning the Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Polish shorthand: MKS) had been formed within the gates of the shipyard, intending to unite workers in the Gdańsk-Sopot-Gdynia area, coordinating action and maintaining and order {{to ensure the safety of}} the strikers. Lech Wałęsa, an electrician who had lost his job at the Gdańsk Shipyard in the strikes of 1976 was elected as chair of the MKS, while the remainder of the committee was composed of delegates from other facilities including Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda, and others. By August 18, the MKS represented workers from 156 separate enterprises, and the number was steadily growing. Just two days after the formation of MKS the Polish economy was brought to a standstill as workers struck at factories and ports all along the Baltic coast. By August 21, much of the country was affected by strikes, even including the inland mines of the Upper Silesian Industrial Area, as more and more workers joined independent unions. The Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee at Gdańsk was becoming the national center for trade union movement: a phenomenon which was itself unique to this series of events. In the strikes of the 1950s and ‘70s it was the lack of a central organized structure that had limited the mobilization potential of striking workers. Now the MKS had been specifically designed with this problem in mind - the decentralization of the workers’ movement – and was working for the first time to unify and strengthen the movement, coordinating strikes all across Poland. It was for this reason that the government of Edward Gierek found they could no longer buy off strikers with small concessions, and finally had to settle into heavy negotiations with the MKS.|$|E
500|$|... "The Revenge" [...] is {{the seventh}} {{episode of the}} second season of the NBC sitcom Seinfeld, and the show's 12th episode overall. The story {{revolves}} around George Costanza's (Jason Alexander) plot to exact revenge on his boss, with his friend Elaine Benes' (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) help, after he quits his job at Rick Barr Properties and is refused <b>re-employment.</b> Meanwhile, Jerry (Jerry Seinfeld) and his neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) get even with a laundromat owner—who they believe has stolen money from Jerry—by pouring cement {{into one of his}} washing machines.|$|E

He also apologised for any grievances he had caused due to his rape case, but maintained his innocence. Journalist Henry Winter, writing for The Daily Telegraph, refuted Evans' claims, instead saying that [...] "it was people’s disgust that a convicted rapist felt he could swan back into a high-profile job after revealing no remorse for a crime that would preclude <b>re-employment</b> for many", while criticising Evans for making [...] "his statement of contrition ... on the offensive, legally questionable website that continues to make life miserable for his victim".|$|E
500|$|Flanders {{met with}} President Roosevelt on several occasions. He felt that Roosevelt and his advisors did not heed Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox’s warning {{that it was}} “easily {{possible}} that hostilities would be initiated by a surprise attack upon the fleet or the Naval Base at Pearl Harbor.” He further faulted the president for failing to recognize the growing threat of Communism in China. In Flanders’s opinion, he sold out on Mongolia, Nationalist China and Central Europe to Communist powers at the 1943 Tehran Conference. Flanders recognized the president’s political genius and leadership skills, but deplored his advocacy of raising taxes. He characterized the Roosevelt philosophy as one where <b>re-employment</b> “must come from Government—not private—action.” [...] Flanders felt that large social programs were an ineffective approach to solve national problems.|$|E
500|$|After {{the opening}} Paris run and the London performances, events conspired {{to prevent further}} stagings of the ballet. Nijinsky's choreography, which Kelly {{describes}} as [...] "so striking, so outrageous, so frail as to its preservation", did not appear again until {{attempts were made to}} reconstruct it in the 1980s. On 19 September 1913 Nijinsky married Romola de Pulszky while the Ballets Russes was on tour without Diaghilev in South America. When Diaghilev found out he was distraught and furious that his lover had married, and dismissed Nijinsky. Diaghilev was then obliged to re-hire Fokine, who had resigned in 1912 because Nijinsky had been asked to choreograph Faune. Fokine made it a condition of his <b>re-employment</b> that none of Nijinsky's choreography would be performed. In a letter to the art critic and historian Alexandre Benois, Stravinsky wrote, [...] "he possibility has gone for some time of seeing anything valuable in the field of dance and, still more important, of again seeing this offspring of mine".|$|E

2500|$|Psychiatrist Major Wilfred Bion and {{psychologist}} Lieutenant Colonel Eric Trist conducted work at No. 21 War Office Selection Board (WOSB), Selsdon Court Hotel, Surrey {{where they}} attempted to adapt officer selection methods {{to the purpose of}} selecting POWs who might be capable of returning to active service. The [...] "officer reception unit" [...] was intended to 'provide them with advice on military retraining and <b>re-employment,</b> and on other problems.' Bion suggested that resettlement should use 'psychiatric machinery; but the machinery need not cause irritation by creaking' and so any programme for handling POWs should appear more military than medical though it should incorporate psychiatric treatment in a subtle manner.|$|E
2500|$|Beginning in 1923 and {{continuing}} {{until at least}} 1933, Hammond was {{also a member of}} University of Michigan Board in Control of Athletics. [...] Hammond served {{as the president of the}} Illinois Manufacturers' Association for the first several months of 1933. [...] He resigned the position in July 1933 to serve in the Franklin Roosevelt administration as the executive director of the emergency <b>re-employment</b> campaign of the National Recovery Administration ("NRA"). [...] Hammond resigned from his NRA position in November 1933. [...] Immediately before his resignation, it was reported that Hammond disagreed with the administration's policy of giving powers to NRA boards that would weaken industry's self government. [...] On the day Hammond's resignation was announced, fellow Chicago industrialist J.L. Kraft of Kraft Cheese Corp. stated that the NRA was run by [...] "hairbrained professors, most of them with communistic tendencies who could not successfully operate a peanut stand." [...] While initially denying any difference of opinion with the NRA, Hammond later stated that he found the economic principles of the New Deal to be incompatible with his own, commenting that NRA means [...] "Nuts Run America." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Palme cabinet {{was also}} {{active in the}} field of education, {{introducing}} such reforms as a system of loans and benefits for students, regional universities, and preschool for all children. [...] Under a law of 1970, in the upper secondary school system “gymnasium,” “fackskola” and vocational “yrkesskola” were integrated to form one school with 3 sectors (arts and social science, technical and natural sciences, economic and commercial). In 1975, a law was passed that established free admission to universities. A number of reforms were also carried out to enhance workers' rights. An employment protection Act of 1974 introduced rules regarding consultation with unions, notice periods, and grounds for dismissal, together with priority rules for dismissals and <b>re-employment</b> in case of redundancies. That same year, work-environment improvement grants were introduced and made available to modernising firms “conditional upon the presence of union-appointed ‘safety stewards’ to review the introduction of new technology with regard to {{the health and safety of}} workers.” In 1976, an Act on co-determination at work was introduced that allowed unions to be consulted at various levels within companies before major changes were enforced that would affect employees, while management had to negotiate with labour for joint rights in all matters concerning organisation of work, hiring and firing, and key decisions affecting the workplace.|$|E
2500|$|It was, Rehnquist wrote, {{necessary}} {{to establish a}} test for future such cases. He looked {{to other areas of}} the law to formulate one. In two prior criminal cases, Lyons v. Oklahoma and Parker v. North Carolina the Court had allowed the use of later confessions or statements by defendants even where earlier ones had been coercively obtained as long as the later statements appeared otherwise voluntarily given. [...] "While the type of causation on which the taint cases turn may differ somewhat from that which we apply here, those cases do suggest that the proper test to apply in the present context is one which likewise protects against the invasion of constitutional rights without commanding undesirable consequences not {{necessary to}} the assurance of those rights." [...] Since Doyle had met his burden of showing that one of the actions for which the board terminated him was constitutionally protected speech, [...] "the District Court should have gone on to determine whether the Board had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have reached the same decision as to respondent's <b>re-employment</b> {{even in the absence of}} the protected conduct." [...] The Court could not determine this from the available record, so it vacated the Sixth Circuit and remanded the case to District Court to facilitate that inquiry.|$|E
2500|$|The {{program had}} both its merits and its downsides. [...] On the {{positive}} side, {{in the field}} of rehabilitation alone, thousands of crippled miners had been restored to usefulness and <b>re-employment.</b> [...] Dr. Draper wrote in a 1953 article, [...] "the arduous, costly task of restoring men with crushed limbs and backs in the terrible toll of the coal mines is one of the finest chapters in the history of medicine." [...] On the negative side, with a program of this extent there were physicians who were not competent to provide the quality of service needed, and those who rendered needless or poorly advised services. [...] Some physicians had a monopoly on certain services in certain areas and charged exorbitant fees, while others took advantage of emergency situations, charging coal miners rates that they would charge their wealthiest clients. [...] Nevertheless, Draper wrote in 1953, the physicians associated with the fund had done a great amount to improve the standard of medical practice in coal mining areas. [...] Overall, the program was considered to be a success; so successful, in fact, that in 1956 it was given the Albert Lasker Group Award. [...] While the fund continued to serve miners for decades to come, it was forced to give up its hospitals in 1964 from rising costs that it could no longer control.|$|E
2500|$|Rocker {{decided to}} stay in London. He {{got a job as}} the {{librarian}} of the Communist Workers' Educational Union, where he got to know Louise Michel and Errico Malatesta, two influential anarchists. Inspired to visit the quarter after reading about [...] "Darkest London" [...] in the works of John Henry Mackay, he was appalled by the poverty he witnessed in the predominantly Jewish East End. He joined the Jewish anarchist Arbeter Fraint group he had obtained information about from his French comrades, quickly becoming a regular lecturer at its meetings. There, he met his lifelong companion Milly Witkop, a Ukrainian-born Jew who had fled to London in 1894. In May 1897, having lost his job and with little chance of <b>re-employment,</b> Rocker was persuaded by a friend to move to New York. Witkop agreed to accompany him and they arrived on the 29th. They were, however, not admitted into the country, because they were not legally married. They refused to formalize their relationship. Rocker explained that their [...] "bond is one of free agreement between my wife and myself. It is a purely private matter that only concerns ourselves, and it needs no confirmation from the law." [...] Witkop added: [...] "Love is always free. When love ceases to be free it is prostitution." [...] The matter received front-page coverage in the national press. The Commissioner-General of Immigration, the former Knights of Labor President Terence V. Powderly, advised the couple to get married to settle the matter, but they refused and were deported back to England on the same ship they had arrived on.|$|E
50|$|On 11 August 2011, MOE and the Teachers' Unions {{issued a}} joint {{statement}} on their agreement to use the tripartite guidelines on <b>re-employment</b> when implementing the Public Service-wide terms of <b>re-employment.</b> MOE, with assistance from the Unions, will draw up guidelines for schools regarding the job duties and responsibilities of re-employed teachers.
