Methods. Blood samples of 1250 couple spouses were tested for HBsAg and anti-HBs. HBsAg positive cases' fiancées which were found HBV negative were administered a rapid three-dose vaccination scheme on days 0, 7, and 21. Forty controls with similar age and gender were also were administered three doses of the same vaccine. Results. Out of 1250 cases (625 couples), 46 (3. 6 %) were HBsAg positive, and 40 of them aged between 18 and 39 were admitted to the <b>rapid</b> <b>vaccination</b> program. Conclusion. Upon determination of HBsAg positivity in premarital tests, a <b>rapid</b> <b>vaccination</b> program provides early protection, but the 6 th and 12 th month vaccinations are also required.

We vaccinated C 3 H/HeN mice with B. afzelii strain PKo OspC (outer-surface protein C) using a codon-optimized DNA vaccine tattoo and compared this with recombinant protein vaccination in a 0 - 2 - 4 week vaccination schedule. We also assessed protection by DNA tattoo in a 0 - 3 - 6 day schedule. DNA tattoo and recombinant OspC vaccination induced comparable total IgG responses, with a lower IgG 1 /IgG 2 a ratio after DNA tattoo. Two weeks after syringe-challenge with 5 × 10 (5) B. afzelii spirochetes most vaccinated mice had negative B. afzelii tissue DNA loads and all were culture negative. Furthermore, DNA tattoo vaccination in a 0 - 3 - 6 day regimen also resulted in negative Borrelia loads and cultures after challenge. To conclude, DNA vaccination by tattoo was fully protective against B. afzelii challenge in mice in a <b>rapid</b> <b>vaccination</b> protocol, and induces a favorable humoral immunity compared to recombinant protein vaccination.

40|$|BackgroundDuring an {{influenza}} pandemic, {{to achieve}} early and <b>rapid</b> <b>vaccination</b> coverage and maximize {{the benefit of}} an immunization campaign, partnerships between public health agencies and vaccine providers are essential. Immunizing pharmacists represent an important group for expanding access to pandemic vaccination. However, {{little is known about}} nationwide coordination between public health programs and pharmacies for pandemic vaccine response planning. MethodsTo assess relationships and planning activities between public health programs and pharmacies, we analyzed data from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention assessments of jurisdictions that received immunization and emergency preparedness funding from 2012 to 2015. ResultsForty-seven (88. 7 %) of 53 jurisdictions reported including pharmacies in pandemic vaccine distribution plans, 24 (45. 3 %) had processes to recruit pharmacists to vaccinate, and 16 (30. 8 %) of 52 established formal relationships with pharmacies. Most jurisdictions plan to allocate less than 10 % of pandemic vaccine supply to pharmacies.

By deploying large volumes of vaccines at centralized locations, public health authorities can reduce the complexity of emergency vaccine distribution while also enabling <b>rapid,</b> large-scale <b>vaccination.</b> The risk of influenza transmission at MICs must be understood and mitigated to maximize their effectiveness. We have developed a discrete-event simulation of an MIC that can estimate the expected number of infections resulting from disease transmission within the facility. A simulation experiment is conducted that varies MIC crowdedness, staffing levels and the percentage of infectious individuals entering the MIC—symptomatic or not—to assess the impact of these factors on expected infections.

40|$|Oral {{immunization}} {{is attractive}} as a delivery route {{because it is}} needle-free and useful for <b>rapid</b> mass <b>vaccination</b> programs to target pandemics or bioterrorism. This potential {{has not been realized}} for human vaccination, due to the requirement of large antigen doses and toxic (to humans) adjuvants to overcome the induction of oral tolerance and potential degradation of antigens in the stomach. To date, only oral vaccines based on live attenuated organisms have been approved for human use. In this study we describe the use of a lipid-based delivery system/adjuvant, Lipid C, for oral immunization to protect mice against genital tract chlamydial infection. Lipid C is formulated from food-grade purified and fractionated triglycerides. Bacterial shedding following vaginal challenge with Chlamydia muridarum was reduced by 50 % in female mice orally immunized with the chlamydial major outer membrane protein (MOMP) formulated in Lipid C, protection equivalent to that seen in animals immunized with MOMP admixed with both cholera toxin (CT) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG-ODN).

40|$|The {{development}} of vaccines to combat pathogens that infect across mucosal surfaces {{has been a}} major goal of vaccine research. Successful mucosal vaccination requires the co-administration of adjuvants that can overcome the state of immune tolerance normally associated with mucosal application of proteins. In the case of oral immunization, delivery systems are also required to protect vaccine antigens against destruction by gastric pH and digestive enzymes. Furthermore, adjuvants used for mucosal delivery must be free of neurotoxic effects like those induced by the commonly used experimental mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin. Maintenance of the "cold chain" is also essential for the effectiveness of any vaccine and adjuvants/delivery systems that enhance the stability of a vaccine would offer a significant advantage. Needle-free methods of vaccination that induce protective immunity at multiple mucosal surfaces are also desirable for <b>rapid</b> <b>vaccination</b> of large populations. In the present study we show that transcutaneous immunization (TCI) using Lipid C, a novel lipid-based matrix originally developed for oral immunization, containing soluble Helicobacter sonicate significantly reduces the gastric bacterial burden in mice following gastric challenge with live Helicobacter pylori. Protection is associated with the production of splenic gamma interferon and gastric IgA and was achieved without the co-administration of potent and potentially toxic adjuvants, although protection was further enhanced by inclusion of CpG-ODN and cholera toxin in the lipid delivery system...|$|E
40|$|Melioidosis is {{a severe}} {{infectious}} disease {{with a high}} mortality that is endemic in South-East Asia and Northern Australia. The causative pathogen, Burkholderia pseudomallei, is listed as potential bioterror weapon due to its high virulence and potential for easy dissemination. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine for prevention of melioidosis. Here, we explore the use of rapid plasmid DNA vaccination against B. pseudomallei flagellin for protection against respiratory challenge. We tested three flagellin DNA vaccines with different subcellular targeting designs. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were vaccinated via skin tattoo on day 0, 3 and 6 before intranasal challenge with B. pseudomallei on day 21. Next, the most effective construct was used as single vaccination on day 0 by tattoo or intranasal formulation. Mice were sacrificed 72 hours post-challenge to assess bacterial loads, cytokine responses, inflammation and microscopic lesions. A construct encoding a cellular secretion signal resulted in the most effective protection against melioidosis via tattooing, with a 10 -fold reduction in bacterial loads in lungs and distant organs compared to the empty vector. Strikingly, a single intranasal administration of the same vaccine resulted in > 1000 -fold lower bacterial loads and increased survival. Pro-inflammatory cytokine responses were significantly diminished and strong reductions in markers for distant organ damage were observed. A <b>rapid</b> <b>vaccination</b> scheme using flagellin DNA tattoo provides significant protection against intranasal challenge with B. pseudomallei, markedly improved by a single administration via airway mucosa.

40|$|Background: Over 20 000 {{people die}} from rabies {{each year in}} India. At least 95 % of people {{contract}} rabies from an infected dog. Annual vaccination of over 70 % of the dog population has eliminated both canine and human rabies in many countries. Despite having the highest burden of rabies in the world, there have been very few studies which have reported the successful, large scale vaccination of dogs in India. Furthermore, many Indian canine rabies vaccination programmes have not achieved high vaccine coverage. Methods: In this study, we utilised a catch-vaccinate-release approach in a canine rabies vaccination programme in 18 wards in Ranchi, India. Following vaccination, surveys {{of the number of}} marked, vaccinated and unmarked, unvaccinated dogs were undertaken. A bespoke smartphone ‘Mission Rabies ’ application was developed to facilitate data entry and team management. This enabled GPS capture of the location of all vaccinated dogs and dogs sighted on post vaccination surveys. In areas where coverage was below 70 %, catching teams were re-deployed to vaccinate more dogs followed by repeat survey. Results: During the initial vaccination cycle, 6593 dogs were vaccinated. Vaccination coverage was over 70 % in 14 of the 18 wards. A second cycle of vaccination was performed in the 4 wards where initial vaccination coverage was below 70 %. Following this second round of vaccination, coverage was reassessed and found to be over 70 % in two wards and only just below 70 % in the final two wards (66. 7 % and 68. 2 %, respectively). Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that mobile technology enabled efficient team management and rapid data entry and analysis. The vaccination approach outlined in this study has the potential to facilitate the <b>rapid</b> <b>vaccination</b> of large numbers of dogs at a high coverage in free roaming dog populations in India...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Currently {{available}} vaccines for the pandemic Influenza A (H 1 N 1) 2009 {{produced in}} chicken eggs have serious impediments viz limited availability, risk of allergic reactions {{and the possible}} selection of sub-populations differing from the naturally occurring virus, whereas the cell culture derived vaccines are time consuming and may not {{meet the demands of}} <b>rapid</b> global <b>vaccination</b> required to combat the present/future pandemic. Hemagglutinin (HA) based subunit vaccine for H 1 N 1 requires the HA protein in glycosylated form, which is impossible with the commonly used bacterial expression platform. Additionally, bacterial derived protein requires extensive purification and refolding steps for vaccine applications. For these reasons an alternative heterologous system for rapid, easy and economical production of Hemagglutinin protein in its glycosylated form is required. The HA gene of novel H 1 N 1 A/California/ 04 / 2009 was engineered for expression in Pichia pastoris as a soluble secreted protein. The full length HA- synthetic gene having α-secretory tag was integrated into P. pastoris genome through homologous recombination. The resultant Pichia clones having multiple copy integrants of the transgene expressed full length HA protein in the culture supernatant. The Recombinant yeast derived H 1 N 1 HA protein elicited neutralising antibodies both in mice and rabbits. The sera from immunised animals also exhibited Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) activity. Considering the safety, reliability and also economic potential of Pichia expression platform, our preliminary data indicates the feasibility of using this system as an alternative for large-scale production of recombinant influenza HA protein in the face of influenza pandemic threat. </p...|$|R

Further genetic modifications were introduced into the PB 1 gene to enhance the attenuated (att) phenotype of the virus in vivo. Using the att WF 10 as a backbone, we substituted neuraminidase (NA) for hemagglutinin (HA) for vaccine purposes. In chickens, a vaccination scheme consisting of a single dose of an att H 7 N 2 vaccine virus at 2 weeks of age and subsequent challenge with the wild-type H 7 N 2 LPAI virus resulted in complete protection. We further extended our vaccination strategy against the HPAI H 5 N 1. In this case, we reconstituted an att H 5 N 1 vaccine virus, whose HA and NA genes were derived from an Asian H 5 N 1 virus. A single-dose immunization in ovo with the att H 5 N 1 vaccine virus in 18 -day-old chicken embryos resulted in more than 60 % protection for 4 -week-old chickens and 100 % protection for 9 - to 12 -week-old chickens. Boosting at 2 weeks posthatching provided 100 % protection against challenge with the HPAI H 5 N 1 virus for chickens as young as 4 weeks old, with undetectable virus shedding postchallenge.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{research on}} the epidemiology of respiratory diseases in pig herds in GB {{and their impact on}} pig morbidity and mortality. The role of management, characteristics of the herd, presence of multiple pathogens and control and elimination strategies were considered. Questionnaires were completed by veterinarians that attended 116 pig herds in GB. Pathogens were clustered on individual farms, suggesting similar risk factors for infection / persistence. Management factors were investigated for their association with the within and between-herd variability in pig antibodies to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in 103 pig herds. Factors that were important included close proximity to other pig herds, having > 250 sows and not isolating purchased stock or not isolating for long enough. Considering the possible fade out of PRRSV, the within-herd transmission dynamics were investigated using a mathematical model. There was a high frequency of fade out in breeding pigs before virus reached young stock and increased persistence in young stock, in large herds, herds with increased contact between age groups and herds that had frequent re-introduction of virus. Results provided evidence for apparent erratic behaviour of PRRSV within and between herds. Mathematical models were also used to investigate the range of impacts of PRRSV on disease in a herd and to test strategies for control and elimination. PRRSV was difficult to eliminate without targeting both rearing pigs and sows. <b>Rapid</b> <b>vaccination</b> of sows once there was an increase in preweaning still births reduced the spread of virus to rearing pigs. Results highlighted that in areas of GB where the density of pigs is low {{it might be possible to}} control PRRSV through elimination. In larger herds in pig dense regions elimination might be difficult and control might give more stability. The long-term benefits of elimination will depend on (re) -introduction of virus from within and outside the herd but significant improvements in production might not be observed unless several respiratory pathogens are eliminated from a herd. ...|$|E

This is the third revision to these guidelines since they were released in November 2001. This version contains an important addition to our smallpox preparedness efforts-a comprehensive annex titled "Smallpox Vaccination Clinic Guide. " This new section describes the operational and logistical considerations associated with implementing a large-scale voluntary vaccination program in response to a confirmed smallpox outbreak. The clinic guide has been in development for several months with state and other healthcare partners. The "Smallpox Vaccination Clinic Guide" is designed to facilitate and strengthen the ability of state and local officials to quickly and effectively implement large-scale vaccination clinics in response to a smallpox outbreak. Following a confirmed smallpox outbreak, <b>rapid</b> voluntary <b>vaccination</b> of a large population may be required to: 1) supplement priority surveillance and containment control strategies in areas with smallpox cases, 2) reduce the "at-risk" population for additional intentional releases of smallpox virus if the probability of such occurrences is considered significant, or 3) address heightened public or political concerns regarding access to voluntary vaccination. The clinic guide was posted to w ww. cdc. gov earlier today. The CDC will be holding a media teleconference today at 12 noon (Eastern time) to discuss the latest version of the Smallpox Response Plan and Guidelines, including the clinic guide.

We describe an influenza A outbreak {{on a military}} base where 3, 000 young adults, {{most of whom were}} unvaccinated, lived in close daily contact. Visits to the base clinic by 48 persons with acute respiratory illness within 2 days allowed early identification of this outbreak and prompted immediate epidemiologic investigation. Overall, 85 personnel (2. 83 % of base population) met the case definition for influenzalike illness. Onsite laboratory confirmation with field detection kits, rapid implementation of respiratory illness control protocols, and a mass vaccination campaign were applied to limit disease dissemination.

We review the control measures available for controlling influenza outbreaks in confined settings and discuss the role of <b>rapid</b> mass <b>vaccination</b> within this context. Influenza causes substantial illness and loss of work days among young adults, and outbreaks can affect the preparedness of military units (1).

40|$|Background: In {{the face}} of {{impending}} influenza pandemic, a rapid vaccine production and mass vaccination {{is the most effective}} approach to prevent the large scale mortality and morbidity that was associated with the 1918 "Spanish Flu". The traditional process of influenza vaccine production in eggs is time consuming and may not meet the demands of <b>rapid</b> global <b>vaccination</b> required to curtail influenza pandemic. Methodology/Principal Findings: Recombinant technology can be used to express the hemagglutinin (HA) of the emerging new influenza strain in a variety of systems including mammalian, insect, and bacterial cells. In this study, two forms of HA proteins derived from the currently circulating novel H 1 N 1 A/California/ 07 / 2009 virus, HA 1 (1 - 330) and HA (1 - 480), were expressed and purified from E. coli under controlled redox refolding conditions that favoured proper protein folding. However, only the recombinant HA 1 (1 - 330) protein formed oligomers, including functional trimers that bound receptor and caused agglutination of human red blood cells. These proteins were used to vaccinate ferrets prior to challenge with the A/California/ 07 / 2009 virus. Both proteins induced neutralizing antibodies, and reduced viral loads in nasal washes. However, the HA 1 (1 - 330) protein that had higher content of multimeric forms provided better protection from fever and weight loss at a lower vaccine dose compared with HA (1 - 480). Protein yield for the HA 1 (1 - 330) ranged around 40 mg/Liter, while the HA (1 - 480) yield was 0. 4 - 0. 8 mg/Liter. Conclusions/Significance: This is the first study that describes production in bacterial system of properly folded functional globular HA 1 domain trimers, lacking the HA 2 transmembrane protein, that elicit potent neutralizing antibody responses following vaccination and protect ferrets from in vivo challenge. The combination of bacterial expression system with established quality control methods could provide a mechanism for rapid large scale production of influenza vaccines in {{the face of}} influenza pandemic threat...|$|R

The potential use of attenuated bacteria as engineered vectors for vaccine development offers several advantages, including the stimulation of innate immunity. We developed an attenuated live bacterial vector using the type III secretion system (TTSS) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to deliver in vivo tumor antigens. Using an inducible and <b>rapid</b> expression plasmid, <b>vaccination</b> with several antigens of different length and epitope composition, including TRp- 2, gp 100 and MUC 18, was evaluated against glioma tumor cells.

40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{demonstrated}} that T-helper cell-dependent events during the initial priming period are required for the generation of CD 8 + T cell-mediated protective immunity. The underlying mechanisms of this phenomenon have not yet been determined, mostly because of difficulties in studying memory T cells or their precursor populations at early stages during immune responses. We identified IL- 7 receptor (CD 127) surface expression as a marker for long-living memory T cells, most importantly allowing the distinction between memory and effector T cells early after in vivo priming. The combination of surface staining for CD 127 and CD 62 L further separates between two functionally distinct memory cell subsets, which are similar (if not identical) to cell subsets recently described as central memory T cells (CD 127 high and CD 62 Lhigh) and peripheral effector memory T cells (CD 127 high and CD 62 Llow). Using this new tool of memory T cell analysis, we demonstrate that CD 8 + T cell priming in the absence of T cell help or CD 40 L specifically alters the generation of the effector memory T cell subset, which appears to be crucial for immediate memory responses and long-term maintenance of effective protective immunity. Our data reveal a unique strategy to obtain information about the quality of long-term protective immunity early during an immune response, a finding that may be applied in a variety of clinical settings, including the <b>rapid</b> monitoring of <b>vaccination</b> success...|$|R

In this paper, we outline major events with regards to the HPV vaccine controversy in Japan since May 2014, highlighting long-term implications of the <b>rapid</b> drop in <b>vaccination</b> coverage and recommending how to best move forward. There are also two addendums that explore global perspectives on the current situation in Japan and examine examples of how other countries have dealt with concerns and opposition to the HPV vaccine...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 395 Haemophilus influenzae strains from 226 Japanese {{institutions}} {{participating in the}} Nationwide Surveillance Study Group for Bacterial Meningitis were received from 1999 to 2002. All strains were analyzed by PCR to identify the resistance genes, and their susceptibilities to β-lactam agents were determined. Of these strains, 29. 1 % were β-lactamase nonproducing and ampicillin (AMP) susceptible (BLNAS) and lacked all resistance genes; 15. 4 % were β-lactamase producing and AMP resistant and had the blaTEM- 1 gene; 30. 6 % were β-lactamase nonproducing and AMP resistant (low-BLNAR) and had a Lys- 526 or His- 517 amino acid substitution in ftsI encoding PBP 3; 13. 9 % were β-lactamase nonproducing and AMP resistant (BLNAR) and had an additional substitution of Thr- 385 in ftsI; 9. 1 % were amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistant (BLPACR I) and had the blaTEM- 1 gene and a Lys- 526 or His- 517 amino acid substitution in ftsI; and 1. 8 % showed resistance {{similar to that of}} the BLPACR I group (BLPACR II) but had blaTEM- 1 gene and ftsI substitutions, as was the case for the BLNAR strains. All but three strains were serotype b. The prevalence of BLNAR strains has increased rapidly: 0 % in 1999, 5. 8 % in 2000, 14. 1 % in 2001, and 21. 3 % in 2002. The MICs at which 90 % of BLNAR isolates were inhibited were as follows: AMP, 16 μg/ml; cefotaxime, 1 μg/ml; ceftriaxone, 0. 25 μg/ml; and meropenem, 0. 5 μg/ml. All of these values were higher than those for the BLNAS counterpart strains. The relatively wide distributions of the β-lactam MICs for BLNAR strains presumably reflect variations in ftsI gene mutations. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis suggested the rapid spread of specific H. influenzae type b strains throughout Japan. Expedited <b>vaccination,</b> <b>rapid</b> identification, and judicious antibiotic use could slow their spread...|$|R
40|$|There is no {{licensed}} human vaccine {{currently available}} for Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV), a Category A high priority pathogen {{and a serious}} zoonotic threat. While neutralizing antibodies targeting the viral glycoproteins are protective, they appear late {{in the course of}} infection, and may not be induced in time to prevent a natural or bioterrorism-induced outbreak. Here we examined the immunogenicity of RVFV nucleocapsid (N) protein as a CD 8 (+) T cell antigen with the potential for inducing <b>rapid</b> protection after <b>vaccination.</b> HLA-A* 0201 (A 2) -restricted epitopic determinants were identified with N-specific CD 8 (+) T cells from eight healthy donors that were primed with dendritic cells transduced to express N, and subsequently expanded in vitro by weekly re-stimulations with monocytes pulsed with 59 15 mer overlapping peptides (OLPs) across N. Two immunodominant epitopes, VT 9 (VLSEWLPVT, N(121 - 129)) and IL 9 (ILDAHSLYL, N 165 - 173), were defined. VT 9 - and IL 9 -specific CD 8 (+) T cells identified by tetramer staining were cytotoxic and polyfunctional, characteristics deemed important for viral control in vivo. These peptides induced specific CD 8 (+) T cell responses in A 2 -transgenic mice, and more importantly, potent N-specific CD 8 (+) T cell reactivities, including VT 9 - and IL 9 -specific ones, were mounted by mice after a booster vaccination with the live attenuated RVF MP- 12. Our data suggest that the RVFV N protein is a potent human T cell immunogen capable of eliciting broad, immunodominant CD 8 (+) T cell responses that are potentially protective. Understanding the immune responses to the nucleocapsid is central to the design of an effective RVFV vaccine irrespective of whether this viral protein is effective as a stand-alone immunogen or only in combination with other RVFV antigens...|$|R
40|$|The {{cessation}} of the adenovirus vaccination program for military trainees {{has resulted in}} several recent acute respiratory disease (ARD) outbreaks. In the absence of <b>vaccination,</b> <b>rapid</b> detection methods are necessary for the timely implementation of measures to prevent adenovirus transmission within military training facilities. To this end, we have combined a fluorogenic real-time multiplex PCR assay with four sets of degenerate PCR primers that target the E 1 A, fiber, and hexon genes with a long oligonucleotide microarray capable of identifying the most common adenovirus serotypes associated with adult respiratory tract infections (serotypes 3, 4, 7, 16, and 21) and a representative member of adenovirus subgroup C (serotype 6) that is a common cause of childhood ARD and that often persists into adulthood. Analyses with prototype strains demonstrated unique hybridization patterns for representative members of adenovirus subgroups B 1, B 2, C, and E, thus allowing serotype determination. Microarray-based sensitivity assessments revealed lower detection limits (between 1 and 100 genomic copies) for adenovirus serotype 4 (Ad 4) and Ad 7 cell culture lysates, clinical nasal washes, and throat swabs and purified DNA from clinical samples. When adenovirus was detected from coded clinical samples, the results obtained by this approach demonstrated an excellent concordance with those obtained by the more established method of adenovirus identification {{as well as by}} cell culture with fluorescent-antibody staining. Finally, the utility of this method was further supported by its ability to detect adenoviral coinfections, contamination, and, potentially, recombination events. Taken together, the results demonstrate the usefulness of the simple and rapid diagnostic method developed for the unequivocal identification of ARD-associated adenoviral serotypes from laboratory or clinical samples that can be completed in 1. 5 to 4. 0 h...|$|R
40|$|Several {{countries}} {{within the}} EU have successfully eradicated bovine herpesvirus type I (BHV 1), {{while others are}} still making efforts to eradicate the virus. Reintroduction of the virus into BHV 1 -free areas can lead to major outbreaks — thereby causing severe economic losses. To give decision-makers more insight into the risk and economic consequences of BHV 1 reintroduction and into the effectiveness of various control strategies, we developed the simulation model InterIBR. InterIBR is a dynamic model {{that takes into account}} risk and uncertainty and the geographic location of individual farms. Simulation of a BHV 1 -outbreak in the Netherlands starts with introduction of the virus on a predefined farm type, after which both within-farm and between-farm transmission are simulated. Monitoring and control measures are implemented to simulate detection of the infection and subsequent control. Economic consequences included in this study are related to losses due to infection and costs of control. In the simulated basic control strategy, dairy farms are monitored by monthly bulk-milk tests and miscellaneous farms are monitored by half-yearly serological tests. After detection, movement-control measures apply, animal contacts are traced and neighbour farms are put on surveillance. Given current assumptions on transmission dynamics, we conclude that a strategy with either <b>rapid</b> removal or <b>vaccination</b> of infected cattle does not reduce the number of infected farms compared to this basic strategy — but will cost more to control. Farm type with first introduction of BHV 1 has a considerable impact on the expected number of secondarily infected farms and total costs. To limit the number of infected farms and total costs due to outbreaks, we suggest intensifying the monitoring program on farms with a high frequency of cattle trade, and monthly bulk-milk testing on dairy farm...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Recently, two point-of-care (PoC) feline {{immunodeficiency}} virus (FIV) antibody test kits (Witness and Anigen Rapid) {{were reported as}} being able to differentiate FIV-vaccinated from FIV-infected cats at a single time point, irrespective of the gap between testing and last vaccination (0 – 7 years). The aim {{of the current study}} was to investigate systematically anti-FIV antibody production over time in response to the recommended primary FIV vaccination series. Methods: First, residual plasma from the original study was tested using a laboratory-based ELISA to determine whether negative results with PoC testing were due to reduced as opposed to absent antibodies to gp 40. Second, a prospective study was performed using immunologically naive client-owned kittens and cats given a primary FIV vaccination series using a commercially available inactivated whole cell/inactivated whole virus vaccine (Fel-O-Vax FIV, three subcutaneous injections at 4 week intervals) and tested systematically (up to 11 times) over 6 months, using four commercially available PoC FIV antibody kits (SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo [detects antibodies to p 15 /p 24], Witness FeLV/FIV [gp 40], Anigen Rapid FIV/FeLV [p 24 /gp 40] and VetScan FeLV/FIV Rapid [p 24]). Results: The laboratory-based ELISA showed cats from the original study vaccinated within the previous 0 – 15 months had detectable levels of antibodies to gp 40, despite testing negative with two kits that use gp 40 as a capture antigen (Witness and Anigen Rapid kits). The prospective study showed that antibody testing with SNAP Combo and VetScan Rapid was positive in all cats 2 weeks after the second primary FIV vaccination, and remained positive {{for the duration of the}} study (12 / 12 and 10 / 12 cats positive, respectively). Antibody testing with Witness and Anigen Rapid was also positive in a high proportion of cats 2 weeks after the second primary FIV vaccination (8 / 12 and 7 / 12, respectively), but antibody levels declined below the level of detection in most cats (10 / 12) by 1 month after the third (final) primary FIV vaccination. All cats tested negative using Witness and Anigen Rapid 6 months after the third primary FIV vaccination. Conclusions and relevance: This study has shown that a primary course of FIV vaccination does not interfere with FIV antibody testing in cats using Witness and Anigen <b>Rapid,</b> provided primary <b>vaccination</b> has not occurred within the previous 6 months. Consequently, Witness and Anigen Rapid antibody test kits can be used reliably to determine FIV infection status at the time of annual booster FIV vaccination to help detect ‘vaccine breakthroughs’ and in cats that have not received a primary course of FIV vaccination within the preceding 6 months. The duration of antibody response following annual booster FIV vaccination and the resulting effect on antibody testing using PoC kits needs to be determined by further research. The mechanism(s) for the variation in FIV antibody test kit performance remains unclear...|$|R
