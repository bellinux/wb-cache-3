5|$|Stocks surged {{worldwide}} {{after the}} EU announced the EFSF's creation.

5|$|In the 1970s, {{the price}} of raccoon pelts <b>rose</b> <b>again</b> {{to a high of}} 25 to 30 dollars each, and some people made their entire income from coon hunting. It was {{possible}} to catch ten raccoons per night in well-populated areas, with good dogs. One outdoors writer estimated that in 1985 there were 30 to 40 thousand coon hunters in Michigan alone. This market hunting largely died out by the late 1980s, and it is estimated that during the fur boom trapping took more raccoons than hunting with dogs.|$|E

Ten priests of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland and 90 moderate socialists were also killed. The level of executions varied over the war months; the numbers peaked in February during the period of securing the power. March saw low counts because the Reds could never seize new areas outside Red Finland. The numbers <b>rose</b> <b>again</b> in April as the Reds aimed to leave Finland. The two major terror centres were Toijala and Kouvola; 300–350 Whites were executed between February and April 1918.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{early in}} 1893, {{a number of}} {{industrial}} firms, including the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and the National Cordage Company went bankrupt. The resulting bank runs and failures {{became known as the}} Panic of 1893. In June of that year, President Grover Cleveland, who believed that the Panic was caused by the inflation generated by the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, called a special session of Congress in order to repeal it. The act was repealed on November 1, 1893. On June 13, 1898, Congress ordered the coining of all the remaining bullion purchased under the Sherman Silver Purchase Act into silver dollars. Silver dollar production <b>rose</b> <b>again,</b> until the bullion was exhausted in 1904, when it ceased.|$|E
5|$|Fears of an Ottoman attack <b>rose</b> <b>again</b> {{after the}} fall of Candia in 1669, and the {{following}} year Grand Master Nicolas Cotoner invited the military engineer Antonio Maurizio Valperga to improve the fortifications. At the time the Floriana Lines were still under construction, and a number of weak points had been identified in their original design, especially since the demi-bastions forming the two extremities of the land front were too acute and could not be well defended. Valperga attempted to correct these flaws by making a number of alterations to San Salvatore Bastion on the western end of the lines, and constructing a faussebraye around the entire land front and a crowned hornwork near the eastern end. In the 1680s some minor modifications were made by the Flemish engineer Carlos de Grunenbergh.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days, Chinese Foochow {{settlers}} in Sibu tried {{to convert the}} town into a rice cultivation centre. However, this vision did not materialise because the soil was not suitable for rice cultivation. In August 1909, Charles Brooke agreed to grant land titles to Sibu Chinese farmers and encouraged them to cultivate rubber plantations. The rise of rubber prices from 1909 to 1911 had encouraged another 2,000 Foochow settles to come to Sibu. The demand for rubber <b>rose</b> <b>again</b> during Korean War between 1950 and 1953 and has benefited Sibu rubber plantations. Local farmers later used the profits from rubber plantations into setting up shops at Sungai Merah and Durin bazaars and involve in more profitable timber industry. During the Sarawak Communist Insurgency in the 1970s, rural farmers had to abandon their rubber plantations because of martial law declared by the state government which forbade them for helping the communists operating in the jungles.|$|E
5|$|Jerome made news in 1917, when strikes {{involving}} the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) {{led to the}} expulsion at gunpoint of about 60 IWW members, who were loaded on a cattle car and shipped west. Production at the mines, always subject to fluctuations, boomed during World War I, fell thereafter, <b>rose</b> <b>again,</b> then fell again {{during and after the}} Great Depression. As the ore deposits ran out, the mines closed, and the population dwindled to fewer than 100 by the mid-1950s. Efforts to save the town from oblivion succeeded when residents turned to tourism and retail sales. Jerome became a National Historic Landmark in 1967. By the early 21stcentury, Jerome had art galleries, coffee houses, restaurants, a state park, and a local museum devoted to mining history.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{years after}} their defeat, with Roman {{dominance}} of the area looking assured, the Samnites <b>rose</b> <b>again</b> and defeated the Romans at the Battle of Camerinum in 298 BC, to open the Third Samnite War. With this success in hand they managed to bring together a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome, {{all of whom were}} probably keen to prevent any one faction dominating the entire region. The army that faced the Romans at the Battle of Sentinum in 295 BC included Samnites, Gauls, Etruscans and Umbrians. When the Roman army won a convincing victory over these combined forces it must have become clear that little could prevent Roman dominance of Italy and in the Battle of Populonia (282 BC) Rome destroyed the last vestiges of Etruscan power in the region.|$|E

These two tribes <b>rose</b> up <b>again</b> a century later, in 921. Again they were quickly subdued, this time by the strategos Krenites Arotras, but managed to remain autonomous and retain their distinct identity until well into Frankish times.|$|R

5|$|The Wild Flower and the Rose is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film focuses on Frank Wilson, {{the son of an}} inventor who has constructed a new airplane model. After failing to secure financing, his father suggests that he marry Rose, the daughter of his wealthy employer, to get the money they need. Jack rejects this idea because he is engaged to another woman, but he soon learns she does not love him. He heads out West to seek a fortune and is quickly successful. He returns to the aviation field and meets <b>Rose</b> <b>again,</b> after a successful flight she confesses to loving him. The cast and staff credits are unknown, but the film may have included scenes from the 1910 International Aviation Meet at Belmont Park. One reviewer claimed that a Wright brothers flyer was also shown in full flight. The film was released on November 25, 1910, but is now presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|Bernardo Grinspun, {{the first}} {{minister}} of the economy, arranged an increase in wages, reaching the levels of 1975. This caused inflation to reach 32%. He also tried to negotiate more favourable terms on the country's foreign debt, but the negotiations failed. Risking a default, he negotiated with the IMF, which requested spending cuts. International credits prevented default {{at the end of}} 1984, but he resigned in March 1985 when the debt reached $1billion and the IMF denied further credits. Grinspun was succeeded by Juan Vital Sourrouille, who designed the Austral plan. This plan froze prices and wages, stopped the printing of money, arranged spending cuts, and established a new currency, the Austral. The plan was a success in the short term, and choked inflation. Inflation <b>rose</b> <b>again</b> {{by the end of the}} year, the CGT opposed the wage freeze, and business community opposed the price freeze. Alfonsín thought that the privatization of some state assets and a deregulation of the economy might work, but those proposals were opposed by both the PJ and his own party.|$|E
5|$|The euro is the second-most {{widely held}} reserve {{currency}} after the U.S. dollar. After its introduction on 4 January 1999 its exchange rate {{against the other}} major currencies fell reaching its lowest exchange rates in 2000 (25 October vs the U.S. dollar, 26 October vs Japanese Yen, 3 May vs Pound Sterling). Afterwards it regained and its exchange rate reached its historical highest point in 2008 (15 July vs U.S. dollar, 23 July vs Japanese Yen, 29 December vs Pound Sterling). With {{the advent of the}} global financial crisis the euro initially fell, only to regain later. Despite pressure due to the European sovereign-debt crisis the euro remained stable. In November 2011 the euro's exchange rate index– measured against currencies of the bloc's major trading partners– was trading almost two percent higher on the year, approximately at the same level as it was before the crisis kicked off in 2007. In late August 2017 € <b>rose</b> <b>again</b> above 1.20 $.It also hit new relative or absolute highs against £ and other currencies.|$|E

5|$|While {{claiming}} royal {{status as}} Cazique, MacGregor attempted to dissociate {{himself from the}} Latin American republican movement and his former comrades there, and from late 1822 made discreet overtures towards the Spanish government regarding co-operation in Central America. The Spanish paid him little notice. The Poyaisian bonds' price remained fairly steady until they were crippled by developments elsewhere in the market during November and December 1822. Amid the general instability in South America, the Colombian government suggested that its London agent might have exceeded his authority when he arranged the £2million loan. When this representative suddenly died, the frantic buying of South American securities was abruptly replaced by equally restless selling. The Cazique's cash flow was all but wiped out when {{most of those who}} had bought the Poyaisian scrip did not make the payments due in January. While the price of the Colombian bonds steadied and eventually <b>rose</b> <b>again,</b> the Poyaisian securities never recovered; by late 1823 they were traded for less than 10% of their face value.|$|E

Smooth continued to increase its audience share in the second quarter of 2011, with an average weekly total of 3.2 million, which rose once again in the third quarter to 3.328 million, meaning that for the first time Smooth's figures overtook those of one of its national rivals, talkSPORT. The station had an audience of 3.3 million in {{the final quarter}} of 2011, making it the second most listened to national commercial radio station in the UK. 3,317,000 listeners were tuning in during the first quarter of 2012, which dropped slightly in the second quarter to 3.2 million. The third quarter of 2012 saw another small drop to 3.19 million, but in the same period Smooth 70s recorded its first audience figures of 749,000. Collectively 3.7 million listeners were tuning into Smooth-branded stations. That figure rose to 3.8 million in the final quarter of the year. The first quarter of 2013 saw an average weekly audience of 3.6 million, which fell to 3.1 million for the second quarter.

5|$|In {{the first}} half of 1649, the {{negotiations}} with the Cossacks fell through, and the Polish-Lithuanian military begun gathering near the borders with the rebellious Ukraine, a major camp was in Zbarazh, where Wiśniowiecki would arrive as well in late June, after gathering a new army of 3,000 in Wiśnicz, which was all he was able to afford at that time, as due to most of his estates being overrun by the Cossacks. Wiśniowiecki's arrival raised the morale of the royal army, and despite having no official rank, both the common soldiers and the new regimentarz promised to take his advice, and even offered him the official command (which he refused). During the Siege of Zbarazh Wiśniowiecki was thus not the official commander (role was taken by regimentarz Andrzej Firlej) but most historians agree he was the real, if unofficial, commander of the Polish-Lithuanian army. The siege would last until the ceasefire of the Treaty of Zboriv. Wiśniowiecki's command during the siege was seen as phenomenal, and his popularity among the troops and nobility <b>rose</b> <b>again,</b> however the King, still not fond of him, gave him a relatively small reward (the land grant of starostwo przasnyskie, much less when compared to several others he distributed around that time). Needing Wiśniowiecki's support in December that year, the King granted him once again a temporary hetman nomination, and several more land grants. In April 1650, Wiśniowiecki had to return his temporary hetman office to Mikołaj Potocki, recently released from Cossack's captivity. During December that year, in light of the growing tensions with Muscovy, Wiśniowiecki's military faction succeeded in convincing the Sejm to pass a resolution increasing the size of the army to 51,000, the largest army since the Cossack unrest begun two years ago.|$|E
