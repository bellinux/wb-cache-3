The move prevents the public from accessing the official record about the raid, and bypasses several important federal records keeping procedures in the process.|$|E
5|$|Neelambari plans her {{revenge on}} Padayappa, now {{a father of}} two daughters. Suryaprakash also has a son, Chandraprakash alias Chandru, who studies at the same college as Padayappa's elder daughter, Anitha. Neelambari advises Chandru to make Anitha {{fall in love with}} him. At the same time, Padayappa plans to get Anitha married to his sister's son. Neelambari, having made Chandru pretend {{to fall in love with}} Anitha, plans to humiliate Padayappa by making Anitha say that she does not wish to marry a groom of her parents' choice and that she is in love with someone else. At the {{marriage}} ceremony, after Anitha does what Neelambari told her to do, Padayappa makes an oath to unite Anitha with her lover by the next Muhurta day, or commit suicide. Padayappa discovers that Chandru <b>really</b> <b>did</b> fall in love with Anitha even though he was only initially pretending to do so on Neelambari's advise. When Padayappa takes Chandru and Anitha to the temple to get married, Neelambari and Suryaprakash give chase to stop them. Suryaprakash is killed in a car accident during the chase.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, 5 September, the Australians {{arrived at}} Clifton for what {{promised to be}} an {{explosive}} encounter. Midwinter did not play for Gloucestershire due to his hand injury but his absence probably counted for little as the Australians took due revenge on the Graces and beat Gloucestershire soundly by 10 wickets inside two days. Spofforth had 12 wickets in the match, taking 7–49 and 5–41 as Gloucestershire struggled to 112 and 85, Grace making 22 and 5. As it happened, Spofforth did not get his wicket, though he caught Grace off Boyle in the first innings. In the second, Grace was lbw to Garrett. Grace could take only 1–90 in the Australian first innings of 183, in which Spofforth, who <b>really</b> <b>did</b> have a score to settle, top-scored with 44. To completely make his point, Spofforth then opened the Australian second innings in which he and Bailey scored the necessary 17 without loss. It {{was the first time}} Gloucestershire, formed in 1870, had been beaten in a home match.|$|E

5|$|The other {{text that}} seems to support the case for Arthur's {{historical}} existence is the 10th-century Annales Cambriae, which also link Arthur with the Battle of Badon. The Annales date this battle to 516–518, and also mention the Battle of Camlann, in which Arthur and Medraut (Mordred) were both killed, dated to 537–539. These details have often been used to bolster confidence in the Historias account and to confirm that Arthur <b>really</b> <b>did</b> fight at Badon. Problems have been identified, however, with using this source to support the Historia Brittonums account. The latest {{research shows that the}} Annales Cambriae was based on a chronicle begun in the late 8th century in Wales. Additionally, the complex textual history of the Annales Cambriae precludes any certainty that the Arthurian annals were added to it even that early. They were more likely added {{at some point in the}} 10th century and may never have existed in any earlier set of annals. The Badon entry probably derived from the Historia Brittonum.|$|E

25|$|Russian novelist Alexey Novikov-Priboy <b>really</b> <b>did</b> {{serve in}} the Baltic Fleet and wrote about the {{conflict}} on his return, but his early work was suppressed.

The first part was published in 1932, the second in 1935, and the whole novel was later awarded the Stalin Prize. It describes the heroism of Russian sailors and certain officers whose defeat, in accordance with the new Soviet thinking, was due to the criminal negligence of the Imperial Naval command. A German novel by Frank Thiess, originally published as Tsushima in 1936 (and later translated as The Voyage of Forgotten Men), covered the same journey round the world to defeat.|$|E

25|$|The {{mark of a}} great cabinetmaker is his {{combination}} of design and execution. It's how well they resolve the challenges of designing a piece coupled with their craftsmanship and technique. Pabst was the most distinguished cabinetmaker in Philadelphia {{in the last quarter}} of the 19th century. Clearly, the quality of his carving and cabinetmaking is of the highest order, and Philadelphia has a tradition of producing superior furniture since the 18th century, overshadowing Boston and New York.Daniel Pabst <b>really</b> <b>did</b> develop a unique and identifiable decorative vocabulary. He tended to envelop the object's architecture with a fine scale pattern; it was an invention of his own. He wasn't aping the European antecedent. While I think there are masterpieces of Pabst's not from Furness's pen, he certainly benefitted from his close association with the architect.Pabst's Modern Gothic work presents the very germ of the modern movement. Like Christopher Dresser and Bruce Talbert, he conventionalized design, departing from the realistic motifs of the mid-19th century. You can see where this reductivity evolves into the Craftsman style.— Andrew Van Styn, furniture scholar & dealer.|$|E
25|$|Weyl also {{discusses}} {{claims of}} Fokker's outright plagiarism or taking sole {{credit for the}} work of his staff, first designer Martin Kreuzer and later Reinhold Platz. For example, contemporary German documents for the E.V/D.VIII refer to Fokker as 'the designer' but Weyl and other authors now suggest that Platz was the real design genius behind the Dr.I, D.VII and D.VIII. There may be some truth in this as Platz recalled to Weyl that he attended high level meetings alongside Fokker but was never introduced or referred-to as the designer and often never even spoke. Yet when Fokker fled Germany it was Platz who immediately took over the German works on Fokker's behalf. Fokker later moved Platz to the Netherlands, as head designer, when the post-war German operation collapsed which indicates Platz <b>really</b> <b>did</b> play a greater design role than Fokker admits. Weyl uncharitably suggests that Platz's role at the Fokker D.VIII crisis meetings was to take the blame if anything was wrong and not receive credit. How much of this interpretation is {{based on the fact that}} Platz was still alive to tell his side of the story in 1965, and Fokker was not, is unclear.|$|E
25|$|While the Loch Ness monster {{is often}} {{reported}} as {{looking like a}} plesiosaur, it is also often described as looking completely different. A number of reasons have been presented for why a plesiosaurian identity is unlikely. These include {{the assumption that the}} water in the loch is too cold for a, for the sake of this argument, presumed cold-blooded reptile to be able to survive easily, the assumption that air-breathing animals would be easy to see whenever they appear at the surface to breathe, the fact that the loch is too small and contains insufficient food to be able to support a breeding colony of large animals, and finally the fact that the lake was only formed 10,000 years ago {{at the end of the}} last ice age, while the latest fossil appearance of plesiosaurs dates to over 66 million years ago. Frequent explanations for the sightings include waves, floating inanimate objects, tricks of the light, swimming known animals, and practical jokes. Nevertheless, in the popular imagination, plesiosaurs have come to be identified with the Monster of Loch Ness. This has had the advantage of making the group better known to the general public, but the disadvantage that people have trouble taking the subject seriously, forcing paleontologists to explain time and again that plesiosaurs <b>really</b> <b>did</b> exist and are not creatures of myth or fantasy.|$|E
