5|$|Data {{from the}} ZDR was {{passed to the}} All-Target Processor (ATP), which ran initial {{processing}} on as many as 625 objects in a cloud. As many as 50 of these could be picked out for further processing in the Discrimination and Control Computer (DCC), which ran more tests on those tracks and assigned each one a probability of being the warhead or decoy. The DCC was able to run 100 different tests. For exoatmospheric signals the tests included measure of <b>radar</b> <b>return</b> pulse-to-pulse to look for tumbling objects, as well as variations in signals strength due to changes in frequency. Within the atmosphere, the primary method was examining the velocities of the objects to determine their mass.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 was {{designed}} to be highly difficult to detect and track by radar. Measures to reduce radar cross-section include airframe shaping such as alignment of edges, fixed-geometry serpentine inlets that prevent line-of-sight of the engine faces from any exterior view, use of radar-absorbent material (RAM), and attention to detail such as hinges and pilot helmets that could provide a <b>radar</b> <b>return.</b> The F-22 was also designed to have decreased radio emissions, infrared signature and acoustic signature as well as reduced visibility to the naked eye. The aircraft's flat thrust-vectoring nozzle reduces infrared emissions to mitigate the threat of infrared homing ("heat seeking") surface-to-air or air-to-air missiles. Additional measures to reduce the infrared signature include special paint and active cooling of leading edges to manage the heat buildup from supersonic flight.|$|E

25|$|The Su-57 will be {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft in Russian Air Force service to use stealth technology. Similar to other stealth fighters such as the F-22, the airframe incorporates planform edge alignment to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS); the leading and trailing edges of the wings and control surfaces and the serrated edges of skin panels are carefully aligned at several specific angles {{in order to reduce the}} number of directions the radar waves can be reflected. Weapons are carried internally in weapons bays within the airframe, and antennas are recessed from the surface of the skin to preserve the aircraft's stealthy shape. The IRST housing is turned backwards when not in use, and its rear is treated with radar-absorbent material (RAM) to reduce its <b>radar</b> <b>return.</b> To mask the significant RCS contribution of the engine face, the partial serpentine inlet obscures most, but not all, of the engine's fan and inlet guide-vanes (IGV). The production aircraft incorporates radar blockers similar in principle to those used on the F/A-18E/F in front of the engine fan to hide it from all angles. The aircraft uses RAM to absorb radar emissions and reduce their reflection back to the source, and the canopy is treated with a coating to minimize the <b>radar</b> <b>return</b> of the cockpit and pilot.|$|E
25|$|As the {{aircraft}} approached the MAC VOR from the north, the pilot turned right, {{heading out to}} sea, 1.0 to 1.5nm before reaching the MAC VOR. This {{made it difficult to}} establish {{the aircraft}} on the proper outbound course, though this was eventually done. The aircraft began its descent on this outbound leg, but it failed to level off at the minimum altitude of 1,540 feet. At 2416:22, the last radar contact was recorded with the aircraft 200 feet below that altitude, still outbound, and still descending at 1,050 feet per minute. At 2418 (approximately 100 seconds after the last <b>radar</b> <b>return)</b> the pilot made his last call to the controller (who did not have radar), saying he had completed his base turn back to the airport. Investigators believe the aircraft hit the water very soon after that transmission.|$|E

40|$|Laser-induced {{fluorescence}} (LIF) is {{a promising}} technique for laser radar applications. Laser radar using LIF {{has already been}} applied to algae blooms and oil slicks. Laser radar using LIF has great potential for remote chemical analysis because LIF spectra are extremely sensitive to chemical composition. However, most samples {{in the real world}} contain mixtures of fluorescing components, not merely individual components. Multicomponent analysis of laser <b>radar</b> <b>returns</b> from mixtures is often difficult because LIF spectra from solids and liquids are very broad and devoid of line structure. Therefore, algorithms for interpreting LIF spectra from laser <b>radar</b> <b>returns</b> must be able to analyze spectra that overlap in multicomponent systems. This paper analyzes the possibility of using factor analysis-rank annihilation (FARA) to analyze emission-time matrices (ETM) from laser <b>radar</b> <b>returns</b> instead of excitation-emission matrices (EEM). The authors here define ETM as matrices where the rows (or columns) are emission spectra at fixed times and the columns (or rows) are temporal profiles for fixed emission wavelengths. Laser radar usually uses pulsed lasers for ranging purposes, which are suitable for measuring temporal profiles. Laser radar targets are hard instead of diffuse; that is, a definite surface emits the fluorescence instead of an extended volume. A hard target would not broaden the temporal profiles as would a diffuse target. Both fluorescence lifetimes and emission spectra are sensitive to chemical composition. Therefore, temporal profiles can be used instead of excitation spectra in FARA analysis of laser <b>radar</b> <b>returns.</b> The resulting laser <b>radar</b> <b>returns</b> would be ETM instead of EEM...|$|R
2500|$|As ABMs {{were being}} developed, {{countermeasures}} were also being studied. As the systems generally used long-range radars {{to find and}} track the incoming warheads, the simplest solution was to add radar reflectors and other decoys to the launch. These took up little room or weight, but would make a <b>radar</b> <b>return</b> that looked like an additional warhead. This would force the defender to use more ABMs to ensure the [...] "right" [...] object was hit, or wait until they started to re-enter, when the lighter objects would slow down faster and leave the warhead racing ahead. Neither option was particularly attractive in cost terms, generally requiring more and faster missiles.|$|E
2500|$|The DEW Line was {{the northernmost}} and most capable of three radar lines in Canada and Alaska. The {{first of these}} was the joint Canadian-US Pinetree Line, which ran from Newfoundland to Vancouver Island {{just north of the}} Canadian border, but even while it was being built there were {{concerns}} that it would not provide enough warning time to launch an effective counterattack. The Mid-Canada Line (MCL) was proposed as an inexpensive solution using a new type of radar. This provided a [...] "trip wire" [...] warning located roughly at the 55th parallel, giving commanders ample warning time, but little information on the targets or their exact location or types of targets. The MCL proved largely useless in practice, as the <b>radar</b> <b>return</b> of flocks of birds overwhelmed signals from aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|The Zumwalt-class {{destroyer}} reintroduces the tumblehome {{hull form}}, a hull form not seen {{to this extent}} since the Russo-Japanese War in 1905. It was originally put forth in modern steel battleship designs by the French shipyard Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée in La Seyne, Toulon. French naval architects believed that tumblehome, in which the beam of the vessel narrowed from the waterline to the upper deck, would create better freeboard, greater seaworthiness, and, as Russian battleships were to find, would be ideal for navigating through narrow constraints (e.g. canals). On the downside, the tumblehome battleships leaked and could be unstable, especially when turning at high speed. The tumblehome has been reintroduced {{in the 21st century}} to reduce the <b>radar</b> <b>return</b> of the hull. The inverted bow is designed to cut through waves rather than ride over them. The stability of this hull form in high sea states has caused debate among naval architects, with some charging that [...] "with the waves coming at you from behind, when a ship pitches down, it can lose transverse stability as the stern comes out of the water—and basically roll over." ...|$|E

Between 500 and 200 feet, the instructor pilot also reported a lateral deviation which they attempted to correct.|$|E

40|$|Frame {{processing}} method offers a model鄄based approach to Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) imaging. It {{also provides a}} way to estimate the rotation rate of a non鄄cooperative target from <b>radar</b> <b>returns</b> via the frame operator properties. In this paper, {{the relationship between the}} best achievable ISAR image and the reconstructed image from <b>radar</b> <b>returns</b> was derived in the framework of Finite Frame Processing theory. We show that image defocusing caused by the use of an incorrect target rotation rate is interpreted under the FP method as a frame operator mismatch problem which causes energy dispersion. The unknown target rotation rate may be computed by optimizing the frame operator via a prominent point. Consequently, a prominent intensity maximization method in FP framework was proposed to estimate the underlying target rotation rate from <b>radar</b> <b>returns.</b> In addition, an image filtering technique was implemented to assist searching for a prominent point in practice. The proposed method is justified via a simulation analysis on the performance of FP imaging versus target rotation rate error. Effectiveness of the proposed method is also confirmed from real ISAR data experiments...|$|R
