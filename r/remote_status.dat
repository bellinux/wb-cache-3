40|$|A {{discussion}} {{is given in}} this paper of {{a new approach to}} the Safing and Arming of aerospace ordnance systems interconnected by detonation transfer lines, in which the conventional type of S&A device normally used for this purpose is replaced by a relatively simple electro-mechanical switching device, referred to as an 'Interrupter. ' In this approach the Interrupter, which is interposed in the transfer line between the system initiator and output device, is completely passive in that it contains no pyrotechnic devices or materials. Being passive (therefore, non-initiating), the Interrupter is much less hazardous to handle and install, as well as being significantly less complex and costly than conventional S&A devices containing EED's and explosive leads. Details are presented relative to the design, development and qualification, by PS/EDD, of an ordnance transfer Interrupter intended for use on a commercial launch missile. This device, which is capable of simultaneously 'switching' multiple detonation transfer lines, incorporates a rod-type rotary barrier with independent transverse apertures for each transfer line. Barrier actuation is bi-modal, i. e., the barrier can be driven from safe-to-arm or from arm-to-safe positions by independent electro-mechanical actuators. The Interrupter described also features visual and <b>remote</b> <b>status</b> monitoring provisions and, in common with range-approved conventional S&A devices, a pre-flight safety locking mechanism functioned by a removable safing key...|$|E
40|$|The Network Queuing System, NQS, is a {{versatile}} batch and device queuing facility {{for a single}} Unix computer {{or a group of}} networked computers. With the Unix operating system as a common interface, the user can invoke the NQS collection of user-space programs to move batch and device jobs freely around the different computer hardware tied into the network. NQS provides facilities for remote queuing, request routing, <b>remote</b> <b>status,</b> queue status controls, batch request resource quota limits, and remote output return. This program was developed {{as part of an effort}} aimed at tying together diverse UNIX based machines into NASA's Numerical Aerodynamic Simulator Processing System Network. This revision of NQS allows for creating, deleting, adding and setting of complexes that aid in limiting the number of requests to be handled at one time. It also has improved device-oriented queues along with some revision of the displays. NQS was designed to meet the following goals: 1) Provide for the full support of both batch and device requests. 2) Support all of the resource quotas enforceable by the underlying UNIX kernel implementation that are relevant to any particular batch request and its corresponding batch queue. 3) Support remote queuing and routing of batch and device requests throughout the NQS network. 4) Support queue access restrictions through user and group access lists for all queues. 5) Enable networked output return of both output and error files to possibly remote machines. 6) Allow mapping of accounts across machine boundaries. 7) Provide friendly configuration and modification mechanisms for each installation. 8) Support status operations across the network, without requiring a user to log in on remote target machines. 9) Provide for file staging or copying of files for movement to the actual execution machine. To support batch and device requests, NQS v. 2 implements three queue types [...] batch, device and pipe. Batch queues hold and prioritize batch requests; device queues hold and prioritize device requests; pipe queues transport both batch and device requests to other batch, device, or pipe queues at local or remote machines. Unique to batch queues are resource quota limits that restrict the amounts of different resources that a batch request can consume during execution. Unique to each device queue is a set of one or more devices, such as a line printer, to which requests can be sent for execution. Pipe queues have associated destinations to which they route and deliver requests. If the proper destination machine is down or unreachable, pipe queues are able to requeue the request and deliver it later when the destination is available. All NQS network conversations are performed using the Berkeley socket mechanism as ported into the respective vendor kernels. NQS is written in C language. The generic UNIX version (ARC- 13179) has been successfully implemented on a variety of UNIX platforms, including Sun 3 and Sun 4 series computers, SGI IRIS computers running IRIX 3. 3, DEC computers running ULTRIX 4. 1, AMDAHL computers running UTS 1. 3 and 2. 1, platforms running BSD 4. 3 UNIX. The IBM RS/ 6000 AIX version (COS- 10042) is a vendor port. NQS 2. 0 will also communicate with the Cray Research, Inc. and Convex, Inc. versions of NQS. The standard distribution medium for either machine version of NQS 2. 0 is a 60 Mb, QIC- 24,. 25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge in UNIX tar format. Upon request the generic UNIX version (ARC- 13179) can be provided in UNIX tar format on alternate media. Please contact COSMIC to discuss the availability and cost of media to meet your specific needs. An electronic copy of the NQS 2. 0 documentation is included on the program media.

The ANSI Standard for a CAAS uses a free-in-air dose rate to define the detection criteria for a minimum accident-of-concern.

We hypothesized that left ventricular scarring untouched by operation would negatively affect postoperative outcome. MethodsIn 15 consecutive patients (mean age 61 ± 12 years, mean left ventricular ejection fraction 20 % ± 7. 5 %), left ventricular assessments by magnetic resonance imaging and right heart catheterization were performed before and after operation. Left ventricular basal scarring remote from surgical exclusion site was quantified from hyperenhancement area on preoperative delayed-enhancement magnetic resonance imaging as percentage of fibrosis (total infarct size relative to ventricular mass). ResultsCalculated percentage of fibrosis varied from 0 % to 29. 9 % (mean 12 % ± 9. 6 %). Percentage of fibrosis linearly correlated with significantly worse postoperative hemodynamic variables and left ventricular function recovery: left ventricular ejection fraction (P =. 0005, R = − 0. 79), left ventricular end-systolic volume index (P =. 05, R = 0. 51), mean pulmonary arterial pressure (P =. 004, R = 0. 70), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (P =. 009, R = 0. 65), and cardiac index (P =. 005, R = − 0. 69).

In this paper, we present a general approach for sensor’s information processing and analysis based on Big Data concepts and to describe the use of common tools and techniques for storing, filtering and processing data coming from sensors in an ICU using a distributed architecture based on cloud computing. The proposed system has been developed around Big Data paradigms using bio-signals sensors information and machine learning algorithms for prediction of outcomes.

40|$|Rangeland {{monitoring}} services {{require the}} capability to investigate vegetation condition and to assess biomass production, especially in areas where local livelihood depends on rangeland <b>status.</b> <b>Remote</b> sensing solutions are strongly recommended, where the systematic acquisition of field data is not feasible and does not guarantee properly describing the spatio-temporal dynamics of wide areas. Recent research on semi-arid rangelands has focused its attention on the evaporative fraction (EF), a key factor to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) in the energy balance (EB) algorithm. EF is strongly linked to the vegetation water status, and works conducted on eddy covariance towers used this parameter to increase the performances of satellite-based biomass estimation. In this work, a method to estimate EF from MODIS products, originally developed for evapotranspiration estimation, is tested and evaluated. Results show that the EF estimation from low spatial resolution over wide semi-arid area is feasible. Estimated EF resulted in being well correlated to field ET measurements, and the spatial patterns of EF maps are {{in agreement with the}} well-known climatic and landscape Sahelian features. The preliminary test on rangeland biomass production shows that satellite-retrieved EF as a water availability factor significantly increased the capacity of a remote sensing operational product to detect the variability of the field biomass measurements...|$|R
