A kind {{of bamboo}} char with high {{specific}} surface {{area has been}} studied as the absorption material of the activated carbon electrodes, and the electrosorptive deionization ability of the as-obtained electrodes for elimination of metal ions in tap water has been examined under certain direct voltage. The effects of {{the distance between the}} elect <b>rode</b> <b>plates,</b> and the numbers of the electrode plates have been investigated in detail. The results show that the electrodes exhibit the optimal deionization ability over 2 cm of distance between the electrode plates and 4 couples of the elect <b>rode</b> <b>plates.</b> The reverse wash treatment indicates that the activated carbon electrodes can be cycle used. The efficiency order of the electrosorptive deionization of different metal ions on the activated carbon electrode has been summarized as follows: P...|$|R

50|$|The Tacoma Fault Zone {{marks the}} south end of the Seattle Uplift, of which the similar and related Seattle Fault Zone marks the north end. This uplift is {{believed}} to be either a slab of rock about 15 km thick being pushed up a ramp, or a wedge being popped up between these two faults, by tectonic forces from the south or south-west as tectonic <b>plates</b> <b>riding</b> on top of the Juan de Fuca Plate are pushed against the North American craton.|$|R

5|$|The {{mechanically}} rigid {{outer layer}} of Earth, the lithosphere, {{is divided into}} pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent boundaries, at which two plates come together, divergent boundaries, at which two plates are pulled apart, and transform boundaries, in which two plates slide past one another laterally. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries. The tectonic <b>plates</b> <b>ride</b> {{on top of the}} asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.|$|R
50|$|Some early {{models of}} plate {{tectonics}} envisioned the <b>plates</b> <b>riding</b> {{on top of}} convection cells like conveyor belts. However, most scientists working today believe that the asthenosphere does not directly cause motion by the friction of such basal forces. The North American Plate is nowhere being subducted, yet it is in motion. Likewise the African, Eurasian and Antarctic Plates. The subducting slabs around the Pacific Ring of Fire cool down the Earth and its Core-mantle boundary, around the African Plate the upwelling mantle plumes from the Core-mantle boundary produce rifting. The overall driving force for plate motion and its energy source remain subjects of ongoing research.|$|R

50|$|Marlow {{settled in}} Rugeley, Staffordshire, a short {{distance}} from the racing stables at Hednesford. The trainers who worked in the area at the time included Thomas Walters, Thomas Carr, William Saunders, Thomas Flintoff, and Samuel Lord. Owners who had their horses in training at Hednesford included Edmund Peel (brother of Sir Robert Peel), Aldermand William Taylor Copeland, Captain Thomas Lamb and Lord Warwick. Marlow rode for many of them and had early wins on Copeland’s King Cole in the 1838 Chester Cup, and three days later for Captain Lamb in the Marquis of Westminster’s <b>Plate</b> <b>riding</b> Chit Chat. Marlowe continued to ride for Alderman Copeland for several years, primarily in the Staffordshire and midland districts. He rode Copeland’s outsider Mustapha Muley in the 1841 Epsom Derby and Combermere the following year, both unplaced. In a review of the 1842 season he was among the country’s top winning jockeys.|$|R

On November 2, 1991 Villeneuve became the first woman to ride in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, and was only the second in any Breeders' Cup race, as American Julie Krone had previously ridden at the Breeders' Cup in both 1988 and 1989.|$|R
5000|$|Yet another oddity is this carriage, {{this time}} {{originating}} from the Foxdale Railway. It {{was built by}} the Oldbury Railway Carriage and Wagon Co in 1886 for the small branch to Foxdale; this is a true survivor {{of the system and}} is still in operation today. It is the smallest bogie carriage on the system being only 30' 0" [...] long, and <b>rides</b> on <b>plate</b> frame bogies. As constructed it had four third class compartments and a small luggage and guard's compartment complete with lookout duckets, which took up a little over a third of the length of the vehicle. One of the compartments was converted into a first class section, which led to the carriage acquiring the nickname Kitto's Coach after the Captain of the Foxdale Mines who had a first class free pass on the Manx Northern. It was converted into a camping coach in 1967 and painted into a non-typical blue and yellow livery. In 1979 to mark the occasion of the centenary of the Manx Northern Railway, it was painted into original livery and re-numbered No. 15 for a spell, before reverting to fleet livery of purple lake and regaining the fleet number F.39. She carried the red and cream livery from 1999 until 2013 when the coach was repainted into the Manx Northern Railway livery and renumbered M.N.Ry. No. 17. The first class compartment was also reinstated at this time reducing the seating capacity by two seats as armrests were provided.|$|R
50|$|The geology of the {{mountain}} is complex and has features {{different from the rest}} of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The San Andreas Fault runs along the base of Monte Bello Ridge, of which Black Mountain is the highest point at 2812 ft. It is the second highest summit on the Sierra Morena portion of the Santa Cruz Mountains, after Castle Rock at 3214 ft. Everything west of the San Andreas fault rides to the northwest on the Pacific Plate's Salinian Block, which is made up largely of Mesozoic-era granitic rocks, similar to those of the Sierra Nevada, and overlain by more recent sedimentary rocks of marine origin. East of the fault, the North American <b>Plate</b> <b>rides</b> to the southeast, and here the bedrock is the Franciscan Assemblage, made up of rocks common in the Bay Area such as sandstone, basalt, and metamorphics. On the very summit of Black Mountain are Calera limestone rocks which are relatively unique in the Bay Area. Microfossils in the limestone deposits suggest that {{the mountain}} originated as a seamount at 22 degrees north in the tropical Pacific about 100 million years ago and was transported to Los Altos by the Pacific Plate. These rocks occur as jagged gray boulders and outcrops just southwest of the radio towers on the summit, as well as in the large Permanente Quarry downhill east of the preserve where the limestone is mined to produce cement. Calera is the Spanish word for 'limekiln', reflecting how limestone was burned historically to produce lime, a key ingredient for mortar. The summit is also unusual as it is higher than the Skyline Ridge to the west, allowing a view of the ocean on a clear day.|$|R
40|$|Studies of the {{evolution}} of hotspot swells, mantle plumes, and Hawaiian basalts are presented in three parts in this dissertation. In part 1, {{the evolution}} of mid-plate hotspot swells are simulated numerically as an oceanic <b>plate</b> <b>rides</b> over a hot, upwelling mantle plume. The transient heat transfer equations, with time- and space-dependent boundary conditions, are solved in cylindrical coordinates. Geophysical data are used to constrain the models. Formation of the Hawaiian swell requires a mechanism of convective thinning of the lithosphere. The models constrain the Hawaiian heat source to have a maximum anomalous temperature of 250 - 300 °C, and a perturbing heat flux 5 - 6 times the background value. On the other hand, the Bermuda swell is likely produced by heat conduction due to weakness of the heat source. In part 2, an analytic model of axisymmetric mantle plumes is presented. Plume parameters beneath the lithosphere, which are constrained from the swell models, are used to infer the plume source regions. The Hawaiian plume likely originates near the core-mantle boundary, but other hotspots may have shallower sources. Chemical plumes are much narrower than thermal plumes because of low chemical diffusivity in the mantle. For mantle plumes driven by combined thermal-chemical diffusion, the chemical signature of the source regions may only be observed near plume centers. Finally, melt generation and extraction along the Hawaiian volcanic chain are discussed in part 3. As a part of the plate moves over the heat source, melting largely takes place in the region where the lithospheric material is engulfed and swept away by the flow of the heat source. At least three mantle components must be involved in the melt generation: the plume material, the asthenosphere, and the engulfed lithospheric material. Significant amount of melts may also come from direct melting of the upwelling plume at depths below the initial plate-plume boundary. Melt extracts continuously from an active partial melting zone of 10 - 20 km thick, which moves outward as heating and compaction proceed. The models explain quantitatively the general characteristics of Hawaiian volcanism as the result of plume-plate interaction...|$|R
