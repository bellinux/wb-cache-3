40|$|Economic {{integration}} in East Asia {{has been largely}} market driven. Attempts in the late 1980 s to establish an East Asian <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>grouping</b> failed to materialize {{for a number of}} reasons. The financial crisis in 1997 – 1998 has strengthened the realization of regional countries that they need to have some self-help mechanisms to overcome that crisis and to prevent future crises. This {{led to the development of}} several functional integration programs, including the network of bilateral swap arrangements known as the Chiang Mai Initiative. However, progress remains slow.

40|$|The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is a <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>grouping</b> of 15 {{countries}} whose common {{vision is}} to promote economic, social and political development and growth. Arguably, sustainable growth can be realized if there is equal access to all positions of power and influence in the area, but an investigation of 117 universities revealed that while 105 universities (89. 7 %) are led by male presidents, only 12 universities (10. 3 %) are led by females. Only 6 of the 15 countries had institutions led by female presidents. This paper postulates that the gender gap in the university presidency is attributable {{to the theory of}} hierarchical marginalization—a theory that avers that men predominantly seek to control productive sectors of the economy, while relegating women to the reproductive sectors that have comparatively less influence. The paper concludes by suggesting ways that SADC countries could address gender equity in the university leadership with the goal advancing development in the region...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to assess}} the {{implications}} of the Asian economic crisis of 1997 / 98 and Singapore’s current initiatives to forge extra-ASEAN free trade agreements for the future of ASEAN economic integration. Have the recent crisis and the resulting economic difficulties undermined ASEAN’s resolve to deepen their level of economic integration? Would Singapore’s current initiatives at forging free trade deals with countries outside the region undermine the region’s economic integration? The perception by some members in ASEAN that these bilateral free trade deals {{can be used as a}} “backdoor ” entry into the ASEAN markets is particularly a matter of serious concern, which could threaten the very existence of ASEAN as a <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>grouping.</b> It is argued that the recent crisis has instead galvanised ASEAN countries’ determination to move forward in economic integration and on the basis of the most recent trends, there is strong indication that the political resolve is likely to be translated into concrete measures. However, there remain other more challenging tasks before the vision of a regional free trade can be realised. Further, the fear that Singapore’s FTAs with othe...|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} massive foreign {{economic}} aid to countries in South Asia and {{their efforts to}} improve their export earnings through export subsidies, there persists an uncertainty regarding the quantity of annual aid. This, together with instability in their export earnings, has affected the economic performance {{of the countries in}} the region. Even the protective tariff policies of these countries act as an obstacle in utilizing available technology and resources efficiently. The United Nations Conferences on Trade and Development emphasize on increased trade among developing countries. An establishment of a common market or any other form of economic groupings will encourage trade and economic co-operation between the countries of South Asia in particular and developing countries in general. Economists like Tinbergen has visualized a possibility of an integrated market between countries of Indian subcontinent. This study attempts to explore such a possibility. The study, being explorative, is certainly conjuctural in nature. Yet an attempt has been made to demonstrate that if a <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>grouping</b> is worked out between countries of South Asia, it will through trade creation and trade diverting effects, succeed in realizing the following: 1. The area as a whole, through trade among countries of the area, is likely to attain self-sufficiency in foodgrains. This will, in itself, impart momentum to economic development in the region. 2. The extended size of the market will provide a better opportunity for utilizing modern methods of production. The exploitation of complimentarities in industrial production will result in a better utilization of available irreproducible resources of the region. Such complimentarities could be explored in petroleum refining, petro-chemical, fertilizer production, packaging, and agriculture. 3. Such an effort demands an intensive study of the existing policies. This should be undertaken through the establishment of regional planning and regional trade and tariff commissions. 4. This study emphasizes that a removal of tariffs, on trade between these countries and acceptance of a common agreed tariff on imports from non-member countries, will act as an incentive for rapid agricultural and industrial development in the region...|$|E

Our basic assumption is that the way in which each country engages in international trade and global capital flows affects, positively or negatively, structural change and the catch-up trajectory. Though our results cannot confirm Russia’s long-term growth trajectory, they do confirm that over the period analysed China and India have shown a rapid catching up path, while Brazil and South Africa have entered into a falling behind path.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between regional and national identities {{in the age of}} globalisation, with particular reference to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). For members of ASEAN, economic integration is seen as a necessary step forward in order to (i) reduce reliance on Western countries during times of economic crisis and (ii) speed up the recovery process {{in the aftermath of a}} crisis. The concept of an ASEAN Economic Community represents a step towards achieving this goal. However, by means of a case study, this paper demonstrates that the idea of an ASEAN Economic Community does not yet have sufficiently solid foundations. Cracks appear when member states act in response to national interest. Given the frequency of friction between member nations, and the fact that ASEAN members are quite diverse in both economic and cultural respects, there is still much more to be done to realise the objective of forming an effective and credible <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>group.</b> In this paper some suggestions are offered that might assist with the achievement of this goal...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} Tripartite Free Trade Area (T-FTA) of the EAC-SADC-COMESA {{in eastern}} and southern Africa has been received with both optimism and pessimism in many quarters. The optimism concerning the prospects of the proposed T-FTA, though often exaggerated, is not totally unfounded as it could help African Economic Community (AEC) strengthen intra-RECs, and inter-RECs integration by reducing the incidence of multiple memberships and proliferation of <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> and subgroups, among other things. With the use of qualitative method and some indices from the secondary sources, and by propounding a new theory of post-neo-functionalism, a combination or a synthesis of neo-nationalism and post-nationalism, this paper concludes that the proposed Tripartite Free Trade Area (T-FTA) would be confronted with some potential challenges capable of, not just overcoming, but torpedoing these prospects. The paper seeks to deconstruct and problematize neo-functionalism in Africa as well as rejects neo-functionalist, one-size-fits-all, state-centric or inter-governmental approach to integration in Africa, and rather recommends bottom-top, humanistic, people-centric or private-sector-driven approach to integration, or people-to-people integration.

For the Caribbean, the simplest way to find this information is to consult the websites of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and that of the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), both of which are regularly updated. For Africa, where there are a number of regional trading blocs, several websites give visitors a broader view of these groups. The website of the African Union is a useful site and offers links to the various blocs. For a quick overview, try the website of The Hub, a CTA partner, which briefly outlines the main regional organisations. These are clearly mapped out on Africa Renewal, the website for the Africa Section of the United Nations Department of Public Information. The website of West African Borders and Integration (Sahel and West Africa Club/OECD) presents concrete examples of integration in the field, an aspect which is often lacking in institutional sites.

40|$|Modern {{trends are}} {{associated}} with the integration and globalization. Integration is an immanent property of all systems and {{is the result of the}} evolution. Integration has its positive and negative effects. The degree of the progress towards the global economy is measured by the integration level in terms of the market integration indicators and the economic convergence. The latent characteristic of the globalization as a process of a unified system creation is the synchronization assuming the coincidence of the economic development ascending and descending trends in time. The coincidence of the tempo-rhythms is studied on the basis of coefficients of the pair correlation of relative growth rates of GDP for 1995 - 2010 in 175 countries. The very high degree of synchronization of economic dynamics is revealed in the European Union countries and in the United States. The low level of the tempo-rhythm synchronization is registered on the territory of the CIS countries. Russia occupies 29 th position in the world ranking. The study of the dependence of the economic instability in the world during the crisis of 2008 - 2009 on the level of the tempo-rhythm coincidence shows that the more synchronized economic dynamics is, the greater excess coefficient of the average dynamics is observed during the crisis period.

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 2 nd World War, we have {{witnessed}} a tremendous amount of world trade expansion. This has been in part caused by the favourable international trading environment provided by the public good, the GATT, aided by the politico-economic hegemony of the United States of America. Korea took advantage of this favourable situation by pursuing an economic development strategy of export-led growth. As the US hegemony began to decline, the formation of a multipolar system based upon regional blocs, has given a new dimension to Korea's international trade. In EU-ROK economic relations, regionalism and globalization of world trade has brought Korea both challenges and opportunities. The case study of Korea's leading electronics firms clearly suggests the requirement for the maintenance of a physical presence through FDI to conduct business successfully in the European market. The new international, politico-economic order obliges firms outside a regional body to locate marketing, manufacturing or even product development within the territories of a <b>regional</b> <b>economic</b> <b>group</b> to avoid NTBS such as anti-dumping. Economic interaction between the European Union, a giant of regionalism with potential economic power and the Republic of Korea, a forerunner among newly industrialized nations, highly vulnerable to outer setting, seems to be regulated by rules and norms, like the pendulum moving between the two extremes of protectionism and a free, liberal trading environment. The study attempts to show that Korea's exports to the EU market will increase more and more as the pendulum moves toward the free trade logic based upon multilateralism. In order accurately to analyse the EU-Korean economic relationship, a better understanding of regionalism and globalization of World trade should be added to the existing literature on the international political economy (Realism, Liberalism, Marxism). The general assumption of the study is based upon economic liberalism which puts much focus on economic efficiency. As a model of deep economic integration, whether the European Union is strongly committed to multilateralism or resorts to protectionist trade regimes such as anti-dumping, quantitative restrictions, or local content rules, will be a major determinant of EU-Korea trade interaction in the future because Korea will continually pursue economic development with export-oriented characteristics. The maximization of EU-ROK economic exchanges will be achieved only when the world trading system is committed to multilateralism under the WTO in general, and the EU's pursuit of open regionalism to reduce NTBs against the ROK in particular. Of course, Korea should make reciprocal efforts further to liberalize and deregulate its trade regimes by opening more markets to foreign products. Korea's active pursuit of globalization and localization strategies to penetrate into the EU market is a prerequisite for a continuous rapid growth of the Korean economy...|$|R
