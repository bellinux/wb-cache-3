50|$|Construction of {{traditional}} wooden Chinese furniture is based primarily of solid wood pieces connected solely using woodworking joints, and rarely using glue or metallic nails. The {{reason was that}} nails and glues used did not stand up well to the vastly fluctuating temperatures and humid weather conditions in most of Central and South-East Asia. As well, the highly oily and <b>resinous</b> <b>woods</b> used in Chinese furniture do not glue well, even when pre-cleaned with modern industrial solvents.|$|E
50|$|Retene, methyl {{isopropyl}} phenanthrene or 1-methyl-7-isopropyl phenanthrene, C18H18, is a polycyclic {{aromatic hydrocarbon}} present in the coal tar fraction, boiling above 360 °C. It occurs naturally in the tars obtained by the distillation of <b>resinous</b> <b>woods.</b> It crystallizes in large plates, which melt at 98.5 °C and boil at 390 °C. It is readily soluble in warm ether and in hot glacial acetic acid. Sodium and boiling amyl alcohol reduce it to a tetrahydroretene, whilst if it be heated with phosphorus and hydriodic acid to 260 °C, a dodecahydride is formed. Chromic acid oxidizes it to retene quinone, phthalic acid and acetic acid. It forms a picrate which melts at 123-124 °C.|$|E
30|$|The {{composting}} {{process and}} accelerated weathering of <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> particles led to different chemical changes after 12 and 24 weeks, respectively, as revealed by spectral features. Figure  4 compares the spectral characteristics of <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> and <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> that {{was subjected to}} a composting process for 12 (<b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> composted 12 weeks) and 24 weeks (<b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> composted 24 weeks). Whereas the aromatic skeletal vibration of lignin at 1510  cm−[*] 1 decreases considerably due to weathering (see Fig.  2), the band is not affected by composting. Due to the composting process the main resin band at 1688  cm−[*] 1 shows a more conspicuous reduction. The lower intensity of this band is paralleled by the decrease of the bands at 2815 and 2865  cm−[*] 1 that are also assigned to resin acids, whereas the band at 3320  cm−[*] 1 (O–H vibrations) increase.|$|R

30|$|In {{the scores}} {{plot of the}} PCA (Fig.  5) <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> and {{composted}} <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> samples are located along the first principal component. The groups partly overlap. According to the loadings of the first principal component the bands at 2925, 2865 and 1688  cm−[*] 1 (resin acids), and the region 1240 – 1030  cm−[*] 1 (cellulose) contribute to sample segregation. Two samples that were composted for a longer time are located in a major distance. Weathered <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> samples are separated by the second principal component. Bands at 2925 and 2865  cm−[*] 1 and the region 1240 – 1030  cm−[*] 1 (cellulose) are also responsible for the grouping, but the strongest effect is caused by broadening and shifting of the band at 1688  cm−[*] 1.|$|R

50|$|No {{treatment}} of timber to prevent attack by Teredo navalis {{has been completely}} successful. Experiments by the Dutch in the 19th century proved the inefficacy of linseed oil, metallic paint, powdered glass, carbonization (i.e., burning the outer layers of the wood), and any of the usual biocides such as chromated copper arsenate. They also attempted covering wooden pylons with precisely arranged iron nails, but this too had no lasting effect. In 1878 {{it was discovered that}} creosote was an effective deterrent, though to work best it had to be applied to soft, <b>resinous</b> <b>woods</b> like pine; in order to work on harder woods such as oak, special care had to be taken to ensure the wood was completely permeated by the creosote. Submerged wrecks have been protected by wrapping them in geotextiles to provide a physical barrier to the larvae or by reburying them in the sediment. No permanent solution has been found..|$|E

5000|$|Many {{traditional}} wood joinery techniques use {{the distinctive}} material properties of wood, often {{without resorting to}} mechanical fasteners or adhesives. While every culture in which pieces of wood are joined together to make furniture or structures has a joinery tradition, wood joinery techniques have been especially well documented and is celebrated in the Indian, Chinese, European, and Japanese traditions. Because of the actual physical existence of Indian and Egyptian examples, we know that furniture from the first several dynasties show the use of complex joints, like the Dovetail, over 5 thousand years ago. This tradition continued to other later Western styles. The 18th century writer Diderot included over 90 detailed illustrations of wood joints in his comprehensive encyclopedia. While Western techniques focused on concealment of joinery, the Eastern societies, though later, {{did not attempt to}} [...] "hide" [...] their joints. The Japanese and Chinese traditions in particular required the use of hundreds of types of joints. The reason was that nails and glues used did not stand up well to the vastly fluctuating temperatures and humid weather conditions in most of Central and South-East Asia. As well, the highly <b>resinous</b> <b>woods</b> used in traditional Chinese furniture do not glue well, even if they are pre-cleaned with solvents and attached using modern glues.|$|E

30|$|The average {{spectra of}} <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> and {{heartwood}} of tapped pines {{before and after}} accelerated weathering indicate the responsible regions for sample segregation. They are displayed in Fig.  2. Weathering causes several changes. The concerned bands are listed in Table  2. The band at 1510  cm−[*] 1 (lignin) almost disappears, whereas the bands in the area from 1240 to 1030  cm−[*] 1 (cellulose) show a relative increase. The chemical process is paralleled by a noticeable change of color from brown to gray. The band at about 1688  cm−[*] 1 that can be assigned to the carbonyl stretch vibration of resin acids, features the most distinct change. The decrease of band intensity is weaker in <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> than in heartwood where the decrease of this band is paralleled by the relative increase of the C–O–C vibration (cellulose) at 1030  cm−[*] 1.|$|R
60|$|So heartily had the men laboured that in {{the hour}} and a half that had elapsed since Philo had arrived a large hut had been erected a hundred yards from the camp, with a small bower beside it {{for the use of the}} female slaves.

50|$|Agarwood or aloeswood is a {{fragrant}} dark <b>resinous</b> <b>wood</b> used in incense and perfume. It {{is formed}} in the heartwood of aquilaria trees when they become infected with a type of mould. Prior to infection, the heartwood is odourless, relatively light and pale coloured; however, as the infection progresses, the tree produces a dark aromatic resin, called aloes or agar (as well as gaharu, jinko, oud, or oodh; {{not to be confused}} with bukhoor), in response to the attack, which results in a very dense, dark, resin embedded heartwood. The resin embedded wood is valued in many cultures for its distinctive fragrance, and thus is used for incense and perfumes.|$|R
