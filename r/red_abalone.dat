40|$|Surveys of 39 random 30 -m 2 subtidal {{stations}} and 56 random 1 / 4 -m 2 subtidal stations in Diablo Cove and the North Control were completed. The mean density of <b>red</b> <b>abalones,</b> Haliotis rufescens, in Diablo Cove was greater this year (0. 02 /m 2) {{than last year}} (0. 005 /m 2). This difference probably reflects sampling variation rather than density change. A total of 29 sportfish catch-per-unit-of-effort stations was sampled in Diablo Cove and 12 in the North Control. Foam observations in Diablo Cove were continued. The cooling water pumps were not in operation. The amounts of foam appeared {{to be about the}} same during certain weather conditions as those when the pumps are in operation, although not as thick. The number of sea otters, Enhydra lutris, decreased substantially between Pt. Buchon and Pecho Rock. This was due to their annual migration (or "pulling back") into the more central parts of their range. Random surveys of the intertidal areas during the upwelling period were completed.

40|$|Project {{efficiency}} was enhanced {{along with}} economic savings through reduced per diem costs with the move of two project biologists to the Diablo Canyon area. A total of 765 field and laboratory man-days was spent surveying 189 intertidal, subtidal, and fishing stations, processing algae samples, and compiling data. A new subtidal study of random 1 / 4 m 2 quadrats was begun {{this year to}} better assess small invertebrates. Three new permanent intertidal stations were established in transition areas outside of Diablo Cove to monitor thermal impact on <b>abalones.</b> Giant <b>red</b> sea urchin densities continued to decline in both subtidal study areas, while densities of large brown algae continued to increase. Numbers of intertidal black and <b>red</b> <b>abalones</b> from parallel to shoreline stations showed little change. Perpendicular to shore stations yielded higher mean densities of black abalones than the parallel stations. Sea otter movements and fluctuations in monthly counts generally paralleled those of previous years. The commercial sea urchin fishery was inactive most of the year, and commercial abalone fishing effort continued to decline. No effort from either fishery was observed in Diablo Cove. Observations on natural and power plant produced foam within Diablo Cove were begun during this report period...|$|R

40|$|We {{measured}} {{the effects of}} temperature on cytosolic malate dehydrogenases (cMDHs) from the shell muscle of five species of eastern Pacific abalone, genus Haliotis, found at different latitudes and/or tidal heights. The apparent Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) of coenzyme (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, NADH) was conserved within a narrow range (11 – 21 �mol l � 1) at physiological temperatures for all species. However, elevated temperatures perturbed the Km of NADH for cMDHs of the two species living at higher latitudes and/or lower tidal heights [Haliotis rufesens (red) and H. kamtschatkana kamtschatkana (pinto) ] to a much greater extent than for cMDHs of congeners from lower latitudes and/or higher tidal heights [H. fulgens (green), H. corregata (pink) and H. cracherodii (black) ]. The apparent Arrhenius activation energies for the cMDHs of these five species showed a similar interspecific divergence. Furthermore, green, pink and black abalone have cMDHs that are more resistant to thermal denaturation than are cMDHs of <b>red</b> and pinto <b>abalone.</b> Native gel electrophoresis showed that cMDHs of <b>red</b> and pinto <b>abalone</b> had identical mobilities, whereas cMDHs of green, pink and black abalone are distinct both {{from each other and}} from that of the two cold-adapted species...|$|R
40|$|Biopolymer/calcium {{carbonate}} composites {{grown on}} inorganic abiotic substrates implanted between the shell and the shell-secreting epithelium of live <b>red</b> <b>abalones</b> (Haliotis rufescens) {{results in an}} unusual highly (104) -oriented aggregate of microcrystalline calcite that precedes nacre deposition. Calcite of this orientation has never before been observed in nature. Also with this method, nacre deposition is found to correct for calcite surface roughness and chemically anomalous surfaces. Pole figure X-ray diffraction studies of these "flat pearls" provide comparisons of preferred orientation of the various mineral components of the abalone shell. Complete converslon of the aragonite in abalone nacre to hydroxyapatite in hydrothermal phosphate solution results in an oriented polycrystalline aggregate with ultrastructure preservation and an unexpected preferred orientation {{different from that of}} other biominerals and abiogenic CaC 03 samples subjected to this reaction. The new orientation, which increases with reaction time. may result from the organization of the organic matrix in the nacre, which directs the hydrothermal solution through the material. This orientation suggests strongly that the conversion proceeds via a dissolution-recrystallization mechanism, rather than by topotaxy, which was previously proposed. In addition to cellulose I, a highly oriented cellulose-II-like polymer was found in the bark of Prunus serrula, an exceptionally strong, tough. and extensible composite film. The cellulose II polymorph, which has not previously been found in nature, may be accordion-folded in the plane of the bark thickness and contribute to the strength and unusual behavior with plasticization of this natural film. The silica frustule of the diatom Skeletonema costatum has a surface area of 135 mm 2 fg and contains 1. 5 - 2 wt % occluded organic. This organic includes a water-insoluble scaffolding. When treated with organic oxidizers, the chitin secreted by the diatom Thalassiosira weisflogii forms a flexible paperlike composite. A mild, rapid synthesis of hydrated sodium aluminosilicate sodalite, Na 3 (AlSiO 4) 3. 4 H 2 O, synthesis of mesoporous silica at neutral pH, and the synthesis of gem-quality opal also are presented...|$|R
40|$|More {{stations}} were surveyed during this report period than during any previous period. A total of 818 mandays was spent surveying 18 permanent and 67 random subtidal stations, 19 permanent and 50 random intertidal stations, and 64 sportfish catch-per-unit-of-effort stations, {{as well as}} conducting corollary laboratory work. In the subtidal areas, Laminaria dentigera and Pterygophora californica, both important subsurface kelp species, increased in their combined total numbers from the 1976 survey. However, Nereocystis luetkeana, the bull kelp, declined substantially in all study areas. Population trends {{of many of the}} dominant subtidal macro-invertebrates have varied depending on the species and on the type of method utilized. Regression analyses have been performed on selected species for numbers versus depth. Red algal abundance and diversity appear to have increased in both subtidal study areas. Of the three observation areas, sea otters were observed least frequently in Diablo Cove. However, there continues to be fresh evidence of otter foraging within Diablo Cove. Several seasons' data for intertidal algae and invertebrates have been summarized for one study area. While the algae biomass shows a fairly clear seasonality of abundance, the trends in numbers of the six invertebrate species considered are not as well defined. Because of high variability in the data, the sportfish catch-per-unit-of-effort and hook-and-line study was cancelled in December. Populations of intertidal <b>red</b> and black <b>abalones,</b> Haliotis rufescens and H. cracherodii, respectively, appear to have remained fairly stable during the 1976 - 77 period. Two other ancillary studies were also terminated during this period: interviews of commercial abalone and urchin fishermen, and observations of foam in Diablo Cove. (107 pp. ...|$|R

50|$|The closer {{a village}} {{was to the}} ocean, the greater its {{reliance}} on maritime resources. Due to advanced canoe designs, coastal and island people could procure fish and aquatic mammals from farther out. Shellfish were {{a good source of}} nutrition: relatively easy to find and abundant. Many of the favored varieties grew in tidal zones. Shellfish grew in abundance during winter to early spring; their proximity to shore made collection easier. Some of the consumed species included mussels, abalone, and a wide array of clams. Haliotis rufescens (<b>red</b> <b>abalone)</b> was harvested this species along the Central California coast in the pre-contact era.

50|$|The meat (foot muscle) of abalone is {{used for}} food, and the shells of abalone are used as {{decorative}} items and {{as a source of}} mother of pearl for jewelry, buttons, buckles, and inlay. Abalone shells have been found in archaeological sites around the world, ranging from 75,000-year-old deposits at Blombos Cave in South Africa to historic Chinese abalone middens on California's Northern Channel Islands. On the Channel Islands, where abalones were harvested by Native Americans for at least 12,000 years, the size of <b>red</b> <b>abalone</b> shells found in middens declines significantly after about 4000 years ago, probably due to human predation. Worldwide, abalone pearls have also been collected for centuries.|$|E
5000|$|To date, {{significant}} progress {{has already been}} made, with the greatest development being the cultivation of the oyster in San Quintín, where it has produced over 1000 tons annually {{as well as the}} mussel and <b>red</b> <b>abalone</b> in the Bay of Ensenada, with a capacity of 200 tons. This bay is certified by the Food and Drug Administration of the United States which guarantees the quality of the products and facilitates the commercial concurrence to the markets of that country.
