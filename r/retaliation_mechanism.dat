40|$|WTO报复机制的确立被视为迄今为止多边贸易谈判史上一项非常大的成就。报复作为最后的执行手段，大大强化了WTO的执行机制，在实践中的运用也越来越多。然而报复实施的效果与胜诉方的经济实力密切相关，弱小的发展中国家由于缺乏报复能力，难以通过报复实现目的，甚至会给其自身经济发展带来损害。 本文旨在研究WTO报复机制尤其是跨协定报复的相关规定，通过对授权跨协定报复案例的实证分析，探讨仲裁员对符合授权跨协定报复案件的解释，结合败诉方执行裁决的情况对跨协定报复这一形式进行评析，进而探索WTO报复机制的改革路径。 全文共分四章。 第一章回顾了从GATT报复机制的引入，到WTO报复机制的确立这一过程，介绍 [...] . The {{establishment}} of <b>retaliation</b> <b>mechanism</b> in WTO {{has been considered}} {{as one of the}} greatest accomplishments in the history of multilateral trade negotiations. Retaliation, as the last resort of execution, significantly strengthened the execution mechanism of WTO, and the <b>retaliation</b> <b>mechanism</b> has been applied much more frequently in WTO dispute settlement.

We give theoretical reasons for which {{this has been the}} case. We also show that the <b>retaliation</b> <b>mechanism</b> which is built into the GATT-WTO rules prevents tariff wars, but does not necessarily lead to free trade. We provide an alternative retaliation rule which yields free trade as the unique equilibrium of the tariff game. ...|$|E

We give the-oretical reasons for which {{this has been the}} case.

40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{selective}} {{review of the}} literature on strategic trade policy. The main focus is on empirical applications and on attempts to extend the characterization of markets and to make the characterization of economic policy and its capabilities more realistic. More than ten years of intensive discussion have not been able eliminated the case for strategic trade policy. Recent work has shown the policy recommendations to be much more robust than previously thought. Since strategic trade policy creates collective dilemma situations, probably the most important conclusion is an increase in theoretical support for international institutions which provide <b>retaliation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to make strategic trade policy unattractive. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{diversion}} of a host's energy by a symbiont {{for its own}} benefit is {{a major source of}} instability in horizontally-transmitted mutualisms. This instability can be counter-balanced by the host's retaliation against exploiters. Such responses are crucial to the maintenance of the relationship. We focus on this issue in an obligate ant-plant mutualism in which the ants are known to partially castrate their host plant. We studied plant responses to various levels of castration in terms of (1) global vegetative investment and (2) investment in myrmecophytic traits. Castration led to a higher plant growth rate, signalling a novel case of gigantism induced by parasitic castration. On the other hand, completely castrated plants produced smaller nesting and food resources (i. e. leaf pouches and extra floral nectaries). Since the number of worker larvae is correlated to the volume of the leaf pouches, such a decrease in the investment in myrmecophytic traits demonstrates {{for the first time the}} existence of inducible <b>retaliation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> against too virulent castrating ants. Over time, this mechanism promotes an intermediate level of castration and enhances the stability of the mutualistic relationship by providing the ants with more living space while allowing the plant to reproduce...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{studies of}} the {{population}} genetics of closely associated species are necessary to properly understand the evolution of these relationships because gene flow between populations affects the partners' evolutionary potential at the local scale. As a consequence (at least for antagonistic interactions), asymmetries in {{the strength of the}} genetic structures of the partner populations can result in one partner having a co-evolutionary advantage. Here, we assess the population genetic structure of partners engaged in a species-specific and obligatory mutualism: the Neotropical ant-plant, Hirtella physophora, and its ant associate, Allomerus decemarticulatus. Although the ant cannot complete its life cycle elsewhere than on H. physophora and the plant cannot live for long without the protection provided by A. decemarticulatus, these species also have antagonistic interactions: the ants have been shown to benefit from castrating their host plant and the plant is able to retaliate against too virulent ant colonies. We found similar short dispersal distances for both partners, resulting in the local transmission of the association and, thus, inbred populations in which too virulent castrating ants face the risk of local extinction due to the absence of H. physophora offspring. On the other hand, we show that the plant populations probably experienced greater gene flow than did the ant populations, thus enhancing the evolutionary potential of the plants. We conclude that such levels of spatial structure in the partners' populations can increase the stability of the mutualistic relationship. Indeed, the local transmission of the association enables partial alignments of the partners' interests, and population connectivity allows the plant <b>retaliation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to be locally adapted to the castration behaviour of their symbionts...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe continual {{developments in the}} Iranian nuclear program have caused increased concern {{not only for the}} United States but the majority of the international community as well. While several rounds of United Nations sanctions have been placed on Iran, this has not deterred it from continuing its nuclear advancements. The United States has publicly announced that it does not support Iran's developing nuclear program and will inflict measures to ensure that it discontinues these advances. While these measures have not been clearly defined, Iran has stated that hostile actions taken by the international community, specifically the United States or Israel may result in the closure of the Strait of Hormuz. While Iran has used this threat in the past, primarily in the Iraq-Iran War its full strength has never come to fruition. This thesis aims to determine whether closing the Strait of Hormuz is a viable option as an Iranian <b>retaliation</b> <b>mechanism</b> against increased sanctions from the international community and the United States or a direct attack from either Israel or the United States by analyzing the economic, strategic, and military consequences for Iran, the United States and the Gulf Cooperation Council States.

40|$|International audienceAlgorithms {{and models}} based on game theory have {{nowadays}} become prominent techniques {{for the design}} of digital controllers for critical systems. Indeed, such techniques enable automatic synthesis: given a model of the environment and a property that the controller must enforce, those techniques automatically produce a correct controller, when it exists. In the present paper, we consider a class of concurrent, weighted, multi-player games that are well-suited to model and study the interactions of several agents who are competing for some measurable resources like energy. We prove that a subclass of those games always admit a Nash equilibrium, i. e. a situation in which all players play {{in such a way that}} they have no incentive to deviate. Moreover, the strategies yielding those Nash equilibria have a special structure: when one of the agents deviate from the equilibrium, all the others form a coalition that will enforce a <b>retaliation</b> <b>mechanism</b> that punishes the deviant agent. We apply those results to a real-life case study in which several smart houses that produce their own energy with solar panels, and can share this energy among them in micro-grid, must distribute the use of this energy along the day in order to avoid consuming electricity that must be bought from the global grid. We demonstrate that our theory allows one to synthesise an efficient controller for these houses: using penalties to be paid in the utility bill as an incentive, we force the houses to follow a pre-computed schedule that maximises the proportion of the locally produced energy that is consumed...|$|E

30|$|Recent {{research}} has also analyzed the possibility of counter-punishment. In real life, punishment without a valid reason will surely prompt <b>retaliation.</b> An effective <b>mechanism</b> to counteract the behavior of bad leaders {{is the opportunity to}} punish them in a second stage of the game, where we would expect no counter-punishments of good leaders. Research on the impact of decentralized counter-punishment has found that it decreases cooperation, punishment, and welfare because subjects retaliate at an increasing rate (Denant-Boemont et al. 2007; Nikiforakis 2008).|$|R
40|$|Mafia like behavior, where {{individuals}} cooperate {{under the}} threat of punishment, occurs not only in humans, but is also observed in several animal species. Observations suggest that avian hosts tend to accept {{a certain degree of}} parasitism in order to avoid retaliating punishment from the brood parasite. To understand under which conditions it will be beneficial for a host to cooperate, we model the interaction between hosts and parasites as an evolutionary game. In our model, the host’s behavior is plastic, and thus, its response depends on the previous interactions with the parasite. We find that such learned behavior in turn is crucial for the evolution of retaliating parasites. The abundance of this kind of mafia behavior oscillates in time and does not settle to an equilibrium. Our results suggest that <b>retaliation</b> is a <b>mechanism</b> for the parasite to evade specialization and to induce acceptance by the host...|$|R

40|$|The price {{variable}} {{is among the}} most powerful instruments in the arsenal of the executives to achieve entry deterrence objectives. There are two main pricing strategies that firms may use to defend against a competitive market entry. The first of these options, limit pricing (or entry deterring price), may be utilized prior to competitive entry. The second option, aggressive (predatory) pricing, may be executed post-entry. The effectiveness of both of these options is still controversial. For example, the Chicago School proponents argue that these strategies are anecdotal in nature. On the other hand, the rationality of such conduct has been reliably simulated by Post-Chicagoans in game theoretic settings. The potential contributions of the marketing discipline have been recognized and called upon to help resolve the conflict. 	With this dissertation, I attempt to shed light on the role that price plays in preemptive and post-entry market defense of firms. As such, the questions tackled include but are not limited to: how effective is price as an entry-deterrence tool; in conjunction with firm and market specific barriers to entry; and as a post-entry <b>retaliation</b> <b>mechanism?</b> What are the facilitating conditions for limit, aggressive (predatory), competitive and supra-competitive pricing? What are the (long-term) consequences of these strategies? Following a multi-disciplinary literature review, I present a dynamic process model and test my hypotheses in a key network industry the airline industry. Building upon the advantages of multiple methods a la triangulation, I find that both limit pricing and predatory pricing can serve as effective strategies for the incumbents market defense. Predatory use of pricing in network industries may diminish consumer welfare. Results also suggest that firm specific barriers have a more significant role in market defense than market specific barriers. Insights and frameworks based on the marketing philosophy are also presented with the hope of advancing the ongoing debate between the Chicago and Post-Chicago Schools of thought. Ph. D.

30|$|Innovative {{trends in}} the {{hospitality}} industry are manifested through the ability to generate diverse innovations, which will ensure the successful growth of a hotel (Ghorbal-Blal, 2011; Zaitseva, 2013). The large-scale application of new knowledge, {{as well as its}} combinations, generate new services, products and technologies. If a hotel is not involved in any innovative activity, its growth will sooner or later diminish and its competitiveness will be lost (Dzhandzhugazova et al., 2016). Innovation has been considered essential in measuring firm-level entrepreneurship since its inclusion in many of the seminal contributions in this stream of research (e.g., Miller and Friesen, 1982). Miller and Friesen (1982), developed two competing models of innovation, depending on the goals and type of organization: the conservative model and the entrepreneurial model. The conservative model describes the innovative practices of organizations using innovation as a measure of defense, or as a <b>retaliation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Organizations, following this approach, normally innovate in the midst of distressful environmental or competitive situations in an attempt to regain their original market position. Environmental uncertainty and competitive pressures often instigate such action. Many companies have been able to use this type of approach to innovation as a means of competitive advantage. As Miller and Friesen, 1982 discuss, organizations utilizing the entrepreneurial model of innovation view it as a natural state of affairs with innovative practices, essential to the functioning and future of their firms. The key component of entrepreneurship is innovation and entrepreneurship theory; of which innovation recognizes entrepreneurs as a significant indicator of economic growth (Lee-Ross & Lashley, 2010; Nasution et al., 2011; Thomas et al., 2011). Entrepreneurship has been the practice of designing, initiating and running a new business, such as a setup company offering a product, process or service for sale or hire. While definitions of entrepreneurship normally center on the launching/running of new businesses and bringing up new business ideas in other to stay in business, a considerable percentage of businesses have to close up due to lack of innovative ideas, bad business decisions, lack of market demand, an economic crisis – or an amalgamation of all of these.|$|E
