5|$|According to {{the classic}} recipe, shucked oysters are wrapped in bacon which is then broiled in the oven, about three minutes per side. An early <b>recipe,</b> <b>from</b> 1902, {{suggests}} frying the skewered oysters and bacon in butter. The dish is often served on toast, though if prepared on skewers and broiled, it can be eaten straight from the skewer.|$|E
5|$|The corms of the {{tuberous}} sundews {{native to}} Australia {{are considered a}} delicacy by the Australian Aborigines. Some of these corms were also used to dye textiles, while another purple or yellow dye was traditionally prepared in the Scottish Highlands using D. rotundifolia. A sundew liqueur is also still produced using a <b>recipe</b> <b>from</b> the 14th century. It is made using fresh leaves from mainly D. capensis, D. spatulata, and D. rotundifolia.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the dish are unclear. The name most likely derives from the French anges à cheval, and {{there appears to be}} no {{significance}} in the oyster/angel and bacon/horse links. Its first occurrence, according to the Oxford English Dictionary and other sources, is in 1888, in Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management. However, there is a reference in an Australian newspaper to the dish, which includes a brief <b>recipe,</b> <b>from</b> 1882.|$|E
5|$|As its {{common name}} suggests, it is {{extremely}} bitter, though not toxic as such. This bitterness is worsened by cooking. One specimen can foul the taste of a whole meal prepared with mushrooms. Despite this, it is sold in local markets (tianguis) in Mexico. A local <b>recipe</b> <b>from</b> France, Romania and East Germany calls for stewing it in skimmed milk after which it can be eaten, or powdered and used for flavouring. The mushroom is not bitter for those who lack genetic sensitivity to bitter taste, a trait endowed by the gene TAS2R38 (taste receptor 2 member 38). The compound responsible for the bitter taste has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|Locusts are {{eaten in}} the Arabian Peninsula, {{including}} Saudi Arabia, where consumption of locusts spiked around Ramadan {{especially in the}} Al-Qassim Region in 2014, since many Saudis believe they are healthy to eat; however, the Saudi Ministry of Health warned that pesticides they used against the locusts made them unsafe; and Kuwait. Yemenis also consume locusts, and expressed discontent over governmental plans to use pesticides to control them. ʻAbd al-Salâm Shabînî described a locust <b>recipe</b> <b>from</b> Morocco. 19th century European travellers observed Arabs in Arabia, Egypt, and Morocco selling, cooking, and eating locusts. They reported that in Egypt and Palestine locusts were consumed. They reported that in Palestine, around the River Jordan, in Egypt, in Arabia, and in Morocco that Arabs ate locusts, while Syrian peasants did not eat locusts.|$|E

25|$|The {{size and}} shape of a large cotton reel, these little sweet, spiced mutton pies are a golden brown, crispy pastry with a moist, sweet inside. They can be eaten as an hors d'oeuvre, with a salad or as a dessert. They are cooked in {{patisseries}} all over the town, but their origin is far from local. Tradition has it that Lord Clive brought the <b>recipe</b> <b>from</b> India and taught it to the pastry makers of Pézenas when he was staying at the Château de Larzac in 1768. It is more likely is that his servants were responsible.|$|E
