40|$|The {{objective}} of the present work was to review the availability and predictive value of non-animal toxicokinetic approaches and to evaluate their current use in European <b>risk</b> <b>evaluations</b> of food contaminants, additives and food contact materials, as well as pesticides and medicines. Results revealed little use of quantitative animal or human kinetic data in <b>risk</b> <b>evaluations</b> of food chemicals, compared with pesticides and medicines. <b>Risk</b> <b>evaluations</b> of medicines provided sufficient in vivo kinetic data from different species to evaluate the predictive value of animal kinetic data for humans. These data showed a relatively poor correlation between the in vivo bioavailability in rats and dogs versus that in humans. In contrast, in vitro (human) kinetic data have been demonstrated to provide adequate predictions of the fate of compounds in humans, using appropriate in vitro-in vivo scalers and by integration of in vitro kinetic data with in silico kinetic modelling. Even though in vitro kinetic data {{were found to be}} occasionally included within <b>risk</b> <b>evaluations</b> of food chemicals, particularly results from Caco- 2 absorption experiments and in vitro data on gut-microbial conversions, only minor use of in vitro methods for metabolism and quantitative in vitro-in vivo extrapolation methods was identified. Yet, such quantitative predictions are essential in the development of alternatives to animal testing as well as to increase human relevance of toxicological <b>risk</b> <b>evaluations.</b> Future research should aim at further improving and validating quantitative alternative methods for kinetics, thereby increasing regulatory acceptance of non-animal kinetic data...|$|R

[...] They live above their government-built family medicine offices, living directly in the communities they serve and available 24 hours a day. These teams work to improve the public health concerns in the environment as well as provide medical care. [...] They perform a neighborhood health diagnosis biannually where community risk factors are evaluated to focus priorities for improving the health of the community. Clinically, family doctor-and-nurse teams follow the Continuous Assessment and <b>Risk</b> <b>Evaluation</b> (CARE) method which monitors individual and family health by examining community and home environments, current health, and medical history.

These teams' role combine the importance of focusing on both public health and clinical medicine.|$|E
2500|$|An {{insurance}} underwriter's job is {{to evaluate}} a given risk as to {{the likelihood that a}} loss will occur. Any factor that causes a greater likelihood of loss should theoretically be charged a higher rate. This basic principle of insurance must be followed if insurance companies are to remain solvent. Thus, [...] "discrimination" [...] against (i.e., negative differential treatment of) potential insureds in the <b>risk</b> <b>evaluation</b> and premium-setting process is a necessary by-product of the fundamentals of insurance underwriting. For instance, insurers charge older people significantly higher premiums than they charge younger people for term life insurance. Older people are thus treated differently from younger people (i.e., a distinction is made, discrimination occurs). The rationale for the differential treatment {{goes to the heart of}} the risk a life insurer takes: Old people are likely to die sooner than young people, so the risk of loss (the insured's death) is greater in any given period of time and therefore the risk premium must be higher to cover the greater risk. However, treating insureds differently when there is no actuarially sound reason for doing so is unlawful discrimination.|$|E
