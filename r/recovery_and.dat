40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} service <b>recovery,</b> stability <b>and</b> controllability attribution, <b>recovery</b> satisfaction, <b>and</b> customer loyalty. We collected data on service recovery, failure attribution, <b>recovery</b> satisfaction, <b>and</b> customer loyalty through a survey of airline passengers in Malaysia. The results indicate significant positive relationships between service <b>recovery</b> dimensions <b>and</b> <b>recovery</b> satisfaction, <b>and</b> between <b>recovery</b> satisfaction <b>and</b> customer loyalty. Both stability and controllability were negatively related to recovery satisfaction. The results provide support for the moderating effects of service failure attribution (stability and controllability) in the recovery process dimension. By recognizing {{the important role of}} stability and controllability attribution and its negative effects, service management should become highly involved in facilitating appropriate service recovery to satisfy customers after a failure. The results have important implications and suggest some interesting avenues for future research...|$|R
