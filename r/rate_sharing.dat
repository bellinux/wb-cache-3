40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a multiple-input multiple-output broadcast channel with limited feedback where all users share the feedback rates. Firstly, {{we find the}} optimal feedback <b>rate</b> <b>sharing</b> strategy using zero-forcing transmission scheme at the transmitter and random vector quantization at each user. We mathematically prove that equal sharing of sum feedback size among all users is the optimal strategy in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region, while allocating whole feedback size to a single user is the optimal strategy in the high SNR region. For the mid-SNR region, we propose a simple numerical method to find the optimal feedback <b>rate</b> <b>sharing</b> strategy based on our analysis and show that the equal allocation of sum feedback rate to a partial number of users is the optimal strategy. It is also shown that the proposed simple numerical method can be applicable to finding the optimal feedback <b>rate</b> <b>sharing</b> strategy when different path losses of the users are taken into account. We show that our proposed feedback <b>rate</b> <b>sharing</b> scheme can be extended to the system with stream control and is still useful for the systems with other techniques such as regularized zero-forcing and spherical cap codebook.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a modeling approach for studying fair <b>rate</b> <b>sharing</b> in a CDMA link. Capacity models derived for CDMA indicate that fair <b>rate</b> <b>sharing</b> {{belongs to the}} class of generalized processor sharing (GPS) schemes, as these were defined and studied by J. W. Cohen. From this starting point, we examine the steady-state characteristics of flows in a CDMA link considering multiple classes of non-real-time, or elastic, traffic. These permit us to evaluate the expected transfer times of flows and their blocking probabilities, in loss systems. We study traffic models with Poisson arrivals as well as arrivals from a finite-source population, in an Engset-like manner. Along the way we unveil some interesting properties of the GPS model –partially hidden in Cohen’s work – and extend some of its results. In addition, we revisit insensitivity and truncation properties of the stationary distributions encountered in GPS models, and extend to different access control policies...|$|E

A file {{is split}} into small units called chunks {{that may be}} requested on the various links according to some policy, and received after some random delay. After a start-up time called pre-buffering time, received chunks are played at a fixed speed. There is starvation if the chunk to be played has not yet arrived. We provide lower bounds (fundamental limits) on the starvation probability of any policy. We further propose simple, order-optimal policies that require no feedback. For general delay distributions, we provide tractable upper bounds for the starvation probability of the proposed policies, allowing to select the pre-buffering time appropriately.

40|$|Supporting {{multimedia}} applications is {{one requirement}} driving {{the development of}} a differentiated services Internet. One challenge multimedia application developers face is that streaming audio and video places multiple competing requirements on the underlying transport mechanism. For example, sharing network resources with data applications encourages media applications to use either TCP-friendly rate control mechanisms [1] or TCP itself. Yet a multimedia application’s transport requirements are generally poorly matched to the transport service provided by a single TCP connection. Two areas where this mismatch is particularly evident are: • Bandwidth Sharing Researchers have shown that additive-increase multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) congestion control algorithms approximately realize proportional fair <b>rate</b> <b>sharing</b> of bottleneck links [2], [3]. A consequence of this result is that competing continuous media TCP connections sharing a bottleneck link can receive bandwidth shares that are not well matched to their individual needs, resulting in what receivers may perceive as vastly different service quality. As a simple example, if two independent streams sharing a bottleneck have the same RTT, then both will receive an equal proportion of the available bandwidth. However if one of the two media streams was encoded for transmission at a higher bit rate, a receiver might perceive that this stream suffere...|$|E
40|$|Multicell Joint Processing {{has emerged}} as a new {{paradigm}} of cooperative communications, which aims at pushing the capacity limits of cellular systems by eliminating inter-cell interference. Its operation is based on the concept of Base Station cooperation, which is enabled through wideband error-free low-latency links to a central signal processor. This processor is responsible for jointly encoding or decoding the signals, which are transmitted to or received from the User Terminals of the cellular system. The rationale behind this cooperation is that spatially distributed Base Stations are able to act as multiple antennas of a single universal transceiver, which servers the entire cellular system. In this context, the objective is to determine the capacity performance of a multicell joint processing system under the limitations imposed by a practical cellular channel. Towards this end, a comprehensive cellular channel model is proposed, which accommodates continuous path loss functions, distributed User Terminals, multiple antennas and correlated flat fading. Focusing on the uplink channel, the per-cell sum-rate capacity is determined using asymptotic analysis and the derived closed-forms are verified through Monte Carlo simulations. The core of the analysis is based on free probability and random matrix theory, which provide the mathematical tools for studying the asymptotic eigenvalue distribution of the channel matrix. Based on this setting, it is observed that multicell processing effectively removes the interference-limited behavior of conventional cellular systems, since increasing the system power always results in higher capacity. The exact sum-rate capacity depends on the total received power across the system, which is determined by the user distribution, the cell density and the path loss. Including multiple antennas at the Base Stations results in a linear capacity scaling, whereas multiple antennas at the User Terminals do not provide a capacity enhancement. Similarly, antenna correlation at the Base Station side degrades the capacity, while correlation at the User Terminal has no effect. Furthermore, the distribution of the sum-rate capacity across individual User Terminal rates is investigated in terms of fairness. It is observed that by first decoding strong-channel User Terminals, rate fairness is promoted, but equal <b>rate</b> <b>sharing</b> can only be achieved by employing power control in parallel with heuristic user ordering. Focusing on the downlink channel, the per-cell sum-rate capacity is evaluated using duality principles and the individual user rates are calculated considering channel-dependent and random encoding orders. More specifically, three types of power allocations are considered: a) optimal power allocation with system power constraint as an upper bound, b) optimal power allocation with the more appropriate per-cell power constraint and c) uniform power allocation in the dual uplink domain. In this context, it is shown that the upper bound calculated considering a system power constraint is tight for the considered range of cellular parameters and it can be utilized to closely estimate the realistic downlink capacity of a per-cell power constrained system. Furthermore, the downlink user rate vectors are greatly affected by the employed encoding order. More specifically, by considering a user ordering which favours the deep-fade User Terminals, the fairness over the downlink rates can be promoted, while uniform power allocation favours user rate fairness on the expense of the sum-rate capacity...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Com. (Business Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Business {{management}} is characterised by fast and ever–expanding development. Culture and generation play {{an increasingly important}} role in the management of businesses worldwide. Although studies have been conducted on the subjects of culture and generation, little {{attention has been paid to}} culture and generation as a combination of diversity characteristics. As more managers are realising the challenges that arise when managing diverse work environments, the modern manager must question old assumptions about how diverse people work together. In this modern age, it is important to understand diversity issues on all levels of management. Networks are based on people's backgrounds, and understanding the link between networking and diversity is becoming increasingly important. In a culturally complex country such as South Africa, experiencing the impact of diversity on a daily basis can be anticipated. Culture and generation are two terms that encompass all dimensions of diversity. This study investigates the different networking practices found among diverse cultural and generational groups at a Gauteng mine. The generational classification used in this study is based on the fact that generations differ from country to country; therefore, the classification used in this study is relevant to South African generations. Seven hypotheses were formulated pertaining to differences among cultural and generational groups with regard to networking practices. Furthermore, four cultural–generational groups were identified, namely Black Generation X'ers, Black Baby Boomers, White Generation X'ers and White Baby Boomers. Data was collected from Kusasalethu mine employees. The original sample frame comprised 3630 employees from which a sample was chosen that complied with the criteria for culture, age / generation and education. A total of 1046 employees remained from which the sample elements were chosen by making use of probability, systematic proportionate stratified sampling. Self–completion questionnaires were used for collecting the data. A total of 289 questionnaires were completed which constituted a 100 % response rate. The questionnaire used was intended to obtain feedback from respondents regarding their cultural and generational diversity, as well as preferences pertaining to their networking practices. The results from the survey were used to determine the differences between diverse cultures and generations with regards to networking practices. The findings, supported by the rejection of the first null–hypothesis, indicated that there are indeed a number of salient differences between Black Generation X'ers, Black Baby Boomers, White Generation X'ers and White Baby Boomers. Specifically, the results indicated that White Baby Boomers incline to rarely use the medium of SMS when networking while this group also makes use of telephones when networking more often than Black Generation X'ers. Furthermore, Black Baby Boomers more frequently use e–mails when networking while Black Generation X'ers indicated that they rarely use e–mail as network medium. It was found that White Baby Boomers make use of one–on–one face–to–face methods more often when networking than Black Generation X'ers and White Generation X'ers. The largest number of differences was between Black Generation X'ers and White Baby Boomers. The respondents all indicated that they incline to value good relationships at work highly, that they agree that informal work environments are conducive to more effective networking practices, that they frequently have good influences on their families and that they network more during spare time than at work. The results also indicated that the mediums that are used most often when networking include the cell phone and one–on–one face–to–face methods. Respondents tended to <b>rate</b> <b>sharing</b> experiences and exchanging work ideas as very important aims for networking. By dividing diverse workforces into smaller, more manageable units or homogeneous groups, diversity management can be simplified. This is an ability for which managers can be trained and which should be applied correctly within a business environment. In view of the results, it is recommended that managers of diverse workforces should identify different generations and cultures as a way to manage them more effectively. Furthermore, managers should ensure that work environments that are conducive to good relationship building and informality need to be created. Additionally, conflict between Black Generation X'ers and White Baby Boomers should be handled cautiously with a view to ensure that effective solutions are achieved to such conflicts. Preferences with regard to network mediums should be noted, as such awareness may lead to more effective networking / communication within businesses. Management's approach to meetings needs to be reviewed for each group, because differences exist in terms of preferences in this regard. A working environment conducive to exchanging ideas and experiences should be created. Lastly, as all groups value good relationships at work, a climate that encourages openness and conflict resolution should be created. Master...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} maximizing perfor- mance in multihop wireless networks while achieving fairness among flows. While time-based fairness has been widely rec- ognized as the appropriate fairness mechanism in single-hop wireless networks, no analogous notion has been developed for multihop wireless networks. We define the first general notion of time-based fairness for multihop networks by abstracting a net- work into a virtual single-hop network and applying the single- hop time-based fairness notion. This produces <b>rate</b> <b>shares</b> for each flow in the network, and we develop a constructive method for achieving these <b>rate</b> <b>shares</b> through physical-interference- aware scheduling.

To our best knowledge, {{this is the first}} constructive approach for achieving fair <b>rate</b> <b>shares</b> in multihop wireless networks with or without interference consideration. We also prove that, with an appropriate scheduling algorithm, this approach produces an aggregate rate that is within a constant factor of the maximum aggregate rate subject to time-based fairness. Finally, we perform extensive simulations, which show that our approach as much as doubles the aggregate rate of a solution that approximates max- min fairness, while achieving a more natural fairness property...|$|R

40|$|The {{transmission}} control protocol (TCP) is the major trans- port layer protocol in the Internet today. TCP and its vari- ants have the drawback of not knowing the explicit <b>rate</b> <b>share</b> of flows at bottleneck links. The Rate Control Proto- col (RCP) is a major clean slate congestion control protocol which has been recently proposed to address these draw- backs. RCP tries to get explicit knowledge of flow shares at bottleneck links. However, RCP under or over estimates the number of active flows which it needs to obtain the flow fair <b>rate</b> <b>share.</b> This causes under or over utilization of bot- tleneck link capacity. This in turn can result in very high queue length and packet drops which translate into a high average file completion time (AFCT). In this paper we present the design and analysis of a Network congestion Control Protocol (NCP). NCP can give flows their fair <b>share</b> <b>rates</b> and hence resulting in the minimum AFCT. Unlike RCP, NCP can also use accurate formula to calculate the number of flows sharing a network link. This enables NCP to assign fair <b>share</b> <b>rates</b> to flows without over or under-utilization of bottleneck link capacities. Simula- tion results confirm the design goals of NCP in achieving minimum AFCT when compared with RCP. unpublishednot peer reviewe...|$|R
