The main categories of PAs identified were: professional demeanour, critical reasoning and communication. The University of South Africa was selected as the ODL institution and data were collected through individual interviews with auditing lecturers and a focus group discussion with auditing students.

The study also evaluated whether Chartered Accountants (South Africa), who are not allowed to perform audits, do in fact qualify to perform independent reviews. The respondents confirm the need for a principle-based stand-alone set of independent review standards as this is likely to clarify the terminology and to enhance the quality of reviews. The study also reveals that Chartered Accountants (South Africa) meet the requirements to perform independent reviews.

40|$|The {{reality and}} {{perception}} of auditor independence {{is fundamental to}} public confidence in financial reporting. A new Independence Standards Board {{was set up in}} the U. S. in 1997 and the European Union (EU) is currently seeking to establish a common core of independence principles. The general setting within which audit decisions are made and independence perceptions are formed is evolving rapidly due to competitive and regulatory changes. Policy-makers must work continuously to evaluate the critical threat factors and develop appropriate independence principles. This paper explores the potential of recent regulatory reforms in the United Kingdom (U. K.), many of which are unique to that country, to strengthen the independence framework. Using a questionnaire instrument, U. K. interested parties' perceptions of the influence on auditor independence of a large set of 45 economic and regulatory factors are elicited. Most factors {{have a significant impact on}} independence perceptions for all groups (finance directors, audit partners, and financial journalists). The principal threat factors relate to economic dependence and non-audit service provision, while the principal enhancement factors relate to regulatory changes introduced in the early 1990 s (the existence of an audit committee, the risk of referral to the Financial Reporting Review Panel and the risk to the audit firm of loss of <b>Registered</b> <b>Auditor</b> status).

40|$|ISO/IEC 12207 {{training}} {{is a key}} element to provide an ability to software development organizations for selecting a set of required processes, measuring the performance of these processes, and continuously improving them. Traditionally, such {{training is}} either performed by an expert individual to the software quality management personnel most likely in form of a seminar in a classroom environment. This may also be given by a suitability qualified professional, such as a <b>registered</b> <b>auditor.</b> However, software requirements are usually subject to change, and therefore such training is not enough to teach the substantial details of the entire standard. This has led to increased reports of complications, which demotivates organization to use this standard. To improve the quality of training, a 3 D serious game was proposed for the software practitioners. The preliminary idea here is that the game employs 3 D office landscape to provide a realistic virtual environment ensuring that the training will be based on real word like situations. Before building a prototype for our serious game, we consulted five industrial experts whose works are related with ISO standards. To give these practitioners an opportunity to explore the conceptual design and raise some potential problems, the semi-structured interview method was used. Based on the suggestions of experts, dynamics and mechanics of the proposed game were updated. Taken together, initial results suggest that a serious game for teaching ISO/IEC 12207 should be useful for individuals who are interested {{to learn more about the}} standard...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the complex}} {{process through which}} EU's Eighth Company Law Directive on the qualification of statutory auditors (1984) was implemented in Denmark. The Directive envisaged one group of ‘statutory auditors’ in each member state. However, in Denmark there were two groups of auditors: the state authorised auditors who had a long education and high status, and the <b>registered</b> <b>auditors</b> who had a shorter education, lower status and whose clients were mainly medium and small sized businesses. An exemption {{was made in the}} Directive to allow the <b>registered</b> <b>auditors</b> to continue to audit despite {{that they did not have}} the required ‘university level’ education. This made the issue of education central to the long-term survival of the <b>registered</b> <b>auditors</b> and it consequently became the object of a long conflict between the parties with an interest in auditor education and qualifications: the profession, the state and the educational institutions. This case illustrates the processes of audit regulation in a small European state with a highly developed economy where auditors are approved and regulated by the state but through processes heavily influenced by the profession. It provides an interesting contrast to other studies carried out on the implementation of this Directive, e. g. in the UK (Cooper et al, 1996) and in Greece (Caramanis, 1999), and perhaps some insight into the difficulties which may be encountered in implementing the new Eighth Directive proposed by the Commission in May 2003.

40|$|The Charities Acts 1992 and 1993 {{introduced}} for {{the first}} time in the UK a general statutory regime for scrutiny of charity accounts (Morgan 1999; Picarda 2001). The legislation requires charities over, 250, 000 income to have their accounts audited by a <b>registered</b> <b>auditor,</b> but this only applies to around 7 % of registered charities (Charity Commission 2004 b). Below this a charity may opt for an independent examination of its accounts. The independent examiner (IE) is undertaking an “audit role”, but is not required to express and opinion as to whether or not the charity’s accounts give a true and fair view. This regime means that many charities can opt for scrutiny of their accounts by individuals drawn from within the charity sector, frequently volunteers, rather than engaging external accountants – it can be seen as a lay audit role function. But although the IE does not give a true and fair opinion, by law the IE must follow a 12 stage process and the IE’s report must address a range of issues, including opinions in up to seven areas. A decade after its introduction, the paper reports on the operation of independent examination, and discusses planned policy developments. A new Charities Bill which is now before Parliament (House of Lords 2004) proposes an increase to £ 500, 000 in the upper income limit for independent examination, but with a requirement that for larger charities within the independent examination range,the IE must hold a relevant professional qualification. So what began as a “lay” role is arguably becoming a semi-professional role. The paper seeks to investigate the effectiveness of the independent examination regime, drawing both on theory and fieldwork, and seeks to consider how it will develop in the light of these proposed changes. The fieldwork spans a seven year period, beginning with a series of qualitative studies of independent examiners, and leading on to a study of 700 registered charities: where these charities met the criteria for independent examination, their accounts were individually inspected and assessed in terms of a range of variables. The main conclusion is that the UK independent examination regime offers a potentially rigorous approach to scrutiny of charity accounts, and even though the IE does not express a true and fair view, the process is much closer to an audit than might be supposed. Based on the limited measures used in this study, the regime appears to be working, and standards have improved considerably since an earlier, smaller study (Morgan 2000). It therefore appears that the case for increasing the threshold is well justified, provide the professional qualification requirement is broad enough to include individuals with a voluntary sector background. </p...|$|E
