5000|$|The Coos Bay Wagon Road Lands (CBWR) were {{originally}} {{granted to the}} Oregon & California Railroad in 1866. They include odd-numbered sections in a six-mile swath between Coos Bay and Roseburg. The grant, which was intended to finance construction of a military road between the two towns, was forfeited by the railroad for violating grant provisions identical to those that caused the revestment of the Oregon and California Railroad Revested Lands (O&C Lands). On February 26, 1919 federal legislation was enacted to <b>reconvey</b> to <b>the</b> United States approximately 73,583 acres of land in Coos and Douglas counties that had been conveyed by the United States to the Coos Bay Wagon Road. Congress enacted the Oregon and California Revested Lands Sustained Yield Management Act of 1937 (...) , directing the Secretary of Interior to manage <b>the</b> <b>reconveyed</b> Coos Bay Wagon Road Lands for permanent forest production under the principle of sustained yield, {{for the purpose of}} providing a permanent source of timber supply, protecting watersheds, regulating stream flow, and contributing to the economic stability of local communities and industries. The act also directed the secretary to provide recreational facilities and establish a formula to pay revenues from forest production on <b>the</b> <b>reconveyed</b> <b>lands</b> to Coos and Douglas counites in lieu of taxes in proportion to the relative assessed value of <b>the</b> <b>reconveyed</b> <b>lands</b> in each county.|$|R

25|$|Richard {{was born}} in Burford, {{near the town of}} Wyche (modern Droitwich, Worcestershire) and was an orphan member of a gentry family. On the death of their parents Richard's elder brother was heir to the estates but he was not old enough to inherit, so <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> were subject to a feudal wardship. On coming of age his brother took {{possession}} of his lands, but was required to pay a medieval form of death duty that left the family so impoverished, that Richard had to work for him on the farm. His brother also made Richard heir to the estate. According to Richard's biographers, friends tried to arrange a match with a certain noble lady. However Richard rejected the proposed match, suggesting that his brother might marry her instead; he also <b>reconveyed</b> <b>the</b> estates back to his brother, preferring a life of study and the church.|$|R

50|$|Rescue artists {{arrange the}} closing (often delaying the date until {{shortly before the}} homeowner's removal to create urgency). At the closing, the homeowner {{transfers}} title (possibly unwittingly) to the rescue artist or an arranged investor. The rescue artist or arranged investor pays off the amount owed in foreclosure to acquire the deed, and inherits or is paid any portion of the homeowner's remaining equity. The rescue artist will <b>reconvey</b> <b>the</b> property back to the homeowner {{in the form of}} a lease or a contract for deed.|$|R
5000|$|... 2-Year Right of Rescission - Generally, a {{violation}} of the contractual requirements or any of the prohibited acts in Subdivision 7 makes the conveyance voidable and may be rescinded within 2 years of the date the deed was recorded. The statute then gives the equity purchaser (or its successor) twenty days to <b>reconvey</b> <b>the</b> property on the condition of repayment of any consideration paid to the equity seller. HEPTA does not affect the rights of a bona-fide purchaser or encumbrancer for value if their conveyance occurred before the recording of the notice of rescission.|$|R
50|$|In Anglo-Saxon England, when {{interest}} {{loans were}} illegal, the main method of securing realty was by wadset (ME wedset). A wadset was a loan masked as a {{sale of land}} under right of reversion. The borrower (reverser) conveyed by charter a fee simple estate, in consideration of a loan, to the lender (wadsetter) who on redemption would <b>reconvey</b> <b>the</b> estate to the reverser by a second charter. The difficulty with this arrangement was that the wadsetter was absolute owner of the property and could sell it to a third party or refuse to <b>reconvey</b> it to <b>the</b> reverser, who was also stripped of his principal means of repayment and therefore in a weak position. In later years the practice—especially in Scotland and on the continent—was to execute together the wadset and a separate back-bond according the reverser an in personam right of reverter.|$|R

5000|$|Title I, Escambia County, Florida Formerly the {{original}} [...] Title I would authorize Escambia County in Florida to convey certain property that it {{received from the}} federal government. The specified properties {{had been part of}} the Santa Rosa Island National Monument and were transferred to the county in 1947 for public purposes. As a condition of that conveyance, Escambia County can <b>reconvey</b> <b>the</b> properties to the federal government or to the State of Florida. Title I would remove that condition and add new conditions. First, any conveyance of the specified properties would require the county to convey to Santa Rosa County any of the property that falls within the jurisdictional boundaries of Santa Rosa County. Second, any proceeds above the direct or incidental costs from conveyances would be transferred to the federal government. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that implementing title I would have no significant impact on the federal budget. Based on information provided by the National Park Service (NPS) and local government entities, CBO estimates that the proceeds from any conveyances would be used to cover those costs. [...] Title II, Anchorage, Alaska Formerly [...] Title II would require the Secretary of the Interior to convey the reversionary interest of the United States in three acres of <b>land</b> to <b>the</b> city of Anchorage, Alaska. Under current law, the city holds title to those lands and will retain title as long as <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> are used for public purposes. If the city stops using <b>the</b> <b>lands</b> for such purposes, title would revert to the federal government. [...] Based on information provided by the city of Anchorage, CBO expects that, under current law, the city would continue to use <b>the</b> affected <b>lands</b> for public purposes and hold title to those <b>lands</b> over <b>the</b> next 10 years. Furthermore, under title II, any administrative costs associated with conveying the reversionary interest in those lands would be paid by the city; therefore, CBO estimates that implementing title II would have no effect on the federal budget. [...] Title III, Fernley, NevadaFormerly [...] Title III would direct the Secretary of the Interior to sell up to 9,400 acres of federal <b>land</b> to <b>the</b> city of Fernley, Nevada. Based on information provided by the city, CBO estimates that enacting that provision would increase offsetting receipts, which are treated as reductions in direct spending, by $5 million over the 2014-2024 period.|$|R

He told her she would be found guilty again, to a dead certainty. 'And this time,' he said, 'the public will let the law take its course. Have you got an old friend whom you can trust?' She hadn't such a thing as an old friend in the world. 'Very well, then,' says the lawyer, you must trust me. Sign this paper; and you will have executed a fictitious sale of all your property to myself. When the right time comes, I shall first carefully settle with your husband's executors; and I shall then <b>reconvey</b> <b>the</b> money to you, securing it properly (in case you ever marry again) in your own possession. The Crown, in other transactions of this kind, frequently waives its right of disputing the validity of the sale; and, if the Crown is no harder on you than on other people, when you come out of prison you will have your five thousand pounds to begin the world with again.'

The Bishop Estate had subdivided some of its land on Oahu, and leased individual lots to land lessees who built homes on them, at first paying nominal rents to the estate. But eventually, as Oahu land values rose (as did rents) the tenants demanded that the state acquire the Estate's title and <b>reconvey</b> title to <b>the</b> individual lots to the lessee-homeowners {{who would have to}} pay fair market value to reimburse the State for the acquisition.|$|R
