40|$|AC-DC {{converters}} find {{application in}} every day life as a front-end to DC-DC and DC-AC converters. Active three-phase converters shape the three-phase input current to be sinusoidal and to be in-phase with the input voltage, {{as well as to}} provide a steady DC output voltage. This thesis investigates various active three-phase rectifier and control topologies and identifies a rectifier and control topology most suitable for use in converting a variable voltage variable frequency generator output to a DC voltage. In this dissertation, design relations are derived for determining the plant transfer response (for the suitable topology/controller), design equations are derived for designing/choosing the filter components, and guidelines are derived that will assist in choosing the right semi-conductor components and to give an estimation of expected system efficiency. The dissertation investigates the implementation of both analogue and digital control and provides implementation methodologies for both controllers. Expected results are verified by simulation and a build-up prototype. It was shown that the VIENNA rectifier is able to convert a generator type input, with variable input voltage amplitude and variable frequency, to a constant DC-bus voltage whilst controlling the input current to be sinusoidal and in phase with the input voltage. The rectifier was able to maintain a constant DC voltage at the output for input voltages as low as half the <b>rated</b> <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> and for an equivalent output power of half the rated output power. This suggests that the VIENNA rectifier, controlled as a dual-boost rectifier, is suitable for applications that require power factor corrections and simultaneously operate from a wide input voltage range.

40|$|A simple {{breadboard}} {{power controller}} {{was designed and}} demonstrated for a new liquid-fed water resistojet. The 1 -piece laboratory model thruster has an integrated vaporizer/superheater using a single heating element. Heater temperature was maintained at or near a preset reference value with the closed loop controller providing pulse width modulated (PWM) dc power into the thruster heater. A combined thruster, temperature readout, PWM transfer function was experimentally determined. This transfer function was used to design a proportional plus integral controller that demonstrated zero steady state error, conservative stability margins and adequate transient response to step changes in propellant flow <b>rate,</b> <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> and temperature reference. Initial turn-on temperature overshoot from room temperature to a 650 C setpoint was 80 C. In addition, EMI was alleviated by reducing heater dI/dt and dV/dt using a simple diode-inductor-capacitor network. Based on limited initial tests, thruster preheat with no propellant flow was necessary to achieve stable system operation during startup.

40|$|High-power DC-DC {{converter}} {{will be one}} of {{the essential}} technologies for the future DC grids. Especially, a three-phase dual-active bridge DC-DC (3 DAB) Converter is highly suitable for high-power DC systems. Key component within this converter is the high power transformer operated at a medium frequency (MF) range. The design and optimization of this key component is presented in this paper. The transformer provides galvanic isolation from low voltage level to medium level or high voltage level and provides stepping up or down of the output (secondary) voltage. At first, a design of three-phase medium frequency transformer is developed. The designed transformer is then validated using two-dimensional (2 D) transient finite element analysis (FEA) and performance under the non-sinusoidal excitation is determined. After that, the optimization is carried out, for the set of selected design variables, in order to enhance the power density and efficiency of the targeted transformer. Finally, the performance of the full system, 3 DAB converter, is determined using the parameters of optimized transformer. Also, two different <b>rated</b> <b>input</b> <b>voltages</b> for 4 MW/ 1 kHz three-phase transformer are considered and analysed in this paper...|$|R

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen major changes to the {{appliances}} which comprise the domestic load. Appliances {{which may have been}} considered to be passive loads are now supplied through power electronic front ends. These new loads are known sources of power quality disturbances, predominately harmonic currents. While examinations have been made of the electrical behaviour of first generation electronic appliances, there is little literature dealing with the performance of more modern loads. Understanding the behaviour of modern loads is essential if accurate models of equipment connected to the power system are to be developed. This paper examines the input current characteristics of a number of modern domestic appliances. This includes an analysis under undistorted <b>rated</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>input</b> conditions along with examination of the impact that varying <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> conditions has on appliance input currents. Characterisation of the appliance input current is achieved through a laboratory testing regime using a programmable power source. On the whole, it can be noted that many modern appliances have input current performance which is better in terms of harmonic content compared to older appliances with power electronic front ends. With respect to variation of the <b>input</b> <b>voltage,</b> it has been found that harmonic distortion has a larger impact on the input current of appliances than variations in fundamental voltage magnitude...|$|R

In nature, ozone is formed by the sun's ultraviolet rays and high energy electrical discharges during lightning storms.

Therefore, in this study experimental setup has been conducted to explore the potential possess by the lightning phenomena in generating huge amount of ozone in a repetitive strike. Lightning waveshape (1. 2 / 50 µs) has been developed by single stage impulse voltage generator. This pulse is then applied through the reactor to produce the ozone.

50|$|A successive-approximation ADC uses a {{comparator}} to successively narrow a {{range that}} contains the <b>input</b> <b>voltage.</b> At each successive step, the converter compares the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> to the output of an internal {{digital to analog converter}} which might represent the midpoint of a selected voltage range. At each step in this process, the approximation is stored in a successive approximation register (SAR). For example, consider an <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> of 6.3 V and the initial range is 0 to 16 V. For the first step, the input 6.3 V is compared to 8 V (the midpoint of the 0-16 V range). The comparator reports that the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> is less than 8 V, so the SAR is updated to narrow the range to 0-8 V. For the second step, the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> is compared to 4 V (midpoint of 0-8). The comparator reports the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> is above 4 V, so the SAR is updated to reflect the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> is in the range 4-8 V. For the third step, the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> is compared with 6 V (halfway between 4 V and 8 V); the comparator reports the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> is greater than 6 volts, and search range becomes 6-8 V.

40|$|Abstract—This paper explores a new {{configuration}} for modular dc–dc converters, namely, {{series connection}} at the input, and parallel connection at the output, {{such that the}} converters share the <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> and load current equally. This {{is an important step}} toward realizing a truly modular power system architecture, where low-power, low-voltage, building block modules can be connected in any series/parallel combination at input or at output, to realize any given system specifications. A three-loop control scheme, consisting of a common output voltage loop, individual inner current loops, and individual <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> loops, is proposed to achieve <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> and load current sharing. The output voltage loop provides the basic reference for inner current loops, which is modified by the respective <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> loops. The average of converter <b>input</b> <b>voltages,</b> which is dynamically varying, is chosen as the reference for <b>input</b> <b>voltage</b> loops. This choice of reference eliminates interaction among different control loops.
