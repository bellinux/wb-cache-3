40|$|Abstract: Large {{cities have}} {{experienced}} rapid spatial growth because of higher {{growth rates of}} urban population. Land is an important resource for spatial expansion and accommodating various activities within the <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> of the city. Therefore, there {{is an increase in}} land use change in <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> by the local and planning authorities and they are allowing changes in making streets as commercial streets for socio-economic benefits. Many streets in <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> have altered into commercial, public and semi public activities and apartments. Thus, the <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> are affected greatly in terms of increasing density and overloading the existing infrastructure facilities by changing dynamics of land use. With a result of this, the <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> are transforming into mixed land use. The City of Mysore is a large city and an emerging metropolitan city in the State of Karnataka. Vani Vilasa Mohalla, is a residential neighbourhood it is one among many <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> which was developed before Independence. The neighbourhood is experiencing rapid land use transformation. The paper presents the changing dynamics of land use for emerging mixed land use in a residential neighbourhood of Vani Vilasa Puram, Mysore and proposes planning strategies for mixed land use...|$|R

40|$|The modern urban {{settlement}} system of Belarus and Russia {{is under the}} influence of European social-economic and political transformational processes. This paper presents and discusses some new trends and changes of this development. In Belarus a number of small {{urban settlement}}s and <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> in cities have been built for civil representatives of military contingents which left Central and Eastern European countries. Besides that it was done to take off a tension in housing problem in the Armed forces. These <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> were built with participation of different Byelorussian and foreign building firms and German financing (1, 4 billions DM). It is characterized by high quality of housing, service, engineering and transport infrastructure. Plots of land for <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> location were defined with Institute for Regional and Urban Planning participation according to the master-plans of cities with idea of habitat improving. Planning projects of the districts were made through tenders. Totally seven <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> for civil representatives of military contingents were built in Belarus: in Borisov and Maryina Gorka (Minsk Oblast), in Baranovichi and Beryoza (Brest Oblast), in Lida, Slonim and Ross (Grodno Oblast).
