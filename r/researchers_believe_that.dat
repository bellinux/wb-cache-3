5|$|Most <b>researchers</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> HIV {{originated}} in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century; {{it is now}} a pandemic, with an estimated 38.6million people now living with the disease worldwide. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) estimate that AIDS has killed more than 25million people since it was first recognised on 5 June 1981, {{making it one of the}} most destructive epidemics in recorded history. In 2007 there were 2.7million new HIV infections and 2million HIV-related deaths.|$|E
5|$|In 1997 a {{population}} of P.fluviatile was discovered under the ruins of Trajan's Forum {{in the heart of}} Rome, living in canals built by the Etruscans which connect to the Cloaca Maxima. Based on a genetic analysis, which demonstrated that these crabs were similar to those in Greece, <b>researchers</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> they had been brought by the Greeks before the founding of the city, some 3000 years ago. The crabs' unusual size, up to , and longevity (up to 15years) are also interpreted as evidence of a long-established population, by analogy with island gigantism.|$|E
5|$|<b>Researchers</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{much of the}} low {{northern}} {{plains of}} the planet were covered with an ocean hundreds of meters deep, though this remains controversial. In March 2015, scientists stated that such an ocean {{might have been the}} size of Earth's Arctic Ocean. This finding was derived from the ratio of water to deuterium in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to that ratio on Earth. The amount of Martian deuterium is eight times the amount that exists on Earth, suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from the Curiosity rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in Gale Crater, though not significantly high enough to suggest the former presence of an ocean. Other scientists caution that these results have not been confirmed, and point out that Martian climate models have not yet shown that the planet was warm enough in the past to support bodies of liquid water.|$|E

5|$|Keith (Enrico Colantoni) is {{visited by}} Mindy O’Dell (Jamie Ray Newman), who {{tells him to}} {{investigate}} Dean O’Dell’s (Ed Begley, Jr.) death. Mac (Tina Majorino) is called in for tech support when an animal research lab is raided and a valuable monkey is stolen, and Mac asks Veronica for help. The <b>researchers</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> a PETA-like organization, named PHAT, is responsible. At the PHAT meeting, Mac flirts with the group leader, Bronson, {{but there is no}} reason to think that they’re guilty. Weevil invites Keith to investigate Dean O’Dell’s office, and he finds a 40-year-old bottle of scotch unopened. At the next PHAT meeting, Veronica is asked to take action for animal rights in any way she sees fit. Keith presents the bottle of scotch as evidence of a murder of Dean O’Dell. Back at the lab, Veronica notices a coworker being mean to the monkey researchers. After a slight hazing ritual, Veronica and Mac are accepted into the group. In order to impress the leader of the group, Veronica, Mac, and Parker (Julie Gonzalo) participate in a party.|$|E

25|$|Mary Edison {{died at age}} 29 on August 9, 1884, {{of unknown}} causes: {{possibly}} from a brain tumor or a morphine overdose.

25|$|Microbes require copper-containing enzymes {{to drive}} certain vital {{chemical}} reactions. Excess copper, however, can affect proteins and enzymes in microbes, thereby inhibiting their activities. <b>Researchers</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> excess copper {{has the potential}} to disrupt cell function both inside cells and in the interstitial spaces between cells, probably acting on the cells' outer envelope.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there is}} little {{evidence}} of abnormality in serotonin neurotransmission, the limited efficacy of medications which affect serotonin levels may indicate the role of this pathway.

25|$|Researchers do {{not agree}} about how long episodic {{memories}} are stored in the hippocampus. Some <b>researchers</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> episodic memories always rely on the hippocampus. Others believe the hippocampus only stores episodic memories for a short time, after which the memories are consolidated to the neocortex. The latter view is strengthened by recent evidence that neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus may ease the removal of old memories and increase the efficiency of forming new memories.|$|E

25|$|A {{study on}} {{examining}} sexual messages in popular TV shows found that 2 out of 3 programs contained sexually related actions. 1 out of 15 shows included scenes {{of sexual intercourse}} itself. Shows featured a variety of sexual messages, including characters talking about when they wanted to have sex {{and how to use}} sex to keep a relationship alive.

25|$|Some <b>researchers</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> {{combination}} therapies that simultaneously block multiple pathways {{may improve}} efficacy {{by making it}} more difficult for the tumor cells to mutate before being destroyed. In October 2012 a study reported that combining Dabrafenib with a MEK inhibitor trametinib led to even better outcomes. Compared to Dabrafenib alone, progression-free survival was increased to 41% from 9%, and the median progression-free survival increased to 9.4 months versus 5.8 months. Some side effects were, however, increased in the combined study.|$|E
25|$|Research {{in writing}} {{development}} has been limited in psychology.

Spoken and written skills could be considered linked. <b>Researchers</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> children's spoken language influences their written language. When a child learns to write they need to master letter formation, spelling, punctuation and they also have to gain an understanding of the structure and the organisational patterns involved in written language.|$|E
