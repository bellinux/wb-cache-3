5000|$|A very {{successful}} August 1925 product, called the [...] "Socket Power Battery Eliminator", was a <b>rectifier</b> <b>unit</b> that allowed users to operate their battery-powered radios from standard light or wall sockets.

The unit needs to be rated at the correct kilovolt-ampere (kVA) to supply the necessary current to the oscillator. Early rectifier systems featured valve rectifiers such as GXU4 (high power high voltage half wave rectifier) but these were ultimately superseded by high voltage solid state rectifiers.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the {{overhead}} wires were re-energised at 25,000 V alternating current (AC) (and 6,250 V AC in the London area) and the trains were rebuilt to operate using this very different electrical system. This entailed the fitting of {{a transformer and}} <b>rectifier</b> <b>unit,</b> which were located on the underframe between the bogies of the intermediate carriage. At {{the same time the}} location of the pantograph was moved to this carriage as well. Because this reduced the headroom inside the train, the guards' compartment was relocated to be directly below the pantograph, which was replaced by the more modern Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph design. The trains were then re-numbered 001-092 with the last two digits of each carriage number (previously numbered in the LNER coaching series) the same as the unit number.|$|E

30|$|To have a {{baseline}} result with a fully connected network, we trained a fully connected DNN with 4 hidden layers and 2000 hidden units per layer. The input {{to the network}} consisted of 17 consecutive frames of the 123 FBANK features described earlier. Apart from the softmax output layers, all hidden neurons were ReLUs [16]. In an earlier study, we showed that DNNs of <b>rectifier</b> <b>units</b> can attain the same accuracy as a sigmoid network, but without pre-training [35]. Other authors reached the same conclusions, but using much larger datasets [36 – 38]. Our fully connected ReLU DNN got an error rate of 20.6 % on the TIMIT core test set.|$|R

These locomotives can run under both DC traction and AC traction. All the WCAM locos except the WCAM 1 (made by CLW) {{were made by}} BHEL. They have 750 V DC traction motors, using resistance banks in DC mode and a variable ratio auto-transformer with <b>rectifier</b> <b>units</b> in AC mode, for power control. The WCAM class locomotives were in service only in the Mumbai region. The dual-voltage WCAM series locomotives hauled intercity trains out of Mumbai DC suburban region which was on a 1500 V DC overhead system, as opposed {{to other parts of}} India which have 25000 V AC overhead.|$|R
30|$|An AC system obviates <b>rectifier</b> <b>units</b> of a DC {{system and}} reduces the number of {{elements}} in series, so as to help improving reliability. The AC circuit breaker (switch), compared to the DC breaker, is less expensive and more reliable and durable. Moreover, the segmented power supply technology, the status identification, and the protection technology are well applicable to any complex power supply system and able to improve system’s reliability significantly [11, 17]. NCDs can have their reasonable backup. NCD’s reliability {{is not less than}} that of the MTT in an MSS. Even in the case that all NCDs are out of service {{for a short period of}} time, the MTT can take advantages of its overload ability and continue to provide power supply. In short, the AC system has a higher reliability.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to develop}} a {{functional}} model of symmetrical multi-pulse Auto-Transformer <b>Rectifier</b> <b>Units</b> (ATRUs) for More-Electric Aircraft (MEA) applications. The ATRU {{is seen as the}} most reliable way readily to be applied in the MEA. Interestingly, there is no model of ATRUs suitable for unbalanced or faulty conditions at the moment. This paper is aimed to fill this gap and develop functional models suitable for both balanced and unbalanced conditions. Using the fact that the DC voltage and current are strongly related to the voltage and current vectors at the AC terminals of ATRUs, a functional model has been developed for the asymmetric ATRUs. The developed functional models are validated through simulation and experiment. The efficiency of the developed model is also demonstrated by comparing with corresponding detailed switching models. The developed functional model shows significant improvement of simulation efficiency, especially under balanced conditions...|$|R
40|$|Despite their {{overwhelming}} {{capacity to}} overfit, deep learning architectures tend to generalize relatively well to unseen data, {{allowing them to}} be deployed in practice. However, explaining why {{this is the case}} is still an open area of research. One standing hypothesis that is gaining popularity, e. g. Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997); Keskar et al. (2017), is that the flatness of minima of the loss function found by stochastic gradient based methods results in good generalization. This paper argues that most notions of flatness are problematic for deep models and can not be directly applied to explain generalization. Specifically, when focusing on deep networks with <b>rectifier</b> <b>units,</b> we can exploit the particular geometry of parameter space induced by the inherent symmetries that these architectures exhibit to build equivalent models corresponding to arbitrarily sharper minima. Furthermore, if we allow to reparametrize a function, the geometry of its parameters can change drastically without affecting its generalization properties.

50|$|A {{selenium}} rectifier {{is a type}} of metal rectifier, invented in 1933. They were used in power supplies for electronic equipment, and in high current battery charger applications until they were superseded by silicon diode rectifiers in the late 1960s.

40|$|Methods from convex {{optimization}} {{are widely}} used as building blocks for deep learning algorithms. However, {{the reasons for their}} empirical success are unclear, since modern convolutional networks (convnets), incorporating <b>rectifier</b> <b>units</b> and max-pooling, are neither smooth nor convex. Standard guarantees therefore do not apply. This paper provides the first convergence rates for gradient descent on rectifier convnets. The proof utilizes the particular structure of rectifier networks which consists in binary active/inactive gates applied on top of an underlying linear network. The approach generalizes to max-pooling, dropout and maxout. In other words, to precisely the neural networks that perform best empirically. The key step is to introduce gated games, an extension of convex games with similar convergence properties that capture the gating function of rectifiers. The main result is that rectifier convnets converge to a critical point at a rate controlled by the gated-regret of the units in the network. Corollaries of the main result include: (i) a game-theoretic description of the representations learned by a neural network; (ii) a logarithmic-regret algorithm for training neural nets; and (iii) a formal setting for analyzing conditional computation in neural nets that can be applied to recently developed models of attention.

40|$|In many {{electrical}} applications it {{is indispensable}} {{that the power}} converter can operate as a generating or <b>rectifier</b> <b>unit,</b> and the controller {{must be able to}} handle this bidirectional power flow. An application example is the doubly fed induction machine, where power can flow in both directions through the back-to-back (rectifier+inverter) converter connected to the rotor. Since the aim of the control scheme is to keep the intermediate dc-bus to a constant voltage, the rectifier’s load current can have any sign.

30|$|The DC system {{shares the}} same 35  kV cable for the {{traction}} power supply, three-phase power, and single-phase lighting supply [4, 6] while the AC system uses the separate cables for them. But {{this should not}} add much extra cost. Compared with the DC system, the AC system can save the anti-stray current devices along the metro line, save <b>rectifier</b> <b>units</b> and DC switches at each substation, and save expensive energy storage devices or renewable energy feedback devices. Consequently the metro’s underground equipment can be simplified, thus occupied area is reduced. In terms of integrated automatic control devices [4, 5, 6], both the DC and AC systems have the similar scale and costs. However, the AC system needs to have the NCDs, the cost for an AC–DC–C train is higher than that for a DC–AC train. Generally, one-time costs of an AC system may be close {{to that of a}} DC system, but the MSS installed capacity of an AC traction system is significantly lower than the capacity sum of all individual SSs. Thus power resources and costs of the basic electricity are saved. In an AC system, the renewable energy can be directly used in an efficient way, resulting in further saving of power cost. All of these merits to an AC system are beneficial to the economy and in line with the national policy of energy conservation and emission reduction.|$|R

40|$|As the More-Electric Aircraft (MEA) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major trend of future aircraft, the on-board Electrical Power System (EPS) will see significant increased numbers of Power Electronic Converters (PECs) and motor drive systems. In order to study the behaviour and performance of the EPS in MEA, extensive simulation studies need to be done during the system design process. This in return, gives the need to have computationally efficient and accurate models to reduce the design period. In this thesis, the Dynamic Phasor (DP) is used for modelling EPS in the MEA. The DP technique is a general averaging method and naturally a frequency-domain analysis tool. Compared with other averaging models, which is only efficient under balanced conditions, the DP model maintains efficiency under both balanced and unbalanced conditions. The DP technique has been widely used in modelling the constant, single frequency EPS. In this thesis, the DP technique is extended to modelling time-varying frequency EPS. The application of DP in modelling a multi-generator, multi-frequency system is for the first time, developed in this thesis. The developed theory allows a wider application of the DPs. The developed DP model covers key elements in MEA electrical power systems, including the synchronous generator, control, transmission lines, uncontrolled rectifiers, PWM converters and 18 -pulse autotransformer <b>rectifier</b> <b>units.</b> The DP model library developed based on this thesis allows the flexibility to study various EPS’s by integrating elements from the library. A twin-generator aircraft EPS, which is based on the More Open Electrical Technology (MOET) large aircraft EPS architecture, is used to demonstrate the application of DP models. Comparing the DP model with the ABC model (models in three-phase coordinates) and the DQ 0 model (models in a synchronous dq frame), the efficiency and the accuracy of the DP model are demonstrated under both balanced and unbalanced conditions...|$|R
