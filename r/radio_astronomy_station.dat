40|$|Abstract: To {{operate at}} their maximum sensitivity, radio {{astronomy}} stations require a “radio quiet ” environment, i. e. where the interference {{received by the}} <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> <b>station</b> concerned does not exceed the thresholds necessary for this station to operate at its maximum sensitivity. An instrument to achieve a radio quiet environment concerns regulatory provisions by the relevant national Administration that include specific criteria for the technical parameters of potentially interfering radio stations {{that are necessary to}} obtain these thresholds. In addition, based on these criteria a radio quiet area or zone could be a tool to mitigate the impact of transmitting radio stations while taking into account the specificities for terrestrial, aeronautical and space-based radio stations. A necessary basis for the development of such regulations are globally adopted regulatory provisions a...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Nançay <b>radio</b> <b>astronomy</b> <b>station</b> {{teams are}} {{involved}} in several aspects of the Research and Development (R&D) for radio astronomy detectors and systems: i) Microelectronics: Low Noise Amplifiers (LNA), receiver on chip and system in package. The long-term goal is to provide sub-systems for the future Square Kilometer Array and its Pathfinders. A beamformer chip has been integrated in the FP 6 SKADS dense aperture array technology demonstrator EMBRACE. Wide band SiGe LNAs are developed, beamformers with in-chip control are studied and more complex integrated receivers are designed for the european Aperture Array Verification Programme demonstrator. ii) Digital signal processing: EMBRACE beamforming has been implemented in the digital backend and RFI-mitigation oriented signal processing has been designed for realtime systems, including work for FP 6 SKADS and FP 7 PrepSKA. iii) A study of Phased Array Feeds has started in 2008, in order to study the radio electric properties of PAFs at the focus of large F/D telescopes, such as the Nançay Radio Telescope, {{as well as to}} test PAF systems in collaboration with the SPP/IRFU and LAL/IN 2 P 3 laboratories...|$|E

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} behavior of excess and depleted density regions of the coronal transient accompanying the west limb solar flare of 18 : 21 UT on June 29, 1980, is modeled mathematically {{on the basis of}} SMM-X-ray-polychrometer data, and the results are compared to observations made with the radio spectrograph at Harvard <b>Radio</b> <b>Astronomy</b> <b>Station</b> at Fort Davis and with the NCAR/HAO Mark III K-coronameter at Mauna Loa. Input data for the model include T(max) = about 20 x 10 to the 6 th K, n(max) = about 4 x 10 to the 11 th/cu cm, and an assumed ejection velocity of 200 km/sec. Computations using an improved 2 D nonplane MHD model are carried out for locally open and closed magnetic topologies. The spatially wide, large-amplitude, temporarily steepened MHD wave predicted by the model for both magnetic topologies is shown to agree well with the observations, except that the predicted density enhancement exceeded observed values by at least 50 percent for the closed field and by a factor of 3 for the open field. This discrepancy is seen as an indication that the mass emitting soft X-rays was confined in closed-field regions near the sun during the obervation period...|$|E

They were selected evenly over their entire range of absolute SDSS z-band magnitudes (- 13. 5 to - 24 mag), which were used as a proxy for their stellar masses. Here, a first, global presentation of the observations and basic results is given, their further analysis will be presented in other papers in this series. The galaxies were selected based on their properties, as listed in SDSS DR 5. Comparing this photometry to their total HI masses, we noted that, for a few percent, the SDSS magnitudes appeared severely misunderestimated, as confirmed by our re-measurements for selected objects. Although using the later DR 9 results eliminated this problem in most cases, 384 still required manual photometric source selection.

Very long baseline interferometry {{has been used}} to study the compact structure of seven radio sources at 10709 MHz ([ [...] . ] = 2. 8 cm). The observations, the first of a series, were made on April 28 - May 1, 1972, using the NRAO Mark II recording system. Antennas of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (California), the Harvard <b>Radio</b> <b>Astronomy</b> <b>Station</b> (Texas), and the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (West Virginia) were used to give three baselines that greatly improved the (u,v) -plane coverage compared to the coverage of previously used single baselines. The three baselines had lengths of 119, 84, and 54 x 10 [ [...] . ] [ [...] . ]. The observed sources were 3 C 84, NRAO 150, OJ 287, 4 C 39. 25, 3 C 273, PKS 2134 + 004, and VRO 42. 22. 01 (BL Lac). They were tracked by all three antennas during the time of mutual visibility, giving 8 to 11. 5 hours of continuous coverage. With the maximum baseline of 119 x 10 [ [...] . ] [ [...] . ] and a u-v cell size of 40 x 10 [ [...] . ] [ [...] . ], it is unlikely that we have missed any important structure information in the range 0 [ [...] . ] 0005 to 0 [ [...] . ] 005. Fourier inversion of the observations was impossible because there was no phase calibration, and model fitting procedures were used to interpret the data. For five of the sources (NRAO 150, OJ 287, 4 C 39. 25, 3 C 273, and VRO 42. 22. 01) models were found that fit the observations quite well. For 3 C 84 and PKS 2134 + 004 no simple model could be found, but a rough idea of the source structure was still possible. For most of the sources, interferometric results at other frequencies and resolutions are consistent with the present findings, and a joint interpretation is given. For all the sources except OJ 287 (which looks like a point source at our resolution and was used to calibrate the correlated flux density scale) and possibly NRAO 150, two or more separate components are required to match the observations. Component separations range from 0 [ [...] . ] 0006 to 0 [ [...] . ] 005 and their sizes from [ [...] . ] 0 [ [...] . ] 0003 to 0 [ [...] . ] 002. Components less than 0 [ [...] . ] 002 contribute 0. 85 or more of the total 10. 7 GHz flux density for all the sources.
