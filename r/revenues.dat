Individual income tax <b>revenues</b> increased by 14percent, corporate tax <b>revenues</b> by 50percent, customs and duties by 40percent. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107percent, discretionary domestic spending by 62percent, Medicare spending by 131percent, social security by 51percent, and income security spending by 130percent.

5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and the huge oil <b>revenues</b> it was {{generating}} enriched the economy. Despite these <b>revenues,</b> the military government did little to improve {{the standard of living}} of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil <b>revenues</b> fueled the rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil <b>revenues</b> and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns. It did not develop alternate revenue sources in the economy for economic stability. That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.|$|E
30|$|Overall, these {{findings}} suggest that by negatively and significantly influencing the share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total public <b>revenue,</b> the Internet induces a shift in the total public <b>revenue</b> structure from resource <b>revenue</b> towards non-resource <b>revenue</b> in countries that collect resource <b>revenue.</b> These results are confirmed by the negative effect of the Internet on countries’ resource <b>revenue</b> performance (i.e., their resource <b>revenue</b> share of GDP) and the positive impact of the Internet on countries’ non-resource <b>revenue</b> performance (i.e., their non-resource <b>revenue</b> share of GDP).|$|R

3000|$|... “OILPR” {{represents}} the oil prices (deflated by the US consumer price index). It {{stands for a}} proxy for natural resource prices. We expect a rise in natural resource prices to induce higher resource <b>revenue,</b> to discourage the mobilization of non-resource <b>revenue,</b> and therefore to induce {{a rise in the}} share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total public <b>revenue.</b> In this context, higher oil prices could lead governments, including those in developing countries to be inclined to rely on resource <b>revenue</b> as their major source of public <b>revenue.</b> However, as resource <b>revenue</b> is not a sustainable source of public <b>revenue,</b> governments that aim to reduce their dependence on natural resource <b>revenue</b> could engage in tax reforms, by moving away from resource <b>revenue</b> to non-resource <b>revenue.</b> In such a scenario, higher oil prices could lead in the medium to long term to a lower ratio of resource <b>revenue</b> to non-resource <b>revenue,</b> and hence to a decline in the ratio of resource <b>revenue</b> to total public <b>revenue.</b>|$|R

30|$|We have {{hypothesized}} that the Internet would induce {{a shift in the}} public <b>revenue</b> structure form higher reliance on resource <b>revenue</b> to a higher on non-resource <b>revenue,</b> which reflects a greater extent of change from resource <b>revenue</b> to non-resource <b>revenue.</b> The empirical analysis has been carried out using an unbalanced panel dataset comprising 99 countries, including both developed and developing countries, over 7 sub-periods of non-overlapping 3 -year average data covering the annual period 1995 – 2015. The extent of change from resource <b>revenue</b> to non-resource <b>revenue</b> is measured by the share of resource <b>revenue</b> to total public <b>revenue.</b> The empirical results have been obtained using the two-step system Generalized Methods of Moments (GMM) approach. They suggest that the Internet increases the extent of change in the structure of public <b>revenue,</b> from resource <b>revenue</b> to non-resource <b>revenue.</b> This finding leads {{to the conclusion that the}} Internet allows governments to move away, over the medium term, from the dependence of their public <b>revenue</b> on resource <b>revenue</b> towards non-resource <b>revenue.</b>|$|R
3000|$|... “GDPC” is {{the real}} per capita income. It acts {{as a proxy for}} countries’ overall {{development}} level. On the one hand, we expect that countries with higher development levels would be better equipped, including in terms of skills and institutional sophistication (for example, strong capacity of the tax administration to collect public <b>revenue)</b> to negotiate better contracts with resource-seeking multinationals (MNEs). Thus, advanced economies would be able to collect higher resource <b>revenue</b> than less advanced economies. On the other hand, as resource <b>revenue</b> is not a sustainable source of public <b>revenue,</b> advanced economies would be willing to diversify their public <b>revenue</b> sources, including away from resource <b>revenue</b> to non-resource <b>revenue.</b> In particular, tax administrations in developed countries compared to less advanced economies have the requisite capacity and skills to diversify the sources of their resource <b>revenue,</b> from resource <b>revenue</b> towards non-resource <b>revenue.</b> Therefore, we expect countries with lower development levels to experience a lower extent of the change in the structure of public <b>revenue</b> from resource <b>revenue</b> to non-resource <b>revenue,</b> i.e., a decline in their ratio of resource <b>revenue</b> to non-resource <b>revenue.</b>|$|R

30|$|Summing up, {{on the one}} hand, {{while the}} Internet could exert a {{positive}} impact on resource <b>revenue,</b> it is likely that its negative impact on resource revenue—due to the enhancement of resource companies tax avoidance strategies—would outweigh the positive impact so that the net impact on resource <b>revenue</b> would be negative. At the same time, the Internet would likely influence positively non-resource <b>revenue.</b> We therefore expect that the Internet would lead to a higher impact on non-resource <b>revenue</b> relative to resource <b>revenue,</b> and hence a negative effect on the share of resource <b>revenue</b> in total public <b>revenue.</b> In the light of the potential losses of resource <b>revenue</b> that governments could incur, and given the fact that natural resource <b>revenue</b> is not a sustainable source of public <b>revenue,</b> we expect governments to engage in tax reforms, including by using the Internet, to reduce the dependence of its overall public <b>revenue</b> on resource <b>revenue.</b> Overall, we expect that the higher access to the Internet would lead to a higher extent of change in the structure of public <b>revenue</b> (i.e., a lower resource <b>revenue</b> share of total public <b>revenue),</b> notably through a progressive decline in resource <b>revenue</b> in favour of a rise in non-resource <b>revenue.</b>|$|R

Results are consistent with <b>revenue</b> recognition complexity increasing the probability of <b>revenue</b> restatements, after controlling for other determinants of misreporting <b>revenue.</b> These results are significant both statistically and economically and are robust to a number of different specifications. I also test whether misreporting for complex <b>revenue</b> recognition firms is the result of mistakes or manipulation. My tests provide no evidence consistent with complex <b>revenue</b> recognition being associated with manipulating <b>revenue.</b> However, there is evidence that firms that restate <b>revenue</b> and have more complex <b>revenue</b> recognition are less likely to receive an AAER from the SEC and have less negative restatement announcement returns than firms with less complex <b>revenue</b> recognition, suggesting mistakes are more likely for more complex firms...|$|R
