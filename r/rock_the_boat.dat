500|$|In June 1942, Post editor Ben Hibbs became {{supportive}} of Rockwell's Four Freedoms sketches, and gave Rockwell {{two months to}} complete the works. By October, the Post was worried about Rockwell's progress on the Four Freedoms and sent their art editor to Arlington to evaluate. At that time Rockwell was working on Freedom of Worship, his second painting in the series. Rockwell spent two months (October and most of November 1942) on this work, that {{was inspired by the}} phrase [...] "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience." [...] His Arlington, Vermont, neighbors served as his models: Three months pregnant with her hair upbraided, Rose Hoyt posed as a Catholic with a rosary, even though she was actually Protestant of the Episcopal Church. Other models were a Mrs. Harrington, Rockwell's carpenter Walter Squires, Squire's wife Clara Squires (at the right-hand edge), Winfield Secoy, and Jim Martin (center). His final version relied on other visual clues, including a rosary and a religious book. The work had dark-skinned black worshipers juxtaposed on the edges. This placement did not <b>rock</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> with The Post who had not yet featured blacks prominently on its pages. Rockwell said he made these ethnics palatable by [...] "'furtively' painting the face of the black woman at the top; the man at the bottom, with his fez, was too obviously foreign to offend." [...] The image is commonly enhanced and often darkened in reproduction because it uses a color combination of soft greys, beiges and browns. [...] The paint was applied thinly, which allows the weave of the canvas to contribute to the image.|$|E
2500|$|This {{system of}} {{tradition}} had already shifted dramatically {{by the time}} Julian came to power; gone were the days of massive sacrifices honoring the gods. The communal festivals that involved sacrifice and feasting, which once united communities, now tore them apart—Christian against pagan. [...] Civic leaders did not even have the funds, much less the support, to hold religious festivals. Julian found the financial base that had supported these ventures (sacred temple funds) [...] had been seized by his uncle Constantine to support the Christian Church. [...] In all, Julian’s short reign simply could not shift the feeling of inertia that had swept across the Empire. Christians had denounced sacrifice, stripped temples of their funds, and cut priests and magistrates off from the social prestige and financial benefits accompanying leading pagan positions in the past. [...] Leading politicians and civic leaders had little motivation to <b>rock</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> by reviving pagan festivals. Instead, they chose to adopt the middle ground by having ceremonies and mass entertainment that were religiously neutral.|$|E
