25|$|Risk {{management}} involves {{analyzing the}} market and credit risk that an investment bank or its clients take onto their balance sheet during transactions or trades. Credit risk focuses around capital markets activities, such as syndicated loans, bond issuance, restructuring, and leveraged finance. Market risk conducts review of sales and trading activities utilizing the VaR model and provide hedge-fund solutions to portfolio managers. Other <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> include country risk, operational risk, and counterparty risks {{which may or may}} not exist on a bank to bank basis. Credit risk solutions are key part of capital market transactions, involving debt structuring, exit financing, loan amendment, project finance, leveraged buy-outs, and sometimes portfolio hedging. Front office market risk activities provide service to investors via derivative solutions, portfolio management, portfolio consulting, and risk advisory. Well-known <b>risk</b> <b>groups</b> in JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays engage in revenue-generating activities involving debt structuring, restructuring, syndicated loans, and securitization for clients such as corporates, governments, and hedge funds. J.P.

On this retrospective investigation the volume, dimensions and SUVmax of nodes identified by Glu-urea-Lys-(Ahx) -[68 Ga(HBED-CC) ] (68 Ga-PSMA 11) was evaluated and identified alongside their initial risk profile. Methods All PET/CT images were acquired 60 ± 10 min after intravenous injection of 68 Ga-PSMA- 11 (mean dose 176 MBq). In 44 patients with recurrent prostate cancer and PSA relapse, 96 PSMA-positive lymph nodes were identified. These patients were classified based on their risk profile by the initial diagnosis in either low risk (Gleason Score≤ 6) or high <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> (Gleason Score> 6). Fifty one PSMA-positive lymph nodes from 20 high risk patients and 45 PSMA-positive lymph nodes from 22 low risk prostate cancer patients were identified. Using semi-automated lymph node segmentation software (MeVis, Bremen, GER), the node volume, short and long axis dimensions were measured and compared to the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). By morphologic criteria alone, round nodes {{greater than or equal}} to 10 mmwould be considered positive, meanwhile lymph node with PSMA uptake (SUVmax) more than 2. 0 would be considered PSMA-positive. Results The mean volume of 68 Ga-PSMA-positive nodes in high <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> was 0. 8 ml (range 0. 3 - 38. 0 ml) and 0. 6 ml (range 0. 1 - 7. 8 ml) in the low <b>risk</b> <b>group.</b> The mean short axis diameter in high <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> was 8. 8 mm (range 4. 1 - 36. 0 ml) and 7. 5 ml (range 2. 1 - 22. 0 ml) in the low <b>risk</b> <b>group.</b> High <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> presented mean SUVmax of 17. 5 (range 3. 1 - 102. 4), meanwhile the low <b>risk</b> <b>group′s</b> mean SUVmax was 12. 9 (range 2. 7 - 74. 3). From 51 PSMApositive lymph nodes from the high <b>risk</b> <b>group,</b> 21 lymph nodes (41 %) were positive based on diameter > 10 mm on CT. Meanwhile on the low <b>risk</b> <b>group,</b> only 14 out of 45 PSMA-positive lymph nodes (31 %) were positive based on the morphologic criteria. Based on PSMA 11 -PET/CT, 4 out of 20 patients (20 %) from the high <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> and 10 out of 22 patients (45 %) from the low <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> were upstaged from N 0 to N 1. These patients had PSMA-positive nodal metastases that are smaller than 10 mm and therefore missed by the conventional morphologic criteria. Conclusion 68 Ga-PSMA- 11 PET provides a better assessment of the nodal metastases status in patients with recurrent prostate cancer, especially in the low <b>risk</b> <b>group.</b> Morphological imaging strongly underestimates lymph-node involvement compared to PSMA-molecular staging in both, low- and high-risk group...|$|R

HPV status was the major determinant of survival, followed by smoking history and stage. 64% were HPV+ and all were in the low and intermediate risk group, with all non-smoking HPV+ patients in the low risk group. 82% of the HPV+ patients were alive at three years compared to 57% of the HPV- patients, a 58% reduction {{in the risk of}} death. Locoregional failure is also lower in HPV+, being 14% compared to 35% for HPV-. HPV positivity confers a 50–60% lower risk of disease progression and death, but the use of tobacco is an independently negative prognostic factor. A pooled analysis of HPV+OPC and HPV-OPC patients with disease progression in RTOG trials 0129 and 0522 showed that although less HPV+OPC experienced disease progression (23 v. 40%), the median time to disease progression following treatment was similar (8 months). The majority (65%) of recurrences in both groups occurred within the first year after treatment and were locoregional. HPV+ did not reduce the rate of metastases (about 45% of patients experiencing progression), which are predominantly to the lungs (70%), although some studies have reported a lower rate. with 3-year distant recurrence rates of about 10% for patients treated with primary radiation or chemoradiation.

The IGD <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> showed significantly higher scores than healthy controls in all nine psychiatric symptom dimensions, i. e., somatization, obsession-compulsion, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, paranoid ideation, and psychoticism (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: The IGD <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> showed differential psychopathological manifestations according to DSM- 5 IGD diagnostic criteria. Further studies are needed to evaluate {{the reliability and validity of}} the specific criteria, especially for developing screening instruments...|$|R
40|$|During {{a period}} of 2 years we prospectively studied 116 infants upto 8 weeks of age with sus-pected sepsis. Each infant was {{assessed}} clinically before laboratory evaluation for sepsis. Depend-ing upon impression of sepsis, temperature abnor-mality, micro ESR (mESR), WBC counts and toxic granulations infants were assigned to either high (n = 74) or low (n = 31) <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> for serious bacterial infection (SBI). All infants were kept under observation till the final decision for hpspi-talization was made. Eighty six per cent of cases in high <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> and 26 % of cases in low <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> were hospitalized and treated with antibiotics. SBI was present in 55 % of the high <b>risk</b> <b>group</b> infants compared to one (3 %) in the low <b>risk</b> <b>group.</b> Culture for bacterial infections were positive in 22 (19 %) cases; bacteremia was found in 15 (13 %) infants. None of the variables individually pre-dicted the presence of bacteremia or SBI satisfac-torily. Presence {{of two or more}} criteria out of the three criteria namely impression of sepsis, raised mESR and toxic granulation could identify 93 % of infants with bacteremia and 95 % of those with SBI and excluded 89 % of cases without SBI...|$|R
