Erosion can {{take place in the}} form of rain splash and slope wash. Rain splash occurs when a raindrop impacts the bare soil surface and disperses soil particles to the surrounding area. However, as grey dunes begin to develop, lichens and mosses protect the dune surfaces and dissipate raindrop impacts. Slope wash (overland flow) is particularly evident in sparsely vegetated dune slopes. Slope wash occurs when <b>rainfall</b> <b>infiltration</b> is impeded, which can result in rills and alluvial fans.|$|E

40|$|The {{stochastic}} runoff-runon process models {{the volume}} of infiltration excess runoff from a hillslope via the overland flow path. Spatial variability is represented in the model by the spatial distribution of <b>rainfall</b> and <b>infiltration,</b> and their “correlation scale”, that is, the scale at which the spatial correlation of <b>rainfall</b> and <b>infiltration</b> become negligible. Notably, the process can produce runoff even when the mean rainfall rate {{is less than the}} mean infiltration rate, and it displays a gradual increase in net runoff as the rainfall rate increases. In this paper we present a number of contributions to the analysis of the stochastic runoff-runon process. Firstly we illustrate the suitability of the process by fitting it to experimental data. Next we extend previous asymptotic analyses to include the cases where the mean rainfall rate equals or exceeds the mean infiltration rate, and then use Monte Carlo simulation to explore the range of parameters for which the asymptotic limit gives a good approximation on finite hillslopes. Finally we use this to obtain an equation for the mean net runoff, consistent with our asymptotic results but providing an excellent approximation for finite hillslopes. Our function uses a single parameter to capture spatial variability, and varying this parameter gives us a family of curves which interpolate between known upper and lower bounds for the mean net runoff...|$|R

This paper proposes an integrated <b>rainfall</b> <b>infiltration</b> model based on the Green-Ampt model and the SCS-CN model.

These shallow landslides {{are associated with the}} advance of a wetting front in the unsaturated soil due to <b>rainfall</b> <b>infiltration,</b> which results in an increase in water content and a reduction in the matric suction in the soil. Therefore, this study presents a modified equation of infinite slope stability analysis based on the concept of the saturation depth ratio to analyze the slope stability change associated with the rainfall on a slope. A <b>rainfall</b> <b>infiltration</b> test in unsaturated soil was performed using a column to develop an understanding of the effect of the saturation depth ratio following <b>rainfall</b> <b>infiltration.</b> The results indicated that the <b>rainfall</b> <b>infiltration</b> velocity due to the increase in rainfall in the soil layer was faster when the rainfall intensity increased.

In order to validate the proposed approach, the results of the proposed approach were compared with the landslide inventory using a ROC (receiver operating characteristics) graph. In addition, the results of the proposed approach were compared with the previous approach used: a steady-state hydrological model.

Also, the catchment DEM is utilized to derive the flow direction and flow accumulation maps. The rainfall excess for each cell of the catchment is computed using the Thiessen polygons utilizing the coordinate of cells. Then, an Artificial Neural Network developed to simulate the reaction of catchments for runoff generating during a certain rainfall. Model inputs were defined as two layers: <b>rainfall</b> and <b>infiltration</b> rate, computed by Green and Ampt formula. On the other hand, observed runoff in their outlet has been used as output. The best founded Artificial Neural Network was considered as a trusted model for calculating the runoff of each pixel.
