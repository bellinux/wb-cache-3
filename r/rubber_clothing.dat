60|$|Now Toby {{noticed that}} {{each one of the}} drivers was clad in <b>rubber</b> <b>clothing,</b> and, after {{listening}} for a moment, he learned the cause of their waterproof garments. It was raining very hard, and Toby thought with dismay of the long ride {{that he would have to}} take on the top of the monkeys' cage, with no protection whatever save that afforded by his ordinary clothing.|$|E
60|$|I {{observed}} {{that he wore}} a cotton shirt, originally white, a greenish flannel one over it, but no waistcoat, flannel drawers, and strong linen or duck pants, which also had been white, blue woolen stockings, cowhide boots, and a Kossuth hat.[3] He carried no change of clothing, but, putting on a stout, thick jacket, which he laid aside in the canoe, and seizing a full-sized axe, his gun and ammunition, and a blanket, which would do for a sail or knapsack, if wanted, and strapping on his belt, which contained a large sheath-knife, he walked off at once, ready to be gone all summer. This looked very independent--a few simple and effective tools, and no <b>rubber</b> <b>clothing.</b> He was always the first ready to start in the morning. Instead of carrying a large bundle of his own extra clothing, etc., he brought back the greatcoats of moose tied up in his blanket. I found that his outfit {{was the result of}} a long experience, and in the main hardly to be improved on, unless by washing and an extra shirt. Wanting a button here, he walked off to a place where some Indians had recently encamped, and searched for one, but I believe in vain.|$|E

Such petrochemicals provide useful organic precursors {{for a wide}} range of industries such as plastics, synthetic <b>rubber,</b> synthetic <b>clothing,</b> pharmaceuticals, solvents, lubricants, detergents, adhesives, surface coatings, agrochemicals, artificial colours and flavours. However, the origin of petrochemicals is fossil fuels which are a non-renewable resource currently in the declining phase of use (Hubbert 1956; Mohsen and Nahid 2015).|$|R
50|$|Latex rubber, {{which is}} {{naturally}} translucent, or plastics {{can be made}} into clothing material of any level of transparency. Clear plastic is typically only found in over-garments, such as raincoats. The use of translucent latex <b>rubber</b> for <b>clothing</b> {{can also be found}} in fetish clothing. Some materials become transparent when wet or when extreme light is shone on it, such as by a flashbulb.|$|R

50|$|There are {{a handful}} of {{companies}} around the world which manufacture latex rated as suitable for contact with human skin. These firms supply sheet (in the vast majority) to a larger number of smaller fashion clothing companies. In the past, some marketplaces suffered from de facto monopoly supply conditions, where a sheet supplier could impose restrictive ordering requirements. Only being able to order half-kilometre long batches of sheet in the colour and thickness they wanted, meant that designers and clothing producers often had to co-operate, or face long delays in supplying their customers, if they {{wanted to be in the}} <b>rubber</b> <b>clothing</b> business.|$|E

5000|$|The Fitzroy Tavern {{was named}} after Charles FitzRoy (later Baron Southampton), who first {{developed}} {{the northern part of}} the area in the 18th century. FitzRoy purchased the Manor of Tottenhall and built Fitzroy Square, to which he gave his name; nearby Fitzroy Street also bears his name. The square is the most distinguished of the original architectural features of the district, having been designed in part by Robert Adam. The south-western area was first developed by the Duke of Newcastle who established Oxford Market, now the area around Market Place. By the beginning of the 19th century, this part of London was heavily built upon, severing one of the main routes through it, Marylebone Passage, into the tiny remnant that remains today on Wells Street, opposite what would have been the Tiger public house [...] - [...] now a <b>rubber</b> <b>clothing</b> emporium.|$|E
40|$|Separation of faeces and non-faecal solids: {{a variety}} of solid {{materials}} may enter the toilet in the community ablution block context (toilet paper, newspaper, plastics, <b>rubber,</b> <b>clothing)</b> (see Figure 2), {{some of which may}} require pre-treatment (shredding) or complete removal from the feed stream to the dryer. Extruder separates faeces from other solids by using a ram to pressurise the mixed solids stream, causing faeces to be extruded through holes in the external casing and tramp material to accumulate against the endplate (see Figures 3 and 4). Extruder forms faeces into a geometry which allows for more energy-efficient drying and combustion (see Figure 4 c). The pellets formed must have sufficient structural integrity to remain intact through the downstream processes. Segregated faeces has more predictable rheological and thermal properties than the mixed solids stream – allows for better design of downstream unit operations.
