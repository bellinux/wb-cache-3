Lyon's calculation showed that under certain conditions, the flow of energy between two coupled oscillators is proportional to the difference in the oscillator energies (suggesting a thermal analogy exists in structural-acoustic systems). Smith's calculation showed that a structural mode and a diffuse <b>reverberant</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> attain a state of 'equipartition of energy' as the damping of the mode is reduced (suggesting a state of thermal equilibrium can exist in structural-acoustic systems). The extension of the two oscillator results to more general systems {{is often referred to as}} the modal approach to SEA. [...] While the modal approach provides physical insights into the mechanisms that govern energy flow it involves assumptions that have been the subject of considerable debate over many decades. [...] In recent years, alternative derivations of the SEA equations based on wave approaches have become available. Such derivations form the theoretical foundation behind a number of modern commercial SEA codes and provide a general framework for calculating the parameters in an SEA model. A number of methods also exist for post-processing FE models to obtain estimates of SEA parameters. Lyon mentioned the use of such methods in his initial SEA text book in 1975 but a number of alternative derivations have been presented over the years ...|$|E
40|$|In many single- and {{multi-channel}} speech dereverberation methods {{an estimate}} of the late reverberant spectral variance (LRSV) is required. Contrary to LRSV estimators based on room acoustical properties, such as reverberation time, or based on isotropic models of the <b>reverberant</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field,</b> in this paper we propose to use acoustic channel equalization with estimated room impulse responses (RIRs) for LRSV estimation. Unlike the typical application of acoustic channel equalization, where the objective is to estimate the anechoic or the early reverberant speech component, here the late reverberant part of the estimated RIR is set as the target response. The combination of the proposed LRSV estimator with a beamformer and a spectral gain aims at a tradeoff between the performance of acoustic channel equalization and the robustness of methods based on models of the <b>reverberant</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field.</b> The performance, evaluated for different levels of RIR estimation error, is compared to the results obtained using a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the LRSV, based on an isotropic model of the <b>reverberant</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field,</b> and to a state-of-the-art acoustic channel equalization method.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{problem of}} {{predicting}} the {{sound pressure level}} distribution inside a large acoustic space due {{to one or more}} sound sources is examined using a development of Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA). The resulting model may be applied to predict the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> inside an industrial workroom. The prediction method is based on a separate treatment of the direct and <b>reverberant</b> <b>sound</b> <b>fields.</b> The direct <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> is dealt with by assuming free-field propagation, with the application of corrections such as barrier theory as required. The reverberant field is analysed using the SEA framework with the power input corrected for energy lost at the first reflection. The total sound pressure level at any receiver point is given as the sum of the direct and reverberant fields. Measurements made in a workroom using experimental SEA methods, with the acoustic space considered as being divided into three distinct subsystems, demonstrated that the presence of a direct field can also significantly affect the experimental SEA procedure. Comparing measured and theoretically predicted SEA parameters, it is found that the coupling loss factors are in good agreement, but the damping loss factors estimated from published absorption coefficients for the surfaces and fittings agreed less well with the measured data...|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} absorption coefficient {{is a number}} that indicates which fraction of the incident acoustic power impinging on a surface is being absorbed. The incident acoustic power is obtained by spatial integration of the incident intensity, which is (classically) defined as the time-averaged intensity associated with the incident <b>sound</b> <b>field.</b> The measurement of the effective, in situ, sound absorption coefficient is problematic as the determination thus requires a decomposition of the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> in an incident and reflected field which, generally, {{is virtually impossible to}} do.

This coefficient is based on an alternative definition of the incident intensity; the time average of the positive values of the instantaneous intensity. The alternative coefficient is much easier to use in a sense that it follows directly from an in situ, instantaneous intensity measurement. The coefficient does not rely on any assumptions other than the assumption that the linearized wave equation is satisfied (and thus the acoustic energy corollary). As a result, one does not need to decompose the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> in incident and reflected waves. Hence, one does not need to have prior information about the incident <b>sound</b> <b>field.</b> Accordingly, one does not need to have prior information about the source.

40|$|Abstract—Reverberation {{in rooms}} is often {{simulated}} {{with the image}} method due to Allen and Berkley (1979). This method has an asymptotic complexity that is cubic {{in terms of the}} simulated reverberation length. When employed in the frequency domain, it is relatively computationally expensive if there are many receivers in the room or if the source or receiver positions are changing with time. The computational complexity of the image method is due to the repeated summation of the fields generated by a large number of image sources. In this paper, a fast method to perform such summations is presented. The method is based on multipole expansion of the monopole source potential. For offline computation of the room transfer function for image sources and receiver points, use of the Allen–Berkley algorithm requires @ A operations, whereas use of the proposed method requires only @ C A operations, resulting in significantly faster computation of <b>reverberant</b> <b>sound</b> <b>fields.</b> The proposed method also has a considerable speed advantage in situations where the room transfer function must be rapidly updated online in response to source/receiver location changes.

40|$|The {{significance}} of diffusion control in room acoustics {{is that it}} attempts to avoid echoes by dispersing reflections while removing less valuable sound energy. Some applications place emphasis on the enhancement of late reflections to promote a sense of envelopment, and on methods required to measure the performance of diffusers.

The objective of this research is to characterize the audibility of the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> with diffusion in architectural space. In order to address this objective, an approach utilizing various methods and new techniques relevant to room acoustics standards was applied. An array of microphones based on beam forming (i. e., an Acoustic Camera) was utilized for field measurements in a recording studio, classrooms, auditoriums, concert halls and sport arenas. Given the ability to combine a visual image with acoustical data, the impulse responses measured were analyzed to identify the impact of diffusive surfaces on the early, late, and <b>reverberant</b> <b>sound</b> <b>fields.</b> The effects of the room geometry and the proportions of the diffusive surfaces were observed by utilizing computer simulations. The diffuseness in each space was measured by coherences from different measurement positions along with the acoustical conditions predicted by objective parameters such as T 30, EDT, C 80, and C 50. Noticeable differences of the auditory experience were investigated by utilizing computer-based survey techniques, given the current software auralization capabilities. The results based on statistical analysis demonstrate the users’ ability to localize the sound, and to distinguish the intensity, clarity, and reverberation created within the virtual environment. The impact of architectural elements in diffusion control is evaluated by the design variable interaction, objectively and subjectively. The effectiveness of the diffusive surfaces is determined by the echo reduction and the sense of complete immersion in a given room acoustics volume. The application of such methodology at various stages of design provides the ability to create a better auditory experience by the users.

40|$|Abstract—The {{ability of}} the human {{auditory}} system for sound localization mainly depends on the binaural cues, especially interaural time and level differences (ITD and ILD). In the context of digital hearing aids and binaural audio transmission systems, these cues can be severely degraded by independent bilateral signal processing such as dereverberation or noise reduction. This contribution presents a novel two-stage binaural dereverberation algorithm which explicitly preserves the binaural cues. The first stage {{is based on a}} statistical model of the room impulse responses (RIR) and comprises a spectral subtraction rule which reduces late reverberation only. It includes a smoothing process of the spectral gains to reduce musical tones. In a second stage, the residual reverberation is attenuated by a dual-channel Wiener filter. This is derived from a coherence model of the <b>reverberant</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> taking into account shadowing effects of the head. The overall binaural-input binaural-output structure efficiently reduces both early and late reverberation. In experiments as well as informal listening tests using measured binaural room impulse responses, the proposed algorithm significantly improves speech quality according to objective and subjective measures.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{validity}} of the Fick’s law of diffusion in room acoustics is investigated in the stationary state. The Fick’s law, underlying the room-acoustics diffusion model, assumes a propor- tionality relationship between the local sound intensity and the energy density gradient, the propor- tionality constant being the so-called diffusion coefficient. This relationship, based on an analogy with the behavior of real particles in a scattering medium, is assessed by using a numerical tool simulating the actual dynamics of sound particles in a room. Two types of room geometries are considered: rooms with proportionate dimensions and long rooms. Concerning proportionate rooms the numerical analysis highlights the presence of weak variations of the reverberant energy density, generating an intensity vector pattern which is shown to be correctly described by the theoretical Fick’s law and homogeneous diffusion. Conversely, inside long rooms, an estimate of the local value of the diffusion coefficient is carried out, showing that the <b>reverberant</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> is well described by a spatially varying diffusion coefficient (non-homogeneous diffusion).

The results of the listening tests clarified that (1) the universally acceptable ranges of speech level are from 60 to 70 dBA, from 56 to 61 dBA, from 52 to 67 dBA and from 58 to 63 dBA for the test <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> with the reverberation times of 0. 0, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 s, respectively, and (2) there is a speech level that falls within all of the universally acceptable ranges of speech level obtained in the present study; that speech level is around 60 dBA...|$|R
40|$|Acoustical {{measurements}} {{were conducted in}} two ancient theatres–one Greek and one Roman–the origin of modern opera houses and drama theatres. The Delphi theatre (Greece) {{does not have a}} stage building, while the Taormina theatre (Italy) has a partially remaining stage building behind the orchestra. The effect of the stage building on the <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> was determined in terms of the temporal and spatial factors of the <b>sound</b> <b>field.</b> It was found that the stage building affects and the magnitude of the interaural cross-correlation function (IACC). In addition to the reflection from the orchestra floor and the stage tower, scattered and <b>reverberant</b> <b>sound</b> from the audience area were observed. 1...|$|R
