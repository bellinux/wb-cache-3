The communication revolution initiated through INSAT of satellites are now providing climatic and meteorological information over the India enabling scientists to provide more accurate weather forecasting which is very essential for disaster prone arid regions. Subsequently, the satellite <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> data generated by IRS- 1 B LISS-II and IRS- 1 C LISS-III series of satellites has been assisting to promote sustainable resource development strategies at the micro-levels Such initiatives are based on continuous environmental monitoring of land and water resources including meteorological parameters using space informatic technology...|$|R

40|$|With {{the launch}} of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in December 1999, a new era in hyperspectral {{satellite}} <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> began. MODIS makes possible continuous monitoring of the environment by measuring atmospheric trace gases and aerosol density, and mapping the surface of clouds, land and sea in a variety of spectral ranges from the blue to the thermal infra-red.

This paper describes the approaches and planned techniques for validation of geometric parameters. • Product format verification • Timing • SWST • Localisation accuracy • Geocoding parameters • Radiometric resampling effects • Consistency of the products • Inter-channel co-registration • Azimuth and ranging parameter • Orbit analysis • Optimisation • Temporal consistency The tests will be carried out in test areas, covering the four quadrants of the geographic co-ordinate system. Maps, ground control points, corner reflectors, digital elevation models and other <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> sources will be used for the geometric calibration. In addition, the standard ESA products will be compared with geocoded products generated from the project partners with their own software. The high-resolution image mode will first be tested, with the medium resolution and global monitoring mode following in the second calibration period. The orbit parameter accuracy can be verified by interferometric measurements. Given two sufficiently similar SAR images and a reference DEM we can use the speckle and phase information for timing parameter and orbit accuracy verification.

40|$|The Vatnajökull is Europe's largest glacier with {{an area of}} 8300 km² and an {{ice sheet}} up to 1000 m thick. Iceland has many {{periodically}} active volcanoes {{most of which are}} coverded by ice. The latest eruption took place between September 29 and October 13, followed by a flooding on November 5 and 6, 1996. A fissure was formed having a total length of appr. 11 km. It is surrounded by the Bárðarbunga, Hamarinn and Grímsvötn volcanoes. Due to the remote location of the eruption and bad weather conditions only a limited observation from ground or by plane was possible. ERS- 2 - and later on ERS- 1 and ERS- 2 - gave the unique capability to supplement the lack of information. The German <b>Remote</b> <b>Sensing</b> Data <b>Centre</b> acquired, processed and further analyzed the ERS data in {{a very short period of}} time and made the information available to Icelandic partners via internet.

Both amplitude and phase information were utilized to achieve the interpretation results. As the data were precisely orthorectified a quantitative analysis could be performed to estimate the dimensions of the fissure and the amount of melting water.
