The most developed resist-dyeing skills {{are to be found in}} Nigeria where the Yoruba make adire cloths. Two methods of <b>resist</b> are used: adire eleso which involves tied and stitched designs and adire eleko that uses starch paste. The paste is most often made from cassava starch, rice, and other ingredients boiled together to produce a smooth thick paste. The Yoruba of West Africa use cassava paste as a <b>resist</b> while the Soninke and Wolof people in Senegal uses rice paste. The Bamana people of Mali use mud as a <b>resist.</b>|$|E

Technology does not qualitatively restructure the TSN and therefore will not be <b>resisted</b> and never has been <b>resisted.</b> Middle management <b>resists</b> business process reengineering because BPR represents a direct assault on the support net (coordinative hierarchy) they thrive on. Teamwork and multi-functionality is <b>resisted</b> by those whose TSN provides the comfort of narrow specialization and command-driven work." ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} an {{experimental}} {{evaluation of the}} characteristics of the Diazo-type <b>resists</b> (AZ 1450 J, Kodak 820) under x-ray illumination. The goal is the application of these <b>resists</b> in submicron device fabrication (0. 5 micrometers) and also in x-ray mask making. The decisive parameter is, therefore, the resolution which should be better than 0. 1 micrometers. The sensitivity can be rather moderate, if the high-intensity synchrotron radiation is being used. The investigations showed that the structure definition is efficient for 0. 5 micrometers feature size in case of both <b>resists.</b> In contrast to the PMMA-like <b>resists,</b> the Diazo-type <b>resists</b> show a very strong interdependence between resolution and sensitivity.

To ensure safety against seismic forces of multi-storied building hence, there is need to study of seismic analysis to design earthquake resistance structures. In seismic analysis the response reduction was considered for two cases both Ordinary moment <b>resisting</b> frame and Special moment <b>resisting</b> frame. The main objective {{this paper is to}} study the seismic analysis of structure for static and dynamic analysis in ordinary moment <b>resisting</b> frame and special moment <b>resisting</b> frame. Equivalent static analysis and response spectrum analysis are the methods used in structural seismic analysis. We considered the residential building of G+ 15 storied structure for the seismic analysis and it is located in zone II. The total structure was analyzed by computer with using STAAD. PRO software. We observed the response reduction of cases ordinary moment <b>resisting</b> frame and special moment <b>resisting</b> frame values with deflection diagrams in static and dynamic analysis.

50|$|Second, {{all have}} some sort of {{mechanism}} that applies a torque (internal to the differential) that <b>resists</b> the relative motion of the output shafts. In simple terms, this means they have some mechanism which <b>resists</b> a speed difference between the outputs, by creating a <b>resisting</b> torque between either the two outputs, or the outputs and the differential housing. There are many mechanisms used to create this <b>resisting</b> torque. The type of limited-slip differential typically gets its name from the design of this <b>resisting</b> mechanism. Examples include viscous and clutch-based LSDs. The amount of limiting torque provided by these mechanisms varies by design and is discussed later in the article.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of <b>resisted</b> movement training on sprinting and jumping performance. J Strength Cond Res 26 (1) : 299 – 306, 2012 —Resisted movement training {{is that in}} which the sports movement is performed with added re- sistance. To date, the effectiveness on enhancing sprint speed or vertical jump height had not been reviewed. The objectives of this review were to collate information on <b>resisted</b> training studies for sprinting and vertical jumping, ascertain whether <b>resisted</b> movement training was superior to normal unresisted movement training, and identify areas for future research. The review was based on peer-reviewed journal articles identified from electronic literature searches using MEDLINE and SPORTDiscus data bases from 1970 to 2010. <b>Resisted</b> sprint training was found to increase sprint speed but, in most cases, was no more effective than normal sprint training. There was some evidence that <b>resisted</b> sprint training was superior in increasing speed in the initial acceleration phase of sprinting. <b>Resisted</b> jump training {{in the form of}} weighted jump squats was shown to increase vertical jump height, but it was no more effective than plyometric depth jump training. Direct compar- isons between <b>resisted</b> jump training and unresisted normal jump training were limited, but loaded eccentric countermove- ment jump squat training with unloaded concentric phase and eccentric landing was shown to generate superior results for elite jumpers. More prospective studies on <b>resisted</b> sprint training are required along with monitoring both kinematic and kinetic adaptations to fully determine any underlying mecha- nisms for any improvements in sprint speed. Based on the available data, the benefits and superiority of <b>resisted</b> sprint training have not been fully established. As for <b>resisted</b> jump training, although there are some promising findings, these results need to be duplicated by other researchers before <b>resisted</b> jump training can be claimed to be more effective than other forms of jump training...|$|R
