2500|$|Some ranking Jacobites {{made their}} way to , where Charles Edward Stuart had first landed {{at the outset of the}} {{campaign}} in 1745. Here on 30 April they were met by the two French frigates – the Mars and Bellone. Two days later the French warships were spotted and attacked by the smaller Royal Navy sloops – the Greyhound, Baltimore, and Terror. The result was the last real battle in the campaign. During the six hours in which the ferocious sea-battle raged the Jacobites <b>recovered</b> <b>cargo</b> on the beach which had been landed by the French ships. In all £35,000 of gold was recovered along with supplies. Invigorated by the vast amounts of loot and visible proof that the French had not deserted them, the group of Highland chiefs decided to prolong the campaign. On 8 May, nearby at Murlaggan, Lochiel, Lochgarry, Clanranald and Barisdale all agreed to rendezvous at Invermallie on 18 May. The plan was that there they would be joined by what remained of Keppoch's men and Cluny Macpherson's regiment (which did not take part in the battle at Culloden). However, things did not go as planned. After about a month of relative inactivity, Cumberland moved his regulars into the Highlands. On 17 May three battalions of regulars and eight Highland companies reoccupied Fort Augustus. The same day the Macphersons surrendered. On the day of the planned rendezvous, Clanranald never appeared and Lochgarry and Barisdale only showed up with about 300 combined (most of whom immediately dispersed in search of food). Lochiel, who commanded possibly the strongest Jacobite unit at Culloden, was only able to muster about 300. The following morning Lochiel was alerted that a body of Highlanders was approaching. Assuming they were Barisdale's Macdonalds, Locheil waited until they were identified as Loudoun's by the [...] "red crosses in their bonnets". Locheil's men dispersed without fighting. The following week the Government launched punitive expeditions into the Highlands which continued throughout the summer.|$|E

50|$|In 1936, Craig {{traveled}} to Great Britain and Ireland {{to prepare for}} underwater filming {{of an attempt to}} <b>recover</b> <b>cargo</b> (including possible gold bullion) that had gone down with the RMS Lusitania when it was sunk near the Irish coast in 1915. In 1935, a single British diver had managed to walk the decks of the sunken ship, so, such a salvage operation was considered feasible. But, after several trial runs, the intense sea currents and the cumbersome nature of the half-ton diving suit caused the plans for filming and salvage operations to be abandoned.|$|R
60|$|Thus engaged, Edgar and his man Joe visited {{nearly all}} the wild places round the stormy shores of Great Britain and Ireland. They raised many ships {{from the bottom of}} the sea that had been {{pronounced}} by other engineers to be hopelessly lost. They laid foundations of piers and breakwaters in places where old Ocean had strewn wrecks since the foundation of the world. They cleared passages by blasting and levelling rocks whose stern crests had bid defiance to winds and waves for ages, and they <b>recovered</b> <b>cargoes</b> that had been given up for years to Neptune's custody. In short, wherever a difficult submarine operation had to be undertaken, Edgar Berrington and his man Joe, with, perhaps, a gang of divers under them, were pretty sure to be asked to undertake it.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a legal claim to the <b>recovered</b> <b>cargo,</b> Odyssey filed in U.S. court for an arrest of the cargo on April 4, 2007 and then published notice of that arrest on May 7, 2007. On May 31, 2007, the Spanish government, pursuant to the notice of the arrest, filed a claim against the <b>recovered</b> <b>cargo</b> based on {{the claim that the}} silver and gold coins recovered by Odyssey Marine came from a Spanish vessel, the Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes, a 36-gun Spanish frigate that went down off the Portuguese coast en route from Montevideo to Cádiz. The Mercedes, which was sunk by British Navy ships in October 1804, was known to be carrying more than a million silver dollars.|$|E

It was later proved in trial that the <b>recovered</b> <b>cargo</b> was being carried by the Spanish frigate Nuestra Señora de las Mercedes, which sank off Portugal in 1804.|$|E
5000|$|The Antikythera Ephebe is {{a bronze}} {{statue of a}} young man of languorous grace that was found in 1900 by sponge-divers {{in the area of the}} ancient [...] Antikythera {{shipwreck}} off the island of Antikythera, Greece. It was the first of the series of Greek bronze sculptures that the Aegean and Mediterranean yielded up in the twentieth century which have fundamentally altered the modern view of Ancient Greek sculpture. The wreck site, which is dated about 70-60 BC, also yielded the Antikythera Mechanism, an astronomical calculating device, a characterful head of a Stoic philosopher, and a hoard of coins. The coins included a disproportionate quantity of Pergamene cistophoric tetradrachms and Ephesian coins, leading scholars to surmise that it had begun its journey on the Ionian coast, perhaps at Ephesus; none of its <b>recovered</b> <b>cargo</b> has been identified as from mainland Greece.|$|E

50|$|Islamic {{glass from}} this period has been given {{relatively}} little attention by scholars. One exception to this was the work carried out by Carl J. Lamm (1902-1987). Lamm catalogued and classified the glass finds from important Islamic sites; for example Susa in Iran (Lamm 1931), and at Samarra in Iraq (Lamm 1928). One {{of the most important}} discoveries in the field of Islamic glass was a shipwreck dated to around 1036 AD on the Turkey coast at Serçe Liman. The <b>recovered</b> <b>cargo</b> included vessel fragments and glass cullet exported from Syria. The significance of these finds lies in the information they can tell us about the production and distribution of Islamic glass. Despite this, the majority of studies have concentrated on stylistic and decorative classification (Carboni 2001; Kröger 1995; Lamm 1928; Lamm 1931; Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001), and as such technological aspects of the industry, as well as undecorated vessels and objects, have often been overlooked within the field. This, in particular, is frustrating because the majority of glass finds during the Islamic period are undecorated and used for utilitarian purposes.|$|E
5000|$|Near Nantucket on 23 January 1909, City of Everett heard a {{distress}} {{signal from the}} RMS Republic, which was taking on water following a collision. Captain Thomas Fenlon of the City of Everett twice offered his ship's considerable pumping and towing abilities, but with assistance reportedly on {{the way from the}} White Star Line, Republic declined. Fog delayed tugs of the White Star Line, and towing efforts by the smaller US Coast Guard cutter Gresham failed. Republic sank the next day. Newspapers at the time reported that if the White Star Line had been successful in recovering the Republic with company ships, instead of using a third-party salvor, it could have recouped some of its salvage expenses from the owners of the <b>recovered</b> <b>cargo</b> aboard the Republic. The inference was that Republic's captain had refused aid merely to prevent another company from sharing the salvage award if the ship were to be saved. Everett's Captain Fenlon maintained that, as Republic had remained afloat until the day after the collision, she could have been saved if she had accepted a tow from City of Everett, stating that his boat was [...] "built for ocean towing" [...] and was equipped with [...] "tremendously powerful machinery and towing cables seven inches (178 mm) in diameter", as well as pumps with a capacity of [...] "two million gallons an hour".|$|E
