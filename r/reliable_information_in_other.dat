5000|$|Descartes {{also wrote}} a {{response}} to External world scepticism. Through this method of scepticism, he does not doubt {{for the sake of}} doubting but to achieve concrete and <b>reliable</b> <b>information.</b> <b>In</b> <b>other</b> words, certainty. He argues that sensory perceptions come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the [...] "propensity" [...] to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true “substance”. But minds are substances, meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.|$|E

40|$|A crucial change {{brought about}} by the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998 has been the {{requirement}} that local workforce agencies use training vouchers, known as Individual Training Accounts (ITAs), to provide training to their customers. Training vouchers are intended to maximize customer choice in training decisions. Theoretically, if individuals use vouchers to choose the training occupations and providers they value the most, the use of training vouchers should also generally maximize social welfare. However, the success of training vouchers in maximizing social welfare depends on individuals making sensible choices based on <b>reliable</b> <b>information.</b> <b>In</b> an actual training market, it may be difficult for individuals to collect <b>reliable</b> <b>information</b> about occupational opportunities and training providers or to use this <b>information</b> effectively <b>in</b> making sensible training choices.

In this paper, we exploit the pairwise salience distribution re-lationship between pedestrian images, and solve the person re-identification problem by proposing a salience matching strategy. To handle the misalignment problem in pedes-trian images, patch matching is adopted and patch salience is estimated. Matching patches with inconsistent salience brings penalty. Images {{of the same}} person are recognized by minimizing the salience matching cost. Furthermore, our salience matching is tightly integrated with patch match-ing in a unified structural RankSVM learning framework. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on the VIPeR dataset and the CUHK Campus dataset. It outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both datasets. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{describes an}} information management approach that elevates the orthodox "one size fits all" disclosure practice of environmental reports to a sophisticated digital stage, using environmental statements {{according to the}} European Union Eco-Management and Audit Scheme (EMAS) as an example. The information management approach is illustrated along three basic elements: (1) stakeholder analysis and information requirement analysis (representing information demand); (2) XML-based document engineering (modelling information supply); and (3) an IT-supported reporting system (cross-matching information supply and demand). As a result, environmental statements could be developed from universal documents on print media, and thus a mere EMAS requirement, to valuable environmental communication vehicles that provide substantial and <b>reliable</b> <b>information</b> <b>in</b> a tailored fashion and are available on various media—due to an underlying single source cross-media principle...|$|R
