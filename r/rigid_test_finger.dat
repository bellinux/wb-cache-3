5000|$|Common {{screening}} procedures for acalculia include asking {{the patient to}} answer questions about order, conducting memory tests to rule out the possibility of a mental disorder, confrontation naming (naming parts of objects), reading tests, writing <b>tests,</b> calculation <b>tests,</b> <b>finger</b> naming, clock drawing, and left/right orientation testing. The writing <b>tests,</b> spelling <b>tests,</b> <b>finger</b> naming, and left/right orientation are all tests to confirm the presence of Gerstmann's syndrome. Acalculia is one out of four defining components of Gerstmann's syndrome; the other three components are agraphia, finger agnosia, and right/left confusion. Typically, acalculia is present because of Gerstmann's syndrome or it is linked with other disorders. It is imperative to note that there is [...] "difficulty separating calculation disorders from disruptions in other domains". This is why testing functions besides calculation abilities is crucial for the screening of acalculia- so that other disorders can be ruled out. More extensive testing includes [...] "brain mapping techniques such as position emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and event related potentials (ERP), which have helped to illuminate some of the functional anatomical relationships for number processing".|$|R
40|$|Four {{methods for}} {{measuring}} disorders of vascular function and neurological function associated with occupational exposure to hand-transmitted vibration have been defined {{by reference to}} the available literature. For measuring vascular function the methods are: i) measures of the finger systolic blood pressure (FSBP) response to local cooling and ii) measures of the finger skin temperature (FST) response to local cooling. For measuring neurological function the methods are: i) measures of vibrotactile thresholds at the fingertips and ii) measures of thermal thresholds at the fingertips. Measures of the FSBP and the FST response to cold provocation were appraised in 109 dockyard workers. The FST test did not differentiate between 82 healthy subjects and 27 subjects with vibration-induced white finger (VWF) whilst the FSBP test {{was found to be}} sensitive, specific and responsive to VWF. Vibrotactile and thermal thresholds were found to be sensitive, specific and responsive to symptoms of numbness in another study of 104 dockyard workers, of whom 67 reported neurological disorders. It was concluded that whilst the above tests could be useful for monitoring the vascular and neurological disorders, a number of improvements to the measurement methods could be worthwhile. Further experiments were carried out to investigate these improvements. The simultaneous measurement of FSBPs on multiple <b>test</b> <b>fingers</b> was developed to improve the practicality of this test when measuring FSBPs on more than one <b>test</b> <b>finger.</b> Increased central sympathetic activity was hypothesised to result from increasing the stimulus by cooling more fingers. In two experiments on 12 healthy subjects, it was found that FSBPs measured simultaneously on four <b>test</b> <b>fingers</b> gave similar results to FSBP measurements on one <b>test</b> <b>finger.</b> Simultaneous FSBP measurements on four <b>test</b> <b>fingers</b> had comparable repeatability to measurements on one <b>test</b> <b>finger.</b> It was concluded that measuring FSBPs on multiple <b>test</b> <b>fingers</b> is a useful improvement to this test. When measuring FSBPs, changing the order of presentation and the period of recovery between thermal stimuli was hypothesised to influence the results by altering central sympathetic activity. In 12 healthy subjects {{it was found that the}} order of presentation of thermal stimuli was not important but that inter-subject variability increased when recovery was allowed between thermal stimuli. It was concluded that minimising the time interval between successive applications of thermal provocation reduces undesirable inter-subject variability. Another study on 12 healthy subjects showed that different reference measurement locations give different results. It was concluded that the thumb is suitable location for making reference measurements. The FSBP test and the FST test both involve application of cold provocation. The two tests are sometimes performed in succession but multiple thermal provocations may have cumulative effects on central sympathetic activity. When the two vascular tests were performed in succession on 36 subjects, including 12 subjects with VWF, any effects of the order of test presentation were small although a test performed first tended to be more repeatable. It was concluded that if both tests are performed consecutively, greater emphasis should be placed on the test performed first. The data for the FST test were reanalysed and showed that the sensitivity and specificity to VWF of this test is improved by changing the method of interpreting the results. Three methods of interpreting the FST response to cold provocation that represent an improvement to the test are suggested. The two vascular tests have been shown in the literature to be repeatable for healthy subjects but not for subjects with VWF. The repeatability of the vascular tests was assessed in 36 subjects (12 manual workers, 12 office workers and 12 subjects with VWF). The repeatability of both tests was found to be low amongst workers with VWF; some of these subjects showed a negative test result on one occasion and a positive test result on another occasion. It was concluded that a repeat test may be required when a false negative result is obtained. For the vibrotactile threshold test, the skin-stimulus contact force is usually controlled. Controlling the skin indentation would simplify measurement equipment. An experiment on ten healthy subjects investigated the relationship between skin-stimulus contact force, skin indentation and vibrotactile thresholds. It was concluded that the vibrotactile threshold test could be improved by implementing control of skin-indentation. Skin indentations giving comparable vibrotactile thresholds to those obtained using controlled contact forces were identified. It is concluded that a test battery comprising the four test methods identified from the literature and subsequently developed during the course of this research can be used to monitor disorders of both vascular and neurological function associated with occupational exposure to hand-transmitted vibration. A number of recommendations are made for further improvements that might be achievable as a result of further work...|$|R

Nine array accelerometer package data from dummy head were extracted from 13 lateral and 14 <b>rigid</b> pole crash <b>tests</b> conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Head accelerations, HIC values and their duration were computed. Cumulative strain damage measure 15 % (CSDM), dilatational damage measure (DDM), and relative motion damage measure (RMDM) were studied using SIMon finite element head model (FEHM). Averaged regional brain strains were conducted by grouping brain element in SIMon FEHM into frontal, parietal, occipital, cerebellum, fronix and brain stem region. Head contact occurred in two lateral and six <b>rigid</b> pole <b>tests.</b> Head contact durations were less than one millisecond in <b>rigid</b> pole <b>tests</b> and ranged from 3 - 7 ms in lateral impact tests. The ratio of biomechanical measurements between contact and non-contact cases in lateral tests were: translational acceleration 4 x, rotational acceleration 3. 5 x, HIC 12 x, and CSDM 5 x, regional brain 1. 5 x. The ratios were higher for rigid pole tests: translational acceleration 14 x, rotational acceleration 25. 7 x, HIC 29. 5 x, CSDM 12 x, regional brain strain 1. 5 - 3 x. Head accelerations, HIC values, DDM and RMDM increased with increasing rotational accelerations.

Design/methodology/approach – Experiment 1 (N = 120) used a 3 (degree of change: no vs small vs substantial change) unifactorial between-subjects design to develop the experimental paradigm for the effects of degrees of logo change. Experiment 2 (N = 148) examined effects of brand consciousness and exposure in a 3 (degree of change: original vs small vs substantial change) × 2 (exposure: 1 vs 3 exposures) between-subjects design with brand consciousness as a continuous moderator to extend the paradigm to a more naturalistic marketing communication setting. Findings – Substantial logo changes harmed processing speed of highly brand conscious consumers in particular. Furthermore, substantial logo changes decreased processing speed, which was compensated by repeated exposure to the redesigned brand logo. Practical implications – The findings suggest that brand consciousness creates a tunnel vision, which impairs openness to changes in brand image. Furthermore, the findings imply that brand logos can be (substantially) changed without hurting logo processing speed: only a few exposures are needed to neutralize these effects.

40|$|In humans, the flexor digitorum profundus (FDP), {{which is}} a multi-tendoned muscle, {{produces}} forces that flex the four distal interphalangeal joints of the fingers. We determined whether the force associated with activity in a single motor unit in the FDP was confined to a single finger or distributed {{to more than one}} finger during a natural grasp. The discharge of single low-threshold motor units (n = 69) was recorded at sites across the muscle during weak voluntary grasping involving all fingers and spike-triggered averaging of the forces under each of the finger pads was used to assess the distribution pattern. Spike-triggered averaging revealed that time-locked changes in force occurred under the ‘test’ finger (that finger on which the unit principally acted) as well as under the ‘non-test’ fingers. However, for the index-, middle- and ring-finger units, the changes in force under non-test fingers were typically small (50 % of those under the <b>test</b> <b>finger).</b> The distribution of forces by little-finger units differed significantly from that for each of the other three fingers. Apart from increases in force under non-test fingers, there was occasional unloading of adjacent fingers (22 / 267 combinations), usually affecting the index finger. The increases in force under the <b>test</b> <b>finger</b> correlated significantly with the background force for units acting on the middle, ring and little fingers.

40|$|While {{the human}} hand has an {{extraordinary}} capacity to manipulate objects, movement of its digits {{is usually not}} completely independent. These limits have been documented for extrinsic flexor muscles, although hand skills also require selectivity for extension movements. Hence, we measured the degree of independent control of the major extrinsic extensor (extensor digitorum, ED). Subjects grasped a cylinder, with the thumb perpendicular to the fingers. Load cells were connected to the proximal phalanges of the fingers and the thumb's distal phalanx. Intramuscular recordings using needle electrodes were made from the individual digital compartments of ED. Subjects were instructed to extend each digit isometrically in a voluntary ramp contraction to 50 % maximal force. In total, the behaviour of 283 single motor units was analysed. More {{than half of the}} units associated with one ‘test’ finger were recruited inadvertently when another digit contracted to 50 % maximum, with most units being recruited by extension of the adjacent digits. Usually, test motor units were recruited at higher forces by extension of fingers further from the <b>test</b> <b>finger.</b> Unexpectedly, extension of the thumb recruited many motor units acting on the little finger. Across tasks, at recruitment of the test motor units, the force produced by the <b>test</b> <b>finger</b> often differed between the voluntary and inadvertent contractions. Overall, the independent control of the output of ED is limited; this may reflect ‘spill-over’ of motor commands to other digital extensor compartments.
