The target is built like a frame and covered with rubber sheets front and back providing an almost tight sound-chamber. Inside the chamber there are microphones, either three {{in the bottom of}} the frame, or one in each of the four corners. Additionally, the air temperature inside the target is measured to precisely calculate the speed of sound. To avoid large temperature fluctuations the target is insulated in the front and back using insulating material like for instance styrofoam, and the target seen by the shooter is painted on the insulation material. To keep the sound-chamber somewhat tight, there is an additional <b>rubber</b> <b>liner</b> outside the main <b>rubber</b> <b>liner,</b> which can be turned manually or with an electric motor at certain intervals to avoid the holes in the sound chamber becoming too large.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{attempt was}} made to develop an {{ultrasonic}} nondestructive evaluation technique for detection of poor interfacial bonding between the <b>rubber</b> <b>liner</b> of a cylindrical rocket motor and the solid fuel propellant. The challenge originates from the very poor ultrasonic transmission properties of the <b>rubber</b> <b>liner,</b> and also from the acoustic impedance mismatch between the rubber and outer steel casing of the structure.

Attenuation of the <b>rubber</b> <b>liner</b> layer was assessed for both compression and shear modes using the Kramers-Kronig relationships to derive attenuation coefficients from dispersion curves; these showed the impracticality of guided modes for this test subject due to the enormous shear attenuation coefficient at frequencies above 500 kHz.

40|$|Ageing {{can lead}} to the {{degradation}} of the tensile properties of natural rubber. The ageing process causes changes in the polymer segmental motion as well as the chemical structure, both of which can be monitored using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This work demonstrates that NMR can quantify rubber degradation due to ageing, and also that relatively simple NMR equipment can be used. This simpler equipment can be made portable and so could give a simple and fast indication of the condition of rubber in service. The 1 H NMR transverse relaxation time, T 2, and the 13 C NMR spectrum using cross polarization and magic angle spinning (CP MAS) for samples taken at various levels of a degraded natural <b>rubber</b> <b>liner</b> were compared. These experiments showed that, as the level of degradation increased, the 1 H NMR transverse relaxation time decreased. The 13 C spectra showed considerable peak broadening, indicative of decreased mobility with increased level of degradation as well as the presence of degradation products. Further investigations using lower powered NMR equipment to measure the 1 H NMR transverse relaxation times of two different series of natural rubbers were also performed. This work has shown that this simpler method is also sensitive to structural and mechanical property changes in the rubber.

40|$|The {{disposal}} of large Off-the-Road (OTR) tires is {{an increasingly important}} concern. These tires can weigh up to 8, 450 pounds with an overall diameter and width of approximately 140. 7 inches and 45. 1 inches respectively. OTR tires are used for mining vehicles such as haul trucks, wheel loaders, backhoes, graders, and trenchers. [1] These new tires cost between $ 38, 000 and $ 50, 000 each, depending on multiple factors including oil prices and the cyclical nature of the industry. Haul trucks contain six tires per vehicle, and mines replace these tires around every 9 - 12 months. [2] Statistics regarding discarded OTR tires are not provided by the industry as they are for other types of tires. Thus, {{it is difficult to}} approximate the number and location of waste OTR tires not only in individual states, but in the U. S. in general. [3] Currently, Minnesota and Arizona are the only states that place regulations and fees on OTR tires. However, Minnesota is the only state that actually tracks them. [3] The Rubber Manufacturers Association (RMA) roughly estimates that OTR tires account for 1 % of scrap tires by number and 15 % by weight. When the tires are replaced, the old tires can be discarded with the waste rock in stockpiles at the mining site but more often are landfilled without documentation by an appropriate agency due to lack of federal regulations. Their low density and hollow centers cause them to float to the top of landfills, disrupting the compactness. [4] Also, tires have a heat content 20 - 40 % greater than that of coal which can be very dangerous on the rare occasions that tires catch fire in stockpiles. [5] Furthermore, burning tires release hazardous substances including pyrolytic oil, ash, and smoke, which contain carcinogens, heavy metals, and other toxic compounds. [6] Due to the large size of OTR tires, there are few facilities that can accommodate their recycling. [3] This leads to increased costs in transporting them to such sites. Transportation costs for a tire taken out of service can be up to $ 1000. In addition to the freight costs, recycling an OTR tire can cost up to $ 1500 because of their rugged construction compared to passenger tires which cost around $ 1 to recycle. [3] In response to the waste OTR tire problem, the Ball Hogs from the University of Arkansas have designed a solution that recycles OTR tires by using old tires as liners in ball mills for hard rock mines. Ball mills are large cylindrical vessels consisting of an outer shell, an inside liner and a load of metal balls. A motor turns the ball mill using a transmission system causing the metal balls to move in a cascading motion to grind the material fed into the ball mill. Ball mills require liners that are constructed from materials such as steel or rubber. For a 30 ft long ball mill with a Task # 2 5 University of Arkansas 20 ft diameter, a hard <b>rubber</b> <b>liner</b> reinforced with steel can cost $ 150, 000. These liners are replaced at least once a year, creating a substantial upkeep cost for these ball mills. Metal mines in Bolivia are already using tractor tires to line many ball mills. This technique has been effective for over twenty years. The high import costs of new liners and the low cost of labor has led many Bolivian metal processors to use truck and tractor tires as liners in their ball mills. This construction normally occurs on site using tools like handsaws, drills, torches and knives to cut up tires and manpower to mount these tire-made liners onto mills. However, this is not always the case in the U. S. where labor costs are much higher and the mills are generally larger. Many mines in the U. S. do not have the means to fabricate and install these liners on site; therefore, a third-party solution is proposed that will take a mine’s discarded tires and make ball mill liners out of them. The Ball Hogs’ solution provides an environmentally and economically feasible process of increasing the life of OTR tires beyond their typical use. This alternative would utilize the engineering and technology that makes these tires strong enough to hold a 400 ton truck. Mining companies would save yearly an average of $ 70, 000 per ball mill liner replacement, and over 780, 000 kg of CO 2 per liner. Furthermore, mining companies would earn positive PR, goodwill, and tax breaks. We recommend all mining companies use their OTR tire treads as ball mill liners...|$|E

We describe the occurrence of two Klebsiella mastitis outbreaks on a single dairy farm. Klebsiella isolates from milk, feces, and environmental sources were compared using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) -PCR typing. The first mastitis outbreak {{was caused by a}} single strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae, RAPD type A, which was detected in milk from eight cows. RAPD type A was also isolated from the <b>rubber</b> <b>liners</b> of milking machine units after milking of infected cows and from bedding in the outbreak pen. Predominance of a single strain could indicate contagious transmission of the organism or exposure of multiple cows to an environmental point source. No new cases with RAPD type A were observed after implementation of intervention measures that targeted the prevention of transmission via the milking machine as well as improvement of environmental hygiene. A second outbreak of Klebsiella mastitis that occurred several weeks later was caused by multiple RAPD types, which rules out contagious transmission and indicates opportunistic infections originating from the environment. The diversity of Klebsiella strains as quantified with Simpson's index of discrimination was significantly higher for isolates from fecal, feed, and water samples than for isolates from milk samples.

40|$|Mill liner is an {{important}} part of mill. It has to withstand strikes and wear. Nowadays mill liners can be made of many different materials. In this work the focus is mainly on <b>rubber</b> <b>liners.</b> The aim of this thesis is to get better understanding how the properties of rubber affect to wear resistance of rubber material. Coumpounds including natural rubber and/or styrene butadiene rubber are widely used in mill liners. Their properties are good enough in applications where wear resistance is needed and they are also cost-effective. Moreover processing of these rubbers is not difficult. Many kinds of wear types occur with rubber materials during their use. The greatest of them is abrasive wear. Moreover impact wear, erosion wear and fatigue wear cause wearing of mill liners. Naturally each wear type has its own characteristics and different mechanisms. Sometimes testing of material wear is difficult and takes a lot of time. Different wear simulation methods can be used to reduce this work. One of them is 'Discrete Element Method' i. e. DEM. In this method Newton's laws of motion are used to describe motions of particles and their contact with next to each other particles. DEM also offers a possibility to simulate behaviour of mills in different situations. Thus, the method can be applied to evaluating wear of mill liners too. Material wear properties can be tested by different methods. Some of the can be mentioned. One of them is rotary tribometer which produces sliding to the surface of sample. The other is Goodrich-fleksometer which makes possible to compare hysteretic behaviour of vulcanized rubber compounds. Test methods which mimic abrasive, impact and erosion wear were selected to the experimental part. Mass reduction of samples was measured during testing. From these tests more information was gained of wear resistance of rubber materials which are used in mill liners when they are exposed to different wear models and selection of materials which can be applied to mill liners...|$|R
