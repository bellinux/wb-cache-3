5|$|With {{the worst}} of the aircraft's {{problems}} believed to have been resolved, the XR-1 was submitted for service testing by the Army Air Forces in 1943. During the course of the Army's evaluations, the XR-1's empennage failed during structural testing, the surfaces being strengthened as a result and testing, following the repairs, resuming in 1944. Despite the modifications to the design, however, the XR-1 still proved to be deficient in control authority. In July 1943, the XR-1 program suffered a setback when the aircraft crashed, seriously injuring test pilot Jim Ray, who had replaced Leavitt following the latter's dismissal from the company. The crash was caused by an inspector's error in leaving a suspect part on the aircraft, the rotor hub failing in flight {{as a result of the}} decision. The aircraft was repairable, but it would be a year before the XR-1 was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> again.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} on April 4, 1968, by Apollo 6 (AS-502) which carried a CSM and a LM Test Article as ballast. The intent of this {{mission was to}} achieve trans-lunar injection, followed closely by a simulated direct-return abort, using the Service Module engine to achieve another high-speed reentry. The Saturn V experienced pogo oscillation, a problem caused by non-steady engine combustion, which damaged fuel lines {{in the second and}} third stages. Two S-II engines shut down prematurely, but the remaining engines were able to compensate. The damage to the third stage engine was more severe, preventing it from restarting for trans-lunar injection. Mission controllers were able to use the Service Module engine to essentially repeat the flight profile of Apollo 4. Based on the good performance of Apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the Apollo 6 problems, NASA declared the Saturn V <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> men, cancelling a third unmanned test.|$|E

5000|$|Hanyok {{emphasizes}} that the US, in the early 1960s, considered Laos, not South Vietnam, the critical area. The Department of Defense prepared alternative operational plans for US combat troops in Laos and Thailand. To support this, [...] "a Laotian Watch Office was set up with twenty-four-hours-a-day operations, seven days a week. A special TDY duty team was <b>readied</b> <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>to</b> the ASA site at Clark Air Base {{to set up a}} second-echelon SIGINT reporting mission. (SIGINT reporting can be performed at various levels, or echelons. Field site reporting is considered first-echelon. If a unit has no reporting capability, then its intercept is forward to an intermediate site that is considered [...] "second-echelon")". The Laotian situation calmed, but flared again in May 1962. The US again prepared a combat force, made of Seventh Fleet ships that sailed into the Gulf of Siam. A battalion of Marines was airlifted to Udon, to supplement forces already there. NSA again went to a theaterwide SIGINT condition BRAVO, including at the year-old ASA facility at Tan Son Nhut airbase near Saigon.|$|R

At 09:15, when the convoy was about [...] south-south-west of [...] Junkers Ju 88s dive-bombers of Lehrgeschwader 1 (LG 1) were intercepted [...] out. Four Ju 88s were shot down and another two were claimed by navy anti-aircraft gunners (German records showed five shot down and two lost over Sardinia from mechanical failure) {{for the loss of}} one FAA fighter. The German crews made extravagant claims but did little damage and three Italian reconnaissance aircraft were also shot down. Beaufighters returning from a raid on Sardinia, saw the 7th Cruiser Division (Da Zara) at sea and raised the alarm.

50|$|In 1959, NASA's Silverstein Committee issued {{recommendations}} {{to develop the}} Saturn class launch vehicles, growing from the C-1. When the Apollo program was started in 1961 {{with the goal of}} landing men on the Moon, NASA chose the Saturn I for Earth orbital test missions. However, the Saturn I's payload limit of 20000 lb would allow testing of only the Command Module with a smaller propulsion module attached, as the Apollo Command/Service Module would have a dry weight of at least 26300 lb, in addition to service propulsion and reaction control fuel. In July 1962, NASA announced selection of the C-5 for the lunar landing mission, and decided to develop another launch vehicle by upgrading the Saturn I, replacing its S-IV second stage with the S-IVB, which would also be modified for use as the Saturn V third stage. The S-I first stage would also be upgraded to the S-IB by improving the thrust of its engines and removing some weight. The new Saturn IB, with a payload capability of at least 16000 kg, would replace the Saturn I for Earth orbit testing, allowing the Command/Service Module <b>to</b> be <b>flown</b> with a partial fuel load. It would also allow launching the 32000 lb Lunar Excursion Module separately for unmanned and manned Earth orbital testing, before the Saturn V was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>flown.</b> It would also give early development to the third stage.|$|R
