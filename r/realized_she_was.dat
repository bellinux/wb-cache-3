Gillette agreed to take her away to the Adirondacks, apparently promising marriage - but because Brown packed her entire wardrobe for the trip, while Gillette packed just a small suitcase, some 21st-century historians conjecture that Gillette had merely promised to take Brown to a home for unwed mothers in upstate New York. Gillette and Brown went by train and coach to Big Moose in Herkimer County, New York.|$|E

2500|$|I {{first met}} Temple {{in the mid-1980s}} [...] annual [...] conference. Standing on the {{periphery}} of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions.

I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [...] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [...] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive ("like being tied to the rail and the train's coming"). She was asked many questions: [...] "Why does my son do so much spinning?" [...] "Why does he hold his hands to his ears?" [...] "Why doesn't he look at me?" [...] She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day.

In 1977, the success of Apple was now {{a part of their}} relationship, [...] and Brennan, Daniel Kottke, and Jobs moved into a house near the Apple office in Cupertino. Brennan eventually took a position in the shipping department at Apple [...] Brennan's relationship with Jobs was deteriorating as his position with Apple grew, and she began to consider ending the relationship through small changes. In October 1977, Brennan was approached by Rod Holt, who asked her to take [...] "a paid apprenticeship designing blueprints for the Apples." [...] Both Holt and Jobs felt {{that it would be a}} good position for her, given her artistic abilities. Holt was particularly eager that she take the position and puzzled by her ambivalence toward it. Brennan's decision, however, was overshadowed by the fact that she <b>realized</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> pregnant and that Jobs was the father. It took her a few days to tell Jobs, whose face, according to Brennan [...] "turned ugly" [...] at the news. At the same time, according to Brennan, at the beginning of her third trimester, Jobs said to her: [...] "I never wanted to ask that you get an abortion. I just didn't want to do that." [...] He also refused to discuss the pregnancy with her. Brennan herself felt confused about what to do. She was estranged from her mother and afraid to discuss the matter with her father. She also did not feel comfortable with the idea of having an abortion. She chose instead to discuss the matter with Kobun, who encouraged her to have and keep the baby, and pledged his support. Meanwhile, Holt was waiting for her decision on the internship. Brennan states that Jobs continued to encourage her to take the internship, stating she could [...] "be pregnant and work at Apple, you can take the job. I don't get what the problem is." [...] Brennan however notes that she [...] "felt so ashamed: the thought of my growing belly in the professional environment at Apple, with the child being his, while he was unpredictable, in turn being punishing and sentimentally ridiculous. I could not have endured it." ...|$|E
