5|$|Red Bull Racing {{suffered}} a double retirement, with Vettel falling victim to another alternator failure and Mark Webber spinning violently at the Ascari chicane, with the <b>resultant</b> <b>damage</b> to his tyres sending vibrations {{through the car}} that forced him to retire. This allowed Hamilton to leapfrog both drivers and Kimi Räikkönen – who finished the race fifth – to take {{second place in the}} World Drivers' Championship, with the result enabling McLaren to close the gap to Red Bull in the World Constructors' Championship.|$|E
5|$|Testing of the Disney bombs {{began in}} early 1945. Bombs were {{initially}} dropped on a bombing range near Southampton to photographically record their trajectory and calibrate bombsights. This was necessary as the flight-path of a rocket-accelerated bomb differed considerably {{from that of}} a free–falling bomb. Test drops were then conducted on the Watten bunker, German codename Kraftwerk Nord West (now known as the Blockhaus d'Éperlecques), a large German concrete bunker near Watten in northern France. This was ideal for the purpose as the area had been captured by Allied forces in September 1944, so damage to the structure could be inspected after bomb tests. Four bombs, carried by two B-17s, were used and two hits scored on the target. The <b>resultant</b> <b>damage</b> was considered satisfactory by Royal Navy observers on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Saturday's {{afternoon}} qualifying session {{lasted for}} an hour. Each driver {{was limited to}} twelve laps, with the grid order decided by the drivers' fastest laps. During this session, the 107% rule was in effect, which necessitated each driver set a time within 107% of the quickest lap {{to qualify for the}} race. The session was held in dry and sunny conditions. Michael Schumacher clinched his third pole position of the season, his fifth at the circuit, with a time of 1:18.439. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Coulthard who qualified 0.098 seconds behind Michael Schumacher's time having battled the Ferrari driver for grid position throughout the session. Barrichello qualified in 3rd position and was happy with his Ferrari. Häkkinen encountered traffic during his qualifying runs and managed fourth. Frentzen, who qualified 5th, had to overcome heavy gusts at the L'Epingle hairpin where he found it difficult to find his braking spot. Villeneuve was sixth with teammate Zonta in eighth. Trulli split them for seventh position. Pedro de la Rosa in an Arrows car and Fisichella completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. Herbert missed out on qualifying in the top ten by two hundredths of a second though {{he said that he was}} happy with his car. Ralf Schumacher set the 12th quickest time despite his Williams suffering a lack of mechanical grip. He was ahead of Verstappen who crashed his car at turn 4 which caused a temporary suspension to qualifying. The <b>resultant</b> <b>damage</b> caused him to use his team's spare monocoque. Wurz, in the second Benetton, lost time when he caught the aftermath of Verstappen's collision and was 14th fastest. Salo battled with his rear wheel locking on downshifts and took 15th. He started in front of Irvine in the slower of the two Jaguars. Jean Alesi's Prost qualified 17th despite an engine failure, ahead of Button and Diniz. The Minardi drivers qualified at the back of the grid, covering positions 20 to 22 with Heidfeld splitting them for 21st.|$|E

5000|$|The {{police in}} Minister of Safety & Security v Hamilton were negligent in their {{consideration}} and approval of {{an application for}} a firearm licence, accepting the correctness of information supplied by the applicant. They had a legal duty to [...] "exercise reasonable care in considering, investigating, recommending and ultimately granting" [...] such applications. Their failure properly to exercise this duty had resulted in the issuing of a firearm licence to an unfit person, who subsequently shot the respondent. The State was held to be delictually liable for the <b>resultant</b> <b>damages.</b>|$|R
25|$|With {{construction}} curtailed on {{the first}} site by the Second Boer War, the Army began work at Longmoor Camp. After being laid out by the Royal Engineers in August 1900, construction materials were transported from Bentley railway station, with the <b>resultant</b> <b>damage</b> by commercial traction engines to the public roads bringing about the first trial of pneumatic tyred lorries to the British Army.|$|E
25|$|On 29 July 1943, as Tuna set {{out from}} Brisbane on her eighth patrol, a Royal Australian Air Force patrol bomber {{attacked}} her, dropping three bombs close aboard. The <b>resultant</b> <b>damage</b> necessitated 17 days of major repairs at Brisbane, delaying her departure for the eighth patrol until 21 August. Once on station, two attack opportunities presented themselves, but neither one bore fruit.|$|E
25|$|In 1845, Angell began {{studying}} at Brown, {{which at the}} time had a total of only seven instructors on the faculty. He graduated in 1849, and eventually obtained part-time jobs as an Assistant Librarian at the university and tutoring a boy whose eyesight prevented him from reading. In 1850, he came down with a cold and sore throat, but he refused to give his throat any rest from the daily exertion of reading aloud to his pupil. The <b>resultant</b> <b>damage</b> to his throat would last {{the rest of his life}} and make extended speaking difficult.|$|E

500|$|The storm caused severe beach erosion in Bay County; {{approximately}} [...] of sand was removed. Storm-related {{changes in}} the coastal topography resulted in extensive structural damage in the Panama City Beach area. The most severe damage was concentrated in a [...] area of the shore east of the hurricane's eye, and storm surge peaked in intensity {{for no more than}} a half hour according to preliminary estimates. Much of the <b>resultant</b> <b>damage</b> came as a result of foundation undermining, which was compared to that of the New England hurricane of 1938. Although Eloise was not abnormally strong, the geographicy setting and building standards in the area were blamed for the destruction of many homes and businesses. Monetary losses from property damage in Panama City Beach alone totaled about $50 million.|$|E
500|$|Burnham, {{being the}} largest {{occupied}} town within the 1981 surge affected area, also bore {{the brunt of}} the <b>resultant</b> <b>damage.</b> 400 properties were affected, with pavements, stone and concrete from the sea wall ripped up and the Esplande destroyed; total damage within the parish was estimated at £1.5M. Although emergency repairs were undertaken, Wessex Water Authority began planning new sea defences for the town. Construction work started in 1983 on a £7M scheme, creating what was then Britain’s biggest wave return wall. The scheme raised the level of the sea wall and the promenade by , by creating a [...] long and [...] high sea wall, and a new wider Esplanade. Taking five years to complete and coming into operation in 1988, beach access is now via a series of raised steps for visitors, with three vehicle access points which can be closed during storms using sealed gates.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1943, in {{his last}} patrol in U-617, Brandi sank , a Hunt class destroyer, off Gibraltar. A few days later, {{on the night of}} 10 September, she was {{attacked}} near the Moroccan coast by Royal Air Force Wellington aircraft from No. 179 Squadron piloted by Squadron Leader D. B. Hodgkinson in position [...] damaging U-617. Three hours later, on 11 September, another No. 179 Squadron aircraft piloted by Pilot Officer W. H. Brunini dropped more depth charges. The <b>resultant</b> <b>damage</b> to U-617 was so severe that Brandi could no longer risk to dive. To avoid capture, Brandi decided to sail U-617 to shallow waters and abanded ship off Melilla, Spanish Morocco in position [...] After evacuating into rubber boats, the crew managed to reach the shore without loss and were interned by Spanish troops. Brandi was loosely confined in the officers' camp near Cadiz.

40|$|Oxidative stress {{has been}} implicated {{to play a}} role, at least in part, in {{pathogenesis}} of many disease conditions and toxicities in animals. Overproduction of reactive oxygen species and free radicals beyond the cells intrinsic capacity to neutralize following xenobiotics exposure leads {{to a state of}} oxidative stress and <b>resultant</b> <b>damages</b> of lipids, protein, and DNA. Lead and cadmium are the common environmental heavy metal pollutants and have widespread distribution. Both natural and anthropogenic sources including mining, smelting, and other industrial processes are responsible for human and animal exposure. These pollutants, many a times, are copollutants leading to concurrent exposure to living beings and resultant synergistic deleterious health effects. Several mechanisms have been explained for the damaging effects on the body system. Of late, oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the lead- and cadmium-induced pathotoxicity. Several ameliorative measures to counteract the oxidative damage to the body system aftermath or during exposure to these toxicants have been assessed with the use of antioxidants. The present review focuses on mechanism of lead- and cadmium-induced oxidate damages and the ameliorative measures to counteract the oxidative damage and pathotoxicity with the use of supplemented antioxidants for their beneficial effects...|$|R
50|$|Since it is {{currently}} unknown whether life forms exist on Mars, the mission could potentially transfer viable organisms resulting in back contamination—the introduction of extraterrestrial organisms into Earths biosphere. The scientific consensus is that the potential for large-scale effects, either through pathogenesis or ecological disruption, is extremely small. Nevertheless, returned samples from Mars will be treated as potentially biohazardous until scientists can determine that the returned samples are safe. The goal {{is to reduce the}} probability of release of a Mars particle to less than one in a million. In addition, the proposed NASA Mars Sample Return mission will not be approved by NASA until the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process has been completed. The NEPA process would require a public review of all potential impacts that could result from MSR, including worst case back contamination scenarios. It is likely that a formal Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) would have to be prepared. Furthermore, under the terms of Article VII of the Outer Space Treaty and probably various other legal frameworks, were a release of organisms to occur, the releasing nation or nations would be liable for any <b>resultant</b> <b>damages.</b>|$|R
