40|$|NOVELTY - The {{removal of}} solid {{particles}} from a liquid is by a sieve centrifuge. The fluid {{to be filtered}} is discharged into the rotating sieve. Liquid passes through the sieve, while concentrated solid particles are retained and discharged from time to time. The rotating sieve also generates primary and secondary turbulence which prevents blockage of the sieve by the concentrate. The direction of liquid flow into the sieve promotes a self-cleaning action. USE - To remove particulate matter from a liquid, especially water. ADVANTAGE - The process is capable of either continual or <b>batch</b> <b>charge</b> operation and provides a high performance specific filtration.

The effect of particle size, initial bed temperature, air flow rate and different semi-coke percentages on the burnout time was investigated. The results have shown that an increase in bed temperature or air flow rate {{was associated with a}} decrease in burnout time. On the contrary, an increase in particle mean size led to an increase in burnout time. The most significant difference occurred with mixtures on the burnout time. The trend is increasing and then decreasing...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we report results {{regarding}} the in vitro antimicrobial activity of Inula helenium L. dried root extracts obtained by stepwise supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and by hydrodistillation (HD). Inula helenium L. (Compositae family) is a perennial plant widely occurring in Europe and East Asia. Its oil {{is one of}} the richest sources of sesquiterpenoid lactones, which have strong anthelminthic activity and have the potential to induce detoxifying enzymes. Inula helenium L. roots (C- 040705130905) were purchased from Minardi (Bagnacavallo-Ravenna, Italy). Supercritical CO 2 extraction was performed in a laboratory apparatus equipped with a 400 cm 3 extraction vessel operated in the single-pass mode of passing CO 2 through the fixed bed of charged vegetable particles. Extraction was carried out in a semibatch mode: <b>batch</b> <b>charging</b> of vegetable matter and continuous flow solvent.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{literature}} dealing with ball milling, a part Bibliography o£ which is given in the Appendix, leads to a first conclusion that considerable research has been undertaken on this subject. However, on closer study, {{it is apparent that}} {{a great deal of the}} work has been purely academic and of very little use to the practical mill operator. In the first place a large part of the llterature is devoted to the development of mathematical theories of crushing and their approval or condemnation; in the second place much of the practical work performed in laboratories has been done with inadequate equipment, that is if the results are to be applied to actual milling practice. Small laboratory mills with <b>batch</b> <b>charges</b> cannot be expected to give conditions approaching those in a full size mill with continuous feed and discharge. In the paper it is claimed that a 2 foot mill could be used to forecast the work of a commercial mill. This may be so, and, if truef establishes the 5 foot mill used at McGill University as a very desirable one for the same purpose. It supports the contention of the writer that anything smaller than a 2 foot mill is liable to give erroneous results...|$|R

40|$|This work {{examines}} the fundamental behaviour of granular materials in packed/moving beds under simplified blast furnace conditions. Such study {{has a significant}} impact on the development of new technology such as pulverized coal injection and the performance of blast furnace operation. Experiments have shown that a number of interesting phenomena appear in blast furnace operation. These phenomena involve rich granular dynamics which currently attract strong interest from a wide scientific and engineering. However, previous work on this area, limited by the research techniques, is predominantly at large scales focusing on phenomenological descriptions, but rarely touching on the basic fundamentals governing these phenomena. A novel discrete element simulation at an individual particle level can overcome these problems. For this purpose, this work conducts a systematic study of these important phenomena, including crater formation, coke collapse, creep motion and particle percolation, by use of the discrete element method (DEM). The experiments and simulations conducted in the impact of a particle stream onto a particle bed using a 20 slot model suggest that the DEM can reproduce the experimental results well under comparative conditions. The crater size is shown to be affected by the discharging rate, discharging height and materials properties, and is related to the ratio of the input energy from the falling stream to the inertial energy from the original packing. Fundamental understanding of coke collapse based on three different configurations: <b>batch</b> <b>charging,</b> self loading and load impact have been investigated. It was found that coke collapse is a kind of continuous avalanche due to top layer particles spreading. Apparent frozen layer under rapidly flowing layer is not stationary and slowly creep motion can be detected at an arbitrary depth. The mean velocity of creep motion decays exponentially with depth. Percolation happens due to both gravity and strain. The percolation velocity under gravity is much greater than that under shear. Size ratio effect is most significant. For size ratio smaller than threshold gravity induced percolation dominate otherwise shear due to the descending of the packed bed. Additionally, this work demonstrates the value of DEM as a tool for complementing experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well-known}} that production scheduling can be largely categorized into open and closed-shops (Graves (1981)). Open-shops are job-shops, flow-shops, machine-shops and project-shops and deal exclusively with the assignment, sequencing and timing decisions (Pinedo (1995)). Closed-shops {{on the other}} hand also deal with the same three decision-groups as open-shops but they also must decide on the sizing of lots, <b>charges,</b> <b>batches</b> and movements in order to properly program production especially with finite inventory capacity. Arguably open-shops are a subset of closed-shops. The {{purpose of this article is}} to overview a production model and its data which is comprehensive enough to schedule the breadth and depth of all plants found in the process industries. We achieve this by extending the state and resource-task networks (STN and RTN; Kondili et. al. (1993) and Pantelides (1994)) to explicitly include the aspects of limited routings between unit-operations and other unit-operations up and downstream in the material flow path as well as dealing directly with the complexity of charge/batch-splitting into movements. We call this novel production modeling approach the unit-operation-stock superstructure (UOSS) which is the cross-product of the physical (units) and the procedural (operations) models or substructures...|$|R

The sawdust was characterized using Scanning Electron Microscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared spectrophotometry, X-ray diffraction, and pH point of zero <b>charge.</b> <b>Batch</b> adsorption experiments were carried out to determine the equilibrium characteristics, thermodynamics, and kinetics of the sorption processes. The data obtained were subjected to various isotherm and kinetics equations. The results showed that the adsorption processes were described by different isotherm models depending on the composition of the system; they were all spontaneous (ΔG ranges from − 0. 72 to − 5. 36 [*]kJ/mol) and endothermic (range of ΔH is 11. 37 – 26. 31 [*]kJ/mol) and with increased randomness with ΔS values of 55. 55 and 98. 78 [*]J·mol/K for single and ternary systems, respectively.

40|$|Background: The {{importance}} of clean air in industrial workplaces is well known. Cement dust, {{due to its}} silica content, is very dangerous. The aims {{of this study were}} to assess and control the release of cement dust from silos of concrete <b>batching</b> units during <b>charging</b> and production processes in a dam project. Methods: In this study, dust particule mass released from the cement silos were investigated by performing environmental samplingandpersonal sampling from 15 operators of batching machine. Samples were analyzed by gravimetric method. Control methods were used to control the released dust. Data collected before and after the intervention were analyzed through SPSS 19 and using paired t- test and one sample t- test. Results: Mean concentrations of dust particles masses in personal and environmental samples were respectively 15. 56 and 30. 77 mg/m 3 and both were higher than the standard exposure limit values in Iran. After implementation of dust control methods, mean concentrations of dust in personal and environmental samples decreased respectively to 4. 1 and 5. 2 mg/m 3 that show the efficiency of control methods. Conclusion: The control method applied in the present study is a novel and cost-effective method to control the released particles from batching units of cement silos. It is possible to decrease the dust concentration in industrial workplaces to the standard levels, by performing simiar methods. Keywords: Dust, Cement, Batching Silo, Dam Constructio...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} was to explain the differences in the adsorption mechanisms and adsorption capacities of natural and Fe(III) -modified zeolite for Pb 2 +, Zn 2 + and Cd 2 + ions. The adsorbents were characterized with respect to their phase composition, morphology, specific surface area, cation exchange capacity and point of zero <b>charge.</b> <b>Batch</b> adsorption experiments were performed {{as a function of the}} initial ion concentration and temperature, at constant initial pH value of 5. 5 ± 0. 1. The adsorption isotherms at 25, 40, 55 and 70 °C suggest that the sequence of adsorption efficiency of both zeolites is Pb 2 + > Zn 2 + > Cd 2 +. The adsorption capacities of both zeolites increased with increasing temperature. The equilibrium adsorption data were best described by the Langmuir adsorption isotherm. This study revealed that the adsorption capacity of the Fe(III) -modified zeolite is much higher than that of natural zeolite for all investigated ions owing to the higher: specific adsorption caused by the new functional groups formed on the zeolite surface; ion exchange due to the presence of easily exchangeable ions; and hydroxide precipitation caused by higher point of zero charge of the Fe(III) -modified zeolite compared to natural zeolite.

The mobile patrols used the [...] "mothership" [...] concept to resupply their mounted patrols, along with the DPVs, a number of cut-down Unimog and ACMAT VLRA trucks were infiltrated into the area of operations and served as mobile resupply points, themselves being stocked with fuel, ammunition and water by RAF Chinook drops, {{this meant that the}} SAS mobility patrols could effectively stay in the area of operations indefinitely. During one mission an operator reportedly destroyed a SCUD launcher with a vehicle-mounted Milan anti-tank guided missile. An Iraqi Army command-and-control site known as [...] "Victor Two" [...] was attacked by the SAS: SAS operators crept in to the facility and set a <b>batch</b> of demolition <b>charges</b> which were counting down to detonation when they were compromised, the SAS destroyed Iraqi bunkers with Milans and LAW rockets, operators engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Iraqi soldiers. The operators broke cover and braved enemy fire to reach their vehicles and escape before the demolition exploded. Another mounted patrol from D squadron was bedding down for the night in a desert wadi, later they discovered they were camped next to an Iraqi communications facility, they were quickly compromised by an Iraqi soldier walking to their position. A firefight erupted between the SAS and at least two regular Iraqi Army infantry platoons. The patrol managed to break contact after disabling two Iraqi technicals (pick-up trucks) that attempted to pursue them, during the chaos of the firefight a supply Unimog had been immobilised by enemy fire and left behind with no sign of the seven missing crew members. The seven SAS operators (one of whom was severely wounded) had captured a damaged Iraqi technical and drove toward the Saudi Arabian border, eventually the vehicle ground to a halt and the men were forced to travel on foot, after 5 days they reached the border.|$|R
