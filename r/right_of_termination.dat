5000|$|An {{author has}} the {{inalienable}} right to terminate a copyright transfer 35 years after agreeing to permanently relinquish the copyright. However, {{according to the}} US Copyright Office, Circular 9 [...] "the termination provisions of the law {{do not apply to}} works made for hire." [...] These restrictions, in both the work for hire doctrine and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination,</b> exist out of recognition that artists frequently face unequal bargaining power in their business dealings. Nonetheless, failure to secure a work-for-hire agreement by commissioning organizations can create difficult situations. One such example is the artist Raymond Kaskey's 1985 statue Portlandia, an iconic symbol of the city of Portland, Oregon. Unlike most works of public art, Kaskey has put strong prohibitions on the use of images of the statue, located atop the main entrance to the famous Portland Building. He sued Paramount Pictures for including shots of the statue in the Madonna motion picture Body of Evidence. As a result, it is nearly impossible to film portions of one of downtown Portland's most vibrant neighborhoods, and the city has lost out on the potential to create merchandise and souvenirs from one of its most iconic landmarks.|$|E

Under risk neutrality, we find that (1) it does not matter for investments and economic efficiency to whom this right belongs, although it may affect contractual terms and income sharing, and (2) although the allocation <b>of</b> this <b>right</b> does not matter, its inclusion can have either a positive or a negative effect on economic efficiency.

40|$|Recently, {{courts have}} embraced the contractarian theory that {{corporate}} charters and bylaws constitute a “contract” between the shareholders and the corporation and have been more willing to uphold bylaws unilaterally adopted by the directors. This paper examines the contractarian theory by drawing a parallel between amending charters and bylaws, on the one hand, and amending contracts, on the other. In particular, the paper compares the right to unilaterally amend corporate bylaws {{with the right to}} unilaterally modify contract terms, and highlights how contract law imposes various limitations on the modifying party’s discretion. More generally, when the relationship of contracting parties is compared to that of shareholders and managers, the paper notes several important differences that could make shareholders (particularly, minority shareholders) more vulnerable to potential hold-up and counter-party opportunism. For example, unlike contracting parties who have the right to terminate the contractual relationship or opt out of undesirable modifications, shareholders lack the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> or opt-out. As a possible solution, the paper considers various mechanisms, including optional redemption, more robust disclosure, shareholder voting, and active judicial oversight. The paper suggests that active judicial oversight, through vigorous application of the “proper” and “equitable” purpose test or imposition of good faith and fair dealing obligations, would be better in retaining the desired flexibility and policing opportunism by both managers and controlling shareholders...|$|E
40|$|International {{sales of}} commodities, often involve {{large sums of}} money and large {{shipments}} of goods. The CIF contract has been chosen as subject for my analysis on the ground that it is the contract most commonly used in international commodity sales. Commonly, the original contracting parties are only part of string sales, the tendered documents will have to be passed down the string until they reach the final buyer. Because commodity markets are subject to drastic fluctuations, the contracts that take place in them are likely to be time sensitive in regards to the tendering and passing on of the notices and documents, these time limits must be strictly complied with it. Furthermore, because of the short time within which these documents must be considered and passed on, it is obviously important that the buyer should be able to determine his termination rights immediately after he becomes aware of any non-conformity disclosed in the documents. This important commercial decision whether to refuse the tender of non-conforming documents should not be complicated by asking the buyer to consider what the likely effect of any loss will be. The existence of predictable termination rights allow the buyer and seller to know exactly where they stand when such breach has occurred and will avoid timely and costly litigations. Termination {{is one of the most}} practically effective remedies in the context of international documentary sales of commodities. It can be considered as nearly eternal legal problem for the parties in the context of the commodities sales. It has a reappearing tendency on the agenda of sales lawyers, banks and insurance companies. Also, the commodities traders are very much interested in accurate assessment of their negotiating and settlement position. This question will be addressed under two major legal sources, i. e. English law and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods 1980 (hereinafter CISG or the Convention) because of their significance in the international trade law. The debate about what law is best for dealing international commodities and documentary trade often centers on the comparison of the English law and the CISG. The thesis should be therefore considered as an attempt to contribute to this debate further by examining the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> within the documentary and commodities trade...|$|E

40|$|We analyze how contractibility {{affects the}} design of contracts. Our {{empirical}} application is biotechnology research. A major concern in biotechnology research agreements is that the researchers might use their funding to subsidize other projects. We develop a model that allows for researchers to pursue multiple projects. When research activities are contractible, a complete contract achieves the first best. When research activities are not contractible, instead, an option contract is optimal. The financing firm obtains the right to terminate the research agreement and, in case <b>of</b> <b>termination,</b> broad property <b>rights.</b> The threat <b>of</b> <b>termination</b> induces the researchers {{to adhere to the}} proposed research agenda, while the cost of exercising the option deters the financing firm from opportunistically terminating the agreement.

Usually the first step of the design consists in the use of 2 D and 3 D e-m CAD’s able to characterize the single cell parameters in terms of its geometrical quantities and to study the be-haviour of many coupled cells, respectively. The usual pro-cedure foresees a full characterization only of a tank ended by half cells shorted by p. e. c. flat plates, by using the 3 D CAD output (mode frequencies) as an input for specific codes as Disper able to find out the lumped circuit param-eters of such a structure. From these values one may only calculate the frequency values for a <b>right</b> <b>termination</b> <b>of</b> the tanks, but no codes are available to check the parameters for a full-cell ended tank.
