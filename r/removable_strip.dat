50|$|The rifle's {{stock is}} made from fiberglass-reinforced {{polyamide}} 66. At the forward end is the pistol grip with an enlarged forward trigger guard completely enclosing the firing hand that allows the rifle to be operated with winter gloves. The trigger is hung permanently on the pistol grip, together with its two operating rods which run in guides past the magazine housing. Behind that is the locking catch for the stock group. Pressing this to the right will separate the receiver and stock. The magazine catch is behind the housing, {{on the underside of}} the stock. Above the housing are the two ejector openings, one of which is always covered by a <b>removable</b> <b>strip</b> of plastic. The rear of the stock forms the actual shoulder rest which contains the hammer unit and the end of the bolt path. The butt is closed by an endplate which is held in place by the rear sling swivel. This swivel is attached to a pin which pushes in across the butt and secures the plate. There is a cavity under the buttplate that holds a cleaning kit.|$|E

50|$|Analytical thermal {{desorption}} {{originated in the}} mid-1970s as an adaptation to the injection procedure for GC. Injector liners were packed with a compound able to adsorb organic compounds, used to sample air or gas, and then dropped into the inlet of the GC. This principle was first widely employed for occupational monitoring, {{in the form of}} personal badge-type monitors containing a <b>removable</b> charcoal <b>strip.</b> These offered the advantage of being amenable to analysis without a separate solvent-extraction step.|$|R
40|$|Zebrafish larvae {{are ideal}} for {{toxicology}} and drug screens due to their transparency, small size and similarity to humans on the genetic level. Using modern imaging techniques, cells and tissues can be dynamically visualised and followed over days in multiple zebrafish. Yet continued imaging experiments require specialized conditions such as: moisture and heat control to maintain specimen homeostasis. Chambers that control the environment are generally very expensive and are not always available for all imaging platforms. A highly customizable mounting configuration with built-in means of controlling temperature and media flow would therefore be a valuable tool for long term imaging experiments. Rapid prototyping using 3 D printing is particularly suitable as a production method as it offers high flexibility in design, is widely available and allows {{a high degree of}} customizing. We study neural regeneration in zebrafish. Regeneration is limited in humans, but zebrafish recover from neural damage within days. Yet, the underlying regenerative mechanisms remain unclear. We developed an agarose based mounting system that holds the embryos in defined positions along <b>removable</b> <b>strips.</b> Homeostasis and temperature control is ensured by channels circulating buffer and heated water. This allows to image up to 120 larvae simultaneously for more than two days. Its flexibility and the low-volume, high larvae ratio will allow screening of small compound libraries. Taken together, we offer a low cost, highly adaptable solution for long term in-vivo imaging...|$|R
50|$|Programmable calculators are calculators {{that can}} {{automatically}} {{carry out a}} sequence of operations under control of a stored program, much like a computer. The first programmable calculators such as the IBM CPC used punched cards or other media for program storage. Hand-held electronic calculators store programs on magnetic <b>strips,</b> <b>removable</b> read-only memory cartridges, or in battery-backed read/write memory.|$|R
40|$|Title {{and names}} of engraver, printer, and {{publisher}} below. Perspective {{view of the}} synagogue. Along the street are are various pedestrians, including a group of soldiers in formation and a horse-drawn carriage. Also known as the Kassel Synagogue, it was inaugurated on the 8 th of August, 1839, after an older synagogue had to be abandoned due to structural issues in 1827 and planning started in 1828. The architect was Albrecht Rosengarten, a Jewish German architect, (1809 - 1893), who {{at that time was}} still a student. It was the first synagogue in Germany to be built in Rundbogenstil, a Romanesque revival architectural style used widely in Germany and characterized by heavy use of romanesque arches. The jewish community of Kassel wanted a building that would be prominent but also in harmony with the existing architecture of the city. Rundbogenstil was considered a national German style, and thus the new synagogue was a symbol of Jewish assimilation in German society. Many more synagogues in Germany (and in German Jewish communities abroad) would be built in this style. From the 7 th of November, 1938, (Kristallnacht) until the 11 th of November, the synagogue was destroyed systematically. First the Torah and other easily <b>removable</b> items were <b>stripped</b> from the synagogue and destroyed, then followed by larger objects, and on the 11 th of November 1938, the city government tore down the empty, but still functioning building, and turned the lot into a parking lot. After the war, several new synagogues were built on the old location. Albrecht Rosengarten was born to a Jewish family in Kassel in 1810. In the 1830 's be began working for the city's building and planning department. He learned the craft of architecture on the job and in study trips to Paris in 1839 (where he studied under Henri Labrouste) and Rome in 1841. He was the first German Jewish architect and the first to design synagogues. He built primarily in Rundbogenstil, a Romanesque revival architectural style used widely in Germany and characterized by heavy use of romanesque arches. He later moved to Hamburg, where he built several buildings including the Kohlh√∂fen Synagogue. He died in Hamburg in 1893...|$|R
