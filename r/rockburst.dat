40|$|A {{total of}} 240 three-component {{recordings}} from 80 <b>rockbursts,</b> which occurred in various coal mines in the Ostrava-Karviná Coal Basin (Czech Republic) between 1993 and 2005, {{was used to}} examine the decrease in maximum particle velocities ui (m/s) with a scaled distance of d = d/√E (m/√J) or d/ 3 √E (m/ 3 √J) and the rate of predominant frequencies of body waves. The energetic span of <b>rockbursts</b> was within the interval of E = 6. 2 × 103 − 5. 0 × 108 J, while calculated hypocentral distances d of four underground seismic stations varied from 0. 6 to 7 km. The slopes b of regression straight lines for the maximum particle velocities ui (m/s) of P- and S-waves in the bilogarithmic scale correspond to the values of − 1. 004, − 1. 297, − 1. 183 and − 1. 527. The results of the linear regression are as follows: Pmax-waves ui = 1. 184 × 10 − 4 × d− 1. 004 (m/s) (square root scaling) Pmax-waves ui = 3. 055 × 10 − 3 × d− 1. 297 (m/s) (cube root scaling) Smax-waves ui = 5. 280 × 10 − 4 × d− 1. 183 (m/s) (square root scaling) Smax-waves ui = 2. 397 × 10 − 2 × d− 1. 527 (m/s) (cube root scaling). The evaluation of the abovementioned dynamic parameters was based on seismic events data gathered in the database of the regional seismic array, and calculations were carried out either by using special programs applied as part of the automated data processing in the computation center, or by usual linear regression approaches. The aim of the detailed analysis of the maximum particle velocity and predominant frequencies was a) to set up input data from underground seismological observations for laboratory experiments dealing with the comparison of rock mass behaviour under modeled laboratory conditions simulating manifestation of <b>rockbursts,</b> and b) to incorporate particle velocity into the design of support in order to control damage and evident devastation of workings by <b>rockbursts.</b> The investigation of peak particle velocities was based on the recognition that they are the best criterion to assess vibration damage to surface structures and in mines...|$|R

40|$|<b>Rockburst</b> {{is a kind}} of {{artificial}} earthquake induced by human activities, such as mining excavations. The mechanism of <b>rockburst</b> induced by mining disturbance is revealed in terms of energy in this context. For understanding the <b>rockburst</b> mechanism, two necessary conditions for the occurrence of <b>rockburst</b> are presented: (1) the rock mass has the capability to store huge amount of energy and possesses a strong bumping-prone characteristic when damaged; and (2) the geological conditions in the mining area have favorable geo-stress environments that can form high-stress concentration area and accumulate huge energy. These two conditions are also the basic criteria for prediction of <b>rockburst.</b> In view of energy analysis, it is observed that artificial and natural earthquakes have similar regularities in many aspects, such as the relationship between the energy value and burst magnitude.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>rockbursts</b> was quite common during active mining periods in the Champion reef mines of Kolar gold fields, India. Among the major <b>rockbursts,</b> the ‘area-rockbursts’ were unique both {{in regard to}} their spatio-temporal distribution {{and the extent of}} damage caused to the mine workings. A detailed study of the spatial clustering of 3 major area-rockbursts (ARB) was carried out using a multi-fractal technique involving generalized correlation integral functions. The spatial distribution analysis of all 3 area-rockbursts showed that they are heterogeneous. The degree of heterogeneity (D 2 – D∞) in the cases of ARB-I, II and III were found to be 0. 52, 0. 37 and 0. 41 respectively. These differences in fractal structure indicate that the ARBs of the present study were fully controlled by different heterogeneous stress fields associated with different mining and geological conditions.

The {{unpredictable}} nature, and sometimes fatal consequences of the <b>rockbursts,</b> makes identifying increases in stress that occur prior to failure events, important for mine safety. The piezoelectric, electrokinetic, and seismo-electric/magnetic effects result in rocks that are stressed emitting electric and magnetic fields that can potentially be measured in (or close to) a rock mass. Electric, magnetic and seismic data were collected during a four-day period at Coleman Mine, Sudbury, Ontario, and later analysed. No signals due to strain were evident in the magnetic or electric data, so a more careful three-part experiment was proposed to see if strain related signals could be identified in magnetic data.

The temporal frequency-magnitude distribution, b(t), of <b>rockbursts</b> in Zinkgruvan mine was examined using high quality data recorded {{during the period}} November 1996 to April 2004 with magnitude ranges from Mw= - 2. 4 to 2. 6. A sliding time-window was applied to compute b-values. The windows contain 50 events and were shifted with steps of 5 events. The results indicated that b-values significantly drop preceding <b>rockbursts</b> of magnitude Mw≥ 1. 6. Temporal and spatial variations of b-values were also examined for tectonic earthquakes, magnitude Mw≥ 4. 1, in the Andaman-Sumatra region. Earthquake data from the ISC, IDC, NEIC and HVRD earthquake catalogs for a period from 01 / 01 / 1995 to 12 / 26 / 2004 were used for analysis. Spatial variations of b were calculated from circular areas containing 50 events, with nodes on a 0. 5 ° x 0. 5 ° grid. The analysis shows that b(t) estimates using data from different catalogs are comparable and that large earthquakes are preceded by a drop in b(t) of about 0. 3 ~ 1. The distribution of stress deduced from b-value mapping shows that large earthquakes occurred in the high stress, i. e. low b-value, areas.

40|$|Induced {{seismicity}} is {{a common}} phenomenon that occurs {{as soon as the}} stress state in the subsurface is externally altered in a way that faults are destabilized. It is especially problematic in stable tectonic regions where the area is not used to earthquakes; the infrastructure is not built to withstand ground movement and thus when the induced seismicity occurs damage can follow. In this thesis, mining-induced seismicity has been studied at the Dannemora mine, located in central Sweden, with the aim to locate the seismicity and gain understanding of its occurrence and behavior. The mining company, Dannemora Mineral AB, provided with blasting locations and times, as well as maps over the mine's orebodies and stopes. Seismic data acquired between 01 July 2014 - 25 March 2015 from 4 temporary seismic stations, deployed in the summer of 2014 surrounding the mine, along with 8 SNSN stations was analyzed. The project encompassed field work and processing of the data, which involved different methods to investigate the characteristics of the mine's seismicity: Statistics were kept to record the activity rate of the seismicity over time; spectral analysis was used to study the frequency content of the seismicity; particle motion plots were constructed to identify body-phases in the seismicity; Local Earthquake Tomography was used to upgrade the velocity model of the mine and to relocate the induced seismicity with more accuracy; cross-correlation was used to find events originating from similar sources; and finally, magnitude analysis was used to compare the different types of seismicity within the mine. Three main types of induced events were observed in the mine: low-frequency events with clear first arrivals, emergent events with long duration, and high-frequency events that could either have clear first arrivals or emergent-like with long durations. Through the analysis of their characteristics, they were linked to different types of <b>rockbursts.</b> The low-frequency events were linked to both reactivation of fault zones triggered by the mine activity, and <b>rockbursts</b> within the mine directly related to the mining. The emergent and high-frequency events were also linked to <b>rockbursts</b> directly related to the mine activity, e. g. ejection of rock from the tunnel walls or arch collapses in stopes...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{determine}} maximum stress due to seismic waves propagation through the rock mass. For this determination, rock density, velocity of seismic waves propagation vp and vs and ground amplitudes were introduced. For the evaluation data recorded at 3 underground seismic station from the time period 1993 - 2002 were used. To this set of data only <b>rockbursts</b> with some consequences in mine were included. Based on these analyses, predominant frequencies of seismic P and S waves, dependences of ground amplitudes to scaled distance and stress at the head of seismic wave were calculated...|$|R
