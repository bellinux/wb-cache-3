This article considers the role of ventilation in preventing and controlling infection in hospital general wards and identifies a simple and cost-effective ventilation design capable of reducing the chances of cross-infection. Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis is used to simulate and compare the removal of microbes using {{a number of different}} ventilation systems. Instead of the conventional corridor air <b>return</b> <b>arrangement</b> used in most general wards, air return is rearranged so that ventilation is controlled from inside the ward cubicle. In addition to boosting the air ventilation rate, the CFD results reveal that ventilation performance and the removal of microbes can be significantly improved. These improvements are capable of matching the standards maintained in a properly constructed isolation room, though at much lower cost. It is recommended that the newly identified ventilation parameters be widely adopted in the design of new hospital general wards to minimise cross-infection. The proposed ventilation system can also be retrofitted in existing hospital general wards with far less disruption and cost than a full-scale refurbishment.

50|$|By far {{the most}} common outcome for {{separated}} children is a grant of discretionary leave to remain. Discretionary leave to remain is provided most frequently when there are inadequate <b>return</b> <b>arrangements</b> for these children in their country of origin. This leave to remain is usually granted for three years or until the young person reaches 17 ½, whichever is sooner. The child may appeal if he thinks {{he should have been}} granted refugee status or humanitarian protection, but only if he was initially granted more than twelve months’ leave. It should be noted that both grants of humanitarian protection and of discretionary leave are still rejection of asylum claims, so the young people granted either of these have the right to appeal this decision.|$|R

When slurry pH rose above the desired set point (pH 7.0) the control valve connected to the flue gas would open, allowing flue gas to be introduced to the feed tank. When the pH dropped below the set point, the flue gas control valve would close and another control valve would open, allowing air in the head space to be recirculated, preventing CO 2 in the head space from venting from the system. The third control valve {{was used as a}} relief valve to prevent the feed tank from becoming pressurized as flue gas was added to the system. In this manner, as CO 2 was consumed by the algae, additional CO 2 was automatically fed into the system as needed to maintain the desired operating pH.|$|R

After Hare threatened to expel him from the team, Brooks lost his temper and pinned the manager against the wall. The swimmer was summoned to a meeting with ASU officials the following day, where he remained unrepentant. He received a one-month ban, effective after the conclusion of the Commonwealth Games. Brooks demanded that if the ASU were to suspend him, they should do so immediately for the Commonwealth Games, rather than letting him compete and win medals before punishing him. His complaints about the training conditions had gained the attention of his team-mates, and several senior swimmers threatened to leave if he was banned. In the end, the ASU rescinded the suspension. Brooks has remained strongly critical of the attitude of swimming bureaucracy, claiming that [...] "too many officials expect unquestioning obedience", calling for the formation of a swimmers' committee.|$|R

40|$|Given a slice regular {{function}} f:Ω⊂H→H, with Ω∩R≠∅, it {{is possible}} to lift it to a surface in the twistor space CP^ 3 of S^ 4 ≃H∪{∞} (see gensalsto). In this paper we show that the same result is true if one removes the hypothesis Ω∩R≠∅ on the domain of the function f. Moreover we find that if a surface S⊂CP^ 3 contains the image of the twistor lift of a slice regular function, then S has to be ruled by lines. Starting from these results we find all the projective classes of algebraic surfaces up to degree 3 in CP^ 3 that contain the lift of a slice regular function. In addition we extend and further explore the so-called twistor transform, that is a curve in Gr_ 2 (C^ 4) which, given a slice regular function, <b>returns</b> the <b>arrangement</b> of lines whose lift carries on. With the explicit expression of the twistor lift and of the twistor transform of a slice regular function we exhibit the set of slice regular functions whose twistor transform describes a rational line inside Gr_ 2 (C^ 4), showing the role of slice regular functions not defined on R. At the end we study the twistor lift of a particular slice regular function not defined over the reals. This example shows the effectiveness of our approach and opens some questions.

This article explores the nature of the relationships that exist between young people living in such households. First, using Maffesoli’s concept of ‘neo-tribalism’, the article explores the importance of proximity, shared space (both real and symbolic) and ritual to the everyday framing of relationships in peer-shared households. Second, the article considers the conditions under which some shared households may move beyond neo-tribalism to take on the characteristics of ‘quasi-communes’, marked by the institutionalization of friendship within a domestic setting. The article draws on empirical research involving 25 shared households in the south of England...|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to generating, evaluating, and optimizing general arrangements of naval surface ships is presented. Beginning from a user editable database of spaces, the algorithms <b>return</b> an optimized <b>arrangement.</b> The user drives the design by quantitatively defining spaces’ goals and constraints for location, proximity, and shape. The arrangements task is undertaken in two parts: Allocation and Arrangement. Allocation is the assignment of a space to a region of a ship. The unit region used is dubbed a Zone-deck. The Zone-deck is the intersection of one deck and one watertight subdivision. The allocation solution evaluates Zone-deck area utilization and spaces’ relative and global position goals. Adjacency and separation distance between spaces is measured in increments of deck and subdivision. Global position is assessed by deck and subdivision. Each discrete distance and position has an editable default fuzzy preference value. Allocation is essentially a very large scale combinatorial bin packing problem. With the added complexity of relative location constraints, this also becomes a type of quadratic assignment problem. The independent variable vector is an ordered listing by space index number of each space’s assigned Zonedeck index number. A customized Genetic Algorithm optimizes the integer-coded chromosome. The second part arranges one Zone-deck at a time. Arrangement is done in two iterative steps: topology and geometry. Topology gives the relative longitudinal and transverse position of each space’s seed location. These locations are translated onto an orthogonal grid. In the second step, spaces are expanded to have size and shape filling the available area in the stochastic growth loop. Spaces are defined by up to three contiguous boxes allowing for L, T, C and Z shapes. The arrangement cost function evaluates each space’s required area satisfaction, aspect ratio, minimum overall dimension, minimum segment dimension, perimeter, connectivity to access, and proximity constraints to other spaces. Editable piecewise linear fuzzy utility functions translate each criteria measure to a fuzzy utility. The best of a modest number of geometry solutions returns joiner bulkhead locations and a cost function value to a Genetic Algorithm optimization of the topology chromosome...|$|R
