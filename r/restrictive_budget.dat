Recent progress in miniaturized space system technologies may {{make it possible for}} nanosatellites to complement today's large, extremely high reliability, single mission satellites with smaller, less costly platforms that greatly reduce development, integration, and launch timelines. To fully realize this transition, Academia and Industry must make additional technological advances in all supporting satellite subsystems. This thesis focuses on the design, simulation, and hardware testing of a nanosatellite electrical power subsystem. Thesis efforts centered on investigating the feasibility of using commercial off the shelf power management and distribution systems in a CubeSat-based design for a tactically useful earth-imaging satellite. Criteria were developed to select one power system from among those considered. Extensive analytical simulation, electrical testing, and environmental testing was conducted in the context of TINYSCOPE's mission parameters.

40|$|Abstract-Many {{emergency}} response units are currently faced with <b>restrictive</b> <b>budgets</b> which prohibit {{their use of}} technology both in training and in real-world situations. Our work focuses on creating an affordable, mobile, state-of-the-art {{emergency response}} test-bed through the integration of low-cost, com-mercially available products. We have developed a command, control, communications, surveillance and reconnaissance system that will allow small-unit exercises to be tracked and recorded for evaluation purposes. Our system can be used for military and first responder training providing the nexus for decision making through the use of computational models, advanced technology, situational awareness and command and control. During a training session, data is streamed back to a central repository allowing commanders to evaluate their squads in a live action setting and assess their effectiveness in an after-action review. In order to effectively analyze this data, an interactive visualization system has been designed in which commanders can track personnel movement, view surveillance feeds, listen to radio traffic, and fast-forward/rewind event sequences. This system provides both 2 -D and 3 -D views of the environment while showing previously traveled paths, responder orientation and activity level. Both stationary and personnel-worn mobile camera video feeds may be displayed, as well as the associated radio traffic. I...|$|R

Fixed- and variable-interval terminal-link water schedules reinforced choice between equal variable-interval initial-link schedules arranged on two pecking keys. While keeping a severely <b>restrictive</b> <b>budget</b> the same across three phases of the experiment, a contrasting distinct ample budget was arranged in each. To mimic typical methods in behavioral ecology studies, in each ample budget a more than three-fold increase in amount of water per reinforcer presentation was instituted simultaneously with significantly increased overall access to water. Total choice response rates plummeted in the ample budgets, and body weights either increased significantly or remained unchanged in different phases as expected {{by the nature of}} the different manipulations. Clear preferences for the variable-interval schedule were found throughout the experiment, except for rare instances of key bias.

40|$|Background: Public-Private Partnerships for product {{development}} (PD PPPs) {{have been developed}} as a major initiative {{to increase the number}} of innovative interventions for diseases mainly affecting populations in developing countries. Their development and funding have been supported by a number of donors, who are also interested in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of PD PPs in comparison with other uses of donor expenditure such as increased support for existing programmes. Methods: Evaluating the cost-effectiveness of PD PPPs raises a number of methodological and empirical problems. First, the costs and likely product outcomes of the PD PPP process must be simulated by drug or vaccine and by disease area. Second, an efficiency frontier of existing therapies must be constructed, to estimate the potential yield of shifting that frontier via PD PPP investment versus moving up the existing frontier. Third, the cost-effectiveness of PD PPP investment depends in part on the likely demand for products of the PD PPP process, based on the expected quality of PD PPP products, willingness to pay for health gain, budget constraints and disease burden. Ideally a cost-effectiveness frontier can be constructed empirically by collecting evidence on the total costs and effects of a full set of existing interventions, and we demonstrate this for one <b>restrictive</b> <b>budget</b> scenario. However, for two other scenarios we consider, such information is not readily available, and we have to use a simplifying assumption. We show that it is possible to make a simplifying assumption about the cost-effectiveness of the intervention(s) that will be displaced from other disease budgets to fund the new technology - that is, the "opportunity cost" of funding the new technology. The assumption we adopt is that the cost per DALY averted of the healthcare programmes being displaced will on average have a slope equivalent to a straight line at the midpoint between the cost-effectiveness of the new technology and the maximum willingness to pay for health gain: the maximum willingness to pay will signal the cost-effectiveness of the last acceptable intervention within the budget constraint if resources were all allocated using cost-effectiveness criteria. Results: Using our model we estimate the cost per DALY averted for a range of HIV, TB and Malaria drugs and vaccines in the PD PPP programme. In gneeral these compare favourably with existing interventions but some are subject to significant uncertainty, particularly relating to the underlying R&D process for vaccines compared to drugs. Conclusions: This study offers a framework to assess the cost-effectiveness of providing additional resources to tackle major health problems in developing countries, using the example of investment in R&D via PD PPP mechanisms compared with investment in existing interventions. The results suggest that trying to shift the cost-effectiveness frontier may be a cost-effective use of resources. The methods used to reach this results should be generalisable to other interventions...|$|E
40|$|The {{significant}} {{effects of the}} building industry on the natural environment are well documented and improving the environmental performance of buildings is an on-going challenge. This is particularly the case for projects with <b>restrictive</b> <b>budgets</b> and timelines and because many existing environmental assessment tools {{are designed to be}} used too late in the design process. The use of tools during the early design stages may assist in achieving greater improvements in a building’s environmental performance. However, user-friendly tools with the ability to comprehensively compare environmental information between various building assemblies and materials, which can be easily adopted during the early design stages of a project, are not readily available. This paper presents the progress to date in developing a tool which supports building designers in identifying and selecting preferred building assemblies with the aim of minimising a building’s life cycle energy demand. The tool is based on comprehensive energy performance data for a broad range of building assemblies across all Australian climate zones. Allowing for adjustments to a set of pre-defined and user-defined assemblies the designer is able to see how assemblies perform in relation to each other. This provides valuable information to support decision-making relating to minimising the life cycle energy demand of buildings...|$|R

40|$|Falta palabras claveNowadays {{health care}} {{organizations}} experience an increasing pressure {{in order to}} provide their services at the lowest possible costs {{as a response to the}} combination of <b>restrictive</b> <b>budgets,</b> increasing waiting lists, and the aging of the population. In general, hospital resources are expensive and scarce, being the operating theatre the most critical and expensive resource. In most hospitals, the operating theatre is a complex system composed of operating rooms (ORs) together with their specialized equipment, preoperative and postoperative facilities and, finally, a diversity of human resources, including surgeons, anesthetists, nurses, etc. To handle such complexity, decisions related to operating theatre management are usually decomposed into three hierarchical decision levels, i. e. : strategic, tactical and operational. At the strategic level, hospital managers set the volume and the mix of surgeries that will be performed over a long-term horizon (typically, a year) to keep up acceptable size of waiting lists while achieving cost targets, thus making long-term decisions related to the dimensioning of surgical facilities (e. g. build new ORs, adding new recovery beds, etc.), the hiring of surgical staff (e. g. surgeons, nurses, etc.), the purchase of novel surgical devices, and the amount of operating theatre resources required by surgical specialties to perform their surgeries (OR time, number of beds, etc.). Once decisions at strategic level have been made, the operating theatre resources are allocated over a medium-term planning horizon (ranging from few weeks to 6 months) in the tactical level. Since the OR is both a bottleneck and the most expensive facility for most hospitals, surgical specialties are first assigned to OR days (i. e. a pair of an OR and a day) over the planning horizon, until the OR time allocated to each surgical specialty in the strategic level is reached. Then, the above assignment defines aggregate resource requirements for specialties, such as the demand of nurses, drugs, diagnostic procedures, laboratory tests, etc. Finally, the working shifts of human resources and their workload (e. g. the number of surgeries allocated to each surgeon) are defined over the medium-term planning horizon in order to achieve the volume of surgeries set by hospital managers. Finally, the surgical schedule is determined over a short-term planning horizon (ranging from few days to few weeks) at the operational level. The operational level is usually solved into two steps. The first step involves the determination of the date and the OR for a set of surgeries in the waiting list; while in the second step, a sequence of surgeries for each OR within each day in the planning horizon is obtained. Note that only a set of surgeries will be performed during the planning horizon due to capacity constraints (both facilities and human resources). The decomposition of the operational level into the two aforementioned steps intends to reduce the complexity of the resulting problem, although the quality of the so-obtained surgery schedule may be reduced due to the high interdependence among these two steps, being the integrated approach a popular topic of research. At the operational level, a feature greatly influencing the performance is the uncertainty in the surgical activities, as frequently large discrepancies between the scheduled duration and the real duration of the surgeries appear, together with the availability of the resources reserved for emergency arrivals. Despite the importance and the complexity of these hierarchical levels, decisions in practice are usually made according to the decision makers’ experience without considering the underlying optimization problems. Furthermore, the lack of usage of decision models and solution procedures causes the decision makers to consume long times on performing management tasks (e. g. determine the surgical schedule, react to unforeseen events, carry out what-if analyses, etc.), instead of healthcare tasks. The context discussed above stresses the need to provide healthcare decision makers with advanced operations research techniques (i. e. models and solution procedures) in order to improve the efficiency of the operating theatre resources and the quality of the healthcare services at the operational level.

40|$|Background Globalization and {{profitable}} health (cost/benefit) requires pharmacoeconomic {{evaluation of the}} costs in relation to effectiveness of the methods of treatment. The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the cumulative costs of anesthesia in all surgical disciplines using the Activity-Based Costing (ABC) analysis. Methods This work is a part of Phase IV clinical study. Retrospectively, for 2006, direct costs of anesthesia services were calculated: (1) personnel costs (salaries), (2) drugs and supplies, (3) other costs (analysis and apparatus) in the Institute of Anesthesiology and Resuscitation, Clinical Center of Serbia. The research group included all anesthetized patients of both genders and ofall ages. Summary data documented in the anesthesia department and databases of the Clinical Center of Serbia and the Republic Institute of Health Insurance were used. Numerical data were calculated and analyzed by computer programs Microsoft Office Excel 2003 and SPSS for Windows. Results The results of direct costs showed that personnel costs accounted for 40 %, medicines and supplies - 31. 80 % and other costs - 28. 20 % of the funds. Anesthesia costs accounted for 10 % (ABC analysis) of direct costs. Methodological dilemmas were related to the inaccuracy of anesthetic and surgical protocols, the classification of anesthetic and surgical services and the imperfection of computer data entry software. Basic hospital activities information should be more specific and precise. Clinical protocols of the anesthetized patients should be connected better with the Admission department, Intensive care units, Day surgical hospital and other departments. Database of the clinical drug pathway, Clinical protocols, Accounting Information Systems, and Hospital Management Information Systems should be precise, specific and managed in a better way. Conclusions The costs of local and general anesthesia procedures are objectively low and numerous, what may be objectified by this pharmacoeconomic analysis. Those insufficiently informed call for 'rationalization'. The costs of drugs and supplies are real while all other costs are agreed upon, and accordingly, there is no possibility of cutting down the expenses within so small and <b>restrictive</b> health <b>budget.</b> The change of budget dynamics and education of control staff could be helpful...|$|R

The Internet enables consumers to access a global range of products, which are delivered directly to their own homes, and all {{within the confines of}} their own home. We have chosen to investigate students in a middle-size town as a consumer group. Students are a particularly interesting consumer group due to the facts that they have unique conditions in their day-to-day consumption. Young age, a <b>restrictive</b> monthly <b>budget</b> and relatively well educated in the use of internet are characteristics that can attributed to most students, and are of great significance in regard to the buying process on the internet. With this in mind we have shaped a purpose for this essay. The purpose of this essay is to broaden our understanding of students’ preparations before conducting a purchase on the Internet, this will be achieved through studying students buying behavior. The study shall also aim at broadening the seller’s knowledge of consumer preferences on the Internet in regard to how they prepare for a upcoming purchase. The result will highlight the problem definition and will be put into perspective with the entire buying process. The theories, which shall lie as the foundation for the analysis of our investigation, are drawn from results of past studies within the research area. In addition we will include established theories within marketing in order to put our own research in a broader context. The study is conducted in a deductive method and we also describe it as comparative as we will relate our results to the results of past studies within the same research area. The main conclusions of this study are:- Student preparation for purchases on the Internet is highly based on past experience and personal preference. - Student preparation for purchases on the Internet is done within and outside of the Internet. - Students associate purchases on the Internet with positive and negative feelings. - The positive associations can lead to impulse purchases of related products.

At the age of eleven he moved to Northfleet Technology College and continued {{to play for the}} Gravesham Schools FA at secondary school level. [...] At the age of fifteen he began his professional career at his local club Gravesend and Northfleet (later known as Ebbsfleet United) which at that time competed in the Conference National. Moore spent two years playing for the youth team whilst taking part in the club's Programme for Academic and Sporting Excellence, a nationwide scheme which aims to develop young footballers on the pitch whilst also ensuring they remain in higher education. On 6 February 2006 he scored in a 2–0 win over Dover Athletic in the Kent Senior Cup, earning the 17-year–old special praise from first team manager Liam Daish. Moore was rewarded with his first professional contract on 1 July 2006. The forward made his league debut on 15 August 2006 in a 4–1 win over Tamworth. He scored his first goal in professional football on 26 August 2006, securing a 1–0 win over Forest Green Rovers. He continued his good form by scoring twice more in the following two games; the first coming in a 3–1 win over Altrincham on 28 August 2006 and the second in a 2–2 draw with Southport on 2 September 2006. He scored 7 goals in 37 appearances for Ebbsfleet United during his debut season at the club. In November 2007, Ebbsfleet United was taken over by MyFootballClub. Moore further cemented his place in the first team in the 2007–08 season, making 44 league appearances and scoring 7 goals. During this season, he also achieved FA Trophy success, playing in the 2008 FA Trophy Final against Torquay United, which ended as a 1–0 victory to Ebbsfleet United, on 10 May 2008 in front of a crowd of 40,186 at Wembley Stadium. The 2008–09 season was Moore's last for Ebbsfleet United. He made 36 league appearances in which he scored 6 goals. He scored his 20th and last league goal for Ebbsfleet United in a 2–1 win over Crawley Town on 20 November 2008. At the end of the 2008–09 season, Ebbsfleet United manager Liam Daish was forced to disband the squad due to financial issues at the club which resulted in a much more <b>restrictive</b> playing <b>budget</b> for the following season.|$|R
