40|$|Based on {{very high}} {{resolution}} satellite images, object-based classification methods {{can be used}} to produce large scale maps for forest management. These new products require a method to derive quantitative information about the accuracy and precision of delineated boundaries. This assessment would complement any measure of thematic accuracy derived from the confusion matrix. This study aims to assess the positional quality of the boundaries between different landscape units produced by automated segmentation of IKONOS and SPOT- 5 satellite images over temperate forests. A robust method was developed to assess the accuracy and the precision of the forest boundaries, respectively measured by the bias and the standard deviation. The two main sources of positional error, namely <b>residual</b> <b>parallax</b> and automatic segmentation, were independently assessed. Positional errors caused by the <b>residual</b> <b>parallax</b> were quantified using a 3 D model. Forest stand boundaries generated by automatic segmentation were compared to corresponding visual delineations. The results showed that <b>residual</b> <b>parallax</b> was the major source of positive bias (area overestimation) along forest/non-forest boundaries and depended on the interactions between forest stand patterns and sensor viewing angles. Due mainly to tree shade, the automatic segmentation also produced a positive bias on forest areas, which remained under I in for both IKONOS- 2 and SPOT- 5 images. Standard deviation did not increase linearly with pixel size and was influenced {{by the nature of the}} boundary. Production of 1 : 20, 000 scale forest maps from very high resolution satellite data clearly requires acquisition of near nadir imagery or knowledge of landscape object height for true orthorectification. In these cases, IKONOS- 2 segmentation outputs were found to correspond with 1 : 20, 000 scale map specification, and SPOT- 5 imagery with 1 : 30, 000 scale. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Abstract — Creating an {{obstacle}} detection system {{is an important}} challenge to improve safety for road vehicles. A way to meet the industrial cost requirements is to gather a monocular vision sensor. This paper tackles this problem and defines an highly parallelisable image motion segmentation method for {{taking into account the}} current evolution of multi processor computer technology. A complete and modular solution is proposed, based on the Tensor Voting framework extended to the 4 D space (x, y, dx, dy), where surfaces describe homogeneous moving areas in the image plan. Watershed segmentation is applied on the result to obtain closed boundaries. Cells are then clustered and labeled with respect to planar parallax rigidity constraints. A visual odometry method, based on texture learning and tracking, is used to estimate <b>residual</b> <b>parallax</b> displacement. I...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{computing}} the 3 D camera motion (the egomotion) in a static scene is described, where initially a detected 2 D motion between two frames {{is used to}} align corresponding image regions. We prove that such a 2 D registration removes all e ects of camera rotation, even for those image regions that remain misaligned. The resulting <b>residual</b> <b>parallax</b> displacement eld between the two region-aligned images is an epipolar eld centered at the FOE (Focus-of-Expansion). The 3 D camera translation is recovered from the epipolar eld. The 3 D camera rotation is recovered from the computed 3 D translation and the detected 2 D motion. The decomposition of image motion into a 2 D parametric motion and residual epipolar parallax displacements avoids many of the inherent ambiguities and instabilities associated with decomposing the image motion into its rotational and translational components, and hence makes the computation of ego-motion or 3 D structure estimation more robust.

40|$|The paper {{concerns}} selected {{results from}} a vast Italian research project regarding calibration of GPS/IMU systems {{and the quality of}} direct georeferencing in photogrammetry. Thanks to Pavia's Test Site (PTS) and to a complex structure of flight data which was acquired above it, it is possible to perform rigorous and independent validation of results. This means: the possibility of calibrating on one flight and validating on another, totally independent; the usage of disjoint sets of points for calibration and for assessing the results of direct georeferencing. The present paper illustrates selected results from the Project. The attainable accuracy is assessed, as a function of flight height, focal length and orientation methodology: directly measured exterior orientations and adjusted ones, calculated with or without the use of GCPs. <b>Residual</b> <b>parallaxes</b> are also estimated. Two-step system calibration, with three or six parameters, is investigated. Short-term time stability of the calibration of the GPS/IMU system and of interior orientation of the camera is assessed. The size and the effects of some systematic errors are estimated, such as time-recording delays, incorrect values for PPA and focal length. 1...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} one of {{the first}} outcomes of an Italian national research Project on inertial positioning in photogrammetry. The focus of the paper is on the quality which is attainable from direct photogrammetry in an industrial production context. Even if GPS/IMU-aided photogrammetry is used rather widely, it is still useful to perform rigorous quality assessment of this method, because large and diverse case studies are necessary to prove and quantify the capability of a new methodology. Besides, it is necessary to evaluate such methodology in the ordinary operational conditions, rather than considering data acquired in a dedicated, special context. To fulfil these requirements several different flights were considered, which were acquired by an Italian photogrammetric company before the beginning of the Project, purely for production aims, and rigorous quantification of <b>residual</b> <b>parallaxes</b> and accuracy was performed. The origin of the considered data, which is not research-oriented, and the vast and heterogeneous case study – different cities, different flights, different calibrations- make the described test very significant and reliable. 1...|$|R
40|$|I {{review the}} astrophysical {{insights}} arising from high-precision astrometric observations of X-ray binary systems, focussing primarily (but not exclusively) on recent results with very long baseline interferometry. Accurate, model-independent distances from geometric parallax measurements can help determine physical {{parameters of the}} host binary system and constrain black hole spins via broadband X-ray spectral modelling. Long-term proper motion studies, combined with binary evolution calculations, can provide observational constraints on the formation mechanism of black holes. Finally, the astrometric <b>residuals</b> from <b>parallax</b> and proper motion fits can provide information on orbital sizes and jet physics. I end by discussing prospects for future progress in this field. Comment: 17 pages, 3 tables, 4 figures.

40|$|Given two {{arbitrary}} {{views of}} a scene under central projection, if the motion of points on a parametric surface is compensated, the <b>residual</b> <b>parallax</b> displacement field on the reference image is an epipolar field. If the surface aligned is a plane, the parallax magnitude at an image point is directly proportional to {{the height of the}} point from the plane and inversely proportional to its depth from the camera. We exploit the above theorem to infer 3 D height information from oblique aerial 2 D images. We use direct methods to register the aerial images, develop methods to infer heightinformation under the following three conditions: (i) focal length and image center are both known, (ii) only the focal length is known, and (iii) both are unknown. 1 Introduction Traditional methods in motion analysis have expressed the image motion of rigid bodies as a sum of two image displacement fields: a rotation field and a epipolar (translation) field.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{computing}} the 3 D camera motion (the egomotion) in a static scene is introduced, {{which is based}} on initially computing the 2 D image motion of an image region. The computed dominant 2 D parametric motion between two frames is used to register the images so that the corresponding image region appears perfectly aligned between the two registered frames. Such 2 D parametric registration removes all e ects of camera rotation, even for the misaligned image regions. The resulting <b>residual</b> <b>parallax</b> displacement eld between the two region-aligned images is an epipolar eld centered at the FOE (Focus-of-Expansion).

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the influence of ground control points (GCPs) on the aerial triangulation of datasets acquired using a Leica ADS 40. The ADS 40 comprises seven parallel linear sensors in the focal plane of a single lens system. Three panchromatic sensors scan the same ground area at different angles to acquire forward, nadir and backward scenes. After the raw imagery and metadata are downloaded, determination of exterior orientation parameters and subsequent image rectification enable stereo viewing in three possible geometric combinations. <b>Residual</b> <b>parallax</b> in the rectified data, however, means bundle adjustment is necessary before the maximum photogrammetric accuracy can be achieved. In order to assess the influence of bundle adjustment, a dataset of ADS 40 imagery was acquired for an 8 x 8 km study area around Waldkirch in Switzerland. The dataset consists of four adjacent strips of ADS 40 imagery plus two cross strips scanned by each of the sensor’s seven channels. The ADS 40 imagery of the study area was pre-processed, rectified and triangulated interactively using the ADS 40 ground processing software GPro, the SOCET SET ® photogrammetric software suite and the ORIMA bundle adjustment software. Repeated triangulation of the dataset in different configurations of strips, scenes and GCPs was applied. The number of GCPs was increased gradually in different arrangements to assess the influences on the triangulation process and analyse the need for GCPs when using GPS/IMU data. Based on the findings, recommendations are made as to the most suitable block configuration to be selected when using data of this kind. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} a specific problem of visual perception of motion, namely {{the problem of}} visual detection of independent 3 D motion. Most of the existing techniques for solving this problem rely on restrictive assumptions about the environment, the observer's motion, or both. Moreover, {{they are based on}} the computation of a dense optical flow field, which amounts to solving the illposed correspondence problem. In this work, independent motion detection is formulated as a problem of robust parameter estimation applied to the visual input acquired by a rigidly moving observer. The proposed method automatically selects a planar surface in the scene and the <b>residual</b> planar <b>parallax</b> normal flow field with respect to the motion of this surface is computed at two successive time instants. The two resulting normal flow fields are then combined in a linear model. The parameters of this model are related to the parameters of self-motion (egomotion) and their robust estimation leads to a segm [...] ...|$|R

By the shared-use of motion vectors with a video encoder, the computational cost for motion estimation using optical flow method can be saved, making the system more cost effective.

40|$|Large scale vector {{databases}} {{are valued}} tools for forest management. It is therefore {{important to keep}} these databases up to date and various change detection methods have been designed in this aim. Recently, object-based iterative trimming was successfully used to detect change in temperate and tropical forests. The goal {{of the present study}} is to transfer this image-to-image method in an imageto-map application. This study focuses on the detection of clear cuts and forest regeneration areas in a multi-spectral Quickbird image. Various steps were necessary {{to bridge the gap between}} this image and the vector database. In order to reduce the effects of <b>residual</b> <b>parallax,</b> the vector database was modified along forest boundaries using the viewing parameters of the satellite. Besides, the image was segmented with a large homogeneity constraint in order to produce ”pure ” image-objects. Eventually, the resulting image-objects were automatically labeled using the information from the modified vector database, and the trimming algorithm was run for each forest class. The hypothesis behind iterative trimming is that objects belonging to the same class share similar characteristics (e. g. spectral reflectance). In other words, they belong to the same distribution. The class distribution was estimated using a non parametric method in order to fit to the data even with complex distributions. The chosen method used kernel density estimates to build the probability density function. Outliers were excluded based on a density threshold and the new parameters of the distribution were reprocessed until the all objects are above the new threshold. The resulting outliers included the majority of the discrepancies between the image and the map in the forest areas. About 50 % of the forest regeneration and 100 % of the clear cuts were properly detected. It is a promising way to improve semi-automated map updating because the training dataset is the vector database itself. However, further work is needed t...|$|E
