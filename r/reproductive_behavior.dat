5|$|The pygmy slow loris mates {{once every}} 12â€“18 months and has {{one or two}} {{offspring}} after an average gestation period of six months. For the first few days, the young loris clings to the belly of its mother. After six months the baby will be weaned, the females reach sexual maturity by 16 months, while the male reaches maturity by about 18 months. The pygmy slow loris is seasonally fertile during the months of July and August. Chemical signals {{play a role in}} the <b>reproductive</b> <b>behavior</b> of female pygmy slow lorises. Urine scent markings have a strong characteristic odor and are used to communication information about social relationships.|$|E
5|$|Whether Smilodon {{was sexually}} dimorphic has {{implications}} for its <b>reproductive</b> <b>behavior.</b> Based on their conclusions that Smilodon fatalis had no sexual dimorphism, Van Valkenburgh and Sacco (2002) suggested that, if the cats were social, they would likely have lived in monogamous pairs (along with offspring) with no intense competition among males for females. Likewise, Meachen-Samuels and Binder (2010) concluded that aggression between males was less pronounced in S.fatalis than in the American lion. Christiansen and Harris (2012) found that, as S.fatalis did exhibit some sexual dimorphism, {{there would have been}} evolutionary selection for competition between males. The structure of the hyoid bones suggest that Smilodon communicated by roaring, like modern big cats.|$|E
5|$|Despite being mostly solitary, {{sirenians}} congregate {{in groups}} while females are in estrus. These groups usually include one female with multiple males. Sirenians are K-selectors, so, despite the longevity, females give birth {{only a few}} times during their life and invest considerable parental care in their young. Dugongs generally gather in groups of less than a dozen individuals for one to two days. Since they congregate in turbid waters, little is known about their <b>reproductive</b> <b>behavior.</b> The males are often seen with scars, and the tusks on dugongs grow in first for males, suggesting they are important in lekking. They have also been known to lunge at each other. The age when a female first gives birth is disputed, ranging anywhere from six to seventeen years. The time between births is unclear, with estimates ranging from 2 to 7 years. Manatees can reach sexual maturity as early as two to five years of age. Manatee gestation length is around one year, and then they lactate for one to two years. West Indian manatees and African manatees can breed year-round, and a female will mate with multiple male partners. Amazonian manatees have a breeding season, usually mating when the river levels begin to rise, which varies from place to place.|$|E

25|$|Though {{colonies of}} V. pensylvanica are {{generally}} monogynous and annual, polygyny and overwintering {{has been observed}} in non-native regions, specifically in Hawaii. The relaxation of the climate and climate-related constraints {{are believed to have}} contributed to the emergence of polygyny, and polygyny is a prerequisite for successful overwintering. Generally, climate is a constraining factor in the <b>reproductive</b> <b>behavior</b> of V. pensylvanica. When temperatures drop, food availability decreases and colony decline occurs. In Hawaii, however, this does not occur.|$|E

In the present study, by setting {{up a series of}} experiments, we studied the reproductive behavioral responses of male rose bitterlings to an increasing OSR. Specifically, we tested whether male rose bitterlings would employ similar alternative <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviors</b> as the European bitterling does and what the potential evolutionary consequences would be.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, the <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviors</b> of male rose {{bitterling}} {{are influenced}} by male-biased OSR. Decreased leading behavior and increased aggression and preoviposition ejaculation are two alternative responses {{in the face of}} an increasing OSR, which is a more straightforward strategy for facing an increased risk of sperm competition than that adopted by its congener, the European bitterling. This study provides strong evidence that male-biased OSR has an important effect on male <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviors.</b> It has very important significance for better understanding of animal mating strategies.|$|R

25|$|The western yellowjacket (Vespula pensylvanica) is a Nearctic {{species of}} wasp in the genus Vespula. It {{is native to}} regions of North America, largely in areas with {{northern}} temperate climates. Its <b>reproductive</b> <b>behavior</b> is constrained by cold weather, which successfully reduces the number of western yellowjackets in cold months. However, {{in the absence of}} cold weather, this wasp's population can explode. The western yellowjacket has become particularly invasive in the Hawaiian Islands, resulting in their label as a major pest.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other forms}} of neutering, vasectomy and tubal {{ligation}} eliminate the ability to produce offspring. They differ from neutering in that they leave the animal's levels and patterns of sex hormone unchanged. Both sexes will retain their normal <b>reproductive</b> <b>behavior,</b> and other than birth control, none of {{the advantages and disadvantages}} listed above apply. This method is favored by some people who seek minimal infringement on the natural state of companion animals to achieve the desired reduction of unwanted births of cats and dogs.|$|E
25|$|According to kin {{selection}} theory, relatedness {{is extremely}} important in <b>reproductive</b> <b>behavior.</b> This is because by favoring offspring that are close relatives, this individual can {{increase the likelihood of}} its genes being passed into the next generation. Like most Vespula wasps, V. acadica has high effective paternity(>2). This derived trait is the measure of queen mating frequency, and it also takes into account the use of sperm. Evidence indicates that the opportunity for multiple matings is present for V. acadica, even though the queens do not participate in these matings.|$|E

On the other hand, there is a great reduction in population in many countries which requires a comprehensive policy to manage the considerable drop in population. To achieve this goal, initially, the factors affecting fertility must be precisely identified. This study aims to examine the role of marriage patterns in childbearing. In this cross-sectional quantitative study, 880 married women 15 - 49 years old, living in the north of Iran were studied using a cluster sampling strategy. The results showed that there are no significant differences in <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviors</b> of three patterns of marriage in Bobol city of Iran.

500|$|Stebbins' {{early work}} with lizards in the {{southern}} California desert led {{to a series of}} papers from the 1950s through the 1970s exploring the parietal eye of reptiles (also called the [...] "third eye", a tiny light-sensitive organ on the forehead) and the associated pineal gland, both of which are now known to influence circadian rhythms. Aided by a Senior Postdoctoral Fellowship from the National Science Foundation, Stebbins and colleagues found that lizards with the parietal eye surgically removed changed their behavior: they became active much earlier in the day, spent more time in the sun, and remained active much later than control lizards. Further studies over the next few decades focused on the parietal eye of the tuatara, the pineal gland's effects on lizard <b>reproductive</b> <b>behavior,</b> and parietal skull openings in fossil [...] "mammal-like reptiles" [...] such as Lystrosaurus. His work had implications beyond reptile biology: Nobel laureate Julius Axelrod, after reading the work of Stebbins and others, began investigating the pineal gland in mammals, with emphasis on the effect of melatonin on activity cycles. Melatonin has since been found to influence human health. Stebbins was proud of his parietal and pineal work, calling it [...] "possibly the single piece of research which gives me the most satisfaction." ...|$|E
500|$|A hormone {{produced}} in the brain of the female moths controls sex pheromones. The hormone is released into the hemolymph to stimulate pheromone production. [...] Pheromone biosynthesis-activating neuropeptide (PBAN) is a peptide that regulates pheromone production in moths. It acts on the pheromone gland cells using calcium and cyclic AMP. Although the photoperiod regulates the release of PBAN to some extent, the chemical signals from the host plant supersede the effect {{from the time of}} day. Female Helicoverpa zea in corn fields do not produce pheromones during the night until they encounter corn. Several natural corn silk volatiles like the plant hormone ethylene induce H. zea pheromone production. The presence of the silk from an ear of corn is enough to cause pheromone production, and physical contact between females and corn is unnecessary. This evolutionary mechanism enables the moths to coordinate their <b>reproductive</b> <b>behavior</b> with the availability of food. Female moths often become depleted of sex pheromone after mating within 2 hours of separation from the male. The pheromonostatic peptide (PSP), a protein 57 amino acids long found in the male accessory gland, is what causes depletion of the femaleâ€™s sex pheromone. This capability in males has been selected for because it increases the reproductive fitness of those that carry it, since other males will not be attracted to a female without a sex pheromone; thus, the female will bear only the first male's offspring. The transfer of a spermatophore without accessory gland products does not stop female pheromone production, but does stop the female's calling behavior. Intense selection acting on males to manipulate female reproductive physiology promotes rapid evolution of specific molecules, and male-derived pheromone suppressing factors exhibit positive selection.|$|E
2500|$|Not much {{is known}} about the <b>reproductive</b> <b>behavior</b> of this rather elusive cat in the wild. Most of what is known has been learned from cats in captivity. Female Asian golden cats are sexually mature between 18 and 24 months, while males mature at 24 months. Females come into estrus every 39 days, at which time they leave {{markings}} and seek contact with the male by adopting receptive postures. During intercourse, the male will seize the skin of the neck of the female with his teeth. After a gestation period of 78 to 80 days, the female gives birth in a sheltered place to a litter of one to three kittens. The kittens weigh [...] at birth, but triple in size over the first eight weeks of life. They are born already possessing the adult coat pattern and open their eyes after six to twelve days. In captivity, they live for up to twenty years.|$|E

40|$|Optimal {{reproductive}} {{fitness is}} essential for the biological success and survival of species. The vomeronasal organ is strongly implicated in the display of sexual and <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviors</b> in female mice, yet the roles that apical and basal vomeronasal neuron populations play in controlling these gender-specific behaviors remain largely unclear. To dissect the neural pathways underlying these functions, we genetically inactivated the basal vomeronasal organ layer using conditional, cell-specific ablation of the G protein GÎ±o. Female mice mutant for GÎ±o show severe alterations in sexual and <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviors,</b> timing of puberty onset, and estrous cycle. These mutant mice are insensitive to reproductive facilitation stimulated by male pheromones that accelerate puberty and induce ovulation. GÎ±o-mutant females exhibit a striking reduction in sexual receptivity or lordosis behavior to males, but gender discrimination seems to be intact. These mice also show a loss in male scent preference, which requires a learned association for volatile olfactory signals with other nonvolatile ownership signals that are contained in the high molecular weight fraction of male urine. Thus, GÎ±o impacts on both instinctive and learned social responses to pheromones. These results highlight that sensory neurons of the GÎ±o-expressing vomeronasal subsystem, together with the receptors they express and the molecular cues they detect, control a wide range of fundamental mating and <b>reproductive</b> <b>behaviors</b> in female mice...|$|R
