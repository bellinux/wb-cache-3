5|$|HSP {{can develop}} after infections with streptococci (β-haemolytic, Lancefield group A), {{hepatitis}} B, herpes simplex virus, parvovirus B19, Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, Helicobacter pylori, measles, mumps, rubella, Mycoplasma and numerous others. Drugs linked to HSP, usually as an idiosyncratic reaction, include the antibiotics vancomycin and cefuroxime, ACE inhibitors enalapril and captopril, anti-inflammatory agent diclofenac, {{as well as}} <b>ranitidine</b> and streptokinase. Several diseases {{have been reported to}} be associated with HSP, often without a causative link. Only in about 35% of cases can HSP be traced to any of these causes.|$|E
25|$|Glaxo refined {{the model}} further by {{replacing}} the imidazole-ring of cimetidine with a furan-ring with a nitrogen-containing substituent, {{and in doing}} so developed <b>ranitidine.</b> <b>Ranitidine</b> was found to have a far-improved tolerability profile (i.e. fewer adverse drug reactions), longer-lasting action, and ten times the activity of cimetidine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ranitidine</b> (common {{brand name}} Zantac) was {{developed}} by Glaxo (also now GlaxoSmithKline), {{in an effort to}} match the success of Smith, Kline & French with cimetidine. <b>Ranitidine</b> was also the result of a rational drug design process utilising the by-then-fairly-refined model of the histamine H2 receptor and quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR).|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs that}} may have {{interactions}} with diazepam include antipsychotics (e.g. chlorpromazine), MAO inhibitors, and <b>ranitidine.</b>|$|E
25|$|In pregnancy, dietary {{modifications}} {{and lifestyle}} changes may be attempted, but often have little effect. Calcium-based antacids are recommended if {{these changes are}} not effective. Aluminum- and magnesium-based antacids are also safe, as is <b>ranitidine</b> and PPIs.|$|E
25|$|Gastrointestinal {{complaints}} {{are most often}} noted. The development of ulceration and/or bleeding requires immediate termination of treatment with diclofenac. Most patients receive a gastro-protective drug as prophylaxis during long-term treatment (misoprostol, <b>ranitidine</b> 150mg at bedtime or omeprazole 20mg at bedtime).|$|E
25|$|<b>Ranitidine</b> was {{introduced}} in 1981 and was the world's biggest-selling prescription drug by 1988. The H2-receptor antagonists have since largely been superseded by the even more effective proton pump inhibitors, with omeprazole becoming the biggest-selling drug for many years.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of longer-acting H2 receptor antagonists with fewer drug interactions and adverse effects, such as <b>ranitidine</b> and famotidine, decreased {{the use of}} cimetidine, and though it is still used, cimetidine is no longer among the more widely used of the H2-receptor antagonists.|$|E
25|$|On December 22, 2011, Covis Pharma, a {{specialty}} pharmaceutical company owned by affiliates of Cerberus, {{announced that it}} had agreed to acquire full commercial rights for Fortaz (ceftazidime), Zinacef (cefuroxime), Lanoxin (digoxin), Parnate (tranylcypromine sulfate), and Zantac Injection (<b>ranitidine</b> hydrochloride) in the United States and Puerto Rico from GlaxoSmithKline.|$|E
25|$|The more {{recently}} developed H2-receptor antagonists {{are less likely}} to alter CYP metabolism. <b>Ranitidine</b> is not as potent a CYP inhibitor as cimetidine, although it still shares several of the latter's interactions (such as with warfarin, theophylline, phenytoin, metoprolol, and midazolam). Famotidine has negligible effect on the CYP system, and appears to have no significant interactions.|$|E
25|$|Infants may see relief {{with changes}} in feeding techniques, such as smaller, more {{frequent}} feedings, changes in position during feedings, or more frequent burping during feedings. They may also be treated with medicines such as <b>ranitidine</b> or proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors however have not {{been found to be}} effective in this population and {{there is a lack of}} evidence for safety.|$|E
25|$|To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of peptic ulcers, indometacin should be prescribed at the lowest dosage needed to achieve a therapeutic effect, usually between 50–200mg/day. It should always be taken with food. Nearly all patients benefit from an ulcer protective drug (e.g. highly dosed antacids, <b>ranitidine</b> 150mg at bedtime, or omeprazole 20mg at bedtime). Other common gastrointestinal complaints, including dyspepsia, heartburn and mild diarrhea are less serious and rarely require discontinuation of indometacin.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol, {{often in}} high concentrations, {{is used to}} {{dissolve}} many water-insoluble medications and related compounds. Liquid preparations of cough and cold remedies, pain medication, and mouth washes may be dissolved in 1 to 25% concentrations of ethanol and {{may need to be}} avoided in individuals with adverse reactions to ethanol such as alcohol-induced respiratory reactions. Ethanol is present in over 700 liquid preparations of medicine including acetaminophen, iron supplements, <b>ranitidine,</b> furosemide, mannitol, phenobarbital, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and over-the-counter cough medicine.|$|E
25|$|Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole, are {{the most}} effective, {{followed}} by H2 receptor blockers, such as <b>ranitidine.</b> If a once daily PPI is only partially effective they may be used twice a day. They should be taken one half to one hour before a meal. There is {{no significant difference between}} agents in this class. When these medications are used long term, the lowest effective dose should be taken. They may also be taken only when symptoms occur in those with frequent problems. H2 receptor blockers lead to roughly a 40% improvement.|$|E
25|$|H2-receptor antagonists: include {{cimetidine}} (Tagamet), famotidine (Pepcid), nizatidine (Axid), and <b>ranitidine</b> (Zantac). Reduced secretion of {{gastric acid}} and pepsin produced by H2 blockers can reduce absorption of protein-bound (dietary) vitamin B12, {{but not of}} supplemental vitamin B12. Gastric acid is needed to release vitamin B12 from protein for absorption. Clinically significant vitamin B12 deficiency and megaloblastic anemia are unlikely, unless H2 blocker therapy is prolonged (2 years or more), or the person's diet is poor. It is also more likely {{if the person is}} rendered achlorhydric(with complete absence of gastric acid secretion), which occurs more frequently with proton pump inhibitors than H2 blockers. Vitamin B12 levels should be monitored in people taking high doses of H2 blockers for prolonged periods.|$|E

2500|$|Also, in 2008, Walgreens [...] "agreed to pay $35 {{million to}} the U.S. and 42 states and Puerto Rico for {{overcharging}} state Medicaid programs by filling prescriptions with more expensive dosage forms of <b>ranitidine,</b> a generic form of Zantac and fluoxetine, which is a generic form of Prozac." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{commercial}} name [...] "Tagamet" [...] was decided upon by fusing {{the two words}} [...] "antagonist" [...] and [...] "cimetidine". Subsequent to the introduction onto the U.S. drug market, two other H2 receptor antagonists were approved, <b>ranitidine</b> (Zantac, Glaxo Labs) and famotidine (Pepcid, Yamanouchi, Ltd.) [...] Cimetidine became the first drug ever to reach more than $1 {{billion a year in}} sales, thus making it the first blockbuster drug.|$|E
50|$|With gastric malignancies, {{relief of}} {{symptoms}} {{due to the}} use of <b>ranitidine</b> does not exclude the presence of a gastric malignancy. In addition, with kidney or liver impairment, <b>ranitidine</b> must be used with caution. Finally, <b>ranitidine</b> should be avoided in patients with porphyria, as it may precipitate an attack.|$|E
5000|$|Prevention of acid-aspiration {{pneumonitis}} during surgery: <b>ranitidine</b> can {{be administered}} preoperatively {{to reduce the}} risk of aspiration pneumonia. The drug not only increases gastric pH, but also reduces the total output of gastric juice. In a 2009 meta-analysis comparing the net benefit of proton pump inhibitors and <b>ranitidine</b> {{to reduce the risk}} of aspiration before anesthesia, <b>ranitidine</b> was found to be more effective than proton pump inhibitors in reducing the volume of gastric secretions. [...] <b>Ranitidine</b> may have an antiemetic effect when administered preoperatively.|$|E
50|$|Glaxo refined {{the model}} further by {{replacing}} the imidazole ring of cimetidine with a furan ring with a nitrogen-containing substituent, {{and in doing}} so developed <b>ranitidine.</b> <b>Ranitidine</b> was found to have a far-improved tolerability profile (i.e. fewer adverse drug reactions), longer-lasting action, and 10 times the activity of cimetidine. <b>Ranitidine</b> has 10% of the affinity that cimetidine has to CYP450, so it causes fewer side effects, but other H2 blockers famotidine and nizatidine have no CYP450 significant interactions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ranitidine</b> was {{introduced}} in 1981 and was the world's biggest-selling prescription drug by 1987.

50|$|A post-marketing study, {{conducted}} by the innovator, in over 12,000 patients showed that only 0.75% of them developed adverse events attributable to the drug. The adverse reactions were mild to moderate, which resolved when the drug was discontinued. Commonly observed adverse events included constipation (0.19%) and increase in levels of liver enzymes, AST (0.17%) and ALT (0.25%). In a post-marketing study conducted in 1500 Indian patients, only 9 adverse events were reported in 9 patients (0.63%) that were of mild to moderate intensity. Adverse events observed included constipation, acidity, nausea, fatigue and headache, and were of mild to moderate intensity.In all clinical studies, troxipide was well tolerated.
