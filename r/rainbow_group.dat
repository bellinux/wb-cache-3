40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} carried out at DSI-Glky Fish Production Station in Bolu and lasted for 350 days. Food {{consumption}} (FC) and feed conversion ratios (FCR) in Abant and rainbow trout in pond culture were compared. Abant trout larvae obtained from eggs of wild Abant trout broodstocks in Lake Abant and rainbow trout larvae obtained from eggs of the cultured broodstocks in Glky Fish Production Station were used in this study. Trial I involved 4 groups (2 Abant and <b>rainbow</b> trout experimental <b>groups</b> and 2 Abant and <b>rainbow</b> trout parallel <b>groups).</b> Two hundred and thirty-six larvae were in each group; a total of 944 Abant and rainbow trout larvae were used. Trial II involved 4 groups (2 Abant and <b>rainbow</b> trout experimental <b>groups</b> and 2 Abant and <b>rainbow</b> trout parallel <b>groups).</b> Two hundred and ten larvae were in each group; a total of 840 Abant and rainbow trout larvae were used. In both trials, a total of 1784 larvae were used. After the first feeding, {{at the end of}} day 350, although the mean wet weight of Abant trout was found to be around 5 g, the maximum increase in weight was found in rainbow trout. The final mean wet weight of rainbow trout was between 116. 33 and 173. 42 g in trials I and II. Abant and rainbow trout were fed ad libitum until they weighed 5 g. FC and FCR in Abant trout were not calculated because {{at the end of the}} study, the mean live weight of Abant trout was not over 5 g. FCR values increased with water temperature and the best FCR value (1. 12) was calculated in the <b>rainbow</b> trout parallel <b>group,</b> in trial II in August. There was a significant difference in FC...|$|R
