25|$|Like many accordionists of this era, Serry {{took note}} of the {{limitations}} imposed by the Stradella bass system during performances of classical music. In an effort to circumvent these limitations, he designed and developed a working model of a free-bass system for the accordion during this decade. It incorporated dual keyboards for the soloist's left hand while incorporating two sets of reeds which were tuned in octaves. This gave the soloist access to a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> which exceeded three and one-half octaves.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1978 with The Pickwick Papers, Keeping took on {{the mammoth}} task of {{illustrating}} the complete works of Charles Dickens for the Folio Society. His knowledge of the vanishing world of industrial London made him the perfect man for the job. The books were originally to be produced by letterpress printing, meaning the illustrations must be pure line drawings with no tones or washes. When they came to be published more modern printing techniques were used which would have allowed Keeping a full <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>tones,</b> but he had started with line drawings, so he used the same technique for the entire series, illustrating two books a year until he completed the task with Martin Chuzzlewit in 1988.|$|E

500|$|The story {{came from}} Midorikawa's desire to draw several scenes. [...] She was {{interested}} in drawing a scene where a boy dodges a girl who is falling towards him. [...] She also wanted to draw a shadowy summertime forest, which would allow her to expand the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> and blacks used in the manga. [...] A third inspiration was the desire to depict a more tranquil summer festival than those she had drawn before. [...] She was also eager to create the mask worn by Gin at the festival, which resembled {{the face of a}} fox whose typical slitted eyes were replaced by oval ones to give the mask a [...] "creepy" [...] hybrid fox-primate appearance.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{crossings}} in {{the country}} now are composed of lights, alarms and full, half or no barriers.

Many crossings are automatic, but can be manually operated or by CCTV or obstacle detection. There are some gated crossings still left {{in the country}}, as well as some open crossings with no lights, barriers or alarms. There are various classifications for crossings in the UK.|$|E
2500|$|Later {{players such}} as Robbie Breathnach, Tommy Hayes, Aidan [...] "Scobie" [...] McDonnell, Abe Doron, and Damien Quinn {{developed}} sophisticated pitch-varying techniques which allow players to follow the tune being played. This was {{the birth of the}} [...] "top-end" [...] style. Their breakthrough in this style has achieved local and international acclaim with many beginners now being educated in this manner. This [...] "top-end" [...] style, is often played on a smaller (14–15inch) and deeper (4–6inch) drum with a thinner resonant skin, prepared like the skin of a Lambeg drum. The tipper in this style is usually straight and most of the expressive action is focused on the top end of the drum. [...] The concept involves allowing a greater vs. lesser amount of the skin to resonate, with the [...] "skin hand" [...] acting as a moving bearing edge. [...] Top-end players move the skin hand from the bottom and towards the top of the drum to generate increasingly high pitches. [...] By making a [...] "C" [...] shape with the skin hand, the player can help enhance and even amplify the sound. [...] The same concept can be employed while playing {{at the front of the}} drum (the skin hand moving towards and away from the player) or in a [...] "bottom end" [...] style, which is essentially top end, but upside down, with the majority of tipper strikes at the bottom of the head. [...] In any of these styles, crossbars are most often absent, allowing a more unrestricted access for the left hand to modify the tone. This enables a more melodic approach to this rhythm instrument, with a wide <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> being employed.|$|E

50|$|Until his {{untimely}} death, {{some critics}} surmise that Tausig {{may not have}} had a pianistic equal, combining Liszt's force and <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>tone</b> color with the intellectuality of his fellow pupil Hans von Bülow. Another Liszt pupil, Eugen d'Albert, compared Tausig very favorably with their teacher. He said that while Liszt's musical conceptions were grander, Tausig possessed a better and more accurate technique coupled with a good deal of poetry.|$|R
2500|$|In the 17th century, Racine {{expressed}} {{admiration for}} Sophocles but was more influenced by Euripides (e.g. Iphigenia at Aulis and Hippolytus were the models for his plays Iphigénie and Phèdre). Euripides' reputation {{was to take}} a beating early in the 19th century when Friedrich Schlegel and his brother August Wilhelm Schlegel championed Aristotle's 'biological' model of theatre history, identifying Euripides with the moral, political and artistic degeneration of Athens. August Wilhelm's Vienna lectures on dramatic art and literature went through four editions between 1809 and 1846 and, in them, he opined that Euripides [...] "not only destroyed the external order of tragedy but missed its entire meaning," [...] a view that came to influence Friedrich Nietzsche, who however {{seems not to have}} known the Euripidean plays at all well. However literary figures such as the poet Robert Browning and his wife Elizabeth Barrett Browning could study and admire the Schlegels while still appreciating Euripides as [...] "our Euripides the human" [...] (Wine of Cyprus stanza 12). [...] Classicists such as Arthur Verrall and Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff reacted against the views of the Schlegels and Nietzsche, constructing arguments sympathetic to Euripides, which involved Wilamowitz in this restatement of Greek tragedy as a genre: [...] "A [...] tragedy does not have to end 'tragically' or be 'tragic'. The only requirement is a serious treatment." [...] In the English-speaking world, the pacifist Gilbert Murray {{played an important role in}} popularizing Euripides, influenced perhaps by his anti-war plays. Today, as in the time of Euripides, traditional assumptions are constantly under challenge and audiences therefore have a natural affinity with the Euripidean outlook which seems nearer to ours for example than the Elizabethan. As stated above, however, opinions continue to diverge, so that one recent critic might dismiss the debates in Euripides' plays as [...] "self-indulgent digression for the sake of rhetorical display" [...] and another springs to the poet's defence in terms such as: [...] "His plays are remarkable for their <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>tones</b> and the gleeful inventiveness, which morose critics call cynical artificiality, of their construction." ...|$|E
