500|$|The Hippocratic {{school of}} {{medicine}} described well the ailments of the human rectum and the treatment thereof, despite the school's poor theory of medicine. Hemorrhoids, for instance, though believed {{to be caused by}} an excess of bile and phlegm, were treated by Hippocratic physicians in relatively advanced ways. Cautery and excision are described in the Hippocratic Corpus, in addition to the preferred methods: ligating the hemorrhoids and drying them with a hot iron. Other treatments such as applying various salves are suggested as well. Today, [...] "treatment [...] still includes burning, strangling, and excising." [...] Also, some of the fundamental concepts of proctoscopy outlined in the Corpus are still in use. For example, the uses of the <b>rectal</b> <b>speculum,</b> a common medical device, are discussed in the Hippocratic Corpus. This constitutes the earliest recorded reference to endoscopy. Hippocrates often used lifestyle modifications such as diet and exercise to treat diseases such as diabetes, what is today called lifestyle medicine. He is often quoted with [...] "Let food be your medicine, and medicine be your food" [...] and [...] "Walking is man's best medicine", however the quote [...] "Let food be your medicine" [...] appears to be an apparent misquotation and its exact origin remains unknown.|$|E
50|$|A proctoscope is a hollow, tube-like {{speculum}} that is {{used for}} visual inspection of the rectum. Both disposable and non-disposable proctoscopes are available for use. Out of these, the non-disposable Kelly's <b>rectal</b> <b>speculum,</b> named after the American gynecologist Howard Atwood Kelly, is {{the most commonly used}} speculum for proctoscopy. Some proctoscopes have a light source for better visibility. The proctoscope is inserted into the anal canal with the patient in Sims' position. Fibre optic proctoscopes are now available which cause less discomfort to the patient.The proctoscope is used in the diagnosis of hemorrhoids, carcinoma of anal canal or rectum and rectal polyp. It is used therapeutically for polypectomy and rectal biopsy.|$|E

However, should the Therapist use reusable speculums, these speculums should, at a minimum, be autoclaved for sanitation and cleanliness (30 minutes). Additionally, the autoclave unit must be tested and inspected by competent authority at least four times per year- maintain documentation. (Under NO conditions should a disposable <b>speculum</b> or <b>rectal</b> tube be reused). I-ACT recognizes the FDA classifies equipment used to instill water into the colon through a nozzle inserted into the rectum to evacuate the contents of the colon into three distinct classes; Class I (Enema Kits), Class II and Class III are (Colon Irrigation Systems).
