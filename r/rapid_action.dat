Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan of the NSG was killed during the rescue of Commando Sunil Yadav, who was hit in the leg by a bullet during the rescue operations at Taj. 32 hostages were killed at the Oberoi Trident.|$|E
5|$|In Mumbai and Aurangabad, police {{rounded up}} more than 400MNS workers. In Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, MNS workers went on a rampage {{following}} the arrest of Raj, smashing windows and windscreens of eleven state buses. Thirteen rioters were arrested. They also chopped off both hands of a Bihari hawker sleeping on the streets. He was severely beaten until he fell unconscious. When he gained consciousness the following day, {{he found himself in}} a hospital with both hands amputated. The injured, mainly hawkers, were treated at the Nashik Civil Hospital after they were beaten. Shops along Nashik Road closed down after the incident. Incidents of stone pelting on state-run buses were reported from the Nashik Road, Ambad, Ravivar Peth, and Gangapur areas. Bus services were severely curtailed and diverted via Nipani. In Amrawati, MNS workers blocked roads and pelted stones at buses, damaging several vehicles in the process. Though contingents of the <b>Rapid</b> <b>Action</b> Force and the Central Industrial Security Force were deployed {{in many parts of the}} state, the police could not control violence by the MNS who adopted hit-and-run methods of attack. More than 200activists of the MNS were arrested across Nashik. Many activists went underground and coordinated with party activists from undisclosed locations.|$|E

5|$|The fire {{broke out}} in the factory at around 2:30 IST, as workers slept. Once they became aware of the blaze, the {{employees}} found they were unable to break through the factory's locked doors. Five fire tenders were sent to the scene, but by the time they arrived, local residents had broken down two locked gates and already rescued the surviving workers. These impromptu Rescue efforts were delayed however, when an individual carrying keys to open the door nervously dropped them while attempting to open the gate. At least 10 people were dead by the time rescuers reached the factory's interior, with a further eighteen injured. The survivors, many suffering from burns over 70 percent of their bodies, were taken to the National Medical College and Hospital, where victims had to be left on the floor due to a shortage of beds. The hospital did not have a burns unit, and the only treatments available at the hospital were ointments and saline drips. The patients were eventually moved to other hospitals. Local MLA Javed Khan later said that the death toll is actually at least twelve, but there has been no official confirmation of this.

40|$|Steroids exert {{their actions}} through several pathways. The {{classical}} genomic pathway, which involves binding of steroids to receptors and subsequent modulation of gene expression, is well characterized. Besides this, <b>rapid</b> <b>actions</b> of steroids {{have been shown}} to exist. Since 30 years, research on <b>rapid</b> <b>actions</b> of steroids is an emerging field of science. Today, rapid effects of steroids are well established, and are shown to exist for every type of steroid. The classical steroid receptors {{have been shown to}} be involved in <b>rapid</b> <b>actions,</b> but there is also strong evidence that unrelated structures mediate these rapid effects. Despite increasing knowledge about the mechanisms and structures which mediate these actions, there is still no unanimous acceptance of this category. This article briefly reviews the history of the field including current controversies and challenges. It is not meant as a broad review of literature, but should increase the awareness of the endocrinology society for rapid responses to steroids. As members of the organizing committee of the VI International Meeting on Rapid Responses to Steroid Hormones 2009, we propose a research agenda focusing on the identification of new receptoral structures and the identification of mechanisms of actions at physiological steroid concentrations. Additionally, efforts for the propagation of translational studies, which should finally lead to clinical benefit in the area of <b>rapid</b> steroid <b>action</b> research, should be intensified...|$|R

40|$|Estradiol plays {{a pivotal}} role in the control of GnRH {{neuronal}} function and female reproduction. While positive and negative feedback actions of estradiol that enhance and suppress release of GnRH and LH are primarily mediated through estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) located in interneurons, a series of recent studies in our laboratory indicate that <b>rapid</b> excitatory <b>actions</b> of estradiol also directly modify GnRH neuronal activity. We observed this phenomenon in cultured primate GnRH neurons, but similar <b>rapid</b> direct <b>actions</b> of estradiol are also described in cultured GnRH neurons and GFP-labeled GnRH neurons of mice. Importantly, <b>rapid</b> direct <b>action</b> of estradiol in GnRH neurons is mediated through membrane or membrane associated receptors, such as GPR 30, STX-sensitive receptors, and ERβ.

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades, several studies have {{unveiled}} a series of original signaling mechanisms through which so-called "nuclear" receptors can mediate <b>rapid</b> <b>actions</b> of steroid hormones. These <b>rapid</b> signaling <b>actions</b> are independent of the synthesis of mRNA or protein, and are therefore known as "nontranscriptional" or "nongenomic" {{as opposed to the}} classical genomic mechanisms. Nongenomic signaling of estrogens plays a prominent role in nonreproductive tissues, and between these is the vascular wall. At this level, estrogen triggers rapid vasodilatation, exerts anti-inflammatory effects, stimulates endothelial growth and migration, and protects the vessels from atherosclerotic degeneration. Nongenomic signaling mechanisms have been involved in many of these actions and are increasingly considered to be of importance for vascular function in physiological and pathophysiological conditions. <b>Rapid</b> <b>actions</b> of steroid hormones have been implicated with vascular as well as with myocardial protection in animal experimental models. Moreover, the nongenomic signaling of estrogens is tightly interconnected with the nuclear pathways, and there are several indications that, through nongenomic modulation of signaling cascades, estrogens are also able to modulate the expression of several relevant genes in endothelial cells. In conclusion, while we are still in an early phase of the investigations of the nontranscriptional actions of steroid hormone receptors, it is clear that this newly recognized category of signaling mechanisms is responsible for critical steroid actions in nonreproductive tissues...|$|R

50|$|ACTH {{influences}} {{steroid hormone}} secretion by both rapid short-term mechanisms {{that take place}} within minutes and slower long-term <b>actions.</b> The <b>rapid</b> <b>actions</b> of ACTH include stimulation of cholesterol delivery to the mitochondria where the P450scc enzyme is located. P450scc catalyzes {{the first step of}} steroidogenesis that is cleavage of the side-chain of cholesterol. ACTH also stimulates lipoprotein uptake into cortical cells.

40|$|Estrogen is a ligand for the {{estrogen}} receptor (ER), {{which on}} binding 17 beta-estradiol, {{functions as a}} ligand-activated transcription factor and regulates the transcription of target genes. This is the slow genomic mode of <b>action.</b> However, <b>rapid</b> non-genomic <b>actions</b> of estrogen also exist at the cell membrane. Using a novel two-pulse paradigm in which the first pulse rapidly initiates non-genomic actions using a membrane-limited estrogen conjugate (E-BSA), while the second pulse promotes genomic transcription from a consensus estrogen response element (ERE), we have demonstrated that <b>rapid</b> <b>actions</b> of estrogen potentiate the slower transcriptional response from an ERE-reporter in neuroblastoma cells. Since <b>rapid</b> <b>actions</b> of estrogen activate kinases, we used selective inhibitors in the two-pulse paradigm to determine the intracellular signaling cascades important in such potentiation. Inhibition of protein kinase A (PKA), PKC, mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) or phosphatidylinositol 3 -OH kinase (PI- 3 K) in the first pulse decreases potentiation of transcription. Also, our data with both dominant negative and constitutive mutants of Galpha subunits show that Galpha(q) initiates the rapid signaling cascade at the membrane in SK-N-BE(2) C neuroblastoma cells. We discuss two models of multiple kinase activation at the membrane Pulses of estrogen induce lordosis behavior in female rats. Infusion of E-BSA into the ventromedial hypothalamus followed by 17 beta-estradiol in the second pulse could induce lordosis behavior, demonstrating the applicability of this paradigm in vivo.
