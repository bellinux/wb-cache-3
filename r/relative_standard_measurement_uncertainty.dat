30|$|In this paper, the {{improvement}} of the measurement setup for the detection efficiency calibration of Si-SPAD detectors was described. These improvements are based on the optimization of the Si-SPAD detector positioning, which is now performed in a completely automated way. Furthermore, the uncertainty contribution due to the filter transmission measurement is practically negligible by using an integrating sphere, which diminishes the back reflection into the measurement setup. The overall <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> for the estimation of the Si-SPAD detection efficiency is now 0.16 % instead of 0.3 % as in López et al. (2015). However, this value has to be validated by independent measurements and comparisons with other national metrology institutes. The detailed analysis presented in this paper shows the potential for achieving low measurement uncertainties in determining the Si-SPAD detection efficiency even in the low photon flux range.|$|E

It is unclear how these artefacts influence dimensional measurements evaluated from CT data. Understanding and quantifying the influence of these artefacts on dimensional measurements is required to evaluate the uncertainty of CT-based dimensional measurements. In this work the influence of scatter and beam hardening on dimensional measurements is investigated using the beam stop array scatter correction method and spectrum pre-filtration for the measurement of an object with internal and external cylindrical dimensional features. Scatter and beam hardening are found to influence dimensional measurements when evaluated using the ISO 50 surface determination method. On the other hand, a gradient-based surface determination method {{is found to be}} robust to the influence of artefacts and leads to more accurate dimensional measurements than those evaluated using the ISO 50 method.

This is a more demanding application because in alkyd resins aromatic anhydrides and alcohols have reacted to form a polyester, and are not present in their original forms.

The current level of permitted emissions is typically between 50 µmol/mol and 100 µmol/mol, but lower values are expected in the future.

Twelve healthy adults (mean age 29. 1 years) completed the study. The second to the fifth chewing cycle of 5 bites were used for analyses. The reproducibility per outcome variable was calculated with an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and a Bland-Altman analysis was applied to determine the <b>standard</b> error of <b>measurement</b> <b>relative</b> error of measurement and smallest detectable differences of all variables.

We have developed a rigorous uncertainty analysis for carbon monoxide measurements carried out at the Izaña station, which could be applied to other GAW stations. We determine the combined <b>standard</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> taking into consideration four contributing components: uncertainty of the WMO standard gases interpolated over the range of <b>measurement,</b> the <b>uncertainty</b> that takes into account the agreement between the standard gases and the response function used, the uncertainty due to the repeatability of the injections, and the propagated uncertainty related to the temporal consistency of the response function parameters (which also takes into account the covariance between the parameters). The mean value of the combined standard uncertainty decreased significantly after March 2009, from 2. 37 nmol mol − 1 to 1. 66 nmol mol − 1, due to improvements in the measurement system. A fifth type of uncertainty we call representation uncertainty is considered when some of the data necessary to compute the temporal mean are absent. Any computed mean has also a propagated uncertainty arising from the uncertainties of the data used to compute the mean. The law of propagation depends on the type of uncertainty component (random or systematic). In situ hourly means are compared with simultaneous and collocated NOAA flask samples.

Conclusion <b>Relative</b> <b>standard</b> uncertainty caused by standard solution and uncertainty caused by titration analysis of zinc sulfate were the main factors for the determination of calcium dihydrogen phosphate using back titration analysis of zinc sulfate...|$|R
40|$|The {{velocities}} of propagating {{elastic waves}} {{can be used}} to determine the amount of damage in form of induced microcracks in rock materials and other materials. An increasing number of microcracks yields lower propagation velocities. To assess the damage, e. g. around tunnels caused by the excavation, is of interest since the damage affects the material properties, such as mechanical and thermal properties and permeability. A new ultrasonic testing system ULT- 100 from GCTS (Geotechnical Consulting and Testing Systems), aimed for measurement of p- and s-wave velocities, was evaluated. Reference cylindrical specimens in aluminium with different sizes were manufactured and a series of tests were conducted in order to find suitable wave arrival picking methods and to determine equipment specific constants which are needed to be determined. The procedure to do this was according to an ASTM <b>standard.</b> Expanded <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> for the wave velocity measurements were calculated according to Guide to the Expression of <b>Uncertainty</b> in <b>Measurement</b> (GUM). Equipment such as sensor holders and fixtures were manufactured {{in order to be able}} to conduct repeatable measurement on specimens. One test rig was made to carry out tests on nearly unloaded specimens in one direction and another was made for tests on axially loaded cylinders in a standard load frame with measurements in the axial plus two lateral directions. A Round Robin test was carried out on the three different types of testing equipment, one at SP, one at Swedish Cement and Concrete Research Institute (CBI), and one at Finnish Geological Survey (GTK) in Finland to evaluate the measurement results on p-wave velocity measurements. The results of the measurements were mainly in line with the calculated <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties.</b> The report is directed to persons working with wave velocity measurements using ultrasonics with particular interest of quality assurance of the measurements, which includes calibration, validation and uncertainty estimation...|$|R

This study examined the reliability of SEMG amplitude during maximal voluntary isometric contractions (MVICs) of the vastus lateralis following water immersion. Methods: Using a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer and in a randomized order, 12 healthy male subjects performed four MVICs at 60 ° knee flexion on both the dominant and nondominant kicking legs, and the SEMG was recorded. Each subject 2 ̆ 7 s dominant and nondominant kicking leg was then randomly assigned to have SEMG electrodes removed or covered during 15 min of water immersion (20 °C- 25 °C). Following water immersion, subjects performed a further four MVICs. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the <b>relative</b> <b>standard</b> error of <b>measurement</b> (...|$|R

In the field of metrology, the term "primary" refers to a standard whose quantity value and <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> are established without relation to another <b>measurement</b> <b>standard</b> for {{a quantity of the}} same kind; or to a procedure used to realize the definition of a measurement unit and obtain the quantity value and <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of a primary <b>measurement</b> <b>standard.</b> Accordingly, a phase and a normalized amplitude have to rely on ratio measurements.
