40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{remotely}} keyed encryption is to efficiently realize a secret-key block cipher by sharing the computational burden between a fast untrusted device and a slow device trusted with the key. This paper deals {{with how to}} define the security of remotely keyed encryption schemes. Since the attacker can take over the slow device and actually {{take part in the}} encryption process, common definitions of the security of block ciphers have to be reconsidered. Using random mappings, collision resistant hash functions, and stream ciphers as building blocks, the Random Mapping based Remotely Keyed (<b>RaMaRK)</b> encryption scheme is proposed. Also GRIFFIN is proposed, a fast new block cipher for flexible but large blocks. The <b>RaMaRK</b> scheme and GRIFFIN are provably secure if the underlying building blocks are secure. 1 Introduction At the Fast Software Encryption conference 1996 in Cambridge, Blaze [5] proposed a new paradigm for secret-key block ciphers: Remotely keyed encryption.

50|$|<b>Ramarks</b> are {{wide-band}} beacons which transmit continuously on {{the radar}} bands without having to be triggered by an incoming radar signal. The transmission forms a line of Morse characters on the display radiating from {{the centre of the}} display to its edge. They are not used in the United States.|$|R
40|$|Though {{there are}} not many {{references}} about the political facts that occurred in Hispania along the I century B. C., it must be <b>ramarked</b> the little and careless attention paid to the First Catilinarian Conspiracy of 66 and 64 by the Spanish scholars. Because of the importance that those events have particularly in the Hispanian history and consequently, in the Roman Republican history, the aim {{of this paper is to}} revise this question...|$|R
