40|$|Proteolytic milk-clotting enzymes are {{extracted}} {{from various sources}} (animals, plants, fungi) and processed according to various methods that are specific to each manufacturer or cheese-maker. Chemical composition and polypeptide patterns of 24 milk-clotting preparations from animal and fungal sources: 10 commercial <b>rennets,</b> 9 artisanal calf <b>rennets,</b> 2 recombinant chymosin preparations and 3 microbial preparations, were compared {{in order to identify}} differences according to both their manufacturing process and their source. The preparation from Cryphonectria parasitica had the highest ammonia and small peptide content. Commercial <b>rennets</b> and preparations from Rhizomucor miehei had the highest NaCl and pH values while artisanal <b>rennets</b> had the lowest and recombinant chymosins were intermediate. In comparison with the other commercial preparations, commercial <b>rennets</b> had the highest variability in chemical composition and their polypeptide profiles showed numerous protein bands ranging from 15 kDa to 197 kDa, like artisanal <b>rennets.</b> Protein composition of commercial <b>rennets</b> revealed the presence of bovine serum albumin, either native or degraded, and degraded chymosin. The results indicated that the source of coagulating enzymes and the conditions applied for enzyme extraction led to specific chemical compositions, polypeptide patterns and protein composition which are described in this article.

40|$|The {{first step}} in cheese {{manufacture}} is {{the formation of a}} gel from milk. This step can be achieved by adding milk-clotting preparations prepared from various sources and different methods. Each preparation contains not only coagulating enzyme(s) but also an associated support. Our objective was to characterize this support and to identify differences between preparations according to their manufacturing process and sources. Twenty-four preparations representative of the diversity available for cheese manufacture were sampled 3 times over a period of 6 months: 10 commercial <b>rennets,</b> 9 artisanally-produced calf <b>rennets,</b> 2 recombinant chymosins and 3 microbial preparations. Preparations were analysed for sodium, chloride, phosphorus, ammonia, free amino groups and ash contents, pH value and the phosphotungstic-acid-soluble nitrogen fraction. The protein diversity was determined by SDS−polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and particular bands identified by reversed-phase nano liquid chromatography coupled on line to tandem mass spectrometry. The preparations were clearly discriminated according to the composition of their support. Preparations from Cryphonectria parasitica had the highest content in ammonia and nitrogen fractions. Commercial <b>rennets</b> and preparations from Rhizomucor miehei had the highest values for mineral composition while traditional <b>rennets</b> had the lowest. Commercial <b>rennets</b> presented the highest variability in composition. This variability was also confirmed by electrophoresis performed at the same milk-clotting activity, in which numerous protein bands ranging from 10 kDa to 150 kDa were shown in contrast to other preparations. Among the identified proteins, bovine serum albumin was mainly present in commercial <b>rennets</b> as well as minor bovine proteins and as expected not in recombinant chymosins. The observed variability in the support between the investigated preparations was linked to the source of coagulating enzymes and within the same source was inherent to the method used to obtain preparations. Work is under progress to determine if support impacts the cheesemanufacturing process...|$|R
5|$|Some {{processes}} {{convert a}} meat or dairy product into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, <b>rennet</b> is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian <b>rennet.</b> The same applies to kosher gelatin, an animal product, derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.|$|E

5|$|The {{system worked}} as follows. First, the father's semen curdles the mother's menses, which Aristotle compares with how <b>rennet</b> (an enzyme from a cow's stomach) curdles milk in cheesemaking.

40|$|Cold {{storage is}} a {{well-known}} strategy to limit concerns about seasonality for sheep dairy productions. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of long-term freezing on milk <b>renneting</b> properties from the Sarda sheep, an autochthonous breed from Italy. Two-hundred milk samples from 50 pluriparous Sarda ewes were collected at monthly intervals throughout the lactation from April to July. Each sample of fresh milk was analysed for composition and subsamples were obtained and frozen for one, three and five months. <b>Renneting</b> properties, both from the fresh and frozen subsamples, were achieved using the Formagraph instrument and results were submitted to a mixed model statistical analysis. The storage effect significantly affected (P< 0. 01) the <b>renneting</b> parameters. A large amount of non coagulating subsamples was registered after a long-term frozen storage. Furthermore, milk clotting time was longer in frozen subsamples and curd firmness diminished after a freezing period of five months. In conclusion, the remarkable decreasing of sheep milk <b>renneting</b> characteristics after frozen storage can predict a worse yield and quality of cheese-making and suggests that freezing of Sarda raw milk should be limited to shorter periods...|$|R

5|$|Poe {{may have}} become engaged to Sarah Elmira Royster before he {{registered}} at the one-year-old University of Virginia in February 1826 to study ancient and modern languages. The university, in its infancy, was established on the ideals of its founder Thomas Jefferson. It had strict rules against gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and alcohol, but these rules were generally ignored. Jefferson had enacted a system of student self-government, allowing students {{to choose their own}} studies, make their own arrangements for boarding, and report all wrongdoing to the faculty. The unique system was still in chaos, and there was a high dropout rate. During his time there, Poe lost touch with Royster and also became estranged from his foster father over gambling debts. Poe claimed that Allan had not given him sufficient money to register for classes, purchase texts, and procure and furnish a dormitory. Allan did send additional money and clothes, but Poe's debts increased. Poe gave up on the university after a year, but did not feel welcome returning to Richmond, especially when he learned that his sweetheart Royster had married Alexander Shelton. He traveled to Boston in April 1827, sustaining himself with odd jobs as a clerk and newspaper writer. At some point, he started using the pseudonym Henri Le <b>Rennet.</b>|$|E

40|$|Laws of {{different}} countries regarding SCC of goat milk {{are not in}} agreement {{with each other and}} sometimes they fix a threshold for the enhancement of dairy products. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess if <b>renneting</b> properties of goat milk are influenced by higher somatic cell count (SCC) measured by an electronic cell counter. Milk samples, taken throughout the lactation of 169 goats from three farms, were analyzed for chemical, physical, hygienic and <b>renneting</b> properties. Samples were divided into three levels on the basis of their SCC: L: low level, samples with SCC lower than 10 6 cells/ml; M: medium, between 10 6 and 2 × 10 6 cells/ml; H: high, higher than 2 × 10 6 cells/ml. Milk clotting time was between 12. 07 and 13. 31 min, curd firming time between 1. 68 and 2. 05 min and curd firmness between 41. 66 and 48. 97 mm. All the three <b>renneting</b> properties were not affected by the SCC level but they were highly correlated with other factors as protein content and pH. Furthermore, the microbial count showed a high positive correlation with SCC. These results showed that in goat milk, contrarily to other dairy species, higher SCC did not affect <b>renneting</b> properties and that counting of somatic cells by using electronic cell counters might be not suitable for the improvement of dairy products...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} kappa-beta-casein genotypes and b-lactoglobulin genotypes on the <b>renneting</b> {{properties}} {{and composition of}} milk were estimated for 174 and 155 milk samples of 59 Finnish Ayrshire and 55 Finnish Friesian cows, respectively. As well as the random additive genetic and permanent environmental effects of a cow, the model included the fixed effects for parity, lactation stage, season, kappa-beta-casein genotypes and b-lactoglobulin genotypes. Favourable <b>renneting</b> properties were associated with kappa-beta-casein genotypes ABA 1 A 2, ABA 1 A 1 and AAA 1 A 2 in the Finnish Ayrshire, and with ABA 2 B, AAA 1 A 3, AAA 2 A 3, ABA 1 A 2 and ABA 2 A 2 in the Finnish Friesian. The favourable effect of these genotypes on curd firming time and on firmness of the curd was partly due to their association with a high kappa-casein concentration in the milk. The effect of the kappa-casein E allele on <b>renneting</b> properties was unfavourable {{compared with that of}} the kappa-casein B allele, and possibly with that of the A allele. The beta-lactoglobulin genotypes had no effect on <b>renneting</b> properties but they had a clear effect on the protein composition of milk.

25|$|<b>Rennet</b> is {{a mixture}} of enzymes used to {{coagulate}} milk into cheese. Originally it was available only from the fourth stomach of calves, and was scarce and expensive, or was available from microbial sources, which often produced unpleasant tastes. Genetic engineering made it possible to extract rennet-producing genes from animal stomachs and insert them into bacteria, fungi or yeasts to make them produce chymosin, the key enzyme. The modified microorganism is killed after fermentation. Chymosin is isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the Fermentation-Produced Chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers has an amino acid sequence that is identical to bovine <b>rennet.</b> The majority of the applied chymosin is retained in the whey. Trace quantities of chymosin may remain in cheese.|$|E
25|$|Camel milk {{cannot be}} made into butter by the {{traditional}} churning method. It can be made if it is soured first, churned, and a clarifying agent is then added.

500|$|At the Beecher's facility, their {{process for}} cheese {{manufacturing}} is multi-staged. Thousands {{of gallons of}} milk are hose-fed from delivery trucks into the manufacturing area, where it is heated to complete the pasteurization of the milk. The heated milk is processed into a stainless steel trough, and the temperature further increased, while the first live cheese cultures and <b>rennet,</b> a coagulant, {{are added to the}} developing mixture. According to Amir Rosenblatt, a cheesemaker at Beecher's, the heating and cheese temperatures used in their cooking process are tightly controlled through the sustainable technology of steam power. [...] "A variation of half a degree [...] can change the flavor of the cheese," [...] he said. Cheesemakers use stainless steel [...] "rakes" [...] to then gather the milk mixture, before allowing it to settle briefly, at which point the cheese is cut repeatedly by hand until it achieves a yogurt-like texture and substance. This process is repeated often, until a desired consistency is reached. The mixture is then drawn away to a new trough where most of the remaining water and whey is drained from the cheese. While the whey is continually pulled from the cheese, cheesemakers constantly separate the cheese by hand into smaller and small stacks of cheese curds, which form as the whey is removed. To complete the curding, a large amount of salt is added to cure the cheese and draw still more whey from it. The curds are finally cut into portions, filled into cheese molds, stacked on top of each other, and the remaining excess moisture is forced from the cheese with a constant [...] of pressure for at least 24 hours, before the finished cheese is stored to age. For every 10 pounds (10 kilograms) of milk and whey, Beecher's will typically create 1 pound (1 kilogram) of finished cheese.|$|E
