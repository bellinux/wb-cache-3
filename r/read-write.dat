25|$|A typical HDD has two {{electric}} motors; {{a spindle}} motor that spins the disks and an actuator (motor) that positions the read/write head assembly across the spinning disks. The disk motor has an external rotor attached to the disks; the stator windings are fixed in place. Opposite the actuator {{at the end of}} the head support arm is the <b>read-write</b> head; thin printed-circuit cables connect the <b>read-write</b> heads to amplifier electronics mounted at the pivot of the actuator. The head support arm is very light, but also stiff; in modern drives, acceleration at the head reaches 550 g.|$|E
25|$|AGC {{software}} {{was written in}} AGC assembly language and stored on rope memory. The bulk of the {{software was}} on read-only rope memory and thus couldn't be changed in operation, but some key parts of the software were stored in standard <b>read-write</b> magnetic-core memory and could be overwritten by the astronauts using the DSKY interface, as was done on Apollo 14.|$|E
25|$|As in Perl 5, {{the formal}} {{parameters}} (i.e., the {{variables in the}} parameter list) are aliases to the actual parameters (the values passed in), but by default, the aliases are constant so they cannot be modified. They may be declared explicitly as <b>read-write</b> aliases for the original value or as copies using the is rw or is copy directives should the programmer require them to be modified locally.|$|E
25|$|IBM's own IBM 5100 {{microcomputer}} (1975) offered APL {{as one of}} two built-in ROM-based interpreted languages for the computer, {{complete with}} a keyboard and display that supported all the special symbols used in the language. While the 5100 was very slow and operated its screen only like a typewriter, its follower the 5110 had more acceptable performances and a <b>read-write</b> addressable text screen. Graphics could be printed on an external matrix printer.|$|E
25|$|In particular, it is {{commonly}} used to refer to the coil of wire that moves the <b>read–write</b> heads in a moving-head disk drive. In this application, a very lightweight coil of wires is mounted within a strong magnetic field produced by permanent rare-earth magnets. The voice coil is the motor part of the servo system that positions the heads: an electric control signal drives the voice coil and the resulting force quickly and accurately positions the heads.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} 15 years {{there has been}} a drive to {{increase}} inward investment in the city, more recently concentrating on digital industries. Currently the three largest private-sector employers are American firms. Economic successes have included call centres and a large investment by Seagate, which has operated a factory in the Springtown Industrial Estate since 1993. Seagate currently employs over 1,000 people, producing {{more than half of the}} company's total requirement for hard drive <b>read-write</b> heads.|$|E
25|$|The Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) is {{a digital}} {{computer}} produced for the Apollo {{program that was}} installed on board each Apollo Command Module (CM) and Lunar Module (LM). The AGC provided computation and electronic interfaces for guidance, navigation, {{and control of the}} spacecraft. The AGC had a 16-bit word length, with 15 data bits and one parity bit. Most of the software on the AGC was stored in a special read only memory known as core rope memory, fashioned by weaving wires through magnetic cores, though a small amount of <b>read-write</b> core memory was provided.|$|E
25|$|When {{the logic}} board {{of a hard}} disk fails, the drive can often be {{restored}} to functioning order and the data recovered by replacing the circuit board with one of an identical hard disk. In the case of <b>read-write</b> head faults, they can be replaced using specialized tools in a dust-free environment. If the disk platters are undamaged, they can be transferred into an identical enclosure and the data can be copied or cloned onto a new drive. In the event of disk-platter failures, disassembly and imaging of the disk platters may be required. For logical damage to file systems, a variety of tools, including fsck on UNIX-like systems and CHKDSK on Windows, {{can be used for}} data recovery. Recovery from logical damage can require file carving.|$|E
2500|$|The SD Association defines {{standard}} speed classes for SDHC/SDXC cards indicating minimum performance (minimum serial data writing speed). Both {{read and write}} speeds must exceed the specified value. The specification defines these classes in terms of performance curves that translate into the following minimum <b>read-write</b> performance levels on an empty card and suitability for different applications: ...|$|E
2500|$|In DOS memory management, {{conventional}} memory, {{also called}} base memory, {{is the first}} 640 kilobytes (...) of the memory on IBM PC or compatible systems. It is the <b>read-write</b> memory directly addressable by the processor {{for use by the}} operating system and application programs. As memory prices rapidly declined, this design decision became a limitation in the use of large memory capacities until the introduction of operating systems and processors that made it irrelevant.|$|E
2500|$|Original {{flash memory}} designs had very limited {{estimated}} lifetimes. The failure mechanism for flash memory cells {{is analogous to}} a metal fatigue mode; the device fails by refusing to write new data to specific cells that {{have been subject to}} many <b>read-write</b> cycles over the device's lifetime. Premature failure of a [...] "live USB" [...] could be circumvented by using a flash drive with a write-lock switch as a WORM device, identical to a live CD. Originally, this potential failure mode limited the use of [...] "live USB" [...] system to special-purpose applications or temporary tasks, such as: ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{indication}} of Apple Inc.'s interest in ZFS was an April 2006 {{post on the}} opensolaris.org zfs-discuss mailing list where an Apple employee mentioned being interested in porting ZFS to their Mac OS X operating system. In the release version of Mac OS X 10.5, ZFS was available in read-only mode from the command line, which lacks the possibility to create zpools or write to them. Before the 10.5 release, Apple released the [...] "ZFS Beta Seed v1.1", which allowed <b>read-write</b> access {{and the creation of}} zpools,; however, the installer for the [...] "ZFS Beta Seed v1.1" [...] has been reported to only work on version 10.5.0, and has not been updated for version 10.5.1 and above. In August 2007, Apple opened a ZFS project on their Mac OS Forge web site. On that site, Apple provided the source code and binaries of their port of ZFS which includes <b>read-write</b> access, but there was no installer available until a third-party developer created one. In October 2009, Apple announced a shutdown of the ZFS project on Mac OS Forge. That is to say that their own hosting and involvement in ZFS was summarily discontinued. No explanation was given, just the following statement: [...] "The ZFS project has been discontinued. The mailing list and repository will also be removed shortly." [...] Apple would eventually release the legally required, CDDL-derived, portion of the source code of their final public beta of ZFS, code named [...] "10a286". Complete ZFS support was once advertised as a feature of Snow Leopard Server (Mac OS X Server 10.6). However, by the time the operating system was released, all references to this feature had been silently removed from its features page. Apple has not commented regarding the omission.|$|E
