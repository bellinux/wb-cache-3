Medusae have limited ability to regenerate, but polyps can do so from small pieces or even collections of separated cells.

5|$|Patients with {{abortive}} polio infections <b>recover</b> completely. In {{those who}} develop only aseptic meningitis, the symptoms {{can be expected}} to persist for two to ten days, followed by complete recovery. In cases of spinal polio, if the affected nerve cells are completely destroyed, paralysis will be permanent; cells that are not destroyed, but lose function temporarily, may <b>recover</b> within four to six weeks after onset. Half the patients with spinal polio <b>recover</b> fully; one-quarter <b>recover</b> with mild disability, and the remaining quarter are left with severe disability. The degree of both acute paralysis and residual paralysis is likely to be proportional to the degree of viremia, and inversely proportional to the degree of immunity. Spinal polio is rarely fatal.|$|E

Delayed β-galactosidase formation was found in relaxed auxotrophs <b>recovering</b> from amino acid starvation and in prototrophs <b>recovering</b> from chloramphenicol or from tetracycline treatment. The length of this delay was directly proportional to {{the duration of the}} treatment. All cells <b>recovering</b> from the various treatments exhibited a slightly decreased rate of β-galactosidase formation and an increase in radioactive amino acid incorporation...|$|R

5|$|A {{major problem}} was that of loss of feed {{material}} and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the feed material became finished product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} <b>recover</b> product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to <b>recover</b> the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E
5|$|Across Honduras, {{agriculture}} sustained serious damage, with initial {{estimates of}} 70% of crops destroyed. Flooding affected about 29% of the country's arable land, much of covered {{for an extended}} period of time. This washed away large areas of topsoil, which would take a long period of time to <b>recover.</b> About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar cane, and 58% of corn. About one-third of the corn crop had already been harvested. About 50,000bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to <b>recover.</b> Poor road conditions following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage.|$|E

If the ballistic fingerprint on the test-fired bullet or cartridge case matches the ballistic fingerprint on the <b>recovered</b> bullet or cartridge case, investigators know that the <b>recovered</b> bullet or cartridge case was also fired from the <b>recovered</b> gun. A confirmed link between a specific firearm and a bullet or cartridge case <b>recovered</b> from a crime scene constitutes a valuable lead, because investigators {{may be able to}} connect the firearm to a person, who may then become either a suspect or a source of information helpful to the investigation.|$|R

5|$|As {{one of the}} two {{principal}} common law courts along with the Common Pleas, the King's Bench's jurisdiction and caseload was significantly challenged by the rise of the Court of Chancery and equitable doctrines in the 15th and 16th centuries. To <b>recover,</b> the King's Bench undertook a scheme of revolutionary reform, creating less expensive, faster and more versatile types of pleading in the form of bills as opposed to the more traditional writs. Although not immediately stemming the tide, in the long term it helped the King's Bench not only <b>recover</b> but increase its workload. While there was a steep decline in business from 1460 to 1540, as the new reforms began to take effect the King's Bench's business was significantly boosted; between 1560 and 1640, it rose tenfold.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the player}} and the {{opponent}} have stamina meters, both {{displayed on the}} top of the screen. The meters decrease when either boxer gets hit by a punch. Boxers will get knocked down if their stamina meter runs out. Faster knockdowns will cause that boxer to <b>recover</b> less stamina upon getting up; the same happens if a boxer is knocked down by a knockout punch. Either boxer will lose if they cannot stand up before the count of ten after being knocked down (resulting in a knockout or KO) or if they are knocked down three times in the match (resulting in a technical knockout or TKO). The player can also <b>recover</b> some stamina while the opponent is down by pressing the buttons on the controller.|$|E
