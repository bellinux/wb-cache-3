40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new material}} data for single- and multilayer CMOS compatible poly-SiGe films, including mechanical quality factor (Q), Young’s modulus, and strain gradient. Using audio frequency folded-flexure comb-drive resonators, the mechanical quality factor of poly-SiGe was determined at 2 µTorr pressure. As-deposited poly-SiGe has Q = 20, 000 – 31, 000. CMOS compatible {{rapid thermal annealing}} (<b>RTA)</b> <b>at</b> 525 °C for 60 seconds results in a quality factor between 40, 000 and 44, 000. We have measured the highest Q factor yet reported for poly-SiGe (Q � 61, 100), {{as a result of}} <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> 600 °C for one minute. The measured resonant frequencies of the resonators were used to back-calculate the Young’s modulus of poly-SiGe: E = 155 ± 5 GPa. The calculated elastic modulus is significantly higher than the metallurgical Young’s modulus of 146 GPa. The as-deposited strain gradient of the tri-layer poly-SiGe film was found to be 1. 75 · 10 - 4 µm- 1 (curl-up). <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> 600 °C for one minute drops the tri-layer strain gradient to 2. 67 · 10 - 5 µm- 1 (curl-up). The graded Ge content multi-layer film was observed to induce a larger normalized strain gradient. I...|$|R
40|$|Results of a post-growth rapid thermal {{annealing}} (RTA) on GaAs proximity-capped structures with high density (- 10 (11) cm(- 2)) of self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are presented. Features due to the QDs, bi-dimensional platelets (2 DP) and InAs wetting layer (WL) were identified in photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the as-grown sample. It is shown, using transmission electron microscopy, that <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> temperature up to 700 degreesC (for 30 s) results in an increase of QDs lateral sizes. After <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> 800 degreesC or higher temperatures, no QDs can be distinguished and substantial thickening of the WL can be seen. The main PL peak blueshifts {{as a result of}} RTA in all investigated temperature ranges, which is accompanied by a quenching of the 2 DP and WL PL. It is proposed that the main PL peak, which is due to the QDs in the as-grown sample, results from optical recombination in the modified WL in the samples, after <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> 800 degreesC and higher temperatures. Laterally- enhanced Ga/In interdiffusion induced by strain is proposed to explain a relatively fast dissolution of QDs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} post-growth {{annealing}} effects of low- 	temperature grown Mg-doped InGaN. By using MOVPE, 	 1 mm-thick Mg-doped In x Ga 1 –x N (x ~ 0. 36) flms are grown at 	 570 8 C. In order {{to activate the}} Mg acceptors, grown samples 	are treated by the conventional furnace annealing (FA) or the 	rapid thermal annealing (RTA). In {{the case of the}} FA at 650 8 C 	for 20 min, the InGaN flm is phase-separated. On the other 	hand, the <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> a temperature higher than 700 8 C enables us 	to get p-type samples.

40|$|The outdiffusion of Be {{implanted}} into GaAs {{has been}} found to be identical after capless or capped (Si 3 N 4 or Si 02) rapid thermal annealing (<b>RTA)</b> <b>at</b> 900 - 1000 ºC and to depend on the Be dose and its proximity to the surface. The outdiffusion is more pronounced when the Be implant is shallow (1 X 1015 cm-²). It is demonstrated that the Be outdiffusion is driven by the presence of a highly damaged surface layer. Auger results suggest the formation of a BeOx compound at the surface of a high. dose (1 X 1016 cm-²) Be-implanted sample that underwent capless <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> 1000 ºC/ 1 s. It appears that BeOx formation occurs when the outdiffused Be interacts with the native Gal As oxides during annealing.

40|$|Cr-Fe-C alloy {{deposits}} {{were successfully}} prepared on high-carbon tool steel in a Cr 3 +-based electroplating bath containing Fe 2 + ions and suitable complex agents. A Cr-based alloy deposit was obtained with an electroplating current density higher than 25 Adm− 2, and a Fe-based alloy deposit was obtained using a current density of 20 Adm− 2. Following electroplating, these alloy deposited specimens were annealed via {{rapid thermal annealing}} (<b>RTA)</b> <b>at</b> 500 °C for different periods up to 30 s. The experimental results show that Cr- and Fe-based alloy deposits could be significantly hardened after <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> 500 °C for a few seconds. The maximum hardness {{was that of the}} Cr-Fe-C alloy deposit annealed at 500 °C for 10 s. The maximum hardness of 1205 Hv was detected from the annealed Cr-based alloy deposit prepared with 30 ASD. The hardening mechanism of annealed Cr- and Fe-based alloy deposits is attributed to the precipitation of C-related membranes. The hardness values of the annealed Cr- and Fe-based alloy deposits increase with the increasing degree of crystallization of the C-related membranes...|$|R
