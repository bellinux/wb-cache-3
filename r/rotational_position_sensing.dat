40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{modeling}} computer systems. The most well known computer model is the central server model. The level of detail of this model is insufficient to cope with problems like channel contention. Furthermore, the solution methods to this model are all based on product form assumptions and thus cannot deal with problems like priority queuing and non-exponential workloads. In this paper it is shown. however, that. by using some heuristic extensions of the mean value analysis. one can develop a central server based modeling tool for the performance evaluation of computer systems. which can cope with these problems. To reduce the computational complexity of the model. an aggregation method is introduced. For some aspects of computer performance. like channel contention in case of disk units operating with <b>rotational</b> <b>position</b> <b>sensing.</b> and disk seek operations. more detailed models are proposed...|$|E
50|$|Many new dishwashers feature microprocessor-controlled, sensor-assisted wash cycles that {{adjust the}} wash {{duration}} to {{the quantity of}} dirty dishes (sensed by changes in water temperature) or the amount of dirt in the rinse water (sensed chemically/optically). This can save water and energy if the user runs a partial load. In such dishwashers the electromechanical rotary switch often used to control the washing cycle {{is replaced by a}} microprocessor but most sensors and valves are still required to be present. However, pressure switches (some dishwashers use a pressure switch and flow meter) are not required in most microprocessor controlled dishwashers as they use the motor and sometimes a <b>rotational</b> <b>position</b> sensor to <b>sense</b> the resistance of water; when it senses there is no cavitation it knows it has the optimal amount of water. A bimetal switch or wax motor opens the detergent door during the wash cycle.|$|R

Proprioceptive impairment causes movement inaccuracies {{and lack of}} inter-limb coordination in several movement disorders, which necessitates an accurate joint <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> evaluation as part of neurological evaluation. Currently, <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> acuity (i. e., the sharpness of the sense) is evaluated by means of joint position matching methods which involve matching a target position on one limb with the same limb or the other. These <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> evaluations can only identify severe impairments of <b>position</b> <b>sense.</b> They fail to isolate proprioception from other sensory inputs and are confounded by factors such as inter-hemispheric transfer and working memory. Alternatively, psychophysical evaluation methods are available. They are often used in research to evaluate joint <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> and are considered as ‘gold standard’ for assessing the sensitivity and acuity of the perceptual system. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare and contrast the arm <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> acuity obtained by a contralateral matching task using a bimanual manipulandum with a psychophysical threshold measure using a passive motion apparatus. Results suggest that psychophysical testing provides a more precise measure of arm <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> acuity than measurements obtained in a contralateral matching task. Although, being two different evaluation methods for the common variable – arm <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> acuity, they show a poor correlation to each other.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present {{investigation}} was {{to examine the effects of}} a repeated eccentric exercise on <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> and muscle reaction angle. Fourteen healthy women underwent an isokinetic exercise session on their knee flexors, which was repeated after 4 weeks. Muscle damage indices, <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> and joint reaction angle of the knee were examined before, immediately after, as well as at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7 days after exercise. The second exercise bout induced significantly lesser effects in all muscle damage indices as well as lesser disturbances in <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> and reaction angle when compared to the first one. The main finding of this study is that <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> and joint reaction angle to release of the lower limbs may adapt in response to a repeated bout of eccentric exercise, leading to less disturbances in <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> and reaction angle after the second bout of exercise. © Springer-Verlag 2007...|$|R

The aim of the current study was to investigate cervical <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> before and after a 3 minute static posture (flexion or extension) in asymptomatic subjects. This dissertation is comprised of two main sections; a literature review followed by a manuscript for a research report that has been prepared in accordance with submission requirements for Manual Therapy.

The <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> deficit was more severe in right brain-damaged patients with neglect, where both the contralateral and the ipsilateral arm were involved.

40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] Knee joint {{proprioception}} combines {{sensory input}} {{from a variety}} of afferent receptors that encompasses the sensations of joint position and motion. Poor proprioception is one of the risk factors of anterior cruciate ligament injury. Most studies have favored testing knee joint <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> in the sagittal plane and non-weight-bearing position. One of the most common mechanisms of noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury is dynamic knee valgus. No study has measured joint <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> in a manner relevant to the mechanism of injury. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} measure knee joint <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> in the noncontact anterior cruciate liga-ment injury risk position and normal condition. [Subjects and Methods] Thirty healthy male athletes participated in the study. Joint <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> was evaluated by active reproduction of the anterior cruciate ligament injury risk position and normal condition. The dominant knees of subjects were tested. [Results] The results showed less accu-rate knee joint <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> in the noncontact anterior cruciate ligament injury risk position rather than the normal condition. [Conclusion] The poorer joint <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> in non-contact anterior cruciate ligament injury risk position compared with the normal condition may contribute to the increased incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injury...|$|R
40|$|Background: There {{have been}} reports of {{overhand}} throwing athletes having decreased joint <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> in their dominant shoulder {{as compared with the}} nondominant shoulder. Very little research, however, exists concerning joint <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> in the female athlete. Hypothesis: Female softball athletes have decreased joint <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> in their dominant shoulder as compared with their nondominant shoulder. Study Design: Factorial design with investigation of multiple independent variables. Methods: Joint <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> was assessed in 50 female softball players and 50 nonthrowing female athletes by using an inclinometer during four glenohumeral joint motions. Both the dominant and nondominant shoulders were assessed and error scores were calculated to describe joint <b>position</b> <b>sense.</b> Data were collected {{during the course of a}} fall semester and analyzed by using a mixed model analysis of variance with repeated measures on the dependent variable (error scores).

Conclusion: We failed to reject the null hypothesis. Increased error scores (less joint <b>position</b> <b>sense)</b> were observed in both arms of subjects in the softball group. Clinical Relevance: This study suggests that there is decreased shoulder proprioception in asymptomatic female athlete...|$|R

40|$|Background. Impairment of <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> of {{the upper}} {{extremity}} (UE) may impede {{activities of daily living}} and limit motor gains after stroke. Most clinical assessments of <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> rely on categorical or ordinal ratings by clinicians that lack sensitivity to change or the ability to discriminate subtle deficits. Objective. Use robotic technology to develop a reliable, quantitative technique with a continuous scale to assess UE <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> following stroke. Methods. Forty-five patients recruited from an inpatient stroke rehabilitation service and 65 age-matched healthy controls performed an arm position matching task. Each UE was fitted in the exoskeleton of a KINARM device. One UE was passively placed in one of 9 positions, and the subject was told to match his or her position with the other UE. Patients were compared with statistical distributions of control data to identify those with deficits in UE <b>position</b> <b>sense.</b> Test–retest sessions using 2 raters established interrater reliability. Results. Two thirds of left hemiparetic and one third of right hemiparetic patients had deficits in limb <b>position</b> <b>sense.</b> Left-affected stroke subjects demonstrated significantly more trial-to-trial variability than right-affected or control subjects. The robotic assessment technique demonstrated good interrater reliability but limited agreement with the clinical thumb localizing test. Conclusions.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effect of fatigue in shoulder external rotator muscles on <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> of shoulder abduction, internal rotation, and external rotation. The study included 10 healthy subjects. Shoulder <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> was measured before and after a fatigue task involving shoulder external rotator muscles. The fatigue task was performed using an isokinetic machine. To confirm the muscle fatigue, electromyography (EMG) was recorded, and an integrated EMG and median power frequency (MDF) during 3 sec performed target torque were calculated. After the fatigue task, the MDF of the infraspinatus muscle significantly decreased. This indicates that the infraspinatus muscle {{was involved in the}} fatigue task. In addition, the shoulder <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> of internal and external rotation significantly decreased after the fatigue task. These results suggest that the fatigue reduced the accuracy of sensory input from muscle spindles. However, no significant difference was observed in shoulder <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> of abduction before and after the fatigue task.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to examine whether <b>position</b> <b>sense</b> and joint reaction angle to release can be affected by eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage. Twelve women underwent an isokinetic exercise session of the lower limb. Isometric peak torque, delayed-onset muscle soreness, serum creatine kinase, <b>position</b> <b>sense,</b> and knee joint reaction angle to release were examined before, immediately after, and 24, 48, and 72 h post-exercise.
