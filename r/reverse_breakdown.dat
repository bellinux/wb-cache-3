40|$|Abstract. The bad {{shunting}} {{of track}} circuit {{results from the}} contact resistance between wheel and rail and its solution becomes a disturbing problem for electrical engineer technicians. Based on the Holm electrical contact model, Greenwood model and thermal breakdown theory, this paper analyzed the mechanism of contact resistance between wheel and rail. Then breakdown characteristic of the imperfect electrical layer is analyzed. Through field test, its character is similar to <b>reversed</b> <b>breakdown</b> of diode and the contact resistance decreases as the current ascending. The conclusions of the experiments not only prove the validity of Holm and Greenwood model, but also provide the professional and practical parameters for solving bad shunting. And these parameters involve the breakdown voltage and short-circuit current...|$|R

25|$|These {{can be made}} {{to conduct}} in reverse bias (backward), and are {{correctly}} termed <b>reverse</b> <b>breakdown</b> diodes. This effect, called Zener breakdown, occurs at a precisely defined voltage, allowing the diode {{to be used as a}} precision voltage reference. The term Zener diode is colloquially applied to several types of breakdown diodes, but strictly speaking Zener diodes have a breakdown voltage of below 5 volts, whilst avalanche diodes are used for breakdown voltages above that value. In practical voltage reference circuits, Zener and switching diodes are connected in series and opposite directions to balance the temperature coefficient response of the diodes to near-zero. Some devices labeled as high-voltage Zener diodes are actually avalanche diodes (see above). Two (equivalent) Zeners in series and in reverse order, in the same package, constitute a transient absorber (or Transorb, a registered trademark).|$|E
25|$|These are diodes that {{conduct in}} the reverse {{direction}} when the reverse bias voltage exceeds the breakdown voltage. These are electrically {{very similar to}} Zener diodes (and are often mistakenly called Zener diodes), but break down by a different mechanism: the avalanche effect. This occurs when the reverse electric field applied across the p–n junction causes a wave of ionization, reminiscent of an avalanche, leading to a large current. Avalanche diodes are designed to break down at a well-defined reverse voltage without being destroyed. The difference between the avalanche diode (which has a <b>reverse</b> <b>breakdown</b> above about 6.2V) and the Zener is that the channel length of the former exceeds the mean free path of the electrons, resulting in many collisions between them on {{the way through the}} channel. The only practical difference between the two types is they have temperature coefficients of opposite polarities.|$|E
25|$|Gifford {{said that}} Widlar and Talbert were {{actually}} {{the founders of}} National Semiconductor, and that Sporck joined them later. The duo started by setting up the epitaxial process at Santa Clara. Once the technology was in place, Widlar concentrated on voltage regulators {{and by the end}} of 1966 produced the industry's first integrated linear regulator. The LM100, a revolutionary new circuit, became another flagship product that surpassed expectations for sales and longevity. In 1967 Widlar designed the LM101, an operational amplifier with improved gain, decreased input current, and protection against short circuit. The LM101 featured another unorthodox input stage, employing NPN input transistors emitter coupled to PNP transistors in a common base arrangement. The high <b>reverse</b> <b>breakdown</b> voltage of the PNP transistors allowed the LM101 to withstand a differential input voltage of ±30 V. Its frequency compensation was simpler and more robust and stable than that of μA709. It was followed by LM101A, a functionally identical IC that pioneered the use of a field-effect transistor to control internal current sources. Widlar's solution minimized die area and current drain, and enabled operation over a wide range of power supply voltages. Later he devised another new device, the super-beta transistor. It was created in silicon by Talbert and integrated in the LM108 precision operational amplifier, which was released in 1969. These high-gain, very-low-voltage devices were capable of operating at very low input currents within the full military range of operating conditions. The items in the linear circuit product line were user friendly, very useful, and very profitable.|$|E

The epitaxial parameters, processing and design are being optimized for high yield manufacturing. Self-aligned processing and high resolution lithography enable vertical sidewalls, sub-micron linewidths and uniform metallizations. Optimized oxide passivation techniques allow for low leakage currents and sharp onsets of gate-to-source <b>reverse</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> Dielectric layers provide device isolation and reliability. Floating guard-ring widths, spacings and {{numbers have been}} optimized for high-voltage blocking at low resistance. The functional yields for high-frequency VJFETs were in the 78 - 88 % range, for an eight wafer lot. The high-power VJFET functional yields were in the 75 - 85 % range for a four wafer lot. The wafers exhibited excellent performance parameter uniformity. High-power VJFETs are capable of blocking 1. 6 kV with a relatively low associated specific-on resistance of 2. 1 mΩ cm 2 (V 2 br / Ron,sp = 1. 2 GW/cm 2). The VJFETs are scaled to increase current output and have been connected in the cascode configuration to form + 1200 V blocking, all-SiC, normally-off power switches...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} nuclear {{radiation}} {{on the reverse}} bias electrical characteristics of one hundred silicon power diodes were investigated. On a percentage basis, the changes in reverse currents were large but, due to very low initial values, this electrical characteristic was not the limiting factor in use of these diodes.

2500|$|The 0Z4 was a {{gas-filled}} rectifier tube {{commonly used in}} vacuum tube car radios in the 1940s and 1950s. It was a conventional full-wave rectifier tube with two anodes and one cathode, but was unique in {{that it had no}} filament (thus the [...] "0" [...] in its type number). The electrodes were shaped such that the <b>reverse</b> <b>breakdown</b> voltage was much higher than the forward breakdown voltage. Once the breakdown voltage was exceeded, the 0Z4 switched to a low-resistance state with a forward voltage drop of about 24 V.|$|E
2500|$|The Shockley {{ideal diode}} {{equation}} or the diode law is derived {{with the assumption}} that the only processes giving rise to the current in the diode are drift (due to electrical field), diffusion, and thermal recombination–generation (R–G) (this equation is derived by setting n = 1 above). It also assumes that the R–G current in the depletion region is insignificant. This means that the Shockley ideal diode equation doesn't account for the processes involved in <b>reverse</b> <b>breakdown</b> and photon-assisted R–G. Additionally, it doesn't describe the [...] "leveling off" [...] of the I–V curve at high forward bias due to internal resistance. Introducing the ideality factor, n, accounts for recombination and generation of carriers.|$|E
2500|$|At {{very large}} reverse bias, beyond the {{peak inverse voltage}} or PIV, a process called <b>reverse</b> <b>breakdown</b> occurs that causes a large {{increase}} in current (i.e., {{a large number of}} electrons and holes are created at, and move away from the p–n junction) that usually damages the device permanently. The avalanche diode is deliberately designed for use in that manner. In the Zener diode, the concept of PIV is not applicable. A Zener diode contains a heavily doped p–n junction allowing electrons to tunnel from the valence band of the p-type material to the conduction band of the n-type material, such that the reverse voltage is [...] "clamped" [...] to a known value (called the Zener voltage), and avalanche does not occur. Both devices, however, do have a limit to the maximum current and power they can withstand in the clamped reverse-voltage region. Also, following the end of forward conduction in any diode, there is reverse current for a short time. The device does not attain its full blocking capability until the reverse current ceases.|$|E

The voltage drop in forward bias decreases from about 60 volts at 0 °C to somewhat above 10 volts at 50 °C and then stays constant; the <b>reverse</b> bias <b>breakdown</b> ("arc-back") voltage drops dramatically with temperature, from 36 kV at 60 °C to 12 kV at 80 °C to even less at higher temperatures. The operating range is therefore usually between 18-65 °C.|$|R

25|$|Reverse-active (or inverse-active or inverted): By {{reversing}} the biasing {{conditions of the}} forward-active region, a bipolar transistor goes into reverse-active mode. In this mode, the emitter and collector regions switch roles. Because most BJTs are designed to maximize current gain in forward-active mode, the βF in inverted mode is several times smaller (2–3 times for the ordinary germanium transistor). This transistor mode is seldom used, usually being considered only for failsafe conditions and some types of bipolar logic. The <b>reverse</b> bias <b>breakdown</b> voltage to the base may be {{an order of magnitude}} lower in this region.|$|R
