2500|$|Casco {{was elected}} as a National Deputy for the <b>Radical</b> <b>Liberal</b> <b>Party</b> in 1968, {{along with two}} women from the Colorado Party and re-elected in 1973, when two new female Deputies, Leonidas Paez de Virgilli and Ligia Prieto Centurión, were also elected. Almost {{immediately}} she began working to improve the situation of prisoners. At the time, prisoners were held in cells which had no beds or mattresses, no toilets, and were provided with no food. She demanded that the conditions improve and that all political prisoners be released. Simultaneously, through the Commission, she met regularly with prisoners' families and provided them with material and moral support. Her outspokenness resulted in constant harassment, physical abuse from government operatives, repeated arrests, and vilification in the press. Two of her sons, {{as well as one}} of her brothers and a brother-in-law, were also arrested and tortured. Her mail was monitored, her telephone was tapped, and she was unable to obtain a passport.

She regularly participated in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights review process and {{on more than one occasion}} was personally the subject of concern for having her rights violated. Casco also began traveling internationally in the 1980s, attending conferences on human rights. In 1980, she traveled to London at the invitation of Liberal International to discuss human rights in her country. She was arrested in 1981 after returning from a trip to Germany and again in 1988 when returning from a trip to Spain. It was alleged that she had taken part in a march, La Convergência [...] Nacional [...] por [...] Los [...] Derechos [...] Humanos (The National Convergence for Human Rights), held to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but in reality, she was arrested in the airport returning from Europe.
