5|$|<b>Ramus</b> - son of {{the town}} mayor who dreams of one day opening his own shop, and begins Alex's adventuring career by having him fetch a priceless diamond from a dragon's cave.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the plot}} of Lunar: The Silver Star was written by novelist Kei Shigema, and {{involves}} a world of high fantasy and with emphasis on folklore and legend. The game begins in the small mountain town of Burg, where a young Alex frequently visits the monument to the fallen hero Dyne, his idol. At the behest of <b>Ramus,</b> eager son of the town mayor, <b>Ramus</b> and Alex embark on their first real adventure, with Alex's adopted sister Luna and their talking flying pet Nall, to the mysterious Dragon's Cave {{in search of a}} valuable diamond. Making their way through the cavern, the group meets Quark, an aged dragon who senses great potential in Alex, and urges him to complete the trials of other dragons to become the next Dragonmaster, champion of the Goddess Althena, and protector of the world. Quark shows an interest in Luna as well, remarking that she has a familiar aura about her. Obtaining the diamond from Quark, <b>Ramus</b> finds he cannot sell it in Burg, and must travel to the major trade city of Meribia to claim his fortune. The group then makes their way to Saith, a small port town to the south, where Luna leaves the group to stay with Alex's family.|$|E
5|$|Across the ocean, Alex, Nall, and <b>Ramus</b> enter Meribia, {{where they}} meet {{one of the}} legendary Four Heroes, Mel. Attempting to sell his diamond, <b>Ramus</b> is swindled by a jewel dealer who flees into the sewers. After {{reclaiming}} it, <b>Ramus</b> slyly bargains the owner's life for his entire shop, and leaves the group to pursue his dream of becoming rich. Alex and Nash depart {{for the city of}} Vane where they meet Mia, daughter of the city's ruler and Nash's love interest, who informs them of Ghaleon, head of the guild and former great hero who fought with Dyne years ago. Seemingly intrigued by Alex's quest, Ghaleon sends Alex on a mission to investigate the appearance of a false Dragonmaster in a faraway town. Upon arrival, Alex meets Jessica, daughter of Mel and aspiring priestess, who helps him locate the imposter before returning to Vane. Pleased with his success, Ghaleon accompanies Alex back to his hometown to meet Quark and discuss Alex's future, when he suddenly attacks, revealing himself as the Magic Emperor and seemingly kills Quark in a fit of rage. Citing the loss of his friend Dyne, who died protecting the Goddess, Ghaleon swears revenge on both she and her dragons and departs after kidnapping Luna. Distraught, Alex and Nall return to Meribia to find it under attack by a band of monsters under Ghaleon's command. Regrouping with Jessica, the group fights back a wave of invaders before witnessing Mel turn to stone from a dark spell of Xenobia, Ghaleon's top general. Wanting revenge, Jessica accompanies Alex to Vane, also under siege, and assists Nash and Mia with a similar invasion before they too join the group.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{is divided}} into two groups of somites. The {{anterior}} group is composed of four somites, each with well-developed walking limbs with lengths that extend past the margins of the carapace. Their morphological details are not well preserved but their distal segments appear to possess a multitude of small spines. It is unknown if these limbs are biramous, but they are assumed to be the endopodites, the inner branches (<b>ramus)</b> of the leg, with the exopodites, or outer branches, absent or not preserved.|$|E
5|$|The holotype of Paranthodon, BMNH 47338, {{was found}} in a layer of the Kirkwood Formation that has been dated between the Berriasian and early Valanginian ages. It {{consists}} {{of the back of the}} snout, containing the maxilla with teeth, the posterior caudodorsal <b>ramus</b> of the premaxilla, part of the nasals, and some isolated teeth probably from the lower jaw. One additional specimen can be assigned to it based on the dentition, BMNH 47992, including only isolated teeth sharing the same morphology as those from the holotype. However, the teeth do not bear any autapomorphies of Paranthodon, and were referred to an indeterminate stegosaurid in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the slain}} were the philosopher Petrus <b>Ramus,</b> and in Lyon the {{composer}} Claude Goudimel. The corpses floating down the Rhone from Lyons {{are said to}} have put the people of Arles off drinking the water for three months.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ramus</b> {{fractures}} {{are said}} to involve a region inferiorly bounded by an oblique line extending from the lower third molar (wisdom tooth) region to the posteroinferior attachment of the masseter muscle, and {{which could not be}} better classified as either condylar or coronoid fractures.|$|E
25|$|The two parotid glands {{are major}} salivary glands {{wrapped around the}} mandibular <b>ramus</b> in humans. The largest of the salivary glands, they secrete saliva to {{facilitate}} mastication and swallowing, and amylase to begin the digestion of starches. It is the serous type of gland which secretes the ptyalin. It enters the oral cavity via the parotid duct or Stensen duct. The glands are located posterior to the mandibular <b>ramus</b> and anterior to the mastoid process of the temporal bone. They are clinically relevant in dissections of facial nerve branches while exposing the different lobes of it since any iatrogenic lesion will result in either loss of action or strength of muscles involved in facial expression. They produce 20% of the total salivary content in the oral cavity. Mumps, a virus infection, is caused due to infection in parotid salivary gland.|$|E
25|$|The {{angle of}} the {{mandible}} refers to the angle created by {{the arrangement of the}} body of the mandible and the <b>ramus.</b> Angle fractures are defined as those that involve a triangular region bounded by the anterior border of masseter muscle and an oblique line extending from the lower third molar (wisdom tooth) region to the posteroinferior attachment of the masseter muscle.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the most}} useful classification, because both the signs and symptoms, and also the {{treatment}} are dependent upon {{the location of the}} fracture. The mandible is usually divided into the following zones for the purpose of describing the location of a fracture (see diagram): condylar, coronoid process, <b>ramus,</b> angle of mandible, body (molar and premolar areas), parasymphysis and symphysis.|$|E
25|$|While the 17th- {{and early}} 18th-century American {{philosophical}} tradition was decidedly marked by religious themes and the Reformation reason of <b>Ramus,</b> the 18th century saw more reliance {{on science and}} the new learning of the Age of Enlightenment, along with an idealist belief in the perfectibility of human beings through teaching ethics and moral philosophy, laissez-faire economics, and a new focus on political matters.|$|E
25|$|Continued fractions, {{closely related}} to irrational numbers (and due to Cataldi, 1613), {{received}} attention {{at the hands of}} Euler, and {{at the opening of the}} 19thcentury were brought into prominence through the writings of Joseph Louis Lagrange. Other noteworthy contributions have been made by Druckenmüller (1837), Kunze (1857), Lemke (1870), and Günther (1872). <b>Ramus</b> (1855) first connected the subject with determinants, resulting, with the subsequent contributions of Heine, Möbius, and Günther, in the theory of Kettenbruchdeterminanten.|$|E
25|$|The sphenomandibular {{ligament}} {{runs from}} {{the spine of the}} sphenoid bone to the lingula of mandible. The inferior alveolar nerve descends between the sphenomandibular ligament and the <b>ramus</b> of the mandible {{to gain access to the}} mandibular foramen. The sphenomandibular ligament, because of its attachment to the lingula, overlaps the opening of the foramen. It is a vestige of the embryonic lower jaw, Meckel cartilage. The ligament becomes accentuated and taut when the mandible is protruded.|$|E
25|$|The abelisaurids all possess distinct, vestigial, and {{immobile}} forelimbs, {{with highly}} reduced manual phalanges. Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus {{are closely related}} but distinguish by several skeletal features. Carnotaurus has eleven dorsal vertebrae but Majungasaurus has thirteen. Carnotaurus has short dentary bones and an almost vertical <b>ramus,</b> while that of Majungasaurus curved backward and had notable caudal projections. Majungasaurines also have low, wide antorbital fenestrae, a wide triangular plate posterior to the parietal, two holes for a cerebral vein by the sagittal crest, and a wide groove on the occipital condyle. These differences are important because derived abelisaurids are classed as either majungasaurines or carnotaurines based on their synapomorphies.|$|E
25|$|The lower limbs (human legs) {{have also}} been damaged. The left iliac crest {{contains}} small fractures. The inferior pubic <b>ramus</b> also contains similar fractures. Due {{to the lack of}} evidence of healing, it is likely that all these fractures were part of the postmortem damage to the Lady's body. The right tibia has a defective area {{at the front of the}} distal shaft. The defective area extends 33.5 millimetres above the ankle joint. The metatarsal bones of both feet are broken, and missing from the body. The phalanx bones of both feet are also missing. There is a subcutaneous (hypodermic) filling at the back of the Lady's right hip region, where her buttock is located.|$|E
25|$|Following the Scottish Reformation in 1560, King's College was purged of its Roman Catholic staff but {{in other}} respects was largely {{resistant}} to change. George Keith, the fifth Earl Marischal was a moderniser within the college and supportive of the reforming ideas of Peter <b>Ramus.</b> In April 1593 he founded a second university in the city, Marischal College. It is also possible the founding of another college in nearby Fraserburgh by Sir Alexander Fraser, a business rival of Keith, was instrumental in its creation. Aberdeen was highly unusual at this time for having two universities in one city: as 20th-century University prospectuses observed, Aberdeen had the same number as existed in England at the time (the University of Oxford and University of Cambridge).|$|E
25|$|The {{adductor}} {{muscles of}} the thigh are innervated by the obturator nerve, {{with the exception of}} pectineus which receives fibers from the femoral nerve, and the adductor magnus which receives fibers from the tibial nerve. The gracilis arises from near the pubic symphysis and is unique among the adductors in that it reaches past the knee to attach on the medial side of the shaft of the tibia, thus acting on two joints. It share its distal insertion with the sartorius and semitendinosus, all three muscles forming the pes anserinus. It is the most medial muscle of the adductors, and with the thigh abducted its origin can be clearly seen arching under the skin. With the knee extended, it adducts the thigh and flexes the hip. The pectineus has its origin on the iliopubic eminence laterally to the gracilis and, rectangular in shape, extends obliquely to attach immediately behind the lesser trochanter and down the pectineal line and the proximal part of the linea aspera on the femur. It is a flexor of the hip joint, and an adductor and a weak medial rotator of the thigh. The adductor brevis originates on the inferior <b>ramus</b> of the pubis below the gracilis and stretches obliquely below the pectineus down to the upper third of the linea aspera. Except for being an adductor, it is a lateral rotator and weak flexor of the hip joint. The adductor longus has its origin at superior <b>ramus</b> of the pubis and inserts medially on the middle third of the linea aspera. Primarily an adductor, it is also responsible for some flexion. The adductor magnus has its origin just behind the longus and lies deep to it. Its wide belly divides into two parts: One is inserted into the linea aspera and the tendon of the other reaches down to adductor tubercle on the medial side of the femur's distal end where it forms an intermuscular septum that separates the flexors from the extensors. Magnus is a powerful adductor, especially active when crossing legs. Its superior part is a lateral rotator but the inferior part acts as a medial rotator on the flexed leg when rotated outward and also extends the hip joint. The adductor minimus is an incompletely separated subdivision of the adductor magnus. Its origin forms an anterior part of the magnus and distally it is inserted on the linea aspera above the magnus. It acts to adduct and lateral rotate the femur.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} {{is a statement}} of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Ezcurra (2006) and Ezcurra and Novas (2006), Zupaysaurus can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: the maxillary fenestra is within the antorbital fossa (according to Ezcurra, 2006), the rostral process of the lacrimal is ventrally bowed (according to Ezcurra, 2006), the ventral process of the squamosal is kinked (according to Ezcurra, 2006), wide contact between squamosal and quadratojugal (according to Ezcurra, 2006). The maxillary-jugal ventral margin describes an obtuse angle in lateral view (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a notch on the dorsal margin of the ascending process of the maxilla, relating to horizontal <b>ramus</b> of the lacrimal is rostrally tapering onto the forked caudal tip of the ascending process of the maxilla; (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a lacrimal with a highly pneumatized antorbital recess (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a short and square-shaped retroarticular process of the mandible (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), the cnemial crest is poorly developed (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006).|$|E

500|$|CT {{scanning}} {{shows that}} these openings lead to canals that {{connect to the}} trigeminal nerve, which controls facial sensitivity. The forward-directed canal also splits into the three main branches of the infraorbital nerve, all of which connect to the socket of the canine; the junction occurs about [...] along the canal, another point of variation between the two skulls. The top branch, the external nasal <b>ramus,</b> splits into four branches in the type skull, {{but it does not}} split in the second skull. In other therapsids like Thrinaxodon, Bauria, and Olivierosuchus, the external nasal <b>ramus</b> generally splits into three or more branches. All of these canals would have brought nerves and nutrient-rich tissue to the root of the canines {{and the rest of the}} upper jaw.|$|E
500|$|Nigersaurus did not {{exhibit the}} same {{modifications}} {{seen in the}} jaws of other dinosaurs with dental batteries, or mammals with elaborate chewing functions. The lower jaw was S-shaped and divided into the subcylindrical transverse <b>ramus,</b> which contained the teeth, and the back <b>ramus,</b> which was more lightweight and was the location {{for most of the}} muscle attachments. The jaws also contained several fenestrae, including three that are not present in other sauropods. The front ends of the jaws had grooves that indicate the presence of a keratinous sheath. Nigersaurus is the only known tetrapod animal to have had jaws wider than the skull and teeth that extended laterally across the front. The snout was even broader than those of the [...] "duck-billed" [...] hadrosaurs.|$|E

500|$|The plot of Silver Star Story Complete remains true to the {{original}} Sega CD version written by Kei Shigema. [...] Novelist Keisuke Shigematsu was recruited as the remake's scenario writer, and was tasked with expanding the previous script written by Shigema to make the game more current. As in {{the original}} version, players {{assume the role of}} Alex, a young boy who hopes to become a great hero like his idol, the legendary Dragonmaster Dyne. At the insistence of his fortune-hunting friend <b>Ramus,</b> Alex travels to the nearby Dragon's Cave with his cat-like companion Nall, and sweetheart Luna, to seek a precious gem. When the team reaches the cave's interior, they find Quark, an aged, wise dragon who sees hidden potential in Alex, and beckons him to travel the world and become its protector as the new Dragonmaster. Returning home, the group expresses mutual interest in Alex's quest; <b>Ramus</b> wishes to sell the dragon gem at a large city, Nall wants to find out what he is, and Luna merely to protect Alex. The group sets off across the frontier to the port town of Saith to continue their journey.|$|E
500|$|In {{the course}} of the sixteenth century, a number of philosophers, theologians, and astronomers—among them Francesco Patrizi, Andrea Cisalpino, Peter <b>Ramus,</b> Robert Bellarmine, Giordano Bruno, Jerónimo Muñoz, Michael Neander, Jean Pena, and Christoph Rothmann—abandoned the concept of {{celestial}} spheres. [...] Rothmann argued from the observations of the comet of 1585 that the lack of observed parallax indicated that the comet was beyond Saturn, while the absence of observed refraction indicated the celestial region was of the same material as air, hence there were no planetary spheres.|$|E

After the debate John Sigismund granted funds to the Calvinist publishing house in Debrecen. He also sponsored the establishment of Protestant colleges in Kolozsvár, Marosvásárhely (present-day Târgu Mureș in Romania) and Nagyvárad. His letters to Petrus <b>Ramus</b> and other leading scholars of the Reformation show {{that he wanted to}} develop the royal college in Gyulafehérvár into an academy.

500|$|The holotype (PIN 3141/1) of Alioramus is {{a partial}} skull {{associated}} with three metatarsals. A joint Soviet-Mongolian {{expedition to the}} Gobi Desert in the early 1970s found these remains at a locality known as Nogon-Tsav in the Mongolian province of Bayankhongor. Alioramus was named and described by Russian paleontologist Sergei Kurzanov in 1976. Its crests and low skull profile looked so different from other tyrannosaurids that Kurzanov believed his find was far removed from {{other members of the}} family. Accordingly, he gave it the generic name Alioramus, derived from the Latin alius ('other') and <b>ramus</b> ('branch'), and the specific name A. remotus, which means 'removed' in Latin.
