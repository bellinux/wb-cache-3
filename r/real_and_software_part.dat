40|$|Variants of {{general-purpose}} programming languages, like SystemC, {{are increasingly}} used to specify system designs that have both hardware <b>and</b> <b>software</b> <b>parts.</b> The system-level languages allow a flexible partitioning {{in the design}} of the hardware <b>and</b> <b>software.</b> Moreover, many properties depend on the combination of hardware <b>and</b> <b>software</b> <b>and</b> cannot be verified on either part alone. Existing tools either apply non-formal approaches or handle only the low-level parts of the language. This papers presents a new technique that handles both hardware <b>and</b> <b>software</b> <b>parts</b> of a system description. This is done by automatically partitioning the uniform system description into synchronous (hardware) <b>and</b> asynchronous (<b>software)</b> <b>parts.</b> This technique has been implemented and applied to system level descriptions of several industrial examples. The hardware/software partitioning improves the performance of the verification compared to the monolithic approach. ...|$|R

Due to the constraints and complexity {{in the design}} of embedded systems, it incorporates hardware / software co-design methodology. An embedded system is a combination of hardware <b>and</b> <b>software</b> <b>parts</b> integrated together on a common platform. A soft-core processor which is a hardware description language (HDL) model of a specific processor (CPU) can be customized for any application and can be synthesized for FPGA target.
