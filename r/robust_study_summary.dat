40|$|AbstractA survey {{conducted}} on the EU Notification of New Substances (NONS) database suggested that for industrial chemicals with a profile of low toxicity in (sub) acute toxicity tests there is little added value to {{the conduct of the}} 90 -day repeated dose study. Avoiding unnecessary animal testing is a central aim of the EU REACH chemicals legislation; therefore we sought to verify the profile using additional data. The OECD’s eChemPortal was searched for substances that had both a 28 -day and a 90 -day <b>study</b> and their <b>robust</b> <b>study</b> <b>summaries</b> were then examined from the ECHA CHEM database. Out of 182 substances with high quality 28 -day and 90 -day study results, only 18 reported no toxicity of any kind in the (sub) acute tests. However, for 16 of these there were also no reported signs of toxicity at or close to the limit dose (1000 mg/kgbw/d) in the 90 -day study. Restricting the ‘low (sub) acute toxicity in a high quality dataset’ profile to general industrial chemicals of no known biological activity, whilst allowing irritant substances, increases the data set and improves the prediction to 95 % (20 substances out of 21 substances). The low toxicity profile appears to be of low prevalence within industrial chemicals (10 – 15 %), nevertheless, avoidance of the conduct of a redundant 90 -day study for this proportion of the remaining REACH phase-in substances would avoid the use of nearly 50, 000 animals and save industry 50 million Euros, with no impact on the assessment of human health...|$|R

40|$|Background: {{telemedicine}} has {{the potential}} to improve access to the specialty of geriatric medicine, particularly in rural and remote settings. While telemedicine is widely used in some specialities, this is not yet the case in geriatric medicine. Objective: to review the current literature to identify proven and potential strategies for application of telemedicine in geriatric medical practice. Method: a comprehensive review of literature pertaining to the application of telemedicine in geriatric medicine and relevant related sub-specialties was undertaken. Results: a large number of small studies of limited quality, and a small number of <b>robust</b> <b>studies</b> including randomised trials, were identified. Conclusions: there is evidence to suggest that a variety of telemedicine techniques can be applied effectively and safely in geriatric medicine across a variety of clinical settings.

40|$|Background: The "demand control support" {{model of}} {{workplace}} health may help researchers, practitioners and policy-makers understand how psychosocial interventions can improve workplace health and reduce health inequalities. We conducted a systematic review asking whether organisational-level interventions {{designed to increase}} employee participation in the workplace lead to health effects predicted by the demand control support model. Method: Systematic review, using narrative synthesis, of relevant intervention studies reporting both psychosocial and health outcomes from any country or time, in any language or format, identified from medical and social science databases, personal collections, bibliographies and expert consultations. Findings: We identified 15 studies including single and multiple intervention studies. Most involved …# 732;participatory…# 8482; (problem solving) employee committees. Two of the four more <b>robust</b> <b>studies</b> (prospective with comparison groups) of single participatory interventions found evidence of health (especially mental health) benefits; as did three <b>robust</b> <b>studies,</b> and some less robust evidence, of participatory interventions implemented alongside ergonomic improvements or individual-level health education. We found little evidence of health benefits, but some of adverse effects, when participatory interventions occurred alongside redundancies. The demand control support model was {{a useful tool for}} understanding health outcomes, especially with regards to employee control. Interpretation: Our review suggests that interventions that attempt to increase employee participation and control through workplace re-organisation are potentially health-improving, although more <b>robust</b> <b>studies</b> would strengthen this finding. If such interventions are to benefit employees' health they should be implemented within a favourable organisational climate and cannot be expected to protect workers from generally poor working conditions...|$|R
