40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} study assessed the prevalence and correlates <b>of</b> inconsistent <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> unprotected sex among female sex workers (FSWs) in Armenia. One hundred and eighteen street-based FSWs {{between the ages}} of 20 and 52 completed a questionnaire assessing FSWs’ demographic, psychosocial, and behavioral characteristics. A total of 52. 5 % (n= 62) of FSWs reported inconsistent <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> unprotected sex with clients in the past 3 months. Logistic regression analysis controlling for participants’ age and education revealed that perceiving more barriers toward condom use (AOR = 1. 1; P< 0. 01), reporting more types of abuse (AOR = 2. 1; P< 0. 01), and setting lower fees for service (AOR = 0. 9; P= 0. 02) significantly predicted inconsistent <b>refusal</b> <b>of</b> unprotected sex.
