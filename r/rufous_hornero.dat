5000|$|Five {{subspecies}} of the <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> {{are generally}} recognized, based upon plumage and size: ...|$|E
50|$|In 1816, Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot {{established}} the genus Furnarius in his Analyse d'une nouvelle ornithologie élémentaire and included the <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> on it, although Vieillot {{did not directly}} renamed the <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> as Furnarius rufus. Its current scientific name {{was used for the}} first time in ornithology by John Gould in his Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle in 1841.|$|E

50|$|Predators {{of adult}} and young <b>rufous</b> <b>horneros</b> include {{birds of prey}} such as the black-chested buzzard-eagle Buteo melanoleucus, small mammals, {{domestic}} cats, {{and a number of}} species of snakes and possibly lizards. However, its covered nest probably reduces predation risk.|$|R
50|$|They {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} birds, ranging from 9 to 35 cm in length. While individual species often are habitat specialists, species {{of this family}} {{can be found in}} virtually any Neotropical habitat, ranging from city parks inhabited by <b>rufous</b> <b>horneros,</b> to tropical Amazonian lowlands by many species of foliage-gleaners, to temperate barren Andean highlands inhabited by several species of miners. Two species, the seaside and the surf cinclodes, are associated with rocky coasts.|$|R
50|$|Over 100 {{species of}} birds {{can be found in}} Flores. For example, <b>rufous</b> <b>horneros,</b> with their oven-like nests, can be seen sitting atop fence posts. Huge colonies of green parrots' nests hang high in the tall eucalyptus. Southern lapwings, locally known as teros, {{burrowing}} owls, and elegant-crested tinamou nest in open fields while long wing harriers, gray eagles, and hawks soar high above. Some of the largest great kiskadees are extremely common as are the guira, a type of cuckoo. Along quiet country lanes giant wood rails, pink spoonbills and kingfishers can be seen, alongside flocks of ibis and white egrets in the pastures. Red headed cardinals, both orange throated and red necked woodpeckers, and scissor-tailed nightjars {{can be seen in the}} small stands of trees that dot the countryside. Long, split tailed flycatchers zip above the rich grass around twilight. Glittering-bellied emerald hummingbirds drink from the tall purple flowers that carpet the fields from Spring until Fall.|$|R

50|$|The <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> is a {{national}} emblem of Argentina and Uruguay, two of the several countries it inhabits.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> {{has benefited}} from human changes to the {{environment}} and many live in highly modified habitat, such as city suburbs. In turn abandoned nests may be of benefit to various other species of birds that nest in its unused [...] "ovens". The saffron finch is one species that commonly nests in old ovenbird nests. The <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> is a familiar sight over much of its range and has been adopted as the national bird of Argentina. It is not threatened by human activities and is listed as least concern by the IUCN.|$|E
50|$|Alejo Castex is {{the only}} paved street and it is lined with tall trees and weekend-houses; only can be heard the bird songs of {{thousands}} of rufous-bellied thrushes, chalk-browed mockingbirds, <b>rufous</b> <b>horneros</b> and the far-away roar of tractors working on the farms.Veinte de Junio only counts with a general store, a kindergarten, and a primary and secondary public school; for almost everything the town depends from the nearby city of Pontevedra, in Merlo Partido.For many residents the isolation {{is the cause of}} the lack of development of the town; for many others it’s a blessing because the remoteness makes Veinte de Junio a safe place to live, a place where crime and delinquency are very rare.The town grew around a railway station built {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century by the French-owned company Compagnie Générale de Chemins de Fer dans la Province de Buenos Aires, 4 km from Pontevedra. In fact, by those days the station was known as Estación Pontevedra.The land around the station was urbanized forty years later, in 1947, and it was known as Parque Ibáñez-Estación Pontevedra, but its name changed in 1949 when the partidos boundaries of Merlo and La Matanza were established. The railway station was left within the jurisdiction of La Matanza, while Pontevedra then came within the jurisdiction of Merlo.|$|R
50|$|Nowadays the <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> {{integrates}} {{the genus}} Furnarius with other five species. They are all native to South America and build mud nests that resemble old wood-fired ovens. Its closest relative is the crested hornero, {{which is considered}} as its sister species due to similar behavior and plumage pattern.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> is {{medium-sized}} with {{a square}} tail and very slightly decurved bill. The plumage is overall reddish brown {{with a dull}} brown crown and a whitish throat. Sexes are alike and juvenile birds are slightly paler below (probably because they are cleaner). Rufous horneros feed on insects and other arthropods obtained by foraging on the ground while walking. They sometimes feed on scraps such as bread crumbs. Songs in the <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> are sexually distinct. The rapid trill that is usually heard {{as part of the}} duet is faster in the male, slower in the female, and both beat their wings at their sides while singing and the wings beat {{at the same rate as}} their trill. Thus, while watching an observer may identify the sex by how fast their wings beat while singing.|$|E
50|$|The first notes {{taken on}} the species were made by Philibert Commerson in 1767, from a {{specimen}} obtained at Barragán cove during Louis Antoine de Bougainville's expedition. Commerson named the bird as Turdus fulvus and his notes were later published by Georges Buffon in his Histoire Naturelle in 1779. However, the <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> was first scientifically described, as Merops rufus, by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in the 13th edition of Systema Naturae published in 1788.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> is a {{medium-sized}} ovenbird at 18 to 20 centimetres (7-8 in) and 31 to 58 grams (1.1-2.05 oz), with males being heavier. It has a slender and slightly decurved bill suited to eating insects, which is horn-coloured with {{a length of}} 2.5 centimetres (1.0 in). Wings length is 10.2 centimetres (4 in), with males generally being larger. The tail is short at 7.1 centimetres (2.8 in). The measurements of the species may differ due to the Bergmann's rule.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> (Furnarius rufus) is a {{medium-sized}} ovenbird {{in the family}} Furnariidae It occurs in eastern South America, and is the national bird in Argentina. Also known as the red ovenbird, it is common in savannas, second-growth scrub, pastures and agricultural land and is synanthropic. Its range includes southeastern and southern Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay and northern and central Argentina, extending {{as far south as}} northern Patagonia. The species is most closely related to the crested hornero of Paraguay and Argentina. There are four accepted subspecies.|$|E
50|$|The coastal plateau in Rio Grande do Sul {{features}} {{areas of}} great value in {{the environment of the}} extreme south of Brazil and has formed {{as a result of the}} advance and retreat of the sea. The Taim wetlands contains diverse ecosystems, in lagunal and marine beaches, lagoons, swamps, grasslands and dune ranges and fields.Due to its diverse ecosystems, many species of animals, such as <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero,</b> turtles, tuco-tucos, capybaras, coypus, broad-snouted caimans and a considerable amount of birds are found here.The flora is also very diverse, featuring Ficus, Erythrina crista-galli, Tibouchina, orchids, Bromelia, cacti, rushes and water hyacinths.|$|E
50|$|Typically nesting in cavities, the {{saffron finch}} {{makes use of}} sites such as {{abandoned}} <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> (Furnarius rufus) nests, bamboo branches and under house roofs - this species is tolerant of human proximity, appearing at suburban areas and frequenting bird tables. They have a pleasant but repetitious song which, combined with their appearance, has led to them being kept as caged birds in many areas. Males are polygamous, mating with two females during the nesting season, and territorial, {{which has led to}} the species being used for blood sporting with two males put in a cage in order to fight.|$|E
50|$|Sobradinho {{began with}} a ranch of that name {{belonging}} to the municipality of Formosa, Goiás. According to popular history the name came from {{the existence of an}} old cross built long before 1850 along the banks of a stream near the ranch. On one of the arms of the cross were two little nests of a bird called joão de barro (<b>Rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> - Furnarius rufus), {{one on top of the}} other, forming a little two-story house—a sobradinho in Portuguese. This phenomenon attracted the attention of passersby who took it as a reference point with the name Cross of Sobradinho or Sobradinho of the Cross. As time went by the local stream was called Sobradinho Stream.|$|E
5000|$|Bird nests {{vary from}} simple {{depressions}} {{in the ground}} known as scrapes to largely unstructured collections of branches to elaborately woven pendants or spheres. The megapodes, {{one of the few}} groups who do not directly brood their young, incubate their young in a mound of decomposing vegetation. One species, Macrocephalon maleo, uses volcanic sand warmed by geothermal heat to keep its eggs warm. [...] Among the simple nest builders are falcons, owls, and many shorebirds. The weavers exhibit perhaps the most elaborate nests, complete with strands of grass tied into knots. Most bird nests lie somewhere in the middle, with the majority building cup-shaped nests using some combination of mud, twigs and leaves, and feathers. Some birds, such flamingos and swifts, use saliva to help hold their nest together. The edible-nest swiftlet uses saliva alone to construct their nests. [...] The <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> nest is composed entirely of mud and feces, which is placed on tree branches to allow the sun to harden it into a usable structure. The tailorbirds stitch together leaves to provide cover for their nest sites.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> breeds in the austral summer, laying eggs between August and December, raising nestlings soon after, and {{the young}} may stay in their natal {{territory}} until the following breeding season. The species is monogamous and the pair bond is long term, sometimes for life. The nest of the species is typical for the genus, a large thick clay [...] "oven" [...] placed on a tree, or man made structures such as fenceposts, telephone poles or buildings. Pairs remain together throughout the year and will work on the nest during that time; nests can be constructed {{in as little as}} 5 days but usually take longer, occasionally months, to complete. A clutch generally contains two to four eggs. The eggs are laid every second day and incubated for 14-18 days. Chicks are fed for 23-26 days before fledging; young birds remain in the parental territory for around 6 months after fledging and sometimes until the following breeding season. Both parents incubate eggs and feed the young. Horneros may or may not reuse nests, therefore it is quite common to see several nests close to each other (or even atop older nests) at the same nesting site. However, a formerly unused nest may be repaired for a new breeding season.|$|E
40|$|We herein report human {{dermatitis}} {{caused by}} the tropical fowl mite Ornithonyssus bursa (Berlese). The cases occurred in an apartment in a residential district of Porto Alegre City, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, where {{three members of the}} same family presented with pruritic lesions on the arms and legs. On inspecting the bathroom, several mites measuring approximately 1. 0 mm in length were observed coming from a nest of <b>Rufous</b> <b>Hornero,</b> Furnarius rufus (Gmelin). This is the fi rst report of O. bursa in the urban area of Porto Alegre City, from a nest of F. rufus that bites humans...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The <b>Rufous</b> <b>Hornero</b> (Furnarius rufus) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common bird species in Brazil. Anecdotal {{information}} indicates that nest opening orientation in this species is contrary to wind or rainfall direction. To check for the existence of such a pattern, F. rufus nests were randomly sampled within an urban area in central Brazil to assess whether factors such as wind and vegetation cover influence nest opening orientation. Using circular statistics, no evidence was found that nest-opening orientation was important for the species. These results refuse the expected pattern for tree hollow or enclosed nests. The results suggest that factors such as nesting architecture, nest material, nest microclimate or a combination of these, instead of local climate, must be conditioning nesting behavior in this species...|$|E
40|$|St. Louis {{encephalitis}} virus (SLEV) (Flavivirus) is a reemerging arbovirus in {{the southern}} cone of South America. In 2005, an outbreak of SLEV in central Argentina resulted in 47 human cases with 9 deaths. In Argentina, the ecology of SLEV is poorly understood. Because certain birds are the primary amplifiers in North America, we hypothesized that birds amplify SLEV in Argentina as well. We compared avian SLEV seroprevalence {{in a variety of}} ecosystems in and around Córdoba city from 2004 (before the epidemic) and 2005 (during the epidemic). We also explored spatial patterns to better understand the local ecology of SLEV transmission. Because West Nile virus (WNV) was also detected in Argentina in 2005, all analyses were also conducted for WNV. A total of 980 birds were sampled for detection of SLEV and WNV neutralizing antibodies. SLEV seroprevalence in birds increased 11 -fold from 2004 to 2005. Our study demonstrated that a high proportion (99. 3 %) of local birds were susceptible to SLEV infection immediately prior to the 2005 outbreak, indicating that the vertebrate host population was primed to amplify SLEV. SLEV was found distributed in a variety of environments throughout the city of Córdoba. However, the force of viral transmission varied among sites. Fine scale differences in populations of vectors and vertebrate hosts would explain this variation. In summary, we showed that in 2005, both SLEV {{and to a lesser extent}} WNV circulated in the avian population. Eared Dove, Picui Ground-Dove and Great Kiskadee are strong candidates to amplify SLEV because of their exposure to the pathogen at the population level, and their widespread abundance. For the same reasons, <b>Rufous</b> <b>Hornero</b> may be an important maintenance host for WNV in central Argentina. Competence studies and vector feeding studies are needed to confirm these relationships...|$|E
40|$|La golondrina chilena, Tachycineta meyeni (Cabanis), nidifica en el centro de Chile y suroeste de Argentina. En invierno migra a Bolivia, Paraguay y al sureste de Brasil. Estas golondrinas ocuparon una serie de cajas-nido en Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego. Luego de la temporada de cría, tratamos los nidos con acetato de etilo y los revisamos en búsqueda de artrópodos hematófagos. Encontramos pulgas adultas, que fueron fijadas, aclaradas, deshidratadas, diafanizadas y montadas en un derivado de clavo de olor para su observación al microsocopio óptico. Identificamos machos y hembras de Dasypsyllus (Avesopsylla) lasius lasius (Rothschild). En Argentina, esta pulga es conocida solamente en Sierra de la Ventana (Buenos Aires), donde se la halló parasitando la golondrina barranquera, Notiochelidon cyanoleuca patagonica (Vieillot). La información disponible debería complementarse con prospecciones en localidades intermedias. Otras aves relacionadas con ambas golondrinas por la ocupación de nidos, como el rayadito (Aphrastura spinicauda (Gmelin)), ratona común (Troglodytes aedon Vieillot), caminera común (Geositta cunicularia (Vieillot)), hornero (Furnarius rufus (Gmelin)), podrían contribuir a la dispersión de la pulga entre las dos localidades registradas. Chilean {{swallows}} Tachycineta meyeni (Cabanis) nest in {{the central}} area in Chile and Southwest in Argentina. In winter, they migrate to Bolivia, Paraguay and Southeast of Brazil. A nest box population of Chilean swallows was established in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego. After the breeding season, we collected all nests, treated them with ethyl acetate, and inspected all the nest material for hematophagous arthropods. We found adult fleas, which were fixed, cleared, diaphanized, dehydrated, and mounted in a clove derivative for observation under a microscope. We identified males and females of Dasypsyllus (Avesopsylla) lasius lasius (Rothschild). In Argentina, this flea is only known for Sierra de la Ventana (Buenos Aires), where it was found parasitizing the blue-and-white swallow Notiochelidon cyanoleuca patagonica (Vieillot). This information should be completed with prospecting at intermediate localities. Other birds that occupy nests of both of these swallow species, and which may contribute to flea dispersal between the two recorded localities, include the following: thorn-tailed Aphrastura spinicauda (Gmelin), house wren Troglodytes aedon Vieillot, common miner Geositta cunicularia (Vieillot), and <b>rufous</b> <b>hornero</b> Furnarius rufus (Gmelin) ...|$|E
