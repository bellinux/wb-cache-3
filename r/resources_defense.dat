50|$|Because males defend areas near nesting or {{flowering}} sites, female and/or <b>resource</b> <b>defense</b> polygyny is common. <b>Resource</b> <b>defense</b> polygyny is when males acquire females {{by taking}} control of limited resources such as food and nesting sites. Females can gain access to these resources by mating with the males that defend these territories. Males can copulate with the best mate by defending the best resource because females are more attracted to these better resources. Therefore, the male will mate with multiple females that come to use the resources that the male is defending.|$|R

50|$|The {{territorial}} mating {{behavior of}} male A. manicatum occurs when foraging resources are amassed, allowing for monopolization and defense of territories by individual males. <b>Resource</b> <b>defense,</b> as exhibited by male A. manicatum, has been thought to benefit females by reducing foraging competition for pollen and nectar. The rate a female visits a territory is {{highly correlated with}} the number of flowers in that area. If females forage in sites that are being defended by males and the cost of additional matings is low for female members, then male <b>resource</b> <b>defense</b> and female polyandry may coevolve.|$|R
50|$|Male {{carpenter}} bees do not exhibit {{parental care}} for their offspring and are polygynous. There are three forms of behavior that lead to polygynous behavior: female <b>defense,</b> <b>resource</b> <b>defense,</b> and male dominance polygyny. Males increase their frequency of mating by waiting at places with dense female populations, such as nest sites (female defense) and feeding sites (<b>resource</b> <b>defense).</b> In dense nest aggregations the male patrols the nest site and competes directly for each emerging female. Aggregations with widely spaced nests competition leads to territoriality either at the nest sites or near flowers, depending upon their relative availability.|$|R
25|$|When {{females are}} {{spatially}} stable {{in and around}} a resource, males pursue a <b>resource</b> <b>defense</b> strategy and polygyny occurs when the females are clumped and the offspring require little to no parental care (ex. yellow-bellied marmots, orange-rumped honeyguides).|$|R

Between-group encounters in macaques may involve female <b>resource</b> <b>defense,</b> male mate <b>defense,</b> and male <b>resource</b> <b>defense.</b> We observed between-group encounters in two groups (a forest group and a temple group) of bonnet macaques (Macaca radiata). We observed 102 encounters in 875 h of observation of the forest group (1. 40 per 12 -h day) and 58 encounters in 907 h of observation of the temple group (0. 77 per 12 -h day). Aggressive interactions between groups occurred in 32. 4 % and 29. 3 % of encounters in the forest and temple groups, respectively. Overall, we found little support for the female <b>resource</b> <b>defense</b> hypothesis. Females in both groups rarely participated aggressively in between-group encounters. We found support for the male mate defense hypothesis. For example, males of the forest group were more aggressive during encounters in the mating season than in the non-mating season. Males were also aggressive to females from their own group immediately following encounters. We also found partial support for the male <b>resource</b> <b>defense</b> hypothesis. Encounters in the forest group occurred in a feeding context more often than expected based on time budgets. Also, males in the temple group were more often aggressive in food-related encounters than in other encounters. The findings {{of this study suggest that}} socioecological models of primate social relationships need to distinguish male and female strategies during between-group encounters and integrate the resulting functional outcomes...|$|R
50|$|X. micans {{serves as}} a key example for {{step-wise}} evolution in the Xylocopa genus. Many Xylocopa bees demonstrate <b>resource</b> <b>defense</b> polygyny, and many demonstrate lek polygyny. X. micans {{serves as a}} bridge between the two, exhibiting both states. It serves as an intermediate in terms of mesosomal gland size between those species requiring <b>resource</b> <b>defense</b> polygyny and those species requiring lek polygyny (which need to release pheromones to attract females). X. micans also demonstrates that evolution of sexual dimorphism followed evolution of non-resource defense mating strategies in Xylocopa. Monomorphism is the ancestral state, and X. micans, which shows both mating strategies, have males partially covered in light hairs, showing the beginnings of sexual dimorphism that grows more prominent in species that require lek polygyny.|$|R
50|$|The {{mating system}} of A. manicatum is unlike those {{of most other}} bees. Females exhibit {{polyandry}} and continuously mate throughout their reproductive life. The interval of time between copulations amongst different males can be as short as 35 seconds in length. Males exhibit <b>resource</b> <b>defense</b> polygyny. A. manicatum display extreme polyandry, which is linked to male territoriality and <b>resource</b> <b>defense</b> of flowering plants. Males claim patches of floral plants, ward off conspecific males and other resource competitors, and mate with the females who forage in their territories. Copulations occur repeatedly and regularly in both sexes. Males that are unable to defend their own territory (usually because of their relatively small size) utilize an alternative ‘sneaking’ tactic. These unfit males receive fewer copulation opportunities than females.|$|R

40|$|When {{foraging}} in groups, animals frequently {{use either}} scramble or contest tactics to obtain food at clumps found by others. The question of which competitive tactic {{should be used}} has been addressed from two different perspectives: a simple optimality approach and a game theoretic approach. Surprisingly, both approaches make strikingly different predictions about how per-capita frequency of aggression within groups should change {{as a function of}} food abundance and competitor density. <b>Resource</b> <b>defense</b> theory typically predicts dome-shaped relationships between the per-capita frequency of aggression and both food abundance and competitor density, whereas game theoretic models predict an increase in aggression with competitor density and a decline in aggression with increased food abundance. We developed a game theoretic model to explore whether the predictions of <b>resource</b> <b>defense</b> theory and the game theoretic approach can be reconciled. Our model assumes that players have different competitive abilities and can adopt roles of either finder or joiner that affect the quantity of food that can be gained from a food clump. In accordance with earlier game theoretic models, we predict an increase in aggression with com-petitor density when animals compete by pair-wise contests. However, when food clumps can be challenged by more than one competitor, both {{the costs and benefits of}} defending increase with competitor density, which results in a dome-shaped relation-ship between the two variables.
