40|$|The incompleteness of {{proteome}} {{structure and}} function annotation is a critical problem for biologists and, in particular, severely limits interpretation of high-throughput and next-generation experiments. We have developed a proteome annotation pipeline based on structure prediction, where function and structure annotations are generated using an integration of sequence comparison, fold recognition, and grid-computing-enabled de novo structure prediction. We predict protein domain boundaries and three-dimensional (3 D) structures for protein domains from 94 genomes (including human, Arabidopsis, <b>rice,</b> <b>mouse,</b> fly, yeast, Escherichia coli, and worm). De novo structure predictions were distributed on a grid of more than 1. 5 million CPUs worldwide (World Community Grid). We generated significant numbers of new confident fold annotations (9 % of domains that are otherwise unannotated in these genomes). We demonstrate that predicted structures can be combined with annotations from the Gene Ontology database to predict new and more specific molecular functions...|$|E
40|$|Neurospora crassa is a {{filamentous}} fungus {{that has been}} extensively studied as a model organism for eukaryotic biology, providing fundamental insights into cellular processes such as cell signaling, growth and differentiation. To advance {{in the study of}} this multicellular organism, an understanding of the specific mechanisms for protein transport into the cell nucleus is essential. Importin-alpha (Imp-alpha) is the receptor for cargo proteins that contain specific nuclear localization signals (NLSs) that {{play a key role in}} the classical nuclear import pathway. Structures of Imp-a from different organisms (yeast, <b>rice,</b> <b>mouse,</b> and human) have been determined, revealing that this receptor possesses a conserved structural scaffold. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the Imp alpha mechanism of action may vary significantly for different organisms or for different isoforms from the same organism. Therefore, structural, functional, and biophysical characterization of different Impa proteins is necessary to understand the selectivity of nuclear transport. Here, we determined the first crystal structure of an Impa from a {{filamentous fungus}} which is also the highest resolution Impa structure already solved to date (1. 75 angstrom). In addition, we performed calorimetric analysis to determine the affinity and thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between Impa and the classical SV 40 NLS peptide. The comparison of these data with previous studies on Impa proteins led us to demonstrate that N. crassa Imp-alpha possess specific features that are distinct from mammalian Imp-alpha but exhibit important similarities to rice Imp-alpha, particularly at the minor NLS binding site...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background High-density short {{oligonucleotide}} microarrays {{are useful}} tools for studying biodiversity, {{because they can}} be used to investigate both nucleotide and expression polymorphisms. However, when different strains (or species) produce different signal intensities after mRNA hybridization, {{it is not easy to}} determine whether the signal intensities were affected by nucleotide or expression polymorphisms. To overcome this difficulty, nucleotide and expression polymorphisms are currently examined separately. Results We have developed SNEP, a new method that allows simultaneous detection of both nucleotide and expression polymorphisms. SNEP involves a robust statistical procedure based on the idea that a nucleotide polymorphism observed at the probe level can be regarded as an outlier, because the nucleotide polymorphism can reduce the hybridization signal intensity. To investigate the performance of SNEP, we used three species: barley, <b>rice</b> and <b>mice.</b> In addition to the publicly available barley data, we obtained new <b>rice</b> and <b>mouse</b> data from the strains with available genome sequences.

With the rapidly increasing throughputs and decreasing costs of next generation sequencing, RNA-Seq has gained in popularity; but given the typically short reads (e. g. 2 x 90 bp paired ends) of this technol- ogy, de novo assembly to recover complete or full-length transcript sequences remains an algorithmic challenge.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between the structure of genes and their expression {{is a relatively new}} aspect of genome organization and regulation. With more genome sequences and expression data becoming available, bioinformatics approaches can help the further elucidation of the relationships between gene structure and gene expression. This will contribute to our understanding of a yet deeper level of gene regulation in higher eukaryotes. This thesis focuses on two issues of genome organization in relationship to expression. The genomic configuration involved in coexpression of neighboring genes is investigated (chapters 3 + 4) and the genome-wide relationships between structural parameters of a gene and its expression are analyzed (chapters 5 + 6). A short introduction (chapter 1) outlines the motivation and structure of this thesis. This is followed by an overview of issues that need to be considered in the study of gene and genome structure in relation to gene expression (chapter 2). DNA configuration in the nucleus is summarized and concepts as gene, chromatin and higher order domains are presented {{in the context of the}} measurement of gene expression and gene regulation. Special attention is given to the characteristics and functions of introns in the genomes of higher eukaryotes. Expression of genes in eukaryotic genomes is known to cluster in domains, but domain size is generally loosely defined and highly variable. The concept of local coexpression domain is introduced and defined as set of physically adjacent genes that are highly coexpressed (chapter 3). The Arabidopsis thaliana genome was analyzed for the presence of such local coexpression domains and their functional characteristics were investigated. Public domain expression data from the Massively Parallel Signature Sequencing (MPSS) repository that cover a range of different experimental conditions, organs, tissues and cells and microarray data (Affymetrix) from a detailed analysis of gene expression in root were used. With these expression data, we identified 689 (MPSS) and 1481 (microarray) local coexpression domains consisting of 2 to 4 genes with a pair-wise Pearson's correlation coefficient larger than 0. 7. This number is about 2 to 5 -fold higher than the numbers expected by chance on the basis of genome randomizations. A small (5 - 10 %) yet significant fraction of genes in the Arabidopsis genome is therefore organized into local coexpression domains. These local coexpression domains were apparently randomly distributed over the genome. Genes in such local domains were for the major part not categorized in the same functional category (GOslim). Neither tandemly duplicated genes, nor a s hared promoter sequence, or gene distance fully explained the occurrence of coexpression of genes in such chromosomal domains. This indicates that other parameters in genes or gene positions are important to establish coexpression of genes in local domains of Arabidopsis. The analytical approach was extended to the analysis of the occurrence of local coexpression domains in the genome of rice (Oryza sativa), the monocotyledonous model plant (chapter 4). Also in the rice genome, there is a small, yet significant number of local coexpression domains that for the major part were not categorized in the same functional category (GOslim). The various configuration parameters studies could not fully explain the occurrence of local coexpression domains. The regulation of coexpression is therefore thought to be regulated at the level of chromatin structure. The characteristics of the local coexpression domains in rice are strikingly similar to such domains in the Arabidopsis genome. Yet, no microsynteny between local coexpresion domains in Arabidopsis and rice could be identified (chapter 4). Although the rice genome is not yet as extensively annotated as the Arabidopsis genome, the lack of conservation of local coexpression domains indicates that such domains have not played a major role in evolution. In chapter 5, the relationships between the structure of a primary transcript and the expression level of the gene were investigated to identify the parameters and mechanisms that have helped shaping such relationships. In both monocotyledonous rice and dicotyledonous Arabidopsis, highly expressed genes were shown to have more and longer introns, as well as a larger primary transcript than lowly expressed genes. It is concluded that higher expressed genes tend to be less compact than lower expressed genes. In animal genomes, it is reported to be the other way round. Although the length differences in plant genes are much smaller than in animals, these findings indicate that plant genes are in this respect different from animal genes. Explanations for the {{relationship between}} gene configuration and gene expression in animals may be (or may have been) less important in plants. We speculate that selection, if any, on genome configuration has taken a different turn after the divergence of plants and animals. To be able to exclude that the methodological differences were the reason for the reported differences between plant and animal gene structure and expression relationships, a comparative genomics study of five widely diverged genomes was undertaken (chapter 6). The relationships between gene structure and gene expression were analyzed for five genomes (Arabidopsis, <b>rice,</b> worm, <b>mouse,</b> human), using public domain MPSS and affymetrix microarray (for worm) expression data sets that cover a wide variety of tissues and conditions. Five different parameters of gene structure were examined with the help of rank-based methods: the number of introns, as well as the total length of introns, combined untranslated regions, coding sequence and the combined total length of the primary transcript. In addition, the broadness or breadth of expression is evaluated. The methods of analyses were identical for all genomes considered. It was found that tissue specific genes, defined as genes that are expressed in only one (or at most a few) tissues/conditions, are among the more compact genes in all genomes evaluated. Moreover, in plants the higher expressed genes tend to be longer and less compact than the lower expressed genes, whereas in the mammalian genomes analyzed the trend is the opposite. Worm takes an intermediate position. The different genomes differ markedly in the details of the relationship between expression and structure for the genes that are in the middle class of expression level. As the major difference in genome configuration is the absolute length of introns, possible explanations for the contrasting trends in plant and mammalian genomes question the role and evolutionary history of introns. Possibly there is a threshold amount of intron number and/or size upon which selection acts that differs between genomes. Alternatively, some groups of plant introns have been introduced in plant genomes well after the split between animals and plants. The results of the research presented in this thesis are considered in the context and future prospects of the wider, more detailed and more comparative analyses of the relationships between gene structure and gene expression in the genomes of higher eukaryotes (chapter 7) ...|$|R
