By March 1896, $95,000 was raised in New York City, in Boston $40,000, and in Philadelphia there was enough anxiety about not keeping pace with rival cities that the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the $15,000 it had already raised was not nearly enough. By the end of the year-long drive, Americans had raised more than $300,000 in an age when a loaf of bread cost a nickel.|$|E
5000|$|A {{safety notch}} {{is one of}} the oldest forms of drop safety, used on older single-action revolvers {{manufactured}} before the invention of the hammer block, some lever-action rifles, 1911-pattern guns, and hammer-fired semi-automatics that were designed before the invention of the firing pin block. The safety notch is a <b>relief</b> <b>cut</b> made in the tumbler at the base of the hammer, that allows the sear to catch and hold the hammer a short distance from the pin or cartridge primer, in a [...] "half-cocked" [...] position. The safety notch works first by allowing the handler to retract the hammer a short distance from the firing pin or primer, such that dropping the firearm on its hammer will not result in an energy transfer to the pin or spur, which could then discharge a chambered cartridge. A second purpose is to allow the sear to [...] "catch" [...] a hammer that is falling when the trigger has not been pulled, such as in cases where a drop jarred the sear loose or when the hammer was not fully cocked before being released. However, a safety notch used to [...] "half-cock" [...] a firearm is an active feature that must be engaged, and does not positively prevent accidental discharges in all cases. A certain amount of manual dexterity and familiarity with a firearm is also required to [...] "half-cock" [...] a firearm; unfamiliarity with how to engage the [...] "half-cock" [...] position can result in accidental discharges. Moreover, safety notch and [...] "half-cock" [...] style safeties are prone to breakage which can result in unintentional discharges leading to severe personal injuries or death.|$|E
40|$|During {{the years}} 1936 - 1937, Joseph Hackin, then D. A. F. A.

The whole {{was thought to be}} a treasure and to belong to Kanishka, the famous king ot the Kushan dynasty supposed to have been living in the second century A. D. The objects unearthed were partly alloted to Kabul, partly to Paris. However, in spite of the two major publications issued in 1939 and 1954 (the second World war occurred in-between), not much has been made since to ascertain these first interpretations. The present article is devoted to a new approach of one of the three types of designs displayed on the Begram collection of glasses held in musée Guimet, i. e. the cut and engraved type. The diamond cut, high <b>relief</b> <b>cut</b> and linear or figurative engraved glasses are carefully examined and compared to their extant parallels so as to make out both their date and place of production. The first data gathered well seem to point to {{the second half of the}} first century A. D. which is rather earlier than imagined first, and, to Egypt. Further informations, we hope, will complete and confirm these investigations once the painted and peculiar glass threads' decorated vessels have been studied. Delacour Catherine.

40|$|The Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta {{is one of}} California’s most {{important}} geographic regions. It supports significant agricultural, urban, and ecological systems and delivers water to two-thirds of the state’s population, but faces extremely high risks of disaster. Largely below sea level and supported by 1, 100 miles of aging dikes and levees, the Delta system is subject to frequent flooding. Jurisdictional and financial disincentives to better flood planning prevent coordination that might otherwise reduce both costs and damages. This study highlights one possible flood mitigation technique called a <b>relief</b> <b>cut,</b> which is an intentional break in a downslope levee to allow water that has overtopped or breached an upslope levee to drain back into the river. This flood management technique is "smart" when located in appropriate areas so that floodwaters can be managed most efficiently and safely after a levee break. We identify four key constraints and make four recommendations for flood management planning. The constraints are: 1) Perception of flood risk [...] The public believes that levees will protect them from all flood events; 2) Perverse incentives [...] For reclamation districts to finance levee maintenance and flood planning, they must encourage development in flood risk areas to collect assessment fees; 3) Litigation threat [...] Agencies remain vulnerable to litigation after a flood which is a disincentive for taking action because no one wants the blame; and 4) Reimbursement uncertainty [...] Historical flood accounts demonstrate local entities are not always reimbursed for their expenditures which discourages quick action during a flood. We recommend the following actions for agency officials to endorse and the public to support: 1) Acknowledge that levees will fail and plan accordingly; 2) Explicitly plan for emergencies such as relief cuts before the flood occurs; 3) Support interagency cooperation, and 4) Apply Full Cost Recovery concept from the European Union Water Framework Directive...|$|E

50|$|In 282, while Persia was {{in civil}} war, the Roman Emperor Carus crossed the Euphrates {{along with his}} troops and invaded Mesopotamia wreaking havoc.

Mesopotamia was ravaged and the city of Ctesiphon was occupied by the Roman troops. However, as an oracle had predicted earlier, the death of Carus cut short his career as well as the Roman advance. Following Carus's death, the Romans retreated, Bahram retook Mesopotamia. In 283 Bahram II defeated his brother in Sakastan, and had the latter executed and replaced with his own son Bahram III as the governor of Sakastan.

5000|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to the}} {{relative}} manufacturing quality of each nation's SKS production. The Chinese SKSs varied significantly even among new rifles with some having screwed in barrels, milled trigger groups and bolt carriers with lightening <b>reliefs</b> <b>cut</b> into them being at the top end and cheaper rifles having pinned barrels, stamped trigger groups and slab-sided bolt carriers - though overall quality and serviceability remained high. The main reason for the manufacturing variance comes from differences between rifles made for the Chinese army and those made for export. Yugoslav types are {{generally considered to be}} better made than Chinese export rifles when new, but this is often negated by the poor condition they are in due to hard use and neglect [...] The Chinese types typically have chrome-lined barrels while the Yugoslav versions do not, resulting in some Yugoslavian carbines having bores in considerably worse condition than even the cheapest Chinese SKSs. The Yugo M59/66 rifles also are unique in having a gas shut off valve for grenade launching, which is a common source of malfunctions. While often encountered in well-used condition, Romanian carbines were as well-built as the Soviet versions. In general, carbines made in the USSR are considered the highest quality.|$|R
