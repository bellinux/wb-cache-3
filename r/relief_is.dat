5|$|The Burney Relief (also {{known as}} the Queen of the Night <b>relief)</b> <b>is</b> a Mesopotamian {{terracotta}} plaque in high relief of the Isin-Larsa- or Old-Babylonian period, depicting a winged, nude, goddess-like figure with bird's talons, flanked by owls, and perched upon two lions.|$|E
25|$|Pre-Hispanic <b>reliefs</b> <b>are</b> general lineal {{in design}} and low, medium and high <b>reliefs</b> can <b>be</b> found. While this {{technique}} is often favored for narrative scenes elsewhere in the world, Mesoamerican reliefs {{tend to focus on}} a single figure. The only time <b>reliefs</b> <b>are</b> used in the narrative sense <b>is</b> when several <b>relief</b> steles <b>are</b> placed together. The best <b>relief</b> work <b>is</b> from the Mayas, especially from Yaxchilan.|$|R
50|$|After {{the passing}} of the Elizabethan Poor Law (1601), outdoor <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> the kind of poor <b>relief</b> where {{assistance}} <b>was</b> in the form of money, food, clothing or goods, given to alleviate poverty without the requirement that the recipient enter an institution. In contrast, recipients of indoor <b>relief</b> <b>were</b> required to enter a workhouse or poorhouse. Outdoor <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> also a feature of the Scottish and Irish Poor Law systems.|$|R

5|$|Close to the {{controversial}} cave are other monuments. One {{of them is}} a small shrine consisting of a 7th-century rock carving of Anantashayana Vishnu, or reclining Vishnu with Lakshmi and Garuda in namaste posture. Vishnu is shown restarting the cosmic cycle by giving birth to all of existence. Above the reclining carved relief are the ten avatars of Vishnu – Matsya, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krishna, Buddha and Kalki. Between the Narasimha and Vamana is shown a relief of Brahma cord connected to Vishnu's navel. To the left of the <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> depicted the Trinity – Vishnu, Shiva and Brahma, while to the right is a human couple and a mother cow with a calf feeding.|$|E
5|$|The <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> {{displayed}} in the British Museum in London, which has dated it between 1800 and 1750BCE. It originates from southern Mesopotamia, but the exact find-site is unknown. Apart from its distinctive iconography, the piece is noted for its high relief and relatively large size, which suggest that it {{was used as a}} cult relief, making it a very rare survival from the period. However, whether it represents Lilitu, Inanna/Ishtar, or Ereshkigal is under debate. The authenticity of the object has been questioned from its first appearance in the 1930s, but opinion has generally moved in its favour over the subsequent decades.|$|E
5|$|The <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> in a {{dilapidated}} condition {{with most of}} the arms and legs broken. He is seated in padmasana lost in his meditation. His posture is well formed and suggests that the 6th century artist knew this asana. He sits on a lotus with a stalk shown as if coming out of the earth, his legs are crossed symmetrically. Two Nagas flank the lotus and express their reverence with a namaste posture. The great yogi is being approached by various Vedic and Puranic gods and goddesses, as well as monks and sadhus, yet there is a halo around him that keeps them at bay, as if they admire it but do not wish to disturb his meditation.|$|E
5000|$|The Arslan Tash <b>reliefs</b> <b>are</b> bas-reliefs {{of people}} and animals on {{the gates of the}} city and temple. The dating of the <b>reliefs</b> <b>is</b> uncertain, though one {{contains}} an inscription of Tiglath-Pileser III of the Neo-Assyrian Empire ...|$|R
50|$|In 2016, Susquenita School District {{approved}} 3,986 homestead properties received $190 each. The <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> {{subtracted from}} {{the property tax}} bill. The increase in <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> due to fewer local property owners participating in the program than in 2010.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, the Greenwood School District {{property}} tax <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> set at $124 for 1,655 approved homesteads. In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Greenwood School District was $131 per approved permanent primary residence. In Perry County, the highest tax <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> $194 for residents of Newport School District. In Greenwood School District, the tax <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> set at $131 for the 1,574 property owners who {{applied for the}} tax relief in 2009. In Perry County, 88% of eligible property owners applied for {{property tax}} relief in 2009. Among the 500 districts in the Commonwealth, the highest property tax <b>relief</b> <b>was</b> given to Chester Upland School District at $632 in 2010 and in 2009.|$|R
5|$|Greg Retallack's {{hypothesis}} that Ediacaran organisms were lichens is not widely {{accepted by the}} scientific community. He argues that the fossils are not as squashed as known fossil jellyfish, and their <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> closer to compressed woody branches whose compaction can be estimated as compressed cylinders. He points out the chitinous walls of lichen colonies would provide a similar resistance to compaction, and claims the large size of the organisms (up to 1.5 metres long, far larger {{than any of the}} preserved burrows) also hints against classification with animals. Finally, Ediacaran fossils from classic localities of the Flinders Ranges have been found in growth position within red calcareous and gypsiferous paleosols, interpreted as soils of well-drained temperate desert soils. Such habitats limit interpretive options for fractal Ediacaran fossils such as Dickinsonia to lichenised or unlichenised fungi, but other Ediacaran fossils could have been slime moulds or microbial colonies.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July, Mickl wrote {{a letter}} in which he stated that he wished to again be a {{battalion}} or regimental commander, so as to not {{have to deal with}} such a large frontline. That day he had been told that the next day he should expect Choltitz to return and take over command, but instead he spent a further three weeks commanding the 11th Panzer Division in heavy fighting against Soviet attacks. Finally, on 12 August he received a message advising that he was to be relieved by Generalmajor Wend von Wietersheim, who arrived that same day. Four days later, Mickl returned to Gera, disappointed and resentful about the demotion, as he felt that he had made a good enough impression during the fighting to be retained as commander of the division. The reason behind his <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> unclear. His performance commanding the division had not been markedly worse than comparable divisional commanders during the preceding battles, and it is possible that Wehrmacht or Army Headquarters had decided Mickl was better suited to fighting insurgents in his native Balkans, especially given his fluency in several local languages.|$|E
5|$|Overall, the <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> in {{excellent}} condition. It was originally received in three pieces and some fragments by the British Museum; after repair, some cracks are still apparent, in particular a triangular piece missing {{on the right}} edge, but the main features of the deity and the animals are intact. The figure's face has damage to its left side, {{the left side of}} the nose and the neck region. The headdress has some damage to its front and right hand side, but the overall shape can be inferred from symmetry. Half of the necklace is missing and the symbol of the figure held in her right hand; the owls' beaks are lost and a piece of a lion's tail. A comparison of images from 1936 and 2005 shows that some modern damage has been sustained as well: the right hand side of the crown has now lost its top tier, and at the lower left corner a piece of the mountain patterning has chipped off and the owl has lost its right-side toes. However, in all major aspects, the relief has survived intact for more than 3,500years.|$|E

5|$|The WHO {{guidelines}} recommend prompt {{oral administration}} of drugs when pain occurs, starting, {{if the person}} is not in severe pain, with non-opioid drugs such as paracetamol, dipyrone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors. Then, if complete pain <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> not achieved or disease progression necessitates more aggressive treatment, mild opioids such as codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine or tramadol are added to the existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until the person is painless or the maximum possible relief without intolerable side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe cancer pain, this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who engage}} in self-harm face the {{contradictory}} reality of harming themselves {{while at the same}} time obtaining relief from this act. It may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting, but they often do because they know the relief that will follow. For some self-harmers this <b>relief</b> <b>is</b> primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain. Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many self-harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self-harming and, for some, deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.|$|E
