50|$|There {{is also a}} food-entrainable {{biological}} clock, {{which is}} not confined to the suprachiasmatic nucleus. The location of this clock has been disputed. Working with mice, however, Fuller et al. concluded that the food-entrainable clock seems to be located in the dorsomedial hypothalamus. During <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding,</b> it takes over control of such functions as activity timing, increasing the chances of the animal successfully locating food resources.|$|E
50|$|A {{key feature}} of clocks is {{their ability to}} {{synchronize}} to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body {{raises the question of}} how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding).</b> Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.|$|E
50|$|Schibler and {{his colleagues}} have also studied {{mechanisms}} by which peripheral oscillators are synchronized within the body. In 2000, they conducted experiments on the effects of <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> time on mice and observed that the phase of peripheral oscillators - but not that of the SCN - gradually adapted to imposed feeding-fasting rhythms within a week or two. These results showed that feeding time functions as a potent Zeitgeber for peripheral cells, but not for the SCN. Schibler and colleagues posited that the SCN can synchronize peripheral clocks simply by imposing rest-activity cycles, which in turn drive feeding-fasting cycles. However, in the meantime they discovered additional pathways involved in the phase-resetting of peripheral clocks, such as signaling by glucocorticoid hormones, body temperature, and actin dynamics.|$|E

The study used 37 ICR male mice each mated with 4 females except for one male with 5 females. Once a female had a vaginal plug, she was removed from the male and placed into her own cage. Pregnant females were allocated to four groups: full feed-normal temperature, full feed-chilled temperature, restricted feed-normal temperature, and restricted feed-chilled temperature (n = 18, 19, 23 and 16, respectively). The <b>restricted</b> <b>feed</b> females were fed 80 % of their previous five day's average intake from day 5 to 10 of gestation while full feed females were fed ad libitum. All females were fed ad libitum from day 10 to 18. On day 14 the chilled temperature females were moved to an 18 °C environmental chamber while the normal temperature females were housed at 22 °C. On day 18 the females were sacrificed and the fetal weight, respective fetus's decidual weight, and number of corpora lutea and implantations were recorded. During restriction, intake of restricted mice was 68 % of full feed mice. Immediately after restriction, there was a compensatory increase in intake by restricted mice, but overall, restricted mice consumed 93. 8 % that of full feed mice. There were no significant differences in survival rates among the four groups.

In the present study we investigated the effects of nighttime <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> (Ensure only, 2 h/night) and nighttime restricted treats (Ensure 2 h/night+free access to chow) in order to determine whether these effects were dependent on the time of day the meal was provided. We found that nighttime <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding,</b> like daytime <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding,</b> shifted the rhythm of PER 2 expression in the BNSTov and CEA and peak expression was observed approximately 12 h after the mealtime.

40|$|When food-access is {{restricted}} to a consistent time of day (<b>restricted</b> <b>feeding),</b> rodents reorganize many circadian behaviors around the mealtime. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the master circadian pacemaker, while the oval nucleus of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST-OV) and the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) are important in stress, motivation and feeding. All these regions express the 'clock protein' Period 2 (PER 2) with a circadian rhythm. <b>Restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> changes PER 2 expression patterns in the BNST-OV and CEA, {{but not in the}} SCN. To test the relative importance of motivational and homeostatic variables on PER 2 expression in the BNST-OV and CEA, we contrasted daily <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> (containing homeostatic and motivational components) with daily restricted treats (no weight loss, a motivational challenge only). <b>Restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> was comprised of fasted animals receiving repeated daily access to chocolate Ensure, whereas restricted treats consisted of sated animals receiving similar Ensure-access.

A total of 240 one-day-old dual purpose Koekoek chicks were randomly distributed into 12 experimental pens, representing 4 feeding treatments to evaluate the performance of chicks on body weight and age at onset of laying eggs (AOLE), egg quality, and carcass parameters. Treatments were control (unrestricted feed), R 7 - 28 (<b>restricted</b> <b>feed</b> at 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25 and 28 days of age), R 35 - 56 (<b>restricted</b> <b>feed</b> at 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 53 and 56 days of age) and R 63 - 84 (<b>restricted</b> <b>feed</b> at 63, 66, 69, 72, 75, 78, 81 and 84 days of age) groups. The results showed a significant difference between the control and R 63 - 84 group's birds in both daily and total feed consumption (P < 0. 05). There was a significant (P < 0. 05) difference in body weight at the end of the starter period, where R 63 - 84 group's birds had a heavier body weight and body weight gain than R 7 - 28 and R 35 - 56 groups' birds, but not control birds. Yolk diameter was significantly lower in R 35 - 56 group than R 7 - 28 and R 63 - 84 groups (P < 0. 05). Feed restriction also did not affect slaughter and dressed weight, but the eviscerated weight was significantly lower in R 35 - 56 and R 63 - 84 groups than control (P < 0. 05). Feed restriction was associated with production costs of the treatments, and the feeding regime of R 63 - 84 group significantly decreased the amount of feed consumed by birds (P < 0. 05). Thus, feed restriction during 63 to 84 days of age (R 63 - 84 group) can be useful because of improving the production profitability of rearing chicks without affecting the AOLE, body weight at AOLE, egg weight, and carcass parameters...|$|R

At slaughter, the elbow, hock, and knee joints were harvested. Joints were scored macroscopically for articular surface deformations indicative of OC. Gilts in the RA treatment had significantly higher odds to be affected with OC than gilts in the RR and AR treatments in the hock joint (OR = 3. 3, P = 0. 04 and OR = 8. 5, P = 0. 002, respectively), and at animal level (OR = 2. 5, P = 0. 001 and OR = 1. 9, P = 0. 01, respectively).

40|$|Food {{availability}} is {{a potent}} environmental cue that directs circadian locomotor activity in rodents. Even though nocturnal rodents prefer to forage at night, daytime food anticipatory activity (FAA) is observed prior to short meals presented at a scheduled time of day. Under this <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> regimen, rodents exhibit two distinct bouts of activity, a nocturnal activity rhythm that is entrained to the light-dark cycle and controlled by the master clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and a daytime bout of activity that is phase-locked to mealtime.

During the 104 days of the experimental period, the group under <b>restrict</b> <b>feeding</b> had access to pastures for 3. 5 hours daily whereas the group with ad libitum feeding remained on pasture full time. Forage intake was estimated in two trials by using the double-indicator method. Values of NEm, MEm, k m and k g were estimated on the basis of empty body weight (EBW) through linear and non-linear model fitting. Requirements of NEm and MEm did not differ among Nellore and crossbred animals. In the linear model, the following results were obtained: Requirements of NEm = 86 kcal/kg 0. 75; requirements of MEm = 136 kcal/kg 0. 75 and k m = 0. 63. Kg value was higher for Nellore animals (0. 39) than for crossbred animals (k g = 0. 33). Requirement of net energy of maintenance does not differ among grazing Nellores and ½ European-Nellore crossbred. For the same body weight, Nellore animals present greater fat proportion in gain composition than ½European-Nelore crossbred...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Rainbow trout (104. 8 ± 0. 15 g), Oncorhynchus mykiss, {{were fed}} a {{commercial}} extruded pellet for 7 weeks {{to investigate the}} effect of <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> on performances. Three <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> were tested: two day intervals (TDI), every other day (EOD) and twice a day (TD). Fish were held in fresh water at 9 - 13 °C from January 16 to March 4, 2004. Feed conversion rate (FCR) were TDI and TD groups 1. 33 ± 0. 03 and EOD group 1. 54 ± 0. 03, protein efficiency ratio (PER) were TDI group 1. 88 ± 0. 04, EOD group 1. 59 ± 0. 03 and TD group 1. 85 ± 0. 04, respectively. Although FCR was the same between TDI and TD, {{there was a significant}} differences in weight gain, relative growth rate (RGR) and specific growth rate (SGR) between the groups. These group evaluated the food at the same rate but since the given food amount were different, the weight gain, SGR and RGR of TD were the highest dependent to the food amount. Although the FCR was good in restricted fed fish, the taken feed amount sigificantly affected the growth parameters of fish. Relative growth rate (RGR), weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) were lower in TDI and EOD groups. Both specific growth rate and relative growth rate increased with number of <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding.</b> The <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> influenced the chemical composition of the fish. The lipid, moisture and protein content of fish increased when the fish were fd twice a day (TD group). In terms of SGR and RGR, it can be concluded that the best growth rate was obtained from the fish fed twice a day (TD) and every other day (EOD) feeding for rainbow trout at 9 - 13 ºC...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether there exists a critical period during rearing when <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> of broiler breeder hens can be most beneficial on subsequent egg production. Broiler breeder pullets were subjected to combinations of either ad libitum or <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> during three periods before sexual maturity. Body weight gain, feed intake, and egg production were recorded. Ovary and oviduct weights were noted at age of first oviposition. At 15 and 18 wk of age and at age of first oviposition, chicken luteinizing hormone releasing hormone-I (cLHRH-I) in the median eminence and the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the pituitary and plasma were determined. The results demonstrated that alternation between ad libitum and <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> during rearing changed the growth curves of the birds. Feed restriction from 7 to 15 wk followed by either ad libitum or <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> led to improved reproductive performance, suggesting that long-term feed restriction may not be necessary to attain good reproductive performance. The birds restricted from 7 to 15 wk of age had higher proportional weights of ovary (> or = 1. 7 %) and oviduct (> or = 1. 58 %) at age of sexual maturity. The cLHRH-I levels in the median eminence and gonadotrophin contents in the pituitary followed that of growth in response to feeding levels and timing of feeding and could be related to the timing of the onset of lay. At age of first egg, all groups had similar levels of cLHRH-I, LH, and FSH. However, no clear effect of level of feed intake or time period of restriction could be observed for plasma LH or FSH concentrations. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aim of this}}  was to {{evaluate}} the effects of food restriction on metabolic aspects (bloodchemistry parameters) in Ettawa crossbred goats. Four adult male and clinically healthy Ettawa crossbredgoats were used in this study. The animals were kept in individual cage for 12 weeks. Animal feed consistedof aerial part of peanut plant and concentrate {{at a ratio of}} 60 : 40. The experiment was devided into 2 phases of feeding periods, fullfeeding (ad libitum  feeding and <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding.</b> After the adaptationperiod for 4 weeks (week 1 - 4), the animals were fed ad libitum for 4 weeks (week 5 - 8), and then continuedwith 50 % of the ad libitum feed intake during the following 4 weeks <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> period (week 9 - 12). During the experiment, drinking water was supplied ad libitum. Body weight were examined and bloodsamples were collected {{at the end of the}} fullfeeding and <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> periods for blood chemistryanalyses. Statistical differences were determined by paired t-Test at probability level of 0. 05. This studyshowed that feed restriction up to about 50 % of ad libitum (80 % of maintenance) feed intake resulted inchanges of blood chemistry parameters. At the end of <b>restricted</b> <b>feeding</b> period, the elevated concentrationof serum inorganic phosphate, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and cholesterine were observed and reducedconcentration of glucose, calcium, and triglyceride were observed. However no change was observed on  levelof arterial blood pH and the concentration of serum natrium, potassium, chloride, and protein. In conclusion,nutritional status has significant effect on blood chemistry parameters of Ettawa crossbred goats. Seruminorganic phosphate, calcium, creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, cholesterine, glucose, and triglycerideconcentration could provide the more reliable information for assessment of the nutritional status ofEttawa crossbred goat...|$|E
40|$|In {{two studies}} mice were fed diets {{containing}} either a mixture of, or individual {{conjugated linoleic acid}} (CLA) isomers in {{the presence or absence}} of essential fatty acids. Mice fed the C 18 : 2 Δ 10, 12 CLA isomer lost as much body fat as those fed a mixture of isomers. This effect was not caused by the C 18 : 2 Δ 9, 11 isomer (predominant in beef) or by <b>restricted</b> <b>feed</b> intake. The loss was much greater in mice consuming an essential fatty acid deficient diet versus a control diet. This supports our hypothesis that for CLA to deplete body fat, it must first be metabolized in a manner similar to linoleic acid. Furthermore, we suggest that the loss of body fat may be mediated by metabolism of CLA to an isomer of arachidonic acid...|$|R
