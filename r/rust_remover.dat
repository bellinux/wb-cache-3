30|$|Introduction: Rubigine® {{poisoning}} is {{a medical}} emergency that causes a major public health problem in underdeveloped countries, as it is frequently fatal. This poisoning is rare in France, but frequent in the French overseas departments (DOM). The Rubigine®, made of fluoride and used as a <b>rust</b> <b>remover,</b> is {{the main source of}} poisoning in the Caribbean. In Martinique, the exact incidence of this intoxication is unknown, as there is no national and regional register. It could represent up to 8 – 10 % of severe acute poisoning. It was not until April 1994 that, following a prefectural order on the declaration, classification, packaging and labeling of substances, the composition of Rubigine® was modified to significantly reduce the mortality induced by its ingestion. The objective of our study was to describe the clinical features and complications that can occur after ingestion of Rubigine® as well as to determine the prognostic factors of death.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{reinforced}} concrete structures are designed as per codes/standards but enough {{care is not}} always taken during construction process. As a result, the structures start showing signs of distress, some times less than 10 years of service life, requiring early repair and rehabilitation work. In this paper, {{a case study of}} 3 no. (G+ 8) multi-storeyed buildings badly damaged due to corrosion and Bhuj (India) earthquake of 2001, rehabilitated in 2003 has been presented. Repair strategy involved removal of delaminated carbonated concrete cover, application of <b>rust</b> <b>remover,</b> anti-corrosion coating, polymer bond coat, polymer modified mortar, injection of low viscosity epoxy grout to beam-column junctions and cracks, repair of masonry cracks with polymer modified mortar & grouting with SBR modified cement grout and jacketing of columns at the ground floor. Extensive material testing was carried out and specifications for acrylic and SBR polymer modified mortar were selected for durable repairs. Strict quality control and assurance both in material and workmanship was adopted. After nine years of successful rehabilitation and functioning, some signs of distress in the form of cracks and spalls due to rebar corrosion have been noted at some locations, requiring rehabilitation again. Some recommendations/conclusions have been given for durable concrete constructions and rehabilitation work...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} these {{guidelines}} is to ensure potentially hazardous waste is properly identified. They cover identifying and characterizing hazardous waste. They apply to workers and supervisors. 2 Guidelines All waste that is classified as hazardous – because of its properties, regulatory status, or both – must be managed and disposed of following stringent requirements. The following guidelines describe how to determine if waste is hazardous and how to characterize it. Note Characterizing hazardous waste can be a complex process. For help identifying and categorizing potentially hazardous waste, contact the Waste Management Group. 2. 1 Determining If the Material Is Waste Hazardous material becomes waste {{when it is not}} appropriate for further use. 2. 2 Determining If Waste Is Hazardous Waste is considered hazardous if it has hazardous characteristics or is classified as hazardous by federal or state regulations. 2. 2. 1 Hazardous Waste Properties A waste is considered hazardous if it has {{one or more of the}} following properties: Corrosivity. The ability to react dangerously with other waste, dissolve metal or other material, or burn the skin. Examples are waste from <b>rust</b> <b>remover,</b> acid or alkaline cleaning fluid, and battery acid. Ignitability. The ability to cause fires during transport, storage, or disposal. Examples are waste from paint, gasoline, diesel fuel, some degreasers, and some other solvents. Reactivity. The ability to become unstable or undergo a rapid or violent chemical reaction with water or other materials. Examples are waste from cyanide plating, bleach, and other oxidizers. Toxicity. The presence of toxic constituents above established regulatory levels. Examples are waste containing dissolved heavy metals, insecticides, and solvents...|$|E

40|$|Background Almost all {{reports of}} {{respiratory}} {{health effects of}} hydrofluoric acid are derived from industrial settings and usually involved massive and conspicuous exposures. In the present report we describe a case of adult-onset asthma immediately following use of a household <b>rust</b> stain <b>remover</b> that contained an 8 – 9 % aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid (HF). Methods This is a case-report. A literature search of hydrogen fluoride, and reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) was performed. Results A previously healthy 26 -year-old woman developed asthma immediately following inhalation exposure to hydrofluoric acid from a household cleaner, consistent with reactive airways dysfunction syndrome. The circumstances of exposure and possible mechanism of disease are discussed. Conclusions It is likely that this patient's use of the <b>rust</b> stain <b>remover</b> resulted in inhalation exposure to hydrofluoric acid well above any applicable standard, and hence constituted a ‘high level’ irritant exposure capable of inducing reactive airways dysfunction syndrome. In our opinion, {{the presence of this}} concentration hydrofluoric acid in a consumer product may be unduly hazardous. Am. J. Ind. Med. 44 : 321 – 324, 2003. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, In...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The polysaccharides are {{important}} materials in food, pharmaceutical, cosmetic and related bio-medical applications. Xanthan gum is a microbial polysaccharide of great commercial significance. It {{is well known}} as one of the best thickening polymers due to its high intrinsic stiffness related to the he-lical conformation stabilized in the presence of excess salt. It is used in a wide variety of foods for a number of important reasons, including emulsion stabilization, temperature stability, compatibility with food ingredients, and its pseudoplastic rheological properties. Due to its properties in thickening aque-ous solutions, as a dispersing agent, and stabilizer of emulsions and suspensions, xanthan gum is used in pharmaceutical formulations, cosmetics, and agricultural products, as well as in textile printing pastes, ceramic glazes, slurry explosive formulations, and <b>rust</b> <b>removers.</b> In this work the crosslinking of a mix-ture of xanthan and lignins in the presence of the epichlorohydrin, leading to superabsorbant hydrogels with high swelling rate in aqueous mediums, was studied. The swelling properties of these composite hy-drogels were investigated. Three different types of lignin have been used namely: aspen wood lignin (L), annual fiber crop lignin (GL) and lignin epoxy-modified resin (LER). Semi-interpenetrating polymer net-work hydrogels in various ratios were prepared. The influence of gravimetric ratio between components of the semi-interpenetrating polymer networks, as well as the kinetics of water sorption will be discussed. The maximum swelling degree of the hydrogels and the swelling rate constant were determined as a func-tion of the hydrogel’s composition. It has been established that the nature of lignin significantly influences swelling process, the chemical modified lignin having a particular behavior.

40|$|PURPOSE. Heme oxygenase (HO) is {{considered}} a fundamental endogenous immunomodulatory, cytoprotective, and anti-inflammatory system. This protective function is primarily ascribed to the inducible HO- 1. The authors examined the effect of HO- 1 induction on corneal inflammation and wound healing in mice undergoing epithelial injury. METHODS. C 57 BL 6 mice were treated with SnCl 2 the day before epithelial injury and once daily thereafter. The corneal epithelium was removed {{with the use of}} a corneal <b>rust</b> ring <b>remover</b> in anesthetized mice. Reepithelialization was measured by fluorescein staining. The inflammatory response was examined by histology and was quantified by the myeloperoxidase assay. Inflammatory lipid mediators were detected and quantified by LC/MS/MS-based lipidomic analysis.
