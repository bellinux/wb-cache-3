5|$|Despite {{the support}} of al-Husayni, <b>recruitment</b> of Muslims for the {{division}} fell well short of the numbers needed. Himmler then allowed a 10 percent Christian component, but the <b>recruitment</b> of sufficient Muslims continued to prove difficult, resulting in the induction of 2,800 Catholic Croats into the division. To Himmler's dismay, this was greater than the ratio of Catholics to Muslims that he had wanted.|$|E

(Significant <b>recruitment</b> of Murray cod in low-flow conditions in less regulated lowland rivers has now been proven.) This information also suggests that nonriver-regulation-related causes of degradation are playing a larger role in the survival and <b>recruitment</b> of Murray cod larvae than first thought; competition from extremely large numbers of invasive carp larvae are negatively affecting the survival and <b>recruitment</b> of Murray cod larvae to a much greater degree than first thought; and that decades of overfishing is playing a far larger role in the current state of Murray cod stocks, through depletion of spawning adults, than first thought.|$|E

Elliott took personal control over the <b>recruitment</b> process, selecting only those officers that he had known from his service in the Citizens Forces as his company commanders, who he in turn entrusted with choosing their own subordinates. <b>Recruitment</b> was conducted {{over a period of}} three weeks {{and by the end of}} the period the process had been so successful that the battalion was over establishment. Initially, the battalion was organised into eight companies, designated 'A' to 'H', while <b>recruitment</b> and initial training was undertaken at Broadmeadows, however, this was later reduced to the standard four companies, designated 'A' to 'D'.|$|E

In addition to all players returning from the 2007 team, #1 ranked high school player Maya Moore joined the team after a bitter <b>recruitment</b> battle between UConn and Tennessee. Shortly after Moore's commitment to UConn, Tennessee announced they were cancelling the annual series with UConn, thus ending {{one of the biggest}} rivalries in the sport. Even if both coaches remained vague and unspecific about the reasons of the cancellation, Tennessee filed a complaint to the NCAA about UConn's <b>recruitment</b> of Moore. UConn was found to have committed a secondary violation (involving a tour of the ESPN campus) and no punishment was handed out.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Julius Caesar in 54BC, regular legionary units were {{supplemented}} by exploratores, a body of scouts, and speculatores, spies who infiltrated enemy camps.

This irregular and extraordinary <b>recruitment</b> was not, however, typical of <b>recruitment</b> during this period, and Roman law still officially required that legions were recruited from Roman citizens only.|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{research}} has identified {{a variety of}} human capital dimensions related to the entrepreneur as positively influencing new venture performance. However, in high technology exploitation the entrepreneur is commonly only one person among other highly skilled individuals involved in the development. This longitudinal case study approach focuses on key <b>recruitments</b> contracted due to their earlier experiences needed in the ventures. Two perspectives are taken to approach how earlier experience is applied in new contexts; the drives behind the <b>recruitments,</b> and how new <b>recruitments</b> apply their earlier experiences. Timing, persistence, and transformation appear to be vital {{in the process of}} tranferring earlier experiences to new contexts. Timing is related to the early development of the venture, when all individuals are engaged in several different roles. An extension of timing is the challenge of persistance in matching earlier experiences with the entrepreneurial development. Finally, apart from transformation of the knowledge carried by individuals, they do also create their own platforms to work from.

5|$|However, many {{traits that}} appear to be simple adaptations are in fact exaptations: {{structures}} originally adapted for one function, but which coincidentally became somewhat useful for some other function in the process. One example is the African lizard Holaspis guentheri, which developed an extremely flat head for hiding in crevices, as can be seen by looking at its near relatives. However, in this species, the head has become so flattened that it assists in gliding from tree to treeâan exaptation. Within cells, molecular machines such as the bacterial flagella and protein sorting machinery evolved by the <b>recruitment</b> of several pre-existing proteins that previously had different functions. Another example is the <b>recruitment</b> of enzymes from glycolysis and xenobiotic metabolism to serve as structural proteins called crystallins within the lenses of organisms' eyes.|$|E
