This article uses MPOWER strategy as a framework to discuss information available from The Global Tobacco Surveillance System (GTSS) established in 1998. Data underline the need <b>for</b> <b>cardiologists</b> to 1) step up their efforts in promoting and providing cessation services in clinical settings; 2) become tobacco control advocates and support policy implementation in their countries; 3) raise patient and community awareness of harm caused by tobacco use and SHS exposure to health; 4) undertake policy relevant research where required; and 5) support national governments in effective implementation of provisions of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{vascular}} injuries {{associated with}} primary and revision {{total hip arthroplasty}} are infrequent, these complications can have devastating effects {{that can lead to}} morbidity and even mortality. A few previous reports have described embolic distal limb ischemia secondary to a failed and migrated acetabular implant in discontinuity with the pelvis. We present a rare case in which a support ring from a failed and migrated acetabular cage construct led to injury of the common femoral artery. The patient developed acute thrombotic occlusion leading to distal extremity ischemia even after oral anticoagulant therapy. The patient was treated with embolectomy with a Fogarty catheter, replacement of the injured common femoral artery with an InteRing 8 mm, and removal of the offending hardware. Recognition of the risks associated with failed and migrated components is important to prevent this complication <b>for</b> <b>cardiologists</b> as well as orthopedic surgeons. <Learning objective: Although vascular injuries associated with primary and revision total hip arthroplasty are infrequent, these complications can have devastating effects that can lead to morbidity and even mortality.

40|$|Objective—To {{assess whether}} a normal {{electrocardiogram}} can identify good left ventricular function and obviate the need <b>for</b> <b>routine</b> left ventriculography in patients undergoing cardiac catheterisation for suspected {{coronary artery disease}}.  Design—A prospective study of patients undergoing cardiac catheterisation.  Setting—A regional cardiac centre.  Patients—The electrocardiograms, coronary angiograms, and left ventriculograms of 391  consecutive patients undergoing investigations for suspected coronary artery disease were entered into the study. Patients with arrhythmias and cardiac pathologies other than coronary artery disease were excluded.  Main outcome measures—The electrocardiogram was assessed using a 29  point QRS scoring system, and classified by two cardiologists and a trainee cardiologist as normal or abnormal. Left ventricular function was assessed by digital ventriculography.  Results—The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of a QRS score of 0  (normal QRS complexes) for discriminating good left ventricular function (ejection fraction ⩾  50 %) were 92. 6 %, 41. 5 %, and 97. 2 %, respectively. The figures for a normal electrocardiogram as assessed by a doctor were 96. 3 %, 40. 4 %, and 98. 6 % <b>for</b> <b>cardiologist</b> A; 96. 3 %, 37. 4 %, and 98. 4 % <b>for</b> <b>cardiologist</b> B; and 94. 4 %, 49. 6 %, and 98. 2 % for the cardiology trainee.  Conclusions—If a cardiologist judges the ECG to be normal, left ventriculography is unnecessary and a formal QRS score does not improve reliability of this clinical judgment. Adopting this strategy would save £ 30 - 40   000 in consumables and 65 - 87 hours of catheter laboratory and staff time for a department catheterising 3000  patients with suspected coronary artery disease annually.    Keywords: cardiac catheterisation;  electrocardiogram;  left ventricular ejection fractio...|$|R
