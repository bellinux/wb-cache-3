The boats {{were built in the}} Philippines by an experienced boat builder to Wharram designs using modern strip plank with epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>glue</b> built over plywood frames. The catamarans had modern Dacron sails, Terylene stays and sheets with modern roller blocks. Wharram says he used Polynesian navigation to sail along the coast of Northern New Guinea and then sailed 150 miles to an island for which he had modern charts, proving {{that it is possible to}} sail a modern catamaran along the path of the Lapita Pacific migration. Unlike many other modern Polynesian [...] "replica" [...] voyages the Wharram catamarans were not towed or escorted by a modern vessel with modern GPS navigation system, nor were they fitted with a motor.|$|E

50|$|Following the war {{the firm}} {{became part of}} the {{government}} scheme to produce utility furniture bearing the CC41 mark and were central in providing cheaper manufacturing techniques to provide the country with lower cost furniture with which they could rebuild their homes, and in fact their design team invented and patented the technique of facing man-made boards with other woods.The Company also devised and perfected the means of assembling Furniture from preformed sections and completing the construction by curing <b>resin</b> <b>glue</b> lines, utilising 'Radio Frequency' electricity, or 'R.F.' There was no metal fixing required in the assembly at all.|$|E
50|$|In 1939, {{when the}} {{production}} had {{expanded to include}} floors and kitchens {{and the threat of}} World War II was causing a decline in the building industry, he considered alternatives and pioneered the development of new timber materials for the production of the Bruynzeel kitchen and for boat construction. Using a newly developed water-resistant synthetic <b>resin</b> <b>glue,</b> Bruynzeel developed a durable three-ply wood, similar to plywood, for the fabrication of external doors. Bruynzeel went on to extend the concept of the modular kitchen and with E.G. van de Stadt developed the first industrialised boat construction system in the world.|$|E
5000|$|Animal glue was {{the most}} common {{woodworking}} glue for thousands of years until the advent of synthetic glues such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and other <b>resin</b> <b>glues</b> in the 20th century. Today it is used primarily in specialty applications such as lutherie, pipe organ building, piano repairs, and antique restoration. Glass artists take advantage of hide glue's ability to bond with glass, applying hide glue to glass. As the glue hardens it shrinks, chipping the glass.|$|R
50|$|Immediately after World War II, {{the company}} {{expanded}} into synthetic <b>resin</b> <b>glues</b> and, in 1947, the first multipurpose consumer white glue, known as Elmer’s Glue-All, was introduced. The glue was packaged {{in a glass}} bottle with a popsicle stick type wooden applicator attached with a rubber band. Consumer feedback confirmed a need for an easier to use delivery method, which prompted the company to develop easy to squeeze bottles featuring a twistable orange cap, introduced in 1962. This innovation remains in use and is a trademark of Elmer's Products.|$|R
5000|$|In 1982 a Dutch inventor, Toon Coolen, {{patented}} {{a hockey}} {{stick with a}} [...] "hook" [...] head. The hockey stick manufacturers Grays took the design up in 1983 and the first mass-produced hockey sticks, with laminated timber head parts, were manufactured in Pakistan. This new design was possible because {{of the development of}} epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>glues</b> that did not require perfectly dry timber for bonding and curing to a strength that could cope with the immense stresses placed on a stick head when a hockey ball is struck with it.|$|R
50|$|These guitars were {{constructed}} using different woods (usually Nyatoh, for example, instead of Mahogany), were fastened with epoxies rather than wood-glues.

50|$|Wooden planks can be scarfed into a strake by {{suitably}} tapering {{the thickness}} of the adjoining ends. Traditionally, the adjoining faces were coated with mixed white lead and grease, then held together with copper rivets. It was important to not have the plank end as thin as a feather edge and to have the outboard thin edge at the after end of the joint. In later times, after adhesives had been developed by the aircraft industry, the joint might be made with <b>resin</b> <b>glue</b> and no rivets. In heavier carvel work, the joint would be a butt, riveted to a butt strap. Even large clinker vessels had scarfed strakes as in this form of construction; the strakes contribute a significant proportion of the structural strength of the boat as well as keeping it water-tight.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVarious natural organic film-making media {{from several}} {{chemical}} {{families have been}} used as varnishes. An improvement in the identification of these materials by the combination of Raman and infrared spectroscopies is here presented. Fourteen unaged reference samples representative of <b>resins,</b> <b>glues,</b> gums and oils were analyzed. FT-Raman and IR spectra were all compared in order to discriminate the different classes of organic media by considering their spectroscopic features. It led to a flowchart for material discrimination based on simple, notable and specific criteria. It appears that the different families (gums, <b>glues,</b> oils and <b>resins)</b> and subfamilies (di/triterpenoids resins) are easily differentiated thanks to their specific structural composition. However, discerning between compounds from a same subgroup, for example diterpenoid resins, could be ambiguous because the spectra depend on the sample aspect, age and degradations...|$|R
50|$|Many {{beautiful}} replicas {{are made}} of animalier sculpture, which may be cast or molded in any size and of any material. The most desirable of these are exact in detail and made from the same material, such as cast iron, spelter, or cast bronze, as used in the artist's original sculpture. Most of the original animalier sculptors used the traditional lost wax process of casting prevalent at the time. Alexandre Guionnet was exceptional in that he worked in wood. Modern reproductions of the original sculptures frequently use patinated verdigris cast bronze or iron, or bonded marble resin (pulverized reconstituted marble combined with <b>resin</b> <b>glue),</b> as well as various other materials and techniques, such as a composite of Capiz placuna placenta oyster shells, also known as window oyster shells, which come primarily from the Philippines (where they are known as kapiz).|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{the term}} MDF {{has become a}} generic name for any dry process fibre board. MDF is {{typically}} made up of 82% wood fibre, 9% urea-formaldehyde <b>resin</b> <b>glue,</b> 8% water and 1% paraffin wax. and the density is typically between 500 kg/m3 (31 lb/ft3) and 1,000 kg/m3 (62 lb/ft3). The range of density and classification as light, standard, or high density board is a misnomer and confusing. The density of the board, when evaluated {{in relation to the}} density of the fibre that goes into making the panel, is important. A thick MDF panel at a density of 700-720 kg/m3 may be considered as high density in the case of softwood fibre panels, whereas a panel of the same density made of hard wood fibres is not regarded as so. The evolution of the various types of MDF has been driven by differing need for specific applications.|$|E

He had stopped in Kansas City, to visit his two sons, Bill and Knute Jr., who were in boarding school there at the Pembroke-Country Day School. A little over an hour after taking off from Kansas City, one of the Fokker Trimotor's wings broke up in flight. The cause of the break up was determined to be the fact that the plywood outer skin of the plane was bonded to the ribs and spars with aliphatic <b>resin</b> <b>glue</b> that was water based, and flight in rain had deteriorated the bond to the point that sections of the plywood suddenly separated inflight. The plane crashed into a wheat field near Bazaar, Kansas, killing Rockne and seven others.|$|E

5000|$|Additional sizing agents, {{including}} <b>resins,</b> <b>glue,</b> or starch, can {{be added}} to the web to alter its characteristics. Sizing improves the paper's water resistance, decreases its ability to fuzz, reduces abrasiveness, and improves its printing properties and surface bond strength. These may be applied at the wet (internal sizing) or on the dry end (surface sizing), or both. At the dry end sizing is usually applied with a size press. The size press may be a roll applicator (flooded nip) or Nozzle applicator [...] It is usually placed before the last dryer section. Some paper machines also make use of a 'coater' to apply a coating of fillers such as calcium carbonate or china clay usually suspended in a binder of cooked starch and styrene-butadiene latex. Coating produces a very smooth, bright surface with the highest printing qualities.|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} {{formaldehyde}} exposure in homes is long-standing {{and has been}} studied over time. Formaldehyde is frequently used in plywood, fiberboard, <b>resins,</b> <b>glues,</b> and several other construction components. In the past, formaldehyde was also used in insulation of many homes. In March of 1982, the U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) called for a ban on urea foam formaldehyde insulation (UFFI). (US Consumer Product Safety Commission, March 1982, Release # 82 - 005) While this ban was challenged by several commercial groups citing that formaldehyde exposure was greater from carpets and other building materials, UFFI use had dropped precipitously by the mid 1980 ’s. However, homes built before or {{around the time of}} the ban of UFFI still had this insulation in their homes. Changes in formaldehyde use in home construction The 1982 ban on UFFI is one factor contributing to decreased levels of formaldehyd...|$|R
50|$|This is a normal, usually wooden oar {{to which}} weight {{has been added}} at the inboard end so that the blade end is noticeably lighter and easier for a rower to operate without fatigue. The two methods of adding weight are to either have a much larger section in the oar {{immediately}} next to the handle for {{a distance of about}} 450 mm or to drill an 18 mm hole inside the handle for a distance of about 150 mm and add about 12 oz of lead secured by epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>glue.</b> For a 7 ft oar the balance point is about 12 inches outboard of the rowlock. Often surplus wood is removed from the blade's width and thickness and at the neck between the blade and the shaft to further reduce outboard weight. This type of oar is much better for long-range rowing.|$|E

5000|$|Resorcinol-formaldehyde <b>resin</b> <b>glue</b> is {{very strong}} and durable (resisting {{immersion}} in boiling water, mild acids, salt water, solvents, mold, fungus, ultraviolet, etc.). It must be mixed before use (liquid resin and powdered catalyst). It has a dark purple color which may be objectionable in some uses. Toxic. For many years, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has stated that [...] "Resorcinol is the only known adhesive recommended and approved for use in wooden aircraft structure and fully meets necessary strength and durability requirements" [...] for certificated aircraft, however in fact {{the vast majority of}} wooden aircraft built in recent decades (mostly amateur-built aircraft) instead use other types of adhesives (primarily epoxy resin systems) which offer greater strength and even more importantly, much less criticality in perfect application technique. Most newer adhesives are much more tolerant to typical construction mistakes (such as small gaps or misalignments between parts) than resorcinol, which offers virtually no tolerance for such everyday construction situations. This can pose major difficulties, especially in complex assemblies. However, resorcinol is still used by some builders/restorers, and is commonly seen in vintage aircraft.|$|E

500|$|Industry can use {{oil shale}} as a fuel for thermal power-plants, burning it (like coal) to drive steam turbines; {{some of these}} plants employ the {{resulting}} heat for district heating of homes and businesses.

5000|$|Plywood {{offers the}} builder a better [...] "plank", far wider, thinner, and {{stronger}} than a simple wood plank. Ply is normally produced in 4' × 8' (1.2 m × 2.4 m) sheets or similar. It is normally joined lengthwise by an 1:8 scarf joint using epoxy <b>resin</b> <b>glue.</b> A chined hull built out of plywood will often be designed to keep most of the lengthwise joints between the plywood sheets at the chines, thus making the building process easier. While chine logs (often just called chines) {{can be used for}} plywood boats, another common technique replaces the chine logs with a fiberglass and epoxy fillet joint that provides both connection and stiffness to the joint; this method is most commonly called stitch and glue construction. The result of the stitch and glue operation is a composite [...] "chine log" [...] with a much greater degree of flexibility in curvature and shape than is possible with a wooden chine log. Thinner ply panels, especially 4 mm, can be warped into compound bends to achieve arc bottom boats. This has the benefit of giving a more rounded section, with more displacement and in theory slightly higher speed. Additionally the bent ply is far stiffer than a flat ply panel, so needs less internal support, in the hull, in the form of frames or stringers. This further reduces weight giving a significant boost in performance and by clever design can be used to create a shape closer in appearance to a rounded hull but at far less cost.|$|E

In these workshops, all the most exposed workers to wood dust were surveyed at the areas of sanding, brushing, immunization and painting (workers with the highest risk to get chronic respiratory disease). They were 177 workers. The use of hard and soft woods for furniture was detected. Besides, some pesticides, volatile organic solvents, synthetic epoxy <b>resins</b> <b>glues</b> and paintings, were used for finishes, which increases the risk of acquiring some neurological diseases and damage to the nervous system. Occurrence of cancer in nostrils mainly due to the use of hardwoods is an additional risk. With regard to the basic lighting conditions, it was found that half of workshops had deficiencies in special carving areas, because they were below the minimum allowable lighting limit level (500 lux).
