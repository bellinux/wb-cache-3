40|$|International audienceAirborne {{laser scanner}} {{technique}} is broadly {{the most appropriate}} way to acquire rapidly and with high density 3 D data over a city. Once the 3 D lidar data are available, the next task is the automatic data processing, with major aim to construct 3 D building models. Among the numerous automatic reconstruction methods, the techniques allowing the detection of 3 D building <b>roof</b> <b>planes</b> are of crucial importance. For this purpose, this paper studies the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Its principle and pseudocode - seldom detailed in the related literature - {{as well as its}} complete analyse are presented in this paper. Despite all advantages of this algorithm, it gives sometimes erroneous results. That {{can be explained by the}} fact that it uses a pure mathematical principle for detecting the <b>roof</b> <b>planes.</b> So it looks for the best plane without taking into account the particularity of the captured object. The extended RANSAC algorithm proposed in this paper allows harmonizing the mathematical aspect of the algorithm with the geometry of a roof. It is shown that the extended approach provides very satisfying results, even in the case of very weak point density and for different levels of building complexity. Moreover, the adjacency relationships of the neighbouring <b>roof</b> <b>planes</b> are described and analysed. Hence the <b>roof</b> <b>planes</b> are successfully detected and adjacency relationships of the adjacent <b>roof</b> <b>planes</b> are calculate. Finally the automatic building modelling can be carried out easily...|$|R

Starting with segmented <b>roof</b> <b>planes</b> from building LiDAR points, a BSP (binary space partitioning) algorithm {{is used to}} partition the bounding box of the building into volumetric cells, whose geometric features and their topology are simultaneously determined. To resolve the inside/outside labelling problem of cells, a global energy function considering surface visibility and spatial regularization between adjacent cells is constructed and minimized via graph cuts. As a result, the cells are labelled as either inside or outside, where the planar surfaces between the inside and outside form the reconstructed building model. Two LiDAR data sets of Yangjiang (China) and Wuhan University (China) {{are used in the}} study. Experimental results show that the completeness of reconstructed <b>roof</b> <b>planes</b> is 87. 5 %. Comparing with existing data-driven approaches, the proposed approach is global. Roof faces and edges as well as their topology can be determined at one time via minimization of an energy function.

40|$|Automated {{reconstruction}} of buildings from different data sources {{has been one}} of the most challenging problems in photogrammetry and computer vision. Systems for automated building reconstruction fail in many cases due to complexities involved in the data including image noise, occlusion, shadow, and low contrast, as well as, low accuracy or density of height data. In this paper, the problem of overgrown and undergrown regions in the segmentation of aerial images is discussed, and a split-and-merge technique is presented to overcome this problem by making use of height data. This technique is based on splitting image regions whose associated height points do not fall in a single plane, and merging coplanar neighboring regions. A robust plane-fitting method is used to fit planar surfaces to height points that are highly contaminated by gross errors. Final <b>roof</b> <b>planes</b> are extracted out of the image planar regions by checking their slope and height over a morphologically opened DSM. An experimental evaluation is conducted, and its results indicate the capability of the proposed technique in splitting overgrown regions, merging undergrown coplanar regions, and selecting the final <b>roof</b> <b>planes.</b> Also, the method is shown to be computationally efficient, and the reconstructed <b>roof</b> <b>planes</b> are of acceptable accuracy.

5000|$|The {{pavilion}} {{was to be}} bare, with no exhibits, {{leaving only}} the structure accompanying a single sculpture and specially-designed furniture (the Barcelona Chair). This lack of accommodation enabled Mies to treat the Pavilion as a continuous space; blurring inside and outside. [...] "The design was predicated on an absolute distinction between structure and enclosure—a regular grid of cruciform steel columns interspersed by freely spaced planes". However, the structure {{was more of a}} hybrid style, some of these planes also acted as supports. The floor plan is very simple. The entire building rests on a plinth of travertine. A southern U-shaped enclosure, also of travertine, helps form a service annex and a large water basin. The floor slabs of the pavilion project out and over the pool—once again connecting inside and out. Another U-shaped wall {{on the opposite side of}} the site also forms a smaller water basin. This is where the statue by Georg Kolbe sits. The roof plates, relatively small, are supported by the chrome-clad, cruciform columns. This gives the impression of a hovering roof. Robin Evans said that the reflective columns appear to be struggling to hold the [...] "floating" [...] <b>roof</b> <b>plane</b> down, not to be bearing its weight.|$|E
50|$|Much of Mies’ syntactical {{development}} {{throughout the}} three building progression {{leading up to}} the Neue Nationalgalerie was prefigured in an earlier project for a Museum for a Small City. This project was published in a special May 1943 edition of Architectural Forum. In his publication, Mies describes a seemingly floating <b>roof</b> <b>plane,</b> suspended above a single clear-span space punctuated by equidistant columns. This project is now seen as a significant move on Mies’ part toward the alleviation of interior space by both defining and minimizing structural enclosure, thus joining exterior and interior space in a meaningful way. The structure itself, a composite of little more than ground plane, support and roof, thus becomes the building. The aesthetic importance of the clear-span was directly related to Mies’ conception of museum space in general, a “defining, rather than confining space.” The completely open nature of the plan also serves to eliminate the barrier between art and community, simultaneously breaking down the reverence enacted by severely partitioned spaces and inviting interaction between viewer and art. The overall aesthetic affect is thus one of vitalizing liberation. This infinitely transformative capability and universality is also seen in Mies’ buildings from the interveneing years, namely the Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois, and Crown Hall of the Illinois Institute of Technology campus. Various commentators have recognized the structure’s ties to classical building, seeing it as a modern temple whose monumental simplicity evinces the immense skill behind its design and conception.|$|E
5000|$|The church {{building}} is basically rectangular in shape, and measures 63 by 33 ft. [...] It was designed in {{a combination of}} the Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival styles. The Gothic is found in the polychrome finish of the brick and stone, the pointed arch windows and doors, the wall buttresses, the battlements on top the corner tower, and the steeply pitched roof with steep cross gables. The Romanesque is found in the short bell tower, the broad <b>roof</b> <b>plane,</b> the rusticated stone on the foundation, the entryway, and the quoins on the corners. The main facade on the west side is dominated by a large stained glass window that is flanked by two smaller windows. In the gable peak is a trefoil window below a large stone cross. A small narthex is located at the main entryway in the tower. The sandstone pillars of the portico are connected by a sandstone arch. Wrought iron grill work is located in the arch. Trefoils are cut into the sandstone railings. Medium-sized windows dominate both side elevations. The small extension on the north elevation was designed to house a pipe organ that was never installed. The sacristy was in the extension on the south elevation.

40|$|Using {{airborne}} {{laser scanner}} data, buildings {{can be detected}} automatically, and their roof shapes can be reconstructed. The success rate of building detection {{and the level of}} detail of the resulting building models depend on the resolution of the laser scanner data, which is still lower than the resolution of aerial imagery. Building extraction from aerial images alone is difficult because of problems related to shadows, occlusions, and poor contrast. That is why it makes sense to combine these data sources to improve the results of building extraction. This article deals with the fusion of airborne laser scanner data and multi-spectral aerial images for building extraction. There are three instances in the overall process when exploiting the complementary properties of these data appears to be most beneficial: building detection, <b>roof</b> <b>plane</b> detection, and the determination of roof boundaries. Building detection is based on the Dempster-Shafer theory for data fusion. In <b>roof</b> <b>plane</b> detection, the results of a segmentation of the laser scanner data are improved using the digital images.

This paper focuses on a new method for fully automated solar potential assessment of roof planes from airborne LiDAR data and uses the full 3 D information for both, <b>roof</b> <b>plane</b> detection and solar potential analysis. An image based candidate region detection algorithm reduces the data volume of the point cloud and identifies potential areas containing buildings with high completeness (97 %). Three dimensional roof planes are extracted from the building candidate regions and their aspect and slope are calculated. The horizon of each <b>roof</b> <b>plane</b> is calculated within the 3 D point cloud and thus shadowing effects of nearby objects such as vegetation, roofs, chimneys, dormers etc. are respected in a proper way. In contrast to other objects such as walls or buildings vegetation is characterized by transparent properties. Thus, in a further step vegetation is detected within the remaining non-roof points and transparent shadow values are introduced by calculating a local transparency measure averaged per tree segment. The following solar potential analysis is performed for regularly distributed roof points and results in both, (i) the annual sum of the direct and diffuse radiation for each <b>roof</b> <b>plane</b> and (ii) in a detailed information about the distribution of radiation within one roof. By calculating a clear sky index, cloud cover effects are considered using data from a nearby meteorological ground station. ...|$|E

Building roofs are preferable locations for photovoltaics considering shadowing effects but minimum size, exposition and slope of the <b>roof</b> <b>planes</b> {{have to be taken}} into account. To obtain such detailed information, laserscanning data combined with digital topographic data (building contour lines) are analysed. For extraction of <b>roof</b> <b>planes</b> an algorithm developed as part of a 3 D building modelling system was applied. As result a mathematical description of each plane is obtained which is used to determine the required features size, exposition and slope. By means of digital contour polygons the planes and their parameters are assigned to individual buildings. The selection of favourable buildings for location of photovoltaic installations is performed by a GIS database management system. For testing purposes this method was applied to an urban area of about 4 km x 2 km with complex roof structures, building blocks etc. to prove the capabilities as well as the limitations of this approach. Problems occur at some <b>roof</b> <b>planes</b> where laser point density is lower than in other parts. In these cases more than one plane may be extracted due to significant undulations inside the point cloud. Additionally not all disturbing objects (e. g. dormers, chimneys, antennas etc.) were excluded totally (as it is necessary for photovoltaic areas). Therefore, supplementary information like aerial images should be integrated in this analysis in the future to detect and delineate the areas more precisely, which are effectively available for the application of photovoltaics. 1...|$|R
