5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement {{was created by}} zooming in on <b>Reeve</b> while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, <b>Reeve</b> and actors were put {{in a variety of}} rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also {{led to the creation of}} the Zoptic system.|$|E

5|$|The four Christopher <b>Reeve</b> {{films were}} again {{released}} on November 28, 2006, in new DVD releases {{to coincide with}} Superman Returns, also released in that year. Superman was released in a four-disc 'special edition' similar to Superman II, which was released in a two-disc special edition. Both Superman III and IV were released in single disc 'deluxe editions', and all four releases were available together in The Christopher <b>Reeve</b> Superman Collection, an 8-disc set that was valued at US$79.92.

5|$|Upon {{gaining the}} {{rights for the}} film Superman, Alexander Salkind and his son, Ilya Salkind, also {{purchased}} {{the rights to the}} character of Superman's cousin Supergirl. Supergirl was released in 1984 as a spin-off of the <b>Reeve</b> films; <b>Reeve</b> was slated to have a cameo but he ultimately backed out of the production. It stars Helen Slater in her first motion picture in the title role, while Faye Dunaway (who received top billing) played the primary villain, Selena; the film also featured Marc McClure reprising his role as Jimmy Olsen. Even though the film performed poorly at the box office, Helen Slater was nominated for a Saturn Award.|$|E

50|$|<b>Reeves</b> Teletape Studios was a {{group of}} {{television}} studios located in Manhattan in New York City.

5|$|For {{landings}} and take-offs, wire flying riggings were devised and used. On location, {{these were}} suspended from tower cranes, {{whereas in the}} studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious considering computer-controlled rigs were not then available—the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard for example. Although stuntmen were used, <b>Reeve</b> did {{much of the work}} himself, and was suspended as high as 50feet in the air. Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend <b>Reeve</b> were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, the wires were more or less imperceptible).|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Scarborough was {{incorporated}} as a borough. The <b>reeve</b> {{was replaced with}} a mayor. Albert Campbell, who had been <b>reeve</b> since 1957, became Scarborough's first mayor. The new borough's council consisted of the mayor and {{four members of the}} board of control (which functioned as an executive committee). There were also ten aldermen. The mayor and the controllers also sat on Metro Council. In 1973, Scarborough increased in size when the West Rouge area, formerly within the Township of Pickering, was transferred to it with the creation of the Regional Municipality of Durham. The borough's status was changed to city in 1983. The number of aldermen was increased to 14 and the term of office extended to three years from two.|$|E

5000|$|Popular {{speculation}} that <b>Reeves</b> was {{an inspiration for}} the fictional Lone Ranger may have originated from the 2006 <b>Reeves</b> biography.

5|$|The Kentish royal legend, {{probably}} 11th-century, {{contains the}} story of a villainous <b>reeve</b> of Ecgberht of Kent called Thunor, who is swallowed up by the earth at a place from then on known as þunores hlæwe (Old English 'Thunor's mound'). Gabriel Turville-Petre saw this as an invented origin for the placename demonstrating loss of memory that Thunor had been a god's name.|$|E

5|$|Alarmed by {{the raid}} on Genoa, the {{authorities}} in Leghorn ordered Impérieuse to leave immediately. The frigate sailed north and took shelter at Fezzano, near the port of La Spezia. The French had decided that since capture was inevitable, the frigate should be destroyed, and beached the ship in order to remove guns and stores. Six days after the capture of Modeste, Captain reached La Spezia, acting on reports that Impérieuse was in the bay. <b>Reeve</b> discovered the French ship under the guns of the Santa Maria shore battery, and the following morning, 12 October, used his ship's boats to tow Captain alongside Impérieuse. At 08:00 boat parties from the ship of the line boarded the frigate, discovering that the remaining French crew had abandoned their disarmed ship during the night and scuttled it in shallow water. The British {{were able to take}} possession of Impérieuse without opposition from the battery. <b>Reeve</b> instructed his carpenters to make the frigate seaworthy again, refloating the ship and completing temporary repairs on 13 October before sailing back to Toulon with his prize.|$|E

5|$|Cannon Films {{picked up}} an option for a fourth Superman/Reeve film, with <b>Reeve</b> reprising the role due to his {{interest}} in the film's topic regarding nuclear weapons. However, Cannon decided to cut the budget of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace from $35 million to $15 million, with poor special effects and heavy re-editing, which contributed to the film's poor reception. Warner Bros. decided to give the series a break following the negative reception of the last two Superman films.|$|E
5|$|Christopher <b>Reeve</b> {{was cast}} as Superman, having {{initially}} failed {{to impress the}} Salkinds before bulking up. Brando meanwhile, despite spending {{less than two weeks}} on the shoot, and not even reading the script until then, earned $3.7million up front, plus 11.75% of the gross profits from the film. The film was a success both critically and commercially, being released during the Christmas season of 1978; it did not have much competition, leading the producers to believe that this was one factor in the film's success.|$|E
5|$|In 1011 the Danes again raided England, {{and from}} 8–29 September they laid siege to Canterbury.

Godwine (Bishop of Rochester), Leofrun (abbess of St Mildrith's), and the king's <b>reeve,</b> Ælfweard were captured also, but the abbot of St Augustine's Abbey, Ælfmær, managed to escape.
