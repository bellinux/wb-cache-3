50|$|Designed by {{architect}} Akira Kuryu, {{the memorial}} was constructed between November 2000 and December 2002. The subterranean {{interior of the}} building contains a reference area, a large conference room, an anteroom with a bank of monitors showing photographs of the victims, and a stylized <b>remembrance</b> <b>hall</b> in which 12 pillars of light symbolize hope for peace. An upper level serves as an abbreviated tour, with diary excerpts and a viewing station allowing visitors to view the <b>Remembrance</b> <b>Hall</b> from above. As viewed from the outside, {{the top of the}} memorial consists mainly of a tree-lined basin of water through which the 12 pillars of light continue to rise from below. At night, 70,000 fiber optic lights are illuminated {{across the surface of the}} water, symbolizing the victims.|$|E

The building is set to be rebuilt and according to National Museums of Kenya, it is a historical building that should resemble the previous one and built using red bricks. On the other hand, Steve Oundo, the chairman of Architectural Association of Kenya prefers a <b>remembrance</b> <b>hall</b> on the site, instead of rebuilding the supermarket.|$|E

25|$|However, 2009 {{brought with}} it a change of venue for Remembrance Sunday ceremonies. The reason given for the change was the ongoing roadwork near the Cross of Sacrifice. On Remembrance Sunday, 8 November 2009, the annual {{ceremony}} and parade were held at the Gibraltar War Memorial, {{also known as the}} British War Memorial. Poppy wreaths were placed on a temporary frame {{at the base of the}} monument on Line Wall Road, near Gibraltar City <b>Hall.</b> <b>Remembrance</b> Sunday ceremonies were also held at the Gibraltar War Memorial the following two years, on 14 November 2010 and 13 November 2011. Future Remembrance Sundays will fall on 11 November 2012, 10 November 2013, 9 November 2014, and 8 November 2015.|$|R
