Relay {{is connected with}} telephone circuit and permits adjustable message time between 30 and 55 seconds. After that time interval, relay opens, making line free for another paging regardless of what previous caller did with his telephone...|$|E
40|$|Memory {{disorders}} {{cause problems}} {{to the individual}} concerned, place a significant informal care burden upon families and friends, and have resource implications for the NHS and the wider public sector. Strategies to help mitigate these problems include mnemonics, environmental adaptations and external aids. It is often difficult, however, for memory impaired people to use such aids. To address these difficulties, a <b>radio-paging</b> <b>system</b> called NeuroPage® has been developed. Recently a clinical trial of effectiveness of NeuroPage® was conducted. This paper describes the economic evaluation component of that study, considering {{the costs of the}} NeuroPage® and tentative estimates of its efficiency, as judged by a cost-benefit analysis from the viewpoint of the NHS and Social Services. The cost of the NeuroPage® itself was £ 50 per patient. There {{was no significant difference in}} other NHS and Social Service costs between NeuroPage® and no-NeuroPage® phases of the trial. The willingness to pay varied between £ 74 for the mean WTP and £ 45 for the median. Thus, based on the median WTP figure the NeuroPage® results in a loss to society of £ 5 per month, and if based on the mean results in a net gain of £ 24. Although the result is equivocal, it is important to bear in mind that the NeuroPage® is a new, innovative, instrument to assist those experiencing memory impairment in leading an independent life. To our knowledge, this study represents the first economic evaluation of such a technology. Due to this, there are several caveats to face in interpreting the results and several lessons learnt for future analysis of such new technologies...|$|E
40|$|In September 1974 {{the colleges}} of {{pharmacy}} and medicine of the University of Saskatchewan began offering a drug information {{service to the}} pharmacists and physicians of Saskatchewan without charge. With {{the help of a}} <b>radio-page</b> <b>system,</b> calls are taken immediately by experienced pharmacists and pharmacologists. The cost of long-distance phone calls is borne by grants from the Saskatchewan medical and pharmaceutical associations. During the 1 st year of operation 415 requests for information were received. Of 93 persons who called up to Feb. 28, 1975, 76 % responded to an evaluation questionnaire; virtually all described the service as very valuable. The information received resulted in the alteration of drug therapy in one third of calls requesting information to assist in current treatment of a patient...|$|R
