50|$|<b>Ripple</b> <b>control</b> is {{the most}} common form of load control, and is used in many {{countries}} around the world, including Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands, and South Africa. <b>Ripple</b> <b>control</b> involves superimposing a higher-frequency signal (usually between 100 and 1600 Hz) onto the standard 50-60 Hz of the main power signal. When receiver devices attached to non-essential residential or industrial loads receive this signal, they shut down the load until the signal is disabled or another frequency signal is received.|$|E

50|$|Load {{management}}, {{also known}} as demand side management (DSM), {{is the process of}} balancing the supply of electricity on the network with the electrical load by adjusting or controlling the load rather than the power station output. This can be achieved by direct intervention of the utility in real time, by the use of frequency sensitive relays triggering the circuit breakers (<b>ripple</b> <b>control),</b> by time clocks, or by using special tariffs to influence consumer behavior. Load management allows utilities to reduce demand for electricity during peak usage times (peak shaving), which can, in turn, reduce costs by eliminating the need for peaking power plants. In addition, some peaking power plants can take more than an hour to bring on-line which makes load management even more critical should a plant go off-line unexpectedly for example. Load management can also help reduce harmful emissions, since peaking plants or backup generators are often dirtier and less efficient than base load power plants. New load-management technologies are constantly under development — both by private industry and public entities.|$|E

40|$|Using first-principles calculations, the {{dependence}} in {{the properties of}} the monovacancy of graphene under <b>rippling</b> <b>controlled</b> by an isotropic strain was determined, with a particular focus on spin moments. At zero strain, the vacancy shows a spin moment of 1. 5 μ B that increases to ∼ 2 μ B when the graphene is in tension. The changes are more dramatic under compression in that the vacancy becomes nonmagnetic when graphene is compressed more than 2 %. This transition is linked to the structural changes that occur around vacancies and is associated with formation of ripples. For compressions slightly greater than 3 %, this rippling leads to formation of a heavily reconstructed vacancy structure consisting of two deformed hexagons and pentagons. Our results suggest that any magnetism induced by vacancies that occurs in graphene can be controlled by applying strain. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the space environment is being polluted by power line harmonic radiation (PLHR), generated from harmonics of the electrical power transmission frequency (50 or 60 Hz) and radiated into the ionosphere and magnetosphere by long power lines. While some in-situ satellite measurements of PLHR have been reported, it has proved difficult to confirm the source and overall significance. The electricity network of the city of Dunedin, New Zealand, is tiny compared to the many large industrial zones found outside New Zealand. However, the 1050 Hz <b>ripple</b> <b>control</b> signal injected into the local electrical grid at regular intervals as a load-control mechanism provides an opportunity for identifying PLHR strengths radiated from a spatially well defined electrical network. In-situ observations by satellites should allow a greater understanding of PLHR and its significance as man-made pollution to near-Earth space. Calculations have been undertaken to estimate the strength of the radiation fields expected from the <b>ripple</b> <b>control</b> signal which is injected into the Dunedin city electrical network. We find that ground-based measurements will not be sensitive enough for detection of the <b>ripple</b> <b>control</b> radiation fields, even during the quietest winter night. While significant power penetrates the lower ionosphere, this is well below the reported threshold required for nonlinear triggering in the Van Allen radiation belts. Some radiated fields at satellite altitudes should be detectable, allowing in-situ measurements. At the altitude of the DEMETER mission, the radiated electric fields will not be detectable under any ionospheric conditions. However, we find that the radiated magnetic fields may be detectable by the DEMETER satellite at certain times, although this will be very difficult. Nonetheless, there is the possibility for future experimental campaigns. Keywords. Magnetospheric physics (Magnetosphereionosphere interactions; Plasma waves and instabilities) ?

40|$|The {{classical}} {{design of}} an active power factor corrector (PFC) leads to slow transient response because the compensator used in this circuit is designed with narrow bandwidth. In this paper, the transient response of the PFC can be substantially improved by making the bandwidth of this compensator is relatively wide.

Because of the voltage ripple at the output of the compensator which is considered the control signal, both the static and the dynamic behaviors of the PFC change in comparison with no voltage <b>ripple</b> on the <b>control</b> signal. The static behavior of a PFC with appreciable voltage ripple in the output voltage loop is analysed in this paper by using two parameters: Amplitude of the relative voltage <b>ripple</b> on the <b>control</b> signal and its phase lag angle.
