They wear a uniform and work {{together}} in patrols of four to ten boys with an elected patrol leader. Scouts share responsibilities, apply skills learned at meetings and live together in the outdoors. The advancement system provides opportunities for personal growth and self-reliance. Scouts interact with adult leaders who act as <b>role</b> <b>models</b> <b>and</b> mentors, but they are expected to plan their own activities within the troop and to participate in community service. Opportunities are provided for leadership training with practical application.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Roman {{education}} was moral and practical. Stories about great men and women, or cautionary tales about individual failures, {{were meant to}} instil Roman values (mores maiorum). Parents and family members were expected to act as <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> <b>and</b> parents who worked for a living passed their skills on to their children, who might also enter apprenticeships for more advanced training in crafts or trades. Formal {{education was}} available only to children from families who could pay for it, {{and the lack of}} state intervention in access to education contributed to the low rate of literacy.|$|E
5|$|While not portraying Akira sympathetically, {{the film}} does offer a socio-political {{view on the}} origins and inevitability of such {{criminal}} types in society. The tenements in which the youths reside are depicted as inhospitable and sterile. Lacking education, proper <b>role</b> <b>models</b> <b>and</b> moral codes, critic Bryan Hartzheim posited, crime and base pleasures are their most open recourse. They seem aware of the injustices in their environments and rail against society at large. However, Akira is illustrated as being capable of innocent pleasure, particularly in one fleeting scene in which he and his black friend Gil (Chico Rolands), whom he views as a fellow outcast, frolic in the ocean.|$|E

Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is one of the club's most prominent supporters. Since the emergence of the Boulogne Boys in the 1980s, PSG fan groups or ultras have been linked to football hooliganism. PSG's Boulogne Boys, considered one of the oldest hooligan groups in France, took their British neighbours as dubious <b>role</b> <b>models</b> <b>and</b> violence escalated in the early 1990s. PSG owners Canal+, France's premium pay channel, even tried to break up the Boys without success.|$|E
25|$|Although {{popular with}} many, the {{character}} has also garnered much criticism over the years. In November 2005 the character was blamed for turning children into playground bullies by Dr. Sally Henry, {{who claimed that}} impressionable children look to male soap characters as <b>role</b> <b>models</b> <b>and</b> subsequently copy their violent behaviour. Indeed, the character's violent behaviour evoked concern from viewers in October 2002. A scene in which Phil beat his godson Jamie was criticised for being too realistic by TV watchdogs. The Broadcasting Standards Commission upheld 31 complaints from viewers, saying that the scenes were too strong for a programme shown before the 9pm watershed.|$|E

25|$|The Friend of Singa Award was {{the brain}} child of Vincent Lam, {{a member of}} the Singapore Courtesy Council in 1991 as a means to {{recognise}} courteous conduct by students, and to function symbiotically with the school's efforts to teach courteous behaviour within students as well. It was established with the hope that other students would see winners of the Friend of Singa Award as <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> <b>and</b> follow the example set by them as well. The award, opened to any school in Singapore, involved the nomination of a student from each school by recounting the respective student's act of kindness and courtesy. Among all the nominations, a student would then be chosen for the Most Courteous Student Award and 10 other students for Merit Awards.|$|E
25|$|In theater, {{there are}} quite a few plays and musicals that have lesbian {{characters}} or focus on lesbian themes. One particular musical that has received a lot of recognition in the past few years is Fun Home. Based on the graphic novel of the same name, Fun Home is a personal account of Alison Bechdel's self-discovery as a lesbian. The show also features themes of the decision to come out, having sex for the first time, and coming to terms with one's sexuality. Many of the songs in the show focus on these themes, such as the moment of recognition one knows they are gay, when they find gay <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> <b>and</b> the awkwardness and authenticity that comes with first time sex. This show stands out because it normalizes the lesbian experience and speaks of lesbian sex without the fetishation found in much other media platforms.|$|E

25|$|On Saturday 19 November 2011, Youth Challenge International (YCI), in {{partnership}} with local and international organizations celebrated International Men's Day {{for the first time}} in Arusha and Morogoro, Tanzania. In Arusha, YCI, The Umoja Centre, Support for International Change, UMATI, Initiative for Youth Organization and Global Service Corps hosted the event at the Mbauda Open Market Ground. This event was aimed to promote men and boys as positive <b>role</b> <b>models</b> <b>and</b> to educate the community on the role of males and females in health, education, family life, violence and life choices. The event included performances, games, and educational activities. Over 500 youth and other community members came together to acknowledge the roles and responsibilities of men and boys in creating a brighter future for all Tanzanians. To celebrate the event in Morogoro, volunteers, along with partner organization Faraja Trust Fund, held a soccer tournament on with 8 local teams. To qualify to participate in the tournament each team had to come to two information sessions on male sexual and reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, gender roles and good governance. YCI and Faraja provided an on-site HIV testing centre, a DJ with music and dancing throughout the day, and drama group performances on the key objectives of International Men's Day. Plans exist for the Tanzanian Men's Rights Organisation (TAMRA) to celebrate International men's day in 2013.|$|E
25|$|Although Malaka {{became a}} datuk, {{he left his}} village in October 1913 to study at Rijkskweekschool, a {{government}} teacher education school which was funded by engkus of his village. Arriving at the Netherlands, Malaka initially experienced a culture shock. He also, under-estimating the North European climate, was infected by a pleuritis in early 1914, which did not heal completely until in 1915. During his time in Europe, his knowledge about revolution {{as a mean to}} transformation of society started to increase. The first inspiration source was de Fransche Revolutie, a book by the German historian, author, journalist and social democratic politician Wilhelm Blos 1889, about the French revolution and historical events in France from 1789 until 1804. This book was given to him by Horensma. After the Russian Revolution of October 1917, Malaka increasingly became more and more interested in communism and socialism and communism contra reformist socialism. He was reading the books by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, and Vladimir Lenin. Friedrich Nietzsche was also one of his early political <b>role</b> <b>models,</b> <b>and</b> may have given him the idea that one man could perform great deeds if he only dared to assume the role of hero. Nietzsche argued that what makes a hero (at least in Greek tragedy) is an interplay between the Apollonian and Dionysian nature in man – or between the controlled, distanced, structured logical planning (Apollonian) and the wild euphoric, closeness of experience (Dionysian). During this time, around 1917 – 1920 Malaka highly disliked Dutch culture and was impressed by the German and American societies. He then signed up to be a German soldier; however, he was rejected because the German Army did not accept foreigners. There, Malaka met Henk Sneevliet, {{one of the founders of}} Indische Sociaal-Democratische Vereeniging (ISDV, forerunner of Partai Komunis Indonesia or PKI). Malaka was also interested in Sociaal-Democratische Onderwijzers Vereeniging (Association of Democrat Social Teachers). In November 1919 Malaka graduated and received his diploma, hulpactie. According to his father, during that time they communicated via mystical means called Tariqa.|$|E

500|$|Palm Island has {{an extreme}} level of theft, {{domestic}} violence, sexual assaults against children and abject drunkenness. This behaviour is attributed locally to boredom, aimlessness, lack of education, absence of <b>role</b> <b>models</b> <b>and</b> a complete loss of self-worth. Another important factor is bitter family divisions which rule {{the social fabric}} of the island and a complex web of historical disputes between those families, some going back decades. [...] Criminologist Dr Paul Wilson found Palm Island {{to have one of}} the highest rates of violent crime in the world. He suggested that the problems could be tied to repression of the past and colonial practices. In the December 2004 to December 2005 period there were 76admissions to the hospital for assault involving residents, 26times the standard Queensland rate.|$|E
500|$|During his 16-year NBA career, Barkley was {{regarded}} as one of the most controversial, outspoken and dominating players in the history of basketball. His impact on the sport went beyond his rebounding titles, assists, scoring and physical play.

[...] Although his words often led to controversy, according to Barkley his mouth was never the cause because it always spoke the truth. He stated, [...] "I don't create controversies.
