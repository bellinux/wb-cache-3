40|$|A unique {{circumstance}} {{created by}} monitoring a pre-driven longwall recovery room permitted measuring {{the stresses of}} a coal pillar throughout its entire life cycle {{in less than a}} week. A fender pillar, created in approximately the middle of a longwall panel at a depth of 650 ft, transformed from a solid barrier pillar - to a yielding pillar - to a <b>residual</b> <b>pillar</b> as 3 ft slices were methodically removed with the longwall shearer. The complete transformation, or life cycle, took place in less than 12 hours. The stresses were quickly transferred from the pillar onto the standing pumpable concrete supports and into the outby pillars. Roof to floor closure measurements, combined with the timing of the pillar behavior, provides a detailed look at the uncontrollable convergence of underground mine openings. Pillars remain the most important form of primary support and understanding these life cycles is vital for safe and efficient mine design, in both room and pillar and longwall panel extractions...|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} of possibilities of utilizing other coal mining methods not used yet {{under conditions of}} rock and gas outburst hazard in the Ostrava-Karviná Coalfield (henceforth referred to as OKR) in the Czech Republic is one of outputs of the research project “Protection of Employees against Consequences of Rock and Gas Outbursts”. These methods were to supplement a single method {{that had been in}} common use by then – longwall mining along the strike, and were to ensure the better recovery of coal reserves [1]. Specifically, it was the case of mining of residual pillars blocking a considerable quantity of coal. What was chosen was a promising mining method utilising long large diameter boreholes. In the article the experience of application of this mining method abroad as well as under conditions of OKR in seams with a hazard of rock and gas outbursts is presented.

40|$|Abstract. The Pinglidian {{gold mine}} locates at the Laizhou city, Shandong province, China. Up to 2013, the orebodies had been mined out, however, there is leaving mined voids of about 120, 000 m 2 and also leaving {{a large number}} of ore <b>pillars.</b> The <b>residual</b> <b>pillars</b> have to be recovered. In order to safely recover those <b>residual</b> <b>pillars</b> in the mine, some rock {{mechanics}} study work, including the detection of roof loosening layer depth of mined voids, the 3 -d numerical modeling and the field monitoring of the stresses changing of pillars adjacent to recovering operation, has been done, and for recovery operation of backfill method with hydraulic prop supporting, the required mechanical properties of cemented tailings fill materials have been tested. Finally, a trial recovering stope has been successfully and safely mined...|$|R
50|$|The {{room and}} pillar method allowed an {{increasing}} mechanization of stoping operations {{that led to the}} use of drilling machines, first by compressed air and then electro-hydraulic. It also allowed the use of loaders, first by compressed air, then electrical and presently diesel. The cost of labor and materials associated to the wooden piles for total recovery of the ore, is the reason why <b>residual</b> <b>pillars</b> with ore (16%) are left behind, leading to a 84% recovery of the deposit.|$|R
40|$|One of outputs of the {{research}} project of the Czech Mining Office “Protection of Employees against Consequences of Rock and Gas Outbursts” was the application of yet not used methods of coal mining in {{the conditions of the}} Czech Republic. The aim of these methods is an increase in the recovery of coal reserves blocked in <b>residual</b> <b>pillars</b> left. For the conditions of Paskov Mine (Ostrava-Karviná Mines company) [1], the method of mining by means of long large diameter boreholes was chosen.

40|$|Shallow depth coal seams {{are widely}} spread in Shendong mining area, {{which is located}} in the Northwestern region of China. When working face is {{advanced}} out of concentrated coal pillar in upper room and pillar goaf, strong strata behaviors often cause support crushing accidents, and potentially induce large area <b>residual</b> <b>pillars</b> instability and even wind blast disaster. In order to predict the precise time when the accident happens, guaranteeing life-safety of miner, microseismic monitoring system was for the first time applied in shallow coal seam. Based on damage mechanics correlation theory, the damage energy model is established to describe relationship between damage level and cumulative energy of microseismic events. According to microseismic monitoring data of two support crushing accidents, the damage energy model is verified and an effective early warning method of these accidents is proposed. The field application showed that the early warning method had avoided miners suffering from all support crushing accidents in Shigetai coal mine...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUsing the way {{of driving}} and filling by solid wastes to replace parts of coal is an {{important}} technical path for solving protective coal pillar of "under three" coal mining and industry square in our coal mine, and the key depends on whether the new bearing structure formed by backfill and <b>residual</b> <b>pillars</b> can effectively substitute for the original large coal pillars or not. We obtained the influencing factors from stable dual bearing structure by the establishing mathematical model and researching on mechanism of overlying strata of dual bearing structure. Combined with the actual condition of protective band coal pillar of filling and recovery, some elements which are important to coal pillar stability have been researched, such as {{the width of the}} middle pillar, quantity of filling roadway, size of filling roadway, and grade of filling roadway. The results are successfully applied to the recovery of protective band coal pillar in the 4 th region of the 1300 mining area that its surface is stability and some parts of coal pillars are recovered, and thus obtain a well engineering application purpose and economy benefit...|$|R
40|$|Coal and gas outbursts {{are one of}} {{risk factors}} {{accompanying}} the mining of coal in low seams in the Ostrava-Karviná Coalfield. At {{the use of the}} method of longwall mining, all coal reserves have not been mined out owing to tectonic faults. For mining out the residual reserves, the application of a new mining method - drilling of a coal pillar was proposed. The method of mining of a coal seam utilizing long large diameter boreholes is verified in the Paskov Mine (company OKD, JSC – Czech Republic) under conditions of rock mass with hazard of rock and gas outbursts in localities of <b>residual</b> <b>pillars</b> left in seams after finishing the mining operations performed with using the classical method of longwall working along the strike. [5] Forecast and preventive measures applied to the verification of the new method were based on previous experience with the mining of seams with hazard of coal and gas outbursts. They accepted fully valid legislation, i. e. Ordinance of Ostrava Regional Mining Authority No. 3895 / 2002 and supplementary materials (Instructions and Guidelines). The proposed measures respected the character of the method being verified. [4] For all areas being mined, projects containing also chapters specifying the problems of ensuring the safety of mining works and operation under conditions of hazard of coal and gas outbursts were prepared. In the contributions, basic proposals for the principles of coal and gas outburst forecast and prevention when applying the new mining method – drilling of a coal pillar are presented...|$|R
30|$|The copper {{ore deposit}} {{exploited}} by KGHM Polish Copper Ltd. {{is located in}} Fore-Sudetic Monocline within the LGOM of south-western part of Poland. Copper ore extraction in Poland is concentrated in three underground mines: Lubin, Rudna and Polkowice-Sieroszowice. The depth of deposits in LGOM ranges from 600  m in Lubin mine, to more than 1100  m in Rudna mine. Copper minerals are hosted by three main lithological Zechstein rock types: sandstone, shale and dolomite. Generally, the rock mass {{in the area of}} copper mines in LGOM is characterized by a layered structure. In a majority of the area, the thick dolomite layer occurs directly above the excavations roof. The dolomite rocks are characterized by a relatively high strength and small deformability. In the floor instead the weaker sandstone rocks are deposited. The copper ore exploitation is conducted by the room-and-pillar mining system with adopting the technique using the phenomenon of natural roof settlement. The principle of this solution is to eliminate the extracted voids by the deflection of the roof and prop it on the <b>residual</b> technological <b>pillars</b> as well as by self-acting roof fall (Butra et al. 1996).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} a limit equilibrium model to simulate the behaviour of crush pillars in platinum mines. An analytical model was derived to calculate the <b>residual</b> average <b>pillar</b> stress (APS) values of the crush pillars. The values predicted by this model were compared to the numerical values obtained from TEXAN simulations. In general, the limit equilibrium model appears to be very attractive for simulating pillar failure as the gradual crushing of {{the outside of the}} pillar and the transfer of stress to the intact core can be replicated. The value of the TEXAN crush pillar model was further demonstrated by simulating an idealized layout with crush pillars between two adjacent panels. The simulations illustrated that oversized pillars will not crush close to the face and this may lead to seismic failure in the back area. An important finding of the study is that closure measurements may prove to be a very valuable diagnostic measure in crush pillars layouts. Distinct differences in magnitudes of closure were simulated for a scenario where the pillars crush as expected, compared to the scenario where an oversized pillar is left. Experimental closure data collected in a crush pillar stope provided further evidence regarding the value of closure measurements in these layouts. This work forms part of the PhD study of Mr M. du Plessis at the University of Pretoria. [URL]...|$|R
