40|$|There {{are many}} {{situations}} in which deception may arise and understanding the behaviors associated with it are compounded by various contexts in which it may occur. This paper sets out a coding protocol for identifying cues to deception and reports on three studies, in which deception was studied in different contexts. The contexts involved manipulating risks (i. e., probability) of being detected and reconnaissance, {{both of which are}} related to terrorist activities. Two of the studies examined the impact <b>of</b> changing the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> detection, whilst the third investigated increased cognitive demand <b>of</b> duplex <b>deception</b> tasks including reconnaissance and deception. In all three studies, cues to deception were analyzed in relation to observable body movements and subjective impressions given by participants. In general, the results indicate a pattern of hand movement reduction by deceivers, and suggest the notion that raising the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> detection influences deceivers’ behaviors. Participants in the higher risk condition displayed increased negative affect (found in deceivers) and tension (found in both deceivers and truth-tellers) than those in lower risk conditions...|$|R

Studying adherence {{is complicated by the}} potential for the study environment to impact adherence behavior. Studies performed without informing patients about adherence monitoring must balance the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> against the potential benefits of the knowledge to be gained. Ethically monitoring a patient’s {{adherence to}} a treatment plan without full disclosure of the monitoring plan requires protecting the patient’s rights and upholding the fiduciary obligations of the investigator. Adherence monitoring can utilize different levels <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> varying from stealth monitoring, debriefing after the study while informing the subject that some information had been withheld in regard to the use of adherence monitoring (withholding), informed consent that discloses some form of adherence monitoring is being used and will be disclosed {{at the end of the}} study (authorized deception), and full disclosure. Different approaches offer different benefits and potential pitfalls. The approach used must balance the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> nondisclosure against the potential for confounding the adherence monitoring data and the potential benefits that adherence monitoring data will have for the research subjects and/or other populations. This commentary aims to define various methods of adherence monitoring and to provide a discussion of the ethical considerations that accompany the use of each method and adherence monitoring in general as it is used in clinical research.

40|$|Introduction & Objectives: This study {{examines}} {{the views of}} parentsand professionals on internet use for sexual purposes among youngpeople with intellectual disabilities (18 – 20 yrs.). Although media atten-tion focuses heavily on the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> on the Internet and on easyaccess to pornography, the main concern is articulated in relation tovulnerable groups’ usage. While people with intellectual disabilitiesrequire support by their surroundings, {{we need to know}} more abouttheir views on internet usage. Methods: Five semi-structured focus group interviews were con-ducted with professionals (n = 8) working at special schools and withparents (n = 5). The interviews were analysed with thematic analysis,with the theory of sexual scripts guiding the process. Results: The internet is seen as a social arena with complex challengesfor (1) love and sexuality (2), sexual conduct, and (3) sexual risk andopportunities. Even though people with intellectual disabilities areregarded as more vulnerable than other youths, their parents view therisk of their adolescent being lonely as greater than the risk of thembeing abused or misled. Further, girls are viewed as more vulnerableand contact seeking on the internet than boys. Moreover, pornographysites are discussed only {{when it comes to the}} boys’ behaviour. Dating unknown persons is connected to the girls’ behaviour. A Net-script consisting of rules is geared towards the young people with anintellectual disability. However, a change to a more nuanced Net-script is shown while the group of youth with intellectual disabilities are seenas more heterogeneous than in earlier research. Conclusion: In-depth knowledge about parents’ and professionals’perspectives on the internet and sexuality is important as their attitudesand behaviour are essential for the young peoples’ access to supportand for opportunities to develop their own capacity and to experiencelove and sexuality...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} a {{contribution}} to the public debate about demographic challenges caused by an increasing elderly population and lack of professional care to support them. The Norwegian Technology Board has given some advice towards a future health care for elders, among them supporting the implementation of robot technologies. One robot that is in use already at Norwegian elderly care centres is a social robot shaped as a seal puppy with thick white fur and big black eyes; the mental commitment robot PARO. Especially elderly demented people are said to calm down and become more socialised if the robot is present. The thesis sets out to investigate how the mental commitment robot PARO has been interpreted and adapted by different groups at residential and treatment centres for people with dementia; which ethical aspects emerge when a robot like PARO is introduced or evaluated in elderly care; and finally how does the introduction of PARO in elderly care influence care practises and knowledge? The descriptive framework, Social Construction of Technology (SCOT), by Wiebe Bijker and Trevor Pinch is the main theory in use to answer these questions. The thesis analyses how relevant social groups form and interpret the technology, demonstrating the interpretative flexibility of the robot. This flexibility comes from social negotiations among the members of different social groups, more than technical properties of the artefact. The empirical material was collected through semi structured interviews of sixteen respondents working at dementia care centres, distributors, and governmental advisory organisations. The {{study is a}}pproved by the National Data Protection Official for Research (NSD), given the project number 24540. NSD has demanded that sites and people described in this study are kept anonymous; protecting the vulnerable group of demented elders. The SCOT analysis has revealed that the robot is interpreted {{in a wide range of}} different ways. Major solutions the robot fulfils are that it calm down elders, it increases social contact and is a new distraction that makes the caregivers more observant towards the elders, enabling the carer to see the elder in a new way. Major issues with the robot are that it is highly expensive equipment, stigmatising in some situations and creates a <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> due to its animal characteristics. The thesis concludes that a traditional caring paradigm competes with a new robot care paradigm. However, the caregiver and the social factors are crucial elements to why the robot works so well at some places, while not working in other situations.

Here we demonstrate that providing even a simple, abstracted real-time visualisation of a robot’s AI can radically improve the transparency of machine cognition. Findings from both an online experiment using a video recording of a robot, and from direct observation of a robot show substantial improvements in observers’ understanding of the robot’s behaviour. Unexpectedly, this improved understanding was correlated in one condition with an increased perception that the robot was ‘thinking’, but in no conditions was the robot’s assessed intelligence impacted.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis explores {{the history of}} U. S. Army deception and doctrine, and combines the insights gained with the various works on deception, cognitive psychology, communications, and decision-making in order to distill a concise handbook for deception practitioners. A longitudinal review of U. S. Army doctrine reveals a wide variation in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>deception,</b> from emphasized to ignored. This variation can be primarily explained by the U. S. preference for the cumulative destruction style {{of war and the}} perceived balance of power between the U. S. and its adversaries. This thesis strives to fill the current doctrinal gap by distilling the existing body of work to create a theory <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> in the military context. The theory presented provides a cogent structure, taxonomy, and lexicon, as well as, emphasis on how deception functions within the frameworks of communications and decision-making. Next, a synthesis of the practice <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> is presented, with a focus on deception planning and the essential elements <b>of</b> <b>deception</b> practice. Examples <b>of</b> U.
