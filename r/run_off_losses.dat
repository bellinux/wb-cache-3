6000|$|But Strickland took long counsel {{with his}} wife, and she with the {{cheque-book}} and their lean bank-account, {{and they decided}} that Adam must go [...] "home" [...] to his aunts. But England is not home to a child that has been born in India, and it never becomes home-like unless he spends all his youth there. The bank-book showed that if they economised through the summer by going to a cheap hill-station instead of to Simla, where Mrs. Strickland's parents lived, and where Strickland might be noticed by the powers, they could send Adam home in the next spring. It would be hard pinching, {{but it could be}} done. In India all the money that people in other lands save against a rainy day <b>runs</b> <b>off</b> in <b>loss</b> by exchange, which to-day cuts a man's income down almost exactly to one-half There is nothing to show for money when all is put by, and that is what makes married life there so hard. Strickland used to say, sometimes, that he envied the convicts in the jail. They had no position to keep up, and the ball and chain that the worst of them wore was only a few pounds weight of iron.|$|R
40|$|The {{cavitation}} erosion behavior of Inconel 690 alloy was investigated using 20 -kHz vibratory cavitation test equipment and analyzed by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM). To clarify the development of cavitation damage with time, scanning electron photographs were recorded for various test durations, where the time was measured from the commencement of vibration. The {{results showed that the}} {{cavitation erosion}} damage in Inconel 690 alloy occurred initially at the grain boundary, twin boundary, and the interface between the precipitate and the matrix. Pitting also occurred along with cavitation. The causes of the weight loss in the incubation period were the small TiN precipitation <b>run</b> <b>off</b> and the <b>loss</b> of deformation area at not only the grain boundary but also the twin boundary. In the acceleration period, the weight loss originated from the combined effect of big craters that resulted in larger volumes of material loss. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
