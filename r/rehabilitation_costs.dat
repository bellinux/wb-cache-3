Following his son's death, O'Connor appeared in public service announcements for Partnership for a Drug Free America and {{spent the rest of}} his life working to raise awareness about drug addiction. O'Connor also successfully lobbied to get the state of California to pass legislation allowing family members of an addicted person or anyone injured by a drug dealer's actions, including employers, to sue for reimbursement for medical treatment and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>costs</b> and other economic and noneconomic damages. The law, known as the Drug Dealer Civil Liability Act in California, went into effect in 1997. It is also referred to as the Hugh O'Connor Memorial Law. The act is based on the Model Drug Dealer Liability Act authored in 1992 by then Hawaii U.S. Attorney Daniel Bent. The Model Drug Dealer Liability Act has been passed in 17 states and the Virgin Islands. A website devoted to the Act can be found at: www.ModelDDLA.com.

40|$|Operations {{excellence}} in inpatient rehabilitation {{is critical to}} coordinate care transitions for people with serious illness and injury. Public insurers typically only pay inpatient rehabilitation services within {{a certain period of}} time regardless of the patient 2 ̆ 7 s recovery condition. Furthermore, the funded inpatient rehabilitation length of stay (RLOS) is determined without much quantitative analysis. Such an 2 ̆ 2 ad-hoc one-fit-all 2 ̆ 2 approach is often questionable, especially when inpatient rehabilitation service providers are under pressure of discharging patients early to control the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost,</b> meanwhile maintaining their readmission risks. Keeping the right balance between these two outcomes is imperative in achieving a cost-effective system. In this research, we present a stochastic process to model the care transition. We report a simulation study to evaluate the process for a cohort of publically funded traumatic brain injury patients and explore the tradeoff between the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost</b> and readmission risk. We systematically vary the funded RLOS within each patient cluster to identify promising discharge timing policies. Following the preliminary results obtained through the simulation experiments, we introduce a search heuristic within the framework of our model. The genetic algorithm based simulation optimization algorithm that arose out of this approach optimizes the RLOS within each cluster by identifying the ideal combination of RLOS over all clusters that would minimize both the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost</b> and the readmission risk. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the influence of overloaded truck traffic on the pavement damage and its <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost</b> of Benghazi Street in Misurata city, Libya. Evaluation of allocated <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost</b> also becomes concern of this study to determine the sufficiency of the cost. The objectives of this study are to know the influence of overloaded truck traffic towards the pavement damage; to know the overloaded truck traffic towards rehabilitation cost; and to evaluate sufficiency of the allocated <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost</b> based on the actual condition of the pavement rehabilitation needs. Pavement Condition Index (PCI), Equivalent Standard Axle Loads (ESAL) factors calculation were carried out in this study. PCI determined to rate the pavement damage condition based on damage that found at Benghazi Street. ESAL of the traffic determined by AASHTO 1993 standard to get the damage factor due to axle loads. Further the evaluation of allocated <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>cost</b> was conducted based on the ESAL of the traffic by comparing the standard normal ESAL with the ESAL of overloaded truck traffic. The PCI result determined the highest rate of the pavement condition was 71. 0 and the lowest one was 6. 0. It was retrieved from 21 segments along 2100 meters of Benghazi Street, 17 segments attained under 50 and it was only 3 segments attained above 50 value of PCI. The PCI of total area resumed the value of 31. 5 which means a very poor pavement condition rate. In other result, ESAL of truck traffic attained up to 953, 230 where the ESAL of normal load determined only 327, 964. Ratio of both was 2. 90 which mean overload ESAL 290 % higher than normal one. The maintenance cost of normal ESAL determined 2. 39 dinar Libya/ ESAL and it reached up to 2, 276, 030. 28 dinar. The maintenance cost needs to be adjusted 65 % more than allocated maintenance cost. It can be concluded that the maintenance cost for the next periods should be planned well based on the actual ESAL investigation {{so that it can be}} managed to suitable cost and sufficient service for safety and comfort of the user...|$|R

40|$|Due to low visibility, sewer {{systems are}} {{difficult}} to monitor, maintain and rehabilitate. To prevent failures, environmental pollution, and wastewater treatment overflow, regular rehabilitation of sewage is necessary.

The optimization model was designed {{to search for a}} Pareto curve (or trade-off front) consisting of a set of optimal solutions with desirable rehabilitation effectiveness at the least cost.

50|$|The {{basic premise}} of {{infrastructure}} asset management is to intervene at strategic points in an asset’s normal life cycle {{to extend the}} expected service life, and thereby maintain its performance. Typically, a long-life-cycle asset requires multiple intervention points including a combination of repair and maintenance activities and even overall <b>rehabilitation.</b> <b>Costs</b> decrease with planned maintenance rather than unplanned maintenance. Yet, excessive planned maintenance increases costs. Thus, {{a balance between the}} two must be recognized. While each improvement raises an asset’s condition curve, each rehabilitation resets an asset’s condition curve, and complete replacement returns condition curve to new level or upgraded level. Therefore, strategically timing these interventions will aid in extending an asset’s life cycle. A simple working definition of asset management would be: first, assess what you have; then, assess what condition it is in; and lastly, assess the financial burden to maintain it at a targeted condition.|$|E
