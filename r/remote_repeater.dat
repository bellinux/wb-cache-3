40|$|More {{and more}} people {{worldwide}} are becoming “carbon conscious”. This means they are becoming increasingly aware of the imminent adverse effects of global warming. Of late {{there has been an}} urgent drive for governments to be on the forefront of all carbon mitigation initiatives. One such drive involves the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change whose parties have been meeting regularly under the banner of Conference of Parties (COP) since 1995. At this conference, parties to the convention review progress made in dealing with climate change. Also key to the deliberations in such meetings are better ways of developing cleaner “carbon free” energy sources. Energy sources of this nature are commonly known as renewable energy sources. In essence global energy trends are constantly moving towards development of more renewable energy sources. It is an undeniable fact that some of viable renewable energy sources especially those with bulk capacity are usually located remotely from load centers. This inevitable reality necessitates the construction of long distance bulk power transmission corridors to link generation sites with load centers. Due to its many inherent advantages over High Voltage Alternate Current (HVAC) for long distance power transmission, High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) is gradually winning the favor of many utilities. In fact, recent advances in HVDC technology have encouraged many utilities to explore the possibility of harnessing remotely located renewable energy sources which would have otherwise not been viable with HVAC transmission. Through the unfortunate and inevitable phenomenon known as corona effect, overhead HVDC conductors suffer real power losses to the air dielectric surrounding them. Through corona, part of the energy carried on the transmission line is expended through ionization and movement of charges in the air dielectric. This study combined physics, mathematical as well engineering concepts to review corona phenomenon around HVDC lines with specific emphasis on space charge generation and motion within ionized DC fields as well as the influence of temperature on corona discharge or power loss. Also, unlike HVAC, performance of an HVDC system relies heavily on the availability of a reliable and robust telecommunication system. One of the key ways of ensuring reliability of a telecommunication system is by making sure that reliable power supplies are in place to power <b>remote</b> <b>repeater</b> stations. A novel concept of quasi-autonomous corona-based power supply (or QC power supply in short) that works on the principle of magnetohydrodymic (MHD) power generation was developed. A small scale experiment was then designed to assess the feasibility of such power supplies. The experiment was conducted with DC supply of a maximum rated voltage of 30 kVDC and generated up to 6 VDC at an optimum ambient temperature of 23 °C. These results have confirmed that with further development QC power supplies have the potential of proving reliable power to remotely located repeaters or any other small critical loads along the stretch of the HVDC transmission line. Practical HVDC transmission systems operate voltages in the excess of 500 kV. By linear extrapolation of the above mentioned results; one would expect to yield up to 100 -, 120 - and 160 -VDC from a 500 -, 600 - and 800 - kV HVDC system, respectively. Although the study succeeded in conceptualizing a CMHD idea upon which the novel QC power supply was developed, quite extensive and rigorous design, modeling, prototyping and experimentation processes are still required before the first QC power supply can be commissioned on a practical HVDC lin...|$|E

50|$|Not all radio {{transmissions}} are prohibited {{in the core}} of the Radio Quiet Zone. For example, emergency service (police, fire, and ambulance) radios and Citizen's Band radio are permitted. However, large transmitter owners must typically coordinate their operations with the NRAO. The only broadcast radio stations are part of the Allegheny Mountain Radio network—with just one station in the AM band, and several low-power FM stations. Exceptions to restrictions are usually determined on a case-by-case basis, with preference given to public safety concerns, such as <b>remote</b> alarm systems, <b>repeaters</b> for emergency services, and NOAA Weather Radio.|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 2002 Fuel Cell Seminar, Palm Springs, CA, November 2002 The Schatz Energy Research Center (SERC) has designed, built, and {{operated}} a PEM fuel cell power system that supplies back-up {{power to a}} <b>remote</b> radio-telephone <b>repeater.</b> The repeater, located within Redwood National Park in northwestern California, {{is part of the}} Yurok Indian Reservation???s telecommunications system. A photovoltaic (PV) system with batteries provides primary power for the repeater. When solar insolation is insufficient to maintain battery state-ofcharge, the 100 -Watt fuel cell system starts automatically and provides clean, quiet, reliable power. The system began unattended operation in November 1999. The original fuel cell stack logged 3239 hours of run time. In January 2001, SERC engineers refurbished the original fuel cell stack, incorporating improved membrane-electrode assemblies and gas diffusion media. The original resin-impregnated graphite was replaced with pyrosealed components and a temperaturecontrolled fan switch was added to protect the stack from sudden temperature increases while minimizing parasitic loads. The system ran continuously though October 2001, accumulating 3836 hours of run time and completing 283 start-stop cycles. The system and the original stack are described in detail in two earlier papers [1, 2]. This paper will focus on the performance of the second stack used in the system.

40|$|Abstract – The loop {{plant can}} be {{optimized}} to provide significantly higher bit rates than currently provided, offering higher speeds {{that in some}} cases will even support digital entertainment video, without installing new <b>remote</b> terminals or <b>repeaters.</b> Algorithms for using measured crosstalk data to jointly optimize DSL performance have been recently published, and are based on finding the optimal transmit PSD in an iterative fashion. However, these algorithms can ensure joint optimization of homogenous DSL services only. In this paper, we present an iterative algorithm for jointly optimizing single-carrier and multicarrier DSL services. In particular, we address the case of joint optimization of ADSL and G. shdsl. Simulations are run with many different crosstalk couplings for several scenarios of loop length and numbers of crosstalkers. Simulation results show that average bit rate increases of several hundred percent are commonly achieved on relatively long loops with these Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM) techniques. I...|$|R
40|$|This Corrective Action Investigation Plan {{contains}} the U. S. Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office's approach {{to collect the}} data necessary to evaluate corrective action alternatives appropriate for the closure of Corrective Action Unit (CAU) 409 under the Federal Facility Agreement and Consent Order. Corrective Action Unit 409 consists of three Corrective Action Sites (CASs) : TA- 53 - 001 -TAB 2, Septic Sludge Disposal Pit No. 1; TA- 53 - 002 -TAB 2, Septic Sludge Disposal Pit No. 2; and RG- 24 - 001 -RGCR, Battery Dump Site. The Septic Sludge Disposal Pits are located near Bunker Two, close to Area 3, on the Tonopah Test Range. The Battery Dump Site {{is located at the}} abandoned Cactus Repeater Station on Cactus Peak. The Cactus Repeater Station was a <b>remote,</b> battery-powered, signal <b>repeater</b> station. The two Septic Sludge Disposal Pits were suspected to be used through the late 1980 s as disposal sites for sludge from septic tanks located in Area 3. Based on site history collected to support the Data Quality Objectives process, contaminants of potential concern are the same for the disposal pits and include: volatile organic compounds (VOCs), semivolatile organic compounds, total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) as gasoline- and diesel-range organics, polychlorinated biphenyls, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act metals, and radionuclides (including plutonium and depleted uranium). The Battery Dump Site consists of discarded lead-acid batteries and associated construction debris, placing the site in a Housekeeping Category and, consequently, no contaminants are expected to be encountered during the cleanup process. The corrective action the at this CAU will include collection of discarded batteries and construction debris at the Battery Dump Site for proper disposal and recycling, along with photographic documentation as the process progresses. The corrective action for the remaining CASs involves the collection of background radiological data through borings drilled at undisturbed locations near the area of the disposal pits; field screening samples for radiological constituents; analysis for geotechnical/hydrologic parameters of samples beneath the disposal pits; and bioassessment samples, if VOC or TPH contamination concentrations exceed field-screening levels. The results of this field investigation will support a defensible evaluation of corrective action alternatives in the corrective action decision document...|$|R
