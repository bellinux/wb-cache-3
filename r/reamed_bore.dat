40|$|ABSTRACT: To make {{understand}} the application {{and importance of}} the involvement of automation in conventional drilling machine in manufacturing. A drilling machine comes in many shapes and sizes, from small hand-held power drills to bench mounted and finally floor-mounted models. They can perform operations other than drilling, such as countersinking, counter <b>boring,</b> <b>reaming,</b> and tapping large or small holes. Because the drilling machines can perform all o f these operations, this paper will also cover the types of drill bits, tool, and shop formulas for setting up each operation. Safety plays a critical part in any operation involving power equipment. This paper will cover procedures for servicing, maintaining, and setting up the work, proper methods of selecting tools, and wor...|$|R
40|$|The CNC {{machine tools}} are spatial {{machines}} that {{are able to}} control computer. There are two types of machine tools structure, C-frame and gantry-frame. A CNC gantry machine tool is defined as a computer numerically controlled machine that is programmed and controlled through a computer. Its CNC controller offers very short setup time flexibility to run batches of one to several thousand. Today, the CNC gantry machines are widely used in manufacturing combined with software programs to efficiently and consistently create different products for large companies or even single consumers. The CNC gantry machine is used in the manufacturing sector including drilling, milling, <b>reaming,</b> <b>boring</b> and counter boring. Parts can be grooved and threaded with CNC milling centers; they can be transformed into CNC lathes, CNC drill and tap areas; for CNC grinding; and used in conjunction with routers to make CNC wood engravers and letterers. The CNC gantry machine can be used to machine small, large, short and lengthy components. Currently, {{there are two types of}} such machines in the market. The first type has a moving worktable and fixed gantry and the second type has a moving gantry and fixed worktable. Each type has advantages and disadvantages. In this study, a new concept is proposed to improve the specifications and applicability of the first type of CNC gantry machine. In the new concept, reciprocal and simultaneous motion of the gantry and worktable is proposed as the gantry machine’s X-axis double motion mechanism. At the beginning of this study, the double motion mechanism is designed based on a rack and pinion system. A new anti-backlash system is proposed to compensate for transmission error and backlash (simultaneously) and for use in the double motion mechanism. The simulation results of the new anti-backlash system are discussed. Due to manufacturing limitations of the rack and pinion systems, a new double motion mechanism based on a ball screw system is proposed. Then, various designs of a new CNC gantry machine are presented. In this improvement process the problem is solved with the new design of a completed CNC gantry machine. The dynamic and static behavior of the final CNC gantry machine design is investigated via modal and static structural analysis using ANSYS software. The gantry’s natural frequency is designed to be 202 Hz in the first vibration mode, making the machine capable of working at higher speeds of up to 11530 rpm, which is suitable not only for rough cutting but also for finishing. The final design of the new CNC gantry machine is updated according to the obtained results. The increase in natural frequency during gantry design modification affects complexity, increasing the weight and manufacturing cost of the gantry. As such, five different gantry designs are selected for comparison. Four parameters, i. e., the first four natural frequencies, total deformation due to mechanical forces, weight and manufacturing cost are considered performance indices. One is selected among five designs mathematically and optimized by MOGA (multi-objective genetic algorithm) in ANSYS software. In the optimization process, the gantry’s natural frequency is maximized, thus minimizing the total gantry weight and deformation against mechanical forces. CNC gantry machine documents for manufacturing are prepared, followed by modeling, casting, machining and assembly. To evaluate and verify the design and analysis, an experimental modal test is performed. The experimental results show less than 11...|$|R
40|$|Meeting the {{challenge}} of the ever increasing problems caused by the use of cooling lubricants, like pollution, health risks and incresing costs for disposal, an industrial initiative started the collaborative project 'Dry Machining' in September 1994 (project duration: 3 years). The RTD project concentrates on the development of special tools and methods for machining and cutting without the use of cooling lubricants. The technological aim envisaged is to develop and implement dry machining technology which integrates - the materials which are of major importance for general mechanical engineering (cast iron, steel, alloys with aluminium and other alloy castings) as well as - the manufacturing processes which are necessary for the machining of prismatic units (drilling, precision <b>boring,</b> <b>reaming,</b> thread cutting, thread pressing, deep drilling, milling). The collaborative project also aims at quickly applying and implementing the results from RTD work into industrial practice. (orig.)

40|$|Crank case as the {{foundation}} for almost all engine parts are mounted her machine. Such as transmission gear shaft, crank shaft, shaft coupling, bushing and various other components. All of components are related to each other, if components are not installed with precision, the machine rejected. Manufacturing of the crank case begins with the die casting process, face milling, drilling, <b>boring,</b> <b>reaming,</b> spot facing and tapping. The most important process is the face milling. Face milling is done {{on both sides of the}} crank case R & L, which will both be united. Therefore, it takes surface roughness 12. 5 μm, flat and level, because if there are scratches on the crank case surface after combined oil seepage will occur. It is already a reject. It required an analysis of the failure of face milling process by considering several things, namely machining parameters are used, the condition of the cutting tool,the installation of the crank case on the jig and the coolant used. Analyzing the four factors above, it is hoped will be able to optimize the face milling process as well as reduced product reject. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{useful life}} of a cutting tool and its {{operating}} conditions largely control {{the economics of the}} machining operations. Hence, it is imperative that the condition of the cutting tool, particularly some indication as to when it requires changing, to be monitored. The drilling operation is frequently used as a preliminary step for many operations like <b>boring,</b> <b>reaming</b> and tapping, however, the operation itself is complex and demanding Back propagation neural networks were used for detection of drill wear. The neural network consisted of three layers input, hidden and output. Drill size, feed, spindle speed, torque, machining time and thrust force are given as inputs to the ANN and the flank wear was estimated. Drilling experiments with 8 mm drill size were performed by changing the cutting speed and feed at two different levels. The number of neurons in the hidden layer were selected from 1, 2, 3, [...] ., 20. The learning rate was selected as 0. 01 and no smoothing factor was used. The estimated values of tool wear were obtained by statistical analysis and by various neural network structures. Comparative analysis has been done between statistical analysis, neural network structures and the actual values of tool wear obtained by experimentation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

The useful life of cutting tool and its operating conditions largely controls the economics of machining operations. Drilling is most frequently performed material removing process and {{is used as a}} preliminary step for many operations, such as <b>reaming,</b> tapping, and <b>boring.</b> Drill wear has a bad effect on the surface finish and dimensional accuracy of the work piece. The surface finish of a machined part {{is one of the most}} important quality characteristics in manufacturing industries. The primary objective of this research is the prediction of suitable parameters for surface roughness in drilling. Cutting speed, cutting force, and machining time were given as inputs to the adaptive fuzzy neural network and neuro-fuzzy analysis for estimating the values of surface roughness by using 2, 3, 4, and 5 membership functions. The best structures were selected based on minimum of summation of square with the actual values with the estimated values by artificial neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and neuro-fuzzy systems.
