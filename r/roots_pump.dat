The tube contains a nutrient solution and delivers it to the <b>roots.</b> <b>Pumps</b> attached to the tubing create a very small suction that holds the solution within the tube. This system was used to grow wheat for 107 d in a controlled environment at suctions of 0. 40, 1. 48, or 2. 58 kPa. The water absorbed through the pores of the tube by baby diaper sections decreased as suction increased. Correspondingly, final plant biomass, seed number, and spikelet number also tended to decrease as suction increased. The reduced yield at higher suction suggests that the plants experienced water stress, although all suctions were below those typical of soils at field capacity...|$|R

An arc-jet generator operates in a cylindrical chamber of 1;1 m in diameter and 4.3 m length, pumped with 3 primary <b>pumps</b> and 3 <b>Roots</b> <b>pumps,</b> which capacity (27 000 m3/h) insures a residual pressure ranged between 1 and 100 Pa. Different working gases can be used like Argon, nitrogen, CO2, CH4 Air, allowing the simulation of several planetary entry conditions like earth (80%N2-20%O2), Mars (97%CO2-3%N2) or Titan (99% N2-1% CH4). The advantages of the home-made designed plasma source {{can be found in}} the stability of the plasma flow, the high specific enthalpy, up to 50 MJ/kg due to the low mass flow rate and the low rate of contamination which could provides from the erosion of the cathode.|$|R

Vacuum finds its applications in many areas including industry, space research, food processing. One should have knowledge on the generation of vacuum to understand its effects. This project mainly focuses on the experimental setup of the vacuum pumps. The study, design, construction and installation of vacuum pumping systems viz. Vacuum chamber, Rotary pump, <b>Roots</b> <b>pump</b> was done. The working of rotary and roots pumps was studied and a list proper and necessary components and accessories was prepared. The methods to calculate the pumping speed of a pump at a pressure range were studied namely constant volume and constant pressure methods. The experiments were carried out and observations are plotted in a graph. The concepts of leak detection were also studied. Finally, the project helps in establishment of vacuum technology laboratory at NIT Rourkela, giving a practical approach to the students dealing with the Vacuum Technology to understand the vacuum process and research can be continue...|$|E

The toroidal vacuum vessel, having a major radius of 2 m and a minor radius of 0. 475 m, is built in Inconel 625, and its inner surface is completely covered by 2016 graphite tiles. The residual final pressure {{should be in the}} range of 10 − 9 mbar; to reach the required vacuum conditions, 12 uhv pumping groups are provided, each of them including one turbo pump (1000 l s− 1) and one cryogenic pump (1500 l s− 1). Six forevacuum pump systems, each including one <b>roots</b> <b>pump</b> (double stage) and one rotary pump, assure the regeneration of the cryogenic pumps and the forevacuum conditions for the turbo pumps. The gas inlet system is designed to supply H 2 and D 2 to the vessel in very high purity conditions or in a pre-defined mixture with impurities. The plant control system can work either in manual or automatic mode: in manual mode the system is handled from ‘local operation panels’, whereas in automatic mode it is controlled by a ‘Programmable Logic Controller’ (PLC) {{which is part of the}} overall control and monitoring system of the RFX experiment.

40|$|Keeping {{the total}} vehicle weight as low as possible, i. e. {{maximising}} the pay load, {{is one of the}} main objectives of Martian missions. Therefore mainly the Aerocapture technique instead of propulsion systems is used to decelerate the vehicle during the entry phase. But, this configuration increases the requirements on the thermal protection systems of the re-entry vehicle. There is lack of reliable data of on the behaviour of potential TPS materials in the Martian atmosphere, which consists mainly of CO 2 (97 %) and N 2 (3 %) and produces further gas species like CO, O, N, NO, etc. in a shock layer or similar high enthalpy areas of the flow around the vehicle. The characterisation and qualification of TPS materials or components of these vehicles can only be performed in well calibrated long duration high enthalpy facilities. The arc heated facility L 2 K of DLR with an electrical power of 1. 4 MW has been intensively used for European space programmes like HERMES, MSTP, X- 38 /TETRA, etc [...] It used to be operated with air, nitrogen and argon as working gas. Recently the gas supply system of the facility has been upgraded in such a way, that the Martian atmosphere can be simulated with a simultaneous injection of CO 2 and N 2. In addition the performance of the vacuum system has been improved by adding a further <b>roots</b> <b>pump,</b> in order to guarantee a homogeneous hypersonic flow field even during injection of additional noble gas to suppress possible chemical reactions between CO and other species downstream of the test chamber. This measure allows a reliable operation of the facility in terms of the safety of personal and equipment. Comparative tests using the TPS basic material SiC and a cold wall heat flux sensor have been performed in Martian and air atmosphere. In order to achieve the same heat flux rate, i. e. surface temperature, at the same stagnation pressure higher specific enthalpy levels had to be set in the Martian atmosphere compared to air. As shown in Figure 1 a completely different surface temperature development was measured in air and Martian atmosphere at the same gas mass flow rate and reservoir pressure. It is correlated to the differences in the oxidation process of the model surface leading to a different development of the surface properties like catalycity and emissivity. The nozzle flow and the flow field around the model has been computed using CFD codes including chemical and thermal non-equilibrium processes...|$|E

40|$|International audienceGear power {{transmissions}} {{are responsible}} for upsetting vibroacoustic phenomena. The gear teeth compliance, the manufacturing errors and the profile/longitudinal tooth corrections lead to a periodic transmission error fluctuation and a parametric excitation associated to gear mesh stiffness fluctuation.

The induced housing vibration {{is responsible for the}} whining noise radiated from the gearbox. This work is focused on the multiphysics coupling between the gear mesh internal excitation and the external excitation associated with the upstream engine and downstream receiver system. These excitations mix high and low frequency phenomena: the fundamental frequency of internal excitation is the meshing frequency while the fundamental frequencies of the extrenal excitations are the shafts circular frequencies. The coupling between excitations generates an enrichment of the vibratory frequency response. The goal {{of this paper is to}} present the spectral iterative methodology used and the dynamic results induced by this coupling.

30|$|The {{distribution}} of Cd {{in the plant}} tissues (root and Leaf) indicated that 90 % of the Cd was retained in roots and only a small proportion, was translocated to aerial parts. The retention of high amounts of Cd in the roots is a typical response of several plants (Verkleij and Schat [1990]; Mohamed et al. [2012]). This is an important factor, since the differential accumulation of Cd between leaves and roots might explain the lower damage of lipid metabolism in the above ground parts of stressed almond plants. On the other hand, the excess of absorbed metals in <b>roots</b> can be <b>pumped</b> largely into intracellular compartments, resulting to a high metal concentration in the biochemically active compartments.

The second mode cools the first wall to 150 degrees C and the external vessel to 50 degrees C. The system uses a low viscosity heat transfer oil which is capable of high temperature low pressure operation.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the modelling of gear rattle in <b>Roots</b> blower vacuum <b>pumps.</b> Analysis of experimental data reveals that the source of the noise and vibration problem is the backlash nonlinearity due to gear teeth losing and re-establishing contact. We develop nonsmooth ordinary differential equation models for the dynamics of the pump. The models include a time-dependent forcing term which arises from the imperfect, eccentric mounting of the gears. We use a combination of explicit construction, asymptotic methods and numerical techniques to classify complicated dynamic behaviour in realistic parametric regimes. We first present a linear analysis of motions where the gears do not lose contact, and develop upper bounds on eccentricity for quiet operation. We then develop a nonlinear analysis of ‘backlash oscillations’, where the gears lose and re-establish contact, corresponding to noisy pump operation. It is found that noisy solutions can coexist with silent ones, explaining why geared systems can rattle intermittently. We then consider several possible design solutions, and show their implications for pump design in terms of the existence and stability of silent and noisy solutions.

40|$|To grow properly, plants require {{inorganic}} nutrient {{that are}} taken {{up from the}} soil and become incorporated {{into a variety of}} important compounds with structural and physiological roles. Crop production is often limited by low phyto-availability of essential mineral elements and excessive concentrations of potentially toxic mineral elements. Nutrient uptake in the soil is achieved by cation exchange, where <b>root</b> hairs <b>pump</b> hydrogen ions (H+) into the soil through proton pumps. These hydrogen ions displace cations attached to negatively charged soil particles so that the cations are available for uptake by the root. Cross-talk at molecular level between plant nutrients, metabolic pathways and biological processes are not fully understood and transcriptomic analysis could be an effective tool to explain these links in plants whose genome is not already sequenced. In this work, 454 sequencing of Kalanchoe x houghtonii and Arundo donax transcriptomes allow identification of genes putative involved in nutrient uptake and metabolic pathways. Total RNA was isolated from K. x houghtonii leaves (K_L) and A. donax culms (A_C) and roots (A_R) by RNeasy Plant Mini kit (QIAGEN); about 25 ?g of RNA of each group were then prepared for cDNA normalization and library construction by Eurofins MWG Operon. Sequencing, performed on a Genome Sequencer GS FLX Titanium Instrument, generated a total of 593, 130, 825, 369 and 776, 467 raw reads for K_L, A_C and A_R respectively. After trimming of adaptor and low quality base, 454 reads were independently assembled with MIRA for K. x houghtoni and with CLC genomics workbench for A. donax obtaining 138, 816, 164, 248 and 146, 278 unigenes for K_L, A_C and A_R respectively.

40|$|The {{present study}} explores the {{application}} of new materials systems for low threshold microlasers, and characterization of the microcavities. The sol-gel method is used for gain functionalization of high-Q microcavities. A detailed procedure for preparation of the sol-gel films by the spin-on or dip-coating method is presented. The effect of different process conditions on the properties and microstructure of the thin films is investigated through Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), and etching rate test. Surface gain functionalization of microsphere cavities is fabricated by coating the microsphere with {{a thin layer of}} Er 3 +-doped sol-gel films. The optical gain is due to the population inversion of rare earth ions in the sol-gel films. A fiber taper is used to both couple the pump power into and extract the laser power out of the microsphere laser. The laser dynamics change between continuous-wave and pulsating operation by varying the doping concentration and the thickness of the sol-gel films outside the microsphere. Surface functionalization is also achieved on the microtoroid on a single silicon chip, which can be fabricated in parallel using wafer-scale processing and has characteristics that are more easily controlled than microsphere. The microtoroid can be selectively coated only at the periphery by making use of the variation of etching rate (in buffered HF) of sol-gel films with different degrees of densification. The laser performance of the gain functionalized microtoroids is investigated. Highly confined whispering gallery modes make possible single-mode microlasers. This work also shows that the high Q microtoroid laser has a linewidth much lower than 300 kHz. The thesis explores fabrication of high Q microcavities directly from the sol-gel silica films deposited on a single silicon wafer. Quality factor as high as 2. 5 x 10 ^ 7 at 1561 nm is obtained in toroidal microcavities formed of silica sol-gel, which allows Raman lasing at absorbed pump power below 1 mW. Additionally, Er 3 +-doped microlasers are fabricated from Er 3 +-doped sol-gel layers with control of the laser dynamics possible by varying the erbium concentration of the starting sol-gel material. Continuous lasing with a record threshold of 660 nW for erbium-doped microlaser on a silicon wafer is also obtained. Analytic formulas are derived to predict the laser performance, such as the laser output power, the threshold power, and the differential quantum efficiency, under different loading condition, i. e. the air gap between the fiber-taper coupler and the cavities. The effect of Er 3 + concentration on the minimum threshold is also investigated. In addition, we present a theoretical model in which we include paired ions as the saturable absorber. It shows that self-pulsing operation can be expected with paired-ions-induced quenching in the system. The pulsation frequency increases linearly with the square <b>root</b> of the <b>pumping</b> level, which is consistent with the experimental observation...|$|R
