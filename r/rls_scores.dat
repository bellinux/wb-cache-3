40|$|In this {{observational}} cross-sectional study, 49 {{subjects were}} assessed for sleep disorders and for ADHD symptoms. Thirty-six received an ADHD diagnosis (29 : combined type (ADHD-C); 7 : inattentive type). An RLS and RLS symptoms prevalence of 34. 5 % was found, {{with a higher}} prevalence rate in the ADHD-C subgroup, although not significantly (p = 0. 066). RLS symptoms were correlated with particularly hyperactivity-impulsivity (= 0. 742; p: 0. 000). ADHD patients with positive <b>RLS</b> <b>scores</b> reported {{higher scores on the}} ADHD-Rating scale compared with patients with negative <b>RLS</b> <b>scores</b> (Z: - 2. 968, p = 0. 003), mainly due to higher hyperactivity-impulsivity scores (Z: - 3. 145; p = 0. 002). Our findings show that clinicians {{need to be aware of}} RLS among adult ADHD patients, particularly those with severe hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} tool to assess the team {{leadership}} skills of internal medicine residents. Method: A 27 -item pilot instrument developed by two authors was distributed to interns on ward and intensive care unit teams {{at the end of}} rotations from a single institution’s internal medicine res-idency program. These items were factor analyzed and reduced to a seven-item resident leadership scale (RLS). Validity of the instrument was assessed by comparing the rating on the RLS to scores on a validated measure of teaching skills provided {{at the same time and}} by the program director’s global rating of team leadership skill for each resident at the completion of data collection. Results: The three principal components from the factor analysis explained 82 percent of the vari-ance. By introspection we reduced the scale to the final 7 -item RLS that had a Cronbach alpha reliability estimate of 0. 95. 490 ratings on 134 individual residents were available for analysis. The <b>RLS</b> <b>scores</b> correlated highly with both the validated measure of teaching skill and the program director’s ratings. Conclusion: The RLS has robust psychometric properties. It may provide a useful tool for a broader assessment of trainee skill if validated in other settings...|$|E
40|$|Background: Restless leg {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{a common}} problem in patients with chronic renal failure. It can reduce {{the quality of life}} and sleep disturbances. This disorder is usually treated pharmacologically. Recently, complementary medicine methods have been suggested because of chemical drugs adverse effects. There is not enough evidence about the effect of aromatherapy on RLS. Objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effects of massage with lavender oil on RLS symptoms in hemodialysis patients. Patients and Methods: This randomized clinical trial study included 70 hemodialysis patients with RLS that were randomly assigned into two groups in 2014. The experimental group received effleurage massage using lavender oil and control group received routine care for three weeks. Data was collected with RLS questionnaire and analyzed using independent and paired t-test and Chi-square test. Results: The mean <b>RLS</b> <b>scores</b> were not significantly different in the two groups at the start of study (22. 41 ± 7. 67 vs. 22. 90 ± 4. 38, P = 0. 76). At the end of study, the mean RLS score significantly decreased in the intervention group, while this score remained relatively un-changed in the control group (12. 41 ± 5. 49 vs. 23. 23 ± 4. 52, P < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Lavender oil massage was effective to improve RLS in hemodialysis patients. It has no adverse effects, is practical and cost-effective. It is suggested to be used along with routine treatment of RLS in hemodialysis patients...|$|E

2500|$|Ainscough's first {{experience}} of competitive rugby league football came through Wigan St Judes ARLFC. He {{remained at the}} amateur club until 2006, when he gained a scholarship to join the academy of his hometown professional club, Wigan. His first game for the academy came in a Junior Academy Championship fixture at Hilton Park against Leigh, playing at wing. Ainscough marked this appearance by also scoring his first try in a Wigan jersey. He was rotated into different positions throughout his academy career, playing at centre for a repeat match against Leigh seven weeks later, as well as fullback against [...] the game after that. On both occasions, Ainscough scored tries, earning one and two tries in each game respectively. However, his first competitive hat-trick came playing on the left wing in a play-off game against Widnes. During his time with the academy in 2007, Ainscough also played two matches at senior level, once against Hull, and once against Harlequins <b>RL,</b> <b>scoring</b> a try in the latter fixture.|$|R
5000|$|Despite this, Thomas Leuluai {{replaced}} Tomkins for the team's next {{match against}} Warrington, meaning Tomkins {{would have to}} wait for his Super League debut. He played {{out the rest of the}} 2008 season in the reserves, some of his highlights including a hat-trick against Castleford and another five-try performance against Harlequins <b>RL.</b> After <b>scoring</b> four tries against Hull's reserves, Tomkins was tipped to make at least ten Super League appearances in 2009 season by Shaun Wane, Wigan's reserve coach. He also received an endorsement from Ian Lenagan, the club's chairman, when he said, [...] "I think Sam is going to be a world-class half-back and we want to give him his chance." [...] Tomkins was named Reserve Team Player of the Year at the Wigan inaugural awards evening.|$|R
5000|$|Armstrong's début {{game for}} Saints came against Warrington {{in the first}} round of Super League XIV. Standing in for New Zealand {{international}} Francis Meli, he scored a try in a 26-14 win. He went on from this to play against Huddersfield in the next round, Hull Kingston Rovers [...] and a try scoring performance in a 4-0 win over Crusaders (he was the only player to score in this game) [...] After a period in the reserves, he came back to play in the win over Harlequins <b>RL</b> where he <b>scored</b> a try in a 44-24 victory.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{clinical}} studies showed increased postoperative pain intensity and cumulative morphine consumption following intraoperative high dose remifentanil. In {{this study we}} investigated in patients undergoing lower abdominal surgery i) whether postoperative pain and analgesic consumption is increased following intraoperative high versus low dose remifentanil, and ii) whether this is prevented by preoperative administration of the NMDA antagonist amantadine. 48 adult patients undergoing major abdominal surgery {{were randomly assigned to}} three anaesthetic regims: group RL recieved a continuous remifentanil infusion 0, 1 µg/kg/min and sevoflurane titrated to autonomic responses; group RH recieved a continuous inspiratory concentration of sevoflurane (0, 5 MAC) and a remifentanil infusion titrated to autonomic responses; group RHA recieved the same anaesthetic plan as RH and preoperatively 200 mg amantadine iv. Patients who were blinded to group assignment controlled their own morphine administration via PCIA. Pain scores and morphine consumption were recorded to the sixth hour on PCIA by a also blinded study observer. Results: The mean remifentanil infusion rate was RH 0, 20 ± 0, 01 and RHA 0, 22 ± 0, 01 µg/kg/min, which were significantly greater than in group <b>RL.</b> Postoperative pain <b>scores</b> were not significantly different between the groups. All patients required morphine in the same amount: 30, 7 ± 4, 1 (RL), 28, 9 ± 5, 2 (RH) and 30, 6 ± 2, 0 mg (RHA). Relative large-dose intraoperative remifentanil did not increase postoperative pain and morphine consumption. Also, preoperative amandatin administration did not attenuate the postoperative response. These data suggests that remifentanil does not cause a clinical relevant hyperalgesia mediated by NMDA-receptors...|$|R
