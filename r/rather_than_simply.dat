5|$|In 2006, Vargas Llosa wrote The Bad Girl (Travesuras de la niña mala), which {{journalist}} Kathryn Harrison argues is a rewrite (<b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> a recycling) of Gustave Flaubert's Madame Bovary (1856). In Vargas Llosa's version, {{the plot}} relates the decades-long obsession of its narrator, a Peruvian expatriate in Paris, {{with a woman}} with whom he first fell in love when both were teenagers.|$|E
5|$|Morales had {{not taken}} {{a leading role in}} these protests, but did use them to get across his message that the MAS was not a single-issue party, and that <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> {{fighting}} for the rights of the cocalero it was arguing for structural change to the political system and a redefinition of citizenship in Bolivia.|$|E
5|$|The American {{historian}} Gary Clayton Anderson of the University of Oklahoma published Sitting Bull and the Paradox of Lakota Nationhood (2010), a revisionist {{examination of}} the Lakota medicine man. Anderson stresses the Little Big Horn in light of past successes of the Lakota Nation and the merits of Sitting Bull himself, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> a mishap by Custer.|$|E

5|$|There {{are also}} {{paintings}} on {{the north and south}} walls depicting the Camoys family. Camoys was the lord of the manor and it appears he had the church built primarily for his family. This would explain the unusual detail in the paintings. They were intended as rich decoration <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> for educating an illiterate congregation.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{influenced}} by Marxist frameworks for analysing society, for instance in developing the belief that British colonialism had to be destroyed <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> reformed. However, he disagreed with the Marxist attitude that tribalism was backward and retrograde; his positive attitude toward tribal society frustrated some of Kenyatta's Marxist Pan-Africanist friends in Britain, among them Padmore, James, and Ras T. Makonnen, who regarded it as parochial and un-progressive. He appears to have had no further involvement with the communist movement after 1934.|$|E
5|$|In the off-season, Ottawa's {{president}} Llewellyn Bate {{proposed to}} suspend the team's operations {{until the end of}} the war. Gate receipts had declined 17 per cent. The other NHA owners refused {{to suspend the}} league. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> cease operations, Bate and the other directors of the team turned it over to Ted Dey, owner of the Arena. Dey cut player salaries and let players go, including Art Ross to the Wanderers. Dey also fired manager Alf Smith, saving on his $750 salary.|$|E

5|$|Life's Shop Window was {{the first}} film produced, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> distributed, by William Fox's Box Office Attractions Company, the {{corporate}} predecessor to Fox Film. Several reviewers approved of the film's expurgated treatment of the novel's plot, although opinions {{of the quality of}} the film itself were mixed. It proved very popular upon its initial release in New York, and that success was used to advertise the film elsewhere. Like many of Fox's early works, it was likely lost in the 1937 Fox vault fire.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> {{quell the}} mutiny however, Germanicus rallied the mutineers {{and led them}} on a short {{campaign}} across the Rhine into Germanic territory, stating that whatever treasure they could grab would count as their bonus. Germanicus's forces crossed the Rhine and quickly occupied all of the territory between the Rhine and the Elbe. Additionally, Tacitus records the capture of the Teutoburg forest and the reclaiming of Roman standards lost years before by Publius Quinctilius Varus, when three Roman legions and its auxiliary cohorts had been ambushed by Germanic tribes.|$|E
5|$|The other {{significant}} {{difference is that}} the Lutheran calendar commemorates a wider variety of individuals than does either of its counterparts. Included on the calendar are musicians and artists who are associated with the Church, but are not typically thought of as “saints” in the classical sense. The intent is to provide a wider venue for commemoration of outstanding individuals who have served the Church through their vocations <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> commemorating the outstanding among the religious.|$|E
50|$|In March 1980, the multiple-key reboot concept {{had been}} {{introduced}} for the Apple II by Videx in its VideoTerm display card add-on, requiring Control-Reset, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> just <b>simply</b> Reset, to reboot the machine. The innovation was noted and well received at the time.|$|R

5|$|The {{technique}} of building lightweight domes with interlocking hollow ceramic tubes further developed in North Africa and Italy {{in the late}} 3rd and early 4th centuries. By the 4th century, the thin and lightweight tubed vaulting had become a vaulting technique in its own right, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> serving as a permanent centering for concrete. It was used in early Christian buildings in Italy. Arranging these terracotta tubes in a continuous spiral created a dome that was not strong enough for very large spans, but required only minimal centering and formwork. The later dome of the Baptistry of Neon in Ravenna is an example.|$|E
5|$|While Shay was {{managing}} at Kansas City in early 1910, American Association president Thomas Chivington imposed new conduct {{rules for the}} league. The new system emphasized fines for players and managers <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> ejecting them when they behaved poorly. After Shay was ejected from three games in a four-game span, a Minnesota newspaper article questioned whether his behavior {{would be subject to}} additional disciplinary action. The next month, Shay released 48-year-old Jake Beckley, prompting his retirement after one of the longest careers in professional baseball history. The first baseman had tried to make the Kansas City team after 20 years in the National League.|$|E
5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio backwards. David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines backwards, Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements backwards, as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|E

5|$|In a {{retrospective}} interview, Rare designers Jens Restemeier and Nick Burton took interest in the-then upcoming Xbox Live Arcade {{and offered to}} develop a new game for the service after the release of Rare's Xbox 360 launch titles Perfect Dark Zero and Kameo. <b>Rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> porting the original ZX Spectrum title to the Xbox 360, the development team decided to expand Jetpac and experiment with new elements. The team ensured to keep the original core mechanics of the Jetpac whilst designing new features for the game. Restemeier also stated that the development process for an Xbox Live Arcade game differed from a retail title, owing to processing power limitations that had to be constantly synced over Xbox Live. Burton asserted that one of the differences with development on the Xbox Live Service was the way optimisations shifted from graphics and game logic, stating that this was more difficult {{than it would have been}} for an Xbox 360 title such as Kameo.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} war strategy, Lincoln {{articulated}} two priorities: {{to ensure that}} Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force {{him to take a}} carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. Lincoln learned from reading the theoretical book of his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a disciple of the European strategist Jomini; he began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River. Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> capturing territory.|$|E
5|$|Transport {{infrastructure}} {{to the region}} began to improve throughout the 19th century, adding to the flow of visitors to the sites, including the future Queen Victoria in 1832. Academic research into the sites, particularly Caernarfon and Conwy, began {{to occur in the}} middle of the 19th century. Local and central government interest began to increase. In 1865 Conwy Castle passed to the civic leadership of Conwy town who began restoration work on the ruins, including the reconstruction of the slighted Bakehouse tower. From the 1870s onwards, the government funded repairs to Caernarfon Castle. The deputy-constable, Llewellyn Turner, oversaw the work, controversially restoring and rebuilding the castle, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> conserving the existing stonework. Despite the protests of local residents, the moat to the north of the castle was cleared of post-medieval buildings that were considered to spoil the view.|$|E
50|$|RCA {{is applied}} to methodically {{identify}} and correct {{the root causes of}} events, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> to <b>simply</b> address the symptomatic result. Focusing correction on root causes has the goal of entirely preventing problem recurrence. Conversely, RCFA (Root Cause Failure Analysis) recognizes that complete prevention of recurrence by one corrective action is not always possible.|$|R

5|$|Another {{criticism}} of Kohlberg’s {{theory is that}} people frequently demonstrate significant inconsistency in their moral judgements. This often occurs in moral dilemmas involving drinking and driving and business situations where participants {{have been shown to}} reason at a subpar stage, typically using more self-interest driven reasoning (i.e., stage two) than authority and social order obedience driven reasoning (i.e., stage four). Kohlberg’s theory is generally considered to be incompatible with inconsistencies in moral reasoning. Carpendale has argued that Kohlberg’s theory should be modified to focus on the view that the process of moral reasoning involves integrating varying perspectives of a moral dilemma <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> fixating on applying rules. This view would allow for inconsistency in moral reasoning since individuals may be hampered by their inability to consider different perspectives. Krebs and Denton have also attempted to modify Kohlberg’s theory to account for a multitude of conflicting findings, but eventually concluded that the theory is not equipped to take into consideration how most individuals make moral decisions in their everyday lives.|$|E
5|$|At the school, Crawford was {{influenced}} by his housemaster, F. B. Malim, {{who presided over the}} archaeological section of the college's Natural History Society and encouraged the boy's interest in the subject. It is possible that Malim provided something of a father figure for the young Crawford. With the society, Crawford visited such archaeological sites as Stonehenge, West Kennet Long Barrow, Avebury, and Martinsell. It was also through the society that he obtained Ordnance Survey maps of the landscape, allowing him to explore the downs near to his aunts' home. He began excavation of a barrow near to Bull's Copse, thus attracting the attention of the antiquarian Harold Peake, who was then involved in compiling the Victoria County History of Berkshire. Peake and his wife lived a Bohemian lifestyle, being vegetarians and social reformers, and their ideas had a strong impact on Crawford. Under the Peakes' influence, Crawford rejected his religious upbringing in favour of a rationalist world-view based in science. Crawford gained an appreciation from Peake for the understanding of past societies through an examination of the geographical landscape <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> through texts or artefacts.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 2007 season, Beckett {{adjusted}} to throwing more breaking pitches and fewer fastballs. At the same time, he learned to locate his pitches <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>simply</b> get strikes by power. He reduced his walks and home runs allowed by nearly half, contributing to his success in 2007. Beckett became one of six Red Sox pitchers in history to win their first seven starts. George Winter and Mickey Harris both won their first seven starts in a season, and Babe Ruth, Dave Ferriss and Roger Moret all won their first eight starts in a season. After a strong first half, posting a 12–2 record with a 3.44 ERA, he was selected to the American League team in the 2007 MLB All-Star Game. Beckett earned the victory in the game after pitching two innings, giving up only one hit, and striking out two. Beckett became the first pitcher to win 20 games in a season since 2005, finishing the season with a record of 20–7, a 3.27 ERA, 194 strikeouts, a 1.14 WHIP, and only 40 walks and 17 home runs allowed.|$|E
