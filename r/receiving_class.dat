40|$|SummaryBackgroundAtrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) {{and heart}} failure (HF) {{are associated with}} significant mortality and morbidity. We sometimes encounter patients who have AF upon admission to the hospital, but it spontaneously converts to sinus rhythm within several days (i. e. converter). PurposeWe examined the association between the outcome and types of strategy for AF treatment in converters. MethodsFrom January 2000 to December 2005, we identified 95 converters (age 69 ± 12 years) presenting with worsening HF and AF upon admission, in which sinus rhythm was restored within 7 days without either electrical or pharmacological cardioversion. The patients were classified into three groups according to the antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy used: class I AAD, class III AAD, and rate-control drug. The patients were followed for 36 ± 23 months. ResultsThe left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) significantly improved with conversion to sinus rhythm (38 ± 14 % vs. 47 ± 13 %, p< 0. 05). Those <b>receiving</b> <b>class</b> I AAD had a trend toward a well-preserved LVEF (50 ± 13 %, n= 35) as compared to those <b>receiving</b> <b>class</b> III AAD (43 ± 12 %, n= 24) or rate-control drug (47 ± 14 %, n= 36). In the patients <b>receiving</b> <b>class</b> I AAD, the rate of all-cause death increased 1. 9 -fold (p= 0. 009) compared to those <b>receiving</b> <b>class</b> III AAD, and 1. 7 -fold (p= 0. 010) compared to those taking rate-control drug. A hospitalization for HF was observed in 49 (52 %) patients, however {{there was no significant}} difference in the rate of hospitalization among the three groups (p= 0. 890). Those receiving rate-control drugs had a 50 % lower rate of the development of persistent AF than those taking class III AAD (p= 0. 019). ConclusionsA rate-control strategy should be the primary approach for converters to reduce mortality and development of persistent AF...|$|E
40|$|Embryo {{survival}} rates obtained after transfer of in vitro produced porcine blastocysts are very poor. This is probably related to poor {{quality of the}} embryos. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine markers for good quality blastocysts. Therefore, we tried to link blastocyst morphology to several morphological and cell biological properties, and evaluated the survival of in vitro produced, morphologically classified, blastocysts following non-surgical transfer. In vitro and in vivo produced blastocysts were allocated to two groups (classes A and B) on the basis of morphological characteristics. The quality of their actin cytoskeleton, their total cell number, their ability to re-expand after cytochalasin-B treatment and the occurrence of numerical chromosome aberrations were studied and compared. In vivo produced blastocysts were used as a control. Our results indicate that the ability of blastocysts to re-expand after cytochalasin-B-induced actin depolymerization was positively correlated with the morphology of the blastocyst, and associated with the quality of the actin cytoskeleton. Chromosome analysis revealed that mosaicism is inherent to the in vitro production of porcine embryos, but also that in vivo produced blastocysts contained some non-diploid cells. In non-surgical embryo transfer experiments more recipients <b>receiving</b> <b>class</b> A blastocysts were pregnant on Day 20 than those <b>receiving</b> <b>class</b> B blastocysts.

40|$|A high {{percentage}} of patients having atrial fibrillation (AF) presents with paroxysmal AF. Flecainide, the prototypic class Ic anti-arrhythmic drug {{is the most effective}} drug to maintain sinus rhythm in this subgroup of patients, though the drug has potential pro-arrhythmic effects. Furthermore, the H 1 receptor antagonists are the most commonly prescribed drugs for the symptomatic treatment of pruritus. Despite having low number of adverse effects, the H 1 receptor antagonists have cardiotoxic effects. Flecainide and H 1 receptor antagonists present arrhythmic complications including QT interval prolongation and torsade de pointes (TdP). The case presented here is a 65 -year-old female who was diagnosed of atrial fibrillation and presented with rashes in lower extremities. The patient was treated using flecainide and H 1 receptor antagonists (loratadine and hydroxyzine) that prolonged QT interval and induced TdP. The concomitant administration of flecainide and H 1 receptor antagonists seems to have a synergistic effect in QT interval prolongation and subsequent TdP. The concurrent administration of H 1 receptor antagonists to patients <b>receiving</b> <b>class</b> Ic anti-arrhythmic drugs should be avoided in order to reduce arrhythmic risk in this population...|$|E
40|$|Purpose Selective {{inhibition}} of mutant BRAF by using class I RAF inhibitors {{in patients with}} metastatic melanoma has resulted in impressive clinical activity. However, {{there is also evidence}} that RAF inhibitors might induce carcinogenesis or promote tumor progression via stimulation of MAPK signaling in RAF wild-type cells. We analyzed melanocytic lesions arising under class I RAF inhibitor treatment for dignity, specific genetic mutations, or expression of signal transduction molecules. Patients and Methods In all, 22 cutaneous melanocytic lesions that had either developed or considerably changed in morphology in 19 patients undergoing treatment with selective BRAF inhibitors for BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma at seven international melanoma centers within clinical trials in 2010 and 2011 were analyzed for mutations in BRAF and NRAS genes and immunohistologically assessed for expression of various signal transduction molecules in comparison with 22 common nevi of 21 patients with no history of BRAF inhibitor treatment. Results Twelve newly detected primary melanomas were confirmed in 11 patients within 27 weeks of selective BRAF blockade. In addition, 10 nevi developed of which nine were dysplastic. All melanocytic lesions were BRAF wild type. Explorations revealed that expression of cyclin D 1 and pAKT was increased in newly developed primary melanomas compared with nevi (P =. 01 and P =. 03, respectively). There was no NRAS mutation in common nevi, but BRAF mutations were frequent. Conclusion Malignant melanocytic tumors might develop with increased frequency in patients treated with selective BRAF inhibitors supporting a mechanism of BRAF therapy–induced growth and tumorigenesis. Careful surveillance of melanocytic lesions in patients <b>receiving</b> <b>class</b> I RAF inhibitors seems warranted...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} assess the {{efficacy}} and safety of ibutilide cardioversion for those with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) receiving long-term treatmentwith class IC agents. BackgroundAttenuation of ibutilide-induced QT prolongation has been observed in {{a small number of}} patients pretreated with class IC agents. The clinical significance of the interaction between ibutilide and class IC agents is unknown. MethodsSeventy-one patients with AF (n = 48) or AFL (n = 23), receiving propafenone 300 to 900 mg/day (n = 46) or flecainide 100 to 300 mg/day (n = 25), presented for ibutilide (2. 0 mg) cardioversion. ResultsThe mean durations of arrhythmia episode and arrhythmia history were 25 ± 48 days and 4. 4 ± 6. 4 years, respectively. Sixty-five patients (91. 5 %) had normal left ventricular systolic function. Twenty-three of 48 patients (47. 9 %; 95 % confidence interval, 33. 3 % to 62. 8 %) with AF and 17 of 23 patients (73. 9 %; 95 % confidence interval, 51. 6 % to 89. 8 %) with AFL converted with mean conversion times of 25 ± 14 min and 20 ± 12 min, respectively. There was a small increase in corrected QT interval after ibutilide (from 442 ± 61 ms to 462 ± 59 ms, p = 0. 006). One patient developed non-sustained polymorphous ventricular tachycardia and responded to intravenous magnesium. Another developed sustained torsade de pointes and was treated effectively with direct-current shock and intravenous dopamine. ConclusionsOur observations suggest that the use of ibutilide in patients <b>receiving</b> <b>class</b> IC agents is as successful in restoring sinus rhythm and has a similar incidence of adverse effects as the use of ibutilide alone...|$|E

40|$|Aims. The {{purpose of}} this study was to eval-uate the {{clinical}} outcome in patients with recur-rent atrial fibrillation (AF) and drug-related typical atrial flutter (AFL) undergoing cavotri-cuspid isthmus ablation. Methods. The study population consisted of 53 consecutive patients (36 men, 17 women, mean age 61 ± 11 years) with recurrent AF (paroxys-mal 62 %, persistent 21 %, paroxysmal and per-sistent 17 %) and typical AFL while <b>receiving</b> <b>class</b> IC (79 %) or class III (21 %) antiarrhythmic drugs. All the patients underwent successful cavotricuspid isthmus ablation and continued the preexisting antiarrhythmic drug treatment. Results. Within the first month after the pro-cedure, AFL recurred in 4 patients who were successfully re-ablated. During a mean follow-up of 14 ± 9 months, AF recurred in 29 patients (55 %), paroxysmal in 26, and persistent in 3. In these patients, however, the incidence (23 ± 44 episodes per year before ablation vs 6 ± 5 episodes per year after ablation, respectively, p = 0. 02) was significantly lower compared to the year pre-ceding the ablation. Moreover, compared with the pre-ablation period, fewer patients needed hos-pitalization for arrhythmic problems (50 vs 12 %, p = 0. 001) and electrical cardioversion (28 vs 2 %, p = 0. 001). Overall, 88 % of the patients had an improvement in quality of life, 10 % no change, and 2 % had a worsening. One patient had a fatal stroke. Conclusions. In patients with recurrent AF and typical AFL related to class IC and III antiar-rhythmic drugs, cavotricuspid isthmus ablation and continuation of drug treatment eliminate AFL and reduce AF recurrences. As a conse-quence, a clinical benefit is observed...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} {{establishment}} of the music curriculum in state-supported schools in South Australia from the beginnings of such schooling until 1920. There will be a discussion of issues to be explored and the method by which this investigation will proceed. A literature survey of relevant research will be included, after which there will be a sketch of the development of state-supported schooling in South Australia. Several broad themes have been chosen as the means of organising the historical material: the rationales offered for the inclusion of music in schooling, the methodologies, syllabi and materials of such music instruction, the provisions for teacher training in music, both preservice and as professional development for established teachers, and the place and function of music in schooling. Each of these themes will form the framework for a chronological narrative. Comparisons will be made with three neighbouring colonies/States concerning each of these themes and conclusions will be drawn. Finally, overall conclusions will be made concerning the initial contentions raised in this chapter {{in the light of the}} data presented. Although this study is principally concerned with the establishment of music in state-supported schooling, there will be a brief consideration of the colony of South Australia from its proclamation in 1836. The music pedagogical context that prevailed at that time will be discussed and this will, of necessity, include developments that occurred before 1836. The period under consideration will close in 1920, by which time the music curriculum for South Australia was established, and the second of the influential figures in music education was at his zenith. At this time there was a new school curriculum in place which remained essentially unchanged for several decades. As well as the broad themes identified, this thesis will investigate several contentions as it attempts to chronicle and interpret the establishment and development of music in state-supported schooling in South Australia up to 1920. The first contention of this thesis is that music in state-supported schooling, once established, did not change significantly from its inception throughout the period under consideration. In seeking a discussion of the existence and importance of the notion of an absence of change or stasis, the theory of punctuated equilibria, which identifies stasis as the norm in the evolutionary growth of species, will be employed as an insightful analogy. It should be recognised that stasis exists, should be expected and may well be the prevailing norm. The second contention of this thesis is that advocates were and continue to be crucial to the establishment and continued existence of music in state-supported schooling. For change to occur there must be pressure through such agencies as motivated individuals holding positions of authority, and thus able to influence the educational system and its provisions. The pedagogical method introduced into an educational system is often that espoused by the acknowledged advocate. During the period under consideration there were two significant advocates for music in state-supported schools. The third contention of this thesis is that music was used in South Australia, as in the other colonies/States, as an agent of social reform, through the selection of repertoire and the way in which music was employed in state-supported schooling. Music was considered inherently uplifting. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the music selected for school singing carried texts with messages deemed significant by those who controlled the education system. The repertoire was not that of the <b>receiving</b> <b>class</b> but came from a middle class tradition of fully notated art music in which correct performance and notational reading were emphasised. A sweet, pure vocal tone was desired, as strident, harsh, speaking tones were perceived as a symptom of incipient larrikinism which was not desired in schooling. Music was seen as a contributor to good order and discipline in schooling...|$|E
40|$|Os avanços tecnológicos dos últimos anos exigem novas posturas nos ambientes de ensino de modo a diminuir as distâncias entre o cotidiano dos estudantes e o dia-a-dia na sala de aula. O presente projeto teve por objetivo o desenvolvimento de uma {{interface}} adaptativa (IA), de modo a atender essa necessidade presente, estimulando os alunos ao estudo e facilitando o processo de ensino aprendizagem. O espaço virtual desenvolvido neste caso foi um site. Foram construídas três abas destinadas a três grupos de usuário: Básico (Ensino Fundamental), Médio (Ensino Médio) e Avançado (Ensino Superior). Todas as abas da IA tratam do tema "proliferação celular", no entanto, foram utilizados recursos e linguagem adaptados a cada nível. Para avaliação do recurso, o site foi aplicado para estudantes do ensino fundamental de escolas adventistas (4 classes - 117 alunos), do ensino médio do Colégio COTUCA (4 classes - 131 alunos) e do ensino superior para o curso de Ciências Biológicas da Unicamp (2 classes - 95 alunos). Todos os grupos foram divididos randomicamente em: experimental (recebe a aula com a IA) e controle (aula convencional sobre o mesmo assunto). Vale ressaltar que os estudantes do grupo controle também tiveram aula com a IA, após a avaliação da mesma. Antes da aplicação da IA, os estudantes responderam a um pré-teste para verificar os conhecimentos prévios e analisar a homogeneidade entre as turmas. Após a aplicação da aula com e sem a interface, todos os estudantes responderam a um pós-teste e construíram um mapa conceitual. Além destes instrumentos, as avaliações formais da disciplina também foram utilizadas para verificar a eficácia da IA. Entrevistas foram realizadas com os estudantes e uma carta avaliativa solicitada aos professores. Aplicando ANOVA (one way) aos resultados dos pré-testes, foi possível verificar que não houve diferença significativa entre as turmas do ensino médio (p= 0. 49), do ensino fundamental (p= 0. 92) e do ensino superior (p= 0. 09). Quando comparados os pós-testes, percebeu-se diferença significativa entre os grupos controle e experimental de todos os níveis (p. Three tabs {{were built}} for three user groups: Basic (Elementary School), Medium (High School) and Advanced (College). All AI tabs {{had the same}} subject, cell proliferation. However, adapted resources and language were used for each model. For evaluation of the resource developed, the site was used with elementary school students from Adventist Schools (4 classes - 117 students), high school students from COTUCA school (4 classes - 131 students) and Higher Education students of the Biological Sciences course from Unicamp (2 classes - 95 students). All groups were randomly divided into experimental (<b>receiving</b> <b>class</b> with AI) and control groups (conventional lecture of the same subject). It is important to stress that students {{in the control group}} also had class with the AI, but only after the evaluation. Before the implementation of the AI, students answered a pre-test to verify the previous knowledge and examine whether there were differences between the groups. After applying the lesson, with and without the interface, all students answered a post-test and built a conceptual map. In addition to these instruments, formal evaluations of the course were also used to verify the effectiveness of the AI. Interviews were conducted with students and an evaluation letter was requested to the teachers. Applying ANOVA (one way) to the results of the pre-tests, we found that {{there was no significant difference}} between the high school (p = 0. 49), the basic education (p = 0. 92) and the college groups (p = 0. 09). Comparing the post-test results, we noticed a significant difference between the control and experimental groups at all levels (p < 0. 05), demonstrating that students who had classes with the interface did get better grades. When evaluating the conceptual maps, we found that maps from the control groups had a higher degree of generality, ie, are less specific and contain less concepts in comparison with the experimental groups maps. There was also a smaller amount of connective propositions on the maps from the control groups, reducing the number of inter-linkages in the structure. The evaluation letters by the teachers showed approval and interest to apply the AI in other opportunities. Thus, we conclude that this suggestion of innovating the classes and the methodology currently applied, using the AI, besides of encouraging the students to study in a more active and participative way, it motivated the teachers, and therefore facilitated the teaching-learning process in both directions...|$|E

40|$|South Africa is {{a country}} with very little prime farmland. A large {{percentage}} of this high agricultural capability land is generally acidic and nutrient poor, and situated in areas where large coal mining activities occur. Coal mining and agriculture are important industries in South Africa. They impact extensive land areas, and often compete for the same land. The surface mining of coal seriously damages the surface soil, local flora and fauna. Mining wastes viz. overburden, discards and mine effluents, have also created land degradation problems. Three {{of the most common}} factors that characterize degraded substrates are soil acidification, nutrient depletion and loss of biological activity. To ensure a healthy and productive vegetation, disturbed soils need to be ameliorated effectively. Using conventional methods is costly and is often not sustainable. The challenge is, therefore, to use potential alternative ameliorants in an economically, ecologically and socially sustainable manner. Fortunately, South Africa has plenty of industrial and organic by-products, which might be used as alternative ameliorants. There is an enormous amount of international literature on the use of class C fly ash, (Sub bitumious or lignite CCB – [Coal combustion byproduct]), {{and to a lesser extent}} class F fly ash (Bitumious CCB), as opposed to South African class F fly ash, which is predominantly produced in this country. Fly ash, either by itself, or together with other wastes such as biosolids, can serve as a soil ameliorant by providing a good source of micro-, macronutrients and organic material for the reclamation of land. Previous research has shown that when sewage sludge is mixed with class F fly ash and a suitable source of reactive lime in a specific ratio, sewage sludge pasteurization will occur. The SLudgeASH (SLASH) mixture has been extensively evaluated as a soil ameliorant and has proven to be viable for the reclamation of poor and marginal soils. This study, has focused on the effect of soil ameliorants on the chemical-, physical- and microbiological properties of degraded agricultural land, mine land and other mining wastes (tailings and discards) requiring rehabilitation. This study also evaluated the affects of class F fly ash and SLASH amelioration of soils and substrates on plant production and revegetation, in comparison with conventional liming and fertilization methods currently in use. Species such as maize (Zea mays) and wheat (Triticum aestivum); pasture legumes such as lucerne or alfalfa (Medicago sativa); sub tropical grasses such as Foxtail Buffalo grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), Rhodegrass (Chloris gayana) and Smutsfinger grass (Digitaria erianthra) have been evaluated. The success of enhanced plant production, re- vegetation and sustainability of once degraded soils / substrates is an indication of the amelioration success achieved. Seed germination, root development, plant yield, plant density, botanical diversity and biological activity are parameters which can all be used to support the conclusion that alternative substrate amendment practices can improve the plant growth medium. Based on the results obtained in this study, it was concluded that fly ash and fly ash/organic material mixtures (SLASH) improved soil chemical properties such as pH, ammonium acetate extractable K, Ca, Mg and Bray 1 extractable P levels. All parameters measured were significantly influenced by the fly ash and SLASH. For example, the pH of soils impacted by acid mine drainage was improved by 240 % by the use of SLASH. Other results illustrate improvements in soil physical properties such as texture, bulk density, water infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity, by class F fly ash based soil ameliorants. In addition to the beneficial effects on soil physical properties, the microbial properties were also improved, as indicated by the beneficiation of symbiotic relationship of the Rhizobium bacteria and the important host plant Medicago sativa. Improvements in crop yields, such as: wheat yields on SLASH and fly ash treatments were 270 % and 150 % better than the control respectively; yields of maize and alfalfa were improved by 130 % and 450 % respectively, were also registered. Fly ash and SLASH ameliorated soils resulted in approximately 850 %, 266 % and 110 % higher dry matter production on gold mine tailings, AMD impacted soil and acidic mine cover soil, respectively, relative to the control treatments. Results also clearly illustrated that the abundance of certain species can be related to the higher fertility levels of the rehabilitated soil. Data collected over the past seven years, illustrates how the botanical composition has changed, and that soils <b>receiving</b> <b>class</b> F fly ash and sewage sludge had a higher dry matter production, whereas the control (no treatment) had a better biodiversity. With respect to the reclamation of coal discard materials, significant increases in yield, of up to 200 %, were noted for soils and discards treated with class F fly ash, relative to the untreated control. The pH of cover soil was the most strongly affected soil parameter during the experimental period. Class F fly ash and SLASH have the potential to improve the chemical, physical and microbiological properties of degraded soils and substrates. From this experimental work it can be concluded that class F fly ash from Lethabo definitely has a much higher CaCO 3 equivalent than what was originally assumed and that other SA sources probably have an even better neutralizing value. Class F fly ash and SLASH, are good sources of micronutrients and some macro nutrients, and may play a significant role in neutralizing acidity due to their residual alkalinity, and thus ability to continuously change the soil chemical balance so that nutrients become more available for plant uptake and use, thereby enhancing growth. Agricultural, domestic and industrial byproducts unfortunately, vary greatly in nutrient content, trace metals and liming potential, and these factors can affect both re-vegetation success and the environmental impact of reclamation. Co-utilization of by-products can often combine beneficial properties of the individual by-products to eventually have a more pronounced effect on the degraded soil or substrate.

40|$|More than 50 % of {{wastewater}} biosolids {{are applied}} to agricultural fields as fertilizer in the U. S. This technique {{has been used for}} decades as a widely accepted beneficial reclamation method for biosolids, which meet the established regulatory levels for nutrients, metals, and pathogens. A major drawback to land application is the potential environmental release of non-regulated organic contaminants, which accumulate in biosolids during the wastewater treatment process. Recent studies have been performed to identify and quantify the presence of emerging contaminants in biosolids, and others have investigated the effects of compounds already identified as `priority pollutants' and whose use is waning. However, there is limited research on the effect of emerging organic contaminants on soil microbial ecology and nutrient cycling. Because many of the compounds found in biosolids are specifically designed to elicit biological modifications (e. g., antimicrobials), there is a risk that these compounds will disrupt microbial soil functions, decrease soil productivity, and ultimately affect the long term viability of these ecosystems, resulting in unforeseen economic and social costs. Therefore, there is a clear need to characterize the effects of novel contaminants on soil health. This dissertation was divided into three distinct parts examining the impacts of emerging organic contaminants on soil microbial ecology with increasing complexity to better reflect environmental conditions. To assess the ecological impacts, the functional endpoint of denitrification was selected because it provides a vital indication of soil health. Denitrifying bacteria {{play a critical role in}} this process, and thus, were used as indicator organisms for determining contaminant ecotoxicological potential. Furthermore, antimicrobial agents (a. k. a., bactericides or biocides) were selected as model contaminants because they are designed specifically to deactivate microorganisms, are heavily used in the U. S with over $ 1 billion in yearly sales, and have been measured in biosolids. Overall, the objectives of this dissertation were to: 1) develop a rapid, high-throughput functional assay that measured denitrification inhibition for screening potential ecological impacts of biosolids-derived antimicrobial agents, 2) determine the potential effects of common and emerging biosolids-derived antimicrobial agents on denitrification by a model soil denitrifier, Paracoccus denitrificans PD 1222, 3) examine the impacts of the most commonly used antimicrobial, triclosan (TCS), on wastewater treatment efficiency in bench scale sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) coupled with anaerobic digesters, 4) examine the impacts of biosolids aged and spiked with TCS on denitrification under simulated agricultural soil conditions, and 5) evaluate potential impacts of TCS in `traditional' biosolids on denitrification in agricultural soil under field conditions. The first phase of research pertaining to Objectives 1 and 2 examined the baseline interactions between biosolids-derived antimicrobial agents and soil microbial ecology. However, to isolate the effect of an individual contaminant from the myriad of contaminants found in biosolids, there was a need for developing a rapid, high-throughput method to evaluate general ecotoxicity. In the first part of this dissertation, we developed a novel assay that measured denitrification inhibition in a model soil denitrifier, Paracoccus denitrificans Pd 1222. Two common (TCS and triclocarban) and four emerging (2, 4, 5 trichlorophenol, 2 -benzyl- 4 -chlorophenol, 2 -chloro- 4 -phenylphenol, and bis(5 -chloro- 2 -hydroxyphenyl) methane) antimicrobial agents found in biosolids were analyzed as model contaminants. Overall, the assay was reproducible and measured impacts on denitrification over three orders of magnitude exposure. The lowest observable adverse effect concentrations (LOAECs) were 1. 04 μM for TCS, 3. 17 μM for triclocarban, 0. 372 μM for bis-(5 -chloro- 2 -hydroxyphenyl) methane, 4. 89 μM for 2 -chloro- 4 -phenyl phenol, 45. 7 μM for 2 -benzyl- 4 -chorophenol, and 50. 6 μM for 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol. Compared with gene expression and cell viability based methods, the denitrification assay was more sensitive and resulted in lower LOAECs. Of the six compounds examined, four resulted in LOAECs that were below or within an order of magnitude of concentrations that were measured in the environment, indicating potential ecological impacts. In the second part of the dissertation, the impacts of emerging contaminants were examined first under laboratory conditions mimicking wastewater treatment processes (Objective 3) and then agricultural fields (Objective 4). For this phase, TCS, which is the most widely used antimicrobial agent and identified in the first phase for potential ecological impacts, was used as the model contaminant. To mimic wastewater treatment processes, bench scale SBRs coupled with anaerobic digesters were set up and operated. The SBRS and digesters were seeded with activated and anaerobically digested sludge from the North Durham Water Reclamation Facility (NDWRF, Durham, NC). Reactors were fed synthetic wastewater with or without 0. 73 &muM of TCS. Samples were taken periodically to monitor chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium (NH 4 +), nitrate (NO 3 -), nitrite (NO 2 -), total suspended solids (TSS), volatile suspended solids (VSS), dissolved oxygen (DO), and phosphate (PO 4 3 -) and pH. In addition, biomass samples were collected for DNA extraction and microbial community analysis using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of 16 S SSU rDNA. Methane production was also monitored for the anaerobic digesters. In addition, the final digested biosolids that were generated from the SBRs fed with and without TCS were analyzed for TCS concentration, TSS, VSS, TKN, phosphorus (as P 2 O 5), potassium (as K 2 O), and pH. Overall, biological processes associated with nitrogen removal (nitrification and denitrification), were impacted by TCS entering the SBRs regardless of the starting microbial community. Both of the SBRs that were not receiving TCS reached steady-state at greater than 92 % NH 4 +, removal within the first week of operation, whereas the SBRs receiving TCS took 42 and 63 days to reach steady-state removal at that level. However, while NH 4 + removal was temporarily inhibited, elevated levels of NO 3 - and NO 2 - in the effluent of the TCS fed SBRs, suggested longer-term impacts on nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) and denitrifiers. After Day 58, the NO 3 - effluent concentration for the SBRs receiving TCS was 3. 9 ± 0. 16 mg/L, which was 2. 4 times greater than the NO 3 - effluent of the SBRs not receiving TCS (1. 7 ± 0. 08 mg/L). Similarly, after Day 58, the NO 2 - effluent of the SBRs receiving TCS reached a steady-state concentration of 8. 7 ± 0. 75 mg/L. The mean NO 2 - concentration in the controls after Day 58 was 7. 7 times lower at 1. 1 ± 0. 78 mg/L, but was still trending towards 0 when the reactors were stopped. No inhibition was observed for COD and PO 4 3 - removal. In addition, non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination analysis showed that the microbial communities between SBRS fed with and without TCS were similar on Day 0, but increased in difference to Day 41, around when the major changes in nitrification were observed. After a slight increase in similarity between the control and TCS SBR microbial communities on Day 41, the communities increased in difference to Day 63. To mimic agricultural field conditions, containers of soil were amended with the biosolids generated from the SBRs. The containers were maintained in a growth-chamber to simulate field lighting and watering conditions. Three biosolids treatments were examined: 1) biosolids generated from the SBRs not fed TCS, but that still had low backgrounds of TCS (a. k. a., Control Biosolids); 2) biosolids generated from the SBRs fed with TCS (a. k. a., Aged TCS Biosolids); and 3) biosolids that were generated by the SBRs not fed TCS, but spiked with TCS 24 h before application (a. k. a., Spiked TCS Biosolids). Alfalfa was planted in half of the containers receiving the Control and Aged TCS Biosolids to assess differences due to vegetation. To assess the overall ecotoxicity of biosolids aged and spiked with TCS, the function, abundance, and diversity of the soil denitrifying communities were examined. The impacts on total bacteria abundance and diversity were also examined for comparison. Specifically, the denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) assay was used to measure functional impacts, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to measure impacts on abundance, and T-RFLP was used to measure impacts on diversity. Correlations between these methods were also examined for possible interactions between denitrifier function and community structure and to provide insight into targets of inhibition. Lastly, a denitrification inhibition score was developed to quantify global impacts of TCS on denitrification. The containers with plants that received biosolids aged with and spiked with TCS showed potential long-term inhibition based on measurement of soil denitrification at 26. 9 ± 4. 6 μg/kg and 68. 6 ± 26. 9 μg/kg of TCS, respectively. Denitrifier abundance and diversity, however, were more sensitive to TCS in biosolids and inhibition was observed throughout the experiment, with maximum inhibition on Days 7 and 28. Inhibition of denitrifier abundance and diversity was observed at TCS concentrations as low as 17. 9 ± 1. 93 μg/L, which was about 10 to 3000 times lower than concentrations reported by other studies that showed impacts on other functional endpoints (i. e., respiration, phosphatase activity, NO 3 - and NO 2 - production, and Cy 17 stress biomarker abundance), even after taking pH into account. Five significant correlations were developed, three of which related qPCR and the DEA assay, or abundance and activity. However, the analyses that were correlated did not yield the same results as far as significant inhibition in the presence of TCS. Thus, while the results suggested some relatedness between activity, abundance, and diversity, the results generally support the use of multiple methods to determine the ecotoxicity of biosolids-derived organic contaminants. As a result, a denitrification inhibition score was developed that took into account all three methods to determine the overall ecotoxicity of TCS in biosolids. Overall, the denitrification inhibition score showed that denitrification was inhibited by both biosolids that were aged and spiked with TCS over the extent of the 84 day experiment, but maximum inhibition occurred after a week to about a month. While the denitrification inhibition score indicated that the TCS in the biosolids aged with TCS was less bioavailable than in the spiked biosolids, the impacts of the aged and spiked biosolids could have also been due to differences in TCS concentrations. Objective 5 consisted of a long-term soil sampling campaign on four agricultural fields <b>receiving</b> <b>Class</b> B municipal biosolids. Soil samples were taken before and after biosolids application and were analyzed to elucidate potential impacts of TCS in the biosolids on denitrification. Again, to assess the overall impacts of TCS on the soil denitrifying community, the DEA assay, qPCR, and T-RFLP were used to measure impacts on function, abundance, and diversity, respectively. Similar to Objective 4, the analysis included an examination of potential correlations between denitrifying community structure and function, and quantification of global impacts using the denitrification inhibition score. As expected, the results in this pilot-study reflected the complexity of the system that was analyzed and many more samples, which account for variables including, but not limited to soil characteristics, biosolids characteristics, biosolids application rates, and chemical composition and quantities, would be needed to show any statistically significant differences. Nevertheless, several key results were obtained. Again potential long-term inhibition of denitrification was observed using the DEA assay, however the effects of exhaustion of resources, such as NO 3 -, or significant changes in the local environment were suspected, but could not be verified. Inhibition was also observed for denitrifier abundance, but little to no inhibition was observed when examining the relative number of denitrifying species. Thus, while the abundance of denitrifiers was reduced, and denitrification was eventually depressed, the number of species in the soil remained constant. When looking at the denitrification inhibition score, which took all three measurements into account, increased inhibition over time was observed with the exception of the measurements on Days 30 and 103, which indicated overall, but weak inhibition of denitrification by the application of biosolids. NMS ordinations showed no correlation between the shift in denitrifying microbial community and TCS. Because of the complexity of the soil and biosolids and because of the myriad of contaminants likely in the biosolids, the results may not be significant and a more in-depth study was recommended. Overall, the results presented in this dissertation provide a systematic evaluation of the effects of biosolids-derived TCS on agricultural soil microbial ecology. First, it was demonstrated that statistically significant inhibition of denitrification could be used as a potential indicator of biosolids-derived emerging organic contaminant ecotoxicity. The denitrification assay that was developed was then used to analyze ecotoxicological potential of six emerging biosolids-derived antimicrobial agents, and found inhibition of denitrification at environmentally relevant concentrations. The most widely used antimicrobial agent, TCS, was further shown to inhibit wastewater treatment processes, as well as, denitrification in simulated agricultural conditions after being aged with and spiked into biosolids. In addition, evidence showing potential inhibition of denitrification by TCS in `traditional' biosolids under field conditions was also obtained. Based on these results, this dissertation asserts that biosolids-derived emerging organic contaminants pose a potential risk to agricultural soil microbial ecology and overall soil health. Future studies, however, are needed to examine the impacts of other contaminants that might be flagged with the assay developed in this dissertation under more complex conditions mimicking the environment. Furthermore, other research is needed to examine the role microbial communities play in the bioavailability of emerging contaminants, especially TCS, and a more extensive, in-depth study is needed to characterize the individual impacts of emerging contaminants on soil microbial communities under field conditions.
