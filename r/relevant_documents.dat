5|$|Wagner's musical {{output is}} listed by the Wagner-Werk-Verzeichnis (WWV) as {{comprising}} 113 works, including fragments and projects. The first complete scholarly {{edition of his}} musical works in print was commenced in 1970 {{under the aegis of}} the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts and the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur of Mainz, and is presently under the editorship of Egon Voss. It will consist of 21 volumes (57 books) of music and 10 volumes (13 books) of <b>relevant</b> <b>documents</b> and texts. As at October 2017, three volumes remain to be published.

5|$|Smith {{organised}} {{a meeting}} with Johnston, starting at 09:00 on 18 August, where he informed the British High Commissioner that he had considered the Lisbon appointment extensively, {{with the help of}} Dupont, several legal advisers, and a judge of the Rhodesian High Court. The judge had examined the <b>relevant</b> <b>documents,</b> and had {{come to the conclusion that}} Dupont's interpretation of them was correct. Smith therefore felt certain that Reedman's appointment was legitimate so long as Portugal agreed. A long argument ensued, with neither man willing to budge. Smith said that he had always tried to be flexible and civil, but that he and his government felt they had to make a stand. By making clear to Lisbon the exact nature of their proposed representative, and informing Britain of their intent, Smith said the Rhodesians had filled every legal obligation.|$|E

5|$|The {{allegations}} were first sparked by University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran, {{who claimed that}} full versions of government documents proved Canada had willful knowledge that torture would occur before handing detainees to Afghan authorities. Subsequent to this, two official complaints have led to official investigations and hearings by the Military Police Complaints Commission (MPCC). One of these unveiled parliamentary testimony by diplomat Richard Colvin, who claimed that many detainees were probably tortured, {{and it was a}} standard operating procedure for Afghan interrogators. The allegations have led to a showdown in the Canadian House of Commons, as opposition Members of Parliament (MPs) had called for the releasing of <b>relevant</b> <b>documents</b> in full and unredacted form, claiming parliamentary privilege to see them. The government maintained that they had a duty to protect Canadian soldiers and citizens as the documents contained sensitive information.|$|E
5|$|Andersen's {{auditors}} were {{pressured by}} Enron's management to defer recognizing the charges {{from the special}} purpose entities as its credit risks became known. Since the entities would never return a profit, accounting guidelines required that Enron should take a write-off, where {{the value of the}} entity was removed from the balance sheet at a loss. To pressure Andersen into meeting Enron's earnings expectations, Enron would occasionally allow accounting companies Ernst & Young or PricewaterhouseCoopers to complete accounting tasks to create the illusion of hiring a new company to replace Andersen. Although Andersen was equipped with internal controls to protect against conflicted incentives of local partners, it failed to prevent conflict of interest. In one case, Andersen's Houston office, which performed the Enron audit, was able to overrule any critical reviews of Enron's accounting decisions by Andersen's Chicago partner. In addition, after news of U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigations of Enron were made public, Andersen would later shred several tons of <b>relevant</b> <b>documents</b> and delete nearly 30,000 e-mails and computer files, causing accusations of a cover-up.|$|E
5|$|Johnston {{dismissed}} Smith's argument, {{asserting that}} neither the Federation nor Rhodesia had ever made such an appointment (this was actually false; the Federal government had opened independent diplomatic missions in South Africa and Portuguese Mozambique, and Rhodesia retained them both). Johnston concluded that Rhodesia was trying to prematurely advance its international standing. The previous entrustments, he said, {{had been made to}} allow Britain and Rhodesia to cooperate subject to Whitehall's ultimate authority, and did not entitle Rhodesia to do as it liked in the field of external affairs, especially if its chosen line ran counter to Britain's. In an attempt to intimidate Smith, Johnston sternly asked why the Rhodesian Prime Minister would risk causing a major international incident by deliberately defying Britain; Smith replied that following Britain's several slights against Rhodesia over the previous year and a half, Salisbury would not accept another. The conversation continued in this manner for some time afterwards. Smith proposed that the <b>relevant</b> <b>documents</b> be examined jointly by two judges, one British and one Rhodesian, but Johnston refused this. The meeting ended without agreement.|$|E

25|$|In 1897, Rosenblum began a torrid {{affair with}} Margaret Thomas (née Callaghan), the {{youthful}} wife of Reverend Hugh Thomas, {{shortly before the}} latter's death. Rosenblum first met Thomas in London via his Ozone Preparations Company. Thomas had a kidney inflammation and was intrigued by the miracle cures peddled by Rosenblum. Thomas introduced Rosenblum to his young wife at his Manor House, {{and over the next}} six months they began having an affair. On 4 March 1898, Thomas altered his will and appointed Margaret as an executor. A week after the new will was made, Thomas and his nurse arrived at Newhaven Harbour Station. On 12 March 1898 Thomas was found dead in his hotel room. A mysterious Dr. T. W. Andrew, whose physical description matched that of Sigmund Rosenblum, appeared to certify Thomas's death as generic influenza and after signing the <b>relevant</b> <b>documents</b> proclaimed that there was no need for an inquest.
