The directions {{of all the}} flows in the original SCN are narrowed down into one single way by dividing up all the possible circulation of both manufacturing and transportation. Each node of the SCN is simplified according to its different functions, outputs and raw material sources. According to the layer of the product structure tree, all the divided nodes are combined so that each route includes all the raw material sources of the finished product. The most suitable plants location under the time constraints are worked out {{through the application of}} generalized permanent labeling algorithm on the combined SCN. Finally, by tracing backward to the original SCN according to the most suitable plants location and <b>routes</b> <b>selection,</b> the real optimal plants location and <b>routes</b> <b>selection</b> can be found out...|$|R
40|$|The goal {{of traffic}} {{management}} is efficiently utilizing network resources via adapting of source sending rates and <b>routes</b> <b>selection.</b> Traditionally, {{this problem is}} formulated into a utilization maximization problem. The single-path routing scheme fails to react to instantaneous network congestion. Multi-path routing schemes thus have been proposed aiming at improving network efficiency. Unfortunately, the natural optimization problem to consider is concave but not strictly concave. It thus brings a huge challenge to design stable multi-path congestion control algorithms. In this paper, we propose a generalized multi-path utility maximization model to consider the problem of <b>routes</b> <b>selection</b> and flow control, and derive a family of multi-path dual congestion control algorithms. We show that the proposed algorithms are stable {{in the absence of}} delays. We also derive decentralized and scalable sufficient conditions for a particular scheme when propagation delays exist in networks. Simulations are implemented using both Matlab and NS 2, on which evaluation of the proposed multi-path dual algorithms is exerted. The comparison results, between the proposed algorithms and the other two existing algorithms, show that the proposed multi-path dual algorithms with appropriate parameter settings can achieve a stable aggregated throughput while maintaining fairness among the involved users.

30|$|Subway and bus {{networks}} work as {{an integrated}} multiplex transportation system and play an indispensable role in modern big cities. Even though a variety of works have investigated the coupling dynamics of multiplex transportation networks, empirical data that validates the determinant coupling factors are still lacking. In this paper, we employ smartcard data of 2.4 million subway and bus passengers in Shenzhen, China to study the coupling dynamics of subway and bus networks. Surprisingly, the coupling of subway and bus networks is not notably influenced by the time-varying speed ratio of the two network layers but is jointly determined by the distribution of travel demands and transportation facilities. Our findings highlight {{the important role of}} real travel demand data in analyzing the coupling dynamics of multiplex transportation networks. They also suggest that the speed ratio of different network layers, which was regarded as a key factor in determining coupling strength, has a negligible effect on travelers’ <b>route</b> <b>selections,</b> and thus the coupling dynamics of multiplex transportation networks.|$|R

Current route advice systems present a single route to the driver based on static evaluation criteria, {{with little or no}} recourse if the driver finds this solution unsatisfactory.

Our route advice agent interacts with the driver to generate routes that he or she finds satisfactory, uses these interactions to build a model of the driver's preferences, and then uses the model to generate better routes for that driver in future interactions. As the preference model becomes more accurate, the need for interaction decreases and the agent's autonomy increases.
