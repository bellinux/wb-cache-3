Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter – <b>rippling</b> the skin of the throat and pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the main}} morphometric and dynamic {{properties}} of aeolian <b>ripples</b> formed in a wind tunnel during the deposition of natural, silt-sized dust particles over a flat horizontal surface are investigated. <b>Ripples</b> and <b>ripple</b> patterns are studied after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90 minutes of dust deposition, and this for 4 free stream wind velocities ranging from 113 cm. s- 1 to 160 cm. s- 1 (friction velocity: 3. 0 to 3. 9 cm. s- 1). All velocities are well below deflation threshold. The following <b>ripple</b> parameters are investigated: general <b>ripple</b> shape, <b>ripple</b> spacing, <b>ripple</b> height, <b>ripple</b> flattening, <b>ripple</b> length, <b>ripple</b> symmetry, <b>ripple</b> singularities, <b>ripple</b> orientation, <b>ripple</b> sinuosity and <b>ripple</b> migration. Mean {{values for the}} <b>ripple</b> fields as well as dispersion within the <b>ripple</b> fields are examined, and correlations with mean wind speed are made.

40|$|<b>Ripples</b> are {{generated}} and modified by wind-generated waves and their profiles {{are controlled by}} the nature of the near-bottom wave motion and by the size of the bed material. Wave-formed <b>ripples</b> develop under a definable set of conditions called the <b>ripple</b> regime. The <b>ripple</b> regime is bounded by those conditions that initiate grain motion, low-wave intensity, and by those that cause the disappearance of <b>ripples,</b> onset of sheet flow. Sheet flow occurs when intense wave motion causes several grain layers to be in motion. Three distinct <b>ripple</b> types occur in nearshbre areas of fine sand- relict <b>ripples,</b> vortex <b>ripples,</b> and transition <b>ripples.</b> Vortex and transition <b>ripples</b> lie within the active <b>ripple</b> regime, whereas relict <b>ripples</b> do not. <b>Ripples</b> in fine sand were studied in the field at La Jolla, Cali-fornia, where profiles were obtained using a newly developed high-reso-lution sonar capable of vertical resolution of the order of one milli...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{this case}} report was to study the {{relationship}} between high-frequency oscillations (HFOs), spikes, and seizures in a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy. IntroductionDuring intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), HFOs {{are thought to be}} a marker for the seizure onset zone (SOZ). High-frequency oscillations are classified into <b>ripples</b> with frequencies of 70 – 200 Hz and fast <b>ripples</b> with frequencies of 200 – 500 Hz. Although HFOs are thought to be a marker for the SOZ, their relationship to spikes has not been studied in detail, especially within the SOZ. MethodsWe studied the time course of <b>ripples</b> and spikes in a patient undergoing intracranial EEG. Medications were discontinued on day one. She suffered three seizures on day three. Her SOZ was in the left hippocampus, which displayed abundant <b>ripples</b> and spikes. <b>Ripples,</b> spikes with simultaneous <b>ripples,</b> and spikes without <b>ripples</b> were counted for this study. ResultsWe found that <b>ripples</b> and spikes in the SOZ had a marked diurnal variation. <b>Ripples,</b> spikes with <b>ripples,</b> and spikes without <b>ripples</b> increased and decreased in concert until just before seizure onset, when <b>ripples</b> and spikes with <b>ripples</b> increased markedly. Spikes without <b>ripples</b> did not increase. ConclusionsThese results support <b>ripples</b> as a marker for SOZ and show that they co-occur with spikes. Seizure onset was heralded by an increase in <b>ripples</b> and spikes with <b>ripples,</b> without an increase in spikes without <b>ripples.</b> We hypothesize that spikes associated with <b>ripples</b> may have a somewhat different pathophysiological mechanism than spikes not associated with <b>ripples,</b> differences that may be relevant for the timing of seizure onset...|$|R
5|$|The <b>rippling</b> preep and whistled sweeeooo {{calls of}} the Alpine chough are quite {{different}} from the more typically crow-like chee-ow vocalisations of the jackdaw and the red-billed chough. It also has a rolling churr alarm call, and a variety of quiet warbles and squeaks given by resting or feeding birds. In a study of chough calls throughout the Palearctic region it was found that call frequencies in the Alpine chough showed an inverse relationship between body size and frequency, being higher-pitched in smaller-bodied populations.|$|E

5|$|The stage {{show at the}} semi-final {{included}} Dustin in his trolley, {{wearing a}} silver suit. The trolley was dressed in green, white and gold, with the girls wearing gold dresses, green gloves and head-dresses in green, white and gold. Two of the male backing dancers wore large green, white and gold wings and danced around the stage, while the third back-up dancer wore a gold jump suit. The stage involved <b>rippling</b> effects of black and white, as well as waves of orange, white and green through the LCD screens on the stage.

5|$|Cirrocumulus clouds form in {{patches and}} cannot cast shadows. They {{commonly}} appear in regular, <b>rippling</b> patterns or in rows of clouds with clear areas between. Cirrocumulus are, like {{other members of}} the cumuliform and stratocumuliform categories, formed via convective processes. Significant growth of these patches indicates high-altitude instability and can signal the approach of poorer weather. The ice crystals in the bottoms of cirrocumulus clouds tend to be in the form of hexagonal cylinders. They are not solid, but instead tend to have stepped funnels coming in from the ends. Towards the top of the cloud, these crystals have a tendency to clump together. These clouds do not last long, and they tend to change into cirrus because as the water vapor continues to deposit on the ice crystals, they eventually begin to fall, destroying the upward convection. The cloud then dissipates into cirrus. Cirrocumulus clouds come in four species which are common to all three genus-types that have limited-convective or stratocumuliform characteristics: stratiformis, lenticularis, castellanus, and floccus. They are iridescent when the constituent supercooled water droplets are all about the same size.|$|E

5|$|Mulder goes to {{investigate}} the facility Sheriff Frass mentioned. Before breaking in, he and Scully discuss the odd behavior of the roaches, with Scully hypothesizing that the roaches could be an invasive species. Inside the facility, which resembles a typical house, Mulder sees the walls <b>rippling</b> and is quickly surrounded by roaches. He is then confronted by Dr. Bambi Berenbaum (Bobbie Phillips), a researcher from the Department of Agriculture who is studying cockroaches to develop more effective methods of pest control. Berenbaum has great interest in insects and, incidentally, believes that some UFOs are actually insect swarms flying through electrically charged airspaces. Yet another death occurs in Mulder's hotel, with the individual being found covered in roaches that quickly flee. At this point, Mulder believes that the individual simply died of fright, though Scully begins to wonder {{what is going on}} and decides to head up there herself.|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{methods to}} parameterise wave-formed <b>rippled</b> {{sediment}} beds involve {{the determination of}} a characteristic <b>ripple</b> height and length from the <b>rippled</b> surface. A substantial number of previous studies have indicated <b>ripple</b> fields formed in shallow water under real sea conditions will have considerable spatial and temporal variation in their parameters. There has been little work undertaken on quantifying the spatial variation of <b>rippled</b> beds {{in terms of their}} characteristic <b>ripple</b> height and length. This paper will present a method used to calculate a histogram of the <b>ripple</b> heights and lengths from the <b>rippled</b> surface using the zero up-crossing method. The inherent variability of <b>ripple</b> parameters will be discussed in terms of two sets of laboratory measurements taken at two very different scales. The conclusion of the paper is that traditional methods to predict <b>ripple</b> parameters have a bias towards <b>rippled</b> beds formed under medium mobility conditions. At higher and lower mobility conditions <b>rippled</b> beds will be inherently variable with a distribution of <b>ripple</b> parameters existing on a given bed at any given time...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTemperature-controlled atomic force {{microscopy}} (AFM) {{has been}} used to visualize and study the structure and kinetics of <b>ripple</b> phases in one-component dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and two-component dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine-distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC-DSPC) lipid bilayers. The lipid bilayers are mica-supported double bilayers in which ripple-phase formation occurs in the top bilayer. In one-component DPPC lipid bilayers, the stable and metastable <b>ripple</b> phases were observed. In addition, a third <b>ripple</b> structure with approximately twice the wavelength of the metastable <b>ripples</b> was seen. From height profiles of the AFM images, estimates of the amplitudes of the different <b>ripple</b> phases are reported. To elucidate the processes of <b>ripple</b> formation and disappearance, a ripple-phase DPPC lipid bilayer was taken through the pretransition in the cooling and the heating direction and the disappearance and formation of <b>ripples</b> was visualized. It was found that both the disappearance and formation of <b>ripples</b> take place virtually one <b>ripple</b> at a time, thereby demonstrating the highly anisotropic nature of the <b>ripple</b> phase. Furthermore, when a two-component DMPC-DSPC mixture was heated from the <b>ripple</b> phase and into the ripple-phase/fluid-phase coexistence temperature region, the AFM images revealed that several dynamic properties of the <b>ripple</b> phase are important for the melting behavior of the lipid mixture. Onset of melting is observed at grain boundaries between different <b>ripple</b> types and different <b>ripple</b> orientations, and the longer-wavelength metastable <b>ripple</b> phase melts before the shorter-wavelength stable <b>ripple</b> phase. Moreover, it was observed that the <b>ripple</b> phase favors domain growth along the <b>ripple</b> direction and is responsible for creating straight-edged domains with 60 ° and 120 ° angles, as reported previously...|$|R

5|$|Occasionally, {{the player}} can find {{rustling}} patches {{of grass and}} <b>rippling</b> water, where they can encounter either a rare Pokémon, a Pokémon {{more common in the}} opposite game version, or the highest evolutionary form of a Pokémon whose lower forms can normally be found in the area. This {{is the only way to}} capture Pokémon such as Audino, Emolga, and Alomomola. Also, dust clouds in caves and the shadows of flying Pokémon on certain bridges can be entered to either find a rare item or encounter Drilbur, Excadrill, Ducklett, or Swanna, none of which can be found in the wild otherwise. Occasionally, when throwing a Poké Ball, the capture rate is highly increased, triggered by a random event. There are also new side-games and sidequests: the player can compete in Pokémon Musicals, a side-game similar to the Pokémon Contests of previous games; the Battle Subway, similar to the Battle Towers and Battle Frontiers of previous games; and on the Royal Unova, a cruise ship that the player can ride and fight Trainers aboard to win otherwise rare items.|$|E
5|$|The {{upgraded}} engine offered better {{speed efficiency}} and new graphical features. While both the original Tomb Raider and Tomb Raider II used a grid system where developers could build the levels {{with a set}} of blocks, Tomb Raider IIIs system incorporated triangular polygons, allowing developers to achieve greater detail and more complex architectural structures. The triangles also allowed developers to implement the game's quicksand and <b>rippling</b> water features. The dynamic lighting system was improved with coloured lighting and better water reflection, making Tomb Raider III more atmospheric than its predecessors. The team also implemented new weather effects such as rain, snow, and wind. The game features more particle effects, offering more realistic explosions and smoke. All the textures used in the game were drawn in true colour before being rendered by the graphics engine, resulting in a better output quality.|$|E

40|$|Objective: <b>Ripples</b> (80 - 250. Hz) {{have been}} shown to be a more {{specific}} biomarker for the epileptogenic zone than epileptic spikes in intracranial EEG and even surface EEG. <b>Ripples</b> often co-occur with spikes. We investigated the spatiotemporal relation between spikes and <b>ripples,</b> and differences between spikes that do and do not co-occur with <b>ripples.</b> Methods: We marked 50 time points with spikes in bipolar surface EEG during NREM sleep in patients with focal or multifocal epilepsy. We marked <b>ripples</b> that occurred with spikes and calculated parameters relating spikes and ripples: the duration, amplitude and slope of spikes, the timing of the start of <b>ripples</b> and spikes and the proportion of overlap. Results: In total 219 <b>ripples</b> and 5995 individual spikes were marked in 31 patients. Spikes with <b>ripples</b> were on average shorter, had higher amplitude and higher slope than spikes without <b>ripples.</b> 64 % of <b>ripples</b> started before spikes started. Spikes occurred on 13 (5 - 26) channels per patient, and <b>ripples</b> on 3 (0 - 14) channels, which were also spike channels.

40|$|Unique {{high-frequency}} oscillations of 250 to 500 Hz, termed fast <b>ripples,</b> {{have been}} identified in seizure-generating limbic areas in rats made epileptic by intrahippocampal injection of kainic acid, and in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. In the rat, fast <b>ripples</b> clearly are generated by a different neuronal population than normally occurring endogenous <b>ripple</b> oscillations (100 – 200 Hz), but this distinction has not been previously evaluated in humans. The characteristics of oscillations in the <b>ripple</b> and fast <b>ripple</b> frequency bands were compared in the entorhinal cortex of patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy using local field potential and unit recordings from chronically implanted bundles of eight microelectrodes with tips spaced 500 m apart. The results showed that <b>ripple</b> oscillations possessed different voltage versus depth profiles compared with fast <b>ripple</b> oscillations. Fast <b>ripple</b> oscillations usually demonstrated a reversal of polarity in the middle layers of entorhinal cortex, whereas <b>ripple</b> oscillations rarely showed reversals across entorhinal cortex layers.

A set of new formulas for {{the prediction of}} the <b>ripple</b> characteristics is proposed {{with an emphasis on}} the dis-appearance of the <b>ripples.</b> The <b>ripple</b> wavelength was observed to be proportional to the bottom wave excursion but also to be a function of the grain-related Shields parameter and wave period parameter introduced by Mogridge et al.

The effect of the <b>ripple</b> characteristics on the roughness height and the calculation of the bed shear stress is also discussed.
