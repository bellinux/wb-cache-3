40|$|A limited {{understanding}} of mortgage contracts {{and the risks}} involved {{may have contributed to}} the outbreak of the 2007 – 2008 financial crisis. We developed a special questionnaire relating mortgage loan decisions to financial knowledge and financial advice. Our results demonstrate that homeowners appear to be well aware of mortgage risks. Large loans relative to home value are perceived as <b>riskier,</b> as are loans with large mortgage payments relative to income and loans linked to investment vehicles. Homeowners with <b>riskier</b> mortgages indicated that they could encounter financial problems should house prices or their income decline. Homeowners with relatively low debt literacy are more likely to take out traditional mortgages with principal repayments over the maturity of the loan. <b>Riskier</b> mortgages are more prevalent among homeowners with a better {{understanding of}} loan contracts. Financially less sophisticated homeowners consulting mortgage brokers, too, hold <b>riskier</b> mortgages...|$|R
30|$|In addition, when Euribor is the {{benchmark}} interest rate, the ratio between appraisal and transaction prices decreases in 5.4  percentage points. This result brings evidence that lenders tends to use RIML for <b>riskier</b> mortgages. By construction, the RIML {{is not only}} higher but also less volatile and react less intensively {{to changes in the}} market interest rates than the Euribor. This circumstance makes the RIML more advantageous for lenders, especially for <b>riskier</b> borrowers. As a result, we use this variable to capture unobserved characteristics of the <b>riskier</b> borrowers. In this sense we expect negative sign for the Euribor variable.|$|R

5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in <b>risky</b> situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. <b>Risky</b> situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E

It was considered too <b>risky</b> to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E

40|$|Trade {{credit is}} a {{non-bank}} financing {{offered by a}} supplier to finance the purchase of its product. Trade credit {{is one of the}} important sources of debt financing which can substitute bank loan. Trade credit is prevailing among <b>riskier</b> borrowers, competing with bank loan in corporate loan market. The prevalence of trade credit implies that there exist mutual economic benefits for both suppliers and buyers from transacting trade credits even though the default rate of trade credits is much higher than that of bank loans. This paper models the economic incentive for product suppliers to offer trade credits to <b>riskier</b> borrowing firms which {{might not be able to}} obtain financing from conventional and specialized financial institutions such as banks. When the product market is imperfect, a product supplier can obtain additional mark-up by increasing the sale of products. That is, there is a gain to offering trade credits to facilitate the purchase of inputs to <b>riskier</b> borrowing firms who cannot obtain bank financing. Therefore, trade credits service <b>riskier</b> borrowing firms than bank loans in the corporate loan market. The empirical analyses using Compustat and LPC DealScan data supports the theoretical prediction that a <b>riskier</b> borrower seek for more trade credit financing, independent of bank loan access...|$|R

5|$|Author Fred Brooks {{criticized the}} program's {{requirement}} for the Comanche {{to be capable of}} ferrying itself across the Atlantic as an example of excessive requirements being present in a project's design phase and of their costly repercussions. Williams observes that the Comanche's weight requirements were unachievable, and claimed that this was due to poor management, in which no party was allegedly aware of or in control of the rotorcraft's final weight; there were concerns that, when outfitted with actual equipment required for operations, the Comanche's engines would be incapable of lifting the total weight of the helicopter. Additionally, it has been claimed that it proved difficult to convince the Army that the program suffered from serious troubles while key individuals failed to realize the existence of insurmountable technical problems. Prized elements of the program, such as certain software capabilities and its integration, failed to foster confidence with Army overseers; several capabilities were viewed as having been unproven and <b>risky,</b> while the anticipated consumption of up to 40 per cent of the aviation budget by the Comanche alone {{for a number of years}} was considered to be extreme. According to Williams, it was concluded that the Army's aviation budget would be better spent on the delivery of less <b>risky</b> and more critical needs.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{structure}} of loan syndicates and analyzes the participation by investment banks and other non-bank lenders in such financings. We find that investment banks {{are more likely to}} lead syndicated loans to <b>riskier</b> borrowers than commercial banks. Investment banks also tend to participate more often in the <b>riskier</b> tranches of multi-facility loans. Though non-bank entities like finance companies, insurance companies, investment companies, CLOs, CDOs, mutual funds, and prime funds rarely play lead roles in syndications, they also participate more frequently in <b>riskier,</b> multi-facility syndicated credits. Maskara (2010) argues that multi-facility syndicated loans derive economic value from the participation of lender groups with varying levels of risk aversion. We provide empirical support for his theoretical arguments...|$|R
