3000|$|Regarding the <b>receive</b> <b>and</b> {{transmit}} beamforming, in this paper, {{we consider}} three different algorithms, namely ZF, MMSE <b>and</b> MSNR. <b>Receive</b> <b>and</b> transmit beamforming algorithms with those criteria have been derived in [8, 19] {{for the case}} of two-way relaying. The optimisation problem with those criteria for multi-way relaying can be written as in [8, 19]. Therefore, in this paper, we use the solution for <b>receive</b> <b>and</b> transmit beamforming from [8, 19] and extend them to suit non-regenerative multi-way relaying by using the permutation matrix as explained above. In the following, we explain the <b>receive</b> <b>and</b> transmit beamforming for the three SMTB algorithms.|$|R

The planning of <b>receiving</b> <b>and</b> shipping operations is among the least investigated topics in the literature. Some examples of potential problems to investigate are preparation of goods to be stored [53] and resource allocations, e.g., truck-dock assignment for <b>receiving</b> <b>and</b> delivery and order-truck assignment if orders of different customers are aggregated into one truck [54]. <b>Receiving</b> <b>and</b> shipping are the least investigated categories in the warehousing literature, with preparation operation and resource assignment as the main aspects explored.|$|R

5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it <b>received</b> <b>and</b> published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many of the Romantic poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E
