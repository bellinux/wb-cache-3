Molecular beams seeded with NO or with Br 2 and an initial pulse width of greater or equal to 200 microseconds were passed through a spinning <b>chopper</b> <b>wheel,</b> which was driven by a brushless DC in vacuo motor at a range of speeds, from 3, 000 rpm to 80, 000 rpm. The resulting duration of the molecular-beam pulses measured at the laser detection volume ranged from 80 microseconds to 13 microseconds, and was the same for both NO and Br 2. The duration {{is consistent with a}} simple analytical model, and the minimum pulse width measured is limited by the spreading of the beam between the chopper and the detection point {{as a consequence of the}} longitudinal velocity distribution of the beam. The setup adopted here effectively eliminates buildup of background gas without the use of a differential pumping stage, and a clean narrow pulse is obtained with low rotational temperature...|$|R

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{presents a}} high-speed electromechanical shutter which {{has at least}} two <b>rotary</b> beam <b>choppers</b> that are synchronized using a phase-locked loop electronic control to reduce the duty cycle. These choppers have blade means that can comprise discs or drums, each having about 60 (+/- 15) slots which are from about 0. 3 to about 0. 8 mm wide and about 5 to about 20 mm long (radially) which are evenly distributed through out 360 ?, and a third <b>rotary</b> <b>chopper</b> which is optically aligned has {{a small number of}} slots, such as for example, 1 to 10 slots which are about 1 to about 2 mm wide and about 5 to about 20 mm long (radially).

50|$|Mice {{used the}} same basic system for {{determining}} motion, but had the problem that the ball was {{in contact with the}} desk or mousepad. In order to provide smooth motion the balls were often covered with an anti-slip surface treatment, which was, by design, sticky. Rolling the mouse tended to pick up any dirt and drag it into the system where it would clog the <b>chopper</b> <b>wheels,</b> demanding cleanup. In contrast the trackball is in contact only with the user's hand, which tends to be cleaner. In the late 1990s both mice and trackballs began using direct optical tracking which follows dots on the ball, avoiding the need for anti-slip surface treatment.|$|R
40|$|In our {{laboratory}} a {{novel and}} convenient technique {{has been developed}} to generate an intense pulsed cyano radical beam to be employed in crossed molecular beam experiments investigating the chemical dynamics of bimolecular reactions. CN radicals in their ground electronic state 2 S 1 are produced in situ via laser ablation of a graphite rod at 266 nm and 30 mJ output power and subsequent reaction of the ablated species with molecular nitrogen, which acts also as a seeding gas. A <b>chopper</b> <b>wheel</b> located after the ablation source and before the collision center selects a 9 ms segment of the beam. By changing the delay time between the pulsed valve and the choppper wheel, we can select {{a section of the}} pulsed CN~X 2 S 1 ! beam choosing different velocities in the range of 900 – 1920 ms 21 with speed ratios from 4 to 8. A high-stability analog oscillator drives the motor of the <b>chopper</b> <b>wheel</b> ~deviations less than 100 ppm of the period!, and a high-precision reversible motor driver is interfaced to the rotating carbon rod. Both units are essential to ensure a stable cyanogen radical beam with velocity fluctuations of less than 3 %. The high intensity of the pulsed supersonic CN beam of about 2 – 331011 cm 23 is three orders of magnitude higher than supersonic cyano radical beams employed in previous crossed molecular beams experiments. This data together with the tunable velocity range clearly demonstrate the unique power of our newly developed in situ production of a supersonic CN radical beam. This versatile concept is extendible to generate other intense, pulsed supersonic beams of highly unstable diatomic radicals, among them BC, BN, BO, BS, CS, SiC, SiN, SiO, and SiS, which are expected to {{play a crucial role in}} interstellar chemistry, chemistry in the solar system, and/or combustion processes...|$|R

50|$|The slotted optical switch, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} opto switch or optical switch {{but not to}} be confused with the optical component, is a device comprising a photoemitter (e.g. LED) and a photodetector (e.g. photodiode) mounted in a single package so that the photoemitter normally illuminates the photodetector, but an opaque object can be inserted in a slot between them so as to break the beam. Associated circuitry is provided which changes state when the beam is interrupted. For example, the carriage of a computer printer may be fitted with a projection which interrupts the beam of a slotted switch when it reaches the end of its travel, causing circuitry to react appropriately.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of naturally fluorescing components (autofluorophors) encountered in environmentally sourced samples can greatly hinder the detection and identification of fluorescently labeled target using fluorescence microscopy. Time-resolved fluorescence microscopy (TRFM) {{is a technique}} that reduces the effects of autofluorescence through precisely controlled time delays. Lanthanide chelates have fluorescence lifetimes many orders of magnitude greater than typical autofluorophors, and persist in their luminescence long after autofluorescence has ceased. An intense short pulse of (UV) light is used to excite fluorescence in the sample and after a short delay period the longer persisting fluorescence from the chelate is captured with an image-intensified CCD camera. The choice of pulsed excitation source for TRFM has a large impact on the price and performance of the instrument. A flashlamp with a short pulse duration was selected for our instrument {{because of the high}} spectral energy in the UV region and short pulse length. However, flash output decays with an approximate lifetime of 18 μs and the TRFM requires a long-lived chelate to ensure probe fluorescence is still visible after decay of the flash plasma. We synthesized a recently reported fluorescent chelate (BHHCT) and conjugated it to a monoclonal antibody directed against the water-borne parasite Giardia lamblia. Fluorescence lifetime of the construct was determined to be 339 μs ± 14 μs and provided a 45 -fold enhancement of labeled Giardia over background using a gate delay of 100 μs.

Our interferometric coronagraph, known as the "Palomar Fiber Nuller" (PFN), is located downstream of the Palomar adaptive optics (AO) system and recombines the two separate beams into a common singlemode fiber. The AO system acts as a "fringe tracker", maintaining the optical path difference (OPD) between the beams around an adjustable value, which is set to the central dark interference fringe. AO correction ensures high efficiency and stable injection of the beams into the single-mode fiber. A <b>chopper</b> <b>wheel</b> and a fast photometer are used to record short (< 50 ms per beam) interleaved sequences of background, individual beam and interferometric signals. In order to analyze these chopped null data sequences, we developed a new statistical method, baptized "Null Self-Calibration" (NSC), which provides astrophysical null measurements at the 0. 001 level, with 1 σ uncertainties as low as 0. 0003. Such accuracy translates into a dynamic range greater than 1000 : 1 within the diffraction limit, demonstrating that the approach effectively bridges the traditional gap between regular coronagraphs, limited in angular resolution, and long baseline visibility interferometers, whose dynamic range is restricted to ≃ 100 : 1.

40|$|Thermal {{infrared}} detectors {{based on}} MEMS bimorph beams {{have the potential}} to exceed the performance of current uncooled thermal infrared cameras both in terms of sensitivity and cost. These cameras are part of a rapidly growing industry are used for a vast array of applications such as military and civilian night vision, industrial monitoring, and medical imaging. Many researchers have explored the use of metal-ceramic MEMS bimorphs for this application even though it has long been acknowledged that polymer-ceramic bimorphs would be superior. However, because of the difficulties of designing and fabricating MEMS systems based on polymer-ceramic bimorphs, little progress has been made towards their development. 	This dissertation describes the initial design, fabrication, and testing of thermo-mechanical infrared sensors based on MEMS polymer-ceramic bimorph beams. Sensors based on bimorphs composed of both the biopolymer chitin on poly-silicon and OCG- 825 photoresist on poly-silicon were fabricated and tested. Chitin bimorphs were fabricated using a novel photolithographic chitosan process previously developed for this research. A sensor design based on a residual stress and ambient temperature compensating geometry and which includes novel features such as vertically aligned thermal isolation regions and selective shielding is presented. Simplified sensors were tested using an optical readout method where the deformation of the sensors was observed as variations in the intensity of visible light reflected to a digital camera. In order to obtain quantitative measurements, image analysis was performed. While the feasibility of simply observing the average brightness of the light reflected from a sensor was demonstrated, several image processing algorithms were tested and shown to increase the signal to noise ratio. An IR source approximating a blackbody was combined with a series of filters and lenses to limit transmission of light to the sensor to wavelengths from approximately 1. 0 to 3. 6 microns. A periodic signal was produced by coupling a mechanical <b>chopper</b> <b>wheel</b> with the IR source. The sensor was able to detect these signals at frequencies of at least 5 Hz. By comparing the sensor signal to a known rate of warming of the IR source and the measured noise level at equilibrium, a noise equivalent temperature difference of as low as 360 mK was measured. In light of this encouraging and clear proof of concept, suggestions for achieving performance gains and developing novel imaging systems based on polymer-ceramic bimorphs through future research efforts are offered...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an ETU (Engineering Test Unit) <b>rotary</b> optical <b>chopper</b> with magnetic bearings. An ETU is required to be both flight-like, nearly identical to a flight unit without the need for material certifications, and demonstrate structural and performance integrity. A prototype breadboard design previously demonstrated the feasibility of meeting flight performance requirements using magnetic bearings. The chopper mechanism is a critical component of the High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) which will be flown on EOS-CHEM (Earth Observing System-Chemistry). Particularly noteworthy are the science requirements which demand high precision positioning and minimal power consumption along with full redundancy of coils and sensors in a miniature, lightweight package. The magnetic bearings are unique in their pole design to minimize parasitic losses and utilize collocated optical sensing. The motor is of an unusual disk-type ironless stator design. The ETU design has evolved from the breadboard design. A number of improvements have been incorporated into the ETU design. Active thrust control has been added along with changes to improve sensor stability, motor efficiency, and touchdown and launch survivability. It was necessary to do all this while simultaneously reducing the mechanism volume. Flight-like electronics utilize a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) and contain all sensor electronics and drivers on a single five inch by nine inch circuit board. Performance test results are reported including magnetic bearing and motor rotational losses...|$|R
40|$|Metastable NH* {{radicals}} in {{a molecular}} beam, generated in a discharge, {{were allowed to}} collide with target particles (He through Xe rare gas atoms, and H- 2, CO, N- 2, NO, O- 2) in a cell or a crossed jet. Optical emission was observed issuing from the collision zone (and {{in the case of}} the jet also from different points along the primary beam). Spectral analysis (similar to 0. 13 nm FWHM resolution) revealed two components; (a) a pair of sharp P, R lines ("spikes," originating from the (perturbed) level NH(A (3) Pi, v= 2, J= 5, F- 3, Lambda-component "e"; (b) broad NH(A (3) Pi [...] > X (3) Sigma(-)) emission in the (0, 0), (1, 1), and (2, 2) bands. Component (a) was shown to be due to a gateway coupling with the (perturbed) level NH(b (1) Sigma(+), v= 5, J= 5). From the collision gas pressure dependence of the "spike" intensity, relative cross sections were derived. They varied by less than a factor of 3 between He and NO. Weak spike emission was also observed issuing from the NH* beam without collisions. From the exponential decay of this "afterglow" intensity along 20 cm of the beam, the lifetime of the long-lived gateway emission component was found to be 52 mu s, with a beam speed of similar to 1220 m/s (measured using a <b>chopper</b> <b>wheel</b> and a particle multiplier detector). There is also a fast gateway component, having a (calculated) lifetime of similar to 0. 21 mu s. It is too close (similar to 1 cm(- 1)) to the slow component to be spectrally resolved and is, moreover, much weaker. The calculated branching ratio of the fast and the slow component is 1 : 247. Experimentally an upper limit of 1 : 20 was derived from simulations of the observed emission intensity profile downstream from the beam/jet crossing point. It is pointed out that only the weak, fast component of the "spike" intensity should properly be termed "gateway" emission, while the dominant, slow component is better described as being due to an "emission window" at a particular level of the otherwise dark NH(b) state. The broadband component (b) of the NH(A-X) emission is due to direct spin-changing energy transfer from (mainly) NH(a (1) Delta) to NH(A (3) Pi). Surprisingly all target gases except He were effective, although the relative cross sections varied here by a factor of 120 between Ne and NO. NH(a) was identified as the dominant reactant species from the different beam attenuation in the target cell, compared to that of NH(b) (as measured using the spike attenuation). The contours of the intense NH(A-X) bands observed with Xe, O- 2, and NO were computer-simulated, yielding high rotational "temperatures" and, with O- 2, a striking excess population of the "f" Lambda component (e:f= 1 : 5).

40|$|AbstractCurrent <b>rotary</b> blade <b>choppers</b> for {{sugarcane}} harvesting {{have the}} disadvantage of becoming clogged with leaves/cane around the rotating blades causing them to hit the ground and rocks that result in rapid blade wear and tear. Dull blades require repeated cane cutting attempts causing damage to the cane and increasing the cutting force and energy requirements. Thus, the search for alternative, non-contact, cutting options such as waterjet (WJ) cutting has been undertaken. The results indicated that WJ cutting has potential but weaknesses have also been reported. Hence, this study explored the use of abrasive fine sand (AWJ) to overcome the weaknesses of the pure WJ cutting application. Using the Hoogstrate model and a MATLAB program, AWJ cutting simulation was performed using an orifice and nozzle diameter combination of 0. 25 and 0. 76  mm at 360  MPa water pressure, respectively, which produced a water flow rate of 1. 6  L/min and a power input of 15  kW. Other parameters used in the test included: 80  mesh fine river sand abrasive materials, a specific cutting energy of 8. 7  ×  10 − 3  J/mm 3 and a fitted cutting efficiency of 0. 35. The experimental results revealed that the system was able to cut sugarcane stalks completely at a much farther standoff distance by reducing the traverse speed. The study also showed that cutting sugarcane of 30 and 120  mm diameters would require a traverse speed of 4. 4  km/h and 1. 1  km/h, respectively. The results implied that limitations should be set for sugarcane thickness for the optimum traverse speed and a standoff distance should be set {{to no more than}} 210  mm with a minimum traverse speed of 0. 6  km/h...|$|R
