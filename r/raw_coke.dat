50|$|Green coke (<b>raw</b> <b>coke)</b> is {{the primary}} solid {{carbonization}} product from high boiling hydrocarbon fractions obtained at temperatures below 900 K. It contains a fraction of matter that can be released as volatiles during subsequent heat treatment at temperatures up to approximately 1600 K. This mass fraction, called volatile matter, is {{in the case of}} green coke between 4 and 15 wt.%, but it depends also on the heating rate.|$|E
5000|$|This coke {{can either}} be fuel grade (high in sulfur and metals) or anode grade (low in sulfur and metals). The <b>raw</b> <b>coke</b> {{directly}} out of the coker {{is often referred to}} as green coke. In this context, [...] "green" [...] means unprocessed. The further processing of green coke by calcining in a rotary kiln removes residual volatile hydrocarbons from the coke. The calcined petroleum coke can be further processed in an anode baking oven in order to produce anode coke of the desired shape and physical properties. The anodes are mainly used in the aluminium and steel industry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{petroleum}} coke (refered to as PC) {{with the addition}} of FeSO 4 was obtained by impregnation method, and the reactivity of PC with CO 2 are analysed by TG. PC samples were heated from room temperature to 1300 ˚C with heating rate of 20 ˚C / min at the atmosphere of CO 2 (40 ml/min) and N 2 (60 ml/min). At the same time, FTIR spectral of the gasflowing was obtained every 30 seconds. The results show that the TG curve of <b>raw</b> petroleum <b>coke</b> begin to decline, and the CO peak in its 3 D infrared spectrogram plot has appeared at the temperature of 1100 ˚C, which proved that the <b>raw</b> petroluem <b>coke</b> (refered to as RPC) has reacted with CO 2 at 1100 ˚C. And as the FeSO 4 added amount increased,the gasification beginning temperature and initial release time of CO are all in advance,which prove that FeSO 4 can enhance the reactivity of PC carbon dioxide gasification...|$|R

40|$|M. Tech. (Chemistry) This study {{investigated}} the functionalization of coke particles and their utilization for the preparation of coke-polymer composite. Looking {{at the possibility of}} using it for the removal of lead and chromium ions from their aqueous solutions. Due to various inorganic materials in coke, it was treated with acid to demineralize the ash content. The demineralized coke was further oxidized with hydrogen peroxide to add functional groups on its surface {{as well as in the}} bulk of coke particles before coating of the polymers. The composite preparation entails modifying the surface properties of coke with hydrophilic polymers like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), poly ethylene glycol (PEG) and poly vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) followed by the crosslinking to improve the interfacial interaction between the polymer and coke to make the synthesized composite stable in water. The structural composition of coke and modified coke was examined by FT-IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, Raman Spectroscopy, thermal analysis and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. It was also observed that the modified coke samples have enhanced carbon reactivity which indicates that the non-carbon phases were removed by the treatment with acid. The adsorption studies for the removal of Pb (II) and Cr (III) ions from contaminated water was done in batch mode using variables such as pH, contact time and the initial concentration. The synthesized material was found to have better adsorption capacity as compared to <b>raw</b> <b>coke.</b> To understand the adsorption isotherm processes, Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms were applied. The monolayer adsorption capacity for the removal of lead ions was found to be 2. 41 mg/g, 2. 95 mg/g, 8. 32 mg/g, 9. 70 mg/g and 9. 84 mg/g for <b>raw</b> <b>coke,</b> acid treated coke, PVA coated coke, PEG coated coke and PVP coated coke, respectively.

Dud {{has been seen}} as the forerunner of later success by Abraham Darby and others in smelting iron with coke in the 18th century. However it remains unclear to what extent he was its technological ancestor rather than a mere precursor. For example, in the 1950s it was shown by chemical analysis that the coal that Dud Dudley used was not suitable as a <b>raw</b> material for <b>coke</b> while the coal used by Abraham Darby was suitable, leading Richard Kirby to state in 1990 that [...] "The consensus among experts is that Dudley was a wishful thinker ... and that he never did what he set out in his youth to do".|$|R
40|$|Calcined coke is a {{high quality}} carbon {{material}} produced by calcining green petroleum coke. Calcining {{is the process of}} heating green petroleum coke in a kiln to remove excess moisture, extract all remaining hydrocarbons, and modify the crystalline structure of the coke into a denser, electrically conductive product. The final product, calcined coke, is primarily used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum industry and recarburizing agent for industries such as the steel industry. If not appropriately controlled, the calcining process could lead to excess production of particulate emissions from either handling or storing of <b>raw</b> <b>coke,</b> or from the stack emissions during the production of calcined coke. Though calcined coke has shown low hazard potential in human populations due to low volatile content, there remains some public health concern regarding the emissions from these facilities. This study is designed to evaluate the emissions of petroleum coke calcining facility and assess the public health concern from the processes engaged in the handling and storage of green coke {{as well as from the}} calcining process. The ambient air levels were measured from a calcining facility and compared with the standards promulgated by USEPA. The results showed that pollutant contribution from the facility, measured by monitoring carbon fraction of the emissions, was de-minimis. The current research also studied whether the exposure levels and health risks specified in various epidemiological studies correlate with the standards promulgated by USEPA to protect public health from petrochemical emissions...|$|E
40|$|Physical and {{chemical}} properties of coke samples excavated from LKAB's Experimental Blast Furnace (EBF) at MEFOS in Lulea, Sweden were characterized. A thermal annealing study the <b>raw</b> <b>coke</b> {{used in the}} EBF was also conducted in a horizontal furnace in a neutral environment at a range of temperatures up to 1650 DGC. Carbon crystallite height of the EBF coke and of the cokes treated in the laboratory furnace were measured by XRD while mineral phases were characterized by using SEM/EDS. The CO 2 reactivity of the EBF cokes was measured by thermo-gravimetric analyser (TGA). The study demonstrated the strong effect of temperature on the modification of coke properties with special focus on carbon structure both under laboratory and experimental blast furnace conditions. The coke reactivity in the EBF was accelerated due to presence of recirculating alkalis in the coke, which increased as the coke descended in the EBF. The growth of carbon crystallite height of coke in the horizontal furnace {{was found to be}} of similar order as observed in the EBF under a similar range of temperatures. Comparison of carbon structure of laboratory treated cokes and the EBF excavated cokes indicated that carbon ordering of cokes is predominantly enhanced by the temperature rather than reacting gases or recirculating alkalis. The deterioration of coke quality such as coke strength (CSR) and abrasion propensity were related to coke graphitisation, alkalization and reactivity such that coke graphitisation was shown to have a strong impact on coke degradation behaviour. The study further implied that alkalis have a potential to influence the coke reactivity without affecting their graphitisation behaviour. The study also highlights the limitations of the CSR test for assessing the coke behaviour in an operating blast furnaces as it cannot simulate impact of graphitisation of cokes which is significant only at much higher temperatures.

40|$|High quality baked carbon anodes {{contribute}} to the optimal performance of aluminum reduction cells. However, the currently decreasing quality and increasing variability of anode <b>raw</b> materials (<b>coke</b> and pitch) make it challenging to manufacture the anodes with consistent overall quality. Intercepting faulty anodes (e. g., presence of cracks and pores) before they are set in reduction cells and deteriorate their performance is therefore important. This is a difficult task, even in modern and well-instrumented anode plants, because lab testing using core samples can only characterize {{a small proportion of}} the anode production due to the costly, time-consuming, and destructive nature of the analytical methods. In addition, these results are not necessarily representative of the whole anode block. The objective of this work is to develop a rapid and non-destructive method for quality control of baked anodes using acousto-ultrasonic (AU) techniques. The acoustic responses of anode samples (sliced sections) were analyzed using a combination of temporal features computed from AU signals and principal component analysis (PCA). The AU signals were found sensitive to pores and cracks and were able to discriminate the two types of defects. The results were validated qualitatively by submitting the samples to X-ray Computed Tomography (CT scan) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{aluminium}} electrolysis cells the anodic {{process is}} associated with a substantial overpotential. Industrial carbon anodes are produced from a blend of coke materials, but the effect of coke type on anodic overpotential has not been well studied. In this work, lab-scale anodes were fabricated from single cokes and electrochemical methods were subsequently used to determine the overpotential trend of the anode materials. Attempts were then made to explain these trends in terms of both the physical and chemical characteristics of the baked anodes themselves and their <b>raw</b> materials. Routine <b>coke</b> and anode characterisation methods were used to measure properties such as impurity concentrations and reactivity (to air and CO 2), while non-routine characterisation methods were applied to study other surface and structural properties. It was found that the overpotential trend of the anodes correlated well with many of the properties studied, and explanations for these observed correlations are suggested. These findings offer exciting possibilities for reducing the energy demand of the anodic process...|$|R
40|$|MgAl 2 O 4 –W {{composite}} was synthesized by aluminothermic reducing method using Al, WO 3, MgO and corundum as <b>raw</b> materials under <b>coke</b> protection. The {{effects of}} temperature, content of corundum on {{the synthesis of}} MgAl 2 O 4 –W composite and lattice parameter of spinel has been discussed. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric (TG) analysis indicated that spinel began to form at 1058. 2 °C without corundum and shifted to 1120. 7 °C with 0. 8 mol of corundum. The XRD analysis confirmed that spinel and tungsten are the main phases under coke protection. Alumina rich spinel with a high solubility of alumina was easily formed {{because of the high}} exothermic heats. The solubility limit of Al 2 O 3 in spinel is reached when corundum content is 2. 1 mol. Furthermore, the calculated lattice parameter of spinel increases with the increment of added corundum content and rising of temperature. Microstructural observation indicates that cubic tungsten located at grain boundaries of well crystallized spinel. Residual WO 3 has needle like morphology...|$|R
40|$|Industrialization and {{urbanization}} are the {{two sources}} of chemical agents which cause environmental degradation. Industrialization has rapidly developed, which plays both a beneficial and harmful role in the environment. Coimbatore is a major industrial city in Tamilnadu. There are about 450 foundries, 300 motor manufacturing units, 200 wet grinder manufacturing units, about 300 brick clines and 210 textile dyeing and bleaching units in operation. In Coimbatore, as in other Indian cities, there is no separate zone for industrial/commercial activities. Therefore, some industries are located in residential areas. Urbanization, industrialization and associated increases in automobile vehicular activities result in severe pollution problems, which is a major health concern. Hence the study was undertaken to estimate the pollutants released from the foundries and its contribution on the Coimbatore environment. About 17 foundries were selected randomly and studied for various polluting parameters by adopting CPCB methods. The result of {{this study showed that}} there is no wastewater from the process of the unit, the ambient and stack analysis results of SO 2 NOx, SPM are under the limits as per the CPCB. The released SO 2 depends {{on the quality of the}} <b>raw</b> materials and <b>coke.</b> Most of the solid waste is reused, and only slag is the solid waste, which is non-hazardous. Even though all the air pollutant released from foundries are within the limits, the industrial location and increase in number of industries year by year in Coimbatore may be adding up to the load of impact on human health. Hence the study concludes that there should be a separate zone for the industrial sector...|$|R
40|$|The carbon anode, used in {{aluminum}} electrolysis (Hall–Héroult process), is over-consumed by air oxidation and carboxy-reaction (with CO 2). Several anode features may affect this over-consumption, such as impurity content, graphitization level and anode porosity features (e. g., porosity volume fraction or pore size distribution). The two first parameters are basically {{related to the}} quality of <b>raw</b> materials and <b>coke</b> calcination conditions. Anode porosity is, however, greatly affected by anode manufacturing conditions, and is possible to be modified, to some extent, by adjusting the anode recipe and the processing parameters. This work aims to investigate the effect of anode porosity on its air reactivity. Baked anode samples were prepared in laboratory scale and then crushed into powder form (− 4760 + 4000 µm). The recipe for anode preparation was similar to a typical industrial recipe, except that in the lab scale no butt particles were used in the recipe. Anode particles were then gasified at six different conversion levels (0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 50 wt %) under air at 525 °C. The porosity was characterized in several pore size ranges, measured by nitrogen adsorption and mercury intrusion (0. 0014 – 0. 020, 0. 002 – 0. 025, 0. 025 – 0. 100, 0. 1 – 40. 0 and superior at 40 µm). The volume variation of each pore range, as a function of carbon conversion, was assessed and used to determine the size of the most active pores for air oxidation. The most active pore size was found to be the pores inferior at 40 µm before 15 wt % of gasification and pores superior at 40 µm between 15 and 50 wt % of carbon conversion. Limitation of pore size range could be used as an additional guideline, along with other targets such as high homogeneity and density, to set the optimum anode manufacturing parameters...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the pollution extent of metals and nonmetals {{inside and outside the}} ferrosilicon production factory in Edfu, Aswan, Egypt, <b>raw</b> materials (quartz, <b>cokes,</b> iron oxides), ferrosilicon alloy, silica fume, dust and suspended dust (at different sites) samples were collected from the factory, and fallen dust samples were collected from outside the factory, horizontally (at different sites and different distance and directions) and vertically (at different floors in the selected buildings). Gravimetric methods, X-ray fluorescence (XRF), flame photometer, wide range carbon determinator and atomic absorption spectroscopy tools were used for elements determination. The results indicating that the fallen dust and its element contents on southern factory walls being higher than those on eastern factory walls {{may be due to the}} nature of the dusts and effects of wind force and wind direction. Fallen dust levels in different regions outside the factory were found to be affected by the distance, direction and floors. The nature of dust samples was affected by gravity and the suspended dust in different factory units depended on the work capacity and method of handling materials by personnel in different production units. Silica fume was a complicated problem, had dangerous effect against the workers’ health, and was characterized by high concentrations of SiO 2 (90. 6 %~ 93. 6 %) and heavy metals (Mn, 420. 6 × 10 − 6 ~ 520. 3 × 10 − 6; Fe, 2354 × 10 − 6 ~ 2685 × 10 − 6; Co, 80. 7 × 10 − 6 ~ 101. 6 × 10 − 6 and Ni, 5. 3 × 10 − 6 ~ 6. 05 × 10 − 6). The TSP (Total Suspended Particulate) levels in all factory units were higher than the recommended air quality value (70 μg/m 3) under Egyptian law. The effect of ferrosilicon factory fallen dust on the surrounding regions decreased with increasing distance between the factory and these regions. The suspended dust samples in the factory units and their components greatly exceeded national and international standards, so health and environmental criteria must be enforced on these units...|$|R
