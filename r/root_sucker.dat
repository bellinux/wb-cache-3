This study was carried out on the densities of natural root suckers of S. birrea in three areas (reserved forests, mature and new fallows), as well as on particular characteristics of these root suckers. This up to date study shows that the amount of root suckers in the mature fallows (34. 28 ± 22. 28 root suckers / ha) is significantly superior (p = 0. 005) to those of the new fallows (12. 36 ± 7. 98 root suckers / ha). 41. 1 % of mature S. birrea produces some, and more than 70 % of the mature ones, which <b>root</b> <b>sucker,</b> have 1 to 3 suckers. Half of the root suckers are carried by roots with a diameter between 2 and 4 cm. Under the crown of the mother plants, we can count 41 % of the root suckers, whereas the rest grow in the full light.

40|$|American beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) reproduces sexually, and vegetatively by <b>root</b> <b>suckers.</b> Although {{many studies}} have {{investigated}} its regeneration response, most did not account for differences that may exist between its two modes of reproduction. This study was performed in an old-growth Acer - Fagus forest in southern Quebec, where beech bark disease had only a minor effect {{at the time of}} the study. We compared the density and frequency of occurrence of beech seedlings and <b>root</b> <b>suckers</b> (height < 30 cm), as well as their morphology, growth, survival, and response to experimental defoliation. <b>Root</b> <b>suckers</b> accounted for ∼ 13 % of beech regeneration at our site. Density and frequency of occurrence were greater for seedlings than suckers, but did not vary with light availability, which was low at our study site (mean: 2. 9 %). Seedlings and suckers did not differ in leaf characteristics, but several differences were observed in terms of plant morphology, growth, and survival. <b>Root</b> <b>suckers</b> showed more lateral growth than height growth, and had a lower leaf area index than seedlings. <b>Root</b> <b>suckers</b> had both a greater growth in height and diameter, and a higher survivorship than seedlings (height and diameter growth were, respectively, five and two times greater for suckers than seedlings, and 74 % of suckers survived more than 1 year, compared to 52 % for seedlings). Defoliation treatments, which included levels of defoliation of 50 % and 100 % (1) did not affect current-year extension growth of seedlings and suckers; (2) did not affect seedling diameter growth, but had a negative impact on sucker diameter growth; and (3) affected survivorship for both origins, but had a much greater negative impact on seedling survivorship (none of the completely defoliated seedlings survived over one year, while 55 % of the suckers did). This study showed that several differences exist between small beech seedlings and <b>root</b> <b>suckers</b> in traits that are important determinants of a species' competitive ability. We therefore expect that variation in the relative importance of <b>root</b> <b>suckering</b> among sites might have several community-level implications...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to examine whether the method of micropropagation and tissue source affects the early growth and development of Paulownia {{in the first six months}} following transfer from tissue culture and establishment in soil. This tree species was chosen as it is a fast growing, short-rotation timber tree and able to adapt successfully to new environments. It is easily established in vitro and has been micropropagated using a range of different techniques. Three methods of micropropagation were chosen: callus regeneration, somatic embryogenesis and the third method was inducing root suckers in vitro. The third method was developed during this study and has never been documented in other research. Newly established explants and stabilised explants that had been in culture for over 6 months were used to test the efficacy of these methods. Genotype was also another important aspect to examine, as clones of the same species have shown differing response to being micropropagated. Previous studies have not compared different methods of micropropagation and rarely past the initial stages of laboratory experiments to fully determine the influence they have on the explants development ex vitro. Cultures were sourced from five clones (P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4, P 5) of mature Paulownia elongata x fortunei stock plants. P 1 was first established in vitro and had been micropropagated for five years to induce stabilisation. Newly established explants from clones P 1, P 2, P 3, P 4 and P 5 had been established in culture for three months before being utilised for micropropagation analysis experiments. Examination of these methods in vitro showed that tissue sources from P 1 were the easiest to manipulate and propagate in vitro. Callus regeneration was the most successful in its ability to produce explants and in large quantities. Initial callus experiments showed a significant response in shoot regeneration from stabilised cultures. Subsequent experiments showed a greater response from greenhouse material and newly established cultures, while stabilised cultures failed to produce shoots. <b>Root</b> <b>sucker</b> induction was also successful in stabilised and newly established clones of P 1, however, it took a significant amount of time to induce root suckers and the quantity of material produced was limited. Somatic embryogenesis was unsuccessful in regenerating new shoots and the complexity of current methods made it difficult to develop a full protocol in this study. Explants produced from callus regeneration and <b>root</b> <b>sucker</b> induction were transferred to the greenhouse, along with controls from stabilised and newly established cultures. All sources readily produced adventitious roots and there was a 100 % survival rate upon transfer to the greenhouse. While initial comparisons showed slight variations in growth factors such as height and floral development, these were not statistically significant. Any slight variation became indistinguishable after two months of growth. Most importantly, after six months, plants from all sources readily produced flowers, indicating that the explants retained the mature phenology of the parent material while being maintained in culture. While callus regeneration and <b>root</b> <b>sucker</b> induction were successful in producing new explants in vitro, these methods had no effect on the overall growth and development under greenhouse conditions. All explants exhibited early flowering, which indicates that they maintained the mature characteristics of the parent material. This is not necessarily an undesirable outcome if the intention is to micropropagate mature tissue while still retaining their mature phenology. Ultimately, the method of micropropagation utilised is determined by what growth characteristic is desired and the purpose for which the plants are being propagated...|$|E
30|$|Xyloglucan {{is thought}} to be a key {{hemicellulose}} cross-linking adjacent cellulose microfibrils in plant cell walls. The growth traits of transgenic poplars (Populus alba) with decreased xyloglucan from overexpression of Aspergillus aculeatus xyloglucanase were characterized during a 4 -year field trial. The field-trial site consisted of two blocks, a fertile soil block and a non-fertile soil block, determined by soil analysis. In the fertile block, the growth of aboveground biomass of the transgenic poplars was reduced to 24 – 44  % compared to that of wild-type poplars, in contrast to the growth seen in chamber and greenhouse conditions. In the non-fertile block, the aboveground biomass of transgenic poplars was also smaller than that of the wild-type poplars. Because poplars reproduce asexually by <b>root</b> <b>suckers,</b> we also compared the formation of <b>root</b> <b>suckers</b> from transgenic and wild-type poplars. <b>Root</b> <b>suckers</b> formed less frequently from transgenic poplars than from wild-type poplars. The growth rates of <b>root</b> <b>suckers</b> from transgenic poplars were also slower than those from wild-type poplars.

30|$|In a 4 -year field trial, we {{evaluated}} growth characteristics of transgenic poplars with decreased xyloglucan from overexpression of AaXEG 2. The field trial {{showed that the}} aboveground biomass of transgenic poplars was reduced by constitutive overexpression of AaXEG 2, {{in contrast to the}} growth chamber and greenhouse conditions in which smaller poplar plants were grown in pots with sufficient moisture and nutrients. In addition to biomass reduction, <b>root</b> <b>sucker</b> formation and growth was reduced in transgenic poplar lines. It is known that a knockout Arabidopsis mutant with altered xyloglucan biosynthesis disrupts root hair growth [21]. Leaves of the transgenic poplars are smaller and greener than those of wild-type poplars [9]. Disturbed root hairs and abnormal leaves might be associated with reduced growth of transgenic poplars in the field. Distinct expression of xyloglucanase in stems or xylem by a specific promoter will not disrupt root hair growth and not affect leaf morphology. Consequently, there will be no interruption of growth traits, and improved xylem suitable for pulping and saccharification can be expected.|$|E
40|$|In Newfoundland, {{stands of}} {{trembling}} aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) are relatively common {{only in the}} north-central part of the Island, where the average annual rainfall is less than 50 inches and the mean July temperature exceeds 60 F. Most stands are found on fresh, sandy-loam till sites, where conditions are generally favorable to <b>root</b> <b>sucker</b> development.

Trembling aspen is considered to have great potential for commercial utilization in view of the expected increases in the demand for wood on the Island. However, the acreage of aspen stands on suitable forest sites, of which there are estimated to be more than 1 million acres within the most favorable climatic zone, must be increased considerably through such techniques as clear-cutting, prescribed burning, and scarification before commercial operations can become feasible...|$|E

Ideaeus) based on AFLPs, genomic-SSR and EST-SSR markers. Theoretical and Applied Genetics 109 (4), 740 - 749. Breeding in raspberry is time-consuming due to the highly heterozygous nature of this perennial fruit crop, coupled with relatively long periods of juvenility. The speed and precision of raspberry breeding can be improved by genetic linkage maps, thus facilitating the development of diagnostic markers for polygenic traits and the identification of genes controlling complex phenotypes. A genetic linkage map (789 cM) of the red raspberry Rubus idaeus has been constructed from a cross between two phenotypically different cultivars; the recent European cultivar Glen Moy and the older North American cultivar Latham. SSR markers were developed from both genomic and cDNA libraries from Glen Moy. These SSRs, together with AFLP markers, were utilised to create a linkage map. In order to test {{the utility of the}} genetic linkage map for QTL analysis, morphological data based on easily scoreable phenotypic traits were collected. The segregation of cane spininess, and the <b>root</b> <b>sucker</b> traits of density and spread from the mother plant, was quantified in two different environments.

40|$|Oriental {{bittersweet}} (Celastrus orbiculatus) is an introduced liana (woody vine) {{that has}} invaded {{much of the}} Eastern United States and is expanding west into the Great Plains. In forests, it can girdle and damage canopy trees. At Indiana Dunes, we have discovered that it is invading non-forested dune habitats as well. Anecdotal evidence suggests that fire might facilitate its spread, but the relationship between fire and this aggressive invader is poorly understood. We investigated four areas important to fire management of oriental bittersweet, each of which we will briefly summarize here. 1) What fire temperatures cause seed mortality? For seeds, temperatures above 140 °C for three minute or more kills the embryo. For fruits, temperatures above 140 °C kill the seeds inside after five minutes. While oriental bittersweet fruits ripen in October and November, the seeds are not dispersed until later {{in the early to}} mid December. Thus fall fires will not have any impact on the seeds unless perhaps if they are near the ground. Late winter and early spring fires are likely to kill seeds in the top litter at least. Thus spring fire can reduce the pool of seeds available to germinate. 2) Does fire modify habitat susceptibility to invasion? We found that post fire environment had no effect on the emergence and survival of oriental bittersweet, except that the tallest plants, after two years since sowing, were in the control plots. Highest establishment occurred in mesic silt loam prairie and oak forest. Survival was greatest in mesic prairie and greatest biomass occurred in the oak forest. 3) Both fire and cutting can cause oriental bittersweet to resprout and <b>root</b> <b>sucker.</b> Does the resprouting response differ between these two treatments and can a combination of cutting and pre- or post-fire treatment facilitate its removal? Cutting sometimes increased stem density between one and two times, but burning increased density by two or more times depending on the maximum fire temperature and duration. Cutting in early July reduced total nonstructural carbohydrates by 50 % from normal July levels and 75 % below dormant season levels. Thus burning established populations will only serve to increase their local density. 4) How does oriental bittersweet abundance vary with fire regime and can we predict the abundance of this species in a fire mosaic landscape based on fire return interval and time since last fire? At the landscape scale, we can predict the presence and abundance of oriental bittersweet, but have less success predicting its cover and distribution. The presence of oriental bittersweet was significantly negatively influenced by canopy closure, burn frequency, and distance to roads and railroads. In plots where C. orbiculatus was present, abundance was significantly greater in plots with low to moderate burn frequency, and marginally (p = 0. 056) lower in plots with greater canopy cover. Both cover and distribution of C. orbiculatus was not significantly affected by the measured variables. These results suggest the frequent fire may be effective in preventing the establishment of oriental bittersweet...|$|E
40|$|Elm suckers {{developed}} from root buds and/or bud primordia formed on root surfaces, and originated from pericyclic tissues beneath the periderm, {{and are therefore}} of endogenous origin. Elm <b>root</b> <b>sucker</b> formation was an auxin mediated process, and {{was related to the}} level of endogenous auxin at that particular time. Root segments suckered most in spring and least in autumn. Application of exogenous anti-auxin and cytokinin stimulated sucker formation from root segments in autumn, and application of auxin or growth inhibitors suppressed sucker formation in spring. The elongation rate of root suckers of elms decreased as the soil dried out and the soil penetrometer resistance increased. The effect of the soil drying out on increasing the soil penetrometer resistance was not in itself sufficient to account for the reduction in elongation rate as the soil dried. It was suggested that the reduction in soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (and the consequent reduced water uptake by the sucker) as the soil dried out was an additional reason for the reduced elongation rate. The osmotic potential of root suckers decreased as the soil dried out and as soil penetrometer resistance increased. In this instance, the effect of the soil drying out on increasing the soil penetrometer resistance was sufficient in itself to account for the reduction in osmotic potential (osmoregulation). As a consequence of this osmoregulation, turgor pressure either increased or was maintained at a constant value as the soil dried and as the soil penetrometer resistance was increased. The soil penetrometer resistance was found to be three times the value of the soil mechanical resistance to sucker growth. The net growth pressure (turgor pressure less soil mechanical resistance) decreased with soil penetrometer resistance. Sucker elongation rate increased with net growth pressure, but sucker elongation rate also increased with soil water content at constant net growth pressure. Elongation rate increased with time. Osmotic potential decreased; and turgor pressure and net growth pressure increased with time. The rate of decrease in osmotic potential and the rate of increase in turgor pressure and net growth pressure increased with soil penetrometer resistance, but this effect became less over time. The data suggest that elm root suckers can osmoregulate over time to reach a minimum value of osmotic potential (or maximum value of turgor pressure) which is independent of soil penetrometer resistance, but that the rate at which this minimum osmotic potential (maximum turgor pressure) is achieved increases with soil penetrometer resistance. Elm sucker elongation rate increased as the axis of elongation approached the geotropically preferred axis, ie the vertical upright position. Elm suckers exerted a maximum growth pressure of 0. 63 MPa (SE= 0. 057) in a critical time of 5 to 6 days. Elm suckers exerted a buckling pressure of 0. 34 MPa (SE= 0. 052) in a critical time of 24 to 30 hours. Elm suckers could not detect cracks or holes in a compacted soil by remote-sensing (ie no trematotropism in suckers). Root buds if pre-exposed to cracks had a better chance to develop into suckers than root buds not pre-exposed. Suckers preferentially selected growth pathways in the vertical upright direction provided no pores wider than 2 mm existed in its way. If there were pores wider than 2 mm diameter existed in its way, the sucker abandoned its vertical growth path preference and selected the wider pores instead even though the wider pores were set at an angle from the vertical.
