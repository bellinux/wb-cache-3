500|$|In New Mexico, they {{obtained}} false identification, {{and purchased}} several pistols. Their {{intention was to}} purchase guns which were difficult to trace. Caldwell said {{it was easy to}} obtain guns in New Mexico: [...] "we found it was pretty easy to buy guns. All {{you had to do was}} show some identification and it was easy to get." [...] Caldwell said she and Stork went to a university library to find the identity [...] "of someone dying very young", next went [...] "to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate" [...] and described how [...] "we got a rent <b>receipt</b> <b>book</b> and just made up a rent receipt". [...] "And then we were able to go to several different gun shops in Albuquerque with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets," [...] said Caldwell. They were able to obtain one Colt [...]38-caliber revolver, and four Ruger [...]357-caliber Security-Six Magnum revolvers. The conspirators smuggled the guns into Oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a Greyhound Lines bus. Caldwell said that she and Stork traveled by bus back to the Rajneesh commune so as to avoid airport metal detectors.|$|E

60|$|While {{the cooking}} mania lasted {{she went through}} Mrs. Cornelius's <b>Receipt</b> <b>Book</b> {{as if it were}} a {{mathematical}} exercise, working out the problems with patience and care. Sometimes her family were invited in to help eat up a too bounteous feast of successes, or Lotty would be privately dispatched with a batch of failures, which were to be concealed from all eyes in the convenient stomachs of the little Hummels. An evening with John over the account books usually produced a temporary lull in the culinary enthusiasm, and a frugal fit would ensue, during which the poor man was put through a course of bread pudding, hash, and warmed-over coffee, which tried his soul, although he bore it with praiseworthy fortitude. Before the golden mean was found, however, Meg added to her domestic possessions what young couples seldom get on long without, a family jar.|$|E
6000|$|It did {{not strike}} me that {{pleasure}} {{might be good}} for Jaquetta, or that Fulk's stern silent sorrow might have been lightened by variety. Used {{as he had been}} to political life and London society, it was no small change to have merely the market for interest, the farm for occupation, and no society but ourselves; no newspaper but the County Chronicle once a week; no new books, for Mudie did not exist then, even if we could have afforded it. We had dropped out of the guinea country book club, and Knight's [...] "Penny Magazine" [...] was our only fresh literature. However, Jaquetta never was much of a reader, and was full of business--queen of the poultry, and running after the weakly ones half the day, supplementing George Sisson's very inadequate gardening--aye, and his wife's equally rough cooking. She found a <b>receipt</b> <b>book,</b> and turned out excellent dishes. She could not bear, she said, to see Fulk try to eat grease, and with an effort at concealment, assisted by the dogs, fall back upon bread and cheese.|$|E

Alchemy in the Poetry of Hester Pulter', Literature Compass (2005) 2 (1) pp. 1 - 14 RAE 2008 Relatively {{little is}} known about women's {{knowledge}} of natural philosophy in early modern England. Manuscript and printed <b>receipt</b> <b>books</b> show that women, by virtue of their work in the household, were experts in the alchemical processes of sublimation, fermentation, calcination and distillation. The poetry of Hester Pulter (1596 ? 1678) is remarkable for a sophisticated use of terms, images and conceits drawn from alchemy. As such, it provides important evidence of one woman's imaginative and intellectual engagements with the experimental, esoteric and emblematic traditions in alchemy. Paying particular attention to a cycle of poems entitled 'The Circle', I show how Pulter tirelessly worked and reworked alchemical concepts and images, and, just like an alchemist, transformed them into something new.
