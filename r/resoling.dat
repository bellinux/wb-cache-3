6000|$|I {{went through}} one of these bakeries, almost as large as an {{automobile}} factory, fragrant with the aroma of two hundred thousand loaves of bread. This bakery alone sends every day to the trenches two hundred thousand loaves made from the wheat of western Canada! Of all sights {{to be seen in}} this place, however, the reclamation [...] "plant" [...] is the most wonderful. It covers acres. Everything which is broken in war, from a pair of officer's field-glasses to a nine-inch howitzer carriage is mended here--if it can be mended. Here, when a battle-field is cleared, every article that can possibly be used again is brought; and the manager pointed with pride to the furnaces in his power-house, which formerly burned coal and now are fed with refuse--broken wheels of gun-carriages, sawdust, and even old shoes. Hundreds of French girls and even German prisoners are <b>resoling</b> and patching shoes with the aid of American machinery, and even the uppers of such as are otherwise hopeless are cut in spirals into laces. Tunics, breeches, and overcoats are mended by tailors; rusty camp cookers are retinned, and in the foundries the precious scraps of cast iron are melted into braziers to keep Tommy in the trenches warm. In the machine-shops the injured guns and cannon are repaired. German prisoners are working there, too. At a distance, in their homely grey tunics, with their bullet-shaped heads close-cropped and the hairs standing out like the needles of a cylinder of a music-box, they had the appearance of hard citizens who had become rather sullen convicts. Some wore spectacles. A closer view revealed that most of them were contented, and some actually cheerful. None, indeed, seemed more cheerful than a recently captured group I saw later, who were actually building the barbed-wire fence that was to confine them.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{new insights}} in the <b>resole</b> crosslinking chemistry of thermoplastic vulcanisates (TPVs) {{and in the}} production of TPVs on extruders. Low-molecular-weight olefins were used in combination with EPDM crosslinking experiments to investigate the <b>resole</b> crosslinking chemistry. The fact that enhanced substitution of the olefin/EPDM unsaturation enhances the reactivity towards the <b>resole</b> strongly supports the cationic character of SnCl 2 -activated <b>resole</b> crosslinking. Samples were collected along the extruder during TPV preparation to study the physico-chemical phenomena during compounding. It was observed that crosslinking of the EPDM phase takes place even when the PE phase is not yet fully molten. Upon complete melting of the PE phase the blend very quickly reaches its final morphology.

40|$|High ortho <b>resole</b> resin was {{prepared}} by condensation of phenol with excess of formaldehyde {{in the presence}} of magnesium oxide as catalyst. Reaction of furfuraldehyde with acetone in basic medium led to difurfurylidene acetone (DFA). Their interpenetrating polymer network (IPNS) were obtained by the reaction of predetermined quantities of difurfurylidene acetone and high ortho <b>resole</b> using p-toluene sulphonic acid (PTSA) as curing agent. The thermal behavior of the resins was studied using thermogravimetry (TG) under ambient and nitrogen atmospheres over a temperature range of (25 - 1000 C º). It was observed that the IPN of 20 % DFA – 80 % <b>resole</b> has higher thermal stability than that of <b>resole</b> alone and the decomposition temperature was higher by 80 C º. This behavior was attributed to highly cross linked structure and thermally stable backbone of ploy difurfurylidene acetone due to formation of ladder structure.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{co-curing}} blends of an unsaturated polyester (UP) with inherently fire-retardant and char-forming phenolic <b>resoles</b> (PH) on the thermal stability and fire retardancy {{of the resulting}} resins have been investigated. To overcome the challenge of UP/PH incompatibility, arising from their different chemical structures and curing mechanisms (radical vs. condensation), different phenolic <b>resoles</b> have been used: ethanol-soluble, epoxy-functionalized, and allyl-functionalized. A traditional water-based <b>resole</b> has also been used to give a reference non-compatible system. In Part 1 of this series of publications it was shown that the compatibility of the two resins increases with functionalization; the allyl-functionalized <b>resole</b> showing the best compatibility with UP. Limiting oxygen index measurements and cone calorimetry have shown that fire performance of the functionalized PH resins and their blends with UP is worse than that from the unfunctionalized PH resin, but still significantly better {{than that of the}} UP. To understand this behaviour, thermal analyses coupled with infrared spectroscopy of volatile degradation products have been used on all resins and their blends, based on which, mechanisms of their decomposition and interactions are proposed, and the effects of these on flammability are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{bio-based}} bio-phenol-formaldehyde (BPF) <b>resoles</b> were prepared using hydrolytically depolymerized Kraft lignin (DKL) as bio-phenol to partially substitute phenol. The effects of phenol substitution ratio, weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of DKL and formaldehyde-to-phenol (F/P) ratio {{were also investigated}} to find the optimum curing temperature for BPF <b>resoles.</b> The results indicated that DKL with Mw ~ 1200 g/mol provides a curing temperature of less than 180 °C for any substitution level, provided that F/P ratios are controlled. Incorporation of lignin reduced the curing temperature of the resin, however, higher Mw DKL negatively affected the curing process. For any level of lignin Mw, the curing temperature was found to increase with lower F/P ratios at lower phenol substitution levels. At 25 % and 50 % phenol substitution, increasing the F/P ratio allows for synthesis of <b>resoles</b> with lower curing temperatures.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{was made in}} order to evaluate the interfacial characteristics of treated aramid fibres and epoxy resins.

The flexural properties of these specimens were determined and the results were discussed taking into consideration the surface characteristics of the modified fibres, as derived from pull-out tests and contact angle measurements. It was shown that both coatings are adequate to promote interfacial adhesive bonding to epoxy matrices due to the chemical reactivity of phenolic resins to the epoxy matrix as well as to their affinity with the aramid fibre surface. <b>Resole</b> appeared more efficient than novolac as it produces uniform continuous films, shows increased reactivity due to its higher hydroxyl content and can be easily processed because it is soluble in alkaline water solutions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Resole</b> {{phenolic}} resins were modified by forming copolymers with Cardanol, {{which is the}} main component of Cashew nut shell liquid (CNSL). The modified {{phenolic resins}} were prepared at various mole ratios of phenol to cardanol and the polymerization was carried out under basic conditions.

The effect of replacement of phenol by Cardanol on the thermal and mechanical properties of <b>resole</b> resins was experimentally investigated. An increases in the content of Cardanol resulted in a proportional increases in flexibility and the fracture toughness together with a decreases in the flexural modulus of the cured resins. The higher toughening effect of replacing phenol with Cardanol was obtained with the total Phenol:Formaldehyde ratio of 1. 0 : 1. 25 in the synthesis of the resin.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{addressed}} the blending and cocuring of <b>resole</b> and epoxy, using NaOH and 4, 49 -diaminodiphenylmethane as curing agents. IR band shifts regarding the molecular interactions were investigated with FTIR. Exothermic peak shifts during cocur-ing reactions were studied with dynamic DSC.

Experimental results revealed that the molecular interactions between <b>resole</b> and epoxy resulted in good compatibility {{as shown by the}} single damping peak in the RDS curve and the single glass transition for each cocured sample. Also apparent were accelerated curing rates, leading to shifts of the exothermic peaks to lower temperature and faster viscosity increases.

40|$|This work {{builds on}} our {{previous}} experience of blending and co-curing an unsaturated polyester resin with other relatively inexpensive, but more flame retardant resins such as chemically modified phenolic resins, and extends this {{technology to the}} almost equally flammable vinyl ester resins, commonly used in marine composites. It has been demonstrated that two commercial vinyl ester resins (Scott-Bader, UK), one epoxy based (Crystic VE 676) and the other novolac based (Crystic VE 673), may be blended with two different commercial low molecular weight phenolic <b>resoles</b> (Sumitomo Bakelite Europe NV), one unmodified (Durez 33156) and the other containing allyl groups (Methylon 75108) and the blends cured (crosslinked) to give blended resins with good flame retardance, in several respects better {{than that of the}} unblended vinyl ester resins. Compatibility of the vinyl esters with the Methylon <b>resole</b> is however better than with the Durez, which tends to give phase-separated blends, and thus blends having poor physical and mechanical properties. Moreover, the compatibility of the novolac-based VE with both Durez and Methylon is worse than blends of the unsaturated polyester with Methylon and Durez. This compatibility issue and derived flammability properties of different blends are discussed in terms of their chemical structures...|$|R
