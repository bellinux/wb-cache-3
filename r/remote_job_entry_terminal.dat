50|$|Service in Informatics and Analysis (SIA Ltd.) {{was one of}} the {{pioneering}} time-sharing service bureau companies in the late 1960s, later known as SIA Computer Services. Its head office was located at Lower Belgrave Street, close to Victoria Station in London, and the company had branch offices in Edinburgh, Manchester, the West End, Paris and (much later) in Hong Kong. SIA offered terminal services via the Post Office telephone network at speeds of 10, 15, 30, 60 and 120 characters per second for Teletype-style terminals and of 1200 baud, 2400 baud and 4800 baud for <b>Remote</b> <b>Job</b> <b>Entry</b> <b>terminals.</b> Later with the release of the IBM PC, systems were developed to emulate the Remote Batch and interactive terminals.Clients could also visit the head or branch offices to submit their jobs personally or have them accepted and supervised by the production department.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} purpose of Bisync was for batch communications between a System/360 mainframe and another mainframe or a <b>Remote</b> <b>Job</b> <b>Entry</b> (RJE) <b>terminal</b> {{such as the}} IBM 2780 or IBM 3780. The RJE terminals support {{a limited number of}} data formats: punched card images in and out and print line images to the terminal. Some non-IBM hardware vendors such as Mohawk Data Sciences used Bisync for other purposes such as tape-to-tape transmission. A programmer can easily emulate an RJE terminal or other device.|$|R
50|$|The system {{supported}} synchronous {{communications at}} up to 9600 baud, and usually served as a <b>remote</b> <b>job</b> <b>entry</b> system to a larger mainframe computer. The <b>remote</b> <b>job</b> <b>entry</b> software provided full support for the HASP multi-leaving protocol, among others.|$|R

50|$|HASP {{bypassed}} most {{operating system}} services with code specially tailored for efficiency. HASP operated {{as a single}} operating system task and used cooperative multitasking internally to run processors to perform tasks such as running card readers, printers, and punches, managing the spool files, communicating with the system operator, and driving multiple communication lines for <b>remote</b> <b>job</b> <b>entry.</b>|$|R
50|$|HASP was {{developed}} by IBM Federal Systems Division contractors at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. The developers were Tom Simpson and Bob Crabtree. HASP was a program that ran on a mainframe, and performed functions such as: scheduling, control of job flow, spooling and printing/punching. HASP had no support for IBM System/360 Operating System <b>Remote</b> <b>Job</b> <b>Entry,</b> 360S-RC-536, but provided roughly equivalent facilities of its own.|$|R

50|$|Initially MVS was {{supplied}} {{with a job}} queue manager called JES2 (<b>Job</b> <b>Entry</b> Subsystem 2), which was descended from HASP (Houston Automatic Spooling Priority) and also supported <b>Remote</b> <b>Job</b> <b>Entry</b> from workstations located elsewhere. JES2 can only manage jobs for one CPU (which might be a tightly coupled multiprocessor system). In 1976 IBM provided another option, JES3 (<b>Job</b> <b>Entry</b> Subsystem 3), a descendant of ASP (Attached Support Processor), which allows one CPU to manage a single job queue feeding work to several physically distinct CPUs, and therefore allows one operator's console to manage the work of all those CPUs. Note: JES1 was the job queue manager for OS/VS1 (see above).|$|R
50|$|The 7/32 and 8/32 {{became the}} {{computers}} {{of choice in}} large scale embedded systems, such as FFT machines used in real-time seismic analysis, CAT scanners, and flight simulator systems. They were also often used as non-IBM peripherals in IBM networks, serving the role of HASP workstations and spooling systems, so called RJE (<b>Remote</b> <b>Job</b> <b>Entry)</b> stations. For example, the computers behind the first Space Shuttle simulator consisted of thirty-six 32-bit minis inputing and/or outputting data to networked mainframe computers (both IBM and Univac), all in real-time.|$|R
50|$|QTAM was {{announced}} by IBM in 1965 {{as part of}} OS/360 and DOS/360 aimed at inquiry and data collection. As announced it also supported <b>remote</b> <b>job</b> <b>entry</b> (RJE) applications, called job processing, which was dropped by 1968. Originally QTAM supported the IBM 1030 Data Collection System, IBM 1050 Data Communications System, the IBM 1060 Data Communications System, AT&T 83B2 Selective Calling Stations, Western Union Plan 115A Outstations, and AT&T Teletype Model 33 or 35 Teletypewriters.
