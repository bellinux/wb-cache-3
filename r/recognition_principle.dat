50|$|The revenue <b>recognition</b> <b>principle</b> is a {{cornerstone}} of accrual accounting together with the matching principle. They both determine the accounting period, in which revenues and expenses are recognized. According to the principle, revenues are recognized when they are realized or realizable, and are earned (usually when goods are transferred or services rendered), no matter when cash is received. In cash accounting - in contrast - revenues are recognized when cash is received no matter when goods or services are sold.|$|E
50|$|Deferrals are the {{consequence}} of the revenue <b>recognition</b> <b>principle</b> which dictates that revenues be recognized in {{the period in which}} they occur, and the matching principle which dictates expenses to be recognized in the period in which they are incurred.

As a result, adjusting entries are required to reconcile a flow of cash (or rarely other non-cash items) with events that have not occurred yet as either liabilities or assets. Because of the similarity between deferrals and their corresponding accruals, they are commonly conflated.|$|E

The company was selected for a visit by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (Norway) in recognition of its work in the field of biotechnology. Barentzymes is focused on the development of new original enzymes from the genetic resources of the Barents Sea.

Barentzymes have in its team experts who have developed a new advanced discovery platform that allows to profile new enzyme’s properties already at the sequence level. This ability to predict properties of an enzyme on an in silico level makes it possible for Barentzymes to reduce time and costs from the moment of the development of an enzyme to the testing of an enzyme for customer’s specific applications. Barentzymes work with specific needs of a customer and produce tailored solutions that solve a customer's particular problem.|$|E
40|$|This it {{the first}} of a series of papers devoted to the study of {{iterated}} loop spaces. Our goal is to develop a simple coherent theory which encompasses most of the known results about such spaces. We begin with some history and a description of the desiderata of such a theory. First of all, we require a <b>recognition</b> <b>principle</b> for n-fold loop spaces. That is, we wish to specify appropriate internal structure such that a space X possesses such structure if and only if X is of the (weak) homotopy type of an n-fold loop space. For the case n = 1, Stasheff’s notion [28] of an A ∞ space is such a <b>recognition</b> <b>principle.</b> Beck [5] has given an elegant proof of a <b>recognition</b> <b>principle,</b> but, in practice, his <b>recognition</b> <b>principle</b> appears to be unverifiable for a space that is not given a priori as an n-fold loop space. In the case n = ∞, a very convenient <b>recognition</b> <b>principle</b> is given by Boardman and Vogt’s notion [8] of a homotopy everything space, and, in [7], Boardman has stated a similar <b>recognition</b> <b>principle</b> for n < ∞. We shall prove a <b>recognition</b> <b>principle</b> for n < ∞ in section 13 (it will first be stated in section 1) and for n = ∞ in section 14; the latter result agrees (up to language) with that of Boardman and Vogt, but our proof is completely different. By generalizing the methods of Beck, we are able to obtain immediate non-iterative constructions of classifying spaces of all orders. Our proof also yields very precise consistency and naturality statements. In particular, a connected space X which satisfies our <b>recognition</b> <b>principle</b> (say for n = ∞) is not only weakly homotopy equivalent to an infinite loop space B 0 X, where spaces BiX with BiX = ΩBi+ 1 X are explicitly constructed, but also the given internal structure on X agrees under this equivalence with the internal structure on B 0 X derived from the existence of the spaces BiX. We shall have various other consistency statements and our subsequent papers will show that these statements help to make the <b>recognition</b> <b>principle</b> not merely a statement as to the existence of certain cohomology theories, but, far more important, an extremely effective tool for the calculation of the homology of the representing spaces. An alternative <b>recognition</b> <b>principle</b> in the case n = ∞ is due to Segal [26] and Anderso...|$|E
40|$|We set up operadic {{foundations}} for equivariant iterated loop space theory. We start by building {{up from a}} discussion of the approximation theorem and <b>recognition</b> <b>principle</b> for V-fold loop G-spaces to several avatars of a <b>recognition</b> <b>principle</b> for infinite loop G-spaces. We then explain what genuine permutative G-categories are and, more generally, what E_∞ G-categories are, giving examples showing how they arise. As an application, we prove the equivariant Barratt-Priddy-Quillen theorem as a statement about genuine G-spectra and use it to give a new, categorical, proof of the tom Dieck splitting theorem for suspension G-spectra.
