50|$|The same MRC trial {{mentioned}} above also analyzed {{the effects of}} anagrelide on bone marrow fibrosis, a common feature in patients with myelofibrosis. The use of anagrelide {{was associated with a}} rapid increase in the degree of <b>reticulin</b> deposition (the mechanism by which fibrosis occurs), when compared to those in whom hydroxyurea was used. Patients with myeloproliferative conditions are known to have a very slow and somewhat variable course of marrow fibrosis increase. This trend may be accelerated by anagrelide. Interestingly, this increase in fibrosis appeared to be linked to a drop in hemoglobin as it progressed. Fortunately, stopping the drug (and switching patients to hydroxyurea) appeared to reverse the degree of marrow fibrosis. Thus, patients on anagrelide may need to be monitored on a periodic basis for marrow <b>reticulin</b> scores, especially if anemia develops, or becomes more pronounced if present initially.|$|E

50|$|The {{modified}} Russel-Movat staining highlights a lot {{of tissue}} components in histological slides. It is obtained by a mix of five stains: alcian blue, Verhoeff hematoxylin, crocein scarlet combined with acidic fuchsine and saffron. At pH 2.5, alcian blue is fixed by electrostatic binding with the acidic mucopolysaccharides. The Verhoeff hematoxylin has a high affinity for nuclei and elastin fibers, negatively charged. The combination of crocein scarlet with acidic fuchsine stains acidophilic tissue components in red. Then, collagen and <b>reticulin</b> fibers are unstained by a reaction with phosphotungstic acid and stained in yellow by saffron.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} the <b>reticulin</b> silver stain is {{reviewed}} by Puchtler et al. (1978). The abstract of this paper says:Maresch (1905) introduced Bielschowsky's silver impregnation technic for neurofibrils as a stain for reticulum fibers, but emphasized the nonspecificity of such procedures. This lack of specificity has been confirmed repeatedly. Yet, since the 1920s the definition of [...] "reticulin" [...] and studies of its distribution were based solely on silver impregnation technics. The chemical mechanism and specificity of this group of stains is obscure. Application of Gömöri's and Wilder's methods to human tissues showed variations of staining patterns with the fixatives and technics employed. Besides reticulum fibers, various other tissue structures, e.g. I bands of striated muscle, fibers in nervous tissues, and model substances, e.g. polysaccharides, egg white, gliadin, were also stained. Deposition of silver compounds on reticulum fibers was limited to an easily removable substance; the remaining collagen component did not bind silver. These histochemical studies indicate that silver impregnation technics for reticulum fibers have no chemical significance and cannot be considered as histochemical technics for [...] "reticulin" [...] or type III collagen.|$|E
50|$|Fibronectin {{is located}} in the {{extracellular}} matrix of embryonic and adult tissues (not in the basement membranes of the adult tissues), but may be more widely distributed in inflammatory lesions. During blood clotting, the fibronectin remains associated with the clot, covalently cross-linked to fibrin with the help of Factor XIII (fibrin-stabilizing factor). Fibroblasts {{play a major role in}} wound healing by adhering to fibrin. Fibroblast adhesion to fibrin requires fibronectin, and was strongest when the fibronectin was cross-linked to the fibrin. Patients with Factor XIII deficiencies display impairment in wound healing as fibroblasts don't grow well in fibrin lacking Factor XIII. Fibronectin promotes particle phagocytosis by both macrophages and fibroblasts. Collagen deposition at the wound site by fibroblasts takes place with the help of fibronectin. Fibronectin was also observed to be closely associated with the newly deposited collagen fibrils. Based on the size and histological staining characteristics of the fibrils, it is likely that at least in part they are composed of type III collagen (<b>reticulin).</b> An in vitro study with native collagen demonstrated that fibronectin binds to type III collagen rather than other types.|$|E
5000|$|Histologically, tendons {{consist of}} dense regular {{connective}} tissue fascicles encased in dense irregular connective tissue sheaths. Normal healthy tendons are composed mostly of parallel arrays of collagen fibers closely packed together. The dry mass of normal tendons, which makes up about 30% {{of their total}} mass, is composed of about 86% collagen, 2% elastin, 1 - 5% proteoglycans, and 0.2% inorganic components such as copper, manganese, and calcium. The collagen portion {{is made up of}} 97 - 98% type I collagen, with small amounts of other types of collagen. These include type II collagen in the cartilaginous zones, type III collagen in the <b>reticulin</b> fibres of the vascular walls, type IX collagen, type IV collagen in the basement membranes of the capillaries, type V collagen in the vascular walls, and type X collagen in the mineralized fibrocartilage near the interface with the bone. Collagen fibres coalesce into macroaggregates. After secretion from the cell, the terminal peptides are cleaved by procollagen N- and C-proteinases, and the tropocollagen molecules spontaneously assemble into insoluble fibrils. A collagen molecule is about 300 nm long and 1 - 2 nm wide, and the diameter of the fibrils that are formed can range from 50 - 500 nm. In tendons, the fibrils then assemble further to form fascicles, which are about 10 mm in length with a diameter of 50 - 300 μm, and finally into a tendon fibre with a diameter of 100 - 500 μm. [...] Fascicles are bound by the endotendineum, which is a delicate loose connective tissue containing thin collagen fibrils. and elastic fibres. Groups of fascicles are bounded by the epitenon. Filling the interstitia within the fascia where the tendon is located is the paratenon a fatty areolar tissue.|$|E
5000|$|There is a {{great deal}} of {{conflicting}} information regarding the inclusion of oats in a gluten-free diet. Although cross-contamination in the field and during processing partially explains the different reactions that celiacs can have to oats, a recent study indicates that there are also different amounts of avenin present in different cultivars of oat. The G12 antibody used in the study is currently the only one that can reliably distinguish between varieties of oat. [...] Previous studies have indicated both children and adult coeliacs are largely tolerant of oats. Other studies have followed both children and adults for one, two, and five years on the [...] "uncontaminated" [...] oat containing gluten-free diet. These studies failed to show significant changes in intestinal morphology indicative of a relapse of celiac disease. Anti-gliadin and <b>reticulin</b> antibodies as well as numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) did not differ significantly between oat-eating celiacs and non-oat-eating controls in remission. Invitro tests that are sensitive to wheat gluten found that tryptic peptides of avenin could not induce EMA production in supernatant fluid from cultured duodenal mucosa specimen from celiac patients. Algorithms that successfully predict T cell stimulatory peptides in gluten identified many similar peptides in hordeins and secalins, but not in oat avenins.The Canadian Celiac Association suggests that adults can consume up to 70g of oats per day, and children up to 25g. However, two studies indicated that celiac adults could consume 93 grams (3.3 ounces) of oats per day. There is no evidence that oats can trigger GSE, only that in a small number of celiacs disease can be sustained or reinitiated by oats once triggered by wheat. A recent paper examining the IEL levels of celiac patients in remission showed a significantly higher number of IELs in oat-eating celiacs. In addition, antibodies to avenin remain low as long as the diet is gluten-free, but higher anti-avenin antibodies can increase with a diet containing wheat.|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} of collagen, <b>reticulin</b> and basement membrane is uncertain. <b>Reticulin</b> {{has been defined}} on an histological basis.
