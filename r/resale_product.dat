Rather, they resell mobile services by purchasing airtime at wholesale rates from mobile network operators (MNOs). Unlike ordinary resellers, MVNOs rely on brand appeal and reputation acquired in other businesses to sell mobile services (often bundled with other products). Significant worldwide growth in voluntary MNO-MVNO partnerships, without intervention from public policies that mandate MVNO access to MNO networks, raises many interesting issues. Since MNOs that sell wholesale services to MVNOs potentially forfeit sales in downstream retail markets, voluntary relationships are plausible only if MVNOs add value by widening and/or deepening MNO-served markets. This paper provides sufficient conditions for profit-maximizing MNOs and MVNOs to form voluntary strategic partnerships based on <b>resale,</b> <b>product</b> differentiation, and rebranding. The two key factors are (1) value of the MVNO's brand reputation and (2) wholesale discount at which the MNO offers service to the MVNO.

40|$|In this dissertation, I study {{three types}} of {{uncertainties}} in industrial practice: the demand uncertainty, the earnings uncertainty and the external market uncertainty. In particular, Chapter 2 prices the demand uncertainties in the just-in-time (JIT) outsourcing between an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and a contract manufacturer (CM) with flexible production capacity. Under this JIT outsourcing arrangement, the OEM transfers uncertain market demand to the CM without explicitly compensating the latter for the cost due to demand risks. I propose a model that prices the CM's cost of bearing this demand risk and the OEM's benefit of transferring it. I show that when the outsourcing demand is positively correlated with the either party's existing business, the higher risk it carries, the more it benefits the OEM and costs the CM. Chapter 3 proposes {{a model for a}} managed print services (MPS) provider to manage his earnings uncertainties by selecting contract terms. MPS is the unified management over institutional customers’ hardcopy device fleets. Using a proprietary dataset of Xerox, I study the optimal contracts from a risk-averse provider’s perspective. On the customer's side, I demonstrate that the customer's printing demand is insensitive to service prices. Furthermore, I show that a linear model can adequately characterize the customer's service payments. Using this linear model as an input, I build an optimization model that yields the optimal contracts that minimize the provider’s earnings variability while maximizing the expected earnings. Finally, I provide empirical evidence that the provider is better modeled as being risk-averse rather than risk-neutral. Chapter 4 aims to understand the uncertainties of the external market trends and market responses using resale prices of a particular type of used durable goods. I identify the market trends within each functionality segment, across the industry, and within each brand and OEM. I observe that the external market trends capture up to 81. 4 % of the volatility of an arbitrary <b>product’s</b> <b>resale</b> price, indicating strong comovements among different products. I also show there is no material impact on <b>product</b> <b>resale</b> prices due to brand termination. A big product recall, however, results in significant product price drops...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is the legal {{analysis}} of the main problems of parallel trade in the context of European Union (hereinafter EU). Parallel trade is a phenomenon characterized by the <b>resale</b> of original <b>products,</b> no counterfeit, outside the official distribution network. The free rider or independent reseller purchases products in a market where the price is low with the aim to resell them in other markets which accept a higher price for the same product. In these markets where the price is higher there is usually an official distribution network and its owners have trademark rights for the sold products. The price difference between the market A- where the free rider gets the products- and market B–where he resells- allows him to profit from the import. The above example is just a case of parallel trade. There can be different variants of this phenomenon.

40|$|Parallel {{trade is}} the <b>resale</b> of a <b>product</b> by a {{wholesaler}} {{in a market}} other than that intended by the manufacturer. One of its consequences is that manufacturers may be prevented from price discriminating between markets that have different willingness {{to pay for the}} product in question. Some legal regimes give the manu-facturer the right to prohibit parallel trade, but others do not.

We also consider the possibility that the authorities may impose price caps and compulsory licensing (as commonly occurs for some pharmaceutical products). We find that taking investment incentives into account makes parallel trade much less likely to enhance overall welfare, which implies that parallel trade in products intensive in R&D, such as pharmaceuticals, is less desirable than in fields such as branded consumer products. We also find that, somewhat surprisingly, the threat of parallel trade does not induce firms to market inferior versions of their products in poor countries. However, parallel trade is less likely to be detrimental to welfare when there are price caps, since compulsory licensing can mitigate the major cost of parallel trade (namely a refusal to supply a poor country market) ...|$|R

As {{it relates to}} managing product distribution, Russian vertical restraint law remains significantly more restrictive {{than that of the}} U. S. and, since unless a company is fully integrated, it must manage its distribution system by way of vertical agreements, presents a large problem for businesses seeking to conduct business in Russia. While Russia has made significant steps in the right direction, the lack of consistent application of economic analysis to evaluation of vertical restraints leaves companies exposed. Further, the sometimes inconsistent application of the laws also makes it hard to predict how any particular vertical agreement would be evaluated. Neither American nor Russian antitrust laws establish a list of possible vertical restraints. Thus, there is no exhaustive guidance regarding how these restraints should be treated. U. S. antitrust laws, however, generally place all vertical restraints into one of two categories, intrabrand restraints and interbrand restraints. Intrabrand restraints are those that restrain the downstream firm’s freedom with regard to the <b>resale</b> of the <b>product</b> at issue (distribution restrictions). Interbrand restraints are those that restrict a downstream or upstream firm’s freedom to deal with competitors of the firm imposing the restraint (interbrand restrictions).

40|$|Na formação do mercado de {{biodiesel}} no Brasil observa-se a criação de diversos arranjos institucionais alternativos para a produção desse biocombustível. Alguns arranjos surgiram espontaneamente, enquanto outros foram criados por meio de incentivos governamentais para atender aos objetivos de inclusão social e diversificação das matérias-primas. Este estudo tem como objetivo analisar os aspectos relacionados aos custos de transação que podem interferir no objetivo governamental de desenvolver novos arranjos institucionais envolvendo a agricultura familiar a partir de culturas alternativas à soja, especialmente mamona, girassol e pinhão manso, para a produção de biodiesel. O aporte teórico utilizado para embasar este estudo é a Nova Economia Institucional. Em especial, trata da influência do ambiente institucional sobre as escolhas dos agentes, considerando-se os custos de transação envolvidos nas relações de troca. A estratégia de pesquisa utilizada é o estudo de casos múltiplos. Os estudos de caso foram realizados em uma usina privada em Goiás e os respectivos agricultores contratados por ela; em uma usina subsidiária de uma empresa estatal localizada no Estado da Bahia e dos respectivos agricultores contratados por ela e o terceiro caso foi realizado com agricultores de assentamentos do Pontal do Paranapanema no Estado de São Paulo. A partir dos dados coletados, constatou-se que a compra de soja, via mercado, seria a escolha ótima caso o agente regulador não deslocasse a escolha dos agentes para arranjos considerados subótimos como a contratação de soja, mamona, girassol e pinhão manso, estimulados por incentivos tributários e de reserva de mercado. Também se verificou que a regulação insere especificidades nas relações que poderiam ser realizadas via mercado, aumentando o custo do arranjo e expondo a indústria ao comportamento oportunista do agricultor. Além disso, a transferência de conhecimento e tecnologia nos arranjos induzidos pelo agente regulador ocorre de maneira mais lenta. Como os agentes são levados a transacionar em arranjos de maior custo, identificou-se a criação de alguns mecanismos para a redução desses custos como a revenda dos produtos adquiridos da agricultura familiar e compra de óleo de soja no mercado para a produção de biodiesel, além de contratos de balcão com agricultores. Conclui-se que os custos de transação são maiores nos arranjos de matérias-primas alternativas à soja o que dificulta o alcance do objetivo governamental em estimular a produção de biodiesel na agricultura familiar a partir de matérias-primas diversificadas. Os custos de transação também são maiores com a agricultura familiar, consequentemente, os agentes compradores (usina privada e estatal) buscam adquirir a matéria prima de agricultores familiares produtores de soja que atuam a mais tempo nesta atividade e, assim, são considerados mais estruturados, apresentando vantagens em redução de custos de transação, quando comparados à agricultura familiar dedicada a culturas alternativas. In {{the formation}} of the biodiesel market in Brazil it was observed the creation of several alternative institutional arrangements for the production of this biofuel. Some arrangements were spontaneously formed, while other arrangements were created by government incentives to meet the objectives of social inclusion and diversification of raw materials. This study aims to analyze aspects related to transaction costs that may interfere with the governmental objective of developing new institutional arrangements involving the change from soya-based family farming, to other crops alternatives for biodiesel production, especially regarding castor beans, sunflower and jatropha. The New Institutional Economics is the theoretical approach that bases this study. In particular, it deals with the influence of institutional environment on the choices of agents, considering the transaction costs involved in transactions. The research strategy is the multiple cases study. The case studies were conducted with a private processing plant in Goias and with the farmers contracted by it; also in a subsidiary of state-owned company located in Bahia state and the farmers contracted by it; and the third was carried out with farmers settlement of the Pontal do Paranapanema in the state of Sao Paulo. From the data collected, {{it was found that the}} purchase of soybeans through the market would be the optimal choice if the regulator agent (government) hasn´t shift the choice of agents to an arrangement considered suboptimal as the hiring of soybean, rapeseed, sunflower and jatropha, encouraged by tax incentives and reserve market. It was also found that the regulation enters specificities into the relationships between buyers and sellers, increasing the cost of the arrangements, exposing the industry to farmer´s opportunistic behavior. Moreover, the transfer of expertise and technology in arrangements induced by the regulator agent occurs slowly. Because agents are induced to transact at higher-cost arrangements, it was identified the creation of mechanisms to reduce those costs, as the <b>resale</b> of <b>products</b> purchased from the family farm and purchase of soybean oil on the market, also as informal contracts with farmers, denominated fake contracts. It is concluded that transaction costs are higher in the arrangements of alternative raw materials when compared to the soybean, making it difficult to reach the goal of government in stimulating the production of biodiesel in family farm from diverse raw materials. Transaction costs are also higher with family farming, which implies that the buying agents (private and state plant) seek to acquire raw materials from family farmers used to the soybean production, and thus, are considered more structured, which give advantages in reducing transaction costs, when compared to family farms dedicated to alternative crops...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comprises {{of three}} chapters. The first chapter describes {{the development and}} implementation of a hierarchical framework for organizing the process for producing tax software at a leading tax software company in the United States. Every year, companies that produce commercial tax preparation software struggle with thousands of state and federal changes to tax laws and forms. Three competitors dominate the market with its short selling season, and release delays slash profits. Tax authorities issue updates August-December, and all changes must be processed and incorporated before year end. Systematic resource allocation and process management are crucial yet problematic due to the volume and complexity of changes, brief production timeframe, and feedback loops for bug resolution. A leading tax software provider asked us to formulate systematic approaches for managing process flow and staffing development stages with the goal of releasing the new version on time at minimum cost. To that end, we develop deterministic models in chapter 1 that partition tax forms into dedicated groups and determine staffing levels. Partitioning tax forms into groups simplifies workflow management and staffing decisions. To provide a range of resource configurations, we develop two modeling approaches. Numerical experiments show that our models capture the salient features of the process and that our heuristics perform well. Implementing our models reduced company overtime hours by 31 % and total resource costs by 13 %. The second and third chapters of the dissertation focus on supply chains that face competition from gray markets. Manufacturers in many industries have been challenged with the <b>resale</b> of their <b>products</b> in unauthorized distribution channels. Also known as parallel importation, gray markets are primarily driven by price differentials. When manufacturers release their products in different markets, they choose the price in each market based on consumer purchase power, sensitivity to price changes, and the overall economic conditions. This practice of price discrimination enables manufacturers to take advantage of differences between markets and maximize profit. However, price discrimination can potentially lead to the emergence of gray markets. Gray marketers buy products in the markets with lower prices and import them to markets with higher prices to sell below manufacturer price, thereby undermining the pricing structure of manufacturers and damaging brand value. The rapid growth and implications of gray markets have made it imperative for companies react to the diversion of their products to gray markets properly and take gray markets into consideration when making important strategic decisions. Chapter 2 analyzes the impact of parallel importation on a price-setting manufacturer that serves two markets with uncertain demand and characterizes the appropriate policy that the manufacturer should adopt against parallel importation. We show that adjusting prices is more effective in controlling gray market activity than reducing product availability, and that parallel importation forces the manufacturer to reduce the price gap while demand uncertainty forces the manufacturer to lower prices. We illustrate that ignoring demand uncertainty can take a significant toll on the manufacturer's profit. Furthermore, we explore the impact of market conditions (such as market base, price sensitivity, and demand uncertainty) and product characteristics (such as "fashion" vs. "commodity") on the manufacturer's policy. We also provide managerial insights about the value of strategic decision-making by comparing the optimal policy to the uniform pricing policy that has been adopted by some companies. Chapter 3 extends the Stackelberg game to analyze the role of providing service as a non-price mechanism in coping with parallel importation in a deterministic setting. We observe that the price and service competition leads to a Prisoner's Dilemma equilibrium: both players would be better off if the parallel importer does not offer service. We show that parallel importation forces the manufacturer to provide more service in both markets. Although the manufacturer achieves higher profits with providing service, the price gap may be higher or lower than when no service is provided. We find that a little service can go a long way; even if the contribution of service to total revenue in the absence of gray markets is not very large, the manufacturer can significantly increase total profits by providing service when facing gray market activities. Also, when consumers become indifferent between the manufacturer and the parallel importer, the manufacturer uses the service mechanism to differentiate herself from the parallel importer. However, when the parallel importer free rides on manufacturer service, the manufacturer provides lower service. We also consider the manufacturer's service policy towards customers who buy the product from the gray market, and show that the manufacturer may achieve higher profit by allowing more parallel imports and charging gray market customers a service fee...|$|R
