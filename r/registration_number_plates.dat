50|$|Vehicle {{registration}} plates, usually {{known as}} number plates, have {{existed in the}} United Kingdom since 1904. Most motor vehicles which are used on public roads are {{required by law to}} display them. The Motor Car Act 1903, which came into force on 1 January 1904, required all motor vehicles to be entered on an official vehicle register, and to carry number plates. The Act was passed in order that vehicles could be easily traced {{in the event of an}} accident or contravention of the law. Vehicle <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> <b>plates</b> in the UK are rectangular or square in shape, with the exact permitted dimensions of the plate and its lettering set down in law. Within the UK itself there are currently two numbering and registration systems: one for the island of Great Britain, which is administered by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), and one for Northern Ireland, administered by the Driver & Vehicle Agency (DVA): both have equal status.

A compulsory third party insurance policy is required to renew the vehicle, as well as inspections for older or commercial vehicles. [...] While most states and territories no longer issue registration stickers for the vehicle, registration details are available electronically by police or online by individuals in most states.

Production is falsely transfer by the unauthorized truck from mine pits also at loading point. It also lifted in wrong ways by malfunctioning of the truck weight in Weigh Bridge. Mining organizations are under the control of mafia and countless can be added to the mines mafia. An intelligence security system is need to monitor truck number in automatically using image acquisition method, automatic detection, recognition process, communication technology, information technology and microcontroller innovation to understand the working specification of the mining region. Tracking of the <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> from the truck is an important task, which demands intelligent solution. Intelligent surveillance in open casts mine security network using data accession is a prime task that protects the secure production of mines. So automatic truck number recognition technique is used to recognize the <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> of the truck which is used for transferring the mine production as well as track record the amount of the production. It also preserves the mines and thus improving its security. For extraction and recognition of <b>number</b> <b>plate</b> from truck image the system is uses MATLAB software tool.

The data are communicated through USB to TTL converter (RS 232) with the main circuit to realize intelligent monitoring. To store the data in permanently it is uses EEPROM chip. Alphanumeric Characters on plate has been extracted and recognized using template images of alphanumeric characters.
