5|$|Although {{there exist}} {{polynomial}} time algorithms {{to find a}} matrix having given <b>row</b> <b>and</b> column sums, the solution may be far from unique: any submatrix {{in the form of}} a 22 identity matrix can be complemented without affecting the correctness of the solution. Therefore, researchers have searched for constraints on the shape to be reconstructed that can be used to restrict the space of solutions. For instance, one might assume that the shape is connected; however, testing whether there exists a connected solution is NP-complete. An even more constrained version that is easier to solve is that the shape is orthogonally convex: having a single contiguous block of squares in each <b>row</b> <b>and</b> column.|$|E

50|$|For biclusters with {{coherent}} {{values on}} <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> columns, an overall {{improvement over the}} algorithms for biclusters with constant values on rows or on columns should be considered.

In Cheng and Church's theorem, a bicluster {{is defined as a}} subset of <b>rows</b> <b>and</b> columns with almost the same score.

5|$|Although hieroglyphic text may be {{laid out}} in varying manners, {{generally}} text is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks. The reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a <b>row</b> <b>and</b> starts again from the left half of the double column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column. Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.|$|E
