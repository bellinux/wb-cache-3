40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis is {{the most}} common {{notifiable}} sexually transmissible infection in Australia with the highest prevalence in young people and {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM). Repeat detection of chlamydia is common following treatment, mainly as a result of reinfection. <b>Retesting</b> at three months to detect reinfections is important to prevent onward transmission and reproductive morbidity, but <b>retesting</b> rates are low. At the time this thesis commenced, there were a limited number of evaluations of interventions to improve <b>retesting</b> rates, with postal test kits and telephone reminders, found to be the most effective, but no assessment of SMS reminders. This thesis arises from a randomised controlled trial (RCT) to assess the effectiveness of postal test kits combined with short message service (SMS) reminders (intervention) to increase <b>retesting</b> after a chlamydia diagnosis among sexual health clinic patients, compared with SMS reminders and return to the clinic only. The RCT involved 600 participants (200 each of women, heterosexual men and MSM) with the study design described in Chapter 2. Chapter 3 shows the intervention was associated with substantial improvements in chlamydia <b>retesting</b> at 1 - 4 months in all risk groups and detection of more positive <b>retests.</b> Chapter 4 describes an acceptability survey which found the intervention was preferred by most participants over clinic-based <b>retesting</b> and preference was associated with being comfortable having a kit sent to their home, no previous chlamydia diagnosis, and living with friends, highlighting the importance of providing <b>retesting</b> options. In the same chapter, the cost of the intervention and infection detected were found to be lower than clinic-based <b>retesting.</b> Chapter 4 investigated behavioural and organism factors associated with positive <b>retests.</b> Treatment failure was more common in MSM with rectal chlamydia, reinforcing concerns about azithromycin treatment failure. In conclusion, this thesis demonstrated that the use of postal test kits combined with SMS reminders, was more effective at increasing <b>retesting</b> rates and detecting positive <b>retests</b> among sexual health clinic attendees than SMS reminders and returning to the clinic; the intervention was also acceptable to patients and cost saving. Extending the intervention to other primary care settings should be considered...|$|R

40|$|SummaryOne of {{the goals}} of a Newborn Hearing Screening Program (NHSP) is to have a low <b>retesting</b> rate. AimTo {{investigate}} the association between the <b>retesting</b> rate and the bath of newborn babies. Study design: cross-sectional contemporary cohort. Materials and MethodsTransient otoacoustic emissions (TOE) results have been compared to the information received from the nurse's aide who bathed the babies {{on the day of the}} test (373 newborns), and the time interval between the TOE study and the last bath (350 newborns). ResultsSignificant statistical differences were found in relation to the percentage of <b>retesting</b> when babies were bathed by certain nurse's aides. On the other hand, the percentage of <b>retesting</b> decreased significantly when the time interval between the last bath and the TOE study was longer than 7 hours and 50 minutes. ConclusionMoisture of the external acoustic meatus, caused by inappropriate protection against water during bath, and the short interval between the bath and the ETOE study, could be considered as possible factors causing <b>retesting</b> in NHSP programs...|$|R
