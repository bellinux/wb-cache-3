5|$|In later years, {{there was}} a flurry of {{contradictory}} statements from convention members (including Mason) about who composed which articles. Randolph credited Henry with Articles 15 and 16, but the latter (dealing with religious freedom), was written by Madison. Mason had imitated English law in drafting language requiring toleration of those of minority religions, but Madison insisted on full <b>religious</b> <b>liberty,</b> and Mason supported Madison's amendment once made.|$|E

Many raised concerns about the Soviet Union and Red Army's continued military occupation of the Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s, prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall and collapse of Communism in Moscow and Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Concord, Pierce {{resumed his}} law work; in one notable case he defended the <b>religious</b> <b>liberty</b> of the Shakers, the insular sect {{who were being}} {{threatened}} with legal action over accusations of child abuse. His role as a party leader, however, continued to take up most of his attention. He continued to wrangle with Senator Hale, who was stridently anti-slavery and had opposed the war, stances that Pierce regarded as needless agitation.|$|E
5|$|Upon Umar's {{arrival in}} Jerusalem, a pact known as The Umariyya Covenant was composed. It {{surrendered}} {{the city and}} gave guarantees of civil and <b>religious</b> <b>liberty</b> to Christians in exchange for jizya. It was signed by caliph Umar {{on behalf of the}} Muslims, and witnessed by Khalid, Amr, Abdur Rahman bin Awf, and Muawiyah. In late April 637, Jerusalem was officially surrendered to the caliph. For the first time, after almost 500 years of oppressive Roman rule, Jews were once again allowed to live and worship inside Jerusalem.|$|E

5|$|Walsingham {{advocated}} {{direct intervention}} in the Netherlands {{in support of the}} Protestant revolt against Spain, on the grounds that although wars of conquest were unjust, wars in defence of <b>religious</b> <b>liberty</b> and freedom were not. Cecil was more circumspect and advised a policy of mediation, a policy that Elizabeth endorsed. Walsingham was sent on a special embassy to the Netherlands in 1578, to sound out a potential peace deal and gather military intelligence.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Borgerhout was {{a battle}} during the Eighty Years' War, of the Spanish Army of Flanders led by Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma, upon a {{fortified}} camp {{at the village}} of Borgerhout, near Antwerp, where several thousand French, English, Scottish and Walloon soldiers in service of the recently created Union of Utrecht were stationed. It {{took place during the}} reconquest by the armies of Philip II of Spain of the Burgundian Netherlands, whose different provinces had united in 1576 under the Pacification of Ghent to drive out the foreign troops out and to grant <b>religious</b> <b>liberty</b> to Protestants.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving in}} the militia in 1779, Garrard was elected to {{represent}} Stafford County the Virginia House of Delegates, and he assumed his seat for the 1779 legislative session. His major contribution to the session was advocating for a bill that granted <b>religious</b> <b>liberty</b> to all residents of Virginia; passage of the bill ended persecution by citizens who associated with the Church of England upon followers of other faiths and countered an effort by some to establish the Church of England as Virginia's official church. After the session, {{he returned to his}} military duties. In 1781, he was promoted to the rank of colonel.|$|E

5|$|Winckelmann’s {{theories}} {{on the evolution}} of art culminated in the Sublime period of Greek art, which had been conceived during a period of complete political and <b>religious</b> <b>liberty.</b> The theories idealised Ancient Greece and increased people’s desire to travel to contemporary Greece. It was seductive to believe, as he did, that 'good taste' was born beneath the Greek sky. He convinced 18th-century Europe that life in Ancient Greece was pure, simple and moral, and that classical Hellas was the source from which artists should draw ideas of “noble simplicity and calm grandeur”. Greece became the “motherland of the arts” and “the teacher of taste”.|$|E
5|$|With the British {{colonization}} of Georgia in 1732, the 13 colonies {{that would become}} the United States of America were established. All had local governments with elections open to most free men, with a growing devotion to the ancient rights of Englishmen {{and a sense of}} self-government stimulating support for republicanism. With extremely high birth rates, low death rates, and steady settlement, the colonial population grew rapidly. Relatively small Native American populations were eclipsed. The Christian revivalist movement of the 1730s and 1740s known as the Great Awakening fueled interest in both religion and <b>religious</b> <b>liberty.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following the Third Circuit's decision, Heffernan {{petitioned the}} Supreme Court for certiorari, {{requesting}} {{they hear the}} case.

Both parties consented to the filing of amicus curiae briefs by uninvolved parties who believed they had a stake in the outcome of the case. The National Association of Government Employees, Becket Fund for <b>Religious</b> <b>Liberty,</b> and Thomas Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression filed amicus briefs in support of Heffernan, while the New Jersey State League of Municipalities and the National Conference of State Legislatures filed briefs in support of the City of Paterson. The United States government also filed an amicus brief in support of Heffernan, as well as a motion to appear at oral argument, which the Court granted, meaning the Solicitor General's office would be appearing at oral arguments, held on January 19, 2016.|$|E

5000|$|The Rutherford Institute {{was named}} after Samuel Rutherford, a 17th-century theologian who wrote a book, Lex, Rex, which {{challenged}} {{the concept of the}} divine right of kings.
