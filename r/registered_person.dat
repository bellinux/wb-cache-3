50|$|VAT {{taxation}} under Bulgarian tax law {{is regulated}} by Value Added Tax Act (VATA) (Bulg: Закон за данък върху добавената стойност), the Regulation for the Application of VATA (RAVATA) and Directive 2006/112 -COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 {{on the common}} system of value added tax.This type of indirect tax is payable monthly for all supplies of goods or services for any intra-European Union acquisition whose place of performance is within the country, carried out by a <b>registered</b> <b>person,</b> {{as well as for}} importation of goods. VAT is a tax levied on newly created value during the implementation process of goods or services. The tax is levied on the consumption thereof and the group of turnover taxes. The VAT model under Bulgarian law follows the common VAT regime within the EU model, where personal expenses are taxable by applying the credit (invoice) method. According to this method, each stage of production of goods or services and the implementation thereof to end users is chargeable with VAT on the entire value of the supply, such that through the mechanism of tax credit the final price of the goods or services includes a single VAT charge in the amount of the respective tax rate.A taxable person is any person who independently carries out an economic activity, whatever the purpose and results of that activity, as well as any person who performs accidental onerous intra-European Union supplies of new transport vehicles. „Independent economic activity” are the activities of producers, traders and persons supplying services, including mining and agriculture, as well as the practice of a liberal profession, including as private enforcement agents and notaries.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} optimal operator for combining {{left and}} right sole pressure data in a personal authentication method by dynamic change of sole pressure distribution while walking. The method employs a pair of right and left sole pressure distribution change data. These data are acquired by a mat-type load distribution sensor. The system extracts features based on shape of sole and weight shift from each sole pressure distribution. We calculate fuzzy degrees of right and left sole pressures for a <b>registered</b> <b>person.</b> Fuzzy if-then rules for each <b>registered</b> <b>person</b> are statistically determined by learning data set. Next, we combine the fuzzy degrees of right and left sole pressure data. In this process, we consider six combination operators. We examine which operator achieves best accuracy for the personal authentication. In the authentication system, we identify the walking persons as a <b>registered</b> <b>person</b> with the highest fuzzy degree. We verify the walking person as the target person when the combined fuzzy degree of the walking person is higher than a threshold. In our experiment, we employed 90 volunteers, and our method obtained higher authentication performance by mean and weighted sum operators...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a biometric personal authentication method, using {{a pair of}} right and left sole pressure distribution changes, while walking. This system acquires sole pressure distribution changes via a mat type load distribution sensor, and does personal authentication. We employ twelve features based on {{the shape of a}} footprint, and twenty seven features based on weight movement for sole pressure data. Fuzzy if-then rules for each <b>registered</b> <b>person</b> are introduced, within which, their parameters are statistically determined in the learning process. We calculate the fuzzy degree of a pair of right and left sole pressure data for any <b>registered</b> <b>person,</b> and identify the walking person as the person with the highest fuzzy degree; the fuzzy degree being higher than a threshold. We employed 90 volunteers and authenticated them. We evaluate the proposed fuzzy method by five hold cross validation on which low false rejection and false acceptance rates are achieved. Thus, this fuzzy logic approach is precise for this biometric system...|$|E
