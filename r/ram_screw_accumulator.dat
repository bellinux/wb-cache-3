50|$|Lieutenant Commander Francis Asbury Roe of Sassucus, seeing Albemarle at a {{range of}} about 400 yd, decided to ram. The Union ship struck the Confederate ironclad full and square, broadside-on, {{shattering}} the timbers of her own bow, twisting off her own bronze ram in the process, and jamming both ships together. With Sassucuss hull almost touching {{the end of the}} ram's Brooke rifle, Albemarles gun crew quickly fired two point-blank rifled shells, one of them puncturing Sassucuss boilers; though live steam was roaring through the ship, she was able to break away and drift out of range. Miami first tried to use her spar torpedo and then to tangle the Confederate <b>rams</b> <b>screw</b> propellers and rudder with a seine net, but neither ploy succeeded. More than 500 shells were fired at Albemarle during the battle; with visible battle damage to her smokestack and other areas on the ironclad, she steamed back up the Roanoke, soon mooring at Plymouth.|$|R
50|$|Smith, {{despite an}} {{advantage}} in numbers, could do little damage to the single Confederate ship. Shots glanced off Albemarles sides. Lieutenant Commander Francis Asbury Roe of Sassucus, seeing Albemarle at a range of about 400 yd, decided to ram.

Sassacus by now was too damaged to function and drifted down river.

40|$|Bodies are {{considered}} which under simple shear stress move with a strain rate proportional to {{a power of}} the shear stress. A study is made {{of the relationship of}} the bodies in question to more general continua, and of the properties which they exhibit under simple conditions. Results are presented regarding the pressure flow in a conical die; the behaviour during <b>ram</b> or <b>screw</b> extrusion is also discussed...|$|R

Auger firmly fastened onto <b>ram</b> shaft by <b>screw</b> and kept from rotating on shaft by slot machined into end of stem and male driving lug that engages slot.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is a complex design of the {{spotting}} press with a nominal force of 500 kN, which is intended for mating of the both halves of pressing tool for the automotive industry. The press ram is fitted with a hydraulic mechanism which allows the upper clamping board to be tilted in range of 0 ° - 180 ° and removed from the working space of the press along a profile track. The lower clamping board {{is a part of}} moving bolster, which is equipped with a mechanism for lifting and centring. The concept of motion screws is used to drive the <b>ram.</b> Motion <b>screws</b> are mounted in a multiple-part frame and driven by servomotors. The thesis contains background research of the issue, solutions of the main design nodes of the press including calculations, detailed 3 D model of the device and partial drawing documentation...|$|R
25|$|Direct {{extrusion}}, {{also known}} as forward extrusion, {{is the most common}} extrusion process. It works by placing the billet in a heavy walled container. The billet is pushed through the die by a <b>ram</b> or <b>screw.</b> There is a reusable dummy block between the ram and the billet to keep them separated. The major disadvantage of this process is that the force required to extrude the billet is greater than that needed in the indirect extrusion process because of the frictional forces introduced by the need for the billet to travel {{the entire length of the}} container. Because of this the greatest force required is at the beginning of process and slowly decreases as the billet is used up. At the end of the billet the force greatly increases because the billet is thin and the material must flow radially to exit the die. The end of the billet (called the butt end) is not used for this reason.|$|R
40|$|International audienceExtrusion is {{a common}} forming process {{for a wide range}} of {{materials}} (food, polymer, clay, metal), although it is not yet a common way to form cement-based materials on an industrial scale. This is both explained by the heterogeneity (large range of grain size) and the specific rheological behaviour (frictional behaviour due to high solid volume fraction) of such materials. Recent studies have highlighted the predominance of the filtration phenomenon during the extrusion flow of firm cement-based materials. Such a filtration leads to process blockage and prohibits its utilisation in industrial settings. In the present study the introduction of a vibration system to the extruder in order to inprove the extrusion flow was investigated. The effects of such external excitation on the rheological behaviour of a firm extrudible cement-based paste (yield stress reduction without losing retaining shape properties) were examined and some extrusion tests (<b>ram</b> and <b>screw</b> extruders) were performed to show the potential of a vibration/extrusion coupling...|$|R
50|$|Seeing {{things going}} badly, Persano decided to <b>ram</b> the {{unarmoured}} <b>screw</b> battleship Kaiser {{rather than one}} of the armoured ships engaged with the Italian 2nd Division much nearer him. However, Kaiser managed to dodge Affondatore. Taking heart from his admiral, the captain of Re di Portogallo laid heavy fire on Kaiser with his rifled guns. At the last moment, von Petz turned into the ram, conducting a counter ram. The impact tore off Kaisers stem and bowsprit, leaving her figurehead embedded in Re di Portogallo. The Italian used the opportunity to rake Kaiser with fire, putting her mainmast and funnel into the sea. The smoke was so great that as they backed off for another ram they lost sight of each other and ended the duel.|$|R
40|$|Initial work {{presented}} in this dissertation on extrusion supports the findings of others with regard to standard die extrusion. In addition, comparisons between <b>ram</b> and <b>screw</b> extrusion results were made and are briefly discussed. In relation to wide sheet extrusion, unusual flow instabilities {{in the form of}} central line splitting of the extrudates were observed for the first time, indicating that the chocolate was weak in tension. Solutions for eliminating for flow defects are also presented and mathematical modelling provided insight into the flow mechanism. Post extrusion mechanical characterisation of the extruded chocolate was carried out by means of bending and indentation tests and the effect of processing conditions on the flexibility and hardness of chocolate extrudate was examined. The results showed the presence of a two-stage, post extrusion rehardening process, which was consistent with earlier findings. In terms of stamping, the process itself and the effect of processing variables on the shape formability and surface gloss formation in the chocolate product were established for the first time. Optimal conditions that contributed to the formation of well-defined products with high gloss finish were identified. Product demoulding was also found to be facilitated {{with the use of a}} Teflon die. Both the wide sheet extrusion and the stamping process were simulated by numerical models using the finite element codes Forge 3 ® and 2 ® respectively. In general, good agreement was achieved between the experimental and numerical results. Moreover, a preliminary, semi-analytical model was proposed to describe the mechanism of surface gloss formation during stamping. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
50|$|A {{bottle jack}} or whiskey jack is a jack which resembles a bottle in shape, having a {{cylindrical}} {{body and a}} neck. Within is a vertical lifting ram with a support pad of some kind fixed to the top. The jack may be hydraulic or work by screw action. In the hydraulic version the hydraulic ram emerges from the body vertically by hydraulic pressure provided by a pump either on the baseplate or at a remote location via a pressure hose. With a single action piston the lift range is somewhat limited, so its use for lifting vehicles is limited to those with a relatively high clearance. For lifting structures such as houses the hydraulic interconnection of multiple vertical jacks through valves enables the even distribution of forces while enabling close control of the lift. The screw version of the bottle jack works by turning a large nut running on the threaded vertical ram at {{the neck of the}} body. The nut has gear teeth and is turned by a bevel gear spigotted to the body, the bevel gear being turned manually by a jack handle fitting into a square socket. The ram may have a second <b>screwed</b> <b>ram</b> within it, which doubles the lifting range telescopically.|$|R
