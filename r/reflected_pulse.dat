If one of the materials is a gas such as air - as in the case with delaminations, cracks and voids - the degree of reflection at the solid-to-gas interface is near 100%, the amplitude of the <b>reflected</b> <b>pulse</b> is very high, and practically none of the pulse travels deeper into the sample.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Active {{range imaging}} (RI) systems utilize {{actively}} controlled light sources emitting laser pulses that are subsequently recorded by an imaging system {{and used for}} depth profile estimation. Classical RI systems are limited by their need for {{a large number of}} frames required to obtain high resolution depth information. In this work, we propose an RI approach motivated by the recently proposed compressed sensing framework to dra-matically reduce the number of necessary frames. Compressed gated range sensing employs a random gating mechanism along with state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms for the estimation of the timing of the <b>reflected</b> <b>pulses</b> and the inference of distances. In addition to efficiency, the proposed scheme is also able to identify multiple <b>reflected</b> <b>pulses</b> that can be introduced by semi-transparent elements in the scene such as clouds, smoke, and foliage. Simulations under highly realistic conditions demonstrate that the proposed architecture is capable of accurately recovering the depth profile of a scene from as few as 10 frames at 100 depth bins resolution, even under very challenging conditions. The results further indicate that the proposed architecture is able to extract multiple <b>reflected</b> <b>pulses</b> with a minimal {{increase in the number of}} frames, in situations where state-of-the-art methods fail to accurately estimate the correct depth signals. © The Authors.

50|$|For direct TOF imagers, such as 3D Flash LIDAR, {{a single}} short pulse from 5 to 10 ns is emitted by the laser. The T-zero event (the time the pulse leaves the camera) is {{established}} by capturing the pulse directly and routing this timing onto the focal plane array. T-zero {{is used to}} compare the return time of the returning <b>reflected</b> <b>pulse</b> on the various pixels of the focal plane array. By comparing T-zero and the captured returned pulse and comparing the time difference, each pixel accurately outputs a direct time-of-flight measurement. The round trip of a single pulse for 100 meters is 660 ns. With a 10 ns pulse, the scene is illuminated and the range and intensity captured in less than 1 microsecond.|$|E
50|$|The optical pulse is {{attenuated}} as it propagates {{along the}} fiber. For a {{single mode fiber}} operating at 1550 nm, a typical attenuation is 0.2 dB/km. Since the light must make a double pass along each section of fiber, this means each 1 km causes a total loss of 0.4 dB. The maximum range of the system occurs when the amplitude of the <b>reflected</b> <b>pulse</b> becomes so low {{it is impossible to}} obtain a clear signal from it. It is not possible to counteract this effect by increasing the input power because above a certain level this will induce nonlinear optical effects which will disrupt the operation of the system. Typically the maximum range that can be measured is around 40-50 km.|$|E
5000|$|The yaw/pitch (angle w2) {{direction}} of the target depended on how far to {{the outer edge of}} the mirror the target was. If the target was further off axis, the rays reaching the detector would be reflected from {{the outer edge of the}} mirror. If the target was closer on axis, the rays would be reflected from closer to the centre of the mirror. Rotating on a fixed shaft, the mirror's linear speed was higher at the outer edge. Therefore, if a target was further off-axis, its [...] "flash" [...] in the detector occurred for a briefer time, or longer if it was closer to the center.

5000|$|The LADS {{system is}} built around a Nd:YAG laser, which emits an infra-red beam at 990 hertz. The beam is {{frequency}} doubled to produce a green laser. This is split into two beams, one infra-red, one green, by an optical coupler, with the infra-red beam aimed directly below the aircraft, and the green beam directed across the target area with a scanning mirror. The infra-red laser does not penetrate the water's surface, and its <b>reflected</b> <b>pulse</b> indicates {{the height of the}} aircraft above the surface.

The aircraft makes multiple, overlapping passes of the target area to ensure accurate data is collected. The LADS system is capable of taking 990 soundings per second, with data points positioned 2 to 6 m apart across a swath up to 288 m wide.

50|$|The LIDAR system {{consisted}} of a 180 mJ, 1064 nm wavelength Nd-YAG (Yttrium-Aluminum-Garnet) laser transmitter which transmitted pulses to the lunar surface. The laser produced a pulse with a width less than 10 ns. At 1064 nm wavelength, the pulse had an energy of 171 mJ with a divergence less than 500 microrad. At 532 nm, it had a 9 mJ pulse with a 4 millirad divergence. The <b>reflected</b> <b>pulse</b> travelled through the High-Resolution Camera telescope, where it was split off by a dichroic filter to a silicon avalanche photodiode detector. The detector was a single 0.5 &times; 0.5 mm cell SiAPD receiver with a field of view of 0.057 square degrees. The laser had a mass of 1250 g, the receiver was housed in the 1120 g HIRES camera. The travel time of a pulse gave the range to the surface. The LIDAR memory could save up to six return detections per laser firing, with a threshold set for the best compromise between missed detections and false alarms. The returns were stored in 39.972 m range bins, equal to {{the resolution of the}} 14-bit clock counter. The LIDAR has a nominal range of 500 km, but altimetric data was gathered for altitudes up to 640 km, which allowed coverage from 60 degrees south to 60 degrees north {{by the end of the}} lunar phase of the mission. The vertical resolution is 40 m, and the horizontal spot resolution is about 100 m. The across track spacing of the measurements at the equator was about 40 km.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of wave propagation and reflection in an acoustic waveguide with random sound soft boundary and a turning point. The waveguide has slowly bending axis and variable cross section. The variation consists of a slow and monotone change of {{the width of the}} waveguide and small and rapid fluctuations of the boundary, on the scale of the wavelength. These fluctuations are modeled as random. The turning point is many wavelengths away from the source, which emits a pulse that propagates toward the turning point, where it is reflected. To focus attention on this reflection, we assume that the waveguide supports a single propagating mode from the source to the turning point, beyond which all the waves are evanescent. We consider a scaling regime where scattering at the random boundary has a significant effect on the <b>reflected</b> <b>pulse.</b> In this regime scattering from the random boundary away from the turning point is negligible, while scattering from the random boundary around the turning point results in a strong, deterministic pulse deformation. The <b>reflected</b> <b>pulse</b> shape {{is not the same as}} the emitted one. It is damped, due to scattering at the boundary, and is deformed by dispersion in the waveguide.

40|$|In this {{companion}} {{paper to}} our study of amplification of wavetrains [CGW 13], we study weakly stable semilinear hyperbolic boundary value problems with pulse data. Here weak sta-bility means that exponentially growing modes are absent, but the so-called uniform Lopatinskii condition fails at some boundary frequency in the hyperbolic region. As {{a consequence of}} this degeneracy there is again an amplification phenomenon: outgoing pulses of amplitude O(ε 2) and wavelength ε give rise to <b>reflected</b> <b>pulses</b> of amplitude O(ε), so the overall solution has amplitude O(ε). Moreover, the <b>reflecting</b> <b>pulses</b> emanate from a radiating pulse that propagates in the boundary along a characteristic of the Lopatinskii determinant. In the case of N×N systems considered here, a single outgoing pulse produces on reflection a family of incoming pulses traveling at different group velocities. Unlike wavetrains, pulses do not interact to produce resonances that affect the leading order profiles. However, pulse interactions do affect lower order profiles and so these interactions have to be estimated carefully in the error analysis. Whereas the error analysis in the wavetrain case dealt with small divisor problems by approximating periodic profiles by trigonometric polynomials (which amounts to using a hig...|$|R
