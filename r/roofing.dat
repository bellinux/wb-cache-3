40|$|Three hip <b>roofed</b> {{building}} {{models of}} 15 °, 20 °, and 30 ° <b>roof</b> pitch, respectively, are {{tested in a}} wind tunnel to investigate wind pressure distributions over hip <b>roofs</b> {{and the effect of}} <b>roof</b> pitch on <b>roof</b> pressures. The pressures measured on the hip <b>roofs</b> are then compared with those on gable <b>roofs</b> of otherwise similar geometry to evaluate the effect of <b>roof</b> shape on <b>roof</b> pressures. Finally, the measured <b>roof</b> pressures of commonly-used probability of occurrence are compared with Meecham's work in terms of local mean and peak pressures. The results show that <b>roof</b> pitch does affect both the magnitude and distribution of hip <b>roof</b> pressures. The 30 ° hip <b>roof</b> experiences the highest peak suction at <b>roof</b> corner among the three tested hip <b>roofs.</b> The worst peak suctions are much smaller on the hip <b>roofs</b> than on the gable <b>roofs</b> for 15 ° and 20 ° <b>roof</b> pitches. However, the worst peak suctions on the hip and gable <b>roofs</b> are almost the same for 30 ° <b>roof</b> pitch. It is also seen that the magnitudes and distributions of local mean and peak pressures on the low pitched hip <b>roof</b> tested here are compatible with the results from Meecham's work on a hip <b>roof</b> of similar geometry.

5|$|The Exchange {{underwent}} major building work in 1872, including <b>roofing</b> {{over the}} courtyard, {{and again in}} the early 1900s when the City Valuer's Department moved to the building. Since World War II the external clock tower has been removed and the roof lowered.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, ground {{development}} {{continued with}} <b>roofing</b> enhancements to the North Stand {{and an increase}} in capacity to 31,500 by 1963. Dressing rooms were constructed in 1965 and new turnstiles were introduced two years later, including a separate entrance for juveniles at the Churchmans end. In 1968 the club agreed to a new 99-year lease on the ground with owners Ipswich Borough Council.|$|E
50|$|A bell <b>roof</b> (bell-shaped <b>roof,</b> ogee <b>roof,</b> Philibert de l'Orme <b>roof)</b> is a <b>roof</b> form {{resembling}} {{the shape of}} a bell.

5|$|Other {{buildings}} {{constructed by}} David Balfour include the Dishan Tower, {{known locally as}} The Douche. This is a saltwater shower building with a dovecote on top. A local landmark due to its high visibility when approaching the island by sea, the building {{is now in a}} serious state of disrepair, with <b>roofing</b> slates missing and the dovecote in danger of collapsing.|$|E
5|$|The Barclay {{is named}} after Captain Evelyn Barclay, a former {{vice-president}} of the club, who donated the cost of <b>roofing</b> the original stand. This was built in 1937, but demolished in 1992, when a new two-tier structure, modelled on the River End (now the Norwich & Peterborough Stand) was built {{in accordance with the}} recommendations of the Taylor Report.|$|E

50|$|A flat <b>roof</b> is {{the most}} {{cost-efficient}} <b>roof</b> shape as all room space can be used fully (below and above the <b>roof).</b> Having a smaller surface area, flat <b>roofs</b> require less material and are usually stronger than pitched <b>roofs.</b> This style <b>roof</b> also provides ample space for solar panels or outdoor recreational use such as <b>roof</b> gardens. Applying a tough waterproofing membrane forms the ideal substrate for green <b>roof</b> planting schemes.|$|R
5000|$|A hip <b>roof,</b> hip-roof or hipped <b>roof,</b> {{is a type}} of <b>roof</b> {{where all}} sides slope {{downwards}} to the walls, usually with a fairly gentle slope (although a tented <b>roof</b> by definition is a hipped <b>roof</b> with steeply pitched slopes rising to a peak). Thus a hipped <b>roof</b> house has no gables or other vertical sides to the <b>roof.</b>|$|R
5|$|The tegula (Greek solenes) was a plain flat tile, or a flat tile with raised edges, {{which was}} laid flat upon the roof, while the imbrex (Greek kalupter) was a semi-cylindrical <b>roofing</b> tile, like a half-pipe, laid over the joints between the tegulae. When well-made and {{properly}} imbricated (overlapped), {{there was little}} need for further waterproofing or sealant.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{is used in}} the {{construction}} of buildings, bridges, trackways, piles, poles for power lines, masts for boats, pit props, railway sleepers, fencing, hurdles, shuttering for concrete, pipes, scaffolding and pallets. In housebuilding it is used in joinery, for making joists, roof trusses, <b>roofing</b> shingles, thatching, staircases, doors, window frames, floor boards, parquet flooring, panelling and cladding.|$|E
5|$|At West Palm Beach, the {{majority}} of the damage was confined to vegetation. Several coconut and royal palms that withstood the 1928 hurricane snapped, littering streets with broken trunks. Winds downed road signs on many streets, and floodwaters covered the greens on a local golf course. Some garages and isolated structures, mostly lightweight, were partly or totally destroyed, along with a lumber warehouse. Some homes that lost <b>roofing</b> shingles had water damage to their interiors as well. Nearby Lake Worth sustained extensive breakage of windows, including plate glass, and loss of tile and shingle <b>roofing,</b> but preparations reduced losses to just several thousand dollars, and no post-storm accidents took place. Strong winds snapped many light poles in the city, and trees and shrubs were broken or uprooted. As in Lake Worth, officials in West Palm Beach credited preparations and stringent building codes with reducing overall damage. The city had learned from previous experience with severe storms in 1926, 1928, and 1929. High tides eroded Ocean Boulevard at several spots and disrupted access to several bridges on the Lake Worth Lagoon. Winter estates and hotels on Palm Beach generally sustained little material damage, except to vegetation, and county properties went largely unscathed.|$|E
25|$|Advances {{in green}} <b>roof</b> {{technology}} {{have led to}} the development of new systems that do not fit into the traditional classification of green <b>roof</b> types. Comprehensive green <b>roofs</b> bring the most advantageous qualities of extensive and intensive green <b>roofs</b> together. Comprehensive green <b>roofs</b> support plant varieties typically seen in intensive green <b>roofs</b> at the depth and weight of an extensive green <b>roof</b> system.|$|R
50|$|Sloped <b>roofs</b> {{that are}} {{prevalent}} in the southeastern United States also pose a significant challenge for SCV <b>roofs.</b> Soil media erosion and poor plant establishment {{are the most common}} problems and can occur on any angle of sloped <b>roof</b> if not designed properly. Erosion blankets and green <b>roof</b> soil media stabilization products are used to mitigate the effects of sloped <b>roofs.</b> Flat <b>roofs</b> and low sloped <b>roofs</b> are conventional <b>roof</b> slopes by the building industry in the southeastern United States and allow for successful implementation of SCV <b>roofs.</b>|$|R
50|$|A hip <b>roof</b> is self-bracing, {{requiring}} less {{diagonal bracing}} than a gable <b>roof.</b> Hip <b>roofs</b> are thus much {{better suited for}} hurricane regions than gable <b>roofs.</b> Hip <b>roofs</b> have no large, flat, or slab-sided ends to catch wind and are inherently much more stable than gable <b>roofs.</b> However, for a hurricane region, the <b>roof</b> also has to be steep-sloped; at least 35 degrees from horizontal or steeper in slope is preferred. When wind flows over a shallow sloped hip <b>roof,</b> the <b>roof</b> can behave like an airplane wing. Lift is then created on the leeward side. The flatter the <b>roof,</b> the more likely this will happen. A steeper pitched hip <b>roof</b> tends to cause the wind to stall as it goes over the <b>roof,</b> breaking up the effect. If the <b>roof</b> slopes are less than 35 degrees from horizontal, the <b>roof</b> {{will be subject to}} uplift. Greater than 35 degrees, and not only does wind blowing over it encounter a stalling effect, but the <b>roof</b> is actually held down on the wall plate by the wind pressure.|$|R
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that forms on iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the <b>roofing</b> of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
5|$|Copper, zinc, tin, {{and lead}} are {{mechanically}} weaker metals but have useful corrosion prevention properties. While {{each of them}} will react with air, the resulting patinas of either various copper salts, zinc carbonate, tin oxide, or a mixture of lead oxide, carbonate, and sulfate, confer valuable protective properties. Copper and lead are therefore used, for example, as <b>roofing</b> materials; zinc acts as an anti-corrosion agent in galvanised steel; and tin serves a similar purpose on steel cans.|$|E
5|$|Coral Ridge Properties {{established}} strict landscaping {{and sign}} laws for the city—a {{question in the}} original version of Trivial Pursuit noted that the city hosted the first McDonald's without the distinctive Golden Arches sign. Restrictions on commercial signs, exterior paint colors, <b>roofing</b> materials, recreational vehicle and boat storage, and landscaping specifications are all strictly enforced; consequently, real estate values in the city are {{significantly higher than the}} county as a whole. In 2006, the median price of a single family home in Coral Springs was US$415,000, while the median price county-wide was US$323,000.|$|E

Built in the Baroque style with yellow-rendered masonry and red tile <b>roofing,</b> the four-winged complex {{consists of a}} two-storey main wing, two one-storey lateral wings and a curved gate wing opening onto the Stændertorvet. The four wings are connected by curving galleries. Facing the courtyard, the façade of the main wing has pilasters and a median risalit tipped by a triangular pediment decorated with the royal coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|Early Medieval architecture's secular {{buildings}} were simple constructions mainly using timber with thatch for <b>roofing.</b> Ecclesiastical architecture {{ranged from a}} synthesis of Hiberno—Saxon monasticism, to Early Christian basilica and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various Castles in England were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion. Some of the best-known medieval castles are the Tower of London, Warwick Castle, Durham Castle and Windsor Castle.|$|E
5|$|European {{visitors}} in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they very effectively defended with bows and arrows. They {{were the only}} ethnic group encountered by the European party that had built a bridge. Homes were made of plant material; the Sihanaka believed building homes in brick or clay would invite the displeasure of the ancestors. Gendered roles factored into house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build {{the frame of the}} house and roof, as well as the windows and doors and their frames, while women wove zozoro reed mats that would serve as walls, flooring and <b>roofing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Modern timber <b>roofs</b> {{are mostly}} framed with pairs of common rafters or {{prefabricated}} wooden trusses fastened together with truss connector plates. Timber framed and historic buildings may be framed with principal rafters or timber <b>roof</b> trusses. <b>Roofs</b> are also designated as warm or cold <b>roof</b> {{depending on how}} they are designed and built with regard to thermal building insulation and ventilation. The steepness or <b>roof</b> pitch of a sloped <b>roof</b> is determined primarily by the <b>roof</b> covering material and aesthetic design. Flat <b>roofs</b> actually slope up to approximately ten degrees to shed water. Flat <b>roofs</b> on houses are primarily found in arid regions.|$|R
