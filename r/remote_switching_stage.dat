50|$|A {{variation}} on the subharmonic mixer exists that has two <b>switching</b> <b>stages</b> is used to improved mixer gain in a direct downconversion receiver.

The second <b>switching</b> <b>stage</b> mixes the intermediate frequency to baseband. By connecting the two <b>switching</b> <b>stages</b> in series, current is reused and harmonic content from the first stage is fed into the second stage thereby improving the mixer gain.|$|R

5000|$|Normally, long-distance {{calls were}} billed locally. Since the [...] "trick" [...] {{required}} {{a long distance}} call {{to be placed in}} order to connect to the <b>remote</b> <b>switch,</b> it would be billed as usual. However, there were some types of calls that had either no billing, like calls to directory service, or for which the billing was reversed or billed to another number, like WATS lines (area code 800 numbers). By dialing one of these [...] "toll-free" [...] numbers, the caller was connected to a <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> as normal, but no billing record was made locally. The caller would then play the 2600 Hz tone into the line to return the <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> to on-hook, and then use a blue box to dial the number to which they really wanted to connect. The local Bell office would have no record of the call.|$|R
50|$|A key {{capability}} of a <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> {{is the ability}} to act in emergency standalone (ESA) mode, wherein local calls can still be placed even in the event that the connection between that remote and the host has been lost. In this mode, only local calling is available anyway, so the billing {{capability of}} the host switch is not required. ESA is increasingly available on digital loop carrier platforms as well as on purpose-built <b>remote</b> <b>switches</b> in order to improve the scope of their utility.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to dialing instructions, the system {{also included a}} number of other tones that represented various commands or status. 2600 Hz, the key to early phreaking, was the frequency of the tone sent by the long-distance switch indicating that the user had gone on-hook (hung up the phone). This normally resulted in the <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> also going on-hook, freeing the trunk for other uses. In order to make free lines easy to find, the 2600 Hz tone was continually played into free trunks. If the tone was sent manually by the local user into the phone line, it would trigger the <b>remote</b> <b>switch</b> to go on-hook, but critically, the local switch knew he was still off-hook because that was signaled electrically, not by the tone (which their local switch ignored). The system was now in an inconsistent state, leaving the local user connected to an operational long-distance trunk line. With further experimentation, the phreaks learned the rest of the signals needed to dial on the <b>remote</b> <b>switch.</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{shows the}} {{technique}} of how to connect the required appliances with the local PC. Through proper software programs, the connection can be brought up to the web page to allow remote access for monitoring as well as <b>remote</b> control <b>switching</b> of the desired appliances. The system hardware consists of a control unit to detect the appliance's status and to drive the appliance running either the on or the off state. The system software enables the PC to receive appliance's status data. It also sends control signals to switch the appliance to the desired operating state. When operating the PCs through the web network, the server and client mode plus the TCP/IP programming technique are essential and important. The DART Company TCP/IP driver for Microsoft Win 95 / 98 has been adopted in our system to provide the network connections for the connected PCs. During operation, the DART Company's TCP/IP driver is applied and the desired DART functions are called to implement the data transmission and receiving through the Internet in a smooth and secure manner. A physical unit based on the configuration has been built and tested. The unit works reliably and the response time for the <b>remote</b> <b>switching</b> through the Internet is only 2 - 3 seconds or less.
