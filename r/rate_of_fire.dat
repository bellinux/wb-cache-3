5|$|The {{range of}} light and medium-calibre guns was limited, and {{accuracy}} declined badly at longer range. At longer ranges {{the advantage of a}} high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> decreased; accurate shooting depended on spotting the shell-splashes of the previous salvo, which limited the optimum <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume of fire, autocannon {{are limited by}} the amount of ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, to extend the amount of time they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the GSh-6-30K, which has a <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> of over 6,000rounds per minute.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to retain muzzle-loaders until the 1880s has been criticised by historians. However, {{at least until}} the late 1870s, the British muzzle-loaders had superior performance in terms of both range and <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> than the French and Prussian breech-loaders, which suffered from the same problems as had the first Armstrong guns.|$|E
50|$|Notably, one of {{the ways}} animal nervous systems {{represent}} sensory and other information is through rate coding whereby the magnitude of the signal is related to the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> the sensory neuron. In direct analogy, each neural event - called an action potential - represents one bit (pulse), with the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> the neuron representing the pulse density.|$|R

5|$|An autocannon is {{a cannon}} {{with a larger}} caliber than a machine gun, but smaller {{than that of a}} field gun. Autocannons have {{mechanisms}} to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a faster <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> than artillery, often approaching—and, in the case of Gatling guns, surpassing—that of a machine gun. The traditional minimum bore for autocannon—indeed, for all types of cannon, as autocannon are the lowest-caliber pieces—has remained 20mm, since World War II.|$|E
5|$|By World War I, all of {{the major}} powers were experimenting with {{aircraft}} mounted cannon; however their low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and great size and weight precluded any of them from being anything other than experimental. The most successful (or least unsuccessful) was the SPAD 12 Ca.1 with a single 37mm Puteaux mounted to fire between the cylinder banks and through the propeller boss of the aircraft's Hispano-Suiza 8C. The pilot (by necessity an ace) had to manually reload each round.|$|E
5|$|Gunnery {{developments}} in the late 1890s and the early 1900s, led in the United Kingdom by Percy Scott and in the United States by William Sims, were already pushing expected battle ranges out to an unprecedented , a distance great enough to force gunners {{to wait for the}} shells to arrive before applying corrections for the next salvo. A related problem was that the shell splashes from the more numerous smaller weapons tended to obscure the splashes from the bigger guns. Either the smaller-calibre guns would have to hold their fire to wait for the slower-firing heavies, losing the advantage of their faster <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> or it would be uncertain whether a splash was due to a heavy or a light gun, making ranging and aiming unreliable. Another problem was that longer-range torpedoes were expected to soon be in service and these would discourage ships from closing to ranges where the smaller guns' faster <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> would become preeminent. Keeping the range open generally negated the threat from torpedoes and further reinforced the need for heavy guns of a uniform calibre.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch Navy {{had already}} {{acquired}} {{a quantity of}} the Hispano Suiza 20mm guns before the war for mounting in torpedo boats and other craft and 6 of these were mounted in the cruiser Jacob van Heemskerck when she made her escape to Britain in 1940. The Hispano fired similar 20 × 110 ammunition to the Oerlikon but had a higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and slightly higher muzzle velocity. The Hispano Suiza however was to prove insufficiently durable for shipboard use and would find its niche as a highly successful aircraft gun.|$|E
5|$|The F-20 {{would have}} been able to use most of the common weapons in U.S.'s inventory, {{including}} the entire range of Mark 80 series bombs, the AGM-65 Maverick air-to-ground missile, and the AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missiles. Like the earlier F-5s, the test F-20s were equipped with two M39 cannon mounted in the nose. Production F-20s may have substituted two Ford Aerospace Tigerclaw cannons instead of the M39s; while the Tigerclaw was based on the M39, it was lighter and had a higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> than the M39A2.|$|E
5|$|The Tosa-class {{ships were}} {{intended}} to be armed with a main battery of ten 45-caliber 41-centimeter guns in five twin turrets, four of which were superfiring fore and aft. Numbered one through five from front to rear, the hydraulically powered turrets had an elevation range of −2 to +35 degrees. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> for the guns was around two rounds per minute. The ships were designed to carry 90 rounds per gun, although space was available for 110.|$|E

5|$|The ships {{also carried}} twelve 8.8cm (3.45in) SK L/30 quick-firing guns, also mounted in casemates. These guns were {{supplied}} with between 170 and 250 shells per gun. These guns fired 13.8kg (30.4lb) at a muzzle velocity of 590m/s (1,936ft/s). Their <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> was approximately 15 shells per minute; the guns could engage targets out to 10,500m (11,480yd). The gun mounts were manually operated. The ships' gun armament was rounded out by twelve machine guns.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} cordite handling, {{the battle was}} mostly inconclusive, though both the British {{flagship}} Lion and Seydlitz were severely damaged. Lion lost speed, causing her to fall behind {{the rest of the}} battleline, and Beatty was unable to effectively command his ships {{for the remainder of the}} engagement. A British signalling error allowed the German battlecruisers to withdraw, as most of Beatty's squadron mistakenly concentrated on the crippled armoured cruiser Blücher, sinking her with great loss of life. The British blamed their failure to win a decisive victory on their poor gunnery and attempted to increase their <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> by stockpiling unprotected cordite charges in their ammunition hoists and barbettes.|$|E
5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} firing mode, {{similar to that}} of a machine gun. They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a higher <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> than artillery, often approaching, or, in the case of rotary autocannons, even surpassing the firing rate of a machine gun. While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition.|$|E
25|$|Transduction {{involves}} chemical messages {{sent from}} the photoreceptors to the bipolar cells to the ganglion cells. Several photoreceptors may send their information to one ganglion cell. There {{are two types}} of ganglion cells: red/green and yellow/blue. These neuron cells constantly fire—even when not stimulated. The brain interprets different colors (and with a lot of information, an image) when the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> these neurons alters. Red light stimulates the red cone, which in turn stimulates the red/green ganglion cell. Likewise, green light stimulates the green cone, which stimulates the red/green ganglion cell and blue light stimulates the blue cone which stimulates the yellow/blue ganglion cell. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> the ganglion cells is increased when it is signaled by one cone and decreased (inhibited) when it is signaled by the other cone. The first color {{in the name of the}} ganglion cell is the color that excites it and the second is the color that inhibits it. i.e.: A red cone would excite the red/green ganglion cell and the green cone would inhibit the red/green ganglion cell. This is an opponent process. If the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> <b>of</b> a red/green ganglion cell is increased, the brain would know that the light was red, if the rate was decreased, the brain would know that the color of the light was green.|$|R
25|$|The {{cardiovascular}} centres receive {{input from}} a series of visceral receptors with impulses traveling through visceral sensory fibers within the vagus and sympathetic nerves via the cardiac plexus. Among these receptors are various proprioreceptors, baroreceptors, and chemoreceptors, plus stimuli from the limbic system which normally enable the precise regulation of heart function, via cardiac reflexes. Increased physical activity results in increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> by various proprioreceptors located in muscles, joint capsules, and tendons. The cardiovascular centres monitor these increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing,</b> suppressing parasympathetic stimulation or increasing sympathetic stimulation as needed in order to increase blood flow.|$|R
50|$|Most late-19th-century {{warships}} mounted naval artillery of {{more than}} one caliber because of uncertainty about the relative destruction possible from a few large shells (which might miss) in comparison to the increased hit probability of a larger number of less damaging small-caliber shells fired within the same time period. Quick-firing guns were initially breech-loading weapons firing ammunition small enough to be loaded by hand. Later substitution of brass cartridges for silk powder bags allowed increased <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> using sliding wedge breech blocks. Increasing mechanization ultimately enabled similar <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> from naval artillery calibers up to 8 in.|$|R
5|$|Courageous carried four BL 15-inch Mk I guns in two {{hydraulically}} powered twin gun turrets, designated 'A' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4-inch Mk IX guns mounted in six manually powered mounts. The mount placed three breeches too close together, causing the 23 loaders to get in one another's way, and preventing the intended high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> A pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast the mainmast on Courageous. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and carried 10 torpedoes for them.|$|E
5|$|Glorious carried four BL 15-inch (381mm) Mark I guns in two twin-gun turrets, {{one each}} fore ('A') and aft ('Y'). Her {{secondary}} armament was 18 BL 4-inch (102mm) Mark IX guns mounted in six triple mounts. These mounts had the three breeches too close {{together and the}} 23 loaders tended to interfere with one another. This negated the mount's intended high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> against torpedo boats and other smaller craft. A pair of QF 3-inch (76mm) 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast of the mainmast on Glorious. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried.|$|E
5|$|The M249 {{light machine}} gun (LMG), {{formerly}} designated the M249 Squad Automatic Weapon (SAW) and formally written as Light Machine Gun, 5.56mm, M249, is the American adaptation of the Belgian FN Minimi, a {{light machine gun}} manufactured by the Belgian company FN Herstal (FN). The M249 is manufactured in the United States by the local subsidiary FN Manufacturing LLC in South Carolina and is widely used in the U.S. Armed Forces. The weapon was introduced in 1984 after being judged the most effective {{of a number of}} candidate weapons to address the lack of automatic firepower in small units. The M249 provides infantry squads with the high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> of a machine gun combined with accuracy and portability approaching that of a rifle.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, baroreceptors are stretch receptors {{located in}} the aortic sinus, carotid bodies, the venae cavae, and other locations, {{including}} pulmonary vessels and {{the right side of}} the heart itself. <b>Rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>firing</b> from the baroreceptors represent blood pressure, level of physical activity, and the relative distribution of blood. The cardiac centers monitor baroreceptor firing to maintain cardiac homeostasis, a mechanism called the baroreceptor reflex. With increased pressure and stretch, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> baroreceptor <b>firing</b> increases, and the cardiac centers decrease sympathetic stimulation and increase parasympathetic stimulation. As pressure and stretch decrease, the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> baroreceptor <b>firing</b> decreases, and the cardiac centers increase sympathetic stimulation and decrease parasympathetic stimulation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on the {{principle}} of oxygen consumption, relationship between heat release <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> coach <b>fire</b> and ventilation factor is studied. The peak heat release <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> coach <b>fire</b> is estimated under four typical ventilation conditions: one window, two windows, four windows and all windows <b>of</b> the <b>fire</b> coach are opened, respectively. Results were compared with the predictions by traditional empirical formulas for flashover in confined space. A suitable calculation method for forecasting the heat release <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> coach <b>fire</b> is presented. CFD means were also applied to simulate and analyze the impact of the ventilation factor on the burning characteristics <b>of</b> coach <b>fire.</b> The results indicate that the calculation method can predict the heat release <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> coach <b>fire</b> well. The peak heat release <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> coach <b>fire</b> is proportional to the ventilation factor. The calculation results are 6. 3 MW, 8. 4 MW, 12. 6 MW and 39. 7 MW and simulation results are 6. 5 MW, 9. 9 MW, 14. 8 MW and 39 MW respectively under different ventilation conditions in this study. The results also show that the heat release <b>rate</b> and <b>of</b> coach <b>fire</b> increases with the increase of ventilation factor...|$|R

5|$|The P90 is a {{selective}} fire, straight blowback-operated weapon with a cyclic <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> of 900 RPM (rounds per minute). The weapon is chambered for FN's 5.7×28mm ammunition. Its unusual shape {{is based on}} extensive ergonomic research. The weapon is grasped {{by means of a}} thumbhole in the frame that acts as a pistol grip, as well as an oversized trigger guard that acts as a foregrip for the shooter's support hand. The P90 fires from a closed bolt for maximum accuracy, and its design makes extensive use of polymers for reduced weight and cost. Overall, the weapon is relatively lightweight, weighing 2.5kg (5.6lb) empty, or 3kg (6.6lb) with a loaded 50-round magazine.|$|E
5|$|The {{arsenal of}} weapons {{includes}} pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, grenades, and throwing knives, among others. Guns have a finite magazine {{and must be}} reloaded after {{a certain number of}} shots, but the player may acquire and carry as many weapons as can be found in each mission. The player's initial weapon in most missions is James Bond's Walther PPK, called the PP7 special issue in-game. Most of the game's firearms are modelled on real-life counterparts (although their names are altered), while others are based on fictitious devices featured in the Bond films, such as the Golden Gun and Moonraker laser. The weapons vary in characteristics such as <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire,</b> degree of penetration, and type of ammunition used, and inflict different levels of damage depending on which body part they hit.|$|E
5|$|The defence was {{supported}} by a strong artillery component that included 41 Breda Model 35 20mm antiaircraft guns; 85 47mm antitank guns; 26 Solothurn S-18/1000 anti-tank rifles; 41 Cannone da 65/17 modello 13 65mm infantry support guns; 147 Cannone da 75/32 modello 37 75mm and 77mm field guns; 76 Skoda 100 mm Model 1916 and Canon de 105 mle 1913 Schneider 105mm guns; and 27 120mm and Obice da 149/12 modello 14 149mm medium howitzers. The large number of different gun models, many of them quite old, created difficulties with the supply of spare parts. The older guns often had worn barrels, which caused problems with accuracy. Ammunition stocks were similarly old and perhaps as many as two-thirds of the fuses were out of date, resulting in excessive numbers of dud rounds. There were also multiple models of machine guns, with seven different types of ammunition in use. The Breda 30, the principal light machine gun, had a low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire</b> and a reputation for jamming. The Fiat-Revelli Modello 1914 was a bulky and complicated weapon that was also prone to stoppages. Some of these had been rebuilt as Fiat-Revelli Modello 1935s which, while an improvement, were still unreliable. The principal medium machine gun, the Breda M37, had its shortcomings, the main one being that it used 20-round strips of cartridges, which gave it a reduced <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>fire.</b> Shortages of raw materials, coupled with the increased technological sophistication of modern weapons, led to production problems that frustrated efforts to supply the entire Italian Army with the best available equipment. The result was that the firepower of the Italian defenders was neither as great nor as effective as it should have been.|$|E
5000|$|... {{is called}} the cyclic rate. In fully {{automatic}} firearms the cyclic rate is tailored to the purpose that the gun is made to serve.
