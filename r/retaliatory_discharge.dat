[...] "Public policy comes in many variations, is implicated in many contexts, and is carried out by many people, both publicly and privately. Once expanded in the manner argued here, the public policy exception would no longer be subject to any discernable limiting principles. It would arguably apply to <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharges</b> based upon the conduct of any non-employee relative, for the fulfillment of or refusal to violate public policy {{in a wide variety of}} ways and in a manner completely unconnected to the employment relationship. The public policy exception cannot be stretched that far and still be recognizable under Brockmeyer's limited formulation." ...|$|R

5000|$|Congress also {{recognized}} that the employee's protection against having to choose between operating an unsafe vehicle and losing his job would lack practical effectiveness if the U.S. 252, 259 employee could not be reinstated pending complete review. The longer a discharged employee remains unemployed, the more devastating are the consequences to his personal financial condition and prospects for reemployment. Ensuring the eventual recovery of backpay may not alone provide sufficient protection to encourage reports of safety violations. Accordingly, 405 incorporates additional protections, authorizing temporary reinstatement based on a preliminary finding of reasonable cause {{to believe that the}} employee has suffered a <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharge.</b> The statute reflects a careful balancing of the relative interests of the Government, employee, and employer. It evidences a legislative determination that the preliminary investigation and finding of reasonable cause by the Secretary, if followed [...] "expeditiously" [...] by a hearing on the record at the employer's request, provide effective protection to the employee and ensure fair consideration of the employer's interest in making unimpaired hiring decisions.|$|E
40|$|This Note advocates {{that federal}} courts should allow {{attorneys}} to bring <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharge</b> claims under SOX. Traditional rationales prohibiting {{the claims of}} <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharge</b> by attorneys do not apply {{in the context of}} Sarbanes-Oxley. This Note contends that the Department of Labor and the federal courts should interpret the whistleblower provisions of § 806 as protecting attorneys who report under § 307. Assuring reporting attorneys that they have protection from retaliation will encourage them to whistleblow and thereby advance SOX 2 ̆ 7 s policy goal of ferreting out corporate fraud. Part I explores the legal landscape of <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharge</b> suits by attorneys. This Part examines the rationales of the traditional view, the limited-claim view, and the wide-open view. Part II considers whether reporting attorneys are protected as 2 ̆ 2 employees 2 ̆ 2 under the whistleblower provisions of § 806. This Part argues that, based on plain meaning, statutory purpose, legislative history, and policy considerations, courts should interpret § 806 as covering attorneys reporting under § 307 to carry out the substantive goal of SOX. Part III counters the common law 2 ̆ 7 s traditional view that has denied <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharge</b> claims by whistleblower-attorneys. This Part argues that the legislative goal of Sarbanes-Oxley to combat corporate fraud takes precedence over common law policies of preserving the traditional attorney-client relationship. This Part also rebuts the traditional rationale that attorneys already bound by ethical obligations do not need additional support to whistleblow, and instead, contends that strong economic and psychological incentives encourage attorneys to sidestep the reporting requirements...|$|E
40|$|In Trosper v. Bag 2 ̆ 7 N Save, the Nebraska Supreme Court {{addressed}} {{whether an}} employee 2 ̆ 7 s demotion for seeking compensation rightfully owed {{him under the}} State 2 ̆ 7 s workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation laws falls within the State 2 ̆ 7 s public policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine. Already having recognized a public policy exception when an employee is discharged for seeking compensation under the State 2 ̆ 7 s workers 2 ̆ 7 compensation laws, the specific issue facing the Court was whether retaliatory demotion should be protected {{to the same extent}} as <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharge.</b> Part II of this Note provides the background law relevant to Trosper. Section A offers a brief synopsis on Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s at-will employment doctrine and application of the public policy exception. Section B summarizes the majority, concurring, and dissenting opinions in Trosper. Section C addresses case law from other jurisdictions that the Court extensively relied on in Trosper. The crux of this Note is the Analysis contained in Part III, which is broken into two closely related sections. Section A contends that Trosper reached the proper conclusion by holding that a private right of action for retaliatory demotion is necessary when a private right of action for <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharge</b> has already been recognized, but recognizes that doing so inserts ambiguity into the law. Section B seeks to resolve that ambiguity by providing a guidebook for courts and employers dealing with the nebulous concept of retaliatory demotion. Part IV offers some concluding thoughts on how courts and employers should address the post-Trosper ambiguity...|$|E
40|$|On April 5, 1996, Motel 6 hired Juanita Pope as a housekeeper. Within several months, Motel 6 {{promoted}} Ms. Pope to {{the position}} of head housekeeper. However, within the first fourteen months of Ms. Pope’s employment she was written up, warned, and suspended multiple times for tardiness and unsatisfactory job performance. In June 1997, Victoria Inman, manager of the Motel 6 where Ms. Pope worked, issued a verbal warning to Ms. Pope, telling her that she was to stop gossiping to other Motel 6 employees. Inman explained to Ms. Pope that such conduct was inappropriate for somebody in a management position, such as head of housekeeping. Allegedly, Ms. Pope continued to say negative things about Inman, and Motel 6 in general. Subsequently, after consulting Motel 6 ’s regional human resource manager, Inman terminated Ms. Pope’s employment. In support of the decision to terminate Ms. Pope’s employment, Inman produced written statements from three other Motel 6 employees, alleging that Ms. Pope spoke poorly of both Inman and Motel 6. Ms. Pope contended that following her termination, Inman falsely accused both her and her husband, who also previously worked for Motel 6, of stealing several items from Motel 6. In addition, Ms. Pope alleged that Inman falsely accused her and her husband of writing threatening letters to Inman. Ms. Pope claimed that Inman made these false allegations to the local police, as well as a Motel 6 area manager. After Ms. Pope’s employment was terminated, she filed a discrimination charge with the Nevada Equal Rights Commission (NERC). The charge asserted that Motel 6 terminated her employment because of previous incidents with her husband. Ms. Pope claimed that she was fired because her husband, during his employment with Motel 6, had complained about a sexual harassment incident at Motel 6, and because he had filed a NERC charge, alleging <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharge,</b> after Motel 6 terminated his employment. After filing a NERC charge, Ms. Pope filed a complaint in district court. In the complaint Ms. Pope alleged several causes of action. In particular, Ms. Pope brought the following claims: (1) wrongful termination based on race or national origin, (2) failure to promote based on race or national origin, (3) retaliatory termination, (4) defamation, and (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress. However, after pretrial discovery, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Motel 6, dismissing all of Ms. Pope’s causes of action. Ms. Pope appealed the district court’s ruling. On appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court held that because Ms. Pope only alleged <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharge</b> in her NERC charge (with no allegations of discrimination), she had not exhausted all administrative remedies before filing her discrimination claim in district court. Furthermore, the court held that Nevada’s anti-retaliation statute did not apply to Ms. Pope because she was not the individual who engaged in the protected activity. In other words, because Ms. Pope alleged <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharge</b> based solely on her husband’s past conduct, she could not prevail on the claim. Lastly, the court held the district court had properly granted Motel 6 ’s motion for summary judgment, regarding Inman’s remarks to the police, because Ms. Pope failed to advance any evidence of malice, a requisite element for defamation. However, the court held the district court erroneously granted Motel 6 ’s motion for summary judgment regarding Inman’s statements to the area manager. The court reasoned that because Motel 6 failed to show that Inman’s comments to the area manager were intracorporate privileged communications, the district court was incorrect in granting summary judgment...|$|E
40|$|Many {{employers}} {{have been reluctant}} to provide reference information for former employees because they fear being sued for defamation or <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharge.</b> To avoid being held liable, {{employers have}} grown accustomed to withholding relevant information about a former employee and instead only giving information such as the person’s rank in the company and the number of years they worked. This is known as the “name, rank, and serial number ” policy. Not only could this be harmful to the potential employer, but it can also affect how employees perform on the job since they know their record does not follow them. Many states have recognized the detrimental effect this can have on employers and employees alike. Over 38 states have now passed statutes granting some sort of immunity to employers who provide truthful, relevant information about a former employee, and many other states are considering similar legislation. This paper discusses how the reference immunity statutes differ from the common law and then goes on to discuss various components of the statutes point by point. It also looks at the statutes’ effectiveness and explores various reasons for their ineffectiveness. Finally, it will attempt to find a balanced solution for the state of Nebraska to encourage a free flow of information between employers and increase the quality of references. ...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} {{varieties}} of the “originalist” school of constitutional thought, but all subscribe in {{one degree or another}} {{to the belief}} that a constitutional clause should be interpreted according to its original meaning or the original intent of its authors. That original understanding or intent can be discerned from the text of the clause, the history of its drafting and ratification and, sometimes, early practices and court decisions interpreting that clause. It rightly has been called a “grand theory” because it is simple and clear, explains so much, and it has the almost irresistible attraction of being anchored firmly in history, a past illuminated by the writings and speeches of heroic figures [...] the “founding fathers. ” Like frontier settlers in the novels of O. E. Rölvaag, lawyers, legal scholars and jurists who attempt to interpret Minnesota 2 ̆ 7 s Constitution {{on the basis of its}} original understanding or the framers 2 ̆ 7 intent encounter unexpected hardships, hazards, and deprivations. This article explores practical reasons why a strict originalist interpretation of the Minnesota Constitution has never taken hold, and probably never will. It does not address the worthiness of the originalist school of adjudication at all. It is both provoked and inspired by an essay published in these pages a year ago by Professor Russell Pannier on the decision of the Minnesota Supreme Court in the case of Abraham v. Hennepin County. There, the court held that an employee claiming <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharge</b> under the state “whistleblower act” had a right to a jury trial under Article 1, section 4 of the Minnesota Constitution. Professor Pannier concluded that the Abraham court attempted to ride “originalist” and “non-originalist” horses in the same race; not mincing words, he found the court 2 ̆ 7 s reasoning “incoherent” and “internally inconsistent. ” But there is another view of Abraham, that with it, the court boldly built a contemporary structure for the analysis of the jury right that is faithful to the democratic order and harmonious with this state 2 ̆ 7 s constitutional past...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{review the}} facts and legal {{rationale}} of a lawsuit in which a hospital was held liable for discharging a pharmacy technician from employment. Summary: The hospital and the pharmacy technician previously had disagreed about several matters. The technician believed he was being discrirninated against based on his need {{to be away from}} work to serve in the National Guard. On one occasion, the technician reported to work {{in what appeared to be}} a drug-impaired state. The technician subsequently was discharged from employment. He sued, contending that the discharge was in retaliation for his asserting his rights as a National Guard member. The technician won the lawsuit. Conclusions: Employment law bends over backward to protect employees. When an employee is not licensed, the only effective peer review is within the employment relationship. The public may not be effectively protected from harm that might be caused by employees who are not competent. Strong laws that protect employees restrict the ability of employers to oversee employee conduct. Therefore, for employees whose incompetence may pose a threat to the public, licensure provides a necessary additional level of protection. / Pharm Technol 1994; 10 : 61 - 3. The issue of licensure for pharmacy technicians is fre quently discussed in pharmacy circles, but it defies easy resolution. Licensure differs from certification. Through licensure, society conveys an exclusive right to practice, and forbids the use of unlicensed personnel. Certification simply means that a person is deemed minimally quali fied, but it is possible to use uncertified personnel as long as they do not claim to be certified. A lawsuit brought by a pharmacy technician against a hospital serves as background for a discussion of the technician licensure issue. The technician filed a lawsuit against the hospital that had formerly employed him, al leging breach of an employment contract and <b>retaliatory</b> <b>discharge.</b> The case was tried before a jury that found for the technician, and awarded him $ 55, 700. 29 in damages for lost wages, $ 50, 000. 00 for emotional distress, and $ 125, 000. 00 in punitive damages. 1 The pharmacy technician had begun working at th...|$|E
