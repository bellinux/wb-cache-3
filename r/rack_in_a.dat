Each pad has a sensor that generates an electric signal when struck.|$|E
2500|$|Blair {{liked to}} carry out {{practical}} jokes. Buddicom recalls him swinging from the luggage <b>rack</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> railway carriage like an orangutan to frighten a woman passenger out of the compartment. At Eton he played tricks on John Crace, his Master in College, among which was to enter a spoof advertisement in a College magazine implying pederasty. Gow, his tutor, said he [...] "made himself as big a nuisance as he could" [...] and [...] "was a very unattractive boy". Later Blair was expelled from the crammer at Southwold for sending a dead rat as a birthday present to the town surveyor. In one of his As I Please essays he refers to a protracted joke when he answered an advertisement {{for a woman who}} claimed a cure for obesity.|$|E

At {{the end of}} the {{corridor}} was an elevator in which they were shot to one of the upper floors; and the boy, inserting a key in a heavy mahogany door, revealed a sitting-room. Between its windows was a table covered with a long, white cloth reaching to the floor, on which, amidst the silverware and glass, was set a tall vase filled with dusky roses. Janet, drawing in a deep breath of their fragrance, glanced around the room. The hangings, the wall-paper, the carpet, the velvet upholstery of the mahogany chairs, of the wide lounge in the corner were of a deep and restful green; the marble mantelpiece, with its English coal grate, was copied--had she known it--from a mansion of the Georgian period. The hands of a delicate Georgian clock pointed to one. And in the large mirror behind the clock she beheld an image she supposed, dreamily, to be herself. The bell boy was taking off her coat, which he hung, with Ditmar's, on a <b>rack</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corner.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{the high}} density of servers <b>racks</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> data center, often cabling and IP {{addresses}} are an issue.

As ASHRAE recommends up to 6 temperature sensors per rack, meshed wireless temperature technology gives an advantage compared to traditional cabled sensors.|$|R

50|$|Reduction of {{the beans}} to 25-30% {{moisture}} by weight, to prevent rotting and {{to lock the}} aroma in the pods, is always achieved by some exposure of the beans to air, and usually (and traditionally) intermittent shade and sunlight.

Drying is the most problematic of the curing stages; unevenness in the drying process can lead to the loss of vanillin content of some fruits by the time the others are cured.|$|E
5000|$|Installing and {{deploying}} large covers can be labour-intensive task.

Advances in the newer Protex GymPro products allow for smaller storage racks while the newer tile systems are stacked on compact platform trucks for storage and transport. Dual cleaning brush assemblies (to remove debris) and electric power winders (to reduce manual labor during cover removal) are normally used to efficiently maintain the covers while the carpet based gym covers are best cleaned using the Host Cleaning method with the covers still in place.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} the relationship between bicycle ridership and bike <b>racks</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given area. The goal was to discern whether or not the density of bike racks determines the number of riders in the area. I predicted that there would be higher ridership in the areas with a denser bike rack concentration. To investigate this point, I set up five different areas of varying sizes with a similar number of bike racks, and then observed them over a period of 5 business days. By using a simple tally of the bikes found on the racks and bikes locked to other objects, like railings, I collected data in the area during the day when there were likely to be many commuter bikes parked outside. The results show that there is a positive relationship between the density of bike <b>racks</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> given area and bike ridership. While there is a positive r-value, more data collection {{needs to be done to}} determine the relationship that may exist between bike ridership and bike racks...|$|R
