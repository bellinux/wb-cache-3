40|$|Passenger {{car traffic}} {{is among the}} main {{contributors}} to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which are responsible for climate change. It {{is also an important}} indicator used to forecast these emissions in integrated climate-economic models. This paper develops scenarios for global passenger car stock until 2050. The study adopts a global <b>regionalized</b> <b>approach,</b> encompassing 11 world regions. Car stock projections are obtained using a multi-model approach, which includes a consumer demand model based on utility maximization, a non-linear Gompertz model and a panel estimate of the income elasticity of demand for cars. The main hypothesis underlying these projections is that preferences for purchasing cars are similar across cultures and nations and that the demand for cars is largely determined by disposable income. We apply scenarios for the average traffic volume and fuel efficiency developed in previous work together with the average carbon content of fuels to obtain the CO 2 emissions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The energy {{produced}} from {{the investment in}} biofuel crops needs {{to account for the}} environmental impacts on soil, water, climate change, and ecosystem services. A <b>regionalized</b> <b>approach</b> is needed to evaluate the environmental costs of large-scale biofuel production. We present a regional pan-European simulation of rapeseed (Brassica napus) cultivation. Rapeseed is the European Union's dominant biofuel crop with a share of about 80 % of the feedstock. To improve the assessment of the environmental impact of this biodiesel production, we performed a pan-European simulation of rapeseed cultivation at a 10 to 10 km scale with EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate; Williams, 1995). The model runs with a daily time step and model input consists of spatialized meteorological measurements, and topographic, soil, land use, and farm management practices data and information. Default EPIC model parameters were calibrated based on literature. Modelled rapeseed yields were satisfactory compared to yields at regional level reported for 151 regions obtained for the period from 1995 to 2003 for 27 European Union member countries, along with consistent modelled and reported yield responses to precipitation, radiation and vapour pressure deficit at regional level. The model is currently set up so that plant nutrient stress is not occurring. Total fertilizer consumption at country level was compared to IFA/FAO data. This approach allows us to evaluate environmental pressures and efficiencies arising from and associated with rapeseed cultivation to further complete the environmental balance of biofuel production and consumption.

40|$|An {{emerging}} {{branch of}} geocomputing involves the modelling of spatial processes. A variety of techniques are being used, {{the most important}} being traditional <b>regionalized</b> system dynamics <b>approaches,</b> multi-agent systems, and cellular automata (CA). The techniques are frequently combined to model processes operating at dierent spatial scales. Urban and regional models based on CA give good representations of the spatial dynamics of land use. In a current application, a cellular model of The Netherlands at 500 m resolution is driven by a macro-scale dynamical spatial interaction model defined on 40 economic regions; this model is in turn driven by national planning projections and policy goals. Given the national totals, the macro-scale model generates regional demands for population {{and a number of}} economic activities. These demands are translated into demands for cell space, which the CA then attempts to locate. In turn, information on conditions at the cellular level, such as the quan-tity and quality of land available to various activities and actual densities at the cellular scale, are returned to the regional model to modify parameter values there. Linking the two models operating at the two scales improves the performance of both. The results of high-resolutio...|$|R

Department of Energy Waste Management (WM) Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS). Available data on the physical form, chemical and isotopic composition, storage locations, and other waste characteristics of interest are presented. High-level waste management follows six implementation phases: current storage, retrieval, pretreatment, treatment, interim canister storage, and geologic repository disposal; pretreatment, treatment, and repository disposal are {{outside the scope of}} the WM PEIS. Brief descriptions of current and planned HLW management facilities are provided, including information on the type of waste managed in the facility, costs, product form, resource requirements, emissions, and current and future status. Data sources and technical and regulatory assumptions are identified. The range of HLW management alternatives (including decentralized, <b>regionalized,</b> and centralized <b>approaches)</b> is described. The required waste management facilities include expanded interim storage facilities under the various alternatives. Resource requirements for construction (e. g., land and materials) and operation (e. g., energy and process chemicals), work force, costs, effluents, design capacities, and emissions are presented for each alternative...|$|R
40|$|Data from {{randomized}} clinical trials, non-randomized studies, and registries, {{as well as}} {{expert panel}} consensus are appropriately weighted and woven into the context of clinical practice guidelines. Recent guidelines {{for the care of}} patients with ischemic heart disease have emphasized both risk stratification and early coronary angiography with revascularization of patients with high-risk indicators. Advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes and the dynamics of therapeutic innovation (improvement in catheter-based technologies and adjunctive pharmacotherapy) mandate the timely update and revision of practice guidelines. We believe that the weight of evidence remains clearly in support of an early invasive treatment strategy based on risk stratification. Arguments regarding treatment strategy (invasive vs. conservative) are misguided, and greater focus should be placed on improving the treatment-risk paradox demonstrated in clinical practice as well as on strategies to enhance current guideline compliance and utilization. Interest exists in establishing regional centers of excellence for care of patients with acute ischemic heart disease, analogous to the <b>regionalized</b> <b>approach</b> already established for patients with trauma or stroke. This approach is supported by data that demonstrate an inverse relationship between both institutional and operator procedural volumes and mortality, as well as by existing constraints in resources such as specialized nurses and subspecialty-trained physicians. It is appropriate at this time to briefly review specific aspects of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association practice guidelines and the current process of care for acute ischemic heart disease...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The cost {{of trauma}} center care is high, raising {{questions}} {{about the value of}} a <b>regionalized</b> <b>approach</b> to trauma care. To address these concerns, we estimate 1 -year and lifetime treatment costs and measure the cost-effectiveness of treatment at a Level I trauma center (TC) compared with a nontrauma center hospital (NTC). METHODS: Estimates of cost-effectiveness were derived using data on 5, 043 major trauma patients enrolled in the National Study on Costs and Outcomes of Trauma, a prospective cohort study of severely injured adult patients cared for in 69 hospitals in 14 states. Data on costs were derived from multiple sources including claims data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, UB 92 hospital bills, and patient interviews. Cost-effectiveness was estimated as the ratio of the difference in costs (for treatment at a TC vs. NTC) divided by the difference in life years gained (and lives saved). We also measured cost-effectiveness per quality-adjusted life year gained where quality of life was measured using the SF- 6 D. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for observable differences between patients treated at TCs and NTCs. RESULTS: The added cost for treatment at a TC versus NTC was $ 36, 319 per life-year gained ($ 790, 931 per life saved) and $ 36, 961 per quality-adjusted life years gained. Cost-effectiveness was more favorable for patients with injuries of higher versus lower severity and for younger versus older patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide evidence that regionalization of trauma care is not only effective but also it is cost-effective...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings of the 1999 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 30 and 31, Athens, Georgia. Lake Oglethorpe, a small {{impoundment}} located east of Athens in Oglethorpe County, Georgia, {{has been}} extensively studied since 1978. It currently provides a test base for some of our methods in on-going research into the long-term ecological integrity of nearby Lake Lanier. In this paper, we present {{the basic structure of}} a total ecosystem model being developed for simulating ecological processes in lake communities, and a <b>regionalized</b> sensitivity analysis <b>approach</b> for evaluating the model's constituent hypotheses. We hypothesize that long-term changes in the behavior of Lake Oglethorpe will be governed by slowly evolving processes - specifically the sediment-water interactions and fish population dynamics - typified by the timeconstants within the model. We present some preliminary results of our assessment of the significant ecological processes responsible for shaping the past and future behavior of Lake Oglethorpe. Sponsored and Organized by: U.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The Oregon Coast's small water systems, {{like the}} {{vast number of}} small water systems across the U. S., are greatly vulnerable. Failing infrastructure, limited {{financial}} capital, and inadequate staff combined with future changes in climate, population size, and regulatory stringency spell out a potentially dire future for the region's water supply and subsequently, its economy. To address small water system vulnerability, partnerships (i. e. <b>regionalized</b> and collaborative <b>approaches</b> to water management and delivery) have received increasing attention {{as a tool for}} improving managerial, technical, and financial capacities. But how do these relate to system adaptive capacity, i. e. the ability to respond and adjust to change? In an effort to evaluate regional partnerships and provide guidance to Oregon coastal water system managers as to how to appropriately use it, this study sets out to 1) assess the spectrum of water system partnership types through the framework of adaptive capacity; 2) identify likely drivers and barriers to partnership establishment and ways to overcome them; and 3) assemble recommendations and lessons learned for successful, adaptive capacity-building partnerships. This study suggests that partnerships do in fact increase adaptive capacity, and specifically, that more formalized partnership types (joint powers agencies and consolidations) provide the greatest adaptive capacity characteristics. The number of barriers far outweighed drivers, and recommendations for partnership success converged most commonly around the topic of fair governance. Recommended state actions, opportunities for financing, an evaluation of the adaptive capacity framework, and suggestions for further research are offered...|$|R
40|$|In its Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS), the Office of Environmental Management (EM) of the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) is {{considering}} {{a broad range of}} alternatives for the future management of radioactive and hazardous waste at the facilities of the DOE complex. The alternatives involve facilities to be used for treatment, storage, and disposal of various wastes generated from DOE environmental restoration activities and waste management operations. The evaluation includes five types of waste (four types of radioactive waste plus hazardous waste), 49 sites, and numerous cases associated with each alternative for waste management. In general, the alternatives are evaluated independently for each type of waste and reflect decentralized, <b>regionalized,</b> and centralized <b>approaches.</b> Transportation of waste materials is an integral component of the EM PEIS alternatives for waste management. The estimated impact on human health that is associated with various waste transportation activities is an important component of a complete appraisal of the alternatives. The transportation risk assessment performed for the EM PEIS is designed to ensure through uniform and judicious selection of models, data, and assumptions that relative comparisons of risk among the various alternatives are meaningful and consistent. Among other tasks, Argonne National Laboratory is providing technical assistance to the EM PEIS on transportation risk assessment. The objective is to perform a human health risk assessment for each type of waste relative to the EM PEIS alternatives for waste management. The transportation risk assessed is part of the overall impacts being analyzed for the EM PEIS to determine the safest, most environmentally and economically sound manner in which to satisfy requirements for waste management in the coming decades...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a <b>regionalized</b> vulnerability curve-building <b>approach</b> to vulnerability and risk assessment of wheat subjected to drought {{that uses the}} Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model and statistical analysis. We defined wheat vulnerability as {{the degree to which}} a wheat production system is likely to experience yield loss due to a perturbation or drought hazard. Wheat vulnerability in a given region is thus the yield loss divided by the drought hazard index (DHI). By simulating a variety of wheat yield losses and associated DHIs, wheat drought vulnerability curves can be developed. We propose that agricultural systems be considered uniform within each wheat-planting region and different in different regions, according to territorial differentiation, when regionalized vulnerability curves are built. Based on this principle, a detailed regional crop calendar was improved, and optimized wheat varieties were refined that can differentiate agricultural systems within wheat-planting regions. The crop calendar was improved based on the assumption that local farmers have perfect knowledge in selecting sowing and harvesting dates. The wheat varieties were optimized by adjusting the genetic parameters of wheat in the EPIC model using the Shuffled Complex Evolution algorithm-University of Arizona (SCE-UA) method. Based on these improvements and innovations, the precision of most vulnerability curves was improved, and the curves were compared favorably to those observed in previous studies related to differences in the genetic character of wheat, the crop calendar, environmental conditions, and other relevant factors. Differences within each region were smaller than differences between regions. More detailed wheat vulnerability curves allow for the assessment of expected wheat yield loss and also allow for a high level of precision in an evaluation, at a variety of scales, of risk of wheat subject to drought. The proposed <b>approach</b> to building <b>regionalized</b> vulnerability curves has the potential to be the basis for crop drought vulnerability curves in different geographical areas at multiple scales...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of an inclusive trauma {{system in the}} Netherlands during {{last decade of the}} past century, has led to an improvement in Dutch trauma care. Eleven trauma regions were formed nationwide each surrounding a level I trauma center. All hospitals in a trauma region were assigned levels I, II or III, and are working together in a trauma network. Also part of the {{introduction of}} the inclusive trauma system was the regionalization of individual ambulance care and the introduction of mobile medical teams. This <b>regionalized</b> trauma care <b>approach</b> has demonstrated its efficacy in terms of better triage and improved patient outcomes as well in the Netherlands as overseas. An optimal trauma system should at least incorporate legislation, designation, funding, cooperation and research. The best strategy is to prevent the injury from occurring in the first place. But when injury does occur the delivery of optimal trauma care represents a critical tertiary prevention strategy to prevent unnecessary death and disability. The trauma system should be a learning system framework for continual improvement in trauma care. Despite these improvements in trauma care and trauma outcome, trauma still is a leading cause of death in the western world. Every day, 16, 000 people die from injuries and for every person who dies, several thousand more are injured, many of them with permanent sequelae. Surprisingly, the public appears generally to be unaware that trauma {{is the leading cause of}} death for people under the age of 46. In the Netherlands trauma is associated with an economic cost of € 3. 5 billion annually, € 2. 0 billion due to healthcare costs and € 1. 5 billion due to loss of productivity. In the USA trauma is the number one cause of years of potential life lost before the age of 75. This loss is even greater than the loss due to either cancer or heart disease. Every year approximately 85, 000 patients are acutely admitted to hospital because of a trauma in the Netherlands, this is far more than the yearly number of acute admissions due to heart disease. Of these approximately 85, 000 patients, about 6, 000 patients are multiple injured (ISS ≥ 16) and 2, 000 are severely injured (ISS ≥ 25). For the first time since the 1970 ’s there has been an increase in traffic fatalities and the number of patients injured in traffic is growing since at least 15 years. Despite these facts the Netherlands, as most western countries, seems to have a blind spot for this trauma epidemic. This thesis has focused on several aspects of the trauma system, this to gain knowledge on how the different trauma system structures influence patient outcomes. The research was performed in two level I trauma centers and their trauma regions in the Netherlands, the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) in Utrecht and the Elisabeth-TweeSteden Hospital (ETZ) in Tilburg. Furthermore, an international comparison was performed in a collaboration between the UMCU, the John Hunter Hospital (JHH), Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, and the Harborview Medical Center (HMC), Seattle, Washington, the United States of America...|$|R
