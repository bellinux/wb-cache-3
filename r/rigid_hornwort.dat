5|$|There {{are a few}} {{localised}} {{examples of}} the <b>Rigid</b> <b>Hornwort</b> (Ceratophyllum demersum).|$|E
5000|$|Ceratophyllum demersum L. (<b>rigid</b> <b>hornwort</b> or common hornwort) - {{cosmopolitan}} ...|$|E
50|$|During the 1990s, aquatic plants, mostly <b>rigid</b> <b>hornwort,</b> {{have spread}} and now covers the lake bed. Along the shores are dense stands of common reed, lesser bulrush, common bulrush, and {{unbranched}} bur-reed.|$|E
5000|$|Make {{magazine}} Volume 10 contained {{instructions for}} creating a self-contained fresh-water [...] "biosphere", which contained a freshwater amano shrimp, snails, amphipods, ostracods, copepods, <b>rigid</b> <b>hornwort,</b> duckweed, pond scum (for microorganisms), and small rocks or shells (as a pH buffer).|$|E
50|$|Most common {{phytoplankton}} {{species are}} filamentous cyanobacteria and diatoms, while zooplankton {{are represented by}} daphnia and copepods. Common aquatic plants {{in the water column}} include <b>rigid</b> <b>hornwort</b> and yellow water-lily coupled with a presence of Nuttall's waterweed, frogbit, common duckweed, white waterlily, amphibious bistort, and four species of pondweeds.|$|E
50|$|Ceratophyllum demersum, {{commonly}} known as hornwort, <b>rigid</b> <b>hornwort,</b> coontail, or coon's tail, is a species of Ceratophyllum. It is a submerged, free-floating aquatic plant, with a cosmopolitan distribution, native to all continents except Antarctica. It is a harmful introduced weed in New Zealand. It is also a popular aquarium plant.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, a {{wide range}} of aquatic plants were {{documented}} in the lake: reed, common club-rush, common bulrush, lesser bulrush, yellow iris, alisma, branched bur-reed, water hemlock, marsh calla, water-soldier, yellow water-lily, white water-lily, broad-leaved pondweed, blunt-leaved pondweed, whorled water-milfoil, <b>rigid</b> <b>hornwort,</b> common bladderwort, pondweed, bog-bean, frogbit, lesser duckweed, greater duckweed, and ivy-leaved duckweed.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} aquatic plants is {{relatively}} small, with the lake floor dominated by <b>rigid</b> <b>hornwort,</b> and free-floating plants including Lemna minor, yellow water-lily, white waterlily, broad-leaved pondweed, and amphibious bistort. Along the shores are Alisma, slender tufted-sedge, cyperus-like sedge, reed sweet-grass, yellow iris, purple loosestrife, Phragmites, Rorippa amphibia, and many others. Common trees found {{around the lake}} include black alder and grey sallow.|$|E
50|$|The {{aquatic flora}} {{composed}} of reed, common club-rush, flowering rush, yellow iris, greater water-parsnip, brooklime, bulbous rush, toad rush, eight-stamened waterwort, needle spike-rush, spring quillwort, amphibious bistort, pale persicaria, <b>rigid</b> <b>hornwort,</b> horned pondweed, perfoliate pondweed, blunt-leaved pondweed, grass-wrack pondweed, fennel pondweed, various-leaved pondweed, lesser pondweed, fan-leaved water-goosefoot, whorled water-milfoil, alternate water-milfoil, spiked water-milfoil, Canadian waterweed, Nuttall's waterweed, and common duckweed. There are stoneworts such as Chara delicatula and Nitella flexilis.|$|E
50|$|Presence of {{phytoplankton}} {{is low in}} August with exceptional blue green algae, green algae, {{and golden}} algae. Occurrence of zooplankton is more varied with several species of rotifers, cladocerans, and copepods. Among the aquatic plants in the lake fennel pondweed is notable as it normally only occurs in sea bays. Other aquatic plants and nymphoides include <b>rigid</b> <b>hornwort,</b> broad-leaved pondweed, perfoliate pondweed, water-starwort, Nymphaea alba, Lemna, and Chara tomentosa (for which the lake is, together with Kyrksj√∂n, the only locale in Stockholm).|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1980s, {{isolated}} {{occurrences of}} <b>rigid</b> <b>hornwort</b> had {{established in the}} lake, and, by the mid-1990s, abundant quantities of other aquatic plants such as ivy duckweed and the liverwort Riccia fluitans, were reported along open edges of the lake. During that decade, submarine vegetation covered the entire lake bed which greatly cleared up the lake. In the mid-1980s, the only fauna reported was sparse occurrences of larvae and non-biting midges. Within ten years, however, the fauna had evolved considerably, {{probably due to the}} rich vegetation, to include Oligochaeta, gasteropods, and dragonfly larvae and today also the dragonfly species Aeshna osiliensis, common winter damselfly, and several others.|$|E
5000|$|The {{park has}} tennis courts and bowling greens, a conservatory, a bandstand (where music events are {{occasionally}} held) a children's playground and {{a garden of}} remembrance. Arthur Mee described it as [...] "one of the most charming and varied in all the London area". The park {{has a variety of}} wildlife habitats, including the lakes, some small woods and magnificent oak trees. Aquatic plants include <b>rigid</b> <b>hornwort,</b> which is rare in London. There are also breeding birds such as Canada geese, mallard, tufted duck, coot and moorhen.There used to be a running track at the North East of the park. [...] There is a community run cafe staffed by volunteers.|$|E
50|$|Bogbean and Water Lobelia {{are common}} plants of moorland pools and lochans. The Least (Nuphar pumila), Yellow and White Water-lilies are also widespread. Pipewort has {{generated}} some botanical controversy regarding its discovery, classification and distribution. It was found growing on Skye in the 18th century, {{although there was}} subsequent confusion as to both the discoverer and the correct scientific name - now agreed to be Eriocaulon aquaticum. The European range of this plant is confined to Scotland and western Ireland {{and it is one}} of {{only a small number of}} species which is common in North America, but very restricted in Europe.There are a few localised examples of the <b>Rigid</b> <b>Hornwort</b> (Ceratophyllum demersum).|$|E
5000|$|The {{shores of}} the lake contain {{individual}} willow trees and riparian forests, mostly composed of various species of Populus. Plants include common reed (Phragmites australis), lesser Indian reed mace (Typha angustata [...] ) and several species of cane - Schoenoplectus littoralis, S. lacustris and endemic S. kasachstanicus. Under water grow two types of Myriophyllum - spiked (M. spicatum) and whorled (M. verticillatum); several kinds of Potamogeton - shining (P. lucens), perfoliate (P. perfoliatus), kinky (P. crispus), fennel (P. pectinatus) and P. macrocarpus; as well as common bladderwort (Utricularia vulgaris), <b>rigid</b> <b>hornwort</b> (Ceratophyllum demersum) and two species of Najas. Phytoplankton, the concentration of which was 1.127 g/L in 1985, is represented by numerous species of algae.|$|E
