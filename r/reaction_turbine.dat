Nevertheless, the wheels have an element in common since their arms are very similar in so far as it refers to shape, position, and function. On the other hand, it is not a Scotch turbine either, being this a modification of the Baker turbine. Apparently, the Buena Vista turbine builder used the Scotch turbine principles to make the one in situ, adapting at the same time parts of the Baker's design with added improvements of its own. It is significant that in the mid-1840s—while the hacienda was being developed—the Scotch turbine was being patented in the United States after European designs (particularly the La Cour's centrifugal wheel).

5000|$|<b>Reaction</b> <b>turbines</b> develop torque by {{reacting}} to the gas or fluid's pressure or mass. The pressure of the gas or fluid changes as it passes through the turbine rotor blades. A pressure casement is needed to contain the working fluid as it acts on the turbine stage(s) or the turbine must be fully immersed in the fluid flow (such as with wind turbines). The casing contains and directs the working fluid and, for water turbines, maintains the suction imparted by the draft tube. Francis turbines and most steam turbines use this concept. For compressible working fluids, multiple turbine stages are usually used to harness the expanding gas efficiently. Newton's third law describes the transfer of energy for <b>reaction</b> <b>turbines.</b> <b>Reaction</b> <b>turbines</b> are better suited to higher flow velocities or applications where the fluid head (upstream pressure) is low.|$|R

40|$|The <b>reaction</b> <b>turbines</b> have {{application}} in very wide range hydro power projects. The turbines {{are the most}} important components of any hydro power plant. Its cost varies 15 - 35 % of the total cost of hydropower project. Thus the cost effective design of the turbine is of utmost importance. It is very crucial to understand the flow behavior of the turbine under various operating conditions. The model testing of turbines give overall performance of turbines based on global parameters. This approach is very costly and time consuming. But the detailed analysis of the performance of turbine is important under off-design and overloading conditions. Now-a-days computational fluid dynamics compliments experimental and theoretical approach by providing an alternate cost effective means of simulating real flow as it is much cheaper than experimental testing. In the present paper, the numerical flow simulation in <b>reaction</b> <b>turbines</b> ie, the axial and mixed flow turbines has been carried out to study effect of operating conditions on the local and global parameters of turbine.

5000|$|In power <b>turbines</b> like <b>reaction</b> <b>turbines,</b> Kaplan turbines, or Francis turbines, a {{diffuser}} tube {{is installed}} at the exit of the runner, known as draft tube. [...] In an impulse turbine the available head is high {{and there is no}} significant effect on the efficiency if the turbine is placed a couple of meters above the tail race. But in the case of <b>reaction</b> <b>turbines,</b> if the net head is low and if the turbine is installed above the tail race, there can be appreciable loss in available pressure head. If the pressure at the exit of the turbine is lower than the pressure of fluid in the tail race, a back flow of liquid into the turbine can result in significant damage. By placing a diffusing pipe at the exit of the runner, the pressure head is increased by decreasing the exit velocity, and both the overall efficiency and the output of the turbine can be improved.|$|R

The spilt <b>reaction</b> water <b>turbine</b> has shown good potential {{to be used for}} low head micro hydro-electric installations. The main advantage of this turbine is its simplicity to manufacture and reasonable energy conversion efficiency of about 65 - 70 % (hydro to mechanical energy). Theoretical investigation has also shown a simple <b>reaction</b> water <b>turbine</b> would perform better when it spins faster. And for the simple <b>reaction</b> water <b>turbine</b> to spin faster under constant water head, its diameter should be smaller.

40|$|Liquefied gas <b>reaction</b> <b>turbines</b> {{are subject}} to the {{hydraulic}} affinity laws. Particularly for liquefied hydrocarbon gas-driven turbines, deviations from the affinity laws are encountered. In the case of <b>reaction</b> <b>turbines,</b> where the geometry is fixed, the affinity law relationships between flow, head, and rotational speed are relevant. Field experience confirms that the affinity law relationships are adequate, but that the predictions made also tend to deviate from real turbine performance. Part of the deviations seen may be attributed to the nonideal fluid; however, further examination is warranted. This paper presents an investigation into the affinity law relationships between head, flow, and rotational speed in conjunction with actual turbine performance. The three basic affinity law relationships are combined to form the most general performance equation. This equation subsequently incorporates both the affinity law relationships and the conservation of energy principal. Application of real turbine test data shows that this general performance equation presents a more accurate representation of turbine performance than the affinity law relationships alone...|$|R

50|$|Turbine {{selection}} {{is based on}} the available water head, and less so on the available flow rate. In general, impulse turbines are used for high head sites, and <b>reaction</b> <b>turbines</b> are used for low head sites. Kaplan turbines with adjustable blade pitch are well-adapted to wide ranges of flow or head conditions, since their peak efficiency can be achieved over a wide range of flow conditions.|$|R

The management of the small hydropower plants is an important factor, for achieving higher efficiency of hydro turbines with time.

Cavitation is a phenomenon which manifests itself in the pitting of the metallic surfaces of turbine parts because of the formation of cavities.

Based on literature survey various aspects related to cavitation in hydro turbines, different causes for the declined performance and efficiency of the hydro turbines and suitable remedial measures suggested by various investigators have been discussed.
