50|$|This is an {{upcoming}} approach of eliminating shockwave and increasing safety for the vehicles. The concept {{is based on}} the fact that the risk of accident on a roadway increases with speed differential between the upstream and downstream vehicles. The two types of crash risk which can be reduced from VSL implementation are the <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> and the lane-change crash. Different approaches have been implemented by researchers to build a suitable VSL algorithm.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the factors that influence the frequency and severity of <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> in work zones because <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> represent a significant proportion of crashes that occur in work zones. METHODS: Truncated count data models were developed to identify influencing factors on the frequency of <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> in work zones and ordered probit models were developed to evaluate influencing factors on the severity of <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> in work zones. RESULTS: Most of the variables identified in this study for these 2 models were significant at the 95 percent level. The statistics for models indicate that the 2 developed models are appropriate compared to alternative models. CONCLUSIONS: Major findings related to the frequency of <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> include the following: (1) work zones for capacity and pavement improvements have the highest frequency compared to other types of work zones; (2) work zones controlled by flaggers are associated with more <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> compared to those controlled by arrow boards; and (3) work zones with alternating one-way traffic tended to have more <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> compared to those with lane shifts. Major findings related to the severity of the <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> include the following: (1) <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> associated with alcohol, night, pedestrians, and roadway defects are more severe, and those associated with careless backing, stalled vehicles, slippery roadways, and misunderstanding flagging signals are less severe; (2) truck involvement and a large number of vehicles in a crash are both associated with increased severity, and (3) <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> that happened in work zones for bridge, capacity, and pavement are likely to be more severe than others...|$|R
30|$|In {{places with}} lower speed limits, elapsed time to brake and stop is short, since the vehicle’s speed is low. Therefore, it is {{rational}} that {{the probability of}} <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> decreases in this situation. The positive sign of interstate highway variable demonstrates that the probability of <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> increases there, which is because of higher driving speed.|$|R
40|$|Low-speed Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) is {{a safety}} system {{designed}} to support passenger car drivers to avoid or mitigate the consequences of <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes,</b> mostly in urban road environments. This study set out {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of this technology in reducing real-life crashes, based on Swedish police-reported injury crashes 2010 - 2014. Cars with standard AEB were compared with non-AEB cars from the same manufacturer as well as from others. Both groups were chosen to be of similar types and weights. The statistical analysis used odds ratio calculations with an induced-exposure approach. In this case, striking <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> were considered sensitive to AEB. The non-sensitive crash types used in the analysis were struck <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> as well as all crossing crashes. Only two-car collisions were included. The results showed that the reduction of striking <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> in 50 km/h speed areas ranged between 54 % and 57 %. The reduction of all striking <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes,</b> regardless of speed area, ranged between 35 % and 41 %. These findings were in line with previous research, although of greater magnitude as the striking and the struck car could be identified and separated. However, it should be noted that the present study calculated the overall benefits of AEB, in terms of both crash avoidance and injury mitigation...|$|R
5000|$|The “Swoop and Squat” [...] scheme {{involves}} two cars: one drives {{beside the}} victim, {{while the other}} ‘swoops’ {{in front of the}} victim car and stops suddenly, causing a <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash.</b> The first car is usually full of accomplices who will claim that they were injured even if it was only a low-speed crash, submitting fraudulent claims to the insurance company. The swoop car is usually driven by an experienced ring member, while the “squat” car is generally full of either accomplices, or victims. In the 1990s poor Hispanic immigrants were recruited to drive the swoop cars: a high-risk job that nobody wanted, but for which the immigrants could be paid only $100. One such driver, Jose Luis Lopez Perez, died after a swoop and squat crash, leading to an investigation which revealed massive amounts of this fraud.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} drivers' merging {{behavior}} and the <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> risk in work zone merging areas during the entire merging implementation period {{from the time of}} starting a merging maneuver to that of completing the maneuver. With the merging traffic data from a work zone site in Singapore, a mixed probit model is developed to describe the merging behavior, and two surrogate safety measures including the time to collision (TTC) and deceleration rate to avoid the crash (DRAC) are adopted to compute the <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> risk between the merging vehicle and its neighboring vehicles. Results show that the merging vehicle has a bigger probability of completing a merging maneuver quickly under one of the following situations: (i) the merging vehicle moves relatively fast; (ii) the merging lead vehicle is a heavy vehicle; and (iii) there is a sizable gap in the adjacent through lane. Results indicate that the <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> risk does not monotonically increase as the merging vehicle speed increases. The merging vehicle's <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> risk is also affected by the vehicle type. There is a biggest increment of <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> risk if the merging lead vehicle belongs to a heavy vehicle. Although the reduced remaining distance to work zone could urge the merging vehicle to complete a merging maneuver quickly, it might lead to an increased <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> risk. Interestingly, it is found that the <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> risk could be generally increased over the elapsed time after the merging maneuver being triggered. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|A {{microscopic}} {{model of}} freeway <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> risk is developed {{based on a}} modified negative binomial regression and estimated using Washington State data. Compared with most existing models, this model has two major advantages: 1) it directly considers a driver’s response time distribution; and 2) it applies a new dual-impact structure accounting for the probability of both, a vehicle becoming an obstacle (oP) and the following vehicle’s reaction failure (fP). The results show for example that truck percentage-mile-per-lane has a dual impact, it increases oP and decreases fP, yielding a net decrease in <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> probabilities. Urban area, curvature, off-ramp and merge, shoulder width, and merge section are factors found to increase <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> probabilities. Daily VMT per lane has a dual impact, it decreases oP and increases fP, yielding a net increase, indicating for example that focusing VMT related safety improvement efforts on reducing drivers ’ failure to avoid crashes, such as crash-avoidance systems, is of key importance. Understanding such dual impacts is important for selecting and evaluating safety improvement plans for freeways...|$|E
40|$|Rear-end {{collisions}} are {{the single}} most frequent type of crash on freeways. Their impact on freeway operation is also most noticeable because {{almost all of them}} occur during periods of medium to heavy demand. Preliminary explorations of average traffic speeds before a crash measured at loop detector stations surrounding the crash location showed that <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> can be placed into two mutually exclusive groups: first, those that occur under extended congestion and, second, those that occur with relatively free-flow conditions prevailing 5 to 10 min before the crash. With loop detector data preceding these two groups of <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> contrasted with randomly selected noncrash data, {{it was found that the}} first group can be attributed to parameters such as the coefficient of variation in speed and average occupancy measurable through loop detectors at stations in the close vicinity of the crash location. For the second group, traffic parameters such as average speed and occupancy at stations downstream of the crash location were significant as were off-line factors such as the time of day and presence of an onramp in the downstream direction. It was also observed that traffic conditions belonging to the first segment occurred rarely on the freeway but still made up about half the <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes.</b> This observation, along with neural network-based classifiers, has been used to propose a strategy for real-time identification of conditions prone to the <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes.</b> The strategy can potentially identify almost 75 % of <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes,</b> with reasonable false alarms...|$|R
40|$|The general {{objective}} of the present analysis {{was to investigate the}} role of driver inattention in <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> and crossing path intersection crashes. To this end, a set of 133 naturalistic <b>crashes</b> (70 <b>rear-end</b> and 63 intersection crashes), obtained by means of the DriveCam on-board safety monitoring (OBSM) system, were analyzed based on a novel methodology for assigning and aggregating crash-contributing factors. The analysis focused on <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> where the OBSM-instrumented vehicle was striking a lead vehicle and crossing-path intersection crashes where the driver of the instrumented vehicle intended to proceed straight through the intersection. It was found that driver inattention, in particular driver distraction involving a diversion of gaze from the forward roadway, was the dominating factor contributing to the <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes.</b> Although driver inattention also contributed to the intersection crashes, the patterns of contributing factors for this crash type were quite different compared to the <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes.</b> In particular, in the intersection crashes, visual occlusion and insufficient selection of safety margins were identified as key contributing factors. Cognitively distracting activities that did not involve a diversion of gaze from the forward roadway, such as cell phone conversation, did not contribute frequently to avoidance failures for any of the crash types. The present results show that the role of driver inattention as a crash-contributing factor depends strongly on the type of crash. They also support previous findings from naturalistic driving studies that visual diversion from the forward roadway is the key mechanism by which inattention leads to <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes...</b>|$|R
40|$|Computing and {{information}} technology has significantly increased the capabilities to collect, store, and analyze freeway traffic surveillance data. The most common forms of such data are collected using the underground loop detectors. In the recent past the potential of using these data for identification of crash-prone conditions has been explored. In the present work, application of probabilistic neural networks (PNN) is explored to identify conditions prone to <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> on the freeway. PNN is a neural network implementation of the well-documented Bayesian classifier. In this research the <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> observed on the Interstate- 4 corridor in Orlando FL are {{divided into two groups}} based on the average traffic speeds observed around the crash location prior to the crash occurrence. Using decision tree-based classification it was observed that although these two groups of crashes have comparable frequencies, traffic conditions belonging to one of the groups (characterized by a low-speed traffic regime) are comparatively rare on the freeways. Hence, if those conditions are encountered on the freeway in real time, then conditions may be considered prone to <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes.</b> As conditions belonging to the other group of <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> (characterized by a medium-to-high speed regime) are more commonly observed on the freeway, PNN-based classification models are developed for this group. The <b>rear-end</b> <b>crashes</b> along with a sample of randomly selected noncrash cases were used to calibrate the classifiers. The output layer of the PNN models was modified to provide a measure of crash risk, instead of the binary classification based on an arbitrary threshold. A desirable threshold on this output may be established to separate crash-prone conditions from “normal” freeway traffic...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Rear-end crashes {{attribute}} {{to a large}} portion of total crashes in China, which lead to many casualties and property damage, especially when involving commercial vehicles. This paper aims to investigate the critical factors for occupant injury severity in the specific <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> type involving trucks as the front vehicle (FV). Methods: This paper investigated crashes occurred from 2011 to 2013 in Beijing area, China and selected 100 qualified cases i. e., rear-end crashes involving trucks as the FV. The crash data were supplemented with interviews from police officers and vehicle inspection. A binary logistic regression model was used to build the relationship between occupant injury severity and corresponding affecting factors. Moreover, a multinomial logistic model was used to predict the likelihood of fatal or severe injury or no injury in a <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash.</b> Results: The results provided insights on the characteristics of driver, vehicle and environment, and the corresponding influences on the likelihood of a <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash.</b> The binary logistic model showed that drivers' age, weight difference between vehicles, visibility condition and lane number of road significantly increased the likelihood for severe injury of <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash.</b> The multinomial logistic model and the average direct pseudo-elasticity of variables showed that night time, weekdays, drivers from other provinces and passenger vehicles as rear vehicles significantly increased the likelihood of rear drivers being fatal. Conclusion: All the abovementioned significant factors should be improved, such as the conditions of lighting and the layout of lanes on roads. Two of the most common driver factors are drivers' age and drivers' original residence. Young drivers and outsiders have a higher injury severity. Therefore it is imperative to enhance the safety education and management on the young drivers who steer heavy duty truck from other cities to Beijing on weekdays...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a driver performance map of braking and steering {{in response to}} three driving scenarios that lead to rear-end crashes. This map encompasses low risk, conflict, near-crash, and crash imminent driving states that correspond to advisory warning, crash imminent warning, and crash mitigation functionalities for intelligent vehicle <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> countermeasures. Specifically, this paper models driver response to a lead vehicle decelerating by building upon prior research that estimated the state boundaries for driver response to lead vehicle stopped or moving at slower constant speed. In addition, this paper compares braking performance to steering performance in the lead vehicle-decelerating scenario using plots of range and range-rate that roughly quantify the boundaries between the driving conflict states.

40|$|The {{involvement}} of a driver in a <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> {{and the manner}} in which his/her vehicle collides with other vehicle(s) depends not only on the driver’s perception of the complex scenario that emerges prior to the crash, but also on his/her precrash driving behavior, response to the imminent crash situation, and performance in resolving the driving conflicts. Obviously, any effort directed toward crash countermeasures must start from data collection in order to have a better understanding of these driver-related parameters in ‘naturalistic ’ settings. This would require deploying vehicles on the roadways that are equipped with certain devices to record data on such parameters. Due to the random nature of these crashes, the number of vehicles actually required to obtain the desired amount of information may be large, thereby making data collection an expensive proposition. A sample design is needed that can conserve resources and yet obtains the maximum information. The present study aims at proposing a sampling strategy for designing an optimal sample. It consists of stratifying the target population by driver’s age and allocating the sample over the strata on the basis of driver’s propensity of being in the striking/struck role in a <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash.</b> With a specific requirement of observing certain numbers of drivers in these two roles, the proposed strategy is compared with other methods of allocation, such as equal and proportional. The sample designed through this strategy is found to be much more economical in terms of the number of vehicles that need to be equipped and the number of voluntary drivers required. 1...|$|E

40|$|With {{the merit}} on {{representing}} traffic conflict through examining the crash mechanism and causality proactively, crash surrogate measures {{have long been}} proposed and applied to evaluate the traffic safety.

In this regard, {{it is important to}} know how the PRT affects the performances of surrogate indicators. To this end, three widely used surrogate measures are firstly modified by involv-ing the PRT into their crash mechanisms. Then, in order to examine the difference caused by the PRT, a comparative study is carried out on a freeway section of the Pacific Motorway, Australia.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{methodology}} {{to define and}} estimate a surrogate measure. By imposing a hypothetical disturbance to the leading vehicle, the following vehicle's action is represented as a probabilistic causal model. After that, a tree is built to describe the eight possible conflict types under the model. The surrogate measure, named Aggregated Crash Index (ACI), is thus proposed to measure the crash risk. This index reflects the accommodability of freeway traffic state to a traffic disturbance. We further apply this measure to evaluate the crash risks in a freeway section of Pacific Motorway, Australia.

40|$|Rear-end {{collisions}} predominantly {{occur in}} the daytime under clear, unobstructed viewing conditions and usually involve a lead vehicle that is stopped {{at the time of}} collision. These facts suggest that driver inattention plays a significant causal role in rear-end collisions, and mitigation efforts have therefore focused largely on development of warning technologies to alert drivers of an impending crash. However, we note that this pattern of crash data should not lead to the conclusion that drivers have special difficulty avoiding rear-end collisions in broad daylight. Nor should it be concluded that other “environmental” factors do not influence driving behavior to increase <b>rear-end</b> <b>crash</b> risk. Crash frequency is determined both by the inherent risk in the driving task and by the frequency of driver exposure to conditions in which a crash is possible. When exposure level is equated across conditions which differ in ambient light level, we find that rear-end collisions appear to be {{more than twice as likely}} in darkness than in daylight...|$|E
