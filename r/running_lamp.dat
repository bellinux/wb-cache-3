Ships were stopped in Mindelo for refueling, first 669 ships were refueled each year in 1879, later 1,927 ships stopped in Porto Grande in 1889 and was the highest ever reached. Telegraph activity soared after two submarine or telegraph cables linked with the island in 1874, they are now as communication cables or lines, via Madeira, it connected with Brazil {{in the capital of}} Pernambuco, Recife. India Rubber Gutta connected the line to the colonial capital along with West and Southern Africa and the United States in 1884 and in 1885, a line with Cameroon via Bathurst (now Banjul, Gambia, the line was the most used Transatlantic station in 1912 for some time. With it, the population grew from around 1,500 in 1870 to over 6,500 1890. Two lighthouses were built with the last one in 1894. Similar differences between Portugal and the United Kingdom for the Scramble for Africa and higher taxes put by the colonial government, its port could not compete with Las Palmas or nearby Dakar. During the 1890s, hunger and starvation with a famine started to appear and further more continued until the 1950s.As ships started to use the Suez Canal and gasoline fuel used for ships increased, the usage of coal dropped, the important port lost a great part of its strategic importance. and so did the island's economy in which hunger and poverty were rising. Into the time when ship services were dropping, people demanded to the Minister of Overseas to create a secondary a school and a foreign language school as it was shown in Revista de Cabo Verde (Cape Verde Review). Later Cape Verde's first cinema opened and was named Eden Park. In 1912, 4,000 coal workers went to strike and occupied the municipal hall at Praça da Republica over a drop in food products due to lack of rain and insufficient work at the port. Later in 1924, the people of Mindelo demanded a petition as the governor accepted a prohibition of alcohol including brandy on the island. After the Great Depression, ship stoppage at the port ceased for a few years, the last coal refueling was done in 1952. Around the 1960s, it had Cape Verde's most active economy, per capita, Sal's economy overcame the island's economy with its airport industry.In the 1880s, Mindelo had about a hundred oil <b>running</b> <b>lamp</b> posts.
