40|$|This {{paper is}} {{interested}} in a food industrial group which produces large quantities of sugar and distributes it to warehouses and customers. The group should review its distribution policy, in particular, to optimize transportation costs and reduce losses caused by the current organization. In this paper, we propose an integer linear model to optimize the travel of full loaded trucks taking into account respect of the groups peculiarities. We study a second integer linear model taking into account transportation and production costs and allowing the possibility of closing some plants. Finally, the last model aims to review the <b>production</b> capacity <b>of</b> each plant through a <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> its <b>production</b> lines...|$|R

The work begins with a theoretical study of a given topic, which contains a description of the basic goals and tasks <b>of</b> a <b>production</b> logistics, technology design principles, a description <b>of</b> <b>production</b> planning and control. In the last part of theoretical study {{deals with the}} application of various software tools to a logistics control an plannig. The second part focuses on the practical concerns of the thesis and includes a complete description and data collected from current production, evaluation and summary. In the third part of the bachelor’s thesis we deal with manufacturing errors, the <b>redeployment</b> and optimization <b>of</b> <b>production</b> processes. In the last part is the overall comparison of current layout and proposed production layout...|$|R

40|$|The <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> NK-cells in {{response}} to an acute bout of exercise is thought to be an integral component of the “fight-or-flight” response, preparing the body for potential injury or infection. We showed previously that CMV seropositivity impairs the <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> NK-cells with exercise in the young. In the current study, we examined the effect of aging on the <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> NK-cells with exercise in the context of CMV. We show here that CMV blunts the exercise-induced <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> NK-cells in both younger (23 – 39 [*]yrs) and older (50 – 64 [*]yrs) subjects with older CMVneg subjects showing the largest postexercise mobilization and 1 [*]h postexercise egress of NK-cells. The blunted exercise response in CMVpos individuals was associated with a decreased relative <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> the CD 158 a+ and CD 57 + NK-cell subsets in younger and older individuals. In addition, we show that aging is associated with a CMV-independent increase in the proportion of NK-cells expressing the terminal differentiation marker CD 57, while CMV is associated with an age-dependent decrease in the proportion of NK-cells expressing the inhibitory receptors KLRG 1 (in the younger group) and CD 158 a (in the older group). Collectively, these data suggest that CMV may decrease NK-cell mediated immunosurveillance after exercise in both younger and older individuals...|$|R

40|$|Offering {{business}} solutions {{instead of}} selling products {{has been identified}} by many firms as a strategy to fight against price pressure through commoditisation, to strengthen relationships with customers, and to increase ‘share of wallet’. Yet, {{three out of four}} companies selling business solutions fail to see a sustainable economic impact (Johansson et al., 2003). One approach to understanding how business solution suppliers could change this situation is to develop an understanding of the life cycle of business solutions, from idea generation to redeployment. This systematic review examines how the literature conceptualises the development, deployment and <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> business solutions. It systematically identifies and then analyses 31 scholarly articles contributing to our knowledge on this issue. The review discusses the literature within the framework of four aspects. Firstly, the review proposes the processes and phases of the development and deployment of business solutions. Secondly, it presents the components <b>of</b> the <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> business solutions. Thirdly, it provides information on the actors involved in the development, deployment, and <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> business solutions, and, fourthly, it discusses the interaction forms of these actors. The discussion shows that evidence in relation to the conceptualisation of the development, deployment, and <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> business solutions remains at a superficial, tentative and inconclusive level. The major limitations of the extant literature relate to the studies’ context-specificity, their lack of theoretical underpinning, and their deficiency of including actors of the supplier and/or customer network in the empirical investigation even though there is evidence that they {{play a role in the}} development, deployment, and <b>redeployment</b> <b>of</b> business solutions. Based on the limitations identified, the study suggests opportunities of further research...|$|R
