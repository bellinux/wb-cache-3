The new institution has its <b>registered</b> <b>matter</b> in art. 4881 - 4886 Criminal Procedure Code., Introduced by Law implementing the Code under Title IV – “Special Procedures” which recommends it from the beginning as a derogation from the common procedure. Nevertheless, given the position of remedy for excessive and unjustified extension of the criminal proceedings, as well as the judicial review, which it triggers in this regard, it raises the question of the legal nature of the appeal regarding the length of criminal proceedings. The answer to this question may affect the correct application of the institution and the improvement of judicial practice...|$|E

This area of research has only been of focus for a relatively few researchers. This in contrast to use and users of historical archives which has been in centre for more studies. The study is conducted with a quantitative method structuring data from 120 selected <b>registered</b> <b>matters</b> containing user queries. The research questions addressed are: - what user categories use the records of the authority - which are the ways of contacting the authority preferred by the users - which are the identifiers provided by the users and how well are they matched by the search artefacts available to the staff of the authority - what information and records are sought-after by the users. For comparing the identifiers provided to the search artefacts has been selected the two most frequently used registry systems within the authority. They are the registries for criminal matters and for traffic related matters. To analyse the findings are used a theoretical framework from the Records Continuum theory with special interest in the fourth dimension. Models of users and use of records and information are used both to structure the data collected and to analyse the findings. The used models are different in their ways of categorizing the users and their reasons for using records. This due to different the perspectives and research of the they are based on. The results of the study shows that the characteristics of users and use of records are dependent of the records held by the actual organization (here authority). In the researched organization users from other organizations are far more frequent than private users. The private users also contact the authority in many different ways preferring direct contact when other organizations are more likely to use fewer ways of contact and preferring non-direct ways of contact.

Hallidays third category, mode, is what he refers to as the symbolic organisation of the situation. Downes recognises two distinct aspects within the category of mode and suggests that not only does it describe the relation to the medium: written, spoken, and so on, but also describes the genre of the text (Downes. 1998, 316). Halliday refers to genre as pre-coded language, language that has not simply been used before, but that predetermines the selection of textual meanings.

40|$|The 22 q 11. 2 {{deletion}} syndrome (22 q 11 DS) is {{a widely}} recognized genetic model allowing the study of neuroanatomical biomarkers that underlie the risk for developing schizophrenia. Recent advances in magnetic resonance image analyses enable the examination of structural connectivity integrity, scarcely used in the 22 q 11 DS field. This framework potentially provides evidence for the disconnectivity hypothesis of schizophrenia in this high-risk population. In the present study, we quantify the whole brain white matter connections in 22 q 11 DS using deterministic tractography. Diffusion Tensor Imaging was acquired in 30 affected patients and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy participants. The Human Connectome technique was applied to <b>register</b> white <b>matter</b> streamlines with cortical anatomy. The number of fibers (streamlines) {{was used as a}} measure of connectivity for comparison between groups at the global, lobar and regional level. All statistics were corrected for age and gender. Results showed a 10 % reduction {{of the total number of}} fibers in patients compared to controls. After correcting for this global reduction, preserved connectivity was found within the right frontal and right parietal lobes. The relative increase in the number of fibers was located mainly in the right hemisphere. Conversely, an excessive reduction of connectivity was observed within and between limbic structures. Finally, a disproportionate reduction was shown at the level of fibers connecting the left fronto-temporal regions. We could therefore speculate that the observed disruption to fronto-temporal connectivity in individuals at risk of schizophrenia implies that fronto-tempora...|$|R

The approach utilizes all of the gray-scale data in both images, and the optimal mapping from image A to image B is the inverse of the optimal mapping from B to A.

40|$|According to the 1990 {{bulletin}} {{issued by}} the National Park Service, traditional cultural properties (TCPs) derive their significance from cultural practices or beliefs of living communities. This thesis centers on {{a case study of}} the nomination of Casita Rincón Criollo to the National Register of Historic Places as a TCP. The nomination is a collaborative project of Place Matters in New York City and Western Kentucky University, initiated by the American Folklore Society Working Group in Folklore and Historic Preservation Policy. Casita Rincón Criollo has several issues that make nomination to the National Register tricky. Casitas are small “houses,” typically accompanied by gardens, which serve as community gathering places for the Puerto Rican community in New York City. Often built illegally on empty lots, casitas tend to be impermanent structures. Casita Rincón Criollo in the South Bronx is less than 50 years old and has been moved and reconstructed. However, such is the nature of casitas. Building, maintaining, and rallying to save and move the casita makes the Casita Rincón Criollo significant. Further, Casita Rincon Criollo has served as a key influence on traditional forms of Puerto Rican music in the United States. For this reason, the Casita is recognized on City Lore’s grassroots <b>register,</b> Place <b>Matters,</b> and it was also incorporated into the GreenThumb garden movement in NYC. Folklorists are uniquely poised to recognize cultural groups and communities that might otherwise be overlooked by the National Register of Historic Places. In this thesis, I will discuss methods of research employed in the documentation of Casita Rincón Criollo and examine how folkloristic methods can address gaps in representation. I will contextualize the project within a broader history of heritage designation programs in the United States and world. From ethnographic fieldwork, oral histories, and more, I will conclude that folklorists offer alternative documentation strategies to supplement those most commonly employed in National Register nominations, as well as a more inclusive definition of cultural groups and tradition...|$|R

African dust outbreaks were identified over the period 2001 – 2008. Lidar measurements helped to assess thetemporal evolution of the dust layers and subsequent impact on the surface boundary layer. Monthly trends were analyzed, revealing a late spring/summer maximum occurrence of episodes. The most common synoptic meteorological situations causing the transport of the African dusty air masses were also identified o ver the seasons. Time series of particulate matter daily concentrations recorded across Air Quality Network monitoring stations and sampling campaigns were collected and analysed. Our results show the contribution of mineral dust to PM 10 (particulate matter lower than 10 μm, aerodynamic diameter) during African dust outbreaks to be significantly high at rural and urban sites of the Madrid Air Basin, giving rise to exceedances of the PM 10 daily limit value (50 μg/m 3). This result is especially relevant since European directive 2008 / 50 /EC on air quality, takes into account the potential exceedance of the PM 10 daily limit value, due to the transport of natural particles from arid regions.

A Hist?ria dos pequenos teatros na cidade de Manaus (1859 - 1900) aborda as express?es culturais da sociedade amazonense durante o per?odo provincial, enfocando os primeiros teatros da cidade: o Teatro feito de Palha descrito pelo viajante alem?o Robert Av?-Lallemant, o Teatro Variedade Comica, de Lima Penante, o Teatro Beneficente Portuguesa e o ?den Teatro, constru?dos antes do suntuoso Teatro Amazonas. Fundamentando-se nos preceitos da Nova Hist?ria Cultural, trata-se do estudo de um momento {{anterior}} ? grande produ??o da borracha, quando os espa?os da cidade e os costumes de seus moradores come?avam a se modificar e a se moldar ao gosto europeu. A pesquisa utilizou-se de fontes bibliogr?ficas e documentais, assim foram explorados al?m de textos que fundamentam teoricamente o trabalho, peri?dicos do s?culo XIX e in?cio do s?culo XX.

O objetivo foi colocar em pr?tica o exerc?cio da compara??o, atitude fundamental na an?lise hist?rica. Neste contexto, foi examinado os primeiros aspectos civilizat?rios que chegavam a Manaus, as vestimentas europeizadas e os modos contidos de se portar em p?blico, tudo a partir da ?nfase das manifesta??es teatrais, que procuravam entreter a popula??o, e ao mesmo tempo, educ?-la, no aspecto da moralidade baseada nos ideais burgueses, ou no comportado refinado e educado que se exigia em p?blico.

Isto indica dentre outras coisas, a exist?ncia de um poss?vel preconceito quanto ao tema: sendo a popula??o composta basicamente por ind?genas e seus descendentes, eles teriam lazeres que n?o poderiam ter relev?ncia para estudo: como se somente o lazer e os costumes europeus pudessem ser significativos. The dissertation called Sociability and Culture. The History of {{the small}} theaters {{in the city of}} Manaus (1859 - 1900) approaches the cultural expressions of the amazonian society during the provincial period, focusing on the first theaters of the city: the Straw Theater described by the German traveller Robert Ave-Lallemant, the Comic Variety Theater, from Lima Penante, the Portuguese Beneficient Theater and the Paradise Theater, all of them builded before the sumptuous Amazon Theater. Basing on the rules of the New Cultural History, it is concerning the study of a previous moment to the great production of the rubber, when the spaces {{of the city and the}} customs of its inhabitants started to modify and to mold to the European style. The research used bibliographical sources and <b>registers,</b> no <b>matter</b> they had been explored beyond some texts that theoretically base the periodic task, at the of the 19 th century and at the beginning of the 20 th century. We also appeal to other researches on the subject, that analyze the same time, even in other provinces. The objective was to put in practice the exercise of the comparison, that is a basic attitude in the historical analysis. In this context, the first aspects on civilization that arrived to Manaus were examined, the european clothes and the ways of behavior in public, everything from the emphasis of the theater manifestations, that traied to entertain the population, and at the same time, to educate it, in the aspect of the morality based on the bourgeois ideals, or the fine and educated held that was demanded in public. On the other hand, there were also studied the sociabilities and habits of the local inhabitants, like the balls, the religious parties, fishing, the baths in smalls rivers, and so on. One of the conclusions of this study is that even the subject demands inquiry continuity, there are few researches on the culture in that period.

It has not been clear whether statistical models of the relationship between heart rate and ventilation obtained using laboratory cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) can be applied to an external group to estimate ventilation. Objectives: To develop and evaluate a model to estimate respiratory ventilation based on heart rate for inhaled load of pollutant assessment in field studies. Methods: Sixty non-smoking men; 43 public street workers (public street group) and 17 employees of the Forest Institute (park group) performed a maximum cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). Regression equation models were constructed with the heart rate and natural logarithmic of minute ventilation data obtained on CPET. Ten individuals were chosen randomly (public street group) and were used for external validation of the models (test group). All subjects also underwent heart rate <b>register,</b> and particulate <b>matter</b> (PM 2. 5) monitoring for a 24 -hour period. Results: for the public street group, the median difference between estimated and observed data was 0. 5 (CI 95 % - 0. 2 to 1. 4) l/min and for the park group was 0. 2 (CI 95 % - 0. 2 to 1. 2) l/min. in the test group, estimated values were smaller than the ones observed in the CPET, with a median difference of - 2. 4 (CI 95 % - 4. 2 to - 1. 8) l/min. the mixed model estimated values suggest that this model is suitable for situations in which heart rate is around 120 - 140 bpm. Conclusion: the mixed effect model is suitable for ventilation estimate, with good accuracy when applied to homogeneous groups, suggesting that, in this case, the model could be used in field studies to estimate ventilation. A small but significant difference in the median of external validation estimates was observed, suggesting that the applicability of the model to external groups needs further evaluation.

40|$|API Changes, Bug Fixes, {{and a few}} New Features Improvements to the trait-creation API include {{support for}} an "entity" column when using CSV format, and {{ensuring}} trait treatments {{are consistent with the}} trait citation. The TraitsAndYieldsView resource is now available at /api/beta/search without error. Summary of Changes Bug Fixes Issue # 411 ("can't add sites to site-group") This has been fixed and an RSpec regression test has been added. Issue # 439 ("Can't update a site with NULL geometry") This has been fixed and an RSpec regression test has been added. Users must now explicitly set all three geometry coordinates (or leave them all blank). A bug in the formatting of the "From" header of API-related e-mail messages has been fixed. Certain problems having to do with Rails' treatment of PostgreSQL domains have been fixed. Improvements and New Features API-related changes As mentioned above, when using the trait-creation API, trait treatments must now be consistent with the citation associated with the trait. This also means that the name used for specifying a the treatment for a trait must only be unique within the set of treatments associated with the specified citation. As mentioned above, an entity column in now supported in CSV files submitted to the API's trait-creation pathway. Anonymous entities are no longer automatically created for each trait when an entity is not specified explicitly. (Per-trait anonymous entities add no useful information.) All <b>registered</b> users, no <b>matter</b> what their permission levels, are now allowed to change their own API key. API search results now include an "edit" URL with each item. When creating new traits via the API, fractional seconds are now allowed in the local_datetime field. Additional validity checks have been added for documents using local_datetime to ensure a site with a well-defined time zone has been unambiguously specified. Other changes The "notes" Rake task (this is mainly of interest to developers) : Running rake notes (or bundle exec rake notes) searches the code for notes and to-do items. This functionality has been extended so that more "special words" are recognized: namely "deprecation", "deprecated", and "note" (in various capitalization styles). And spec and script {{have been added to the}} list of directories searched. When running RSpec JavaScript-based tests in debug mode, the Chrome driver is now used instead of Firefox. (Version incompatibilities made using Firefox a pain to deal with.) The "Advanced Search" page (at [URL] now shows the "Include Unchecked Records" checkbox more prominently. Steps Needed for Upgrade Simply pull the new code and restart your server. No database migrations are required and no new Gems need be installed. (Additionally, if you want to use the Chrome driver for RSpec tests, you must download it and put it in your path.) Status of RSpec Tests All non-pending tests pass when run in the default environment. (There is one pending test having to do with site-group editing permissions.) The tests can be run using the command bundle exec rspec Complete details for running the rspec tests are at [URL]...|$|R
