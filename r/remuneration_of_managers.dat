Although this method of compensation supplies a very weak direct link between performance and the <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> <b>managers,</b> the authors show that competition among funds supplies a stronger indirect link. Empirical evidence is provided in the paper indicating that, owing to investor expectations of positive serial correlation in the performance of mutual funds, the indirect compensation offered by asset-based schemes provides a strong incentive to managers to maximize risk-adjusted fund returns. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} over corporate governance and banking regulation in Germany. Particular attention {{is put on}} legal and regulatory changes that were made {{in response to the}} financial market crisis. The paper shows that the changes mainly focus on the <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> and on further professionalizing the supervisory board. Problematic is that several laws that were enacted in the past years to improve corporate governance focus on listed firms. Furthermore, some of the recommendations and suggestions made to improve corporate governance in Germany are not legally binding even for stock corporations. Recent empirical evidence, moreover, suggests that bank shareholders pushed for greater risk-taking and not managers. This contrast with public view that the bank managers are pushed by aggressive remunerations schemes to increase risk-taking and indicates that the recent legal and regulatory changes fail to remove all weaknesses of the German corporate governance system.

40|$|Research that {{is being}} {{proposed}} refers to finding the ways to relate the <b>remunerations</b> <b>of</b> managements and supervisory boards to the results achieved by the company. Evaluation <b>of</b> the <b>managers</b> work is very complicated because of the ambivalence of benchmarks that {{are being used to}} calculate their salaries. This subject is highlighted especially at the time of economic downturn, when even the amounts that are paid to the managements are shocking for the observers. This article, however, focuses on the aspect of defining the proper reference, which would determinate the premium part of the management salaries. With the appropriate legislative regulations, <b>remunerations</b> <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> were well highlighted and so, that topic was exhibited to the wide debate. A major role was played here by the standards imposed by the Financial Supervision Commission and the Stock Exchange itself. Similarly, on the central level, legislation regulates this issue. From that point, a very important documents are EU directives from the year 2004 and so-called „chimney law”. Literature describing the issue <b>of</b> rewarding the <b>managers</b> is proposing to use many different benchmarks for the evaluation <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> work. The scope includes the simple ones, like net profits achieved by the company and more complicated like those based on the residual value. In the analysis that was made in the article, the simple measures were taken under consideration, because of their clarity and ease of interpretation by the managers and the investors. Performed calculations presents relations between the remunerations and the company results understood as the volume of sales and the net profit for the whole fiscal year. The carried survey proved that {{in the vast majority of}} cases, the proposed benchmarks are not a good reference for the interpretation <b>of</b> the <b>remuneration</b> determination process.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of the tax system on the {{economic}} factors that triggered the financial crisis. We examine three cases in which the tax regime interacted with these factors, reinforcing them. First, we focus on the taxation of residential building: while the importance of capital gains taxes is disputed, the deductibility of mortgage interest {{may have contributed to the}} financial crisis by creating some of the raw materials for the securitization industry. Second, a narrow perspective on the tax treatment, together with specific provisions, may have fostered performance-based <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> <b>managers,</b> resulting in overemphasis of short-term profitability and incentive to excessive risk-taking. Third, the securitization process, which played a key role in the outbreak of the financial crisis, was accompanied by opportunities for tax arbitrage and reduction of the overall tax wedge paid by investors, through offset of incomes that are ordinarily taxed at different rates; a de facto exemption of CDS premiums received by non-residents supplemented the tax arbitrage. taxation, financial crisis, housing market, stock options, securitization, credit default swaps...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the article}} is to study the {{distribution}} of income in Ukraine and indentify the level of inequality, {{as well as its}} causes. Official statistics do not give a real picture of the economic inequality in Ukraine. It was found out that the level of remuneration of labor is characterized by significant differentiation: the ratio of the minimum wage to the average wage was 0. 263 in 2015. The minimum level of <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> of state companies exceeded the minimum wage in 2016 by 250 times. The share of capital in the national income in 2014 - 2015 grew to 50 %, which indicates the distribution of income in favor of the capital owners and the deterioration of the position of employees. The excess of the return on capital (10 %) over the average rate of economic growth (4 %) will increase the inequality in the future. The reasons for the growing inequality in Ukraine is the orientation in international competition for capital on the model of “cheap labor”, unfair taxation of income from capital, corruption, shadow economy...|$|E
40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} {{the factors that}} determine managers' remuneration {{in a sample of}} 97 UK small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The sample was partitioned into two groups, one comprising of 69 managers working for firms located in the South East (SE) economic planning region and the other comprising 28 managers working for firms located in 'other English regions' (OR). The average <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> <b>managers</b> located in the SE {{in the latter half of}} 1988 was 30 000 Pounds whilst for those located in the OR their remuneration was significantly less and averaged only 17 500 Pounds for the same period. Several wage equations were then estimated to determine if this difference in remuneration was due primarily to differences in the managers' human capital and/or employing-firm characteristics or whether, after controlling for these factors, it was possible to detect a significant independent locational influence. The results indicate that both human capital (primarily the managers' age and qualifications) and firm/job-specific factors (their relative workloads, the size and growth of the firm in terms of assets) and the location of their employing firms were able to explain a large proportion of the variance in remuneration. Though the locational effect was statistically significant, after controlling for differences in human capital and job/firm-specific factors, the remuneration of the SE managers was estimated to be only some 3000 Pounds higher than that of managers located elsewhere in England...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between job satisfaction levels and the <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> non-owner <b>managers</b> employed by {{a sample of}} 97 UK small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) is investigated. The main empirical findings are that relative remuneration levels appear to be largely explained by differences in human capital and job/firm characteristics and that job satisfaction is positively related to deviations from these estimated comparison-income levels. Moreover, the equity theory expectation that individuals with the least prospect of redressing payment inequities will have the greatest incentives to respond to payment inequities by cognitive adjustment is also supported. The results indicate that job satisfaction levels for individuals expecting to remain in their current post are not significantly affected by current payment inequities. For those managers who expect to move firms, the amount of payment inequity has a significantly positive effect upon their job satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{so-called}} "Crisis Contracts" on bank managers' risk-taking incentives and on the probability of banking crises. Under a Crisis Contract, managers are required to contribute a pre-specified share of their past earnings to finance public rescue funds when a crisis occurs. This {{can be viewed as a}} retroactive tax that is levied only when a crisis occurs and that leads to a form of collective liability for bank managers. We develop a game-theoretic model of a banking sector whose shareholders have limited liability, so that society at large will suffer losses if a crisis occurs. Without Crisis Contracts, the managers' and shareholders' interests are aligned, and managers take more than the socially optimal level of risk. We investigate how the introduction of Crisis Contracts changes the equilibrium level of risk-taking and the <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> bank <b>managers.</b> We establish conditions under which the introduction of Crisis Contracts will reduce the probability of a banking crisis and improve social welfare. We explore how Crisis Contracts and capital requirements can supplement each other and we show that the efficacy of Crisis Contracts is not undermined by attempts to hedge...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{what might}} be done to limit the boom-bust cycle {{in the flow of}} capital to emerging markets. Although the paper accepts that some types of capital flow (notably foreign direct investment) are much less problematic in this respect than others (notably short-term bank loans), it argues that influencing the mix would have to be done by capital controls by capital-importing countries rather than supply-side policies. Where supply-side reforms might help is in making some types of flow less unstable: for example, the Buiter/Sibert proposal for a Universal Debt Rollover Option (which needs amendment to alter the term for which rollover might apply); allowing investors with fiduciary responsibilities to hold (though not to buy) bonds of sub-investment grade; penalizing put options in bond contracts and inserting collective action clauses; requiring foreign loans to be denominated in domestic currency; and modifying the <b>remuneration</b> practices <b>of</b> portfolio <b>managers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent to}} which the <b>remuneration</b> levels <b>of</b> non-owner <b>managers</b> employed by UK small and medium size enterprises (SME) can be explained empirically by a number of firm specific, human capital and job history characteristics. The UK SME sector is very heterogeneous and we test for possible differences in the determinants <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> for two distinct groups of firms. One group consists of high-growth firms that achieved an Unlisted Securities Market (USM) listing within 10 years of start-up. The second group consists of similar firms, matched with the USM firms in terms of age, sector and location, that have remained unquoted businesses. The empirical analysis, based upon data obtained from interviews with non-owner managers and the published financial records of their employing firms lodged at Companies House, focuses on comparing the separately estimated remuneration equations for the two groups <b>of</b> <b>managers.</b> The empirical results indicate that for both groups, the managers' age and qualifications and the asset size and location of their employing firms are significant factors and collectively are able to explain a large proportion of the cross-sectional variance in remuneration. Moreover, the size and significance levels of the estimated parameters on these variables were statistically identical in the two equations. However, the job history variables, in particular whether or not the manager had previously been employed by a large firm and whether the individual had previously been employed as a <b>manager,</b> were <b>of</b> relatively more importance in explaining the <b>remuneration</b> levels <b>of</b> the USM <b>managers.</b> Though there is a lack of previous empirical research on SME managerial pay, these results are broadly consistent with the expectations derived from the extant theoretical and empirical literatures...|$|R

40|$|Questions {{about the}} {{distribution}} of powers within corporations often make headlines in the media. During the downfall of Fortis extensive discussions have been held about the question whether {{the board of directors}} has authority to sell essential assets of the corporation and say on pay, shareholders clout on fixing <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> directors and <b>managers</b> caused a heated debate in many countries. The legislator can only react, but systematically offers ad hoc solutions. Legal doctrine and economic/empirical research often limit the scope of their recommendations to the authority for specific decisions. A general framework for {{the distribution of}} powers between the shareholders meeting and the board of directors is lacking. In my dissertation I attempt to stop this gap through a holistic approach of the distribution of decision-making authority between the shareholders meeting and the board of directors in Belgian stock corporations. The large diversity of decisions is analyzed against the backdrop of increasing complexity of decisions and stock ownership patterns. The purpose is to develop a framework for a corporate law policy which allows for efficient decision-making in all situations, relying on economic, (internal and external) comparative insights and existing empirical research. nrpages: 651 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Every {{year during}} the {{so-called}} “annual general meeting season” the <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> top <b>managers</b> makes it into the headlines of newspapers and onto the political agenda. Excessive executive remuneration is a long-standing problem, which has repeatedly caused regulatory action {{in the last two}} decades. The scholarly debate on executive remuneration is multifaceted and due to frequent reforms, quickly dated. This thesis focuses on remuneration governance, which is the system by which executive remuneration is set and monitored. In a critical comparison of the current German and UK remuneration governance rules it questions the effectiveness of the three main mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> governance – namely the (supervisory) board as the remuneration setter, the disclosure <b>of</b> executive <b>remuneration,</b> and the shareholder vote on executive remuneration. Taking the latest reforms into account, {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the two systems are identified. The thesis finds that the current remuneration governance instruments are not satisfactory. Suggestions for improvement are made, based in part on the experiences made in the other jurisdiction. An often neglected facet when examining remuneration governance is the influence of EU measures on national remuneration governance rules. The thesis finds generally a limited impact of EU measures in the past. For the future the question arises at which regulatory level measures for improvement should be taken. Further reforms regarding the (supervisory) board are – at least on a European level – not very promising. Rather the harmonisation of disclosure rules is suggested. Only EU measures could lead to standardisation sufficient to increase the disclosure’s informative value, clarity and comparability. In particular the form of the disclosure should be standardised. A standardised remuneration report would furthermore be predestined to be the subject-matter of an improved, harmonised shareholder vote. Enhanced transparency and comparability would empower shareholders and reduce agency costs. ...|$|R
