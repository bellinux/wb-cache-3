5|$|On Day 12—October 3, 2004—Sayid finds a {{peculiar}} cable <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean {{and into the}} jungle. While following it, he is caught in a trap. Sayid is suspended upside down, held by a rope, and recites the Shahadah. A mysterious French woman (Mira Furlan) cuts him down and ties him to a bed in a bunker. She asks where Alex is, but when Sayid {{says he does not}} know, she uses batteries and a cable to shock him. Sayid tells his torturer about the plane crash and the French transmission the survivors heard when they first crashed on the island. The torturer then identifies herself as Danielle Rousseau, the woman who sent out the transmission. Danielle finds a picture of a woman among Sayid's possessions, and Sayid identifies the subject as Nadia.|$|E

25|$|In Muni Metro terminology, an inbound {{train is}} one that heads from the western neighborhoods and West Portal towards Embarcadero, while an {{outbound}} train travels {{in the opposite direction}} out of downtown towards the west. Even the T Third Street Line is consistent with this terminology, with an inbound train going from West Portal through Embarcadero to Sunnydale, and an outbound train <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southeastern neighborhoods into downtown.|$|E
25|$|Walker {{went south}} across Church Street toward the {{adjacent}} Roman Catholic church in Sydney Road. Prison officer Bennett had his rifle aimed at Walker and ordered Walker to halt {{or he would}} shoot. Walker took cover behind a small wall that bordered the church. The prison alarm was raised by Warder Lange, and it began to blow loudly, indicating a prison escape. Unarmed warders, Wallis, Mitchinson and Paterson, came <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prison's main gate and onto the street.|$|E
25|$|Major Henry Smith, acting Commissioner of the City Police, {{claimed in}} his memoirs to have {{discovered}} bloodied water in a public sink in a court off Dorset Street, and as the water was slowly <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basin, he calculated that the Ripper had been there only moments before. Ripper author Martin Fido thought it unlikely that the culprit would wait to wash {{his hands in a}} semi-public place about forty minutes after the crime, and Smith's memoirs are both unreliable and embellished for dramatic effect. There is no mention of the sink in the official police reports.|$|E

500|$|The {{introduction}} of articulated connecting rods {{was regarded as}} a [...] "nuisance" [...] by Arthur Rubbra, a Rolls-Royce engine designer, as there were inherent problems with the arrangement. The complicated geometry meant that a pair of rods had different effective lengths, giving a longer stroke on the articulated side; consequently the cylinder liners on that side had to be lengthened to prevent the lower piston ring from <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylinder skirt. Articulated rods were used in the Goshawk engine, but were not embodied in the later Rolls-Royce Merlin, for which Arthur Rowledge had designed a revised blade and fork system.|$|E
500|$|Hill 303 {{forms an}} {{elongated}} oval [...] long on a northeast-southwest axis with an extreme elevation of [...] It {{is the first}} hill mass north of Waegwan and its southern slope {{comes down to the}} edge of the town. The hill grants observation of Waegwan, a network of roads <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town, the railroad and highway bridges across the river at that point, and long stretches of the river valley to the north and to the south. Its western slope terminates at the east bank of the Naktong River. From Waegwan a road runs north and south along the east bank of the Naktong, another northeast through the mountains toward Tabu-dong, and still another southeast toward Taegu. Hill 303 was a critical terrain feature in control of the main Pusan-Seoul railroad and highway crossing of the Naktong, as well as of Waegwan itself.|$|E
500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Early Winter" [...] {{was directed by}} Stefani's frequent collaborator Sophie Muller, who had previously directed the music videos of [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Wind It Up". Filming of the music video took place at destinations like Budapest, Milan, and Prague, where Stefani had been touring during The Sweet Escape Tour in October 2007. It opens with a black-and-white scene of Stefani {{lying on the ground}} in a long white gown. In the next scene, Stefani is shown walking on the street under red street lights and then holds her love interest, played by her tour backup dancer Steelo Vazquez, against the wall and talks to him. The scene then changes to Stefani walking on a street and later walking into the railway station. In the next scene, Stefani is seen singing under falling red-coloured feathers in a huge palace-type hall. Scenes of Stefani staring {{at herself in the mirror}} with her hair up and snow falling slowly down, with the lights turning on and off intermittently, are interspersed throughout the video. Stefani is also seen sitting on the ground and singing while crying. She is then shown at a railway station walking besides a moving train. The video ends with Stefani <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall. Tamar Anitai from MTV Buzzworthy praised the video for being [...] "acutely artful, immeasurably stylish" [...] and commented that [...] "Gwen’s managed to raise the bar on her own superlatively supreme style in her new video." ...|$|E

500|$|Harvey was {{regarded}} as a mercurial batsman of great artistry and style. A short man at 172cm (5ft;8in), he batted with aggression, and was known for his timing of the ball. His batting against spin bowling in particular was a crowd pleaser, highlighted by his extravagant footwork in charging the bowlers. Harvey often charged five paces down the pitch to spinners, with one bowler quipping [...] "He kept coming so far along the track toward me that I thought he must want to shake my hands". Despite <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crease so much, Harvey was never stumped in a Test match. He was of the time belief that any bowling could and should be hit, and gave the impression that the balls were reaching the boundary with a minimum of power. According to Johnnie Moyes, [...] "the sight of his slim figure, neat and trim-looking, always capless, coming to bat brought new hope for spectators. He will never prod a half volley or decline the challenge of a long hop...he will go looking for the ball which he can hit for four." [...] Following the retirement of Sir Donald Bradman, he was seen as Australia's leading batsman, noted by critics for a similar ability to change the mood of matches with his attacking play. Ashley Mallett said that Harvey is Australia's best batsman since Bradman. This was {{despite the fact that he}} was found to have faulty eyesight. With the global expansion of cricket, Harvey was the first Australian to make Test centuries in 15 different cities, succeeding in a variety of conditions. Harvey made 67 first-class centuries spread across 35 venues in six countries. He scored 38 of these overseas, where his average was higher. He was the first batsman to score more than 10,000 runs for Australian teams at home and abroad.|$|E
2500|$|In July 1933, {{the economy}} was {{beginning}} to revive after the Great Depression and the company promoted 18 firemen <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DeWitt yards to engineers. It was announced they would start as freight engineers and replace freight engine drivers who had been promoted to the passenger service. It also resulted in the hiring of 18 new firemen and additional brakemen and other trainmen were needed to [...] "man the new trains." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomson sailed {{on board}} the cable-laying ship [...] in August 1857, with Whitehouse {{confined}} to land owing to illness, but the voyage ended after [...] when the cable parted. Thomson contributed to the effort by publishing in the Engineer the whole theory of the stresses involved in the laying of a submarine cable, and showed that when the line is <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship, at a constant speed, in a uniform depth of water, it sinks in a slant or straight incline from {{the point where it}} enters the water to that where it touches the bottom.|$|E
50|$|The first ferry to {{regularly}} {{service the}} island was the Neuman Ferry, founded in 1907 by John Paul Neuman. The boat originally provided transport from Lakeside, Ohio to the island's East Harbor State Park. At their peak, the company contained a fleet <b>of</b> four boats: <b>the</b> Commuter, the Corsair, the Kelleys Islander, usually <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Marblehead and <b>the</b> Challenger <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Sandusky. <b>The</b> company folded in <b>the</b> first decade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 21st century due to financial mismanagement and excessive growth with low market share.|$|R

2500|$|Former Easterhouse guitarist Ivor Perry {{was brought}} in to replace Marr, and the band {{recorded}} some material with him which was never completed, including an early version of [...] "Bengali in Platforms", originally intended as the B-side of [...] "Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before". Perry was uncomfortable with the situation, stating [...] "it was like they wanted another Johnny Marr", and the sessions ended with (according to Perry) [...] "Morrissey <b>running</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> studio". By the time the group's fourth album Strangeways, Here We Come was released in September, the band had split up.|$|E
