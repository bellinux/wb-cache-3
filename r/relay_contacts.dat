50|$|Zero speed {{switches}} {{differ in}} terms of performance specifications, mounting styles, and features. Important specifications include operating range or the input shaft speed, trip set-point, operating temperature range, operating conditions, field adjustability, operating voltage, and <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> rating. For various applications, zero speed switch suppliers can provide zero speed switches that are explosion proof, weather proof or dust proof.|$|R
5000|$|Contact form, {{or simply}} form, {{is the term}} relay {{manufacturers}} use to describe a <b>relay's</b> <b>contact</b> configuration. [...] "Form A” refers to a single-pole, normally open switch. [...] "Form B" [...] indicates a single-throw, normally closed switch, and [...] "Form C" [...] indicates a single-pole, double-throw switch. Virtually any contact configuration can be described using this format.|$|R
5000|$|Tendency to fail [...] "shorted" [...] {{on their}} outputs, while {{electromechanical}} <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> tend to fail [...] "open".|$|E
50|$|They {{are used}} as high-current {{switches}} or contactors, where contact erosion from constant cycling {{would be a problem}} for conventional <b>relay</b> <b>contacts.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Another relay saw a metal washer {{slip off}} and jam the <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> up; the half-washers {{had to be}} {{replaced}} by full-circle washers.|$|E
5000|$|Electronic {{digital systems}} can measure and display the phase angle {{difference}} directly. The display {{may be a}} ring of discrete LEDs arranged to simulate {{the effect of a}} pointer moving over a scale, with a different color of LED to indicate the [...] "in phase" [...] condition. These instruments may also have a <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> for use by external control circuits, to indicate synchronism.|$|R
5000|$|The 407 was {{available}} in a model that could read 100 cards per minute, and one reading 150 cards per minute. The former had a relay which would inhibit every third card feed cycle (giving the machine a characteristic [...] "shrink-shrink-thunk" [...] sound). It was possible to insert a folded card between that <b>relay's</b> <b>contacts</b> to [...] "overclock" [...] the slower model to the faster speed.|$|R
50|$|When used {{as part of}} a {{security}} system, the electronics in the PIR typically control a small relay. This relay completes the circuit across a pair of electrical contacts connected to a detection input zone of the burglar alarm control panel. The system is usually designed such that if no motion is being detected, the <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> is closed—a 'normally closed' (NC) relay. If motion is detected, the relay opens, triggering the alarm.|$|R
50|$|Instead {{of running}} mains voltage to the switches, a low voltage—typically 24 V AC—is {{connected}} to remote momentary toggle or rocker switches. The momentary switches usually have SPDT contacts in an (ON)-OFF-(ON) configuration. Pushing the switch actuator {{in one direction}} causes the <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> to close; pushing it {{in the opposite direction}} causes the <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> to open. Any number of additional rocker switches can be wired in parallel, as needed in multiple locations. An optional master control can be added that turns all lights in the facility on or off simultaneously under the control of a timer or computer.|$|E
5000|$|The field {{inputs and}} outputs can either be {{continuously}} changing analog signals e.g. 4~ 20mA dc current loop or 2 state signals that switch either [...] "on" [...] or [...] "off", such as <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> or a semiconductor switch.|$|E
50|$|A {{mercury relay}} is a relay that uses mercury as the {{switching}} element. They are used where contact erosion {{would be a}} problem for conventional <b>relay</b> <b>contacts.</b> Owing to environmental considerations about significant amount of mercury used and modern alternatives, they are now comparatively uncommon.|$|E
50|$|A {{digital input}} {{indicates}} if a device {{is turned on}} or not - however it was detected. Some examples of an inherently digital input would be a 24 V DC/AC signal, current switch, an air flow switch, or a volta-free <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> (dry contact). Digital inputs could also be pulse type inputs counting the frequency of pulses over a given period of time. An example is a turbine flow meter transmitting rotation data as a frequency of pulses to an input.|$|R
50|$|Memory {{circuits}} in {{the form}} of latches can also be created by having a <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> complete the circuit of its own coil when operated. The relay will then latch and store the state to which it was driven. With this capability, relays were used to create special purpose computers for telephone switches in the 1930s. These designs were converted, starting in the 1950s, to wire spring relays, making them faster and more reliable. The majority of wire spring relays were used in 5XB switches.|$|R
50|$|The relay {{analyzes}} the resultant A/D converter outputs {{to determine if}} action is required under its protection algorithm(s). Protection algorithms are a set of logic equations in part designed by the protection engineer, and in part designed by the relay manufacturer.The relay is capable of applying advanced logic. It is capable of analyzing whether the relay should trip or restrain from tripping based on parameters set by the user, compared against many functions of its analogue inputs, <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> inputs, timing and order of event sequences.|$|R
5000|$|... 24 November 1989 - Three {{out of six}} {{cooling water}} pumps were {{switched}} off for a test. A fourth pump broke down {{and control of the}} reactor was lost; ten fuel elements were damaged and the reactor was close to melting down. The accident was reportedly attributed to sticky <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Consequently, for relays used {{to control}} {{inductive}} loads, we must specify the maximum current that may flow through the <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> when it actuates, the make rating; the continuous rating; and the break rating. The make rating may be several {{times larger than the}} continuous rating, which is itself larger than the break rating.|$|E
5000|$|An {{ion engine}} {{would give the}} {{spacecraft}} significant orbital flexibility for long-term support of future missions, opportunistic flybys of Phobos and Deimos, {{as well as the}} added capability of orbit support—rendezvous and capture—for a sample return mission. [...] An ion engine would also allow access to multiple latitudes and altitudes to optimize <b>relay</b> <b>contacts.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{design of}} {{switching}} circuit for the absorption method is significant. It is switching a high voltage arc, so the switch's contacts {{must have some}} form of arc suppression. Eaton had the telegraph key drive electromagnets that operated a relay. That relay used four sets of switch contacts in series for each of the two paths (one to the antenna and one to the back shunt). Each <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> was bridged by a resistor. Consequently, the switch was never completely open, but {{there was a lot of}} attenuation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{language}} {{itself can}} be seen as a set of connections between logical checkers (contacts) and actuators (coils). If a path can be traced between the left side of the rung and the output, through asserted (true or [...] "closed") contacts, the rung is true and the output coil storage bit is asserted (1) or true. If no path can be traced, then the output is false (0) and the [...] "coil" [...] by analogy to electromechanical relays is considered [...] "de-energized". The analogy between logical propositions and <b>relay</b> <b>contact</b> status is due to Claude Shannon.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Relays</b> and {{auxiliary}} <b>contact</b> blocks {{are rated}} according to IEC 60947-5-1.|$|R
5000|$|The {{processors}} receive {{information from}} input modules, process {{the information and}} decide control actions to be signalled by the output modules. The field inputs and outputs can be analog signals e.g. 4~ 20mA dc current loop or 2 state signals that switch either [...] "on" [...] or [...] "off", such as <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> or a semiconductor switch.|$|E
50|$|The {{benefits}} of the system are relative encoder simplicity (a simple motor-operated camwheel closing and opening <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> generates the pulse train) {{and the ability to}} use the same signal for track occupancy detection. The drawbacks are a somewhat long response time unsuitable for high speed operation (which resulted in ALS-EN's implementation), and the necessity to switch between 25/50/75 Hz frequency variants depending on traction current type (AC/DC) and other conditions.|$|E
50|$|A {{track circuit}} {{typically}} has power applied to each rail and a relay coil wired across them. When no train is present, {{the relay is energised}} {{by the current}} flowing from the power source through the rails. When a train is present, its axles short (shunt) the rails together; the current to the track relay coil drops, and it is de-energised. Circuits through the <b>relay</b> <b>contacts</b> therefore report whether or not the track is occupied.|$|E
5000|$|Oscar 3 was {{the first}} true amateur {{satellite}} <b>relaying</b> voice <b>contacts</b> in the VHF 2 meter band through a 1 W 50 kHz wide linear transponder (146 MHz uplink and 144 MHz downlink).|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic relays {{provide a}} well proven {{solution}} to switching loads {{in a variety}} of applications. However, relays are known for their limited reliability due to mechanical wear of internal switching elements, essentially the life of the relay may be determined by the life of the contacts. Failure to trip, spurious tripping and contact welding, can in critical applications such as control systems in avionics and signaling for rail networks, cause significant costs due to downtime as well as safety implications. Prognostics provides a way to assess the remaining useful life of an electromagnetic relay based on its current state of health. In this paper, the cause of failure and degradation for electromagnetic relays used in avionic power controllers are examined. A first principle model of an electromagnetic <b>relay,</b> including <b>contact</b> wear is proposed. The degradation observations and measurements form the basis for developing a model based remaining useful life prediction algorithm. Our overall aim is to derive a simple but accurate model of the <b>relays</b> <b>contact</b> degradation, and provide prediction of performance changes within the component...|$|R
