5000|$|Prior to Canadian Confederation, {{duty-free}} status {{had already}} been accorded by New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Canada to one another, each contingent on the other colonies' granting such status. There was also free trade between the colonies of British North America and the United States of America under the 1854 Reciprocity Treaty, but the United States had served notice in December 1864 that it wished to seek changes to the Treaty, including [...] "modifying the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> goods from Canada through the United States." [...] As goods from Canada were previously allowed {{to pass through the}} US in bond to ports in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia for transshipment to Britain, this represented a potentially significant non-tariff barrier that was on the minds of participants during the 18651867 intercolonial conferences that took place in Charlottetown, Quebec and London that {{led to the creation of}} the Dominion of Canada in 1867.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a presidential}} note {{published}} in The New York Times on 4 March 1920, Woodrow Wilson affirmed that [...] "he cannot approve any plan which assigns to Jugo-Slavia in the Northern district of Albania territorial compensation {{for what she}} is deprived of elsewhere," [...] thus forestalling the concession of Shkodër (Scutari) to Yugoslavia in exchange for Yugoslav recognition of Italian rights to Fiume.

The Yugoslav delegation, in a memo dated 14 January 1920, was in favour of an independent Albania free of foreign influence, but if that should not be feasible the delegates favoured territorial concessions to Yugoslavia in the north. The Allies were already content to recognise an Italian mandate over central Albania and Yugoslav <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> through northern Albania, with the attendant right to build and operate railroads on its territory.

The third United Nations Law of the Sea Conference (UNCLOS III) was convened in 1973 and terminated in the historic vote at New York on April 30, 1982 where 130 nations voted for the Law of the Sea Convention, only four voted against and seventeen abstained. The Law of the Sea Convention is a giant step forward in world and human affairs because it is concerned with sharing the earth's underwater resources amongst the earth's inhabitants rather than on the basis of first come/first served. The Convention controls, protects, shares and develops the oceans for all mankind. Questions of 12 mile limits, exclusive economic zones, continental shelves, territorial water <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> and innocent passage are also dealt with. Much old law is codified, much new law is created and even for non signatories there is much new customary international law.

5000|$|Lincoln was {{involved}} {{in at least two}} cases involving slavery. In an 1841 Illinois Supreme Court case, Bailey v. Cromwell, Lincoln successfully prevented the sale of a woman who was alleged to be a slave, making the argument that in Illinois [...] "the presumption of law was ... that every person was free, without regard to color." [...] In 1847 Abraham Lincoln defended Robert Matson, a slave owner who was trying to retrieve his runaway slaves. Matson brought slaves from his Kentucky plantation to work on land he owned in Illinois. The slaves were represented by Orlando Ficklin, Usher Linder, and Charles H. Constable. The slaves ran away because they believed that once they were in Illinois they were free, since the Northwest Ordinance forbade slavery in the territory that included Illinois. In this case, Lincoln invoked the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit,</b> which allowed slaveholders to take their slaves temporarily into free territory. Lincoln also stressed that Matson did not intend to have the slaves remain permanently in Illinois. Even with these arguments, judges in Coles County ruled against Lincoln and the slaves were set free. Donald notes, [...] "Neither the Matson case nor the Cromwell case should be taken as an indication of Lincoln's views on slavery; his business was law, not morality." [...] The <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>transit</b> was a legal theory recognized by some of the free states that a slaveowner could take slaves into a free state and retain ownership as long as the intent was not to permanently settle in the free state.|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} {{paper is}} a response to Axel Gosseries’s “Nations, Generations and Climate Justice. ” The core argument in Gosseries’s sharp and challenging text states that (1) we can understand intergenerational justice as transit duties between countries; that (2) impartial global planners should realize these duties through an intergenerational global leximin principle; and (3) that the <b>right</b> implementation <b>of</b> this principle implies strictly equivalent intergenerational transfers.
