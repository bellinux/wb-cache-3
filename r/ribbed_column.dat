40|$|Abstract: The {{feature of}} the {{concrete}} grid-frame structure with specially shaped columns is the frame beams and specially shaped columns in the walls were divided by rib beams and <b>rib</b> <b>columns,</b> then the <b>rib</b> beams, the <b>rib</b> <b>columns,</b> the frame beams and the specially shaped columns together constitute the grid-frame structures with specially shaped <b>columns.</b> The <b>rib</b> beams and the <b>rib</b> <b>columns</b> can share parts of the vertical and horizontal loads which the structure should bear and work together with the frame beams and the specially shaped columns, so make the lateral stiffness of the structure is increased and the ultimate strength, ductility and seismic performance of the structure are improved. Moreover, Phosphorus gypsum will be poured to enclose concrete beams and columns and become the filler wall among them. At the same time, phosphorus gypsum wallboards are used as the middle filler walls to separated rooms flexibly. By doing so, the building is more energy saving. In addition, the phosphorus gypsum which {{is a type of}} industrial waste can be consumed and become useful material in construction...|$|R

In the terrible crystal of his lens we have seen the bees not as a little yellow swarm, but rather in golden armies and hierarchies of warriors and queens. Imagination perpetually peers and creeps further down the avenues and vistas in the tubes of science, and one fancies every frantic reversal of proportions; the earwig striding across the echoing plain like an elephant, or the grasshopper coming roaring above our roofs like a vast aeroplane, as he leaps from Hertfordshire to Surrey. One seems to enter in a dream a temple of enormous entomology, whose architecture is based on something wilder than arms or backbones; in which the <b>ribbed</b> <b>columns</b> have the half-crawling look of dim and monstrous caterpillars; or the dome is a starry spider hung horribly in the void. There is one of the modern works of engineering that gives one something of this nameless fear of the exaggerations of an underworld; and that is the curious curved architecture of the under ground railway, commonly called the Twopenny Tube. Those squat archways, without any upright line or pillar, look {{as if they had been}} tunneled by huge worms who have never learned to lift their heads.

50|$|Macrogryphosaurus {{is based}} on MUCPv-321, a partial {{articulated}} postcranial skeleton. This specimen includes much of the vertebral <b>column,</b> <b>ribs,</b> complete pelvis, sternum, and four thoracic plates. These thin plates, situated alongside the ribcage, are like those of Talenkauen, another iguanodontian from the late Cretaceous of Argentina. Macrogryphosaurus was somewhat larger, though; MUCPv-321 is estimated at 6 m long, and this individual was probably not fully grown based {{on the lack of}} fusion in some vertebrae. It therefore {{is one of the largest}} known South American ornithopods outside of hadrosaurids. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that it is related to Talenkauen as a basal iguanodontian, and Calvo and colleagues proposed a new clade, Elasmaria, for the two genera. Like other basal iguanodontians, it would have been a bipedal herbivore.|$|R
50|$|The {{rib cage}} is an {{arrangement}} of bones in the thorax of all vertebrates except the lamprey and the frog. It is formed by the vertebral <b>column,</b> <b>ribs,</b> and sternum and encloses the heart and lungs. In humans, the rib cage, {{also known as the}} thoracic cage, is a bony and cartilaginous structure which surrounds the thoracic cavity and supports the pectoral girdle (shoulder girdle), forming a core portion of the human skeleton. A typical human rib cage consists of 24 ribs, the sternum (with xiphoid process), costal cartilages, and the 12 thoracic vertebrae. Together with the skin and associated fascia and muscles, the rib cage makes up the thoracic wall and provides attachments for the muscles of the neck, thorax, upper abdomen, and back.|$|R

50|$|Accompanying The AMP Tower is the six storey, {{low-rise}} L-shaped St James Building {{spanning the}} Southern and Western {{edges of the}} site. The shape of the St James Building encloses the site helping to create an early example of an L-shaped public plaza in Melbourne generated by the plot ratio bonus, with arcades surrounding the plaza at the ground level complimenting St James Plaza. Constructed of reinforced concrete, The St James Building has a façade also clad in the same polished re-constructed brown stone granite panels as The AMP Tower. The distinctive colonnades are formed from projecting piers, angled at 45 degrees from the main building, and extend {{all the way down}} to the enclosed plaza it faces. This creates deep sculptural recesses between them, and above are balconied window embrasures which add to the play of light across the façade of the St James Building. The muscular form of the façade and the broad protruding colonnades of The St James Building share the same minimalistic, brutalistic sculptural language and qualities of the <b>ribbing</b> and <b>columns</b> of The AMP Tower, while the abstract geometric patterns generated by the angled colonnades contrast against the straight vertical lines of The AMP Tower, creating an interesting combination of complimenting and juxtaposing structures whose features “dominate and give a dynamic life to the design”.|$|R
50|$|Brick Gothic in Poland is {{sometimes}} described {{as belonging to}} the Polish Gothic style. Though, {{the vast majority of}} Gothic buildings within the borders of modern Poland are brick-built, the term also encompasses non-brick Gothic structures, such as the Wawel Cathedral in Kraków, which is mostly stone-built. The principle characteristic of the Polish Gothic style is its limited use of stone work to complement the main brick construction. Stone was primarily utilized for window and door frames, arched <b>columns,</b> <b>ribbed</b> vaults, foundations and ornamentation, while brick remained the core building material used to erect walls and cap ceilings. This limited use of stone, as a supplementary building material, was most prevalent in Lesser Poland and was made possible by an abundance of limestone in the region—further north in the regions of Greater Poland, Mazovia and Pomerania the use of stone was virtually nonexistent.|$|R

MCZ 2987, a tip of the rostrum and some teeth collected 2.5 km from the type locality (from localities 11-13), was originally referred to C. wilmarthi by Lewis and Vaughn (1965). A redescription of sphenacodonts by Michel Laurin (1993 and 1994), revealed that it can't be assigned to any named sphenacodont genus. Although its teeth also bear cutting edges without serrations, they are more , not as strongly compressed laterally and not curved distally. A new genus wasn't erected for MCZ 2987, as it is very fragmentary and lacks sufficient diagnostic features.|$|R

[...] The head of the femur was large and lacked a fovea capitis femoris (a small depression in the head of the femur). [...] The femur was short and extremely robust, had a very high collodiaphyseal angle (the angle of the neck and shaft of the bone), and the greater trochanter was small. [...] In the adult, the humerus was significantly longer than the femur, while in the immature specimen, both the humerus and ulna were much longer than the femur, making the arms considerably longer than the legs, as also seen in Palaeopropithecus. [...] The relative length of the arms to the legs was shorter in Archaeoindris, so although its intermembral index was over 100, it was lower than that of Palaeopropithecus.|$|R
