5|$|Human {{activity}} {{is arguably the}} main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> population decline of the Puerto Rican amazon. Early settlers of Puerto Rico, such as the Taíno, hunted it for food consumption but managed to maintain a healthy ecological balance. Later, habitat destruction, capture of immature individuals for the pet industry, hunting and predation contributed to the sharp population decline. The clearing of mature forests for agricultural development is the main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> decline of population.|$|E

5|$|As is {{discussed}} below, the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> delay was probably simply {{that neither the}} Athenians nor the Persians were willing to risk battle initially.

There are two main theories to explain this.|$|E
