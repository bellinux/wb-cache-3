5000|$|The {{doctrine}} that such marriages were illicit {{was reflected in}} the Table of kindred and affinity in the Anglican (Church of England) Book of Common Prayer. [...] Prohibition of marriage between certain degrees of kindred outlawed what is known as incest; prohibition between degrees of <b>relationship</b> <b>by</b> marriage (<b>affinity)</b> as opposed to blood (consanguinity) seems to have reflected an analogous taboo. At least one novel, Felicia Skene's The Inheritance of Evil (1849), addressed the topic in polemic fictional form.|$|R

On the other hand, NADP-dependent DH had a much weaker affinity to immobilized 5 '-AMP than did NAD-dependent DH.
