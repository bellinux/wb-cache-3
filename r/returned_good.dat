By combining three established psychological phenomena - the need to belong, transference of attachment and aesthetic emotions - a novel research field addressing this was deducted and explored.

40|$|AimTo {{determine}} {{construct validity}} and reliability indicators of the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool {{in the context of}} randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). MethodsConfirmatory factor analysis was used to evaluate a unidimensional model consisting of 9 RoB categorical indicators evaluated across 94 RCTs addressing interventions for ASD. ResultsOnly five of the nine original RoB items <b>returned</b> <b>good</b> fit indices and so were retained in the analysis. Only one of this five had very high factor loadings. The remaining four indicators had more measurement error than common variance with the RoB latent factor. Together, the five indicators showed poor reliability (ω[*]=[*] 0. 687; 95 % CI: 0. 613 – 0. 761). ConclusionAlthough the Cochrane model of RoB for ASD exhibited good fit indices, the majorities of the items have more residual variance than common variance and, therefore, did not adequately capture the RoB in ASD intervention trials...|$|E

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder with serious implications in childhood. There is a significant gap in the identification and provision of health and social services for autism in Africa. The knowledge of autism among health care providers and identifying challenges associated with its management could facilitate bridging the gap and ensuring better outcomes. A self-administered tool, the Knowledge about Childhood Autism among Health Workers (KCAHW) questionnaire, was used in assessing knowledge of autism among 175 medical doctors (participants) attending an annual scientific meeting in northwest Nigeria.

40|$|Objective: Characterize and {{understand}} acoustic instrument {{performance on the}} surface of Titan. Methods: The Huygens probe measured the speed of sound in Titan's atmosphere with a 1 MHz pulse time-of-flight transducer pair {{near the bottom of the}} vehicle. We examine the fraction of pulses correctly received as af unction of time. Results: This system <b>returned</b> <b>good</b> data from about 11 km altitude, where the atmosphere became thick enough to effectively transmit the sound, down to the surface just before landing: these data have been analyzed previously. After an initial transient at landing, the instrument operated nominally for about 10 min, recording pulses much as during descent. The fraction of pulses detected then declined and the transmitted sound ceased to be detected altogether, despite no indication of instrument or probe configuration changes. Conclusions: The most likely explanation appears to be absorption of the signal by polyatomic gases with relaxation losses at the instrument frequency, such as ethane, acetylene and carbon dioxide. These vapors, detected independently by the GCMS instrument, were evolved from the surface material by the warmth leaking from the probe, and confirm the nature of the surface materials as ‘damp’ with a cocktail of volatile compounds.

In practice there is the important group of “collective customers”, who submit catalogs to acquaintances to collect their orders.

40|$|In August 2003, up to 14, 000 {{gallons of}} used oil spilled into Hunnicutt creek, {{headwaters}} to the Middle Oconee River. This resulted in significant aquatic ecological damage documented {{by members of}} the Upper Oconee Watershed Network (UOWN). The biological score for Hunnicutt Creek determined after the spill was poor ( 345 μg/L) and hexadecane (178. 66 mg/L). This was consistent with the poor biological score obtained in our September 2003 and January 2004 quarterly sampling at Ben Burton Park. The latter event yielded a poor biological score (12). The scores obtained in July 2004 were poor (7) closer to the contamination source but had <b>returned</b> <b>good</b> (20) at the creek’s mouth. A shallow depth (< 15 cm) chemical analysis of the sediments did not detect any organic contaminants of concern and monitoring results for 2004 show signs of improvement.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on bio-hydrogen production by co-digestion of sewerage sludge with food waste and its two derivatives, i. e. noodle waste and rice waste, was investigated by statistical modelling. Experimental {{results showed that}} increasing temperature from mesophilic (37 °C) to thermophilic (55 °C) was an effective mean for increasing bio-hydrogen production from food waste and noodle waste, but it caused {{a negative impact on}} bio-hydrogen production from rice waste. The maximum cumulative bio-hydrogen production of 650 mL was obtained from noodle waste under thermophilic temperature condition. Most of the production was observed during the first 48 h of incubation, which continued until 72 h of incubation. The decline in pH during this interval was 4. 3 and 4. 4 from a starting value of 7 under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, respectively. Most of the glucose consumption was also observed during 72 h of incubation and the maximum consumption was observed during the first 24 h, which was the same duration where the maximum pH drop occurred. The maximum hydrogen yields of 82. 47 mL VS − 1, 131. 38 mL COD − 1, and 44. 90 mL glucose − 1 were obtained from thermophilic food waste, thermophilic noodle waste and mesophilic rice waste, respectively. The production of volatile fatty acids increased with an increase in time and temperature in food waste and noodle waste reactors whereas they decreased with temperature in rice waste reactors. The statistical modelling <b>returned</b> <b>good</b> results with high values of coefficient of determination (R 2) for each waste type and 3 -D response surface plots developed by using models developed.
