5|$|However, the Sogdians epitomized the {{religious}} plurality found along the trade routes. The largest body of Sogdian texts are Buddhist, and Sogdians {{were among the}} principal translators of Buddhist sutras into Chinese. However, Buddhism did not take root in Sogdiana itself. Additionally, the Bulayiq monastery {{to the north of}} Turpan contained Sogdian Christian texts and there are numerous Manichaean texts in Sogdiana from nearby Qocho. The <b>reconversion</b> of Sogdians from Buddhism to Zoroastrianism coincided with the adoption of Zoroastrianism by the Sassanid Empire of Persia. From the 4th century onwards, Sogdian Buddhist pilgrims left behind evidence of their travels along the steep cliffs of the Indus River and Hunza Valley. It was here that they carved images of the Buddha and holy stupas in addition to their full names, in hopes that the Buddha would grant them his protection.|$|E

5|$|Christianity in Medieval Scotland {{includes}} {{all aspects of}} Christianity in the modern borders of Scotland in the Middle Ages. Christianity was probably introduced {{to what is now}} Lowland Scotland by Roman soldiers stationed in the north of the province of Britannia. After the collapse of Roman authority in the fifth century, Christianity is presumed to have survived among the British enclaves in the south of what is now Scotland, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced. Scotland was largely converted by Irish missions associated with figures such as St Columba, from the fifth to the seventh centuries. These missions founded monastic institutions and collegiate churches that served large areas. Scholars have identified a distinctive form of Celtic Christianity, in which abbots were more significant than bishops, attitudes to clerical celibacy were more relaxed and there were significant differences in practice with Roman Christianity, particularly the form of tonsure and the method of calculating Easter, although most of these issues had been resolved by the mid-seventh century. After the <b>reconversion</b> of Scandinavian Scotland in the tenth century, Christianity under papal authority was the dominant religion of the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several years the ship was either in reserve or used as a troop transport, until she began <b>reconversion</b> into a cruiser at Chatham Dockyard on 1 March 1923. The flight decks were removed and she was mostly {{restored}} to her designed configuration, although her 3-inch AA guns were replaced by three QF 4 inch Mk V AA guns. Two of these were mounted on a platform between the aft funnel and the mainmast and the third gun was positioned on the quarterdeck between the two 7.5-inch guns. The major exception was that No. 2 7.5-inch gun was not installed and she retained her hangar in the forward superstructure. The two derricks that serviced the hangar were replaced by a single crane on the starboard side of the hangar roof. No. 2's position was occupied by a prototype compressed-air Carey aircraft catapult, the first British cruiser to mount a catapult.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} a {{theoretical}} outline {{of the theory of}} <b>reconversions</b> {{in the light of the}} social space, with an analysis of top level athletes' mobility and strategies of <b>reconversions</b> in their trajectories through the relative autonomous field of sports. Some disciplines in this field have much autonomy, others less, and are positioned according to a state of distribution of the specific capital, accumulated in the consequence of previous struggles. Trajectories and classes are not reproduced in a mechanical way, there are specific effects in those. By the concept of strategies of <b>reconversions</b> it is possible to determine central societal processes according to transformations and reproductions of the social world. They are defined as practices by which social groups endeavour to keep 'on the road' or even change position. In that sense social life is about struggles and converting capital. The thesis builds upon investigations of sports. In an enquete, 1990, I examined whether cycling could be characterized as a field, and included 220 schemes. In 1993, I studied athletes' trajectories through sports, and how these athletes left sports, including 538 athletes distributed on 25 disciplines in the main analysis. Some of those were interviewed, and material about achievements in international championships and the Danish population were applied. I compared central tables with French sociologists in 1994 - 1996. I have used correspondence analysis according to a French interpretation. The important thing with this type of analysis is that modalities with small frequencies do not get lost, and there is a possibility of using supplementary modalities and individuals. The main thing is to analyse objective relational oppositions. Correspondence analysis is used together with sociological analysis, which is more sensitive towards empirical material and thereby closer to actually social processes. Two aspects in the transitions between the field of sports and the social space are important: the relative short period of time in sports and the objective possibilities after the time in sports. It is clear that the small conversion-rate of capital into a permanent job in sports (after the active period) is closely related to the fact that Denmark is a society with private organized institutions of sports and clubs grounded upon voluntary work, and no state institutions. This is contrary to the United States and France. Fifteen per cent obtain a job in the field, and it primarily concerns athletes from 'upper' and 'middle' classes (academics, teachers and directors) and agents with large volume of sports capital. What seems to be important is the structural homology between the social space and the way in which athletes find their pathways from the field to other places in the social space; capital can be converted on certain conditions. The great amount of movements regarding sons and daughters of self-employed to working class conditions and to positions like teachers reflect a general tendency in society. The correspondence analysis shows two main positions over time, dealing with agents who pass through and spend some time of the trajectory in the field of sports. On one side there is a vocational pole with origin among dominated classes, and on the other side an academic pole primarily with origin among dominating classes. Furthermore the analysis point at a dichotomy between objective opportunities for a professional career in badminton, golf, tennis etc. and no possibilities in curling, orienteering, shooting etc. There is an effect of gravitation/struggle from the field of sports, with the possibility of converting sports capital, but the strategies of <b>reconversions</b> and mobility depend also on the structural homology between the field and the social space mediated by trajectories, and the structure of society...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Proteins undergo {{thermally}} activated conformational fluctuations among {{two or more}} substates, but {{a quantitative}} inquiry on their kinetics is persistently challenged by numerous factors, including the complexity and dynamics of various interactions, along with the inability to detect functional substates within a resolvable time scale. Here, we analyzed in detail the current fluctuations of a monomeric β-barrel protein nanopore of known high-resolution X-ray crystal structure. We demonstrated that targeted perturbations of the protein nanopore system, {{in the form of}} loop-deletion mutagenesis, accompanying alterations of electrostatic interactions between long extracellular loops, produced modest changes of the differential activation free energies calculated at 25 °C, ΔΔG⧧, in the range near the thermal energy but substantial and correlated modifications of the differential activation enthalpies, ΔΔH⧧, and entropies, ΔΔS⧧. This finding indicates that the local conformational reorganizations of the packing and flexibility of the fluctuating loops lining the central constriction of this protein nanopore were supplemented by changes in the single-channel kinetics. These changes were reflected in the enthalpy−entropy <b>reconversions</b> of the interactions between the loop partners with a compensating temperature, TC, of ∼ 300 K, and an activatio...|$|R
40|$|Taxes {{have major}} costs beyond the {{collected}} revenue: deadweight from distorted incentives, {{compliance and enforcement}} costs, etc. A simple market mechanism, the Equity Tax, avoids these problems for the trickiest cases: corporate, dividend, and capital gains taxes. It exploits {{the ability of the}} share prices to reflect the expected true annual return (as perceived by investors, not as defined by law) and works only for publicly held corporations. Since going or staying public cannot be forced, and for some constitutional reasons too, the conversion to equity tax must be a voluntary contract. Repeated <b>reconversions</b> would be costly (all capital gains are realized) and thus rare. The converts and their shareholders pay no income, dividend, or capital gain taxes. Instead, they give the IRS, say, 2 % of stock per year to auction promptly. Debts are the lender’s assets: its status, not the debtor’s, determines their equity-tax or income-tax treatment. The system looks too simple to be right. However, it does have no loopholes (thus lowering the revenue-neutral tax rate), no compliance costs, requires little regulation, and leaves all business decisions tax neutral. The total capital the equity taxed sector absorbs is the only thing the tax could possibly distort. The rates should match so as to minimize this distortion. The equity tax enlarges the pre-tax profit since this is what the taxpayers maximize, not a different after-tax net. The wealth shelter is paid for by efficiency, not by lost tax. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{notion of}} « energy {{transition}} » has {{emerged during the}} past decade in order to point at processes or ambitions of decarbonising our energy path. Transition scenarios, quantitative visions and “technological potentials” have been produced in order to inform the steering of this transition. As witnessed by the raising number controversies about new energy technologies (NET), the overarching quantitative, economic and technological framing through which the energy transition is steered fails to point at a consensual transition path. The COLLENER poster aims at offering an occasion for confrontation and exchanges around social science analyses of critical dimensions of the ongoing energy transition. It stems from an eponymous interdisciplinary research project (economics, sociology, geography, urbanism, land planning) initiated in 2011, which allowed seven French research partners to follow, with the method of social sciences, ongoing processes of energy transitions on different scales (transnational, national, local), about different technologies (solar, wind, smart grids, biomass, low energy building, CCS) and in different countries (France, Germany, Tunisia). A key argument of the COLLENER project is that the only potentials are « transition potentials »: they are potentials-in-the-making, emerging through the processes of socio-spatio-technical assemblage of NET. The project gathers an impressive empirical material, following the socio–technical collectives at work in the making of transition processes. It totals up to 30 case studies from which we pulled transversal lines of analysis in order to address key dimensions of the energy transition, such as: -the socio-technical construction of energy resources, -the role of inherited socio-spatio-technical configurations and the temporality of the energy transition, -the territorial <b>reconversions</b> and the production of new spatialities,-the consequences of passing through market, technology/demonstration or economic instruments on the production and distribution of wealth and powers in and from the transition. In so doing, the project and the conference aim at contributing to a new perspective about the energy transition (process approach, dynamics, trans-scalar perspective) as well as about the notion and definition of transition potential...|$|R
40|$|Grasslands are an {{important}} element of European landscapes and environment. In the last decades, several causes have contributed to their decline, among which the intensification of agriculture activities. The National Park of Alta Murgia represents a typical agro-pastoral karst system where the conversion to arable lands caused a drastic decline of semi-natural rocky grasslands of high naturalistic value that traditionally were used for sheep grazing. This change of land use created much concern about the lack of biodiversity and soil degradation. Thus, the Park Authority promotes <b>reconversions</b> of arable lands into grasslands to safeguard biodiversity, increase pastoralism and enhance the multi-functionality of farms. This study evaluates the conservation and pastoral value of plant communities in former arable lands derived from grasslands conversion (by crushing the rocky substrate) and subsequently abandoned. We selected seven sites of these abandoned arable lands, no longer ploughed or sown for three to five or twelve to fifteen years. In order to have a comparison with situations of low anthropic pressures, other five sites were selected in nearby natural rocky grasslands, without evidence of soil disturbance. Further two sites were selected in lands manually cleared from stones and taken out of crop production for more than fifty years. Vegetation samples were carried out according to the standard phytosociological method. Shannon and Richness indexes, ecological and phytogeographical quality and pastoral value were calculated. The ecological quality was calculated through the ratio between cover of diagnostic taxa of the higher syntaxonomic units characterising the undisturbed pastures and total cover. The phytogeographical value was evaluated considering the cover of endemic, sub-endemic and rare taxa out of the total cover value of each plant sample. For the calculation of pastoral value we considered the palatability of taxa on a scale ranging from 0 to 5 according to data found in scientific literature. From a conservation perspective, sites originated from the conversion of rocky pastures by crushing of the rocky surface showed marked differences from undisturbed grasslands, even after 15 years from abandonment. Lands manually cleared and abandoned for more than fifty years did not show appreciable differences from semi-natural grasslands, conserving many taxa of high conservation value. On the other hand, fields originated from grasslands conversion showed higher pastoral value. This paper emphasises the need for safeguarding the rocky substrates and their remnant typical grassland communities, even in the so-called quote. Results are useful for the sustainable management of the agro-pastoral system of Alta Murgia, taking into account the ecological and economic role of those lands whose rocky substrate had been crushed...|$|R
40|$|In 1980, El Salvador {{fragmented}} revolutionary movement {{united to}} form the Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional (FMLN). This Front subsequently fought a war against the U. S. backed Salvadoran military which culminated in military stalemate. After the 1992 Peace Accords, the guerrilla army demobilized and the FMLN became a political party. Though the right-wing government party won the elections in subsequent years, the FMLN soon consolidated itself as the main opposition party. From 1997 on, it won several important municipalities. In 2009, the FMLN won the presidential elections and constituted the first left-wing government in the country’s history. This study presents a retrospective analysis of the postwar legacy of El Salvador’s insurgent movement. It demonstrates {{how and why the}} insurgent relations forged during the war continued to be highly relevant throughout the postwar period, and how these internal relations shaped the development of the former insurgents as a political electoral force. At war’s end, the former insurgents sought different ways of collective and individual accommodation to the emerging circumstances. Different insurgents leaders and subgroups held different cards that facilitated–or hindered–social, political and economic ascendency in the postwar context. Drawing on Bourdieu and others, this study looks at post-insurgency as a social field: a historically constructed space of relationships between multiple social agents that were previously connected through participation in insurgency. This perspective emphasizes the importance of the movement’s internal relations and of its modifications over time. The study of internal relations of a movement that operated clandestinely for large part of its existence is a delicate and complicated task. Hence, the study offers three detailed longitudinal case studies providing a window into parts of the movement, drawing on the disciplines of social history and political ethnography. The case studies treat postwar affairs in a peasant community founded by the insurgent movement, a review of the life trajectories of guerrilla fighters identified from historical photographs, and an inside account of the movement of FMLN veterans and their political activities, respectively. These case studies show how post-insurgent accommodations led to more pronounced internal inequalities, growing postwar disillusionment and the rise of patronage and clientelism in different segments of the movement. The contentious accommodation of internal relations {{played a key role in}} the postwar development of El Salvador’s former insurgent movement. This finding holds broader relevance for research on post-insurgent transitions. It posits the need to look beyond the strictly military and political aspects of insurgency and pay attention to the insurgents’ social history, including clandestine connections, in research on post-insurgent transitions. It challenges social scientists to consider the myriad ways in which insurgent networks may reconvert to adapt to the emerging circumstances of peace, and how such <b>reconversions</b> may impact on post-war societies. The interpersonal relations shaped in the insurgent movement might well constitute one of the most enduring legacies of insurgency in its aftermath. In the case of El Salvador, it has been a crucial part of what former insurgents worked with to gain postwar ascendency...|$|R
