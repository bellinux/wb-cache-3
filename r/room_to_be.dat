5|$|In {{the distant}} future, deadly solar flares force {{humanity}} to evacuate Earth on giant, nationalistic colony ships. The Doctor and Amy arrive on Starship UK, {{one of the}} last ships to leave and holding the population of the United Kingdom. Amy tends to a crying young girl ignored by adults while the Doctor, curious to the ship's engines, seeks the control room. He finds the <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a false front, and encounters Liz 10, who seems to know him.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after its}} {{foundation}} the LNC used existing firms of London undertakers to arrange funerals, {{but over time}} took over {{all aspects of the}} arrangements from coffin-making to masonry. LNC funerals were intentionally kept as similar as possible to those of traditional undertakers, with the exception that a railway carriage was used in place of a hearse. On being commissioned to provide a funeral, invitations would be sent out either by the deceased's family or from the LNC offices. These letters specified the waiting <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used, the time of the train to Brookwood, and the expected return time to London. If the funeral was to be held in London, a traditional hearse and carriage would take the deceased to their parish church for the service, and then on to the London railway terminus; if the funeral was to take place in the terminus or in Brookwood, the procession would come directly to the terminus.|$|E
5|$|In the White House, Clinton placed donated {{handicrafts}} {{of contemporary}} American artisans, such as pottery and glassware, on rotating {{display in the}} state rooms. She oversaw {{the restoration of the}} Blue <b>Room</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> historically authentic to the period of James Monroe and the Map Room to how it looked during World War II. Working with Arkansas interior decorator Kaki Hockersmith over an eight-year period, she oversaw extensive, privately funded redecoration efforts around the building, often trying to make it look brighter. These included changing the look of the Treaty Room, a presidential study, to along 19th century lines. Overall the redecoration brought mixed notices, with Victorian furnishings for the Lincoln Sitting Room being criticized the most. Clinton hosted many large-scale events at the White House, including a state dinner for visiting Chinese dignitaries, a New Year's Eve celebration {{at the turn of the}} 21st century and a state dinner honoring the bicentennial of the White House in November 2000.|$|E

5|$|Henri Christophe's {{widow and}} {{children}} are taken to Europe by English merchants, who used to supply the royal family. Solimán accompanies them and enjoys the summers in Rome, where he is treated well and tells embellished tales of his past. He encounters a statue of Pauline whose form brings back memories, and sends him into a howl, causing the <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rushed. He is reminded of the night of Henri Christophe's demise and flees before succumbing to malaria. Ti Noel recalls things told by Macandal, and the former plantation of Lenormand de Mezy has become a happy place, with Ti Noel presiding over celebrations and festivities. Surveyors disrupt the peace at the plantation, and mulattoes have risen to power; they force hundreds of black prisoners to work by whiplash, and many have lost hope as the cycle of slavery continues. Ti Noel, thinking of Macandal, decides to transform into various animals to observe the ongoing events; he metamorphoses into a bird, a stallion, a wasp, and then an ant. He eventually becomes a goose, but is rejected by the clan of geese. He understands that being a goose {{does not imply that}} all geese are equal, so he returns to human form. The book concludes with the end of Ti Noel's life, and his own self-reflection upon greatness and The Kingdom of This World.|$|E
25|$|The {{design of}} earlier optical {{periscopes}} {{required them to}} penetrate the pressure hull, reducing the structural integrity of the pressure hull as well as increasing the risk of flooding, and also required the submarine's control <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> located directly below the sail/fin. Implementation of photonics masts (which do not penetrate the pressure hull) enabled the submarine control <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relocated to a position inside the pressure hull which is not necessarily directly below the sail.|$|E

25|$|Medieval period peasants' cottages {{have rarely}} survived, while the prestigious {{dwellings}} of merchants and traders {{are still in}} evidence. The urban poor manufactured items in the living area of their cottages. The rural poor, bound to the land owner, worked {{in one of their}} master's buildings. With the rise of a non-agrarian society, subsistence level domestic manufacture became common, and the introduction of machinery required either the living <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> enlarged and modified or the addition of a separate room. Requirements were similar for any domestic manufacturing craft industry.|$|E
25|$|Roman hypocaust {{heating systems}} made {{extensive}} use of fired clay elements: The space beneath {{the floor of a}} <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heated was supported on robust pillars (pilae), usually made of small, square bricks mortared together, so that the heat from the adjacent furnace could circulate freely. In public and private bath-houses (essential to the Roman way of life), heat was also carried up through the walls in flues made of interlocking box-tiles. Though these were covered up by wall facings both inside and out, they were sometimes manufactured with quite elaborate geometric and even figural decoration. Pipes for water and drainage were also often made of fired clay.|$|E
25|$|The {{dining hall}} {{refurbishment}} {{was completed by}} September 2010, whilst the remaining work was completed around Easter 2012. The new catering facilities were unveiled during a ceremony on 14 March 2012. During the ceremony, college members gathered in a restored 15th century building {{in the heart of}} college, originally the college kitchens and most recently used as the servery. This <b>room,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> known as the Mediaeval Kitchen, will be used as a new dining space in addition to the main dining hall, which will remain the usual location for student meals. The temporary kitchen and builder's yard were removed and the Quads restored to their normal state during the Easter 2012 vacation.|$|E

25|$|It {{was known}} that the filter room could be {{overwhelmed}} by a high volume of reports, {{and it was a}} constant complaint that it was a single point of failure in reports from OR and in the RAF and Air Ministry. Most critics wanted the filter <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moved from Bentley Priory to Group commands, lowering the reporting volume at each location and providing duplication. Dowding refused the change, leading to increasing friction with other commanders. Information overload occurred on several occasions and the filter room had to ask certain CH stations to stop reporting. But this had little effect on their capabilities. Later, stations reported information for multiple formations as a single plot.|$|E
25|$|Filming {{commenced}} Monday, March 28, 1994. Production on Generations began while The Next Generation {{was still}} filming, so scenes {{that did not}} feature The Next Generation regulars were filmed first. After {{the end of the}} show, there was only six months before the film was scheduled to be released in theaters. The first scenes filmed were those in the Enterprise-B deflector room; the beginning of filming was concurrent with The Next Generations production, and the film and show were filmed simultaneously on different soundstages on Paramount Studio's lot. Scenes of Harriman, Chekov, and Scott reacting to Kirk's apparent death were filmed a week later, to allow time for the deflector <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> suitably distressed to visualize the damage.|$|E

25|$|The Kennedy {{renovation}} was {{overseen by}} American antiques autodidact Henry Francis du Pont and French interior designer Stéphane Boudin and his company, Maison Jansen. Kennedy also established an advisory Committee on Fine Arts {{made up of}} museum professionals as well as wealthy individuals interested in antiques. Kennedy was an ardent admirer of French interior design, and the Red Room {{was not only the}} first <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> redesigned during the Kennedy renovation but also the room refurbished almost completely in a French style. But because the involvement of a French interior decorator was considered politically unpalatable to the American people, Boudin's role in redecorating the Red Room was not mentioned and the refurbishment was for many years attributed solely to Parish.|$|E
25|$|In the present, Gareth has {{captured}} most of Rick's (Andrew Lincoln) {{group in a}} train car at Terminus. Rick encourages the group to fashion make-shift weapons as they relate their experiences that led to Terminus.

Moments later, Gareth has Rick, Daryl (Norman Reedus), Glenn (Steven Yeun), and Bob (Lawrence Gilliard Jr.) secured in a butchering <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bloodlet {{so that they can}} be fed to the Terminus people. Sam (Robin Lord Taylor) (a survivor previously found Rick) and three others are killed but Gareth arrives before Rick, next in line, is killed, asking about a gun bag that he had seen Rick carrying. Rick vows to kill Gareth with one of the weapons from it.|$|E
25|$|This branch was {{initially}} founded by Henry O. Tripp {{and members of}} the Arlington Baptist Church. It was established in the neighborhood district hall in 1895 with a collection of 500 volumes. In 1907, the Arlington Library moved to a new building on Cranston Street. It also added a branch in the Cranston Print Works Brick Store, which lasted for 50 years until the building was demolished. In an agreement with the city of Cranston, the Arlington Library building on Cranston Street was turned over to the city and demolished to build a new Cranston Senior Center in 1987. The agreement called for the Arlington Reading <b>Room</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> located inside the new center. In 2013, this Reading Room was renovated, with new collections and updated technology.
