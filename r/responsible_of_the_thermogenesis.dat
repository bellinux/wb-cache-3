40|$|Duodenal {{infusion}} of hypertonic solutions elicits osmolality-dependent thermogenesis in urethane-anaesthetized rats. Here we investigated <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> autonomic nervous system, adrenal medulla and brain in <b>the</b> mechanism <b>of</b> this <b>thermogenesis.</b> Bilateral subdiaphragmatic vagotomy greatly attenuated the first hour, but not <b>the</b> later phase, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thermogenesis</b> induced by 3. 6 % NaCl (10 ml kg− 1). Neither atropine pretreatment (10 mg kg− 1, i. p) nor capsaicin desensitization had {{any effect on}} <b>the</b> osmotically induced <b>thermogenesis,</b> suggesting <b>the</b> involvement <b>of</b> non-nociceptive vagal afferents. Bilateral splanchnic denervation caudal to the suprarenal ganglia also had no effect, suggesting a lack of involvement of spinal afferents and sympathetic efferents to the major upper abdominal organs. Adrenal demedullation greatly attenuated the initial phase, but not <b>the</b> later phase, <b>of</b> <b>thermogenesis.</b> Pretreatment with <b>the</b> β-blocker propranolol (20 mg kg− 1, i. p) attenuated <b>the</b> <b>thermogenesis</b> throughout <b>the</b> 3 h observation period. The plasma adrenaline concentration increased significantly 20 min after osmotic stimulation but returned to the basal level after 60 min. The plasma noradrenaline concentration increased 20 min after osmotic stimulation and remained significantly elevated for 120 min. Therefore, adrenaline largely mediated <b>the</b> initial phase <b>of</b> <b>thermogenesis,</b> and noradrenaline {{was involved in the}} entire thermogenic response. Moreover, neither decerebration nor pretreatment with the antipyretic indomethacin (10 mg kg− 1, s. c) had any effect. Accordingly, this thermogenesis did not require the forebrain and was different from that associated with fever. These results show <b>the</b> critical involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vagal afferents, hindbrain and sympathoadrenal system in <b>the</b> <b>thermogenesis</b> induced by osmotic stimulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intestines...|$|R
