25|$|The US and European {{refractories}} {{industry had}} {{a crisis in}} 2000–2003, with an indifferent market for steel and a declining <b>refractory</b> <b>consumption</b> per tonne of steel underlying firm buyouts and many plant closures. Many of the plant closures resulted from the acquisition of Harbison-Walker Refractories by RHI AG and some plants had their equipment auctioned off. Since much of the lost capacity was for carbon-magnesite brick, graphite consumption within the refractories area moved towards alumina-graphite shapes and monolithics, and away from brick. The major source of carbon-magnesite brick is now imports from China. Almost {{all of the above}} refractories are used to make steel and account for 75% of refractory consumption; the rest is used by a variety of industries, such as cement.|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{the demand}} for steels with low {{phosphorus}} content has been increasing. Due to this, {{it is necessary to}} improve the process to attain higher phosphorus partitions in steels produced in the BOF. The present paper shows the modifications carried out in the process variables such as: flux additions and oxygen lance position, in order to achieve the expected results. The basis for process modifications was established considering classical phosphorus partition models of Healy, Turkdogan, Balajiva. The results achieved during low phosphorus steels production before and after changing process variables are presented and discussed in this report. In addition, the impact of the new procedures on the <b>refractory</b> <b>consumption</b> is also analyzed...|$|E
40|$|In {{electric}} arc furnace steelmaking units, the essential parameters that considered important are reducing price, increasing production and decreasing environmental pollution. Electric arc furnaces are the largest users of electric energy in industry. The most important techniques {{that can be used}} to reduce the electric energy consumption in {{electric arc}} furnaces are scrap preheating, stirring, use of burners and hot charge and foamy slag. Between these methods, use of foamy slag is the most useful and economic factor. Foamy slag can reduce the amount of energy, electrods, <b>refractory</b> <b>consumption,</b> tap to tap time and increases productivity. In this research, method of production and optimum conditions for foamy slag in 200 tons {{electric arc furnace}} were investigated. The use of foamy slag in this research shows that it can reduce the electric energy consumption from 670 to 580 kwh/ton and also the melting time from 130 to 115 min. and the electric power input can be increase with foamy slag. It also shows that with foamy slag the optimum amount of FeO in slag is 20 - 24 percent and the optimum basicity is 2 - 2. 2...|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{activity}} in Portugal has been grouped in two broad sectors, the structural ceramics (roof tiles, bricks, sewer pipes and refractories) and the non-structural ceramics (wall and floor tiles, sanitary ware, tableware and decorative ware). In spite of reasonable raw materials sources (refractory clays and dolomite), Portugal {{is mostly a}} refractories user. The major steel plants (BF and EAF) account {{for most of the}} <b>refractories</b> <b>consumption</b> in the country. Official statistics report 7 refractory plants in activity {{at the beginning of the}} decade, producing 30 x 10 3 tons/year, valued at one third of the imported refractories. Although professional training in ceramics is carried out from school level (plant workers and pottery) up to University level (Ceramics engineers), specific teaching on refractories is done only at graduate level. A small part of this is subsidiary, included in the curricula of the various Metallurgy university degrees...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{years ago}} the {{introduction}} of oxy-fuel combustion in glass melting technol. in the Dutch glass industry was started. This paper gives an idea about the way this technol. was implemented during the past 10 yr in the Netherlands and the current situation. First a small overview of the Dutch glass industry is given, followed by an explanation about the environmental legislation in the Netherlands. Included is also {{a description of the}} first full scale oxy-fuel fired furnace and the experiences with emission reduction, energy <b>consumption,</b> <b>refractory</b> wear, and glass composition in this furnace. Furthermore a small overview is given of all oxy-fuel projects in the Netherlands since 1992. ...|$|R
40|$|Manganese imparts {{numerous}} beneficial mechanical properties. Hence {{it finds}} extensive application in iron, steel and non-ferrous sector. Prevalently, it {{is incorporated in}} the form of master alloys i. e. 'ferromanganese'. In India, ferromanganese is mainly the inexpensive and paramount source of availability of manganese. Various conventional and non-conventional techniques of ferromanganese production have been adopted in past and present. However, these techniques have demerits viz. high <b>refractory,</b> energy <b>consumption,</b> losses of valuables in slag and fumes. Also geographical co-ordinates of the plant restricted the manufacturer to pre-fer an appropriate process. Accordingly, the industrially implemented methods had reliance on availability of infrastructure, energy, mineral resources, grade of raw material, outlay of labor, environmental compati-bility of technique etc. In view of the liberalized economy and the gap scenario in the supply and demand of ferromanganese, the authors felt it indispensable to explicitly bridge up this vacuum by initially designing a simple energy con-serving, eco-friendly, low capital investment technique for decarburization of ferromanganese. Measurement of the data involved studying the impact of rate governing parameters on the process kinetics. This laboratory scale investigation is expected to escalate the Mn/C quotient of high carbon ferromanganese...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis: {{increasing}} {{the production rate}} of an Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) while also lowering overall cost can be a difficult challenge. The current situation at OneSteel in Australia is natural gas is less expensive than electricity to melt steel. The question then becomes {{how to use the}} natural gas efficiently. During the bore in and melting stages of the first and second buckets of scrap, the transfer of energy from the gas burners to the scrap metal is very high. Once the scrap has partially melted and a flat bath is obtained, the energy transfer drops dramatically. Determining the optimum time to turn off the gas burners to obtain maximum energy efficiency became the goal. GrafTech International's ArchiTech system can be used to measure electrical harmonics generated by the arc in the furnace. As the scrap is melted in the furnace, the harmonics generated decrease. OneSteel and GrafTech used this signal to develop a control loop to determine when to turn off the burners allowing them to maximize production rates. Power on time decreased, allowing for higher production rates and lower energy costs. Other consumables, such as graphite electrodes and <b>refractory</b> <b>consumption</b> should also decrease...|$|E
40|$|Considering the {{requirement}} for a reduction of <b>refractory</b> <b>consumption,</b> the present work investigated the fabrication of Al 2 O 3 -MgO-CaO-based refractory with BaO addition by means of solid-state reaction sintering. The effect of BaO addition on densification and {{the properties of the}} refractory were also discussed. Results indicated that the formation of calcium hexaluminate (CaO· 6 Al 2 O 3, or CA 6) grains with a high aspect ratio in the alumina-rich zone depressed the densification of the sample without BaO addition, resulting in a higher apparent porosity of 21. 2 %. When 6 wt. % BaO was added, a new phase of Ba 2 Mg 6 Al 28 O 50 (BAM) with a lower aspect ratio was formed and the densification of the sample with an apparent porosity of 5. 52 % was promoted. In addition, mechanical performance was significantly improved due to an increase in compactness and modification of the microstructure. The cold compressive strength increased from 348 MPa to 569 MPa and the flexural strength increased from 178 MPa to 243 MPa by addition of 6 wt. % BaO. Meanwhile, the breadth of the widest crack after the thermal shock test decreased from 7 μm to 1 μm in the refractory...|$|E
40|$|Ferrous {{industry}} slag is {{waste product}} of all steelmaking manufactures. These materials should be reused or stocked. There is abundant {{literature on the}} subject of reuse and recycling of blast furnace(BF), basic oxygen furnace(BOF), electric arc furnace(EAF). However, {{due to the fact that}} ladle furnaces(LF) have only been constructed in significant numbers since the 19802 ̆ 7 s, the relatively low slag volume in comparison to the other slags and also the high variability in slag chemistry, very few papers have been published on the recycling of ladle slag as separate materials. Studies reveal that there is significant percent calcium aluminate in ladle furnace slags which is the main compound of ladle fluxes. These fluxes are widely used to clean steel production processes. Hence, using of ladle furnace slags as a part of ladle fluxes can be considered as an economical recovery for these materials. In current study, the LF slags of Mobarakeh Steel Company (MSC) was separated from metallic part and also was crashed and sized. This powder was blended with some minerals in order to meet different chemical composition of synthetic fluxes. Plant trials were conducted to illustrate the useful chemical composition of flux through assessing the effect of LF slag addition on some criteria such as ladle slag fluidity and raw materials consumption. Eventually, suitable compound were specified. This flux not only provided the necessary fluidity but also reduced the raw materials consumption such as lime and metallic Aluminum. From the result analyses it can be predicted that the continuous use of this synthetic flux in addition to improve desulfurization in ladle, decrease the <b>refractory</b> <b>consumption...</b>|$|E
