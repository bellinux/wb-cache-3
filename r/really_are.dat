5|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics, who applauded how the producers brought out Wade's vocals over the instrumentation. It managed to chart on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart at number 21. The track later charted in the Netherlands and New Zealand at number 71 and 47, respectively. An official music video {{for the song}} premiered on VH1.com on June 27, 2001 that features effects to make objects look smaller than they <b>really</b> <b>are.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elves {{are born}} about one year from their {{conception}}. The {{day of their}} conception is celebrated, not the actual birthday itself. Their minds develop more quickly than their bodies; by their first year, they can speak, walk and even dance, and their quicker onset of mental maturity makes young Elves seem, to Men, older than they <b>really</b> <b>are.</b> Physical puberty comes in around their fiftieth to one hundredth year (by age fifty they reach their adult height), and by their first hundred years of life outside the womb all Elves are fully grown. Elven bodies eventually stop aging physically, while human bodies do not.|$|E

After finding out that she works in a tattoo parlor and claims {{to be able to}} see who people <b>really</b> <b>are,</b> Jack demands that she give him a tattoo. Achara is {{hesitant}} to give him a tattoo, but she does so anyway and tells him there will be consequences. The next morning, he is beaten up by her brother and other locals and told to leave.|$|E
5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you <b>really</b> <b>are,</b> and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
5|$|This latter {{theory is}} not heraldically tenable as the {{quarters}} in an achievement {{after the first}} and pronominal quarter brought into the family by marriage to heraldic heiresses cannot meaningfully exist {{on their own to}} represent the person who now quarters them. It is more probable then that the arms of the College <b>really</b> <b>are</b> those of Archbishop Rotherham and were assumed to be those of the College by John Speed who saw them on one of its buildings in 1605 when preparing his map. Lawrence Hall in Ship Street was given to Rotherham in 1476 and leased to Jesus in 1572. It may well have displayed the Archbishop’s arms in its structure as did the building {{on the south side of}} the front quad of Lincoln which he completed. These arms for Jesus College could not be confused with those of Lincoln as that College, since 1574, already had a complex tripartite coat granted to it by Richard Lee, Portcullis Pursuivant, in which the colour of the stags in the centre section had been changed to Or (gold) and their attitude to statant.|$|E
60|$|The {{thing that}} <b>really</b> <b>is</b> trying to tyrannise through {{government}} is Science. The {{thing that really}} does use the secular arm is Science. And the creed that <b>really</b> <b>is</b> levying tithes and capturing schools, the creed that <b>really</b> <b>is</b> enforced by fine and imprisonment, the creed that <b>really</b> <b>is</b> proclaimed not in sermons but in statutes, and spread not by pilgrims but by policemen--that creed is the great but disputed system of thought which began with Evolution and has ended in Eugenics. Materialism <b>is</b> <b>really</b> our established Church; for the Government will really help it to persecute its heretics. Vaccination, in its hundred years of experiment, has been disputed {{almost as much as}} baptism in its approximate two thousand. But it seems quite natural to our politicians to enforce vaccination; and it would seem to them madness to enforce baptism.|$|R
50|$|When he was {{breaking}} into baseball, Cisar lied about his birth date {{in order to}} make himself appear younger than he <b>really</b> <b>was.</b> As a result, many baseball references give him a 1912 birth date, even though he <b>really</b> <b>was</b> born in 1910, his daughter has said.|$|R
50|$|Parmenides professed {{that from}} our human {{point of view}} there are two aspects {{to the study of}} the {{universe}} of which we must be aware, on the one hand how we see it, and on the other how it must <b>really</b> <b>be.</b> Motion is a fact from our point of view, but Parmenides argues that as far as things must <b>really</b> <b>be,</b> it is logically impossible that motion could exist as we perceive it.|$|R

25|$|Antithesis {{refers to}} the often latent contradiction between two {{statements}} which when sufficiently considered {{can lead to the}} understanding of a third, unstated opinion. It often plays a part in relationship to parallelism: the reader has to consider whether what seem to be parallel constructions and ideas <b>really</b> <b>are</b> so.|$|E
25|$|Dan {{then goes}} on to explain how the spirit of anger works. It covers your eyes, and distorts your vision. Through this you do not {{recognise}} people for who they <b>really</b> <b>are.</b> In the case of Joseph, Dan speaks from experience. Furthermore, it disturbs the mind so that the Lord departs from it and Beliar inhabits it.|$|E
25|$|A seventh step {{could in}} {{principle}} be added, namely a big crisis in society which sparks off a revolution and overturns the existing capitalist system. In that case, {{it could be}} argued, the false masks are torn off, and people {{have to stand up}} for what they <b>really</b> <b>are,</b> and what they really believe in. But that is a possibility which Marx did not comprehensively theorize in Das Kapital.|$|E

25|$|Objective tests assume {{personality}} is consciously accessible {{and that it}} can be measured by self-report questionnaires. Research on psychological assessment has generally found objective tests to be more valid and reliable than projective tests. Critics have pointed to the Forer effect to suggest some of these appear to be more accurate and discriminating than they <b>really</b> <b>are.</b> Issues with these tests include false reporting because {{there is no way to}} tell if an individual is answering a question honestly or accurately.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Heinrich {{finds himself}} {{caught in the}} marital strife between his co-worker, Willi Dorsch, and Willi's wife, Erika. Embittered by her husband's infidelity, Erika wants a retaliatory affair with Heinrich. He resists, which leads to Erika accusing him of being a Jew and Heinrich being arrested by the Sicherheitspolizei. Only after Erika realizes that her {{accusation}} caused Heinrich's children to be taken also, she confesses that she lied and attempts to commit suicide, unaware the entire time that Heinrich and his family <b>really</b> <b>are</b> Jewish.|$|E
