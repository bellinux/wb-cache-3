5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised articular surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion.</b> Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion,</b> stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E

5|$|The {{shoulder}} of Acrocanthosaurus was {{limited in its}} <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> {{compared to that of}} humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backwards) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards), but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{extremely}} bird-like {{anatomy and}} close relationship to other dromaeosaurids, paleontologists hypothesize that Deinonychus was probably covered in feathers.

When conducting studies of {{such areas as}} the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> in the forelimbs, paleontologists like Phil Senter have taken the likely presence of wing feathers (as present in all known dromaeosaurs with skin impressions) into consideration.|$|E
5|$|Four {{anatomic}} features must {{be present}} for orotracheal intubation to be straightforward: adequate mouth opening (full <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> of the temporomandibular joint), sufficient pharyngeal space (determined {{by examining the}} back of the mouth), sufficient submandibular space (distance between the thyroid cartilage and the chin, the space into which the tongue must be displaced in order for the larygoscopist to view the glottis), and adequate extension of the cervical spine at the atlanto-occipital joint. If any of these variables is in any way compromised, intubation should be expected to be difficult.|$|E
40|$|The {{shoulder}} complex, {{also known}} as the glenohumeral joint is the most manoeuvrable {{and one of the most}} well used joints of the human body. Over time problems can occur with the glenohumeral joint and surrounding muscles, cartilage, tendons and ligaments caused by ageing or by over stressing the shoulder complex. This work examines the design of a new innovative glenohumeral test rig. The test rig was required to imitate the movement of the humerus in the human body and replicate all the <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion,</b> which it can move in when combined with the relevant bones, muscles, ligaments and tendons in the shoulder complex. A variable force also had to be applied to the glenoid in all <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion.</b> Research had to be undertaken in the <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the shoulder complex and the forces acting on the glenoid. Concept designs were initially created to mimic specific <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> motion; adduction, flexion, internal (medial) and external (lateral) rotation for example. The concepts were evolved and combined to develop a test rig that would replicate any axial movement of the shoulder. Research determined the most appropriate manufacturing processes and materials so that the test rig could be manufactured in the material laboratories...|$|R

However, Senter did not test whether the strong curvature of dromaeosaurid claws was also conducive to such activities.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{examination}} {{of a patient}} with ankle OCD often returns symptoms of joint effusion, crepitus, and diffuse or localized tenderness.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about {{designing}} structures that combine the dual functions of mechanical protection and flexibility <b>of</b> <b>motion.</b> The structures {{are inspired by}} principles observed in the ganoid squamation (scale assembly) of an ancient fish species called Polypteridae, which first appeared 96 million years ago. Prior work on Polypteridae has focused on understanding {{the role of the}} inherent material properties (e. g., stiffness, strength, etc.) of the individual bony scales to provide penetration resistance. Here, geometric design is explored at increasingly larger length scales including 1) morphometric features within individual scales, 2) morphometry of the individual scales as a whole, 3) scale-to-scale interconnections and anisotropic <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion,</b> and, lastly, 4) the entire assembled scale squamation and anisotropic <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> <b>of</b> the entire fish body. Experimental, computational, and mathematical methods employed were micro-computed tomography, microscopy, morphometric analysis, and three-dimensional printing of prototypes. The geometrical design principles discovered were related to biomechanical mobility and protection and then implemented into a generalized, functional design system which possesses similar anisotropic distinctive degrees <b>of</b> freedom and <b>ranges</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> as Polypteridae. The design system offers potential for applications in fields of transportation, military, and architecture. by Steffen H. Reichert. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|We {{believe there}} is a degree of {{inaccuracy}} in the usual methods <b>of</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>range</b> at the hip in the sagittal plane, ie, flexion-extension.

5|$|Like {{those of}} most other non-avian theropods, Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not {{make contact with the}} ground and were not used for locomotion; instead they served a predatory function. The {{discovery}} of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis of the function and <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus. The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far the joints could move without dislocating. In many of the joints, the bones did not fit together exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints, as is seen in many living archosaurs. Among other findings, the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backwards slightly, the elbow bent, and the claws facing medially (inwards).|$|E
5|$|Non-surgical {{treatment}} is rarely an option {{as the ability}} for articular cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, stem cell transplantation, and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of immobilization and physical therapy. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion.</b> During the immobilization period, isometric exercises, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.|$|E
5|$|Studies by Phil Senter in 2007 {{conducted}} on P. neimongoliensis and P. mongoliensis {{concluded that the}} forelimbs of these taxa (and likely those of other Psittacosaurus species) were too short (only about 58% {{as long as the}} hindlimbs) to reach the ground, and their <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>motion</b> indicates they could neither be pronated nor generate propulsive force for locomotion, suggesting that Psittacosaurus was entirely bipedal. The forelimbs were also too short to be used in digging or bringing food to the mouth, and Senter suggested that if Psittacosaurus needed to dig depressions in the ground it may have used its hindlimbs instead. The forelimbs could be used for two-handed grasping of objects or scratching the body, but due to their extremely limited flexibility and reach, they could have only been used to grasp objects very close to the belly or sides of the animal and could have scratched only the belly, flank and knees. Even though the hands could not reach the mouth, Psittacosaurus could have still used them to carry nesting material or food to a desired location.|$|E

Methods: Twenty-two individuals post-stroke with hemiparesis (age range: 48 - 88 years) walked on a pool floor {{and on an}} aquatic treadmill at a matched speed. Twenty-two age-matched healthy contro ls were also examined for comparison. All subjects walked in the water at the chest depth (xiphoid process) for matched conditions. Lower- limb motions were captured by an underwater motion analysis system with six underwater lenses.
