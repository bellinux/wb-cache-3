50|$|The Newman-Keuls or Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) {{method is}} a {{stepwise}} multiple comparisons procedure {{used to identify}} sample means that are significantly different from each other. It was named after Student (1927), D. Newman, and M. Keuls. This procedure is often used as a post-hoc test whenever {{a significant difference between}} three or more sample means has been revealed by an analysis of variance (ANOVA). The Newman-Keuls method is similar to Tukey's <b>range</b> <b>test</b> as both procedures use Studentized range statistics. Unlike Tukey's <b>range</b> <b>test,</b> the Newman-Keuls method uses different critical values for different pairs of mean comparisons. Thus, the procedure is more likely to reveal significant differences between group means and to commit type I errors by incorrectly rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true. In other words, the Neuman-Keuls procedure is more powerful but less conservative than Tukey's <b>range</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Once calculated, the {{computed}} q value can {{be compared}} to a q critical value (or [...] ), which {{can be found in a}} q distribution table based on the significance level (...) , the error degrees of freedom (...) from the ANOVA table, and the range (...) of sample means to be tested. If the computed q value is equal to or greater than the q critical value, then the null hypothesis (H0: μA = μB) for that specific range of means can be rejected. Because the number of means within a range changes with each successive pairwise comparison, the critical value of the q statistic also changes with each comparison, which makes the Neuman-Keuls method more lenient and hence more powerful than Tukey's <b>range</b> <b>test.</b> Thus, if a pairwise comparison was found to be significantly different using the Newman-Keuls method, it may not necessarily be significantly different when analyzed with Tukey's <b>range</b> <b>test.</b> Conversely, if the pairwise comparison was found not to be significantly different using the Newman-Keuls method, it cannot in any way be significantly different when tested with Tukey's <b>range</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E
