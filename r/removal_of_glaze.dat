50|$|The {{changing}} fire {{life safety}} requirements for high rise flats caused Edgewater Towers {{to be treated}} as a test case for fire life safety and Edgewater Towers was required to install an improved fire life safety system by the Port Phillip Council in the late 1980s. The Port Phillip Council required Edgewater Towers to have a further fire life safety upgrade in 2002 and was subsequently fitted with a fire sprinkler protection system and fully addressable automatic fire detection and alarm system between 2005 and 2008, and certified complete 2014. The earlier fire life safety upgrade between 1989 and 1995 included fire hose reels, a smoke and heat detection system, enclosure of the previously open West stairwell, sealing of floor penetrations, closure of the mail chute, emergency and exit lighting, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>glazed</b> timber doors in the corridors, modifications to both stairs to discharge directly to outdoors, fire rated doors, fire rated enclosed balcony ends and blocking up corridor clerestory glazing to each flat to achieve the necessary 1-hour fire-resistance rating. The sprinkler fire protection system was activated in August 2013, when a fire started on a balcony on the 11th. floor. The Age newspaper carried the story. Edgewater Towers has an Essential Safety Measures, Certificate of Final Inspection dated 14 July 2014 displayed in the lobby.|$|R

However, considering lots <b>of</b> <b>glazed</b> ceramics in the shipwreck which would be easily eroded by acid, the chemical method doesn’t {{seem to be a}} suitable method in this case. In our work, different types of concretions were analyzed, using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Based on those analyses, a physical method consisting of heating and boiling to soften and remove the concretions from ceramics in the “Nanhai I” shipwreck was tested.|$|R

5000|$|Light Absorption - light {{absorption}} <b>of</b> <b>glazing</b> is {{the light that}} is neither transmitted nor reflected by the glazing. Since light is not necessarily absorbed uniformly, some wavelengths may be transmitted more than others, causing the transmitted color to be distorted. A good way to detect {{light absorption}} <b>of</b> <b>glazing</b> is so-called white paper test. This test, used to detect the transmission color <b>of</b> <b>glazing,</b> involves placing a piece <b>of</b> <b>glazing</b> on white paper, and comparing the paper's color with and without the glass. A slight greenish tint will indicate the presence of iron oxide in the raw materials used to produce clear float glass. Additional transmitted colors may result from the absorption of any applied coatings.|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of an analytical study of the functioning <b>of</b> <b>glazing</b> at two different yet interacting levels: {{at the level of the}} building as a whole, and at that <b>of</b> <b>glazing</b> as a building element. At the building level, analyses were performed on a sample of high-rise business buildings in Slovenia, where the glazing"s share of the building envelope was calculated, and estimates of the proportion of shade provided by external blinds were made. It is shown that, especially in the case of modern buildings with large proportions <b>of</b> <b>glazing</b> and buildings with no shading devices, careful glazing design is needed, together with a sound knowledge of energy performance. In the second part of the article, the energy balance values relating to selected types <b>of</b> <b>glazing</b> are presented, including solar control glazing. The paper demonstrates the need for a holistic energy approach to glazing problems, as well as how different types <b>of</b> <b>glazing</b> can be methodically compared, thus improving the design of sustainability-orientated buildings...|$|R

Transparency <b>of</b> <b>glazed</b> roofs {{does not}} depend on glass as material, which enables an {{admission}} of daylight to the interior, but it depends on the share <b>of</b> the <b>glazed</b> part <b>of</b> the canopy and their structural part. Spaces <b>of</b> <b>glazed</b> atria and courtyards of historical buildings are covered with very difficult shape <b>of</b> <b>glazed</b> canopies, which are supported by various types of load-bearing structures. In contemporary architecture glazed atria are used for the reason of saving energy and lighting up the inner spaces. New types of structures and using glass in load-bearing function in glass canopies are important thanks to their structural subtlety, where the structure covers slight part <b>of</b> <b>glazed</b> canopy. The result of clever ideas and modern technology are lightweight structures of bold forms and spans. In this context transparency became a new expression element of architecture...|$|R

40|$|The Silicone-Wax Filler {{discussed}} in this paper was developed for a reputed porcelain tile manufacturing company {{for use as a}} surface filler/sealer to a grade of floor tile called the polished tile, to make the tile stain resistance. Further investigations on the sealing characteristics on other surfaces have revealed that the filler is suitable as a surface filler/sealer to many surfaces such as marble, granite, terra cotta, terrazzo, cement and timber. The polished tile is a tile with a polished surface closely resembling a marble or granite surface. This tile is different to the normal glazed tile in that after the firing process the surface is cut and polished to give high reflection. In the cutting and polished process, 0. 3 - 0. 5 mm <b>of</b> the <b>glazed</b> surface is removed, resulting in a polished surface, which has microscopic pores on the surface, due to the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> the <b>glazed</b> layer in the cutting and polishing process. The tile can get stained easily because coloured materials such as food stains, mud stains and organic stains can get into the surface pores. The <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> such stains is extremely difficult, if not impossible, because, the pores are so small that a surfactant cannot easily enter these pores to remove the stain. This problem is also common to terrazzo, marble, granite and terracotta floors. Due to the surface staining problem of polished tiles the said company had many customer complaints and had a special cleaning team visit such customers and clean floor stains using expensive and dangerous chemicals. As the chemicals used were hazardous they could not be recommended for client use. To overcome this problem, the only option available to the company was to apply a surface filler/sealer to the polished tile after the manufacturing process so that the surface became stain resistant. At the time the author was requested to develop the filler the company was using a surface filler imported from Italy at a very high price. The cost of applying the surface filler was approximately Rs. 10 /= per sqft. After several months of experiments and trials the author was able to develop a Silicone- Wax Surface Filler, which had sealing and stain resistant properties {{similar to that of the}} imported filler. The Research and Development Division of the tile manufacturing company carried out rigerous tests on the filler for coverage, stain resistance, discolouration, durability and other possible effects that could arise after the application, with time. The filler has passed all these tests and the cost has been found to be l/ 3 rd of that of the imported filler. The filler is now used by the said tile manufacturing company, to give stain resistance to the polished tile...|$|R

40|$|The {{trend for}} modern {{buildings}} {{to be designed}} with large glazing areas in the exterior envelope is becoming more popular than ever before.
