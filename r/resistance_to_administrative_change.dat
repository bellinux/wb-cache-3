The impact of background variables on employees’ assessment of change resistance causes is also examined.

The Georgian budget at that time was largely financed by foreign sources. Following the Rose Revolution the country’s financial situation has improved, hyperinflation was overcome and public revenues have steadily increased due <b>to</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>changes</b> and tax law reforms. tax reform, fiscal policy, state budget, revenues and expenditures...|$|R

40|$|Deeds, or charters, {{dealing with}} {{property}} rights, provide a continuous documentation {{which can be}} used by historians to study the evolution of social, economic and political changes. This study is concerned with charters (written in Latin) dating from the tenth through early fourteenth centuries in England. Of these, at least one million were left undated, largely due <b>to</b> <b>administrative</b> <b>changes</b> introduced by William the Conqueror in 1066. Correctly dating such charters is of vital importance in the study of English medieval history. This paper is concerned with computer-automated statistical methods for dating such document collections, with the goal of reducing the considerable efforts required to date them manually and of improving the accuracy of assigned dates. Proposed methods are based on such data as the variation over time of word and phrase usage, and on measures of distance between documents. The extensive (and dated) Documents of Early England Data Set (DEEDS) maintained at the University of Toronto was used for this purpose.
