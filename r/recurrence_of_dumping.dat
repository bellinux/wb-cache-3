40|$|The WTO Anti-Dumping (AD) Agreement {{requires}} that anti-dumping duties be reviewed {{at least every}} five years (Article 11. 3); pursuant to this requirement, domestic trade authorities in the US are charged {{with the task of}} making a determination as to whether, after five years, revoking the duties would be likely to lead to continuation or <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> (Commerce) and of material injury (ITC). This is called a Sunset Review; a negative determination of likelihood, either with respect to dumping or injury, will result in the duties expiring, the sun setting, as it were. ...|$|E
40|$|Economists have {{increasingly}} {{become involved in}} trade remedy and litigation matters that call for economic interpretation or quantification. The literature {{on the use of}} econometric methods in response to legal requirements of trade policy is rather limited. This article contributes to filling this gap by demonstrating the efficacy of using a simple 2 ̆ 018 probabilistic 2 ̆ 019 model in analyzing the 2 ̆ 018 likelihood 2 ̆ 019 of injury to the local industry concerned, following a finding of continuation or <b>recurrence</b> <b>of</b> <b>dumping</b> (or countervailable subsidies). The legal concept of 2 ̆ 018 likelihood 2 ̆ 019 is not only particularly well-suited to illustrate the systemic need for trade lawyers and economists to cooperate. It is also of imminent practical relevance with a groundswell of 2 ̆ 018 sunset 2 ̆ 019 reviews looming on the horizon. We discuss the significance of economic analysis for trade remedy investigations by reviewing the literature, the applicable WTO rules and, in particular, the pertinent case law. The potential value of probabilistic simulations for 2 ̆ 018 likelihood 2 ̆ 019 determinations is exemplified using a real-world application. Using data from past United States International Trade Commission investigations, we find that a probabilistic model that takes account of the uncertainty surrounding economic parameters reduces the risk of misjudging the effect on the domestic industry of a termination of trade remedies...|$|E
