60|$|Yes, I think I may {{say that}} I am {{satisfied}} so far with the aspect of things {{in relation to the}} book. You see there has scarcely been time yet to give any except a sanguine or despondent judgment--I mean, there is scarcely room yet for forming a very <b>rational</b> <b>inference</b> of what will ultimately be, without the presentiments of hope or fear. The book came out too late in August for any chance of a mention in the September magazines, and at the dead time of year, when the very critics were thinking more of holiday innocence than of their carnivorous instincts. This will not hurt it ultimately, although it might have hurt a novel. The regular critics will come back to it; and in the meantime the newspaper critics are noticing it all round, with more or less admissions to its advantage. The 'Atlas' is the best of the newspapers for literary notices; and it spoke graciously on the whole; though I do protest against being violently attached to a 'school.' I have faults enough, I know; but it is just to say that they are at least my own. Well, then! It is true that the 'Westminster Review' says briefly what is great praise, and promises to take the earliest opportunity of reviewing me 'at large.' So that with regard to the critics, {{there seems to be a}} good prospect. Then I have had some very pleasant private letters--one from Carlyle; an oath from Miss Martineau to give her whole mind to the work and tell me her free and full opinion, which I have not received yet; an assurance from an acquaintance of Mrs. Jameson that she was much pleased. But the letter which pleased me most was addressed to me by a professional critic, personally unknown to me, who wrote to say that he had traced me up, step by step, ever since I began to print, and that my last volumes were so much better than any preceding them, and were such living books, that they restored to him the impulses of his youth and constrained him to thank me for the pleasant emotions they had excited. I cannot say the name of the writer of this letter, because he asked me not to do so, but of course it was very pleasant to read. Now you will not call me vain for speaking of this. I would not speak of it; only I want (you see) to prove to you how faithfully and gratefully I have a trust in your kindness and sympathy. It is certainly the best kindness to speak the truth to me. I have written those poems as well as I could, and I hope to write others better. I have not reached my own ideal; and I cannot expect to have satisfied other people's expectation. But it is (as I sometimes say) the least ignoble part of me, that I love poetry better than I love my own successes in it.|$|E

[...] For Dennett, Reppert observes, Darwin's dangerous idea is that the latter [...] "are the only acceptable types of explanation", a position that [...] "has become orthodoxy in such varied disciplines as evolutionary biology, cognitive science and artificial intelligence", as well as [...] "in Anglo-American philosophy in general". C. S.

5000|$|Support: Reasoning {{requires}} {{insight into}} logical relations. A process of reasoning (P therefore Q) is rational {{only if the}} reasoner sees that Q follows from, or is supported by, P, and accepts Q on that basis. Thus, reasoning is trustworthy (or [...] "valid", as Lewis sometimes says) only if it involves {{a special kind of}} causality, namely, rational insight into logical implication or evidential support. If a bit of reasoning can be fully explained by nonrational causes, such as fibers firing in the brain or a bump on the head, then the reasoning is not reliable, and cannot yield knowledge. Consider this example: Person A refuses to go near the neighbor’s dog because he had a bad childhood experience with dogs. Person B refuses to go near the neighbor’s dog because one month ago he saw it attack someone. Both have given a reason for staying away from the dog, but person A’s reason is the result of nonrational causes, while person B has given an explanation for his behavior following from <b>rational</b> <b>inference</b> (animals exhibit patterns of behavior; these patterns are likely to be repeated; this dog has exhibited aggression towards someone who approached it; {{there is a good chance}} that the dog may exhibit the same behavior towards me if I approach it). Consider a second example: person A says that he is afraid to climb to the 8th story of a bank building because he and humans in general have a natural fear of heights resulting from the processes of evolution and natural selection. He has given an explanation of his fear, but since his fear results from nonrational causes (natural selection), his argument does not follow from logical inference.|$|E

As a consequence, the model’s predictions systematically deviate from classical, purely statistical norms of diagnostic inference.

40|$|A Bayesian {{approach}} is developed for making inferences about the rate of agreement in a particular decision problem.

In con-trast, many models of <b>rational</b> <b>inference</b> treat the mind as a Laplacean Demon, {{equipped}} with un-limited time, knowledge, and computational might. Following H.

In particular, we look at what happens when the costs of reporting are negligible and the cost of being interrogated by the police are high in a rational choice model of crime and crime reporting. Perverse equilibria where everyone reports or no one reports (and thus reports have no informational value) emerge. This happens both in a model where police make <b>rational</b> <b>inferences</b> about crime based on reports as well as in a model where police investigate according to fixed rules operating under a fixed budget. Importantly, generating more reports about crime could actually increase equilibrium crime rates. This occurs via a resource thinning effect caused by "too many " reports.

We also show how different ways of profiling certain groups of people can either increase or decrease crime rates in the profiled group...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop and}} test {{a model of}} joint {{determination}} of the rate of economic growth {{and the results of}} presidential and Congressional elections in the United States. In our model, economic agents and voters have rational expectations. Economic policy varies as a function of control of the White House and the two-party shares in Congress. Politics affects growth through unanticipated policy shifts following the outcome of presidential elections. The economy influences elections as voters use past realizations of growth to make <b>rational</b> <b>inferences</b> about the "competency" level of the incumbent administration. Elections are also influenced by voters using their midterm Congressional votes to moderate the policies of the incumbent administration. The theoretical model is used to generate a recursive system of equations in which the dependent variables are the growth rate and the vote shares in presidential and Congressional elections. The theory implies several restrictions on the equations. Tests of the restrictions generally support the model; however, the results support the traditional view of naive retrospective voting as well as the "rational" retrospective voting posited in the model. ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonplace in}} {{artificial}} intelligence {{to draw a}} distinction between the explicit knowledge appearing in an agent's memory and the implicit knowledge it represents. Many AI theories of knowledge assume this representation relation is logical, that is, that implicit knowledge is derived from expficit knowledge via a logic. Such theories, however, are limited in their ability to treat incomplete or inconsistent knowledge in useful ways. We suggest that a more illuminating theory of nonlogical inferences is that they are cases of <b>rational</b> <b>inference,</b> in which the agent rationally (in the sense of decision theory) chooses the conclusions it wishes to adopt. Thus in <b>rational</b> <b>inference,</b> the implicit beliefs depend on the agent's preferences about its states of belief and on its beliefs about its states of belief {{as well as on the}} beliefs themselves.

40|$|AbstractHumans skillfully reason about others’ emotions, a {{phenomenon}} we term affective cognition. Despite its importance, few formal, quantitative theories {{have described the}} mechanisms supporting this phenomenon. We propose that affective cognition involves applying domain-general reasoning processes to domain-specific content knowledge. Observers’ knowledge about emotions is represented in rich and coherent lay theories, which comprise consistent relationships between situations, emotions, and behaviors. Observers utilize this knowledge in deciphering social agents’ behavior and signals (e. g., facial expressions), {{in a manner similar}} to <b>rational</b> <b>inference</b> in other domains. We construct a computational model of a lay theory of emotion, drawing on tools from Bayesian statistics, and test this model across four experiments in which observers drew inferences about others’ emotions in a simple gambling paradigm. This work makes two main contributions. First, the model accurately captures observers’ flexible but consistent reasoning about the ways that events and others’ emotional responses to those events relate to each other. Second, our work models the problem of emotional cue integration—reasoning about others’ emotion from multiple emotional cues—as <b>rational</b> <b>inference</b> via Bayes’ rule, and we show that this model tightly tracks human observers’ empirical judgments. Our results reveal a deep structural relationship between affective cognition and other forms of inference, and suggest wide-ranging applications to basic psychological theory and psychiatry...|$|E
40|$|Why {{are human}} inferences {{sometimes}} remarkably {{close to the}} Bayesian ideal and other times systematically biased? One notable instance of this discrepancy is that tasks where the candidate hypotheses are explicitly available result in close to <b>rational</b> <b>inference</b> over the hypothesis space, whereas tasks requiring the self-generation of hypotheses produce systematic deviations from <b>rational</b> <b>inference.</b> We propose that these deviations arise from algorithmic processes approximating Bayes' rule. Specifically in our account, hypotheses are generated stochastically from a sampling process, such that the sampled hypotheses form a Monte Carlo approximation of the posterior. While this approximation will converge to the true posterior {{in the limit of}} infinite samples, we take a small number of samples as we expect that the number of samples humans take is limited by time pressure and cognitive resource constraints. We show that this model recreates several well-documented experimental findings such as anchoring and adjustment, subadditivity, superadditivity, the crowd within as well as the self-generation effect, the weak evidence, and the dud alternative effects. Additionally, we confirm the model's prediction that superadditivity and subadditivity can be induced within the same paradigm by manipulating the unpacking and typicality of hypotheses, in 2 experiments.

40|$|McDermott {{has written}} a fine {{critique}} of the logicist views that most reasoning is deductive and that logic is the proper theory of thinking, and I largely agree with his observations. But he laments abandoning the attractions of the logicist method along with its flaws. I believe this disappointment is unnecessary if the flaws and attractions are separated as follows. The underlying flaw in the logicist view is the misperception that reasoning is {{an aspect of the}} agent’s structure rather than one of its activities. (See [Harman 1986] and § 1. 1 of [Doyle 1979].) When inferences are viewed as filling in part of a Platonic logical structure, it is natural to hope them deductive. When inferences are actions carrying the agent from initial states of mind and sets of attitudes to new states and attitudes, it is instead natural to hope them rational—in particular, rational according to the agent’s own attitudes at the time—or intentional, according to rationally adopted plans for reasoning. But as sketched below, <b>rational</b> <b>inferences</b> are typically non-deductive.

40|$|We analyze a {{model of}} {{learning}} and belief formation in networks in which agents follow Bayes rule yet they do not recall their history of past observations and cannot reason about how other agents' beliefs are formed. They do so by making <b>rational</b> <b>inferences</b> about their observations which include a sequence of independent and identically distributed private signals {{as well as the}} actions of their neighboring agents at each time. Successive applications of Bayes rule to the entire history of past observations lead to forebodingly complex inferences: due to lack of knowledge about the global network structure, and unavailability of private observations, as well as third party interactions preceding every decision. Such difficulties make Bayesian updating of beliefs an implausible mechanism for social learning. To address these complexities, we consider a Bayesian without Recall model of inference. On the one hand, this model provides a tractable framework for analyzing the behavior of rational agents in social networks. On the other hand, this model also provides a behavioral foundation for the variety of non-Bayesian update rules in the literature. We present the implications of various choices for the structure of the action space and utility functions for such agents and investigate the properties of learning, convergence, and consensus in special cases...|$|R
40|$|A {{special issue}} of the journal "Cognitive neuropsychiatry", Vol. 15, Issue 1 - 3. Delusional beliefs have {{sometimes}} been considered as <b>rational</b> <b>inferences</b> from abnormal experiences. We explore this idea in more detail, making the following points. First, the abnormalities of cognition that initially prompt the entertaining of a delusional belief are not always conscious and since we prefer to restrict the term “experience” to consciousness we refer to “abnormal data” rather than “abnormal experience”. Second, we argue that in relation to many delusions (we consider seven) one can clearly identify what the abnormal cognitive data are which prompted the delusion and what the neuropsychological impairment is which is responsible for the occurrence of these data; but one can equally clearly point to cases where this impairment is present but delusion is not. So the impairment is not sufficient for delusion to occur: a second cognitive impairment, one that affects the ability to evaluate beliefs, must also be present. Third (and this is the main thrust of our paper), we consider in detail what the nature of the inference is that leads from the abnormal data to the belief. This is not deductive inference and it is not inference by enumerative induction; it is abductive inference. We offer a Bayesian account of abductive inference and apply it to the explanation of delusional belief. 27 page(s...|$|R
