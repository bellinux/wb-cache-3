5|$|When the Shawnee Purchase Units {{were first}} established, {{temporary}} headquarters {{were set up}} in Room 303, First Trust and Savings Bank Building, Harrisburg, Illinois. This was the only modern office building {{in the town of}} Harrisburg suitable for headquarters, and the forest has continued to occupy this building as Supervisor's offices. Expansion of the offices has continued since 1933, until today (June 1938), ten <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> third floor, and four <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fourth floor, are leased by the Forest Service. Employees who were here during {{the early days of the}} forest tell of the chaos and confusion caused by the small space under lease, the incoming shipments of equipment and supplies, and the constant inflow of new personnel.|$|E
5|$|During {{the liberation}} of Manila {{buildings}} of the University in Intramuros, {{as well as in}} Sampaloc were damaged or destroyed. The facility in Intramuros was burned on February 8, 1944. As for those in Sampaloc, though they were not destroyed, some portions were slightly damaged during the shellings, including the <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> West of the Main Building, some rooms of the Education building, and the University gymnasium.|$|E

5|$|Having {{served for}} many years as Moore's Coleridge Cottage Inn, the {{building}} was acquired for the nation in 1908, and the following year it was {{handed over to the}} National Trust. On 23 May 1998, following a £25,000 appeal by the Friends of Coleridge and the National Trust, two further <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor were opened.|$|E
5|$|The White House today {{serves as}} a hotel and {{has a number of}} conference <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground floor, {{following}} extensive renovations in the 1990s. The hotel comprises 41 guest bedrooms (35 en-suite) across the White House and its modern extension. The White House also houses a bar in the Group Room, and a canteen-style restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The pool {{house was}} built in 1968 and is brick with wood-framed {{casement}} windows. It is a divided brick building with locker <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> larger west section and a refreshment area on the smaller east section. The west section has a flat roof, and the east section has a shallow hipped roof with a broad overhang. The building does {{not contribute to the}} former historic estate.|$|E

5|$|The <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{north and}} east sides of the third floor were {{accessed}} via the private staircase. The rooms were two family rooms, one above the oratory and a larger one above the great chamber. The larger one had a fireplace and a garderobe, and was likely the baron's bedroom; the smaller room was either the chaplain's quarters or a family room. Both were connected via a lobby {{at the top of}} the private staircase.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor, which were damaged {{in the fire}} of 1884, which also has a small {{entrance}} door which was accessed via exterior stone steps which no longer exist. There was also a latrine in a turret which no longer exists. There are small traceried arched windows.|$|E
5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tank top deck had vertically closing doors {{that could be}} controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or from the deck above.|$|E

5|$|Either {{side of the}} Saloon are {{two smaller}} drawing rooms (8, 10), which would {{originally}} have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would {{have taken place in}} the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of Lord Tyrconnel in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of Baroque state <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the 3rd Earl Brownlow had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested.|$|E
5|$|For {{the second}} year in succession, special trains were laid on for the final to {{transport}} fans down from Blackburn. However, due to issues with the Olympic fans from the previous year destroying tea-rooms at stations on the route, the railway instead closed all refreshment <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line {{on the day of the}} match. Additional stands were built at the Oval for the match at both the Gasometre end and on the west side, as the Pavilion was reserved for members of the Surrey County Cricket Club.|$|E
5|$|Hearst first {{bought the}} monastery {{intending}} {{to replace the}} family retreat at Wyntoon, {{on the bank of}} the McCloud River near Mount Shasta in remote Northern California. The original building was his mother's Bernard Maybeck-designed fantasy chalet which burned down in 1929. Hearst wanted to replace it with a great stone building fitted with towers and turrets—an eccentric castle folly that was to be larger than its predecessor. To prepare for the arrival of the Spanish stones, Morgan drew up plans with the monastery's chapter house serving as the castle's entrance hall, and the large church enclosing a swimming pool. Other stones were designated as cladding for walls and <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground floor.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1960s, {{prosecutors}} began {{claiming the}} building was a national headquarters for a multimillion-dollar racketeering operation. On April 20, 1988, the FBI and Chicago police Internal Affairs Division investigators raided the On Leong Merchants Association Building, confiscated gambling paraphernalia from a casino hidden on the building's second floor and seized $350,000 from a vault. Assistant U.S. Attorney John J. Scully asserted that the Association had collected $6million in illegal gambling profits between 1966 and 1988. The building was seized by the US federal government two months later under federal racketeering statutes. Other than several first-floor shops, the building sat empty for almost five years. <b>Rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper floors fell into disrepair, with paint peeling and faded ornamentation in pieces on the floor.|$|E
5|$|Inside, the Hatfield Library {{contains}} a 24-hour study area, private study rooms, a classroom, the university's archives, and listening <b>rooms.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> main floor is the circulation desk, reference section, and work stations, among others. The building also holds a formal reception area, the Mark O. Hatfield Room, and the Hatfield archives that contain the former Senator's papers, both {{located on the}} second floor. Interior space was left mainly open to allow for flexibility with the evolving needs and technology of the library. Artist Dean Larson painted the portrait of Hatfield that hangs in the library.|$|E
5|$|Longfellow {{moved to}} Cambridge {{to take a}} job at Harvard College as Smith Professor of Modern Languages and of Belles Lettres. A friend, Cornelius Conway Felton, {{recommended}} that Longfellow rent a room {{on the third floor of}} the home of a Professor Stearns on Kirkland Street; Longfellow stayed there for the 1836–1837 academic year. He disliked the place, however, and sought out better accommodations. Beginning in the summer of 1837, he rented <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> east side of the second floor of the home on Brattle Street, now owned by Elizabeth Craigie. At first, Mrs. Craigie thought he was a student at Harvard and refused to rent to him until he convinced her that he was a professor as well as the author of the book she was reading, Outre-Mer.|$|E

5|$|Longfellow {{returned}} to the United States in 1836 and took up the professorship at Harvard. He was required to live in Cambridge {{to be close to}} the campus and, therefore, rented rooms at the Craigie House in the spring of 1837. The home was built in 1759 and was the headquarters of George Washington during the Siege of Boston beginning in July 1775. Elizabeth Craigie owned the home, the widow of Andrew Craigie, and she rented <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second floor. Previous boarders included Jared Sparks, Edward Everett, and Joseph Emerson Worcester. It is preserved today as the Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site.|$|E
5|$|On the interior, Strickland {{placed the}} grand {{staircase}} {{that connects the}} three levels immediately behind the portico in the central core of the structure. The floor system is composed of fired-clay jack arches supported on steel I-beams, a common feature of warehouses and other long-span structures. On the second floor, many of the larger rooms, which were used for coining and melting, contain ceilings with beautiful high arches supported by the walls and freestanding piers. The smaller rectangular <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> second level (and the basement), such as the former superintendent's office, also contain these arched ceilings with a single groin vault. The basement formerly contained the boilers inside a brick cage, but now contain museum exhibits devoted to the minting processes {{as well as the}} Coin Vault at the Mint, a coin shop.|$|E
5|$|The John Deere House {{was built}} in 1836 when Deere arrived in Grand Detour and the {{building}} was added onto as his family grew. It is furnished with period furniture and household objects {{that would have been}} common around the time the Deere family occupied the home. The house has two levels with four <b>rooms</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> main level and two rooms upstairs. Each of the upstairs rooms is accessible via a private staircase and it is believed one of the rooms was used by Deere's apprentices while the other was used as a children's bedroom.|$|E
