40|$|This {{abstract}} {{traces the}} {{various stages of}} geomorphological evolution of the plain area around Modena from the VI millennium B. C. to the Present, through reconstruction of the ancient landscape and human settlements. Geomorphological investigations {{have led to the}} implementation of a Micro-relief Map, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), a Map of surface deposits and a Geomorphological Map. As regards archaeological studies, it was possible to connect archaeological findings with geomorphological surface evidence with a good level of precision. The topographic and stratigraphic positions of archaeological finds have been compared with paleoenvironmental data, in order to reconstruct the evolution of the territory. The comparison of geomorphological and archaeological data allowed many fluvial forms to be dated. In particular, it was interesting to observe the westward shift of the River Panaro from the Bronze Age and the connection of many sites of this period with the fluvial forms identified. In addition, {{in the area of the}} historical centre of Modena it was possible to reconstruct the ancient soil levels, starting from Roman times, and measure the thickness of archaeological stratigraphies and alluvial deposition layers. This led to a model of fluvial evolution which shows the aggradation of the plain where <b>the</b> <b>watercourses</b> <b>turn</b> from deepened riverbeds to hanging riverbeds...|$|R
60|$|It {{was easy}} work to {{dismount}} and crawl {{to the edge}} of the creek. But a fog lay over the water, and he could see the geese but indistinctly. Leaving the creek bank, he ran silently to where <b>the</b> <b>watercourse</b> made a <b>turn</b> and then crawled forward in the brush. Soon the fog lifted once more, and he saw the geese resting on the water close to the bend. He fired quickly and brought down the largest of the flock, while the others lost no time in disappearing. It was a good fat goose and made excellent eating.|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> United Nations <b>Watercourses</b> Convention {{entered into}} force in August 2014. Despite {{overwhelming}} support when signed in 1997, the ratification {{process has been}} slow. As a binding treaty, <b>the</b> <b>Watercourses</b> Convention provides hope that its provisions will articulate legal principles of transboundary water management capable of promoting cooperation and regional agreements. Despite entry into force, however, global support for <b>the</b> <b>Watercourses</b> Convention is weak, concurrent efforts to develop treaty regimes governing water resources create competition for resources and may obscure understandings of international water law, and the foundational principles of <b>the</b> <b>Watercourses</b> Convention remain ambiguous. These limitations are illustrated in {{a case study of}} the discordant hydropolitics of the Nile River Basin – perhaps <b>the</b> most significant <b>watercourse</b> lacking a cooperative management agreement. This article provides an analysis of international water law and the limitations of <b>the</b> <b>Watercourses</b> Convention, considering <b>the</b> implications of entry into force. While <b>the</b> <b>Watercourses</b> Convention creates a workable framework for negotiating regional agreements, low levels of support from UN member states, competing treaty instruments, and ambiguous legal principles limit the potential impact of <b>the</b> <b>Watercourses</b> Convention...|$|R

40|$|Urban {{development}} {{alters the}} composition of surface materials by introducing significant areas of asphalt, concrete and other impervious surfaces over previously porous soils. The impervious materials prevent rainfall from soaking into the ground thereby increasing the amount or volume of rainfall that flows into nearby <b>watercourses.</b> In addition <b>the</b> drainage system is enhanced through swales, curbs and gutters, catchbasins and stormsewers such that these flows are drained {{as quickly as possible}} to <b>the</b> <b>watercourse.</b> <b>The</b> result is an increase in flow magnitude and duration in <b>the</b> <b>watercourse.</b> This impact is referred to as hydromodification. Commensurate with the change in flow rate and volume, urbanization results in alteration of the physical characteristics and mass of sediments delivered to <b>the</b> <b>watercourse.</b> Following disruption of the soils during the active construction phase, which results in an increase in sediment inputs to <b>the</b> <b>watercourse,</b> <b>the</b> landscape is stabilized as lawns or paved areas are established and the sediment yield declines significantly relative to pre-development agricultural conditions. This impact is referred to as alteration of the sediment-regime. The quality of stormwater runoff is also altered by urban development and the human activities that take place in urban areas which contribute to the pollution of runoff and the resulting degradation o...|$|R

50|$|Because of the {{steepness}} {{and orientation}} of <b>the</b> Darling Scarp, <b>watercourses</b> run off <b>the</b> scarp in a westerly direction. On reaching the Swan Coastal Plain, they encounter two obstacles: firstly, the high permeability {{of the soil}} results {{in the loss of}} much water. Much flow is lost, and some watercourses simply cease to flow, for example, Wungong Brook, Cardup Brook, and Manjedal Brook. Secondly, the sequence of north-to-south-oriented dunes create obstacles to further westerly flow. Many <b>watercourses</b> <b>turn</b> at right angles and flow south or north along the dune swales, and in some cases this allows multiple watercourses to coalesce. For example, on reaching the coastal plain, Ellen Brook runs south for around 30 km, picking up a number of <b>watercourses</b> along <b>the</b> way, before finally emptying into the Swan River. Another example is the Serpentine River, which runs west to less than 10 km from the coast, then turns south, running parallel with the coast for nearly 20 km before disgorging into Peel Inlet.|$|R
