25|$|The city {{experiences}} {{the most prominent}} difference among seasons and between temperature extremes among all Brazilian capitals. One <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the highest latitude, which also contributes for the occurrence of 14 hours of daylight in December and 10 hours in June. The population is occasionally dangerously exposed to extremely high UV radiation.|$|E
25|$|Fish {{catchment}} decreased 10 {{times between}} 1989 and 2005. Apart from pollution, another <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> hydraulic and engineering works. For example, {{construction of new}} ports in Ust-Luga and Vysotsk and on Vasilievsky Island adversely affected the spawning of fish. Extraction of sand and gravel in the Neva Bay for the land reclamation destroy spawning sites of European smelt.|$|E
25|$|Currently {{advanced}} tournament {{rock and}} roll dancers don't wear petticoats and jeans - as the original {{rock and roll}} dancers did - but rather multi-coloured costumes that are made of elastic artificial fibre and can only be purchased as individual pieces by special tailors. One <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> that acrobatic elements have grown more and more dangerous, requiring both freedom of movement and enough durability to avoid tearing.|$|E

50|$|After the {{agreement}} of Mraka was reached, Anna Neda her sons were informed {{to go to the}} Bulgarian capital Tarnovo. Ivan Stephen entered the city and was proclaimed emperor {{in the second half of}} August 1330. Although he was in his early 30s, Ivan Stephen ruled together with his mother; the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> unknown.|$|R
30|$|In addition, Galindo (2016) {{emphasizes}} incompleteness of {{the priority}} {{given to the}} principles of sovereignty, equality among States and noninterventionism to guarantee the independence of these countries. The main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the need <b>for</b> change on economic structures - creation of the New International Economic Order (NOEI). The focus was the Nation-State and how the most powerful countries used International Law to maintain their hegemonies.|$|R
25|$|The name of Maodun {{has been}} {{associated}} with Oghuz Khagan, an epic ancestor of the Turkic people. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> a striking similarity of the Oghuz Khagan biography in the Turko manuscripts (Rashid al-Din, Hondemir, Abulgazi) with the Maodun biography in the Chinese sources (feud between the father and son and murder of the former, the direction and sequence of conquests, etc.), which was first noticed by N.Ya. Bichurin (Compilation of reports, pp.56–57).|$|E
25|$|The Hill {{also has}} gone but the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{a little harder}} to pin. Up until the 1990s the Hill was a grassy slope without seating. It was the 'outer ground' costing the least to get in and {{attracting}} working class patronage. The invention of the beer can and the portable cooler in the 1960s increased alcohol consumption at cricket matches which in turn fuelled bad crowd behaviour. In the 1970s the advent of limited overs games held partially at night attracted a different kind of crowd to cricket at the SCG. They were less interested in the subtleties of the game and more in the excitement and spectacle. Brawling and excessive drinking were features of the crowd on the Hill at this time. Even the introduction of individual seating on the Hill failed to completely eradicate crowd misbehaviour. Stricter measures such as banning alcohol were later implemented with greater success.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{technology}} that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. It allows the player {{to be able to}} interact with the game differently than before. The person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. They can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. Another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. Some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. Other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the person can move around in front of it and the actions done are repeated in a character of the game you are playing as.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project examines {{the relationship between}} the financial leverage of firms with total book assets above $ 50 M and the Target Federal Fund Rate changes during 1990 to 2015. We do not find that the value-weighted index is affected by change in interest rates. We find that increases in interest rate tends to hurt firms with higher book leverage (debt divided by total assets) than firms with low leverage. Unfortunately, these results {{do not seem to be}} robust, and we believe <b>that</b> the major <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we use the full interest rate change, rather than the unanticipated component of interest rate change, which is unobservable...|$|R
30|$|Figure 11 (b) shows {{a linear}} {{regression}} {{of the number}} of SpamBands per day for each honeypot. The linear trends reveal lines with low inclination (almost constant) adding to the impression that the variation observed in Figure 11 (a) is regular and is due to some kind of obfuscation. Another interesting result is about honeypot EC- 01. <b>That</b> honeypot <b>was</b> attacked by more SpamBands than any other, although no clear <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> found.|$|R
30|$|However, {{there seemed}} to be no {{consistent}} or substantial differences between the efficiencies of any of the double sampling estimators. The only exception was for model-assisted sampling in example 2 with the smallest second-phase sample size, which was clearly much less efficient than any of the other estimators, although still appreciably more efficient than results obtained using simple random sampling; the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>were</b> discussed earlier and explained through Fig.  2.|$|R
500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of time in filming, no tracks were filmed that were unreleased, but several {{alternative}} shots and outtakes were held in the Archives du Film du Bois D'Arcy near Paris. At some point, an employee of the owners, MHF Productions, decided this footage was of no value and incinerated all 548 cans of the original 35mm negatives. Maben was particularly frustrated about the lack of additional shots for [...] "One of These Days," [...] which is primarily a Mason solo-piece in the released version. Mason recalls the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> that the reel of film featuring the other members was lost attempting to assemble the original cut.|$|E
2500|$|Marxists also {{assumed that}} {{earnings}} from production must be either spent on consumption or reinvested in production, {{but that is}} in reality not the case. [...] Modern financial capitalism has put into question traditional models of causal chains in the economy. The main <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> that there now exists {{a large amount of}} capital in rich countries that is not invested in production, yet strongly influences the developmental pattern of production and consumption.|$|E
2500|$|Note {{that there}} are two choices for : 43000Hz and 47000Hz, called [...] {{low-side}} and high-side injection. With high-side injection, the spectral components that were distributed around 45000Hz will be distributed around 2000Hz in the reverse order, also known as an inverted spectrum. That is in fact desirable when the IF spectrum is also inverted, because the BFO inversion restores the proper relationships. One <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> when the IF spectrum is the output of an inverting stage in the receiver. Another reason is when the SSB signal is actually a lower sideband, instead of an upper sideband. But if both reasons are true, then the IF spectrum is not inverted, and the non-inverting BFO (43000Hz) should be used.|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{internal}} organization of many micro-arthropods with body sizes below 1 mm. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> the small size and the hard cuticle which makes it difficult to use protocols of classical histology. In addition, histological sectioning destroys the sample and can therefore not be used for unique material. Hence, a non-destructive method is desirable which allows to view inside small samples without the need of sectioning...|$|R
50|$|Arab Spring {{events in}} 2011 led to demonstrations in Jordan, and Bedouins {{took part in}} them. But it <b>is</b> {{unlikely}} <b>that</b> the Hashemites <b>are</b> to expect a revolt similar to turbulence in other Arab states. The main <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> the high respect to the monarch, and contradictory interests of different groups of the Jordanian society. The King Abdullah II maintains his distance from the complaints by allowing blame to fall on government ministers, whom he replaces at will.|$|R
30|$|Drop-out rates: MOOCs {{are facing}} high {{drop-out}} rates in average of 95 % of course participants. One {{of the potential}} <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the complexity and diversity of MOOC participants perspectives. This diversity is not only related to the cultural and demographic attributes, but it also considers the diverse motives and perspectives when enrolled in MOOCs. This requires {{an understanding of the}} different patterns of MOOCs participants and their perspectives when participating in MOOCs (Yousef et al. 2015 a).|$|R
2500|$|Like {{the rest}} of Mesoamerica, the basic diet {{has been based on}} corn and Chiapas cooking retains strong {{indigenous}} influence. One important ingredient is chipilin, a fragrant and strongly flavored herb and hoja santa, the large anise-scented leaves used in much of southern Mexican cuisine. [...] Chiapan dishes do not incorporate many chili peppers as part of their dishes. Rather, chili peppers are most often found in the condiments. One <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> that a local chili pepper, called the simojovel, is far too hot to use except very sparingly. Chiapan cuisine tends to rely more on slightly sweet seasonings in their main dishes such as cinnamon, plantains, prunes and pineapple are often found in meat and poultry dishes.|$|E
2500|$|The Simpsons writer Al Jean {{commented that}} Grampa {{is often the}} focus of pointed jokes about old people. He said the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> because the staff is trying to {{illustrate}} how society mistreats the elderly, [...] "and {{some of it is}} because people over 55 never watch our show". Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, former writers on the show, said that they liked to write episodes about Grampa because they are [...] "obsessed" [...] with old people. Weinstein commented that they [...] "both love [...] and seem to really hate them at the same time". He also said that he [...] "enjoys" [...] writing for characters such as Grampa and Mr. Burns because of their [...] "out-datedness", and because he gets to use dictionaries for looking up [...] "old time slang".|$|E
2500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the {{announcement}} of the discovery of Gliese 581g, a team—led by Michael Mayor of the Geneva Observatory— reported that in a new analysis of 179 measurements taken by the HARPS spectrograph over 6.5 years, neither planet g nor planet f was detectable. An astronomer who works on HARPS data at the Geneva Observatory, Francesco Pepe, said in an email for an Astrobiology Magazine article republished on Space.com, [...] "The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> that, despite the extreme accuracy of the instrument and the many data points, the signal amplitude of this potential fifth planet is very low and basically {{at the level of the}} measurement noise". The Geneva team had also published their paper on arXiv, but it appeared to not have been accepted for publication.|$|E
50|$|Devrim {{was never}} mass-produced. One <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> {{the cars were}} crafted prototypes and the {{production}} process was not well-documented, with almost no technical drawings remaining from the production phase. Another reason <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the demand <b>was</b> not high enough to make mass production feasible. Conversely Anadol factory has been founded {{just a few years}} after (1966) and started serial production of passenger vehicles. The founder of Anadol automobile factory Vehbi Koç was a Ford dealer and before the Devrim project, he did not believe <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> possible to produce cars in Turkey.|$|R
2500|$|There is {{an element}} of countenance in many Krishna {{centered}} traditions to the subordination of Krishna to Vishnu. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> given <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> the easiest way to accommodate Krishna's human story within the composite Vaishnava theological perspective. These [...] "core texts assert and defend the ultimacy of Krsna's identity". However inclusion of Krishna in the list of avataras does not necessarily subordinate him to Vishnu as one of the latter's expansions. Early authors, such as 12th century Jayadeva considered dasavatara to be principal incarnations of Krishna, rather than Vishnu.|$|R

30|$|Previous {{studies showed}} that screw {{retention}} methods are equally suitable for the partially edentulous patient, although cement-retained restorations are more frequently used. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> cement-retained crowns {{have more in common}} with regular fixed prosthodontics than do screw-retained restorations and as such have a wider appeal to practitioners of all experience levels (Sherif et al. 2014). Although several studies have proved the reliability and long-term success of these cement-retained restorations, abutment-screw loosening and ultimate screw fracture is a challenging complication in those restorations and may result in masticatory and psychiatric problems to the patient (Chaar et al. 2011).|$|R
