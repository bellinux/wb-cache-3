A hydrophobic microsphere (radius, r 20 – 30 μm) is brought into contact with a small sessile water drop resting on a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) surface. When the microsphere touches the liquid surface, the meniscus rises onto it because of capillary forces.

The sphere is pinned at the interface, whose small (< 100 nm) oscillations are readily measured with AFM. <b>Resonance</b> <b>oscillation</b> frequencies were measured for drop volumes between 5 and 200 μL.

This study evaluates the resonant properties of pacemaker pyloric dilator (PD) neurons in the central pattern generator network through mathematical modeling. From the pharmacological point of view, calcium currents cannot be blocked in PD neurons without removing the calcium-dependent potassium current. Thus, the effects of calcium I Ca and calcium-dependent potassium I KCa currents on resonant properties remain unclear. By taking advantage of Hodgkin-Huxley-type model of neuron and its equivalent RLC circuit, we {{examine the effects of}} changing resting membrane potential and those ionic currents on the resonance. Results show that changing the resting membrane potential influences the amplitude and frequency of resonance so that the strength of resonance (Q-value) increases by both depolarization and hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential. Moreover, hyperpolarization-activated inward current I h and I Ca (in association with I KCa) are dominant factors on resonant properties at hyperpolarized and depolarized potentials, respectively. Through mathematical analysis, results indicate that I h and I KCa affect the resonant properties of PD neurons. However, I Ca only has an amplifying effect on the resonance amplitude of these neurons...|$|E

This work defines {{the consequences of the}} nanoparticle overloading amount and energy transfer process between gold nanorod and polymer (active matrix) in organic solar cells. We have studied the hole population decay dynamics coupled with gold nanorods loading amount which provides better understanding about device performance limiting factors. The exciton and plasmon together act as an interacting dipole; however, the energy exchange between these two has been elucidated via plasmon resonance energy transfer (PRET) mechanism. Further, the charge species have been identified specifically with respect to their energy levels appearing in ultrafast time domain. The specific interaction of these charge species with respective surface plasmon resonance mode, i. e., exciton to transverse mode of oscillation and polaron pair to longitudinal mode of oscillations, has been explained. Thus, our analysis reveals that PRET enhances the carrier population density in polymer via non-radiative process beyond the concurrence of a particular plasmon <b>resonance</b> <b>oscillation</b> mode and polymer absorption range.

The results of waveform inversion show that the initial and later parts {{can be explained by}} a northward single-force of 1. 5 × 10 ^ 8 N working at a depth of 2 km beneath the summit and a moment tensor solution at a depth of 5 km below and 2 km southwest of the summit with ～ 10 ^ 12 Nm, respectively. A clear positive correlation of the amplitudes between the two sources strongly suggests that the shallow single-force triggers the deeper moment source in spite of the several km distance between the two sources. To analyze the source time functions of the moment tensor that do not always oscillate in phase, we introduce a new method of moment tensor diagonalization which is performed in the frequency domain. According to the analysis, the two principal components have similar amplitudes and are greater than the third principal component, suggesting an axially symmetric oscillation. One of the possible systems is a combination of two cracks intersecting perpendicularly. Our interpretation is that the single-force was generated when magma containing rock blocks suddenly began to move in a choked subsurface magma path, and the resultant pressure waves propagated and excited a <b>resonance</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the two cracks...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRotating {{black holes}} can support quasi-stationary (unstable) bound-state {{resonances}} of massive scalar fields in their exterior regions. These spatially regular scalar configurations {{are characterized by}} instability timescales which are much longer than the timescale M set by the geometric size (mass) of the central black hole. It is well-known that, in the small-mass limit α≡Mμ≪ 1 (here μ is {{the mass of the}} scalar field), these quasi-stationary scalar resonances are characterized by the familiar hydrogenic oscillation spectrum: ωR/μ= 1 −α 2 / 2 n¯ 02, where the integer n¯ 0 (l,n;α→ 0) =l+n+ 1 is the principal quantum number of the bound-state resonance (here the integers l= 1, 2, 3,… and n= 0, 1, 2,… are the spheroidal harmonic index and the resonance parameter of the field mode, respectively). As it depends only on the principal resonance parameter n¯ 0, this small-mass (α≪ 1) hydrogenic spectrum is obviously degenerate. In this paper we go beyond the small-mass approximation and analyze the quasi-stationary bound-state resonances of massive scalar fields in rapidly-spinning Kerr black-hole spacetimes in the regime α=O(1). In particular, we derive the non-hydrogenic (and, in general, non-degenerate) <b>resonance</b> <b>oscillation</b> spectrum ωR/μ= 1 −(α/n¯) 2, where n¯(l,n;α) =(l+ 1 / 2) 2 − 2 mα+ 2 α 2 + 1 / 2 +n is the generalized principal quantum number of the quasi-stationary resonances.

40|$|An {{accretion}} flow {{around a}} black hole has a saddle type sonic point just outside the event horizon to guarantee that the flow enters the black hole supersonically. This feature exclusively present in strong gravity limit makes its marks in every observation of black hole candidates. Another physical sonic point is present (as in a Bondi flow) even in weak gravity. Every aspect of spectral or temporal properties of every black hole can be understood using this transonic or advective flow having more than one saddle type points. This most well known and generalized solution with viscosity and radiative transfer has been verified by numerical simulations also. Spectra, computed for various combinations of the standard Keplerian, and advective sub-Keplerian components match accurately with those from satellite observations. Standing, oscillating and propagatory oscillating shocks are produced due to centrifugal barrier of the advective component. The post-shock region acts as the Compton cloud producing the power-law spectra. Jets and outflows are also produced from this post-shock region, {{commonly known as the}} CENtrifugal barrier supported BOundary Layer or CENBOL. In soft states, the CENBOL is cooled down by soft photons from the Keplerian disk, and thus the outflow is absent. Type-C and Type-B QPOs are generated respectively due to strong and weak resonance oscillations of the CENBOL.

40|$|In a two {{component}} advective flow {{around a}} compact object, a high viscosity Keplerian disk {{is flanked by}} a low angular momentum and low viscosity flow which forms a centrifugal pressure supported shock wave close to the black hole. The post-shock region which behaves as a Compton cloud becomes progressively smaller during the outburst as the spectra change from the hard state to the soft state {{in order to satisfy}} Rankine-Hugoniot relation in presence of cooling. The <b>resonance</b> <b>oscillation</b> of the shock wave which causes low frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) also allows us to obtain the shock location from each observed QPO frequency. Applying the theory of transonic flow with Compton cooling and viscosity, we obtain the viscosity parameter α_SK required for the shock to form at those places in the low-Keplerian component. When we compare the evolution of α_SK for each outburst, we arrive at a major conclusion: In each source, the advective flow component typically requires exactly a similar value of α_SK when transiting from one spectral state to another (e. g., from hard state to soft state through intermediate states and the other way around in the declining phase). Most importantly, these α_SK values in the low-angular momentum advective component are fully self-consistent {{in the sense that they}} remain below critical value α_cr required to form a Keplerian disk. For a further consistency check, we compute the α_K of the Keplerian component, and find that in each of the objects, α_SK < α_cr < α_K.
