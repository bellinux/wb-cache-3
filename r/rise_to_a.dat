5|$|Both sexes are {{territorial}} on {{the breeding}} grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas.

5|$|Earlier than Stifel, the 8th century Jain {{mathematician}} Virasena {{is credited}} with a precursor to the binary logarithm. Virasena's concept of ardhacheda {{has been defined as}} the number of times a given number can be divided evenly by two. This definition gives <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> function that coincides with the binary logarithm on the powers of two, but it is different for other integers, giving the 2-adic order rather than the logarithm.|$|E

5|$|In July 1943, a plane {{carrying}} Sikorski {{plunged into}} the sea immediately after takeoff from Gibraltar, killing all on board except the pilot. The exact circumstances of Sikorski's death have been disputed and have given <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of different theories surrounding the crash and his death. Sikorski {{had been the most}} prestigious leader of the Polish exiles, and his death was a severe setback for the Polish cause.|$|E
5|$|New {{concepts}} and mathematical tools provided fresh insights into general relativity, giving <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{period in the}} 1960s–70s {{now known as the}} golden age of general relativity. In the mid-1970s, physicists began studying higher-dimensional theories combining general relativity with supersymmetry, the so-called supergravity theories.|$|E
5|$|Omaha's {{rich history}} in rhythm and blues, and jazz gave <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of {{influential}} bands, including Anna Mae Winburn's Cotton Club Boys and Lloyd Hunter's Seranaders.

Doug Ingle from the late 1960s band Iron Butterfly was born in Omaha, as was indie folk singer-songwriter Elliott Smith, though both were raised elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|Some of the charged {{particles}} do {{get into the}} magnetosphere. These spiral around field lines, bouncing {{back and forth between}} the poles several times per second. In addition, positive ions slowly drift westward and negative ions drift eastward, giving <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ring current. This current reduces the magnetic field at the Earth's surface. Particles that penetrate the ionosphere and collide with the atoms there give rise to the lights of the aurorae and also emit X-rays.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} anurans {{hybridize}} readily. For instance, the edible frog (Pelophylax esculentus) is a hybrid between the pool frog (P. lessonae) and the marsh frog (P. ridibundus). The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata {{are similar in}} forming hybrids. These are less fertile than their parents, giving <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hybrid zone where the hybrids are prevalent.|$|E
5|$|The actual superconducting {{material}} is often written as YBa2Cu3O7–d, where d must {{be less than}} 0.7 for superconductivity. The {{reason for this is}} still not clear, but it is known that the vacancies occur only in certain places in the crystal, the copper oxide planes, and chains, giving <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> peculiar oxidation state of the copper atoms, which somehow leads to the superconducting behavior.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the village {{can be traced to}} the stream which runs through the parish and gave <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of corn mills along its length.

The village contains a number of listed buildings, which include a 12th-century church, an old mill house and two oast houses.|$|E
5|$|The sperm whale's unique body is {{unlikely}} to be confused with any other species. The sperm whale's distinctive shape comes from its very large, block-shaped head, which can be one-quarter to one-third of the animal's length. The S-shaped blowhole is located very close {{to the front of the}} head and shifted to the whale's left. This gives <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> distinctive bushy, forward-angled spray.|$|E

With {{the commencement of}} the Virgin Tour, a wide-ranging audience—especially young women—thronged to attend, attired in Madonna-inspired clothing. This frenzy regarding Madonna gave <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new term called Madonna wannabe—a word that was ultimately officially recognized by the Webster's Dictionary in May 1991.|$|E
5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{geographic}} position, Croatia {{represents a}} blend of four different cultural spheres. It has been a crossroad of influences of the western culture and the east—ever since division of the Western Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire—as {{well as of the}} Mitteleuropa and the Mediterranean culture. The Illyrian movement was the most significant period of national cultural history, as the 19th-century period proved crucial in emancipation of the Croatian language and saw unprecedented developments in all fields of art and culture, giving <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of historical figures.|$|E
