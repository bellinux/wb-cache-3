5|$|In {{terms of}} combat, the game allows players {{to create and}} {{customise}} their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four categories of fighting moves called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time. The Pressen moves are <b>Regen</b> (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous moves) and Cooldown (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen moves will {{be made available to}} the player {{over the course of the}} game: the moves enable them to do things like stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct. Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer and Junk Bolt.|$|E

25|$|Both {{languages}} are still largely mutually intelligible, although this relation can in some fields (such as lexicon, spelling and grammar) be asymmetric, {{as it is}} easier for Dutch speakers to understand written Afrikaans than it is for Afrikaans speakers to understand written Dutch. Afrikaans is grammatically far less complex than Dutch, and vocabulary items are generally altered in a clearly patterned manner, e.g. vogel becomes voël ("bird") and <b>regen</b> becomes reën ("rain"). In South Africa, the number of students following Dutch at university is difficult to estimate, since the academic study of Afrikaans inevitably includes the study of Dutch. Elsewhere in the world, the number of people learning Dutch is relatively small.|$|E

500|$|Greg Rule {{declared}} in 1999, after its temporary disbandment, that KMFDM had [...] "produced nine high-impact records that have earned them a large, loyal fanbase {{strewn across the}} planet." [...] Erlewine called the band [...] "one of Wax Trax's first industrial superstars", [...] "an underground sensation", and [...] "one of the major industrial bands of the '90s." [...] Most of the band's albums released {{in the 21st century}} have been well-received, although Prato and <b>ReGen</b> Magazines Ilker Yücel have commented on the sameness from one album to the next. Recent albums Blitz and WTF?! have been described as moving in an electronic, less guitar-focused direction by Trey Spencer of Sputnikmusic and AllMusic's David Jeffries.|$|E
500|$|Ilker Yücel of <b>ReGen</b> Magazine said [...] "Mythmaker {{certainly}} continues {{along the}} path paved by The Greater Wrong of the Right, representing an embrace of modern electronic music and pushing it to its limits." [...] Discussing individual songs, he said the first track, [...] "Maginifishit", was [...] "a testament to Mark Walk's impressive abilities to use Ogre's voice as an instrument unto itself." [...] Yücel stated that [...] "Jaher" [...] is [...] "full of dark atmosphere {{that is at once}} soothing and nightmarish" [...] and called it [...] "arguably the best track" [...] on the album. [...] He called [...] "Politikil" [...] "a somewhat more rock & roll type of track" [...] with [...] "chugs and churns of overdriven synths and guitar-like tones, and a rocking rhythm" [...] that is [...] "sure to be a highlight when played live". [...] Yücel also said, [...] "Many will still chide the band for not returning to the sound of past successes like Last Rights or Too Dark Park, but it's this type of purist viewpoint that ultimately stagnates a band's progress." ...|$|E
500|$|The cantata {{text was}} {{provided}} by Erdmann Neumeister, published in Geistliche Poesien in Frankfurt in 1714. He began and ended his work with a hymn stanza. [...] "" [...] is the main hymn for Advent, which Martin Luther had derived from the Latin [...] Its melody is based on Medieval chant and supplies a [...] "dark, imposing character". For the conclusion, Neumeister chose the second part, the , of the seventh and final stanza of Philipp Nicolai's [...] "". The librettist quoted the Book of Revelation in the fourth movement: [...] ""– [...] "Behold, I stand {{at the door and}} knock. Anyone that hears My voice and opens the door, to him I will enter and keep the evening meal with him and he with me." [...] (...) [...] The poet combined the ideas of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and his promise to return with an invitation to enter the heart of the individual Christian. He developed his thoughts like a sermon, as the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr notes: mentioning that the arrival of Jesus brings blessing every day (movement 2), a prayer that Jesus may come to his congregation (movement 2), and in response to his statement of being at the door (movement 4) the opening of the heart of the individual Christian who knows about his sinfulness (movement 5). Bach had set one text by Neumeister before, possibly by 1713, in his cantata Gleichwie der <b>Regen</b> und Schnee vom Himmel fällt, BWV 18.|$|E

[...] Ilker Yücel of <b>ReGen</b> Magazine called WTF?! a [...] "hard-hitting dose of industrial rock that is as familiar as it is unusual". [...] He concluded his review by saying, [...] "In short, it’s KMFDM by-the-numbers, and after 27 years, that's not a bad thing at all." [...] Mark von Pfeiffer of Magnetic said, [...] "WTF? is typical: electronic used to augment electric to over-human speeds and volumes, outrageous claims made in the 3rd-person". [...] He also thought the album was more accessible, saying, [...] "This is industrial, but edible for most anyone looking for a bit of roughage on their playlist." [...] Petra Whiteley of Reflections of Darkness called WTF?! [...] "a solid release bursting with power and determination".

2500|$|Entomologists from Ivan <b>Regen</b> onward {{have agreed}} that the {{principal}} purpose of a male cricket's [...] "song" [...] is to attract females for mating. Berthold Laufer and Frank Lutz recognized the fact but noted {{that it was not}} clear why males do it continuously throughout most of their adult lives, when actual mating doesn't take much time. More is known about the attractive mechanism of a cricket's song. Scientists exposed cricket females to synthesized [...] "cricket songs", carefully varying different acoustic parameters, and measured the degree of females' response to different sounds. They found that although each species has its own optimal mating call, the repetition rate of chirp [...] "syllables" [...] was the single most important parameter. A male's singing skills do not guarantee him instant success: other, silent, males may be waiting nearby to intercept the females he attracts. Other males may be attracted by the song and rush to the singer just as females do. When another cricket confronts a singing male, the two insects determine each other's sex by touching their antennae. If it turns out that both crickets are male, the contact leads to a fight. Crickets, and Orthoptera in general, are model organisms for the study of male-male aggression, although females can also be aggressive. According to Judge and Bonanno, the shape and size of male crickets' heads are a direct result of selection through male-male fights.|$|E

6000|$|Surely {{there is}} not another {{language}} that is so slipshod and systemless, and so slippery and elusive to the grasp. One is washed about in it, hither and thither, in the most helpless way; and when at last he thinks he has captured a rule which offers firm ground to take a rest on amid the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech, he turns over the page and reads, [...] "Let the pupil make careful note of the following EXCEPTIONS." [...] He runs his eye down and finds {{that there are more}} exceptions to the rule than instances of it. So overboard he goes again, to hunt for another Ararat and find another quicksand. Such has been, and continues to be, my experience. Every time I think I have got one of these four confusing [...] "cases" [...] where I am master of it, a seemingly insignificant preposition intrudes itself into my sentence, clothed with an awful and unsuspected power, and crumbles the ground from under me. For instance, my book inquires after a certain bird--(it is always inquiring after things which are of no sort of consequence to anybody): [...] "Where is the bird?" [...] Now the answer to this question--according to the book--is that the bird is waiting in the blacksmith shop on account of the rain. Of course no bird would do that, but then you must stick to the book. Very well, I begin to cipher out the German for that answer. I begin at the wrong end, necessarily, for that is the German idea. I say to myself, [...] "REGEN (rain) is masculine--or maybe it is feminine--or possibly neuter--it is too much trouble to look now. Therefore, it is either DER (the) <b>Regen,</b> or DIE (the) <b>Regen,</b> or DAS (the) <b>Regen,</b> according to which gender it {{may turn out to be}} when I look. In the interest of science, I will cipher it out on the hypothesis that it is masculine. Very well--then THE rain is DER <b>Regen,</b> if it is simply in the quiescent state of being MENTIONED, without enlargement or discussion--Nominative case; but if this rain is lying around, in a kind of a general way on the ground, it is then definitely located, it is DOING SOMETHING--that is, RESTING (which is one of the German grammar's ideas of doing something), and this throws the rain into the Dative case, and makes it DEM <b>Regen.</b> However, this rain is not resting, but is doing something ACTIVELY,--it is falling--to interfere with the bird, likely--and this indicates MOVEMENT, which has the effect of sliding it into the Accusative case and changing DEM <b>Regen</b> into DEN Regen." [...] Having completed the grammatical horoscope of this matter, I answer up confidently and state in German that the bird is staying in the blacksmith shop [...] "wegen (on account of) DEN Regen." [...] Then the teacher lets me softly down with the remark that whenever the word [...] "wegen" [...] drops into a sentence, it ALWAYS throws that subject into the GENITIVE case, regardless of consequences--and therefore this bird stayed in the blacksmith shop [...] "wegen DES Regens." ...|$|E
