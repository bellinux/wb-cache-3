40|$|Wireless {{charging}} is {{a popular}} upcoming technology with uses ranging from mobile phone charging through to electric vehicle (EV) charging. Large air gaps found in current EV wireless charging systems (WCS) pose a hurdle of its success. Air gaps in WCS cause issues in regards to efficiency, power transfer and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) leakage issues. A static In-Wheel WCS (IW-WCS) is presented which significantly reduces the issues associated with large air gaps. A small scale laboratory prototype; utilizing a standard 10 mm steel <b>reinforced</b> <b>tyre,</b> has been created and compared to a typical 30 mm air gap. The IW-WCS has been investigated by experimental and finite element method (FEM) based electro-magnetic field simulation methods to validate performanceGriffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the "green" tyre, silica is more and more used as a reinforcing filler in tyre applications. Silica when compared to carbon black, strongly reduces the rolling resistance of a tyre, which in turn leads to a lower fuel consumption of the car. The disadvantage of the use of silica is the mixing problem in introduces. Due to its polar surface, silica is difficult to mix with a hydrocarbon rubber. The solution for this problem lies in the use of a coupling agent, which shields the polar silica surface on one hand and reacts with the rubber matrix on the other hand. The coupling agent most commonly used ofr these applications in industry is bis(triethoxy-silylpropyl) tetrasuphide (TESPT). The reaction of this coupling agent with the silica surface has been extensively studied by different authors. It is now widely accepted, that one silanol group of the coupling agent after hydrolysis reacts with a silanol group on the silica surface in a primary reaction. This primary reaction is followed by a secondary reaction in which the remaining silanol groups of the coupling agent react with silanol groups of neighbouring coupling agents. The reaction of the coupling agent with the rubber matrix however, has not been studied to such an extent as the reaction with the silica surface and is still not completely understood. The objective of the research was to investigate the reaction of the coupling agent with the rubber matrix, in an attempt to better understand the reinforcement mechanism for silica-filled rubbers. The interaction between silica and rubber via the coupling agent was studied using three different coupling agent systems: variations on TESPT, silane-accelerator combinations and thiophosphoryl compounds. Their effects on processing as well as on dynamic mechanical properties were investigated. 1 H NMR relaxation measurements were used to obtain additional information concering the interaction between rubber and silica filler in presence and absence of a coupling agent. The coupling agent systems selected for investigation were synthesised and characterised. Variations of TESPT were easy to synthesise, while the sysntehsis of silane-accelarator combinations and of thiphosphoryl compounds was more complicated. Fortunately, at least one coupling agent for each selected system could be syntehs 8 ised. The influence of these different coupling agent systems on properties of a silica <b>reinforced</b> <b>tyre</b> tread compound was studied. The effect of the sulphur- and carbon chain length of a silane coupling agent showed the importance of the existence of a rubber-reactive functional group in a coupling agent. The length of the sulphur chain of a silane coupling agent like TESPT has a strong influence on the processing behaviour of a silica <b>reinforced</b> <b>tyre</b> tread compound, especially on scorch safety. Decreasing the sulphur rank of TESPT from four to two, results in a better scorch safety and therefore a broader processing window, while final properties are comparable to a TESPT reference compound when correction for the reduced amount of sulphur is applied in the curing package. For a sulphur free coupling agent an increase in the length of the carbon chain improves the processing behaviour. Less energy is consumed during mixing when the length of the carbon chain is increased. The Payne effect, which is comonly interpreted as a measure for filler dispersion, is lower for a sulphur free silane, indicating a better filler dispersion. Mechanical properties however, fail when compared to a TESPT reference compound. When sulphur correction is applied in the curing package the tensile properties improve due to an increase in crosslink density, but remain inferior to TESPT. The fact that a sulphur free silane with an equimolar amount of sulphur added to the curing package, still shows inferior tensile properties, compared to TESPT, can be interpreted as the effect of the absence of a chemical link between silica filler and rubber via the coupling agent. In teh presence of a rubber-reactive group in the form of sulphur built-in into the coupling agent, there is a strong indication of the formation of a rubber-to-filler link via the coupling agent. Triethoxysilylpropylbenzothiazole disulphide (TESBD) was investigated as a compound containing a silane and an accelarator functionality. A silica <b>reinforced</b> <b>tyre</b> tread compound containing TESBD shows a lower Payne effect, thus indicating a better filler dispersion. The accelerator built into TESBD turns out to be too slow to act as an accelerator for the curing reaction, which is also reflected in inferior mechanical properties of the compound containing TESBD when compared to TESPT. A small amount of amine in the form of DPG turns out to be sufficient to release the accelerator part of TESBD, resulting in properties grossly comparable to TESPT. Diisopropylthiophosphoryltriethoxysilylpropyl monosulphide (DIPTESM) was studied as a coupling agent containing a thiophosphoryl group. The Payne-effect of a DIPTESM-containing silica-reinforced tyre tread compound is far inferior to the TESPT reference compound. This high Payne-effect indicates a less pronounced shielding of the silica surface for DIPTESM, resulting in an inferior silica dispersion compared to the TESPT reference, which is also reflected in the mechanical properties. The release of teh thiophosphoryl accelerator part turns out to be not effective enough to result in an appreciable corsslinking density. Addition of an extra amount of accelerator is still necessary in order to obtain properties comparable to the TESPT reference. The indication above that a rubber-to-filler link is formed via the coupling agent is based on differences in mechanical properties, but could still not be convincingly proven with the techniques applied there. 1 H_NMR T 2 relaxation, which {{has proved to be a}} successful technique for the study of rubber-filler interactions, was therefore used to investigate interactions between Natural Rubber (NR) and pure as well as grafted silica. Different amounts of immobilised NR were found, depending on grafting material on the silica and grafting density. Based on the results described above a lower amount of immoblised NR was expected for a grafting material without a rubber-reactive group, propyltriethoxy silane (PTES). Indeed, using 1 H NMR relaxation measurements, a lower proportion of immobilised NR is found for the PTES-grafted silica. A highter proportion of immobilised NR is measured for the silane-accelerator combination TESBD when compared to TESPT, by 1 H NMR relaxation. The better overall properties of the silane-accelerator combination TESBD compared to TESPT can be interpreted as the result of a higher affinity of TESBD towards the rubber matrix when compared to TESPT. This then explains the higher amount of immobilised NR found for TESBD-grafted silica, when compared to the TESPT-grafted silica. The results of 1 H NMR relaxation point towards the formation of a strong physical or chemical network around the silica surface. Based on the 1 H NMR relaxation measurements no conclusion can be drawn either whether the network is physical or chemical in nature. The effects of the different silane coupling agents investigated, indicate the formation of a chemical network. Admittedly, all techniques add more or less evidence and none of them is fully conclusive. Combining all results gathered it may be stated that they all point to a chemical rather than a physical bond of the coupling agent to the rubber molecule, whereby it forms a chemical bridge between the polar silica and apolar rubber...|$|E

40|$|Recently, tyre-reinforced {{unsealed}} pavements {{had been}} constructed {{in a number}} of sites throughout Australia. The use of partially cut-up waste tyres within the base layer was expected to produce (i) less lateral movement of base aggregate; (ii) increase in modulus through confinement; (iii) improved vertical stress distribution on the subgrade due to increased base modulus or slab action and (iv) reduced shearing {{in the top of the}} subgrade. This paper presents the results of preliminary study to confirm these expectations through experimental testing and finite element analyses. In the experimental testing, a box test was used to investigate the performance of a model unsealed pavement, <b>reinforced</b> with a <b>tyre.</b> Surface and subsurface measurements indicate that the tyre and base aggregate worked together and acted as a flexible foundation. Finite element analysis confirms that tyre reinforcements help reduce the subgrade vertical pressure which provides a lucrative alternate <b>tyre</b> <b>reinforced</b> pavements that can be constructed over soft subgrades...|$|R

40|$|Two wastes {{from the}} tyre {{recycling}} industry - the fibers used as <b>reinforcing</b> material and <b>tyre</b> crumbs - were pyrolyzed in two ovens of different configuration. Blends {{with a low}} rank coal and a bituminous waste were also prepared to modify {{the composition of the}} oils obtained from the pyrolysis of the tyre wastes. Elemental analysis, calorific value, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and gas chromatography were used to determine the oil composition. A comparative study taking into account the configurations of the ovens and the raw materials was carried out. The oils produced in the rotary oven were found to be more aromatic and to have lower oxygen contents. Depending on the type of oven and the material used in the co-pyrolysis process it is possible to obtain a fuel-oil with a specific heating value and sulfur content. It is also possible to obtain oil with more than 20 % limonene and 20 % BTX (benzene, toluene, xylene). The amount of aliphatics can be increased by including a coal in the pyrolysis process and the amount of aromatics can be increased by co-pyrolysis with a bituminous waste. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Abstract: The {{disposal}} of waste tyres has facing major problems in India. The growing problem of waste tyre disposal in the India can be alleviated if new recycling routes can be found for the surplus tyres. It is estimated that 1. 2 billions of waste tyre rubber produced globally in a year. It is estimated that 11 % of postconsumer tyres are exported and 27 % are sent to landfill, stockpiled or dumped illegally and only 4 % is used for civil engineering projects. Hence efforts {{have been taken to}} identify the potential application of waste tyres in civil engineering projects. In this essence, our present study aims to study the use of waste tyre rubber as tension reinforcement in beam. 6 numbers of beams were cast 3 of them are 10 mm x 15 mm flat size scrap tyre rubber as reinforcement instead of steel in tension zone and other with conventional steel. The experiments were carried out to determine flexural behavior of waste <b>tyre</b> <b>reinforced</b> concrete beam on 28 days.

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{importance}} of the texture and surface chemistry of waste tyre activated carbons in the adsorption of commercial dyes. The adsorption of two commercial dyes, Basic Astrazon Yellow 7 GLL and Reactive Rifafix Red 3 BN on activated carbons made up of <b>reinforcing</b> fibres from <b>tyre</b> waste and low-rank bituminous coal was studied. The surface chemistry of activated carbons was modified by means of HCl-HNO 3 treatment in order {{to increase the number of}} functional groups. Moreover, the influence of the pH on the process was also studied, this factor being of great importance due to the amphoteric characteristics of activated carbons. The activated carbons made with reinforcing fibre and coal had the highest SBET, but the reinforcing fibre activated carbon samples had the highest mesopore volume. The texture of the activated carbons was not modified upon acid oxidation treatment, unlike their surface chemistry which underwent considerable modification. The activated carbons made with a mixture of reinforcing fibre and coal experienced the largest degree of oxidation, and so had more acid surface groups. The adsorption of reactive dye was governed by the mesoporous volume, whilst surface chemistry played only a secondary role. However, the surface chemistry of the activated carbons and dispersive interactions played a key role in the adsorption of the basic dye. The adsorption of the reactive dye was more favored in a solution of pH 2, whereas the basic dye was adsorbed more easily in a solution of pH 12...|$|R
