25|$|He {{did so in}} a field next to the old {{road that}} led to Pitești. Maluțan then told his four {{passengers}} {{that he could do}} nothing more. The Securitate men ran to the roadside and began to flag down passing cars. Two cars stopped, one of them driven by a forestry official and one a red Dacia driven by a local doctor. However, the doctor was not happy about getting involved and, after a short time driving the Ceaușescus, faked engine trouble. A car of a bicycle <b>repair</b> <b>man</b> was then flagged down and he took them to Târgoviște. The driver of the car, Nicolae Petrișor, convinced them that they could hide successfully in an agricultural technical institute on the edge of town. When they arrived, the director guided the Ceaușescus into a room and then locked them in. They were arrested by local police at about 15:30, then after some wandering around transported to the Târgoviște garrison's military compound and held captive for several days until their trial.|$|E
25|$|Seven {{crew members}} and a pilot from Hanko {{lost their lives}} in the accident. Due to the {{extensive}} damage suffered by the pusher only two bodies were found and recovered during the initial dives into the capsized vessel in early January — the first engineer was found in the crushed office and the chief steward in the staircase. After the combination had been rightened on 1 February, the purser was found in the shower room of his own cabin and the electrician in a spare cabin next to the mess hall. When the detached parts of the superstructure were recovered for official investigation in late February, the body of the first mate was found in the remains of the machinery room located below the bridge. The search for the missing victims continued until July 1991 mainly by the Finnish Navy and a tourist submarine chartered to the investigation board. The bodies of the captain and the pilot, who were at the bridge when Finn-Baltic capsized, were found along the drifting path in May and June, respectively. The body of the deck <b>repair</b> <b>man</b> was never recovered.|$|E

2500|$|Ernestine was a nosy, condescending {{telephone}} operator who generally treated customers with little sympathy. Ernestine often snorted when she let loose a barbed response or heard something salacious; she also wore {{her hair in}} a 1940s hairstyle with a hairnet, although the character was contemporary. Her opening lines were often the comical [...] "one ringy dingy... two ringy dingy", and, [...] "is this the party to whom I am speaking?" [...] In the sketches, Ernestine was usually at her switchboard taking calls. She occasionally called her boyfriend, Vito, a telephone <b>repair</b> <b>man,</b> or her pal Phoenicia, another operator.

A reasonably hilarious product of the wise-crack school, it is fast and hearty without setting any new records for wit.

50|$|Some {{philosophers}} entirely reject {{any notion}} of localization of function and thus believe fMRI studies to be profoundly misguided. These philosophers maintain that brain processing acts holistically, that large sections of the brain are involved in processing most cognitive tasks (see holism in neurology and the modularity section below). One way to understand their objection {{to the idea of}} localization of function is the radio <b>repair</b> <b>man</b> thought experiment. In this thought experiment, a radio <b>repair</b> <b>man</b> opens up a radio and rips out a tube. The radio begins whistling loudly and the radio <b>repair</b> <b>man</b> declares that he must have ripped out the anti-whistling tube. There is not really any anti-whistling tube in the radio and {{it is obvious that the}} radio <b>repair</b> <b>man</b> has confounded function with effect. This criticism was originally targeted at the logic used by neuropsychological brain lesion experiments, but the criticism is still applicable to neuroimaging. These considerations are similar to Van Orden's and Paap's criticism of circularity in neuroimaging logic. According to them, neuroimagers assume that their theory of cognitive component parcellation is correct and that these components divide cleanly into feed-forward modules. These assumptions are necessary to justify their inference of brain localization. The logic is circular if the researcher then use the appearance of brain region activation as proof of the correctness of their cognitive theories.|$|E

Then algorithms are sought for an assignment matrix, X - ||x ij ||, which minimizes ∑ i,j x ij dij, under certain constraints, where x ij is the number of persons of skill type i assigned to jobs of skill type j. An input to the problem, then is a determination, for a given organization, of the occupational categories, j - 1, [...] ., s, to which personnel will be assigned. This paper applies the problem to a repair organization.
