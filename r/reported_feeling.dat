5|$|Afterwards, local townspeople went to {{see what}} happened, and 100 to 200 people who got near to the {{meteorite}} crater soon <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> sick. First responding police officers arriving to investigate the scene also fell ill. After the initial event of September 15, {{the number of people}} falling ill increased, requiring physicians to establish auxiliary medical tents for the Carancas health center. Patients were treated for dermal injuries, nausea, headaches, diarrhea and vomiting. The death of nearby livestock was also reported. Locals made the decision to stop drinking from nearby water sources for fear of contamination and authorities considered declaring a state of emergency. Four days after the meteorite impact and the unexplained illness, most villagers reported having recovered.|$|E
50|$|When {{following}} a low carbohydrate diet, {{for the first}} few days, there is an adaptation period during which most people <b>report</b> <b>feeling</b> run-down or tired. Some people <b>report</b> <b>feeling</b> irritable, out of sorts, and unable to make decisions. For most people these feelings disappear after the adaptation period, however, and are replaced with feelings of calm and balance, and more consistent energy.|$|R

5|$|In Martinsburg, West Virginia, several {{government}} buildings were evacuated, and multiple citizens <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> their homes shaking violently enough to rattle picture frames off the walls. In Charleston, the Kanawha County Courthouse, the West Virginia State Capitol campus, {{and several other}} downtown buildings were evacuated; Kanawha County dispatchers received more than 350 telephone calls in 45 minutes, but there were not any reports of damage to buildings and infrastructure other than minor plaster cracking in the old courthouse. In Philippi, part of a chimney collapsed at the Barbour County courthouse. The West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training stated that West Virginia coal mines were safe following the tremors. A roof collapse in Patriot Coal Company's Big Mountain Complex forced {{the closure of the}} mine.|$|E

25|$|According to UNICEF, 82% of {{children}} in Somalia in 2006 <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> safe in their neighborhoods during the day. 13% felt rather safe, 4% indicated that they don't know/it depends, while 0% <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> unsafe. With regard to night-time safety, 53% {{of children}} <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> safe in their neighborhoods, with 25% feeling rather safe, 4% indicating that they feel rather unsafe, 1% reporting that they feel very unsafe, while 16% stated that they don't know/it depends. Regarding incidences of violence among family/friends and against children, 72% of urban children reported no such incidents, whereas 20% responded affirmatively. 90% {{of children in}}dicated that they were not themselves the victims of violence, while 10% reported that they were.

30|$|First, {{we report}} student {{responses}} for {{sense of belonging}} in their STEM major by gender, race, and representation of demographic group in their STEM major. Students frequently gave multiple reasons for belonging or not belonging. Therefore, students’ overall belonging status was coded as follows: (1) belongs in STEM (positive belonging status, only <b>reported</b> <b>feelings</b> of belonging), or (2) does not belong in STEM (negative belonging status, only <b>reported</b> <b>feelings</b> of not belonging), or (3) mixed (<b>reported</b> both <b>feelings</b> of belonging and not belonging). This scheme permitted us to code all students uniquely {{into one of the}} three categories. All statistical results were determined using a test of proportions described above.|$|R

25|$|A reanalysis of the AAUW data {{found that}} {{victims of sexual}} {{harassment}} by teachers reported experiencing adverse health effects because of the abuse. 28% {{said that they had}} trouble sleeping and lost their appetite, 51% <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> embarrassed, and 37% indicated that they felt less sure of themselves or less confident {{as a result of the}} sexual harassment. Furthermore, 36% of the students said that they were afraid or scared and 29% <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> confused about their identity. In addition to negatively affecting health outcomes, teacher sexual abuse influenced the victims' academic performance. The affected students avoided the teacher (43%), they did not want to go to school (36%), avoided talking in class (34%), had trouble paying attention (31%), cut classes (29%), or found it hard to study (29%).|$|E
25|$|A {{survey by}} the Iitate local {{government}} obtained responses from approximately 1,743 evacuees within the evacuation zone. The survey showed that many residents are experiencing growing frustration, instability, and an inability {{to return to their}} earlier lives. Sixty percent of respondents stated that their health and the health of their families had deteriorated after evacuating, while 39.9% <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> more irritated compared to before the disaster.|$|E
25|$|Singing is {{beneficial}} for pregnant mothers. By giving them another medium {{of communication with}} their newborns, mothers in one study reported feelings of love and affection when singing to their unborn children. They also <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> more relaxed than ever before during their stressful pregnancy. A song can have nostalgic significance by reminding a singer of the past, and momentarily transport them, allowing them to focus on singing and embrace the activity as an escape from their daily lives and problems.|$|E

40|$|A safe {{environment}} {{is a prerequisite}} for productive learning. Previous research finds that student fear decreases engagement and achievement, although most studies rely on small samples. This paper represents the first large-scale analysis of how feelings of safety at school affect educational outcomes. Using a unique longitudinal dataset of survey responses from more than 80 percent of New York City middle school students and a variety of econometric methods, this paper provides insight into the causal relationship between feelings of safety and academic achievement. The survey data include the <b>reported</b> <b>feelings</b> for safety of more than 340, 000 students annually from 2007 - 2010 in over 700 middle schools. Findings show consistent negative effects of <b>reporting</b> <b>feeling</b> unsafe on test scores. This paper explores the mechanisms through which feeling unsafe in the classroom may impact test scores and multiple robustness checks strengthen the validity of the causal claim. Minority {{students are more likely to}} <b>report</b> <b>feeling</b> unsafe at school, suggesting that school safety may be a contributing factor to racial and ethnic achievement gaps...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S. W.) 				 California State University, Los Angeles, 2012 Committee members: Valentine Villa, Anh-Luu Huynh-Hohnbaum, Dale WeaverAdolescent, Gender, Healthcare, Latino, Mental Health, SocioeconomicThe {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} {{relationship}} between access to healthcare, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity and the mental health status of adolescents who participated in the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) 2007. The results of the study indicate that feelings of hopelessness, depression, and worthlessness were more likely to be reported by adolescents who do not have a usual place to go to when sick or needing health advice, live in poverty, and are female. Also, adolescent females in this study were more likely to <b>report</b> <b>feeling</b> nervous; however, males were more likely to disclose feeling that everything is an effort. Latino adolescents were more likely to <b>report</b> <b>feeling</b> depressed and that everything is an effort, while Non-Hispanic White adolescents were more likely to <b>report</b> <b>feeling</b> restless. Being insured and adult educational attainment did not have a significant impact on the mental health of this adolescent population...|$|R
25|$|Some African American {{students}} have <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> that their self-esteem {{has been raised}} by the class. However, some students feel that the class has shortcomings; they {{say that it is}} pretty similar to a typical US history course, and that critical conversations about race are generally absent from class. The class does not always relate the topics of the course to issues related to race and racism that are present today. Some students praise the course because it adds representation in an otherwise fairly Euro-centric curriculum.|$|E
25|$|A {{survey by}} the Iitate, Fukushima local {{government}} obtained responses from approximately 1,743 people who have evacuated from the village, which lies within the emergency evacuation zone around the crippled Fukushima Daiichi Plant. It shows that many residents are experiencing growing frustration and instability due to the nuclear crisis and an inability {{to return to the}} lives they were living before the disaster. Sixty percent of respondents stated that their health and the health of their families had deteriorated after evacuating, while 39.9% <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> more irritated compared to before the disaster.|$|E
25|$|A {{very small}} {{preliminary}} {{study published in}} 2016 shows that prayer helps people who have achieved sobriety in Alcoholics Anonymous reduce cravings for alcohol. The study used a MRI machine to scan how subjects reacted to images of people drinking. The study randomly assigned the subjects, so that some subjects saw the images after saying prayers in the Big Book of Alcoholics Anonymous; others after reading newspaper articles. The people who had just seen the prayers <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> fewer cravings for alcohol; the MRI scans of their brains confirmed {{that there was a}} different reaction.|$|E

25|$|O’Sullivan and {{her colleagues}} {{assessed}} 180 girls {{between the ages of}} 12 and 14 on their perceptions on what their first sexual encounters would be like; many girls <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> negative emotions towards sex before their first time. The researchers think this is because adolescent girls are taught that society views adolescent pre-marital sex in negative terms. When they reported positive feelings, the most commonly listed one was feeling attractive. This shows how many girls objectify their own bodies and often think about this before they think of their own sexual desires and needs.|$|E
25|$|Results {{from these}} {{laboratory}} {{studies indicate that}} multiple consecutive sleep episodes of 4 or 6 hours significantly erode performance on the PVT and on measures of working memory, and that performance under these two conditions (i.e., 4 or 6 hours) was comparable to the performance that is found under conditions of 1 to 2 days of total sleep deprivation. Surprisingly, {{by the end of}} the 14 days of sleep restriction, subjects in the 4- and 6-hour sleep period conditions <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> only slightly sleepy. As these reports were taken when performance was at its lowest level, this indicates that the subjects may no longer have been aware of their performance deficits because of inadequate recovery sleep (figure 3-2).|$|E
25|$|One {{study from}} 1996 {{documented}} the interviews {{of a sample}} of junior {{high school students in}} the United States. The girls were less likely to state that they ever had sex than adolescent boys. Among boys and girls who had experienced sexual intercourse, the proportion of girls and boys who had recently had sex and were regularly sexually active was the same. Those conducting the study speculated that fewer girls say they have ever had sex because girls viewed teenage parenthood as more of a problem than boys. Girls were thought to be more restricted in their sexual attitudes; they were more likely than boys to believe that {{they would be able to}} control their sexual urges. Girls had a more negative association in how being sexually active could affect their future goals. In general, girls said they felt less pressure from peers to begin having sex, while boys <b>reported</b> <b>feeling</b> more pressure.|$|E
