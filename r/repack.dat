Four RAAF C-130s transported the company group and its equipment that morning, though loading the aircraft took longer than expected due to a shortage of pallets and specialist loading staff. Once at Norfolk Island, the company group had to <b>repack</b> its equipment into smaller containers, as those originally used could not be carried by the Navy's Wessex helicopters. These helicopters transferred the Army force onto Tobruk during the night, which was dangerous as they were not equipped for night flying. The soldiers were not familiar with the ship, and the process of unpacking and storing their equipment was also slow.|$|E

2500|$|Coaster brakes {{have the}} {{advantage}} of being protected from the elements and thus perform well in rain or snow. Though coaster brakes generally go years without needing maintenance, they are more complicated than rim brakes to repair if it becomes necessary, especially the more sophisticated type with expanding brake shoes. Coaster brakes also do not have sufficient heat dissipation for use on long descents, a characteristic made legendary through events such as the 'Repack Downhill' race, where riders almost certainly would need to <b>repack</b> their coaster brakes after the grease melted or smoked due to the heat from lengthy downhill runs. A coaster brake can only be applied when the cranks are reasonably level, limiting how quickly it can be applied. As coaster brakes are only made for rear wheels, they have the disadvantage common to all rear brakes of skidding the wheel easily. This disadvantage may, however, be alleviated if the bicycle also has a hand-lever-operated front brake and the cyclist uses it. Another disadvantage is that the coaster brake is completely dependent on the chain being fully intact and engaged. If the chain breaks or disengages from the chainwheel and/or rear sprocket, the coaster brake provides no braking power whatsoever. [...] Like all hub brakes except disc brakes, a coaster brake requires a reaction arm to be connected to the frame. [...] This may require unbolting when the wheel is removed or moved in its fork ends to adjust chain tension.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} Seventies, {{two groups of}} enthusiasts: the Larkspur Canyon Gang, from Larkspur (long-time speed-riders down Mount Tamalpais), and later members of Velo-Club Tamalpais from Fairfax and San Anselmo in Marin County, California began group rides in the canyons and over ridges, {{up and down the}} fireroads around Mount Tamalpais, later racing bikes {{downhill}} in a race they called [...] "Repack" [...] because the ride was so grueling that riders had to <b>repack</b> their coaster brakes with grease after each run. The off-road terrain was rocky and the steep mountainside helped riders attain high speeds as they bounced and slammed over rocks and mud. Such harsh treatment caused regular road bikes to crumble, so the racers searched for a more durable and affordable alternative. They soon discovered that old balloon-tired [...] "clunkers" [...] (as they called them) could be had for $5.00 at a garage sale and would endure tremendous punishment. Soon, riders were snapping up these old cruisers, stripping off the heavy fenders and trim, and souped them up to improve downhill performance. Derailleur gears were added by Russ Mahon of [...] The Morrow Dirt Club in Cupertino at the 1974 Marin County cyclo-cross and Gary Fisher's 1975 used a tandem rear hub (from a flea market) with internal steel drum brake and threaded for a freewheel derailleur cluster to his old Schwinn Excelsior bike, enabling him to ride up the mountain, as well as down. About the same time, another rider named Joe Breeze began tinkering with his own Schwinn Excelsior, making it more suited to the [...] "Repack" [...] course. Soon, both of them began to build and sell custom mountain bikes to fellow enthusiasts, launching a worldwide cycling phenomenon.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{experiment}} with practical algorithms for the vector <b>repacking</b> problem and its vari-ants. Vector <b>repacking,</b> like vector packing, aims {{to pack a}} set of input vectors such {{that the number of}} bins used is minimized, while minimizing the changes from the previous packing. We also consider a variant of vector <b>repacking</b> that stores additional copies of items with the goal of improving the performance of vector <b>repacking</b> algorithms. In addition, our algorithms are parameterized {{so that they can be}} effectively optimized for a variety of resource allocation applications with different input characteristics and different cost functions.

60|$|It {{was hard}} then {{not to be}} frantic in her efforts. As it was, she packed her stuff so loosely on the {{planking}} {{that she had to}} <b>repack</b> it, and she started without putting on her snowshoes, and floundered fifty yards before she discovered that omission. The snow was now falling fast, darkling the sky and hiding everything but objects close at hand, and she had to use all her wits to determine her direction; she knew she must go down a long slope and then up to the ridge, and it came to her as a happy inspiration that if she bore to the left she might strike some recognizable vestige of her morning's trail. She had read of people walking in circles when they have no light or guidance, and that troubled her until she bethought herself of the little compass on her watch chain. By that she kept her direction. She wished very much she had timed herself across the waste, so that she could tell when she approached the ridge.|$|E
60|$|Next {{in order}} of events, as we rode up the winding trail through the spruce forest, we met Teague's cow and calf, which he had kept all summer in camp. For some reason neither could be left. Teague told us to ride on, and an hour later when we halted {{to rest on the}} Flattop Mountain he came {{along with the rest of}} the train, and in the fore was the cow alone. It was evident that she was distressed and angry, for it took two men to keep her in the trail. And another thing plain to me was the fact that she was going to demoralize the pack horses. We were not across the wide range of this flat {{mountain}} when one of the pack animals, a lean and lanky sorrel, appeared suddenly to go mad, and began to buck off a pack. He succeeded. This inspired a black horse, very appropriately christened Nigger, to try his luck, and he shifted his pack in short order. It took patience, time, and effort to <b>repack.</b> The cow was a disorganizer. She took up as wide a trail as a road. And the pack animals, some with dignity and others with disgust, tried to avoid her vicinity. Going down the steep forest trail on the other side the real trouble began. The pack train split, ran and bolted, crashing through the trees, plunging down steep places, and jumping logs. It was a wild sort of chase. But luckily the packs remained intact until we were once more on open, flat ground. All went well for a while, except for an accident for which I was to blame. I spurred my horse, and he plunged suddenly past R.C.'s mount, colliding with him, tearing off my stirrup, and spraining R.C.'s ankle. This was almost a serious accident, as R.C. has an old baseball ankle that required favoring.|$|E

The equilibrium stability of the <b>repacked</b> proteins to thermal denaturation is enhanced relative to that of the wild-type protein. The rate of chemically induced folding and unfolding of wild-type Rop is extremely slow when compared with other small proteins. Interestingly, although the <b>repacked</b> proteins are more thermally stable than the wild type, their rates of chemically induced folding and unfolding are greatly increased in comparison to wild type. Perhaps as a consequence of this, their equilibrium stabilities to chemical denaturants are slightly reduced in comparison to the wild type...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} radio channel {{assignment}} scheme called <b>repacking</b> on demand (RoD) for two-tier wireless local loop (WLL) networks. A two-tier WLL overlays a macrocell with several microcells. When a new call {{arrives at a}} two-tier WLL with RoD, if no idle channel is available in both the microcell and the macrocell, <b>repacking</b> is performed (i. e., a call in the macrocell is moved to its corresponding microcell), and then the reclaimed macrocell channel is used to serve the new call. An analytic model is proposed to compute the call blocking probability of the two-tier WLL with <b>repacking.</b> This analytic model is validated against simulation experiments. We prove that the blocking probability is not aected by the call holding time distributions, but is only dependent on {{the mean of the}} call holding times. Compared with some previous proposed schemes, RoD has low blocking probability and signi cantly reduces <b>repacking</b> rate...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} the relaxed online strip packing problem, where rectangular items arrive online {{and have to}} be packed into a strip of fixed width such that the packing height is minimized. Thereby, <b>repacking</b> of previously packed items is allowed. The amount of <b>repacking</b> is measured by the migration factor, defined as the total size of <b>repacked</b> items divided {{by the size of the}} arriving item. First, we show that no algorithm with constant migration factor can produce solutions with asymptotic ratio better than 4 / 3. Against this background, we allow amortized migration, i. e. to save migration for a later time step. As a main result, we present an AFPTAS with asymptotic ratio 1 + O(epsilon) for any epsilon > 0 and amortized migration factor polynomial in 1 /epsilon. To our best knowledge, this is the first algorithm for online strip packing considered in a <b>repacking</b> model...|$|R
