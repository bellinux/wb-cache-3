25|$|The Saltash to St Germans {{section was}} {{by-passed}} by a deviation somewhat inland, and this deviation was opened for goods trains on 23 March 1908 and for passenger trains on 19 May; the former <b>route</b> <b>section</b> was then closed and abandoned. This left only the Royal Albert Bridge {{as the only}} single line section on the main line to Truro (Penwithers Junction). The Falmouth branch was never doubled.|$|E

25|$|The N11 {{commenced}} {{where it}} met the N4 {{on the south}} end of O'Connell Bridge in Dublin city centre. The route proceeded along D'Olier Street, College Street (and in the opposite direction, Westmoreland Street). The route continued around College Green and Grafton Street (and in the other direction, Suffolk Street, Church Lane and Dame Street). From here, the route continued out of the city via Nassau Street, Kildare Street, North side of St. Stephen's Green, Merrion Row, Baggot Street Lower, Pembroke Street Lower, Fitzwilliam Square West and Pembroke Street Upper. This <b>route</b> <b>section</b> in the other direction (into the city centre) ran via Leeson Street Lower, East and North sides of St. Stephen's Green and Dawson Street. The N11 ran in both directions along Leeson Street Lower after the junction with Pembroke Street. Having crossed the Grand Canal the route divided again for a portion of Leeson Street Upper, with outbound traffic proceeding via Sussex Road. The route continued via Morehampton Road and Donnybrook Road, through Donnybrook, with the route becoming dual carriageway at Donnybrook Church, which marks the beginning of the Stillorgan Road.|$|E

40|$|Car drivers' {{spontaneous}} speed {{choice in}} urban areas was studied and compared with posted speed limits. Two groups of middle-aged men, experienced car drivers, participated in the study. One group consisted of thirteen drivers with {{at least five years}} experience of car driving in Linköping. The other group consisted of eight drivers with very little experience of car driving in Linköping. The participants drove a pre-determined test route in the city of Linköping four times with covered speedometer. The total driving distance was 96 km. The participants were alone in the car during driving. Route guidance was given during the drive, both verbally and visually. The location and timing of the guidance were controlled by a GPS-based computer. Before the test drive the participants were instructed to drive as they normally do without stress. The participants' speed (75 th percentile) for each of the <b>route</b> <b>sections</b> and {{for each of the four}} drives was measured and analysed. After completion of the test the participants rated some of the <b>route</b> <b>sections.</b> The measured speed varied substantially between <b>route</b> <b>sections</b> (traffic environments). However, the agreement between measured speeds across <b>route</b> <b>sections</b> was large between as well as within individuals. Along some <b>route</b> <b>sections</b> the speed was higher, and along others it was lower, than the posted speed limit. The speed variation across traffic environments (<b>route</b> <b>sections)</b> can to a large extent be explained by the variation between the traffic environments and to a much less extent by the variation between participants...|$|R

500|$|The {{construction}} of the A8 motorway (and the Istrian Y as a whole) has its origin in 1968, when the Croatian Parliament endorsed a petition by Istrian legislators for the {{construction of}} a modern road between the peninsula and the rest of Croatia.
