40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of technology based development cooperation, and a story on how technology can include and/or exclude social groups in society, in this case people with disabilities. The focus is on wheelchair aid and provision of assistive devices in developing countries. The travels of a wheelchair and wheelchair technology from a Western country to a developing country are described and analyzed by using the concepts and dimensions of technography. The thesis treats the contextual embeddedness of a technology and the problems that may arise when the technology is transferred to a new environment with new actors to interact with. The main example is a wheelchair aid project called the Local <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>Workshop</b> (LOREWO) in Oshakati, Namibia. LOREWO is run by and {{for people with disabilities}} by repairing, assembling and producing wheelchairs. In describing LOREWO the focus of the thesis is on co-production, exchange and accumulation of knowledge within the project. Later the thesis discusses what kind of opportunities the users experience in their reconfiguration with the wheelchair and what hindrances the wheelchair users face in the interaction between the user, the wheelchair and the surroundings...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem with}} which {{this study is}} {{concerned}} is the separation of rehabilitation from production costs in vocational <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>workshops.</b> Within workshops there are those functions and tasks—testing, counseling, and the administration thereof—which clearly are rehabili-tative. The costs of these activities, therefore, are solely rehabilitation costs. In the production area of workshop operations, however, where production and rehabilitation efforts are intertwined, two kinds of costs are incurred simultaneously: (l) rehabilitation or training costs and (2) production costs. As yet, no generally accepted procedures exist for separating these joint costs. There are several sources of data available {{for use in the}} study.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a BCI control {{approach}} for the assis-tive robotic system FRIEND is presented. The {{objective of the}} robot is to assist elderly and persons with disabilities in their daily and professional life activities. FRIEND is presented here from an architectural point of view, that is, as an overall robotic device which includes many subareas of research, such as human-robot interaction, perception, object manipulation and path planning, robotic safety, etc. The integration of the hardware and software components is described relative to the interconnections between the various elements of FRIEND and the approach used for human-machine interaction. Since the robotic system {{is intended to be}} used especially by patients suffering from a high degree of disability (e. g. patients which are quadriplegic, have muscle diseases or serious paralysis due to strokes or many more other diseases with similar consequences for their independence), an alternative non-invasive Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has been investigated. The FRIEND-BCI paradigm is explained within the overall structure of the robot. The capabilities of the robotic system are demonstrated in three support scenarios, one that deals with Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and two that are taking place in a <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>workshop.</b> The proposed robot was clinically evaluated through different tests that directly measure task execution time and hardware performance, as well as the acceptance of the robot by the end-users.

In this follow-up workshop, {{we would like to}} take the next step, shifting from discussing the philosophical underpinnings we draw upon to explain and substantiate our practice, to form our own interaction design theory and conceptualisations. We propose that soma-based design theory needs practical, pragmatic as well as analytical study - otherwise the felt dimension will be missing. We will consider how such tacit knowledge can be articulated, documented and shared. To ground the discussion firmly in the felt experience of our own practice, the workshop is organised as a joint practical design work session, supported by analytical study...|$|R
50|$|The worst {{breach of}} prison {{security}} {{in a decade}} began when the three prisoners took an old Toyota four-wheel-drive and a Nissan sedan from two workshops inside the prison about 1.50pm on Monday. The cars were being repaired by prisoners {{as part of their}} <b>rehabilitation</b> and skills <b>workshops.</b> The escapees crashed through two doors where vehicles enter and exit the prison site. With the four-wheel-drive leading, the three men made it to a perimeter area outside the main compound but still had one big fence between them and freedom. The two cars gathered speed in the perimeter area, which is overseen by guards in towers. The cars veered away from a concrete wall and steered towards a metal fence lashed with razor wire, smashing into it at between 60 and 70 km/h. But the wire fence held firm and acted like a net, trapping the four-wheel-drive. The sedan then crashed into the back of it. The prisoners found a gap in the fence and ran to freedom, running up a small sand dune and into surrounding bush.|$|R
40|$|The 2008 International Gambling Conference Looking Forward: New Directions in Research and Minimising Public Harm {{took place}} on 21 to 23 February 2008 at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, Auckland. On 20 February 2008, two full-day Pre-Conference Workshops were held. In {{addition}} to keynote presentations from leading authorities, there were parallel sessions of papers and short workshops selected from proposals submitted by conference participants. For the second time (and in response to positive feedback from the 2006 conference) there was a ‘community voices’ session which was a forum {{for people who have}} been impacted by problem gambling, to speak out about their experiences. The Conference provided participants with a forum to examine new and emerging gambling technologies along with their various impacts and consequences. In addition, the papers and short workshops had an emphasis on measures to prevent and reduce harm associated with gambling, including harm from problem gambling. This included government policy and regulation, community engagement and advocacy, industry practice, public education, prevention and early and brief interventions, treatment and <b>rehabilitation.</b> The Pre-Conference <b>Workshops</b> focused on treatment of problem gamblers, and public health/social marketing approaches to reducing gambling harm. The Conference and Workshops brought together service providers and consumers, government officials and regulators, industry representatives, researchers and academics in gambling and related fields.

40|$|Abstract Background In Canada, one {{in three}} adults or almost 9 million people report having a chronic condition. Over two thirds of total deaths result from {{cardiovascular}} disease, diabetes, cancer and respiratory illness and 77 % of persons ≥ 65 years {{have at least one}} chronic condition. Persons with chronic disease are at risk for functional decline; as a result, there is an increased awareness of the significance of functional status as an important health outcome. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine whether patients who receive a multi-component rehabilitation intervention, including online monitoring of function with feedback and self-management workshops, showed less functional decline than case matched controls who did not receive this intervention. In addition, we wanted to determine whether capacity building initiatives within the Family Health Team promote a collaborative approach to Chronic Disease Management. Methods A population-based multi-component rehabilitation intervention delivered to persons with chronic illnesses (≥ 44 yrs) (n = 60) was compared to a group of age and sex matched controls (n = 60) with chronic illnesses receiving usual care within a primary healthcare setting. The population-based intervention consisted of four main components: (1) function-based individual assessment and action planning, (2) <b>rehabilitation</b> self-management <b>workshops,</b> (3) on-line self-assessment of function and (4) organizational capacity building. T-tests and chi-square tests were used for continuous and categorical variables respectively in baseline comparison between groups. Results Two MANOVA showed significant between group differences in patient reported physical functioning (Λ = 0. 88, F = (2. 86) = 5. 97. p = 0. 004) and for the physical performance measures collectively as the dependent variable (Λ = 0. 80, F = (6. 93) = 3. 68. p = 0. 0025). There were no within group differences for the capacity measures. Conclusion It is feasible to monitor physical functioning as a health outcome for persons with chronic illness in primary care. The timeline for this study was not sufficient to show an increase in the capacity within the team; however there were some differences in patient outcomes. The short timeline was likely not sufficient to build the capacity required to support this approach. Trial registration NCT 00859638 </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{aging of}} Europe's {{population}} {{is a crucial}} challenge for the 21 st century. Today, the mean life expectancy in Sweden is 83 years for women and 78 for men. Providing health care of high quality on equal terms for all citizens is an important political goal in Sweden. It is a great challenge for providers to achieve elderly care of high quality and to develop products, services and technologies that {{meet the needs of}} elderly people. Increased use of various forms of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can enable the citizens to take more active part in their own health care. Dimensions of empowerment such as participation and ability to influence/control one's life situation imply an approach to health care with the patient/client in focus. The aim of this thesis was to explore different dimensions of empowerment and empowerment methodology for elderly persons in home health care, and if ICT is a useful tool in this process. Methods used included interviews with patients with experience of <b>rehabilitation,</b> reflective learning <b>workshops</b> with first line staff in home care and an intervention where a mobile safety alarm was tested by elderly individuals. Different analysis methods were used, including Grounded Theory, Latent content analysis and constructivist Grounded Theory together with reflections. My findings were that the process of rehabilitation was experienced as a parallel process based on traditional and individual models, implying that a patient copes with a situation by shifting between being compliant and adopting more self-regulatory behaviour. The results indicated low patient participation in and influence on the rehabilitation process in the hospital. When ICT as an empowering tool was implemented, findings showed that elderly people experienced the use of a mobile safety alarm as an empowering tool. The mobile safety alarm gave the freedom of movement needed to be physical active and still feel safe. The positioning device was not experienced as a threat to their integrity. Mobility and safety were experienced as more important than privacy. Freedom of movement and mobility were described as matters of freedom and empowerment. My research findings indicate that in order to improve home health care services from the patient's/client's perspective, we need to work with the triads of participation, empowerment and mobile Information and Communication Technology. We need to critically and creatively reflect on what clients say and then try to respond positively to what we learn. Real improvement might only occur when accountability changes.
