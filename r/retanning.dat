40|$|The {{leather tanning}} {{industry}} {{is characterized by}} the production of different kinds of effluents, generated in each step of leather processing. These effluents have various chemical compounds which may cause toxicity and endocrine disruption and are thus known as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC). Tanning stabilizes the protein structure of the hide and imparts heat stability, enhanced tensile properties, and resistance to microbial degradation. Currently most high quality leather is "chrome-tanned," produced by treatment of the hide with salts of the mineral chromium. In this study, the wastewater characteristics and ecotoxicity before and after tanning and <b>retanning</b> processes using mimosa tannin are assessed. Vegetable leather production procedure was followed using one dose mimosa tannin. Leather quality was evaluated according to standard methods. Wastewater characteristics showed that mimosa contributed high organic content to the wastewater. Although vegetable tannin was used the effluent toxicity was observed in tanning and <b>retanning</b> effluents. The preliminary results also showed that leather quality tests failed or at minimum level to comply with the standard values indicating that there is still a need to optimize the procedure including mimosa dose.

A polimerização foi conduzida pelo processo em massa, usando CuBr/PMDETA como sistema catalítico e EBP como iniciador.

Todos os polímeros aumentaram a estabilidade térmica do couro. O polímero parcialmente hidrolisado apresentou a pior ação recurtente quando comparado com o polímero de mesma massa molar, mas totalmente hidrolisado. O poli(acrilato de sódio) com maior massa molar (Mn = 66. 000 g/mol) desenvolveu os piores resultados em propriedades físicas e penetração nas fibras do couro, enquanto que aquele com menor massa molar (Mn = 6. 100 g/mol) resultou nas melhores propriedades de maciez e resistência física.
