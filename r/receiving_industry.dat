40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to develop and {{estimate}} a model of production with endogenous technological change. Technological change arises from R&D capital accumulation decisions. These decisions respond to market and government incentives and generate R&D capital spillovers. A spillover network of senders and receivers is estimated. The network shows that each <b>receiving</b> <b>industry</b> is affected by a distinct set of R&D sources and each sending industry affects a unique set of receivers. For the receivers, spillovers generally expand product markets, lower product prices, increase production costs and input demands. For the sources, significant R&D spillovers cause the social rates of return to R&D capital to be substantially above the private returns...|$|E
40|$|Women in {{ophthalmology}} are growing {{in number and}} have made strides in traditional metrics of professional achievement. Professional ties to industry represent another potential means of career advancement, recognition, and income. To report the representation of women among ophthalmologists <b>receiving</b> <b>industry</b> remuneration for research, consulting, honoraria, grants, royalties, and faculty/speaker roles. In this observational, retrospective study, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Open Payments database for payments to ophthalmologists by biomedical companies was reviewed for representation, median payments, and mean payments by women and men for industry relationships in 2013 and 2014. The analysis was performed from July 2015 to November 2015. The primary outcome measures were percentage representation of women vs men overall and in industry research, consulting, speaking roles, royalties and licenses, grants, services other than consulting, and honoraria. Secondary outcome measures included mean and median payments from industry to female vs male ophthalmologists. In 2013, 4164 of 21   380 (19. 5 %) ophthalmologists were women, and of 1204 ophthalmologists analyzed for industry payments, 176 (4. 2 %) women had industry ties compared with 1028 (6 %) men (P[*]<[*]. 001). Mean payments to women were $ 11   419 compared with $ 20   957 for men (P[*]=[*]. 001), and median payments to women were $ 3000 compared with $ 4787 for men (P[*]=[*]. 007). In 2013, women were underrepresented among ophthalmologists <b>receiving</b> <b>industry</b> payments for research (49 of 462 [10. 6 %]), consulting (96 of 610 [15. 7 %]), honoraria (3 of 47 [6. 4 %]), industry grants (1 of 7 [14. 3 %]), royalties and licenses (1 of 13 [7. 7 %]), and faculty/speaker roles (2 of 48 [4. 2 %]). In 2014, 4352 of 21   531 (20. 2 %) of ophthalmologists were women. Of 1518 ophthalmologists analyzed for industry payments, 255 (6 %) women had industry ties compared with 1263 (7. 4 %) men (P[*]<. 001). Mean payments to women were $ 14   848 compared with $ 30   513 for men (P[*]=[*]. 004), and median payments to women were $ 3750 compared with $ 5000 for men (P[*]=[*]. 005). Women remained underrepresented among ophthalmologists <b>receiving</b> <b>industry</b> payments for research (25 of 241 [10. 4 %]), consulting (145 of 921 [15. 7 %]), honoraria (14 of 11 [12. 6 %]), industry grants (3 of 25 [12. 0 %]), royalties and licenses (1 of 22 [4. 6 %]), and faculty/speaker roles (21 of 189 [11. 1 %]) in 2014. Women make up a minority of ophthalmologists with professional industry relationships, and the average woman partnering with industry earns less than her male colleagues.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the link between}} productivity and labour mobility. The hypothesis tested is that technology is transmitted across industries through the movement of skilled workers embodying human capital. The embodied knowledge is then diffused within the new environment creating spillovers and leading to productivity improvements. The empirical analysis is based on household survey and industry-level data for a sample of 12 EU countries covering the years 1995 - 2005. The estimates document the importance of positive cross-sectoral knowledge spillovers and indicate that labour mobility has considerable beneficial effects on industry productivity. Possible endogeneity problems related to labour mobility are tackled by employing a two stage instrumental variables approach. Moreover we show that the spillover effects vary considerably by technology level of the giving industry. While workers moving away from high and medium-tech industries are found to produce positive productivity effects for the <b>receiving</b> <b>industry,</b> no effect is found for those coming from low-tech industries.

Empirical results are presented employing data from thirteen manufacturing industries in eight OECD countries over the period of 1970 to 1991. We confirm, first, earlier findings that R&D expenditures are positively related to productivity levels, and estimate an elasticity of TFP with respect to own-industry R&D between 7 % and 17 %. Second, the <b>receiving</b> <b>industry</b> benefits also from other industries' technology investments, an effect which is at least in part due to trade in embodied technology. We find that the benefit derived from foreign R&D in the same industry is in the order of 50 %- 95 % of the productivity effect of own R&D. Third, for domestic interindustry technology flows, the results strongly suggest that trade in goods is not all that matters for technology transmission. We estimate that domestic, outside-industry R&D is one-fifth to one-half as effective in raising" productivity as own-industry R&D for these industries. ...|$|E
30|$|Application {{of organic}} acids as {{preservative}} agents and disinfectants {{is a common}} practice in drug, cosmetic and food industries (Rico et al. 2007). Moreover, particular interest for different organic acids is continuously increasing worldwide creating thereby a necessity for production of huge quantities of these chemicals. From economical point of view, {{it is more important}} to produce concentrated as opposed to diluted acids because of the direct impact on the handling and transportation costs. However, handling and transportation of concentrated organic acids is extremely hazardous and special security means must be taken to avoid any poisoning risk and injuries. Moreover, the <b>receiving</b> <b>industry</b> must have special storage and adequate managing conditions for these chemicals. In this context, handling and managing of salts of organic acids is suitable and easier because of the high level of safety and facility of storage and handling (Yoo et al. 2010; Luttrell 2012). Although the reactivity of organic acids is higher than that of the conjugated salt, it is possible to convert a salt of an organic acid to the acid form so as to obtain the desired reactivity. In this context, electrochemical activation (or simply “electro-activation”) of salt of an organic acid allows its conversion to the acid form under safe conditions.|$|E
40|$|A widely {{excepted}} axiom is that transport {{demand is}} driven by economic activity. Consequently there is much research on {{the connection between the}} economy and freight transport. It is also accepted that highly aggregate indicators like the GDP are not suitable for forecasting purposes of specific commodities. In this paper we analyse the connection between distinct industries and commodities. Four conten-tions are proved for the case of Germany based on publicly available data from 1999 to 2007 : (1) gross value added (GVA) is a suitable variable to derive the amount of freight transported in a country; (2) supply and use tables help in identi-fying the economic activities with relevance for the transport demand of specific commodities; (3) the consideration of dynamics in GVA development is para-mount for freight generation, more than the dynamics of the economic structure (i. e. the change in relevant industries for specific commodities); (4) economic ac-tivities on the consumer side of commodities (<b>receiving</b> <b>industry)</b> explain best the freight generation. These four findings are of interest for freight modelling and forecasting. They also contribute to the discussion regarding coupling and decou-pling of transport from economic growth by showing that for a majority of com-modities a close tie between freight transport and economic growth of specific in-dustries exists...|$|E

40|$|Background: Tobacco is {{the single}} largest cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the developed world; in the former socialist bloc tobacco kills twice as many men as in the west. Although evidence shows that liberalisation of the cigarette trade through the elimination of import barriers leads to significant increases in consumption, far less is known about the impact of foreign direct investment on cigarette consumption. This paper seeks to explore the impact that the substantial transnational tobacco company investments have had on patterns of tobacco trade and consumption in the former Soviet Union. Design: Routine data were used to explore trends in cigarette trade and consumption in the 15 countries of the former Soviet Union from the 1960 s to the present day. Comparisons were made between trends in countries that have received substantial investment from the tobacco transnationals and countries that have not. Results: Between 1991 and 2000 cigarette production increased by 96 % in countries <b>receiving</b> <b>industry</b> investment and by 11 % in countries that did not. Over the same period cigarette consumption increased by 40 %; the increase was concentrated in countries receiving investments. Despite these investments, cigarette imports still outweigh exports and no trade surplus has yet to result. Conclusions: The findings suggest that liberalisation of inward investment has a significant and positive impact on cigarette consumption and that without appropriate safeguards, market liberalisation may have long term negative impacts on health. Specific trade rules are needed to govern trade and investment in this uniquely harmful product. Implementation of effective tobacco control policies should precede tobacco industry privatisation. International financial organisations pressing for privatisation should ensure this occurs...|$|E

40|$|Tour guides {{are one of}} {{the most}} visible players in tourism but little {{scholarly}} attention has been given to the links that tour guides may have with sustainable development. This study addresses the gap by promoting an understanding of how tour guides can assist in moving tourism in a sustainable direction. Sustainable development is expected to improve the quality of life for all people without causing undesirable ecological and socio-cultural outcomes. As a central agent in the entire tourism system, tour guides have a variety of roles to play in response to the expectations of the various tourism stakeholders. A literature review suggests that tour guides can contribute to destinations'sustainable development by exerting their functions on experience management, resources management and local economic promotion. Interpretative guiding is the means by which tour guides can realize these above potentials. A case study was conducted in Hainan, China. The guiding performance there was examined to see whether and to what extent tour guides are contributing to the achievement of local sustainability. It was discovered that the tour guides in Hainan do not exert (well) their expected functions either in enhancing enjoyable experiences for tourists, in supporting local resource conservation, or in promoting the healthy development of the local economy. Their potentials are blocked by the issues and problems of instant money-making-centered guiding conduct, below-cost group <b>receiving</b> <b>industry</b> practices and unfair remuneration system for the guides, absence of protection measures to ensure the guides’ interests, opportunism in guiding and lenient certificating requirements, lack of professionalism and effective training, ineffective monitoring measures, and limited awareness of sustainable development. In order to better the situation, unhealthy travel and trade industry practice should be banned; effective certificating, training and monitoring measures should be developed and implemented; tour guides’ personal interests should be protected and local awareness of sustainability, in particular that of the industry members, should be fostered. Serious efforts of the government administration as well as industry members and tour guides are required if tour guides are to fulfill their potential as agents of sustainable development...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Even {{after the}} Women's Health Initiative (WHI) {{found that the}} risks of menopausal hormone therapy (hormone therapy) outweighed benefit for {{asymptomatic}} women, about half of gynecologists in the United States continued to believe that hormones benefited women's health. The pharmaceutical industry has supported publication of articles in medical journals for marketing purposes. It is unknown whether author relationships with industry affect promotional tone in articles on hormone therapy. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine whether promotional tone could be identified in narrative review articles regarding menopausal hormone therapy and whether articles identified as promotional were more likely to have been authored by those with conflicts of interest with manufacturers of menopausal hormone therapy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed tone in opinion pieces on hormone therapy published in the four years after the estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI was stopped. First, we identified the ten authors with four or more MEDLINE-indexed reviews, editorials, comments, or letters on hormone replacement therapy or menopausal hormone therapy published between July 2002 and June 2006. Next, we conducted an additional search using the names of these authors to identify other relevant articles. Finally, after author names and affiliations were removed, 50 articles were evaluated by three readers for scientific accuracy and for tone. Scientific accuracy was assessed based on whether or not the findings of the WHI were accurately reported using two criteria: (1) Acknowledgment or lack of denial of the risk of breast cancer diagnosis associated with hormone therapy, and (2) acknowledgment that hormone therapy did not benefit cardiovascular disease endpoints. Determination of promotional tone was based on the assessment by each reader of whether the article appeared to promote hormone therapy. Analysis of inter-rater consistency found moderate agreement for scientific accuracy (κ= 0. 57) and substantial agreement for promotional tone (κ= 0. 65). After discussion, readers found 86 % of the articles to be scientifically accurate and 64 % to be promotional in tone. Themes that were common in articles considered promotional included attacks on the methodology of the WHI, arguments that clinical trial results should not guide treatment for individuals, and arguments that observational studies are as good as or better than randomized clinical trials for guiding clinical decisions. The promotional articles we identified also implied that the risks associated with hormone therapy have been exaggerated and that the benefits of hormone therapy have been or will be proven. Of the ten authors studied, eight were found to have declared payment for speaking or consulting on behalf of menopausal hormone manufacturers or for research support (seven of these eight were speakers or consultants). Thirty of 32 articles (90 %) evaluated as promoting hormone therapy were authored by those with potential financial conflicts of interest, compared to 11 of 18 articles (61 %) by those without such conflicts (p= 0. 0025). Articles promoting the use of menopausal hormone therapy were 2. 41 times (95 % confidence interval 1. 49 - 4. 93) as likely to have been authored by authors with conflicts of interest as by authors without conflicts of interest. In articles from three authors with conflicts of interest some of the same text was repeated word-for-word in different articles. CONCLUSION: There may be a connection between <b>receiving</b> <b>industry</b> funding for speaking, consulting, or research and the publication of promotional opinion pieces on menopausal hormone therapy...|$|E
