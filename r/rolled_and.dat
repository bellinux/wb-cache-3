5|$|Seven minutes later, {{two other}} high-calibre shells struck the Bretagne {{at the same}} time. The first detonated {{at the base of}} the tripod mast, igniting some {{ready-to-use}} anti-aircraft projectiles which were stored in lockers next to the anti-aircraft mounts. The second went through the central 138 mm casement, exploding deep inside the ship. A fire started, with leaking oil burning next to the ship. In about thirty seconds, the ship <b>rolled</b> <b>and</b> exploded.|$|E
5|$|Jolly Green 67 flew east at first, {{further into}} {{territory}} {{held by the}} North Vietnamese, before it turned southeast for a few kilometers, when a fire {{broke out in the}} left engine. Pieces of the tail rotor struck the main rotor, and the aircraft <b>rolled</b> <b>and</b> crashed on its left side, burning ferociously. No rescue beepers were heard. The entire crew was listed as MIA and presumed killed: Capt. Peter Hayden Chapman II (pilot), Capt. John Henry Call III (co-pilot), TSgt. William Roy Pearson, TSgt. Allen J. Avery (para-rescuemen), TSgt. Roy D. Prater (Crew Chief), and Sgt. James Harold Alley (combat photographer). The fire consuming the helicopter was so hot it melted parts of the aircraft and continued to burn for three more days.|$|E
5|$|The main {{mission of}} the 96th was {{patching}} Jackson Drome's runways after Japanese bombing, but they also assisted with refuelling aircraft and loading them with bombs, and unloading ships in the harbour. It was found that craters could not be repaired simply by filling the holes with rubble. This would quickly fill with water, settle, and become a bog hole. A proper repair required that the water be pumped out, and the crater filled with stone, {{which had to be}} compacted, <b>rolled</b> <b>and</b> re-surfaced. In addition to the craters, bombing sprayed fragments over the runways that could cause punctures and blowouts in airplane tyres, resulting in accidents on takeoff and landing. A visual search for fragments had to be made after each bombing raid.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: For buliding the mathmatical {{model of}} elastic {{deformation}} for rolls {{system with a}} composite back-up roll assemblled by the shrinkage fit, the <b>roll</b> sleeve <b>and</b> <b>roll</b> mandrel was studied individually, the bending force was acted on the working <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> the load acted on the contact zone was discreted segment by segment, then the deflection model of the working <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> the <b>roll</b> sleeve <b>and</b> <b>roll</b> mandrel was put forward based on the influence function method. According to the force equilibrim function and the deformation compatibility function between the roll sleeve, the <b>roll</b> mandrel <b>and</b> working <b>roll,</b> the solution matrix was listed and the solving programe was compiled to solve the deflection of working <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> composite back-up <b>roll,</b> the pressure between the working <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> the <b>roll</b> sleeve <b>and</b> the cross-section thickness of rolled strip.

5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function {{was to establish}} and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between the deck and the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship <b>rolled</b> <b>and</b> pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{on which}} the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, {{probably}} by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858). The piece was evidently sent <b>rolled</b> <b>and</b> unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running {{along the top of}} the cloth is evidence that the frame was eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended. This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us to see some of the colours as they would have originally appeared.|$|E

25|$|Law 9: Preparation and {{maintenance}} of the playing area. When a cricket ball is bowled it almost always bounces on the pitch, and the behaviour of the ball is greatly influenced by {{the condition of the}} pitch.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{attitude control}} of a small gravity gradient stabilised satellite. A gravity gradient stabilised satellite has limited stability and pointing capabilities, and magnetic coils are added {{in order to improve}} the accuracy of the attitude control. The magnetic coils are controlled using a fuzzy logic controller, based on a combination of membership functions and rules. The control of the pitch axis is separated from the <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> azimuth axes and excellent pitch angle accuracy is achieved. The <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> azimuth axes are controlled using a common magnetic coil, that has a non-linear and time-varying torque characteristic <b>and,</b> therefore, accurate <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> azimuth angular control become much more difficult to achieve. However, combining one <b>roll</b> controller <b>and</b> two azimuth controllers result in an acceptable <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> azimuth angular accuracy after a few orbital periods...|$|R
50|$|The three {{adjacent}} {{rolls of}} a {{three roll mill}} (called the feed <b>roll,</b> centre <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> apron <b>roll)</b> rotate at progressively higher speeds. Material, usually {{in the form of}} paste, is fed between the feed <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> the center <b>roll.</b> Due to the narrowing space between the rolls, most of the paste initially remains in the feed region. The part that makes it through the first in-running nip experiences very high shear force due to the different rotation speeds of the two rolls. Upon exiting, the material that remains on the center roll moves through the second nip between the center <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> apron <b>roll.</b> This subjects it to an even higher shear force, due to the higher speed of the apron <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> typically, a smaller gap than between the feed <b>and</b> centre <b>rolls.</b> A knife blade then scrapes the processed material off the apron <b>roll</b> <b>and</b> the paste <b>rolls</b> down the apron. This milling cycle can be repeated several times to maximize dispersion.|$|R

25|$|Through the centuries, {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} for processing tea, and a number of different forms of tea, were developed. During the Tang dynasty, tea was steamed, then pounded and shaped into cake form, while in the Song dynasty, loose-leaf tea was developed and became popular. During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, unoxidized tea leaves were first pan-fried, then <b>rolled</b> <b>and</b> dried, a process that stops the oxidation process that turns the leaves dark, thereby allowing tea to remain green. In the 15th century, oolong tea, in which the leaves were allowed to partially oxidize before pan-frying, was developed. Western tastes, however, favoured the fully oxidized black tea, and the leaves were allowed to oxidize further. Yellow tea was an accidental discovery in the production of green tea during the Ming dynasty, when apparently sloppy practices allowed the leaves to turn yellow, but yielded a different flavour as a result.|$|E

25|$|The {{lamp housing}} is a metal or plastic {{container}} {{that serves as}} a body for the entire instrument and prevents light from spilling in unwanted directions. It comprises all of the exterior of the fixture except for the lens or opening. The housing may be designed with specific elements that help reduce heat and increase the efficiency of a lamp. Older instruments were made from <b>rolled</b> <b>and</b> machined steel or aluminum. With the advent of the Source Four, many lighting instruments are being made from die cast metal. Die casting allows for one single, light-weight body that is more economical to produce and use. The first lantern to make use of die castings was the Strand Pattern 23 designed by Fred Bentham in 1953, this small mirror spot enjoyed a 30-year production run and found its way into many British schools, halls and theaters. Some instruments are made from plastic, such as the Selecon Pacific.|$|E
25|$|Thread forming {{and thread}} rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not <b>rolled,</b> <b>and</b> some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to unthreaded shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.|$|E
25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well <b>rolled</b> <b>and</b> mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has got so upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E
