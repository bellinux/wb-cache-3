2500|$|Option ARMs {{are often}} offered {{with a very}} low teaser rate (often as low as 1%) which {{translates}} into very low minimum payments {{for the first year}} of the ARM. During boom times, lenders often underwrite borrowers based on mortgage payments that are below the fully amortizing payment level. This enables borrowers to qualify for a much larger loan (i.e., take on more debt) than would otherwise be possible. When evaluating an Option ARM, prudent borrowers will not focus on the teaser rate or initial payment level, but will consider the characteristics of the index, the size of the [...] "mortgage margin" [...] that is added to the index value, and the other terms of the ARM. Specifically, they need to consider the possibilities that (1) long-term interest <b>rates</b> <b>go</b> up; (2) their home may not appreciate or may even lose value or even (3) that both risks may materialize.|$|E
2500|$|Between 2001 and 2003, the Bush {{administration}} {{instituted a}} federal {{tax cut for}} all taxpayers. Among other changes, the lowest income tax rate was lowered from 15% to 10%, the 27% <b>rate</b> <b>went</b> to 25%, the 30% <b>rate</b> <b>went</b> to 28%, the 35% <b>rate</b> <b>went</b> to 33%, and the top marginal tax <b>rate</b> <b>went</b> from 39.6% to 35%. In addition, the child tax credit went from $500 to $1000, and the [...] "marriage penalty" [...] was reduced. Since the cuts were implemented {{as part of the}} annual congressional budget resolution, which protected the bill from filibusters, numerous amendments, and more than 20 hours of debate, it had to include a sunset clause. Unless congress passed legislation making the tax cuts permanent, they were set to expire after the 2010 tax year.|$|R

50|$|Assuming {{a closed}} economy, where foreign capital or trade {{does not affect}} the money supply, when money supply increases, {{interest}} <b>rates</b> <b>go</b> down. Businesses and consumers have a lower cost of capital and can increase spending and capital improvement projects. This encourages short-term growth. Conversely, when the money supply falls, interest <b>rates</b> <b>go</b> up, increasing the cost of capital and leading to more conservative spending and investment. The Federal reserve increases interest rates to combat Inflation.|$|E

50|$|The largest {{market for}} {{callable}} bonds {{is that of}} issues from government sponsored entities. They own a lot of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. In the U.S., mortgages are usually fixed rate, and can be prepaid early without cost, {{in contrast to the}} norms in other countries. If <b>rates</b> <b>go</b> down, many home owners will refinance at a lower rate. As a consequence, the agencies lose assets. By issuing a large number of callable bonds, they have a natural hedge, as they can then call their own issues and refinance at a lower rate.|$|E

5000|$|Thus, {{the issuer}} has an option which it pays for by {{offering}} a higher coupon rate.

[...] Another way to look at this interplay is that, as interest <b>rates</b> <b>go</b> down, the price of the bonds go up; therefore, it is advantageous to buy the bonds back at par value.|$|E

50|$|The VaR {{risk measure}} defines risk as {{mark-to-market}} loss {{on a fixed}} portfolio over a fixed time horizon. There are many alternative risk measures in finance. Given the inability to use mark-to-market (which uses market prices to define loss) for future performance, loss is often defined (as a substitute) as change in fundamental value. For example, if an institution holds a loan that declines in market price because interest <b>rates</b> <b>go</b> up, but has no change in cash flows or credit quality, some systems do not recognize a loss. Also some try to incorporate the economic cost of harm not measured in daily financial statements, such as loss of market confidence or employee morale, impairment of brand names or lawsuits.|$|E
