500|$|Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune {{believed}} Nolan and Goyer {{managed to}} [...] "comfortably mix the tormented drama and revenge motifs with light hearted gags and comic book allusions," [...] and that Nolan takes the series {{out of the}} [...] "slam-bang Hollywood jokefests" [...] the franchise had drifted into. Comic book scribe and editor Dennis O'Neil stated that he [...] "felt the filmmakers really understood the character they were translating", citing this film as {{the best of the}} live-action Batman films. In contrast, J.R. Jones, from the Chicago Reader, criticized the script, and Nolan and David Goyer for not living up to the [...] "hype about exploring Batman's damaged psyche". Roger Ebert, who gave mixed reviews to the previous films, and claimed in his review for Batman Returns that he did not believe noir worked in superhero films, wrote this was [...] "the Batman movie I've been waiting for; more correctly, this is the movie I did not <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> waiting for". Giving it four out of four stars, he commended the realistic portrayals of the Batman arsenal – the Batsuit, Batcave, Tumbler, and the Batsignal – as well as the focus on [...] "the story and character" [...] with less stress on [...] "high-tech action".|$|E
500|$|For authenticity, several British and German actors {{portrayed the}} British sailors and Nazi soldiers, whose {{dialogue}} was mostly in German. Trevor Goddard, who portrayed the First British Crewman, is English, while Madison Mason, who played Captain Yip Harburg, is American; he affected an English accent for the part. William B. Davis' dialogue was entirely in German, a language {{which he did}} not speak. He later explained, [...] "I certainly didn't <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be speaking a lot of German until I got the script, which just said 'CSM (in German)'." [...] To successfully learn his lines, one of the German cast members recorded all of Davis' dialogue onto a cassette. Davis was given the cassette two weeks before shooting and phonetically memorized his lines; he noted that the method [...] "seemed to work pretty well—at least to non-German-speaking people! It was a little more challenging because there were some real German speakers on the show, which I thought was a little unfair." [...] The only main cast member of The X-Files who already spoke German was Mitch Pileggi. Pileggi had studied in Germany; he had to re-write many of his lines as they made no sense {{in the context of the}} scenes. The tagline that usually appears after the opening credits of every episode, [...] "The Truth is Out There", was translated into German: [...] "Die Wahrheit ist irgendwo da draußen".|$|E

5000|$|Roberts would recall writing [...] "You Are the Woman": [...] "When that chorus and tune {{jumped into}} my head <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not creating...one of the great works of art in history...rather a bouncy little pop ditty...I was stumped for several months about where the verses should go develop lyrically. Then <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> over {{thinking}} it. I took a more simple approach, and the verses were finished {{in a day or}} two." ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2007, Michael said he {{had hidden}} the fact he was gay because of worries over what effect it might have on his mother. In 2009 Michael said: [...] "My {{depression}} {{at the end of}} Wham! was because I was beginning to <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> gay, not bisexual." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was twelve}} o'clock exactly when I hooked him, {{and a quarter}} of an hour sped by. My first big thrill came when he leaped. This was a surprise. He was fooling round, and then, all of a sudden, he broke water clear. It was an awkward, {{ponderous}} action, and looked as if he had come up backward, like a bucking bronco. His size and his long, sinister sword amazed me and frightened me. It gave me a cold sensation to <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> hooked to a huge, dangerous fish. But that in itself was a new kind of thrill. No boatman fears a Marlin as he does the true broadbill swordfish.|$|E
60|$|I fired {{my first}} {{shot at a}} fellow-creature within four days of my arrival. We rode out {{down the road to}} the south to search some hills, and found the Boers in fair {{strength}} away to the east of us. We were dismounted and pushed up on foot through a wood to a grassy crest. There for the first time I saw the enemy, little respectable-looking unsoldierlike figures, mostly in black, dodging about upon a ridge perhaps a mile away. I took a shot at one of these figures just before it vanished into a gully. One or two bullets came overhead, and I tried to remember what I had picked up about cover. They made a sound, whiff-er-whiff, a kind of tearing whistle, and there was nothing but a distant crackling to give one a hint of their direction until they took effect. I remember the peculiar smell of the grass amidst which I crouched, my sudden disgust to <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> lying, and had to lie now for an indefinite time, in the open sunlight and far from any shade, and how I wondered whether after all I had wanted to come to this war.|$|E
2500|$|Jason Jr. {{would later}} say [...] "One {{of the most}} {{damaging}} things for me, <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> now, <b>was</b> playing a drunk in the play Long Day's Journey Into Night. In the play, the drunk's father is a failed artist {{and his mother was}} a drug addict.

6000|$|... "Friends and neighbors, I {{have always}} been held by you as an honest man. It was the shame of having you know I was not which has kept me back from open {{confession}} and testimony. Just afore these meetings commenced I come home from town one night and found that somebody had passed a counterfeit ten-dollar bill on me. Then Satan entered into me and possessed me. When Mrs. Rachel Lynde come next day, collecting for foreign missions, I give her that ten dollar bill. She never knowed the difference, and sent it away with the rest. But I knew I'd done a mean and sinful thing. I couldn't drive {{it out of my}} thoughts. A few days afterwards I went down to Mrs. Rachel's and give her ten good dollars for the fund. I told her I had come to the conclusion I ought to give more than ten dollars, out of my abundance, to the Lord. That was a lie. Mrs. Lynde thought I was a generous man, and I felt ashamed to look her in the face. But I'd done what I could to right the wrong, and I thought it would be all right. But it wasn't. I've never known a minute's peace of mind or conscience since. I tried to cheat the Lord, and then tried to patch it up by doing something that redounded to my worldly credit. When these meetings begun, and everybody expected me to testify, I couldn't do it. It would have seemed like blasphemy. And I couldn't endure the thought of telling what I'd done, either. I argued it all out a thousand times that I hadn't done any real harm after all, but it was no use. I've been so wrapped up in my own brooding and misery that I didn't <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> inflicting suffering on those dear to me by my conduct, and, maybe, holding some of them back from the paths of salvation. But my eyes have been opened to this to-night, and the Lord has given me strength to confess my sin and glorify His holy name." ...|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Chris Azzopardi of Pride Source she said [...] "I didn't even know I was (gay) until later in life. I mean, I realized I was bisexual at about 18 but I didn't even <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> gay until into my 20s." ...|$|E
500|$|Blumenfeld {{was born}} in Afula, Israel, and moved to Los Angeles {{at the age of}} two with his parents and two older brothers—his family is Reform Jewish. He has {{described}} how he became aware of his humor early on: [...] "I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> funny at an early age, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> could make people laugh at a later age, and then by college time, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to make jokes in terms of writing".|$|R

5000|$|April 20, 2010 - 36th Alaska Folk Festival: Graceman {{performed}} at the annual festival along with other folk and bluegrass bands.

5000|$|Kari Lizer, one of {{the staff}} writers, who later went on to create The New Adventures of Old Christine, said, [...] "Weird Science {{turned out to be}} the best job because it made me <b>realize</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> more than an actress who could write monologues for herself.

5000|$|He {{first became}} {{interested}} in broadcasting when he was 12 years old, watching soldiers from The Perth Regiment marching home from World War II, and heard the commentators from CJCS talking about it.

60|$|It {{was only}} when his eyes bulged out and his tongue protruded, as after the hangman has {{finished}} his work, that <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> within an ace of taking a human life.
