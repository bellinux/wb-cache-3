40|$|Creative {{problem solving}} is {{essential}} to technology education. In our research project we explored the suggestion that creativity may need to include a time of ‘non-thinking’ during which innovative responses to problem tasks are generated. The period of non-conscious cognitive process (NCCP) time {{is considered to be}} when the brain makes connections between independent ideas and when inappropriate responses can be forgotten, allowing more relevant responses to be made available for problem solving. Our research provided an opportunity for several primary school teachers to focus on enhancing creativity in technology education and to explore the notion of the NCCP time for creative problem solving. In this chapter we review the current literature on enhancing creativity and comment on how the teachers fostered creativity as they implemented a design, make and appraise technological task to produce <b>recycling</b> <b>devices</b> in their classrooms.

This is especially true for electronic equipment, such as mobile phones which are the object of this paper. The short life-cycle, due to the continually substituting of obsolete equipment with new more and more innovative models, has stimulated the growth in sales of electronic goods. This non-stop technological progress, however, has also led to an increased quantity of “electronic waste”. The environmental impact, which is difficult to quantify, is compounded by the rising consumption of resources (such as energy, water and chemical substances) above all in the first steps of the manufacturing process. Contrary to popular thought, the smaller size of mobile phones actually corresponds to a greater material base. Moreover, the very lack of homogeneity of the materials and components in the mobile phones makes it more difficult to recycle them.

40|$|In {{the digital}} age {{there has been a}} {{consistent}} push for consumers to invest in the latest and greatest technology. With the 2009 requirement that television broadcasters switch from analog to digital signals, many consumers have upgraded televisions that are capable of decoding this signal. For the most part this meant upgrading from cathode ray tube devices (CRTs) to flat panel displays. In addition upgrades in technology in computers and cellular networks have made several computers and mobile phones obsolete. Improper disposal of these items can cause a great deal of environmental harm. When CRTs are disposed improperly lead can be released to the surrounding environment. Other electronics may contain high amounts of lead, barium and mercury. These electronics can contain valuable materials as well, such as gold, which can be recovered from obsolete devices. Because of the environmental damage that can occur when electronic items are disposed of improperly, 29 states have passed legislation which encourage <b>recycling</b> of electronic <b>devices</b> and discourage the disposal of these items in landfills. Many of these states have passed producer responsibility laws which makes the manufacturer of electronics responsible for providing end-of-life disposal options other than landfill or incinerator disposal of items. Because each state legislature is different, rules that are in place differ. This paper separated the 29 states that have passed legislation into five groups based on the type of law in place. Each state’s legislation and rules are summarized. The majority of these states belong to a group which requires manufacturers to set up recycling programs for residents and the manufacturers must meet a predetermined recycling goal. The next group contains seven states that require manufacturers to implement collection programs for residents so they can recycle their old electronics but, manufacturers are not required to meet a collection and recycling goal. Six states have responded with legislation that puts the state in charge of collection of electronic devices with manufacturers paying for the programs. Five states belong to a group which requires either education of residents on how to recycle electronics or prohibits residents from disposing of certain devices in landfills. Last, is California which runs a statewide collection program but, residents pay for collection of items through a fee at the time of purchase of new electronic items. The other 21 states that do not have legislation are broken down into three groups. The first, and largest group, consists of states that either have not proposed or provided information about proposed legislation for electronics recycling. The second group looks at six states that had proposed legislation in the past to see what was proposed and why the legislation did not pass. The third group contains four states that passed legislation for study committees to look into passing legislation for recycling. The paper concludes by looking at the potential sources of confusion for consumers and manufacturers that are required to register with individual states. Electronic devices that are covered by state legislation differ and manufacturer registration dates, fees, reporting requirements and recycling requirements differ as well. Consumers in some states can receive free recycling on some but not all items.

40|$|Recently, halide {{perovskite}} {{solar cells}} have {{attracted much attention}} due to their high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low cost. Their efficiency has been sharply improved from 3. 8 % to 22. 1 % {{in the last six}} years, making them as the promising next generation solar cells. However, the halide perovskite solar cells are facing several serious problems, such as request of further improvement efficiency and the lead pollution. These problems hinder the future commercialization of halide perovskite solar cells. How to solve these problems is still a challenge. The efficiency of perovskite solar cells is strongly affected by the quality of perovskite films, such as the crystallization and coverage, while the lead pollution is attributed to the halide perovskite absorbing materials. Therefore, this thesis mainly focuses on the morphology control of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 to fabricate high-quality perovskite films with good crystallization and full coverage to improve the efficiency. We also design and synthesize new lead-free absorbing materials to avoid the lead pollution. In Chapter 1, the background of solar energy and photovoltaic technologies has been introduced. Furthermore, the recent challenges for the halide perovskite solar cells and the purpose of this thesis have been described. In Chapter 2, the experimental procedures, including general preparation and characterization of perovskite materials and electrodes, as well as devices used in this thesis have been summarized. In Chapter 3, a new method of concentration gradient controlled growth has been developed to prepare high-quality CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite films under ambient conditions. The two-step reactions were used with the concentration gradient of CH 3 NH 3 I (MAI) solutions, yielding the perovskite films with different crystallization and surface morphologies. In details, the first-step reaction between a low concentration MAI solution and the PbI 2 films resulted in the formation of large-scale perovskite grains, and in the second-step reaction with a high concentration MAI solution we achieved a full coverage of the perovskite films. The large grain sizes of ca. 1. 5 μm in the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 perovskite films were obtained using the concentration gradient method, which means that the grain boundaries can be reduced. Meanwhile, spectral absorption in the short- wavelength region was enhanced in the concentration-gradient controlled perovskite films due to light scattering, which is considered to benefit the power conversion of solar cells. The perovskite solar cells fabricated using the concentration gradient controlled method showed higher photovoltaic performance than that by the traditional single solution method. In Chapter 4, the Pb-free composites of bismuth triiodide (BiI 3) and layered perovskite (CH 3 NH 3) 3 Bi 2 I 9 (MBI) have been prepared by a simple solution method for thin film solar cells. It was found that the introduction of MBI significantly enhanced the crystallization and coverage of BiI 3, meanwhile there was a multi-absorption phenomenon in the composite films. In addition, the band bending occurred at the BiI 3 -MBI interfaces, accompanying with the tuned energy levels in the composite films. The band bending was considered to benefit the efficient injection of excited electrons from absorbing layers into the electron transport layers. When 10 - 20 % of MBI were used, the short circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) were improved in the composite solar cells. An enhancement of 65 % of the PCE was achieved in the (BiI 3) 0. 8 (MBI) 0. 2 solar cells due to the multi-effects of the composite active layers. In Chapter 5, the Pb-free double perovskites La 2 NiMnO 6 have been studied for potential application on solar cells. The rhombohedral and the monoclinic La 2 NiMnO 6 were respectively formed under different conditions. The monoclinic La 2 NiMnO 6 had an experimental bandgap (Eg) of 1. 4 eV and valence band (VB) of - 5. 8 eV. Whereas, the rhombohedral La 2 NiMnO 6 had an experimental Eg of 1. 2 eV and VB of - 5. 7 eV. Both of them are suitable as visible light absorbers. Furthermore, the density function theory calculation confirmed that the theoretical bandgap of the monoclinic La 2 NiMnO 6 was larger than that of the rhombohedral La 2 NiMnO 6, which was mainly attributed to the B-site distortion. Simultaneously, the top of the VB of La 2 NiMnO 6 mainly come from the interaction of Ni 3 d orbitals and O 2 p orbitals, whereas the bottom of the conduction band primarily come from the hybridization between Mn 3 d and O 2 p orbitals. The results of experimental and theoretical studies indicated that the monoclinic double perovskite La 2 NiMnO 6 is a better candidate as absorbing material than the rhombohedral La 2 NiMnO 6 for solar cells. Finally, general conclusions and future prospects have been presented. The investigations of Pb-based perovskites and Pb-free perovskites solar cells are still facing big challenges. The further studies including architectures designing of <b>devices,</b> <b>recycling</b> of Pb-based perovskites and development of new Pb-free perovskites with high performance are needed. 九州工業大学博士学位論文 学位記番号:生工博甲第 281 号 学位授与年月日:平成 29 年 3 月 24 日 1.
