40|$|Accurate force {{prediction}} from surface electromyography (EMG) {{forms an}} important methodological challenge in biomechanics and kinesiology. In {{a previous study}} (Staudenmann et al., 2006), we illustrated force estimates based on analyses lent from multivariate statistics. In particular, we showed the advantages of principal component analysis (PCA) on monopolar high-density EMG (HD-EMG) over conventional electrode configurations. In the present study, we further improve force estimates by exploiting the correlation structure of the HD-EMG via independent component analysis (ICA). HD-EMG from the triceps brachii muscle and the extension force of the elbow were measured in 11 subjects. The root mean square difference (RMSD) and correlation coefficients between predicted and measured force were determined. Relative to using the monopolar EMG data, PCA yielded a 40 % reduction in RMSD. ICA yielded a significant further reduction of up to 13 % RMSD. Since ICA improved the PCA-based estimates, the independent structure of EMG signals appears to contain <b>relevant</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> for the prediction of muscle force from surface HD-EMG...|$|E

They are an important pool of carbon and their role as sink or source of greenhouse gases is not fully understood. Accurate mapping of the vegetation of Siberia can therefore contribute to a better understanding of these processes at regional scale and of their effects on the climate through regional biosphere modeling. The potential of the combination of radar data with medium-resolution optical data to obtain regional scale land cover mapping is investigated using multi-spectral imagery from the MERIS sensor at 300 m resolution and a high resolution radar mosaic (pixel spacing of 100 m) covering Western and Eastern Siberia compiled in the framework of the Global Boreal Forest Mapping project, an initiative of the Japan Agency for Space Exploration (JAXA).

In addition, heterogeneity in Study results can also be caused by flaws in study design. This paper critically examines some of the potential reasons for heterogeneity and the methods to explore them. Empirical support for the existence of different sources of variation is reviewed.

These were built with an SLA 250 stereolithography apparatus (3 D-Systems, Valencia, CA, USA), steered by FORM-IT/DCS software (University of Zurich, Switzerland).

Subjects and Methods. From the database of the Tinnitus Clinic at Regensburg we identified 75 patients with normal hearing thresholds in the conventional pure-tone audiometry. We contrasted these patients with normal and pathological high-frequency audiogram and compared them with respect to gender, age, tinnitus severity, pitch, laterality and duration, comorbid symptoms and triggers for tinnitus onset. Results. Patients with pathological high frequency audiometry were significantly older and had higher scores on the tinnitus questionnaires in comparison to patients with normal high frequency audiometry. Furthermore, there was an association of high frequency audiometry with the laterality of tinnitus. Conclusion. In tinnitus patients with normal pure-tone audiometry the high frequency audiometry provides useful additional information.

40|$|Introduction: Initial {{diagnostics}} {{and follow-up}} of gliomas is usually based on contrast-enhanced MRI. However, {{the capacity of}} standard MRI to differentiate neoplastic tissue from posttherapeutic effects such as pseudoprogression is limited. Advanced neuroimaging methods may provide <b>relevant</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information,</b> which allow for a more accurate diagnosis especially in clinically equivocal situations. This review article focuses predominantly on PET using radiolabeled amino acids and advanced MRI techniques such as perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) and summarizes the efforts of these methods regarding the identification of pseudoprogression after glioma therapy. Areas covered: The current literature on pseudoprogression {{in the field of}} brain tumors, with a focus on gliomas is summarized. A literature search was performed using the terms ‘pseudoprogression’, ‘temozolomide’, ‘glioblastoma’, ‘PET’, ‘PWI’, ‘radiochemotherapy’, and derivations thereof. Expert commentary: The present literature provides strong evidence that PWI MRI and amino acid PET can be of great value by providing valuable additional diagnostic information in order to overcome the diagnostic challenge of pseudoprogression. Despite various obstacles such as the still limited availability of amino acid PET and the lack of standardization of PWI, the diagnostic improvement probably results in relevant benefits for brain tumor patients and justifies a more widespread use of these diagnostic tools...|$|E

Metabolic imaging using PET may provide <b>relevant</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> on tumor metabolism, which allows a more accurate diagnosis especially in clinically equivocal situations, particularly when radiolabeled amino acids are used.

40|$|Aim To {{investigate}} the contribution to range filling, range extent and climatic niche space of species of {{information contained in}} the largest databank of digitized biodiversity data: the global biodiversity information facility (GBIF). We compared such information with a compilation of independent distributional data from natural history collections and other sources. Location Europe. Methods We used data for the hawkmoths (Lepidoptera, family Sphingidae) to assess three aspects of range information: (1) observed range filling in 100  km ×  100  km grid cell squares, (2) observed European range extent and (3) observed climatic niche. Range extents were calculated as products of latitudinal and longitudinal extents. Areas derived from minimum convex polygons drawn onto a 2 -dimensional niche space representing the two main axes of a principal component analysis (PCA) were used to calculate climatic niche space.

40|$|Many {{questions}} of economic interest in structural VAR analysis involve estimates of multiple impulse response functions. Other questions {{relate to the}} shape of a given impulse response function. Answering these questions requires joint inference about sets of struc-tural impulse responses, allowing for dependencies across time as well as across response functions. Such joint inference is {{complicated by the fact that}} the joint distribution of the structural impulse response estimators becomes degenerate when the number of struc-tural impulse responses of interest exceeds the number of model parameters, as is often the case in applied work. This degeneracy may be overcome by transforming the estimator appropriately. We show that the joint Wald test is invariant to this transformation and converges to a nonstandard distribution, which can be approximated by the bootstrap, allowing the construction of asymptotically valid joint confidence sets for any subset of structural impulse responses, regardless of whether the joint distribution of the structural impulse responses is degenerate or not. We propose to represent the joint confidence sets in the form of ”shotgun plots ” rather than joint confidence bands for impulse response functions. Several empirical examples demonstrate that this approach not only conveys the same information as confidence bands about the statistical significance of response functions, but may be used to provide economically <b>relevant</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> about the shape of and comovement across response functions that is lost when reducing the joint confidence set to two-dimensional bands...|$|E
