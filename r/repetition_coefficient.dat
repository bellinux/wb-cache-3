40|$|Nowadays, in {{addition}} to implement the quality of management systems and environment management and due {{to the effects of}} safety and health issues on working processes, the organizations have also sought to acquire health and safety management systems. This descriptive –analytic and past reviewing study has been implemented based on five years (from 2006 to 2010) recorded documents and statistics information in food industrial. Information was collected based on the food industries checklists. The safety indices including risk evaluation, safety auditing, personnel safety training, investment in personal protection equipments, accident severity, accident frequency, accident frequency-severity and job decease <b>repetition</b> <b>coefficient</b> were used for determination of safety programs successfulness degree. Productivity indices such as human forces productivity, wastage amount, production per capita, personnel absence, personnel complaint and production exploitation were for organizational productivity measurements. The results showed that the safety programs implementation have positive impacts on mentioned productivity indices. So there was a direct relationship between safety rules respect and work condition optimization which arouse productivity development in the organizations. Indices definition could be helpful for the safety system effectiveness and system continuous performance optimization...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} genetic correlations of agronomic traits and to evaluate direct and indirect effects, through path analysis, between variables analyzed with grain yield. Forty accessions of common bean, cultivated at Caceres County were evaluated, by using randomized complete blocks design with three <b>repetitions.</b> <b>Coefficient</b> magnitudes of genotypic correlations were superior to phenotypic and environmental ones for most correlations, suggesting greater influence of genetic factor than environmental factors. In order to determine the importance of direct and indirect effects, path analysis was performed, which provided greater reliability in interpretations of cause and effect between studied traits, indicating that grain yield may be explained by the effects of analyzed traits. Number of seeds per plant (0. 801) and grain weight (0. 641) showed higher favorable effect over grain yield, allowing its use in direct or indirect selection for grain yield in common bean...|$|R

40|$|In {{the case}} of magnetocardiography (MCG), gradiometry is a {{commonly}} used method to reduce environmental noise. Here, {{the balance of the}} gradiometer {{is one of the main}} parameters determining the achievable noise reduction. In earlier work, we reported the use of frequency dependent gradiometer coefficients to effectively balance a gradiometer consisting of signal and reference sensors. In this work, the advantages of adaptive determination of these coefficients during a measurement without perturbing the MCG signal are investigated. MCG measurements were recorded with first and second order high temperature SQUID gradiometers inside and outside magnetic shielding. It will be shown that the heart signal is not distorted by applying our software noise reduction technique. Furthermore, by recalculation of gradiometer coefficients during the MCG measurement, an improved signal-to-noise ratio is achieved. The optimum <b>repetition</b> time for <b>coefficient</b> recalculation is determined...|$|R
40|$|Up to our knowledge-since about 126 {{years we}} were lacking of {{classical}} type combinatorial interpretation of Fibonomial coefficients {{as it was}} Lukas [1]- to our knowledge-who was the first who had defined Finonomial coefficients and derived a recurrence for them (see Historical Note in [2]). Namely as accurately noticed by Knuth and Wilf in [3] the recurrent relations for Fibonomial coefficients appeared already in 1878 Lukas work [1] and in our opinion- Lucas Thorie des Fonctions Numriques Simplement Priodiques is the far more non-accidental context for binomial and binomial-type coefficient- Fibonomial coefficients included. II. Recently [4] Kwa´sniewski combinatorial interpretation of Fibonomial coefficients has been proposed in the spirit [2] of the historically classical standard interpretations according to the schematic correspondences: SETS —SUBSETS (without and with <b>repetitions)</b> — Binomial <b>coefficient</b> —i. e. {{we are dealing with}} LATTICE of subsets SET PARTITIONS: Stirling numbers of the second kind — number o...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} with the above object was performed on 77 boys and 61 girls in the sixth year class (11 - 12 years old) of Ako primary school for 4 months. The memory was examined with 10 series of vocabularies and 8 series of numbers. The following results were obtained. 1) The auditory memory of girls was generally superior to that of boys; it was especially the case with regard to memorising numbers. 2) The coefficient of recall increased with <b>repetition,</b> viz., the <b>coefficient</b> was greater at the second time of recalling than the first, the third time still greater. 3) There is some difference in the memory capacity of the two sexes; namely, girls showed greater ability in memorising numbers than vocabulary, but boys showed no remarkable difference in either. 4) The first and the last items in one series were more easily recollected than the intermediate ones and this was still true after the lapse of a long interval of time. Mistakes in order occurred more frequently {{in the middle of}} one series. 5) Mistakes due to transposition of items in the series were most frequent. 6) Forgetting was a less frequent cause of error than transposition, and the introduction of wrong words into a series, the least noticeable of all. 7) There appeared to be little correlation between the powers of the memory and the marks gained in lessons...|$|R
