2500|$|Early {{maps of the}} Metropolitan and District {{railways}} were city maps {{with the}} lines superimposed, and the District published a pocket map in 1897. A Central London Railway <b>route</b> <b>diagram</b> appears on a 1904 postcard and 1905 poster, similar maps appearing in District Railway cars in 1908. In the same year, following a marketing agreement between the operators, a joint central area map that included all the lines was published. A new map was published in 1921 without any background details, but the central area was squashed, requiring smaller letters and arrows. Harry Beck had the idea of [...] expanding this central area, distorting geography, and simplifying the map so that the railways appeared as straight lines with equally spaced stations. He presented his original draft in 1931, and after initial rejection it was first printed in 1933. Today's tube map is an evolution of that original design, and the ideas are used by many metro systems around the world.|$|E

50|$|In {{planning}} for the Danube Valley Railway there was disagreement to begin with about the precise route it should take. The towns of Kelheim and Abensberg both wanted to be directly on the railway. The Kelheim option would have involved {{the construction of an}} expensive tunnel; as a result, Abensberg eventually won the day. As compensation a 5.5 km long stub line was built between Saal and Kelheim, that was ceremoniously opened on15 February 1875. From the terminus at Kelheim a spur ran off to the port to a location known in the route description as Kelheim Donauumschlagstelle (Kelheim Danube transhipment point).

5000|$|The {{station was}} close to the [...] station of the Midland Railway (MR), which was about 40 yards to the north on a {{parallel}} track. Both the MR line through Clowne and Barlborough station and the LD&ECR line through Clowne South continued westwards under adjacent road bridges then through deep cuttings, which ran parallel for several hundred yards. The MR line then went downhill and the LD&ECR went uphill, enabling it to swing northwest and cross the Midland line near the branch to Barlborough Colliery. After this it dropped steeply to the Rother valley via Spinkhill Tunnel. The line through Clowne South was closed to all traffic on 9 January 1967 when a new connection to what is now the Robin Hood Line was opened south of Creswell. This also allowed the line to be severed near Barlborough in connection with the northern extension of the M1 motorway. All tracks through the station were subsequently lifted. This change is shown in the <b>route</b> <b>diagrams</b> associated with the Beighton Branch article.|$|R

During the 1820s, Riepl again made study trips through the Inner Austrian and Illyrian provinces of the Austrian monarchy; it was from him that the initiative came to quarry the Styrian Erzberg using open cast mining. He also assisted the Austrian State Chancellor Prince Klemens von Metternich establishing iron works on his estates in Plasy, Bohemia. With the support of the Olomouc Cardinal Archduke Rudolf of Austria, he also worked as a surveyor at the Friedland (Frýdlant) mines in Moravia. In 1829 he gave the impulse for building the important Witkowitz iron works nearby, where he introduced the English puddling process. As early as 1828 Riepl had developed plans for a railway network across the whole Austrian Empire, including the later Southern Railway as well as a railway link from the Kingdom of Galicia via Vienna to the Port of Trieste. In 1830 he presented detailed <b>route</b> <b>diagrams</b> of a railway line running from Vienna to the Witkowitz iron works and further eastwards to the Wieliczka Salt Mine near Kraków. In the following years, he travelled to England several times to study the construction of railway lines. Receiving large funds by Salomon Mayer von Rothschild, his plans were finalised: backed by Chancellor Metternich and the Bohemian [...] "stadtholder" [...] Franz Anton von Kolowrat-Liebsteinsky, Riepl and Rothschild received the commission for the building of the Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway line (Nordbahn) from Vienna to Bochnia. Construction began in 1937, the line up to Bohumín (Oderberg) in Austrian Silesia was completed in 1847. One year later, a connection to the Prussian Upper Silesian Railway; a transport link to Kraków was provided by the Eastern National Railway from 1856.|$|R

At present, the Arctic route navigation safety environment is the main factor that affects {{the passage of the}} Arctic route, so this paper mainly analyzes the development of the navigation safety environment of the Arctic route. First of all, using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process to analyze the influence factors of the navigation safety of the Arctic <b>route,</b> the structure <b>diagram</b> of the navigation safety system of the Arctic route is divided. Secondly, according to the characteristics of navigation safety system of the Arctic route, entropy theory and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process are used to calculate the entropy values of navigation safety of Arctic routes, and the evolvement trend of navigation safety of Arctic routes is obtained. Finally, through the analysis of the trend of the Arctic route navigation security, some management countermeasures are put forward for the navigation safety of the Arctic route.

40|$|The strong {{correlation}} between {{the mass of the}} central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and the bulge in some galaxies and quasars implies that the formation of the black hole is somehow linked to the bulge. The measurement of metallicity by NV/CIV or NV/HeII in quasars allows to discuss a possible way of formation of the black hole. In this Letter we trace the metallicity along the possible <b>routes</b> in Rees' <b>diagram</b> in order to test the ways by which SMBHs can form. We derive a relation between the metallicity and the mass of the SMBH as Z∝ M_BH based on the numerical simulation of the evolution of star clusters. It is in good agreement with the relation determined by the metallicity measured by NV/CIV or NV/HeII in Hamann & Ferland's sample. This lends observational support to the formation of SMBHs via routes R 4 or R 5, namely, the evolution of dense star clusters.

50|$|After the 1921 British reconnaissance, {{attempts}} to climb Everest had been from Tibet because Nepal {{was closed to}} foreign climbers. Then, in 1950, Tibet's borders were closed when it was occupied by the People's Republic of China {{and by that time}} no expedition had been able to reach the summit. Partly on account of the political situation in Tibet, Nepal started allowing climbers entry in 1950 although it closed its frontiers again in 1966. During the period 1950-1966 three ridge routes were pioneered to reach the summit - the South Col—Southeast Ridge (1953), West Ridge—Hornbein Couloir (1963) and by a Chinese team via the North Col—North Ridge (1960). However, no summit attempt had been made on routes up any of Everest's faces. Nepal again allowed entry to climbers in 1969 and the Southwest Face, the only face accessible from Nepal, was such an attractive objective that Japan immediately mounted a spring reconnaissance in that year and returned in the autumn with a larger party with several climbers reaching 8000 m on a line striking left from the central gully (black—cyan <b>route</b> on the <b>diagram</b> below).|$|R
40|$|The {{thesis is}} focused on two major subjects: - Calculation of free energy is of great help {{in the study of}} any {{molecular}} system. The free energy determines phase behaviour of colloids and polymer solutions. It also controls the conformational properties of single macromolecules, e. g. DNA, proteins, copolymers. One of the most robust computer simulation techniques for free energy estimation is an Expanded Ensemble approach which is used throughout all the present work. Starting with a simple lattice polymer model, we develop and test an iterative procedure that makes the method automatic and accurate. Then we apply it to various polymer systems. The ideas behind a few similar approaches for overcoming rough free energy barriers lead to a non-equilibrium simulation method that yields e. g. the Gibbs free energy profile, G(V) =F(V) +pV. The latter is a direct <b>route</b> to phase <b>diagrams</b> which are invaluable when studying a thermodynamic system. This way we investigate the phase behaviour of constrained polymer systems. - Surface force calculation: another application of the expanded ensemble is to equalize the chemical potential of a polymer solution confined to a planar pore while changing its width. Forces acting along and perpendicular to the surfaces are then obtained by usual means of statistical mechanics and from the thermodynamic relations, the surface free energy in particular. A number of different polymer systems were dealt with in this framework...|$|R
