40|$|The {{development}} of new structural damage detection methods is {{of great interest to}} the aerospace industry. Current detection techniques rely on experiences with similar vehicles operating in similar conditions and require disassembly and part-by-part inspection. While effective, these methods can be costly, inefficient, and unnecessary if the aircraft is not in danger of structural failure. It is imagined that future aircraft will utilize non-destructive evaluation methods, allowing for the near real-time monitoring of structural integrity. A particularly interesting method involves utilizing the unique transformation response of shape memory alloy (SMA) particles embedded in an aircraft structure. By detecting changes in the mechanical and/or electromagnetic responses of embedded particles, operators could detect the formation or propagation of fatigue cracks in the vicinity of these particles. This work seeks to demonstrate the ability of SMA sensory particles to detect structural damage using a computational approach. For the first time, sensory particle response to local damage is demonstrated using finite element modeling. This model, based on an experimental demonstration, allows for the determination of sensory particle material properties by matching experimental data to finite element simulations. The result is then used to predict particle response to a propagating crack in the <b>root</b> <b>rib</b> of an aircraft wing using finite element analysis. In particular, this model utilizes substructure modeling to maintain computational efficiency while relating globally applied loads to local structural response. Finally, this work examines whether sensory particles can be used to approximate the location of structural damage by interpolating a stress field based on the responses of sensory particles in the vicinity of a propagating crack...|$|E
40|$|Wing joint {{design is}} one of the most {{critical}} areas in aircraft structures. Efficient and damage tolerant wing-fuselage integration structure, applicable to the next generation of transport aircraft, will facilitate the realisation of the benefits offered by new aircraft concepts. The Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft concept represents a potential revolution in subsonic transport efficiency for large airplanes. Studies have shown the BWB to be superior to conventional airframes in all key measures. Apart from the aerodynamic advantages, the BWB aircraft also provides a platform for wing-fuselage design changes. The main objective of this research is to design a damage tolerant wing-fuselage joint with a novel bird’s mouth termination for a BWB aircraft that has a similar payload range to the B 767 aircraft. The damage tolerance analysis of the proposed BWB wing/fuselage integration structure includes assessments of fatigue crack growth life, residual strength and inspection capability. The proposed structure includes a bird’s mouth termination of the spars that facilitates smooth transfer of loading from the spar web into the <b>root</b> <b>rib</b> and the upper and lower skins and is novel in its application to the blended wing body configuration. A finite element analysis was required to determine local stresses for the prediction of fatigue crack growth life, residual strength and inspection capability and to identify weak spots in the proposed structure. The project aircraft wing comprises of three spars (front, centre and rear) and a false rear spar thus defining a four cell wing box. Wing root shear, bending moment and torque loads were derived and applied to a thin-walled three box idealisation of the proposed structure. The challenges experienced in replicating the loads obtained from the three box idealisation were addressed by modification of the boundary conditions. Checks for compression and shear buckling were also undertaken that confirmed that the applied loads were below the limits of the proposed structure. The finite element analysis showed very clearly that the stresses in the novel bird’s mouth spar termination were significantly lower than in the skin and that the skin remained the more critical damage tolerant component at the wing root when the structure was subjected to ultimate design stresses. The spar web at the bird’s mouth termination was shown to have a larger crack growth life compared to the skin. The thickness of the skin requires further investigation as a significant amount of local bending was experienced due to the applied pressure. The skin will sustain a two-bay crack at the design limit load thus proving the proposed wing fuselage integration structure to be damage tolerant. In conclusion, the main objective of the thesis has been achieved. An integrated wingfuselage joint with novel bird’s mouth spar termination and surrounding structure have been designed and substantiated (evaluated) by damage tolerance requirements.

40|$|Polar {{transport}} of the auxin indole- 3 -butyric acid (IBA) {{has recently been}} shown to occur in Arabidopsis (Arabidopis thaliana) seedlings, yet the physiological importance of this process {{has yet to be}} fully resolved. Here we describe the first demonstration of altered IBA transport in an Arabidopsis mutant, and show that the resistant to IBA (rib 1) mutation results in alterations in growth, development, and response to exogenous auxin consistent with an important physiological role for IBA transport. Both hypocotyl and root IBA basipetal transport are decreased in <b>rib</b> 1 and <b>root</b> acropetal IBA transport is increased. While indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) transport levels are not different in rib 1 compared to wild type, root acropetal IAA transport is insensitive to the IAA efflux inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid in rib 1, as is the dependent physiological process of lateral root formation. These observed changes in IBA transport are accompanied by altered rib 1 phenotypes. Previously, <b>rib</b> 1 <b>roots</b> were shown to be less sensitive to growth inhibition by IBA, but to have a wild-type response to IAA in <b>root</b> elongation. <b>rib</b> 1 is also less sensitive to IBA in stimulation of lateral root formation and in hypocotyl elongation under most, but not all, light and sucrose conditions. rib 1 has wild-type responses to IAA, except under one set of conditions, low light and 1. 5 % sucrose, in which both hypocotyl elongation and lateral root formation show altered IAA response. Taken together, our results support a model in which endogenous IBA influences wild-type seedling morphology. Modifications in IBA distribution in seedlings affect hypocotyl and root elongation, as well as lateral root formation...|$|R

40|$|External {{post-tensioning}} is {{an attractive}} technique for strengthening reinforced concrete structures because {{of its ability to}} actively control stresses and deflections, speed of installation, minimum interruption for the existing structure, and ease of inspection under service conditions. However, external prestressing implies exposing the tendons to the environment outside the concrete section, which may lead to corrosion in steel tendons. Therefore, the interest in using fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) tendons, which are corrosion resistant, has increased. The present work investigated, experimentally and analytically, the flexural performance of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with externally post-tensioned Carbon FRP (CFRP) tendons, under monotonic and fatigue loadings. Initially, tensile fatigue tests were carried out on CFRP tendon-anchor assemblies to assess their response under repeated cyclic loads, before implementing them in the beam tests. New wedge-type anchors (Waterloo anchors) were used in gripping the CFRP specimens. The assemblies exhibited excellent fatigue performance with no premature failure occurring at the anchorage zone. The fatigue tests suggested a fatigue limit of a stress range of 10 % of the tendon ultimate capacity (approximately 216 MPa). Monotonic and fatigue experiments on twenty-eight beams (152 x 254 x 3500 mm) were then undertaken. Test parameters included the tendon profile (straight and double draped), the initial loading condition of the beam prior to post-tensioning (in-service and overloading), the partial prestressing ratio (0. 36 and 0. 46), and the load ranges applied to the beam during the fatigue life (39 % to 76 % of the yield load). The CFRP tendons were post-tensioned at 40 % of their ultimate capacity. The monotonic tests of the post-tensioned beams suggested that overloading the beam prior to post-tensioning increased the beam deflections and the strains developed in the steel reinforcing bars at any stage of loading. However, overloading had no significant effect on the yield load of the strengthened beam and the mode of failure at ultimate. It also had no discernable effect on the increase in the tendon stress at yielding. The maximum increase in the CFRP stress at yield load was approximately 20 % of the initial post-tensioning stress, for the in-service and overloaded beams. A very good performance of the strengthened beams was observed under fatigue loading. The fatigue life of the beams was mainly governed by the fatigue fracture of the internal steel reinforcing bars at a flexural crack location. Fracture of the bars occurred at the <b>root</b> of a <b>rib</b> where high stress concentration was likely to occur. No evidence of wear or stress concentration were observed at the deviated points of the CFRP tendons due to fatigue. The enhancement in the fatigue life of the strengthened beams was noticeable at all load ranges applied. Post-tensioning considerably decreased the stresses in the steel reinforcing bars and, consequently, increased the fatigue life of the beams. The increase in the fatigue life was slightly affected by the loading history of the beams. At the same load range applied to the beam, increasing the amount of the steel reinforcing bars for the same post-tensioning level decreased the stress range in the bars and significantly increased the fatigue life of the strengthened beams. In the analytical study, a monotonic model that predicts the non-linear flexural response of the CFRP post-tensioned beams was developed and implemented into a computer program. The model takes into account the loading history of the strengthened beams prior to post-tensioning (in-service and overloading). Good agreement was obtained between the measured and the predicted monotonic results. A strain-life based fatigue model was proposed to predict the fatigue life of the CFRP post-tensioned beams. The model takes into consideration the stress-strain history at the stress raisers in the steel bars. It accounts for the inelastic deformation occurring at the ribs during cycling and the resulting changes in the local mean stresses induced. Good agreement between the experimental and predicted fatigue results was observed. A step-by-step fatigue design approach is proposed for the CFRP externally post-tensioned beams. General conclusions of the study and recommendations of future work are given...|$|R
