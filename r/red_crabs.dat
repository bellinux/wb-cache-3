25|$|Grazers {{as well as}} browsers, the chital mainly feed on grasses {{throughout}} the year. They prefer young shoots, {{in the absence of}} whose tall and coarse grasses will be nibbled off at the tips. Browse forms a major portion of the diet only in the winter months-October to January-when the grasses, tall or dried up, are no more palatable. Browse includes herbs, shrubs, foliage, fruits and forbs; Moghania species are often preferred while browsing. Fruits eaten by chital in the Kanha National Park (Madhya Pradesh, India) include those of Ficus species from January to May, Cordia myxa from May to June, Syzygium cumini from June to July. Individuals tend to group together and forage while moving slowly. Chital are generally silent when grazing together. Males often stand on their hindlegs to reach tall branches. Water holes are visited nearly twice daily, with great caution. In the Kanha National Park, mineral licks rich in calcium and phosphorus pentoxide were scraped at by the incisors. Chital in the Sunderbans may be omnivores; remains of <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> have been found in the rumen of individuals.|$|E
25|$|Christmas Island is {{well known}} for its {{biological}} diversity. There are many rare species of animals and plants on the island, making nature-walking a popular activity. Along with the diversity of species, many different types of caves exist, such as plateau caves, coastal caves, raised coastal caves and alcoves, sea caves, fissure caves, collapse caves and basalt caves; most of these are near the sea and have been formed by the action of water. Altogether, there are 46 caves on the island, with Lost Lake Cave, Daniel Roux Cave and Full Frontal Cave being the most well-known. The many freshwater springs include Hosnies Spring Ramsar, which also has a mangrove stand. The Dales is a rainforest {{in the western part of}} the island and consists of seven deep valleys, all of which were formed by spring streams. Hugh's Dale waterfall is part of this area and is a popular attraction. The annual breeding migration of the <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> is a popular event. Fishing is another common activity. There are many distinctive species of fish in the oceans surrounding Christmas Island. Snorkeling and swimming in the ocean are two other activities that are extremely popular. Walking trails are also very popular, for there are many beautiful trails surrounded by extravagant flora and fauna. 63% of the island is national park making it one of the main attractions to experience when visiting.|$|E

50|$|Like most land crabs, <b>Red</b> <b>crabs</b> use gills {{to breathe}} and must take great care to {{conserve}} body moisture. Although <b>Red</b> <b>crabs</b> are diurnal, they usually avoid direct sunlight {{so as not to}} dry out. Despite lower temperatures and higher humidity, <b>Red</b> <b>crabs</b> are almost completely inactive at night. <b>Red</b> <b>crabs</b> also dig burrows to shelter themselves from the sun and will usually stay in the same burrow through the year. During the dry season, they will cover the entrance to their burrows with a loose wad of leaves to maintain high humidity in their burrow and will virtually disappear for 3 months until the start of the wet season. Apart from their breeding season, <b>Red</b> <b>crabs</b> are solitary animals and will defend their burrow from intruders.|$|E

50|$|One {{environmental}} parameter {{that requires}} regulatory {{function of the}} <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> is the season due to the temperature change. Mature female <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> must remain in warmer water (near 4 °C) to ensure the eggs {{will be ready for}} hatching, while the male <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> stay in relatively cold water (near 1.5 °C) to conserve energy output. In spring (May), female <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> move to shallow coastal areas to moult and spawn, and males join the females in the shallow water prior to moulting. In the summer (mid-June through mid-November), these crabs spend their time in fairly deep water, below established summer thermocline. When the thermocline breaks down, the <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> migrate back to intermediate depths where they remain until the female <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> release the eggs fertilized in the previous spawning.|$|R

50|$|Robber crabs, <b>red</b> <b>crabs,</b> {{and blue}} crabs are {{completely}} wiped out from infested areas. Populations of other ground and canopy dwelling animals, such as reptiles and other leaf litter fauna, have also decreased. During crab migrations, many crabs move through areas infested with ants and are killed. Studies {{show that the}} ant has displaced an estimated 15-20 million crabs by occupying their burrows, killing and eating resident crabs, and using their burrows as nest sites. This factor has greatly depleted <b>red</b> <b>crabs,</b> and made their annual land migrations far more perilous.|$|E
50|$|The eggs {{released}} by the females immediately hatch upon contact with sea water and clouds of crab larvae will swirl near the shore until they are swept out to sea, where they remain for 3-4 weeks. During this time, the larvae go through several larval stages, eventually developing into shrimp-like animals called megalopae. The megalopae gather near the shore for 1-2 days before changing into young crabs only 5 mm across. The young crabs then leave the water to make a 9-day journey to {{the centre of the}} island. For {{the first three years of}} their lives, the young crabs will remain hidden in rock outcrops, fallen tree branches and debris on the forest floor. <b>Red</b> <b>crabs</b> grow slowly, reaching sexual maturity at around 4-5 years, at which point they begin participating in the annual migration. During their early growth phases, <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> will moult several times. Mature <b>red</b> <b>crabs</b> will moult once a year, usually in the safety of their burrow.|$|E

40|$|The <b>red</b> land <b>crab,</b> Gecarcoidea natalis, {{which is}} endemic to Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean, has an obligate marine larval phase. Surface {{plankton}} tows, using a 500 um mesh net, were completed monthly at three {{sites on the}} north coast of Christmas Island to determine the composition, abundance and seasonal variation of the macro-zooplankton and detect the presence of <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> zoea larvae. The highest plankton concentrations were found {{at the end of}} the southeast monsoon period and, at all other times of the year, plankton settled volumes were very low, typically ≤ 0. 1 ml/m 3 of water sampled.

50|$|Overall, the <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> {{have a high}} {{adaptation}} {{capacity in}} changes of salinity level because the crabs retain their vital functions and also their feeding locomotor activities. However, {{there is a difference}} in the salinity tolerance between juvenile <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> and adult <b>red</b> king <b>crabs.</b> Juvenile <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> are slightly more tolerant to low concentrations of salinity because the juvenile's volume regulation is significantly better. Juveniles are consistently hyposmotic to the seawater because they have lower sodium concentration in their hemolymph. Due to the smaller size of the juveniles their exoskeleton is structurally more rigid. The adult <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> are hyperosmotic in high salinity and becomes hyposmotic in lower salinity. The hyperosmoticity is due to the higher sodium and potassium concentrations in the hemolymph compared to the surrounding water they live in.|$|R

40|$|Mortality of {{demersal}} fish eggs caused by predation {{was investigated in}} this research project.

Both capelin and lumpsucker are commercially important species in the Norwegian fisheries, but capelin {{is also a very}} important forage fish for other species. The egg guarding lumpsucker male was not able to protect his eggs from the egg feeding <b>red</b> king <b>crab.</b> Approximately 8 % of the analysed <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> stomachs contained lumpsucker eggs in 2003. In 2005 and 2006, capelin eggs occurred in 10 % and 23 % of the analysed <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> stomachs and capelin in 82 % and 22 % respectively. As post-spawn capelin occurred more frequently in crab stomachs than capelin eggs, they might have served as alternative prey to capelin eggs. Average stomach evacuation time for lumpsucker in <b>red</b> king <b>crabs</b> was higher than for capelin eggs. Consumption estimates of capelin eggs in <b>red</b> king <b>crab</b> accounted for 0. 04 % and 2. 23 % of the eggs available in the years of study, while the minimum estimated mortality due to egg cannibalism in capelin accounted for 1 - 2 % of the total egg production in 2003. The uncertainty in stomach data generated most of the uncertainty in the Monte Carlo estimated consumption of fish eggs by the <b>red</b> king <b>crab.</b> This study has established new knowledge about fish egg predation by the invasive red king and egg cannibalism in capelin.

Most of the research has been conducted on <b>red</b> <b>crab.</b> Four aspects of its biology have been examined in some detail, namely its reproduction, growth, movements and causes of its specific dep t h zonation off Namibia. These (particularly the first two) aspects have been used, together with information from commercial sampling and catch statistics, to examine possible changes in the yield-per-recruit should the age at first capture be increased, or fishing effort reduced. On the basis of these results, some management options are presented. Several techniques (photography, trawling, effective fishing area and tag-recapture) have been used to examine the abundance and density of <b>red</b> <b>crab</b> off Namibia, and are critically compared. Research on the stone crab has been largely restricted to an analysis of commercial catch data, though an unusual symbiotic relationship with a liparid fish has been identified and discussed...|$|R
