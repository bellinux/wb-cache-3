40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines has {{attempted}} to use ultrasonic signal travel-time measurements to measure loaded <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> strains. The strain measurements are then related to <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> loads through equations or empirical calibrations. Such techniques offer the potential of accurate, rapid bolt load measurement that does not disturb the anchotage. This report presents 6 e research findings for {{a specific type of}} ultrasonic measurement instrument using a pulsed-phase-Iock-Ioop technique. This technique measures signal travel time indirectly by measuring frequency changes. A complete development of the applicable theory and detailed derivations of key equations is presented along with empirical laboratory and field results. The differences between anticipated and measured behaviors are analyzed and discussed. The report identifies problems encountered in applying pulsed-phase-Iock-Ioop technology to <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> load measurement and provides potential solutions to many of them. A key assumption of pulsed-phase-lock-loop theory is that driving and reflected signal frequencies will always be equal. Findings showed that not only were actual frequencies not equal but they were not stable or simply related. Reflection wave shape also was not stable. The ramification of these findings and ways to minimize their adverse effects are presented...|$|E
40|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> is {{the most}} popular method for {{underground}} openings in the mining industry, especially in the bedded deposits such as coal, potash, salt etc. In fact, all U. S. underground coal mine entries are roof-bolted as required by law. However, roof falls still occur frequently in the <b>roof</b> <b>bolted</b> entries. The two possible reasons are: the lack of knowledge of and technology to detect the roof geological conditions in advance of mining, and lack of <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> design criteria for modern <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems. This research is to develop a method for predicting the roof geology and stability condition in real time during <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> operation. Based on such information, <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> design criteria for modern <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems will be developed for implementation in real time. A new mechanical approach to estimate rock strengths using the acquired drilling parameters has been proposed. This approach takes a number of important factors, that have never been studied in the previous researches, into the considerations.

40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} a human factors analysis of hazards associated with roofholting activities in underground coal mines. Emphasis {{was placed on}} hazards related to {{the movement of the}} drill-head boom or mast of a <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine. The objective was to identify hazards and recommend solutions. The data-collection effort consisted of analysis of U. S.

A set of recommendations to increase the safety of <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> operations was developed. In particular, the following list of recommendations was presented in ranking order: (1) use an interlock device to cut off power to controls when an operator is out of position, (2) place fixed barriers at pinch points, (3) provide appropriate control guarding, (4) reduce fast-feed speed, (5) use automatic cutoff switches at pinch points, (6) redesign control bank to conform to accepted ergonomic principles, and (7) use resin insertion tools and resin cartridge retainers...|$|R
40|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{significant}} development in coal mine ground control during the last century was the introduction of <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> during the late 1940 s and 1950 s. From an engineering standpoint, <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> are inherently {{more effective than the}} wood timbers they replaced. <b>Roof</b> <b>bolts</b> promised to dramatically reduce the number of roof fall accidents, which then claimed hundreds of lives each year, and they were initially hailed {{as one of the great}} social advances of our time. <b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> also emerged at a time of rapid technologic transformation of the coal industry, and greatly accelerated the transition to trackless, rubber-tired face haulage. The U. S. Bureau of Mines quickly became the new roof support s strongest advocate. Some state agencies and miners were skeptical at first, but nearly everyone was soon won over. Case histories were reported showing that roof falls could be largely eliminated while productivity increased dramatically. Little wonder that, in the words of one contemporary observer, <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> has been adopted more rapidly than any other new technology in the history of coal mine mechanization. Yet by the end of the 1950 s, it was clear that roof fall fatality incidence rates had actually increased. It would be another decade before the superior ground support provided by <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> would clearly save lives. The story of how <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> was implemented by the mining industry, but took so long to live up to its promise, is a fascinating example of the interaction between economics, technology, regulation, and science. It still has important lessons for today...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{more than}} half a century of {{experience}} with roof bolting, no design method has received wide acceptance. To begin to improve this situation, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a statistical study of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> performance at a number of mines throughout the U. S. Case histories were collected from 37 mines with a variety of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> types and patterns in a wide range of geologic environments. Performance was measured in terms of the number of roof falls that occurred per 10, 000 ft of drivage. The study found that roof falls are rare when the roof is strong and the stress is low, even with light roof bolting patterns. The focus of this paper is on the more difficult conditions, where the roof is weaker and/or the stress is higher. Analysis of the results led to guidelines that can be used to make preliminary estimates of the required bolt length, capacity, and pattern. The guidelines are based on the depth of cover (which correlates with stress) and the roof quality (measured by the Coal Mine Roof Rating (CMRR), and the intersection span. Another contribution is a formula for estimating the horizontal stress level in the eastern U. S. coalfields as a function of the depth of cover. The design guidelines are currently being implemented into a computer program called Analysis of <b>Roof</b> <b>Bolt</b> Systems (ARBS) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} assist in the {{evaluation}} and selection of roof bolts using in situ measurements of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> loading has been developed by researchers of the Spokane Research Center, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health. Both axial and bending forces are measured by strain gauges at many locations along the length of fully grouted bolts during various stages of mining. This information is then used to (1) predict bolt loading for variations in bolt spacing, grade, and diameter, (2) calculate the design changes necessary in zones where bending loads are high, and (3) determine if bolt length is adequate. Results from several case studies of full-column bolt loading in coal mine gate roads are used to illustrate the design method. This knowledge will give design engineers a tool for the selection of roof support systems that will improve underground safety by reducing <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> failures...|$|E

Despite research efforts dating back 50 years, no design methodology has found wide acceptance. This paper begins by identifying four mechanisms that roof bolts use to reinforce the ground. It argues that the reinforcement mechanism is determined by the roof geology and stress level, not by the type of bolt. Next, the attributes of roof bolts are discussed in the light of recent research, including anchorage mechanism, installed tension, length, capacity, timing of installation, and installation quality. Several significant areas of controversy are identified. Design methods from around the world are discussed, including those based on empirical research, numerical modeling, and roof monitoring. Finally, some simple guidelines for preliminary design of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> systems are proposed based on statistical analysis of roof support performance at 37 U. S. mines...|$|E
30|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> is {{the primary}} roof support system in US {{underground}} mines. <b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> usually consists two major processes: drilling and bolting. In the drilling process, a hole is drilled to the desired length into the mine roof at the required location. In the bolting process, bolts, either conventional bolts, cable <b>bolts</b> or resin <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> are inserted into the drilled hole for roof support. The fundamental problem of rock drilling is the breakage of fragments out of {{the face of a}} solid wall of rock (Teale 1965).

(Electrical and Electronic Engineering) The study {{investigated}} whether non-destructive impact testing, aided by {{supervised machine learning}} methods, {{could be used to}} identify improper <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> installations, related to insufficient grout coverage. The testing method involved the installation of four roof bolts, with varying installation properties, into a 1511 × 940 × 1350 mm rock test block. Three fully grouted bolts served as examples of proper installations, with the fourth bolt grouted only up to half the length of the borehole serving as an improper <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> installation. The testing procedure involved placing sensors directly onto the bolts and mechanically impacting a chosen bolt while measuring the response on all the bolts. The focus was on gaining understanding of the working principle of the testing technique and how the measured response was influenced by the presence of signal-modifying factors of the physical test block geometry, such as changes in material properties, boundary changes, cracks or empty boreholes. It was shown that the <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> integrity testing method aided by supervised machine learning methods could identify and classify both properly and improperly grouted roof bolts on the small sample of test bolts, in a series of tests conducted at the CSIR Centre for Mining Innovation premises.

40|$|<b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> {{typically}} {{follows the}} extraction of a commodity {{to help keep the}} roof from collapsing. During 2004 to 2013, roof bolter operators had the highest number of machinery-related injuries, accounting for 64. 7 percent, at underground coal mines. This paper analyzes U. S. roof bolter fatal and nonfatal lost-time injury data at underground work locations for all commodities from 2004 through 2013 and determines risk indices for six <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> tasks. For fatal and nonfatal incidences combined, the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were bolting, handling of materials, setting the temporary roof support (TRS), drilling, tramming, and traversing. For fatalities, the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> tasks in order of the highest to lowest risk index were handling of materials, setting the TRS, bolting, drilling, traversing, and tramming. Age was found to be a significant factor. Severity of injury, indicated by days lost, was found to increase with increasing age as well as with increasing experience, largely due to the confounding of age and experience. The operation of the <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine used in underground mining should be a research priority given the high frequency and severity of incidents. The results also suggest that temporal factors may exist, so additional research is warranted to better understand these factors and potentially develop interventions.

40|$|Information Circular (IC) 9453. Roof falls {{continue}} to be the greatest single safety hazard faced by underground coal miners. During 1996 - 99, 44 coal miners lost their lives in rock falls and nearly 2, 400 were injured. In addition, nearly 6, 000 noninjury roof collapses were reported. Roof supports are installed to protect the miners, but support system failures contributed to most of these incidents. Reducing the terrible toll taken by ground falls continues to be a major goal of research by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). During 2000 - 01, NIOSH conducted a series of open industry briefings on New Technology for Coal Mine Roof Support in Norton, VA, Charleston, WV, Evansville, IN, Tuscaloosa, AL, Price, UT, Glenwood Springs, CO, and Washington, PA. Drawing on many years of research undertaken by the NIOSH Pittsburgh and Spokane Research Laboratories, the proceedings describe what types of coal mine roof support are available, how they work, and when they should be used. The major subjects covered include roof bolts, standing roof supports, cable supports, and longwall shields. Some special topics are also addressed, including an analysis of roof fall accident statistics, techniques for better skin control, and material handling considerations. The proceedings volume also contains information on several important new technologies, which are described for the first time, e. g., guidelines for selecting <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> length, pattern, and capacity that were derived from statistical analysis of the roof fall experience at 37 underground mines; a new design method for longwall tailgate supports; and a technique for measuring loads developed within cable bolts.

40|$|It is arguable {{that the}} {{development}} of reinforcing roof bolting systems has largely stagnated in recent times primarily due to the prevailing industry view that few, if any further improvements can be made to {{the current state of the}} art. On the contrary, this paper will contend that reinforcing roof bolting systems can be further refined by considering both the specific manner by which horizontally bedded roof strata loses its natural self-supporting ability and the specific means by which reinforcing roof bolts act to promote or retain this natural self-supporting ability. The Australian coal industry’s seeming insistence on minimising bolt-hole diameter to maximise load transfer and targeting full-encapsulation by any means has led to a significant, albeit unintended consequence in terms of overall roof bolting effectiveness, namely the promotion of increased resin-pressures during bolt installation and the associated potential for the opening up of bedding planes that may otherwise remain closed during the bolt installation process. Given that the natural self-supporting ability of roof strata is strongly linked to whether bedding planes remain open or closed, it stands to reason that minimising resin pressures should be of significant benefit. Three issues are primarily focused on three key issues that relate directly to the function of the roof bolting system itself, namely: (i) the importance of proper resin mixing in the context of maximising load transfer strength and stiffness, (ii) the importance of minimising resin pressures developed during bolt installation and (iii) the importance of maximising the effectiveness of the available bolt pre-tension. The logic being that if: the reliability of resin mixing with varying hole diameter is substantially improved, if resin pressures generated during bolt installation are substantially reduced, if the length of the bolted interval directly influenced by high resin pressures generated during bolt installation is substantially reduced, and if <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> pre-tension levels are increased, why wouldn’t individual <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> effectiveness and thus roof reinforcement improve? The potential benefits to the mining industry of improving the individual effectiveness of each installed <b>roof</b> <b>bolt,</b> even by relatively small incremental amounts, should be of interest to all mine operators and is an important topic for discussion amongst the mining community...|$|E

The study evaluates {{the effectiveness of}} partial to full columns of resin in anchoring 4 -ft, No. 6, grade 40 rebar <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in potash, salt, trona, gypsum, and borate mine roofs. Pull tests were performed on over 600 <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in 11 evaporite mines. Column lengths ranging from 6 to 48 in (fully grouted) were evaluated for each test site. In general, comparative results among all test sites indicate that pull-out loads in excess of 10 tons (force) were attained with resin-grouted bolts having 13 to 75 pet less than a full column of polyester resin. Ten tons (force) of load-carrying capability compared favorably, in terms of strength, with the calculated yield strength of the rebar used in the tests, which was 8. 8 tons (force). The site-specific nature of each test site, due to the unique combinations of geology, mine-induced stresses, and other unknown parameters, prevented the establishment of valid generic column-length criteria. For these reasons, data to evaluate resin-column-length effectiveness are best obtained on a mine-specific basis...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{directed}} towards {{the comparison of}} active and passive bolts systems to reveal which system shows the most favorable behavior for improved performance, safety and cost. This was achieved through the incorporation of new technologies, field data, numerical modeling and established theories in ground control analysis. All in all, {{a better understanding of}} the quasi-static behavior of underground coal mine roofs has been attained. Over the summer of 2010, the Department of Mining and Mineral Resource Engineering at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, in conjunction with Andy Hyett of YieldPoint Inc., Peabody and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), installed over one hundred and seventy instrumented extensometers, closure meters, shear-meters, passive rebar <b>roof</b> <b>bolts,</b> tension rebar <b>roof</b> <b>bolts,</b> and double lock rebar <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> at three coal mines. Two of the three coal mines were room-and-pillar mines and the other a longwall mine. Data was routinely collected over a nine-month period to analyze shearing, dilation, and axial bolt loading occurring within the rock mass, and entry closure occurring between the excavation hanging-wall and foot-wall. Based on bolt loadings, shear, axial behavior and statistical analysis, initial results indicate that active <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> do not show superior performance for the added cost. Active bolts seem to show no difference from passive bolts in the initial loading phase either, indicating that tension bleed-off is a concern soon after installation; however, this observation was not captured, as the data loggers were not intrinsically safe. Considering the modeling results, the trends in axial loading seem to be calibrated but the magnitudes are not. Computer modeling also shows the potential to accurately model in situ bolt performance; however, challenges remain in obtaining a good match between numerical modeling and field observations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an analytical design method for the truss-bolt system in reinforcing underground fractured rock roofs in coal mines. The analytical design method {{is based on}} the mechanical analysis of the fractured rock roof with reinforcement by inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> and a horizontal tie-rod. The mechanical analysis for the system includes a non-linear bending model for the laterally inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> and three upper and lower bounds. The lateral resistance of the inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in a truss-bolt-supported roadway is examined using classical theory of a non-linear beam in bending. The paper analyses the arching action by lateral behavior of the inclined <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> in reinforcing the fractured roof. Based on mechanical models, the design formula concerning the lateral bolt forces, tensions in the tie-rod in the truss system, as well as the reinforcement behavior have been derived. In order to ensure that the roof truss-bolt system reinforces the coal roof effectively, a lower bound of pre-tightening forces must be applied on the tie-rod for stabilizing the fractured roof by arching action. The pre-tightening forces exerted via the tie-rod also cannot be greater than its upper bound, since the excessive tightening force will cause localized failure in the rock near the bolt tail at the abutment of the fractured roof beam. The analytical formulas for both lower and upper bounds for truss pre-tightening forces are put forward in this paper. Furthermore, the paper also {{presents an}}alytical equations for designing the axial forces and dimensions for bolts in this kind of system. Parametric studies and optimization analysis are also carried out {{on the basis of the}} proposed approach. A flow chart and procedures are presented to show the analytical design method for this truss-bolt system. Case studies are presented to show how the method can be used in actual coal mining tunnels.

In general, data from the Peabody mines show that ARBS predictions match well with field conditions. Peabody, however, does not use ARBS as the stand-alone methodology for support selection. Peabody uses a two-pronged approach in which the support requirement is initially estimated from the classification method, and then numerical modeling is used to select the proper reinforcement system. Such an integrated approach is necessary, as ARBS suggests only the amount of steel that may be used to support the roof and does not specify which type of <b>roof</b> <b>bolt</b> to use. A case study is used to demonstrate the usefulness of ARBS and Peabody s integrated approach to support design. Also, the application of ARBS at several Peabody mines showed a very good correlation with support cost. The correlation indicated a direct relation between bolting cost and the ARBS value...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} a laboratory investigation designed {{to evaluate the}} stress and deformation characteristics of fully grouted <b>roof</b> <b>bolts</b> subjected to various magnitudes of end loadings. The experiment and subsequent analysis were completed, utilizing axial deformation data obtained -ultrasonically from forty-one 4 -ft, grade 40 <b>roof</b> <b>bolts,</b> {{with a total of}} 132 measurement locations along the lengths of the bolts. The ultrasonic measurement instrumentation used in this investigation allowed for elongation measurements without requiring extensive bolt modifications. The results indicate that approximately 39 pct o{ the applied end load dissipated within the first 3. 4 in of the bolts. However, only 3 pct of the applied load was realized beyond 28 in of the grout column. Data are presented individually for every 6 -in increment of bolt length, and analysis was performed using statistical, nonlinear equations developed for 5, 000 and 8, 000 lb loading conditions...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) classifies {{hearing loss}} as a {{separate}} illness category. Hearing loss accounted for 11 % of all illnesses in 2005 (U. S. Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2006 a). According to occupational data for coal mining provided by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) from 2000 to 2005, operators that exceeded 100 % noise dosage were from only seven types of machines: auger miners, bulldozers, continuous mining machines, front end loaders, roof bolters, shuttle cars (electric) and trucks (Title 30 CFR Part 62, 2000 - 2005). <b>Roof</b> <b>bolting</b> machine operators rank second among all underground machine operators that exceed 100 % noise dose.

40|$|The International Ground Control Conference in Mining {{has always}} {{provided}} an open {{forum for the}} publication, presentation, discussion, and often heated debate on <b>roof</b> <b>bolting</b> systems mostly with attention to how, when, and why they work. During the last 24 Conferences at least 170 papers have been presented by International Experts on these simple devices that range in length from 30 -inches to 20 ft and from 5 / 8 to 2 inches in diameter. <b>Roof</b> <b>bolts</b> are primarily mechanically anchored, glued, cemented, or driven. Bolts are placed vertically, angled, or tied together with special fixtures (trusses and slings). They have been termed active, passive, stick-slip, and several other descriptive acronyms or mining slang expressions. This retrospective paper will present the changes in bolt types and usage, point {{out some of the}} biggest myths and hail the most significant advances (according to the authors opinions of course) ...|$|R
