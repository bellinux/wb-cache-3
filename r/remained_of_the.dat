5|$|The Great Southern Group {{dismantled}} {{much of what}} <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company. Frederick W. Paine was {{detached from}} the LNC, along with the specialist division overseeing the exhumation and relocation of existing burial grounds to allow property development on formerly consecrated sites. All that <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LNC was Brookwood Cemetery itself, by this time moribund and becoming heavily overgrown. Considered virtually worthless, Great Southern sold the LNC to property speculators Maximillian Investments in July 1973 for £400,000.|$|E
5|$|According {{to another}} legend, {{there was once}} a sea where the Dnieper River now flows. When Saint Andrew came to Kiev and erected a cross on the place where the Saint Andrew's Church now stands, the sea went away. The only part that <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sea is under the {{mountain}} on which Kiev sits today. When the church was built there in the 18th century, a spring opened under the altar. The church has no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell strikes, the water can revive again and flood the left bank of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|After Burgoyne's {{surrender}} on October 17, 1777 (part of {{the aftermath}} of the Saratoga Campaign), Ann Bleecker, her daughter and sister (all that <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family), and possibly a slave child returned to Tomhannock. Unfortunately, Caty Swits (1743–77) died during the return journey. Ann Bleecker was devastated by the loss of three generations of women in her family.|$|E

5|$|After the accident, {{souvenir}} hunters {{proved to}} be such a problem that the owners of Berry Brow kept all gates locked. Geoff Inkpen stated that after completion of an Inquiry a bulldozer would be used to dig a ditch at the crash site and what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Amana would be buried.|$|E
5|$|Alexander Stuart, an Army {{captain who}} served as the last {{governor}} of the castle, stripped down what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fortification in the mid-1700s. Some of the stone was reused to build the Bowling Green House – later renamed the Castle Inn – on {{the north end of the}} tennis courts, while the north side of the outer bailey was used to make the bowling green itself. Stuart lived in a house in Ludlow itself, but decorated the Great Hall with the remains of the castle armoury, and may have charged visitors for admittance.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some work}} was done to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light industrial use before they too fell into disuse. In the 1990s, the buildings fell victim to vandalism and arson that threatened to destroy what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site.|$|E

5|$|Another {{division}} among Christians occurred, when Leo III {{ordered the}} destruction of icons throughout the Empire. This led to a significant religious crisis, which ended in mid-9th century with the restoration of icons. During the same period, {{a new wave of}} pagans emerged in the Balkans, originating mainly from Slavic people. These were gradually Christianised, and by Byzantium's late stages, Eastern Orthodoxy represented most Christians and, in general, most people in what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire.|$|E
5|$|Between 21 and 23 September the Ottoman III Corps (Ottoman Seventh Army) {{fought a}} rearguard action from Tubas to the Jordan River, which delayed the British cavalry encirclement and enable what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Eighth Army and the Ottoman Seventh Army {{to retreat to}} {{the eastern side of}} the Jordan River.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 20 September, the Eighth Ottoman Army {{had been}} pushed {{back out of the}} coastal Plain of Sharon and the Desert Mounted Corps was {{blocking}} the Seventh and what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eighth Armies' main lines of retreat northwards. The 60th Division held Tulkarm and Anebta, the 7th (Meerut) Division held the village of Beit Lid and controlled the crossroads at Deir Sheraf, while the 5th Light Horse Brigade had cut the Jenin railway south of Arrabe. Both the 3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) Divisions had continued to force the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies' retreat.|$|E

5|$|Contrasted {{with the}} flourishing {{state of trade}} {{in the first half}} of the 19th century is the rapid and {{sustained}} decline during the second half. In the period of 40 years from 1841 to 1881, the population fell from 2836 to 1192, a loss of over 57%. By the end of the century, all that <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> major industries of the town was the malthouse of F.A. Waller & Co., while all smaller industries had vanished completely.|$|E
5|$|During {{the meeting}} in Kolwezi, Tshombe had ordered all {{remaining}} Katangese armed forces to withdraw to Portuguese Angola. Jean Schramme was appointed to be commander of an army in exile, while Jeremiah Puren was ordered to evacuate what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Katangese Air Force, along with necessary military equipment and the Katangese treasury. This was accomplished via air and railway. Rhodesian operatives assisted in smuggling the gold reserves out of the country. The last of Schramme's mercenaries and gendarmes were evacuated on 25 January. Other gendarmes spent the remainder of 1963 in Northern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Following Deadstick, the engineers, glider {{pilots and}} 'B' Company men were {{returned}} to their parent formations. 'D' Company played their part in the 6th Airborne Division's defence of the Orne bridgehead, and advance to the River Seine. On 5 September, when the division was withdrawn to England, all that <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> company were 40 men under the only remaining officer, Howard; the other officers, sergeants, {{and most of the}} junior NCOs having been among the casualties.|$|E

Daley proposed a 2010 budget totaling $6.14 billion, including spending $370 million from the $1.15 billion proceeds from the parking meter lease. In his annual budget address on October 13, 2010, Daley projected a deficit for 2010 of $655 million, the largest in city history. Daley proposed a 2011 budget totaling $6.15 billion, including spending all but $76 million of what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> parking meter lease proceeds, and received a standing ovation from aldermen.|$|E
5|$|Mstislav of Kiev {{arrived to}} see what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rus' army fleeing. With his {{contingent}} of 10,000 men, he retreated to his stockaded camp, on a hill by the Dnieper. The pursuing Mongol army caught up with Mstislav of Kiev's forces and started to besiege the camp.|$|E
5|$|The West {{responded with}} the Crusades, {{eventually}} {{resulting in the}} Sack of Constantinople by participants in the Fourth Crusade. The conquest of Constantinople in 1204 fragmented what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire into successor states, the ultimate victor being that of Nicaea. After the recapture of Constantinople by Imperial forces, the Empire {{was little more than}} a Greek state confined to the Aegean coast. The Roman Empire finally collapsed when Mehmed the Conqueror conquered Constantinople on 29 May 1453.|$|E

5|$|Throughout September 1973, Aman had {{received}} eleven warnings, including a warning from Jordan's King Hussein, that Egypt and Syria were bent on waging war, {{but they were}} all disregarded, as Aman maintained the belief that the Arabs would not launch an attack. Mossad director Zvi Zamir <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opinion that war was not an Arab option.|$|E
5|$|After {{a fire in}} 1177, the {{original}} palace complex was abandoned and emperors resided in smaller palaces (the former sato-dairi) within the city and villas outside it. In 1227 a fire finally destroyed what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dairi, and the old Greater Palace went into complete disuse. In 1334 Emperor Go-Daigo issued an edict to rebuild the Greater Palace, but no resources were available to support this and the project came to nothing. The present Kyoto Imperial Palace is located immediately {{to the west of}} the site of the , the great Fujiwara residence in the north-eastern corner of the city. The Jingi-kan, the final standing section of the palace, remained in use until 1585.|$|E
5|$|After a quiet {{period in}} February 1945 {{absorbing}} replacements, the division was {{withdrawn from the}} defensive line and ordered to recapture Trier from the US Army. This attack started on 7 March in freezing conditions but after limited success a fresh US offensive struck the division and forced them back north of Mainz. By 19 March, Raithel's regiment had {{been converted into a}} kampfgruppe (battlegroup) consisting of two gebirgsjäger battalions, a mountain artillery battalion, a pioneer company and eight anti-tank guns. Two weeks later they were fighting their way out of encirclement near Limburg. On 1 April 1945, Kampfgruppe Raithel and the rest of what <b>remained</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> division drove east. Shortly afterwards, Raithel received a serious head wound and was captured. The remnants of the division disintegrated {{over the next few days}} and weeks and were captured by the Americans.|$|E
