5|$|Occasionalism is {{the view}} espoused by Nicholas Malebranche that asserts that all {{supposedly}} causal relations between physical events, or between physical and mental events, are not really causal at all.

5|$|Similar to humans, gray wolves have facial color {{patterns}} {{in which the}} gaze direction can be easily identified, although this is often {{not the case in}} other canid species. In 2014, a study compared the facial color pattern across 25 canid species. The results suggested that the facial color pattern of canid species is <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> gaze communication, and that especially gray wolves use the gaze signal in conspecific communication.|$|E

Miami Vice received mixed reviews upon release; the game was mainly criticised due to its poor mechanics and graphics, though some reviewers praised the overall experience.|$|E

5|$|By contrast, {{the worker}} shares {{half of her}} genes with her sons and only a quarter with her brothers. Furthermore, the workers in colonies with a single once-mated queen are <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> nephews by three eighths, higher than they are related to brothers. This results in a {{conflict}} where the queen and worker females are at odds over the proportion of male offspring they contribute, since each side tries to maximize its reproductive fitness. Queens favor production of their own sons while workers favor production of their own sons, and do not stop their sisters from laying because of the favorable relatedness to nephews.|$|E
5|$|Each Clan has an {{identical}} hierarchical system. From birth, newborn kittens {{are known as}} ‘kits’, {{as evidenced by the}} ‘-kit’ suffix {{at the end of their}} name. Parents of the kits choose the names; often, a name is <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> appearance (‘Graykit’), an element of nature (‘Sandkit’), or in regards to how the parent felt when the kit was born (‘Brokenkit’). Mothers, known as ‘queens’, then look after their kits for their first six months of life. Kits are expected to stay in camp at all times, and sleep in a designated and comfortable area known as the ‘nursery’.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{analysis}} {{has shown that}} certain mallards appear {{to be closer to}} their Indo-Pacific relatives while others are <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> American relatives. Mitochondrial DNA data for the D-loop sequence suggests that mallards may have evolved in the general area of Siberia. Mallard bones rather abruptly appear in food remains of ancient humans and other deposits of fossil bones in Europe, without a good candidate for a local predecessor species. The large ice age palaeosubspecies that made up at least the European and west Asian populations during the Pleistocene has been named Anas platyrhynchos palaeoboschas.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, the UK anti-poverty fundraiser Comic Relief asked three best-selling British authors– cookery {{writer and}} TV {{presenter}} Delia Smith, Bridget Jones creator Helen Fielding, and Rowling– to submit booklets <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> most famous works for publication. Rowling's two booklets, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them and Quidditch Through the Ages, are ostensibly facsimiles of books {{found in the}} Hogwarts library. Since going on sale in March 2001, the books have raised £15.7million for the fund. The £10.8million they have raised outside the UK have been channelled into a newly created International Fund for Children and Young People in Crisis. In 2002 Rowling contributed a foreword to Magic, an anthology of fiction published by Bloomsbury Publishing, helping {{to raise money for}} the National Council for One Parent Families.|$|E
5|$|In wasps, as {{in other}} Hymenoptera, sex is {{determined}} by a haplodiploid system, which means that females are unusually closely <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> sisters, enabling kin selection to favour the evolution of eusocial behaviour. Females are diploid, meaning that they have 2n chromosomes and develop from fertilized eggs. Males have a haploid (n) number of chromosomes and develop from an unfertilized egg. Wasps store sperm inside their body and control its release for each individual egg as it is laid; if a female wishes to produce a male egg, she simply lays the egg without fertilizing it. Therefore, under most conditions in most species, wasps have complete voluntary control over the sex of their offspring. Experimental infection of Muscidifurax uniraptor with the bacterium Wolbachia induced thelytokous reproduction and an inability to produce fertile, viable male offspring.|$|E
5|$|Life for the blue-collar men of {{the port}} is {{increasingly}} hard and work is scarce. As union leader, Sobotka has taken it on himself to reinvigorate the port by lobbying politicians to support much-needed infrastructure improvement initiatives. Lacking the funds needed {{for this kind of}} influence, Sobotka has become involved with a smuggling ring. Around him, his son and nephew also turn to crime, as they have few other opportunities to earn money. It becomes clear to the Sobotka detail that the dead girls are <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> investigation, as they were in a container {{that was supposed to be}} smuggled through the port. They again use wiretaps to infiltrate the crime ring and slowly work their way up the chain towards The Greek, the mysterious man in charge. But Valchek, upset that their focus has moved beyond Sobotka, gets the FBI involved. The Greek has a mole inside the FBI and starts severing his ties to Baltimore when he learns about the investigation.|$|E

5|$|Mega Man 2 is a {{platform}} and action game like its predecessor, Mega Man. The player controls Mega Man as he traverses eight stages {{to defeat the}} bosses, Dr. Wily's Robot Masters: Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man, and Wood Man. Each Robot Master features a unique weapon and a stage <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> weapon's power. For example, Air Man shoots small tornadoes and is fought in a sky-themed level, while Wood Man can use a shield of leaves and is found in a forest-themed stage. After defeating a boss, their signature weapon becomes available to the player. The Robot Masters have weaknesses to the weapons of certain other Robot Masters; therefore, choosing {{the order in which}} the levels are played is a vital component of the gameplay. After completing certain stages, Mega Man receives a special item. These items create platforms that allow Mega Man to access areas that he otherwise could not.|$|E

Maryland has a voluntary legislator pension plan to which both Senators and Delegates have access. Besides receiving their own benefits, Senators can award up to $138,000 each year in scholarships to students of their choosing if those students meet requirements set by Senate rules.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} have {{hypothesized that the}} more rigid skull of Tarbosaurus was an adaptation to hunting the massive titanosaurid sauropods found in the Nemegt Formation, which {{did not exist in}} most of North America during the Late Cretaceous. The differences in skull mechanics also affect tyrannosaurid phylogeny. Tarbosaurus-like articulations between the skull bones are also seen in Alioramus from Mongolia, suggesting that it, and not Tyrannosaurus, is the closest relative of Tarbosaurus. Similarities between Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus might therefore be <b>related</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> large size, independently developed through convergent evolution.|$|E
