Ariful Islam Russell Abstract — Whether there is any framework or not, sometimes businesses grow and run into an economy. After a matured stage, the community starts developing the industry for their own good. Bangladesh has a very competitive market inside and also outside from its own pharmaceuticals industry, even where multinational organizations are facing many challenges to compete with local organizations. But in this matured stage how much indigenous technology they could <b>reveal</b> <b>out</b> from the system. Students are getting out from universities, but they’re not learning how to develop through research. They are becoming just operational workers. But through incubation and better investment, this situation can be improved. Besides this another threat is coming nearby to this industry. Patent rights valuation will make the local organizations weaker just because they are compounding the resources ignoring investments into molecule development. Several Active Pharmaceuticals Ingredients (APIs) are being produced here, but not in that large scale. To cope up with this situation government and DDA should come up some strategic plans to stand against future threats.

A total of 660 one-humped camels were randomly selected from different villages of Assiut, Upper Egypt. The animals were undergone clinical and parasitological examinations. Skin scrapings revealed that Sarcoptes scabiei var. cameli mite was present in 6. 06 % (n= 40 / 660) camels of the area. Statistical analysis of some ecological parameters showed that there was significant relationship (P< 0. 05) between mite infestation in camels and season, housing management, and use of acaricides. On the other hand, age and sex did not significantly affect the prevalence of the disease. Topical application of moxidectin at 0. 5 mg/kg bwt or subcutaneous administration of doramectin at 200 μg/kg bwt, along with treatment of animal environment was found to be the best protocol for the eradication and prevention of Sarcoptic mange in camel. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} Sarcoptes scabiei var cameli is the preeminent agent of mange infestation in one-humped camel in Upper Egypt. Use of acaricides for the treatment of affected camels, along with spraying the animal environment by insecticides is a effective protocol not only for controlling mange in camels but also for prevention of re-infestation from the animal environment...|$|E

Materials and methods: A questionnaire survey to know the behavioral parameters and management provisions provided by the farmers was designed to collect necessary information from Sirajganj and Gabtoli markets. The survey was conducted by direct interview with the stakeholders who were directly involved with the transportation of Black Bengal goats from Sirajganj to Dhaka city. Results: The present study showed that 58 % adult respondents were involved in goat transportation program, among them 95 % were male. Most of the farmers in the markets lacked institutional education (24 %) or just completed primary education (41 %). Only 27 % of the respondents had earlier experience in transporting animals. Transport durations were 6 h (10 %). The goats were usually transported on foot or by using vehicles. All the respondents were known about planning of animal transportation. About 2, 5, 7 and 5 % of animals were suffering from head swinging, stretching, stamping of feet and paralyzed condition during transportation, respectively. During transportation, the animals exhibited idleness (25 %), panting (17 %), foaming (14 %), vocalization (13 %) and moving forward (12 %). Most of the farmers provided feed (41 %), rest (33 %) and shelter (24 %) during the transportation of the goats. Only 5 % farmers hired trained drivers for transportation purpose. About 27 % animals were untied and 7 % animals ramped during transportation. Besides, there were high percentage of pressure to animals (23 %), hitting or kicking animals (19 %) and abuse to animals (15 %) during transportation. Conclusion: From this study it is concluded that Black Bengal goats became physically unfit during long time transportation although majority of the farmers took proper management practices. Therefore, changes in behavioral responses might be alleviated through creating awareness to animal raiser as well transporter. [J Adv Vet Anim Res 2016; 3 (1. 000) : 38 - 44...|$|E

Those who are preoccupied with any sort of profession are involved with professional association in their field of work by spending some part of their times and energies in order to find solutions for their problems. The purpose of this study, entitled as "The Obstacles Which Prevent the Development of the Turkish Librarians' Association", is to <b>reveal</b> <b>out</b> the legal, organizational and financial problems that prevent the development of the Turkish Librarians' Association (TLA), which is unique professional association in the field of librarianship in our country. This thesis makes use of "comparative method" as a research technique. As a start, the history of the liberty of establishing an association in Turkey and the laws related to associations are analysed thoroughly, after which, the histories, organizational structures, membership systems, financial statuses and the activities of the TLA and the Library Association are focused on separately, both of them being compared within the framework of the criteria presented above. The obstacles which prevent the development of the TLA and the results derived out of this comparative study are listed below: 1. The laws related to associations in Turkey are effecting the activities of professional associations in a negative sense, 2. The TLA has shortcomings from the view point of organizational structure; 3. No solutions for the financial problems of the Association are being put forward; 4 -. The amount of the number of members cannot be increased. Due to the reasons stated above, the activities of the TLA are limited and therefore it cannot perform its duties as a national library association. In the conclusion, in order to enable the TLA to solve its organizational and financial problems together with an increase in the number of its members, a reorganization as "Chamber of Librarians" is brought forth as a suggestion and by this way, how a solution for the problems may be found, is discussed...|$|E
