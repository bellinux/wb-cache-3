When there is a shortfall in household waste, non-hazardous industrial and commercial waste are used to make up capacity.

5|$|Waste is {{delivered}} to the station by road, using up to 100 waste collection vehicles. Up to 2,800 tonnes of waste a week or as much as 1,000 tonnes of waste a day, can be delivered at the plant. A rail head was also built on the railway sidings adjacent to the site in 2009. This allows for waste to be {{delivered to the}} plant by rail, rather than just by road. This is more sustainable as it reduces the amount of traffic on local roads. In December 2011, {{it was announced that}} the rail head would be used to receive up 500,000 tonnes of <b>residual</b> <b>waste</b> per year from Merseyside via a rail waste transfer facility at Knowley Industrial Park, Kirby, in a contract worth £400million.|$|E

In this work, the potential performance improvement gained by applying cognitive radio to multiple-provider wireless systems is investigated.

The X-ray diffraction analysis results, chemical and granulometric compositions of dust from the carbon ferrochrome production are given. The method for the production of chemical-enrichment concentrate (CEC) by processing ferrous dust is described, with obtaining a middling product - sodium mono-chromate with its further reduction to chromium hydroxide, followed by autoclave leaching, and resulting in the production of chemically enriched chrome concentrate.

Demand management, which includes accurate valuations of natural resources and increasing public awareness, is a valuable strategy to support sustainable consumption. This approach can also provide significant savings in infrastructure investment.

These technologies protect the environment, are less polluting, use resources in a sustainable manner, recycle more of their wastes and products and handle all <b>residual</b> <b>wastes</b> in a more environmentally acceptable way than the technologies for which they are substitutes.

50|$|The first {{occurrence}} of organised {{solid waste management}} system appeared in London in the late 18th century. A waste collection and resource recovery system was established around the 'dust-yards'. Main constituent of municipal waste was the coal ash (‘dust’) which had a market value for brick-making and as a soil improver. Such profitability encouraged dust-contractors to recover effectively 100% of the <b>residual</b> <b>wastes</b> remaining after readily saleable items and materials had been removed by the informal sector in the streets ('rag-and-bone men'). Therefore, this was an early example of organised, municipal-wide solid waste management. The dust-yard system had been working successfully up to middle 1850s, when {{the market value of}} ‘dust’ collapsed. It was important in facilitating a relatively smooth transition to an institutionalised, municipally-run solid waste management system in England.|$|R

Subsequently, the PIOT and related physical supply and use tables have been taken up in the System of Environmental and Economic Accounting [UN (United Nations), 2003. System of Environmental and Economic Accounting. United Nations, New York]. This paper reviews PIOTs for the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Italy, Finland and the European Union. These studies applied the 'basic' and 'extended' PIOT frameworks. This paper elaborates these frameworks with packaging, <b>residuals</b> (<b>wastes</b> and emissions), recycling and stock changes, {{in order to create a}} 'full' PIOT. The production process of the extended and full PIOT is split into structural and auxiliary production processes.

40|$|We seek to {{characterize}} {{the role of the}} exposure assessment in ensuring sustainably protective containment of residual contamination. Exposure assessment is placed in the context of secondary and tertiary preventive actions that seek to ensure that sustainable containment of <b>residual</b> <b>wastes</b> is achieved even when end state land uses or other factors determining successful containment are subjected to change. The defining role of exposure assessment is in the linkage of environmental contamination with activities and events that cause uptake of contaminants by human or ecological receptors. In a post- 2 remedial situation, exposure assessment helps frame the benchmarks for the originally instituted remedial actions, enables the evaluation of progress on and efficacy of instituted controls, and provides an objective framework for assessing and instituting corrective actions {{in the event of a}} changed end state or circumstances that alter previously envisaged exposure pathways.

40|$|By the {{economics}} of environment, in an economy which is closed and where there is not accumulation of stocks (plant, equipment, consumer durables, or residential buildings), the amount of <b>residuals</b> (<b>wastes)</b> inserted into the natural enviroment must be approximately equal to the weight of basic materials entering the　processing and production system, and (plus) gases taken from the atmosphere. (cf. A. Kneese(2 ̆ 771)). A real economy is open system {{and there are many}} stocks, and　interchanged goods with outside. Of course residuals do not necessarily have to be discharged to the environment. In the soft economy paths, it is possible to recycle them back to the production system.
