40|$|In the U. K., home <b>contents</b> <b>insurance</b> {{is widely}} available, with a {{reduction}} in the number of “traditional” insurance companies offering cover being offset by a growth in the availability through “non-traditional” providers such as supermarkets, motoring organizations and even energy providers. Research suggests that while around 80 per cent of all households are covered by home <b>contents</b> <b>insurance,</b> only around 50 per cent of people living in rented or local authority housing insure their contents. The low uptake is undesirable for two reasons. Firstly, financial exclusion is a phenomenon whereby individuals or sectors of society are deliberately, or effectively, denied access to financial services products, including home insurance, and it is commonly government policy to reduce such exclusion. Secondly, possession of <b>contents</b> <b>insurance</b> by householders minimizes the possibility that after a catastrophic loss such as flooding, uninsured persons will seek emergency assistance and temporary housing at the expense of their local authority. Studies and government reports exist that shed light upon the reasons behind the low purchase of conventionally marketed insurance. Special schemes exist to encourage purchase of insurance by enabling home <b>contents</b> <b>insurance</b> for local authority tenants to be paid for along with rent. Governments support such schemes. There appears to be little published research to indicate the extent to which such schemes are used by tenants. We survey local authorities in Scotland to determine the availability of “insurance with rent” schemes and their take-up rate by tenants. We find that many schemes exist, providing average market cover at typically average or lower cost and that there is no evidence of highly selective underwriting and pricing. Despite this easy availability of competitively priced, good policy cover, we find that the take-up rates by tenants are low. We consider reasons why apparently effective insurance products are not more popular. We conclude that local authorities and government need to promote the schemes with greater vigour.

40|$|This paper {{includes}} {{details of}} {{changes to the}} CPI basket of representative goods and services, the new CPI expenditure weights and {{an analysis of the}} main changes in weights. Summary 	We added 15 items to the CPI basket and removed 12. 	The CPI’s scope has been extended to include purchases of pets. 	Housing and household utilities, and miscellaneous goods and services had the biggest increases in weight. The weights for recreation and culture, household contents and services, communication, education, food, and alcoholic beverages and tobacco also increased. 	Increases were influenced by higher spending on restaurant meals and ready-to-eat foods, cigarettes and tobacco (due to higher prices), rent, furniture and furnishings, and insurance. 	Health had the biggest decrease in weight. The weights for clothing and footwear, and transport also decreased. 	The decrease in the relative weight for health was influenced by a refinement to our method for calculating out-patient services – to exclude more non-household income from industry income information. 	We reviewed the methods we use to calculate weights for construction of new dwellings (part of home ownership), and dwelling and <b>contents</b> <b>insurance,</b> to ensure we account for effects from the 2010 / 11 Canterbury earthquakes appropriately. No major changes were made to construction. However, we did change the method we use for dwelling and <b>contents</b> <b>insurance...</b>|$|R

50|$|When <b>contents</b> <b>insurance</b> {{states that}} new-for-old applies, this {{increases}} the likelihood of under insurance. For example, a quantity of items amongst the contents might have a low resale value but a high new-for-old value. This can happen if quantities of used or second-hand goods are collected; their resale value may be low, but to replace as-new would require a high payout against the policy. In such a case, if the policy is subject to average, any claim will be reduced by the value of the underinsurance. Crucially, this occurs with partial loss of the contents, even where the low-resale value contents are completely undamaged and may even be stored separately, as in an undamaged outhouse covered as part of the policy.|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{possibility}} that a systematic relationship exists between employment within a particular type of contract and risk preference. We exploit a set of proxies for risk preference, whereby some of the proxies capture risk loving behaviour (expenditure on gambling, smoking and alcohol) whereas others capture risk averse behaviour (expenditure on life and <b>contents</b> <b>insurance,</b> and unearned income). The empirical analysis, based on pooled cross-section data from the UK Family Expenditure Survey, 1997 - 2000, provides evidence of a systematic relationship between employment contract type and risk preference, with, for example, self-employed workers being more or less likely to engage in the consumption of &# 039;risky&# 039; or financial security products respectively. The results are based on the ordered generalized extreme value model, a relatively infrequently used discrete choice model, which allows for ordering and correlation in the alternatives observed...|$|R
40|$|Section 35 of the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 {{requires}} insurers offering {{insurance policies}} in six prescribed areas "to clearly inform" prospective insureds of any departure their policies may constitute {{from the standard}} covers established by the Act and its accompanying Regulations. This prescribed insurance contracts regime was designed to remedy comprehension problems generated by the length and complexity of insurance documents and to alleviate misunderstanding over the terms and conditions of individual policies. This article examines the rationale underpinning s 35 and the prescribed insurance contracts regime {{and looks at the}} operation of the legislation with particular reference to home <b>contents</b> <b>insurance</b> in Australia. It is argued that the means whereby disclosure of derogation from standard cover may be effected largely negates the thrust of the prescribed insurance contract reform.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} eight {{recommendations}} of the 2014 Financial System Inquiry relating to consumer outcomes. These include strengthening product issuer and distributor accountability, providing specific product intervention power to the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC), and facilitating innovative product disclosure. They also include better aligning the interests of financial firms and consumers, raising the competency of financial advisers, and improving guidance and disclosure in general insurance. The response by Australian industry and consumer groups has been generally favourable despite the expected difficulties and lack of detail associated with the product design and distribution obligation, and concerns about the substantial product intervention powers extended to ASIC. Some unease also exists about the apparent inattention to key issues in the general insurance industry, especially underinsurance and noninsurance in home and <b>contents</b> <b>insurance</b> relating to natural disasters.

40|$|Taiwan had {{approximately}} 3, 000 buildings {{damaged by}} floods with an economic loss of NT$ 12. 8 billion annually, a figure 4. 5 {{times more than}} economic losses due to fire damages. Many insurers become extremely cautious when underwriting their flood policies for people living {{in areas that are}} frequently struck by floods. The rising damages also trigger the demand for a mandatory national flood insurance program. This paper describes the development of an integrated flood risk assessment model for Taiwan which contains of a hazard, vulnerability and financial analysis module.

40|$|The {{fire season}} has started early. Homes were {{destroyed}} {{last month in}} bushfires near Lancefield, Victoria, while buildings and lives have been lost as fires continue to sweep through southern Western Australia. Alongside the devastating loss of life and properties, many properties potentially {{in the path of}} Australian bushfires are inadequately insured. While we have known about high rates of non-insurance and under-insurance across Australia for some time, there is surprisingly little solid data on the issue. We recently set out to address this gap at both the national and regional level. Early findings from a national survey (which we will be presenting at the 2015 TASA conference later this month) indicate 13 % of those surveyed are without insurance cover for their assets - 9 % of home owners are without house insurance and 41 % of tenants do not have <b>contents</b> <b>insurance.</b> Approximately one-quarter of those who are insured may also be inadequately covered...|$|R
