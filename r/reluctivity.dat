In the end, the shape of rotor poles were optimized also {{with respect to the}} level of noise and vibrations. This did result in significant reductions of both the rms of the CT (82 %) and the mean value of the standard deviation (43 %). Thereby we were able to take variations with respect to manufacturing tolerances/imperfections into account by assuming a random field for the <b>reluctivities.</b> As a drawback, we reported a small decrease in the root mean square values of the electromagnetic torque and back EMF. However, it should be noticed that aims of the low cogging torque robust topology optimization (the electric machine in the no-load mode) have been completely fulfilled. Additionally, the waveform has been considerably improved about 32 %, while the torque ripple has been reduced around 52 %. The detailed analysis presented in Table  2 indicates that further research should be focused on the low ripple torque robust design in the on-load state (with excitation currents included). Then, the robust optimization of the electric machine could be performed when taking both the ripple torque and the average electromagnetic torque into account. This is considered as a further direction of our investigation. This work also highlights the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.|$|R
