50|$|Any {{discussion}} of Zaitsevs rule would be incomplete without mentioning <b>Vladimir</b> <b>Vasilyevich</b> Markovnikov. Zaitsev and Markovnikov both studied under Alexander Butlerov, {{taught at the}} University of Kazan during the same period, and were bitter rivals. Markovnikov, who published in 1870 what {{is now known as}} Markovnikovs rule, and Zaitsev held conflicting views regarding elimination reactions: the former believed that the least substituted alkene would be favored, whereas the latter felt the most substituted alkene would be the major product. Perhaps {{one of the main reasons}} Zaitsev began investigating elimination reactions was to disprove his rival. Zaitsev published his rule for elimination reactions just after Markovnikov published the first article in a three-part series in Comptes Rendus detailing his rule for addition reactions.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} teach, he {{required}} either a master's degree from a Russian university, or a Ph.D. {{from a foreign}} university, so he wrote up {{his work on the}} sulfoxides and submitted it to the University of Leipzig where (probably thanks to Kolbe's influence) he was awarded the Ph.D. in 1866. With Zaitsev now holding the Ph.D., Butlerov was able to secure his appointment as an assistant in agronomy. (In March 1866 the Kazan University board voted for this appointment.) Two years later, Zaitsev was awarded his M. Chem. degree, and, the following year (1869) was appointed as Extraordinary Professor of Chemistry, the junior colleague of another Butlerov student, <b>Vladimir</b> <b>Vasilyevich</b> Markovnikov (1838-1904). Zaitsev submitted his Dr. Chem. dissertation in 1870, and was awarded the degree over the indirect objections of Markovnikov (as second examiner of the dissertation, Markovnikov had written an overtly positive assessment that was meant to be read between the lines). The same year, he was promoted to Ordinary Professor of Chemistry. This may {{have been one of the}} final straws for Markovnikov, who left Kazan' university in 1871 for Odessa. Zaitsev continued at Kazan' university until his death in 1910.|$|R
