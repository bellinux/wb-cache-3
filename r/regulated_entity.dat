50|$|Regulation by the Banking Department {{begins with}} chartering, {{in the case}} of banks, trust {{companies}} and thrifts, licensing {{in the case of}} most other entities, and registration in the case of mortgage brokers. For all entities, it involves an evaluation of the character and fitness of incorporators (for chartered entities), directors and officers. For banking entities, it also involves requirements as to corporate governance and limitations on corporate powers. For most entities, it also involves financial requirements, such as a requirement as to minimum net capital. Banking organizations are also subject to restrictions on payment of dividends as well as restrictions on transactions with affiliates and loans to any one borrower. For all entities, it involves the requirement to maintain accurate books and records of its financial condition and transactions, as well as regular examination by the Department’s examination staff, which ranges from continuous on-site examination for the largest entities, to discrete examinations at appropriate intervals. Under the Banking Law, the Superintendent may require a <b>regulated</b> <b>entity</b> to appear and explain any apparent violation of law, issue an order directing a <b>regulated</b> <b>entity</b> to discontinue unauthorized or unsafe practices or to make good an impairment of capital or, {{in the case of a}} banking organization, required reserves, or to improve its recordkeeping. The Superintendent may take possession of and liquidate a banking organization and may suspend or revoke a certificate or license to do business or certain activities of a regulated non-banking entity. It holds in trust any unclaimed assets of a liquidated bank. Finally, under Section 44 of the Banking Law, following notice and a hearing, the Superintendent may impose penalties to be paid to the State.|$|E

40|$|This paper evaluates {{a recent}} {{innovation}} in regulating risk called management-based regulation. Traditionally, risk regulation has either specified a particular means of achieving a risk-reduction goal or specified the goal {{and left the}} means of achieving that goal up to the <b>regulated</b> <b>entity.</b> In contrast, management-based regulation neither explicitly imposes the means, nor the ends. Rather, what is required is that each <b>regulated</b> <b>entity</b> review its production processes and develop a set of goals and procedures that will reduce risk. I {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} management-based regulation by taking advantage of policy variation that occurred when 14 states adopted such regulations for toxic chemical control in the 1990 s. Using panel data for just over 31, 000 manufacturing plants in the United States, I investigate whether facilities subject to management-based regulations had larger changes in total quantities of toxic chemical releases, engaged in more pollution prevention activities, or reported fewer toxic chemicals to the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI). The results indicate that management-based regulation has had a measurable positive effect on the environmental performance of manufacturing plants. In particular, plants subject to management-based regulation experienced larger decreases in total pounds of toxic chemicals released and were {{more likely to engage in}} source reduction activities. © 2007 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management...|$|E

40|$|Real options {{achieve their}} value from {{flexible}} management response to signals about uncertainty. Any constraint on flexibility will obviously impair the real option value. Regulation imposes constraints on operations, but also provides tariffs to the <b>regulated</b> <b>entity.</b> Thus, {{it is not}} obvious that the <b>regulated</b> <b>entity</b> necessarily suffers a value loss from regulation, if the tariffs are excessively generous. The {{question of whether the}} tariffs are excessively generous is a question of social optimality. We address this question in the context of facilities access, which is a popular method of “deregulating ” industries that had monopoly power. The regulator determines tariffs for access to the production facilities of the oligopolist facility owner so that competitors can use the facilities and offer the consumption good in a competitive market. This is the basis for deregulation of power, gas distribution and telecom industries. It has also been proposed in industries that were not formerly regulated, such as the rail infrastructure for integrated mining industries. Pindyck has suggested that access tariffs in these cases should include compensation for the capital costs plus the real option premium that was extinguished to establish the facility. But he offers no proof, nor any analysis of the magnitude and direction of the distortion if compensation is only offered for the capital costs only. Also, he does not consider two-part tariff structure with an up-front access tariff, plus an annual tariff for capacity. In this paper, we investigate these issues numerically. ...|$|E
