30|$|Both strenuous {{strength}} exercise (e.g., resistance exercise, rebound jump) and prolonged endurance exercise (e.g., marathon running) involving eccentric contraction result in exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) (Nosaka et al. 1991; Child et al. 1998; Nosaka and Sakamoto 2000). The majority {{of previous studies}} evaluated time courses changes in various symptoms of EIMD, including muscular strength loss (Clarkson and Sayers 1999), <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> of motion (Chen et al. 2009), swelling of muscle (Hirose et al. 2004), decrease in running economy (Satkunskienė et al. 2015) and intracellular enzyme or proteins in blood circulation (Peake et al. 2005). Among them, elevated concentrations of creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin (Mb), and inflammatory cytokines {{are known to be}} prevalent parameters as indirect markers of EIMD (Nehlsen-Cannarella et al. 1997; Nieman et al. 2003; Kłapcińska et al. 2013; Del Coso et al. 2013). Prolonged running causes marked elevation of plasma interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) concentration (Nieman et al. 2014). The elevated IL- 6 concentration mainly reflects locally produced cytokine from working muscles (Ostrowski et al. 1998). Del Coso et al. (2013) reported that declining of running speed during a full marathon was positively correlated with elevation of serum Mb concentration. In addition, the games of team sports such as soccer and basketball which involve highly metabolic demands evoke EIMD (Souglis et al. 2015; Chatzinikolaou et al. 2014). In particular, soccer matches have been shown to produce profound muscle damage compared with the other type of team sports (Souglis et al. 2015). During soccer matches, the players are required to cover large distances under high velocity, and average heart rate (HR) during the game was reported to be equivalent to about 86.9  ±  4.3  % for maximal HR (Souglis et al. 2015). In addition, various activities such as jump, agility and change of direction are frequently observed over 90  min of game. Furthermore, CK concentration was increased twice, and IL- 6 concentration was elevated by four–five-fold following soccer game (Souglis et al. 2015). Inflammatory cytokine release such as IL- 6 during intensive exercise is suggested to be a factor for reduction of exercise performance (Welc and Clanton 2013). Collectively, attenuation of muscle damage and inflammatory response during team sports is considered to be important to delay the onset of fatigue and to maintain exercise capacity throughout the game.|$|E

40|$|Clinical studies {{reported}} frequent failure with anterior instrumented multilevel cervical corpectomies. Hence, posterior augmentation was recommended but necessitates a second approach. Thus, an author group evaluated the feasibility, pull-out characteristics, {{and accuracy of}} anterior transpedicular screw (ATPS) fixation. Although first success with clinical application of ATPS has already been reported, no data exist on biomechanical characteristics of an ATPS-plate system enabling transpedicular end-level fixation in advanced instabilities. Therefore, we evaluated biomechanical qualities of an ATPS prototype C 4 –C 7 for <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>range</b> of motion (ROM) and primary stability in a non-destructive setup among five constructs: anterior plate, posterior all-lateral mass screw construct, posterior construct with lateral mass screws C 5  + C 6 and end-level fixation using pedicle screws unilaterally or bilaterally, and a 360 ° construct. 12 human spines C 3 –T 1 {{were divided into two}} groups. Four constructs were tested in group 1 and three in group 2; the ATPS prototypes were tested in both groups. Specimens were subjected to flexibility test in a spine motion tester at intact state and after 2 -level corpectomy C 5 –C 6 with subsequent reconstruction using a distractable cage and one of the osteosynthesis mentioned above. ROM in flexion–extension, axial rotation, and lateral bending was reported as normalized values. All instrumentations but the anterior plate showed significant reduction of ROM for all directions compared to the intact state. The 360 ° construct outperformed all others in terms of reducing ROM. While {{there were no significant differences}} between the 360 ° and posterior constructs in flexion–extension and lateral bending, the 360 ° constructs were significantly more stable in axial rotation. Concerning primary stability of ATPS prototypes, there were no significant differences compared to posterior-only constructs in flexion–extension and axial rotation. The 360 ° construct showed significant differences to the ATPS prototypes in flexion–extension, while no significant differences existed in axial rotation. But in lateral bending, the ATPS prototype and the anterior plate performed significantly worse than the posterior constructs. ATPS was shown to confer increased primary stability compared to the anterior plate in flexion–extension and axial rotation with the latter yielding significance. We showed that primary stability after 2 -level corpectomy reconstruction using ATPS prototypes compared favorably to posterior systems and superior to anterior plates. From the biomechanical point, the 360 ° instrumentation was shown the most efficient for reconstruction of 2 -level corpectomies. Further studies will elucidate whether fatigue testing will enhance the benefit of transpedicular anchorage with posterior constructs and ATPS...|$|E
