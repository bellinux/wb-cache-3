40|$|Abstract. Filter paper splash {{procedure}} {{is a kind}} of measuring means to raindrop size. It is used widely and operated briefly and its cost is low. The article mainly introduces the influence of different heights to the <b>stain</b> <b>diameter</b> and the relationship between <b>stain</b> <b>diameter</b> and the raindrop’s. According to the experiment, the relation between the <b>stain</b> <b>diameter</b> and the raindrop’s is d= 0. 478 D 0. 610. it is the research foundation of filter paper stain method. According to the data from Fangxian area using the method of filter paper splash procedure, we can conclude that the raindrop kinetic energy has a positive relationship with rainfall intensity. The research is useful for measuring the water and soil loss. Water and soil loss is one of the global environment problems. The most important factor which can cause water and soil loss is rainfall. The research on raindrop kinetic energy is important for the further analysis of water and soil loss. A classical approach for the research on raindrop kinetic energy is paper splash procedure. The relationship between <b>stain</b> <b>diameter</b> and raindrop diameter shall be calibrated in this approach. In general, influences from titrated water drop height and <b>stain</b> <b>diameter</b> are not considered in the calibration process. In this experiment, influences of rain drop height on <b>stain</b> <b>diameter</b> are researched in the stain calibration...|$|R

The present study deals with the immune response and effecter mechanism, which was confirmed by migration inhibition factor (MIF). Methods: The present work was conducted in Parasitological Lab of Postgraduate Department of Zoology, Government Holkar Science College, Indore (M. P.) during 2006 - 2007. For MIF assay, lymphocytes were separated from heparinized blood of experimental and control mice. Aliquots of cell suspension were placed in four wells cut in a preparation of agarose in a Petri dish. Two wells were filled with soluble test antigen, while rest two wells were filled with medium (control wells). Petri dish was incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified environment at 5 % CO 2 in air. Cells migrated under the agarose in a circle were fixed and <b>stained.</b> <b>Diameters</b> of the migration areas were measured with ocular micrometer. Result: MIF reaction was maximum (44. 2 %) in the group IVEgESAg 5 and minimum (10. 8 %) in the group IVASoAg 1. The maximum MIF reaction was shown by eggs ES antigen and least by adult worm somatic antigen. The interesting observation was that migration inhibition increases as dose increased or we could say the reaction was dose dependent Conclusion: Increased value of MIF response in vaccinated mice suggested the involvement of lymphocytes in cell-mediated immunity. This study also proves that excretory-secretory (ES) antigen of eggs from Trichuris muris was more effective in imparting immunity in mice...|$|R

Thus iron hematoxylin becomes adequate for routine use. Hematoxylin is a natural dye extracted from Haematoxylon campechianum, of the family Leguminosae. It must first be ‘ripened’, i. e. oxidized to hematein, which reacts with ferric ammonium sulphate to produce the ferric lake (iron hematoxylin), a basic dye.

These filaments may extend over several micrometers. At low ionic strength and neutral pH, the critical concentration for pepstatin A filament assembly is 0. 1 mM. At higher pepstatin A concentrations or in physiological salt solutions, a variety of higher order structures were observed, including ribbons, sheets, and cylinders with both regular and twisted or irregular geometries. Pepstatin A polymerized into these higher order structures loses its ability to inhibit the aspartyl protease of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1.

SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION Methylene Blue is recognized as a simple stain {{that can be used for}} a variety of purposes, such as determining bacterial morphology and aiding in the interpretation of the Quellung test. 1 It is the stain of choice for the presumptive identification of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Upon staining, this species is characterized by a beaded or banded appearance of the cell, with deeply stained metachromatic granules contrasted with a lighter blue cytoplasm. 2, 3 Methylene Blue is used as an adjunct to the Gram stain, especially in the staining of gramnegative bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria species. 4, 5 The stain can reveal the morphology of fusiform bacteria and spirochetes (from oral infections such as Vincent’s angina) that may be difficult to see with the Gram stain. 5 The stain is also used to detect the presence of fecal white blood cells that may show the presence of invasive bowel disease. 5 BBL Methylene Blue Loeffler Stain Droppers can be used as a counterstain with BBL Flagella Stain Droppers, which are <b>recommended</b> for <b>staining</b> the flagella of bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Cryptosporidium is a coccidian {{protozoan}} parasite {{which causes}} considerable {{morbidity and mortality}} in young animals and in the immunocompromised host. Diagnosis of Cryptosporidiosis is generally done by means of detection of oocysts in faeces using different faecal concentration techniques and staining techniques. This study was carried out to compare staining techniques: MZN and Giemsa; faecal concentration techniques: MSSF and MSF, to identify the most sensitive faecal concentration and the staining technique to diagnose Cryptosporidial infection in buffalo. Out of twenty faecal samples tested, number of Cryptosporidium oocyst positivity and oocyst recovery rate were high in MZN method compared to Giemsa staining technique. Out of 65 buffalo faecal samples, cryptosporidial oocyst positivity for MSSF and MSF faecal concentration methods were 60 % and 50. 8 % respectively. However, the Cryptosporidium o ocyst recovery was high with the MSSF method compared to MSF method. This study concluded that MSSF and MSF faecal concentration methods are equally efficient in diagnosing severe cryptosporidial infection with high oocyst counts. Preferably, the diagnosis of mild cryptosporidial infection with low cryptoporidial oocyst counts can be efficiently detected by the MSSF method.

A total of 3, 997 stool samples from 1, 570 patients were examined by both methods. Of the 3, 997 samples, 31 % (1, 239 of 3, 997) contained helminths or protozoans or both. A total of 11 % (434 of 3, 997) of the samples representing 14 % (221 of 1, 570) of the patients were positive for one or more helminth species. A total of 570 separate identifications of helminth ova/larvae were made. Among the helminth ova/larvae identified. 14. 6 % (83 of 570) were detected only in the trichrome-stained smear, representing 6. 3 % (14 of 221) of the patients.

Methods A total of 65 patients who had died of PBSI and other conditions were randomly selected. They were divided into 2 groups, an injury group (25 cases) and a control group (20 cases). Slides of each patient’s midbrain, pons, and medulla oblongata were prepared and stained with HE, argentaffin, and immunohistochemical agents (GFAP, NF, amyloid-ß, MBP). Under low power (× 100) and NF <b>staining,</b> the <b>diameter</b> of the thickest longitudinal axon was measured at its widest point.

40|$|Although thermal {{relaxation}} {{times of}} cutaneous port-wine stain microvessels have been calculated {{and used to}} formulate laser selective photothermolysis, {{they have never been}} measured. A scheme to do so was devised by measuring the skin response to pairs of 585 -nm dye laser pulses (250 – 360 microseconds each) {{as a function of the}} time interval between the two pulses, in five volunteers with port-wine stains. After a pump pulse delivering 80 % of the fluence necessary for causing purpura, the fluence of a second probe pulse necessary to cause purpura was determined and was found to increase with the interval between the two pulses, in a manner consistent with thermal diffusion theory. Biopsy specimens were obtained from four of the five subjects to examine the nature and extent of vessel damage and to measure the port-wine <b>stain</b> vessel <b>diameters.</b> Using diffusion theory, the thermal relaxation time was calculated based on the measured vessel diameters. These calculated values are consistent with the increase in radiant exposure (fluence) of the probe pulse necessary to induce purpura for longer time delays. Two simple models for thermal relaxation of port-wine stain vessels are presented and compared with the data. The data and histologic assessment of the vessel injury strongly suggest that pulse durations for ideal laser treatment are in the 1 - 10 -millisecond region and depend on vessel diameter.

Electrospinning is a technique that facilitates the production of nanofibers and is commonly used to develop fibrous scaffolds to be used in tissue engineering. In the present study, a different approach for cell incorporation into fibrous scaffolds was tested. Mesenchymal stem cells were extracted from the wall of the umbilical cord and mononuclear cells from umbilical cord blood. Cells were re-suspended in a 10 % polyvinyl alcohol solution and subjected to electrospinning for 30 min under a voltage of 21 kV. Cell viability was assessed before and after the procedure by exclusion of dead cells using trypan blue <b>staining.</b> Fiber <b>diameter</b> was observed by scanning electron microscopy and the presence of cells within the scaffolds was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. After electrospinning, the viability of mesenchymal stem cells was reduced from 88 to 19. 6 % and the viability of mononuclear cells from 99 to 8. 38 %. The loss of viability was possibly due to the high viscosity of the polymer solution, which reduced the access to nutrients associated with electric and mechanical stress during electrospinning. These results suggest that the incorporation of cells during fiber formation by electrospinning is a viable process that needs more investigation in order to find ways to protect cells from damage...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The adenoma-carcinoma {{sequence}} in hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is accelerated. It remains unknown whether the mismatch repair (MMR) defect also promotes {{the development of}} adenomas. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the risk of developing colorectal adenoma and carcinoma in HNPCC carriers and noncarriers (controls) and to compare the features of adenomas in both groups. METHODS: Eighty-six families with a known MMR gene mutation from the Dutch HNPCC Registry were analyzed. Subjects with known mutation status with colonoscopies performed for the purpose of surveillance were selected for this study. Information on the surveillance examinations was obtained from medical reports. The histology of all adenomas was confirmed. Immunohistochemistry was performed in a subgroup of adenomas. RESULTS: We identified 249 carriers and 247 controls. The proportion of subjects free of an adenoma at the age of 60 years was 29. 7 % for carriers and 70. 8 % for controls (P < 0. 05). The adenomas in carriers were larger, and a higher proportion had villous components and/or high-grade dysplasia (P < 0. 05, all analyses). The adenomas and carcinomas of the carriers were located predominantly in the proximal colon. Most adenomas showed absent staining of the MMR proteins. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the MMR defect is involved in the early stages of development of adenomas.

Specific antibody to rabbit muscle actin, produced in guinea pigs, was used in indirect immunofluorescence of the M. pneumoniae colonies. Fluorescence was detected, with concentrations at the colony center and at the tips of filamentous cells...|$|R
40|$|METHODS: The {{cutaneous}} capillary {{lymphatic system}} {{in patients with}} systemic sclerosis was investigated using fluorescence microlymphography. The distal upper limbs of 16 healthy controls (mean age 62. 3 +/- 13. 1 yr) and 16 patients with systemic sclerosis (mean age 58. 9 +/- 13. 6 yr) were examined and the following parameters were evaluated: (a) single lymphatic capillaries; (b) lymphatic capillary network and cutaneous backflow; (c) extension of the <b>stained</b> lymphatics; (d) <b>diameter</b> of single lymphatic capillaries. RESULTS: At the finger level, lymphatic capillaries were lacking in five patients, while they were present in all controls (P < 0. 05). Extension of the stained lymphatics was increased in 11 patients (8. 1 +/- 6. 0 mm) compared to the 16 healthy controls (2. 0 +/- 1. 2 mm) (P < 0. 0001). Cutaneous backflow was observed in three patients (P < 0. 05). At the hand level, lymphatic network extension was significantly different between patients (3. 8 +/- 2. 4 mm) and controls (1. 2 +/- 0. 8 mm) (P < 0. 01); however, {{no significant differences were}} found at the forearm level.

30|$|Regarding minimal {{invasive}} tooth preparation, the endpoint of {{caries excavation}} can clinically be defined {{based on the}} hardness of dentin as felt with a dental probe, and also more subjective features such as the colour and moisture of the excavated dentin (de Almeida Neves et al. 2011; Neves Ade et al. 2011). In an attempt to develop an objective caries-removal procedure, the clinical use of staining agents were included (Fusayama 1993). The clinical and laboratory studies, however, revealed that hard and sound pulpal floors stain more easily because of its lower degree of mineralization {{and it has been}} <b>recommended</b> that light-pink <b>stained</b> tissue should be left in the cavity (Kidd et al. 1989; Yip et al. 1994). In this study, caries removal endpoint was reached when a ‘hard’ cavity floor was felt using dental explorer with a gentle pressure and the caries detector dye was used to guide and limit excavation to caries-infected dentin following excavation in all groups. However, residual dentin stained light-pink with a caries-staining dye retained in the cavity as instructed (de Almeida Neves et al. 2011; Neves Ade et al. 2011).|$|R
40|$|Classification of {{peripheral}} T-cell lymphomas {{based on}} morphological criteria can present problems due to overlap in histological features amongst the subtypes. An immunohistochemical {{study was designed}} to study the follicular dendritic cell patterns in 21 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma which had been classified using the updated Kiel classification. Three patterns of distribution were observed: 1 follicular dendritic cells not detected (3 cases); 2 follicular dendritic cells restricted to remnant follicle centres (7); 3 follicular dendritic cells present as an expanded network of cells exceeding the confines of germinal centres (11). Ten out of 11 angioimmunoblastic lymphomas showed an expanded network of follicular dendritic cells. The only negative case showed features which, on review, were in keeping with a pleomorphic, medium and large cell lymphoma showing an unusual proliferation of small venules. Other than angioimmunoblastic lymphomas, only one other case showed follicular dendritic cell hyperplasia. This was an unclassified peripheral T-cell lymphoma. We conclude that follicular dendritic cell hyperplasia may be used as an aid to diagnosis of the angioimmunoblastic type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, and we <b>recommend</b> the routine <b>staining</b> of these cells in typing of T-cell lymphomas to facilitate comparison between centres. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundThe {{diagnosis}} of periprosthetic knee infections can present {{a challenge to}} surgeons, {{especially in the case}} of chronic presentation. Gram stains are regularly performed as part of the microbiological evaluation of suspected infected total knee arthroplasties. Recently, the utility of this test in diagnosing infections has been questioned. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of Gram stains performed from surgical site samples by comparing their results to the final {{diagnosis of}} infection. MethodsThe results of 347 Gram stains performed at a single center at the time of revision total knee arthroplasty for both septic and aseptic reasons were compared to the final diagnosis based on intra-operative findings and histological evaluation. ResultsGram staining demonstrated a low sensitivity of 7 % (95 % confidence interval 4 – 12 %), a specificity of 99 % (95 % confidence interval 97 – 100 %), and positive and negative predictive values of 92 % and 57 %, respectively. ConclusionsThis study confirmed previous findings of the poor utility of this test for the diagnosis of periprosthetic knee infections. The authors <b>recommend</b> that Gram <b>staining</b> no longer be performed at the time of suspected periprosthetic knee arthroplasty infection...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Background & aim: Statins are inhibitors drugs of {{hydroxymethyl}} glotaryl coenzyme A. In {{addition to}} decreasing plasma cholesterol, low-density cholesterol they reduce {{the rate of}} triglycerides. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of atorvastatin on rat pancreatic tissue. In addition to decreasing the rate of plasma cholesterol concentration they also decrease the rate of LDL and Triglyceride. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of atorvastatin on rat pancreatic tissue. Methods: In this study, 32 adult male rats were divided into four groups, control and three test groups. To conduct the present study, 32 male adult rats were divided into 4 equal groups: one control group and three test groups. Then the test groups were treated by Atorvastatin for 45 days with 10 mg (group 1), 20 mg (group 2) and 30 mg (group 3) doses respectively. At the end of the treatment period, all rats were killed by taking blood from their hearts. The pancreas tissue of each rat (N= 32) was separated. After fixation, tissue preparation and slide <b>staining,</b> Longerhans <b>diameter</b> was measured and number of cells was counted. Data were analyzed by t test. After fixing and coloring the tissue, all slides were prepared and evaluated under the microscope the diameter of I's of Longerhans and the number of cells. The data was analyzed through t-test. Results: There was no significant difference in the diameter mean of Longerhans between the test groups and the control group. The mean number of islets cells were increased in compared to the control group (P> 0. 05). There was also a significant increase was shown in the number of Longerhans cells in the test groups in relation to the control group (p (05 / 0 >. (p> 0. 05). Conclusion: The consumption of the atorvastatine causes an increase in the number of Longerhans cells. In addition, the increase in the number of cells also increases the insulin secretion. As a result, blood sugar is decreased. Key Words: Atorvastatin, Pancreas, Ra...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the nature and}} origin of "blue blobs" (Bbs) in atrophic Pap smears in postmenopausal women and to study their clinical significance. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study of 412 atrophic Pap smears from postmenopausal women was done to detect the presence of Bbs. The smears from 24 cases showing Bbs were further studied to evaluate {{the nature of the}} Bbs with special stains, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Bbs showed a heterogeneous morphology, with variable numbers and <b>staining</b> intensity. The <b>diameter</b> of Bbs was approximately equivalent to that of a parabasal/intermediate squamous cell. Special stains showed Bbs to be positive for periodic acid-Schiff and methyl green pyronin and negative for mucicarmine and calcium. Immunohistochemistry revealed Bbs to be positive for cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen and carcinoembryonic antigen and negative for vimentin and muscle-specific actin. Some Bbs had residual ghost nuclear shadows. Electron microscopy revealed cellular skeletons with residual tonofilaments enmeshed within a loose cytoskeleton matrix and nuclei with variable degrees of degeneration. CONCLUSION: Special stains, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy indicated that Bbs represent parabasal/intermediate squamous cells exhibiting various degree of degeneration. In general, Bbs appear to be of no clinical significance except as a source of potential diagnostic error...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHaematological {{methods are}} widely {{utilised}} among avian ecologists {{as a means}} for individual health assessment. However, the technical simplicity of some of the tests may easily lead to oversimplification of the evaluation. Here, we show in the Scarlet Rosefinch () that haematological parameters other than the widely used heterophil/lymphocyte (H/L) ratio may be important to investigate. We give the full description of seven basic haematological traits (leukocyte differential count, immature erythrocyte count, haematocrit, mean cell volume, total red and white blood cell count and blood parasite occurrence). Most remarkably, the examination of 178 adults and 155 nestlings has revealed that this species has an extraordinarily high proportion of basophils among the peripheral blood leukocytes (on average about 42 and 56 %, respectively). Although the high basophil count is a general trait even in healthy individuals of this species, the proportion of these cells is condition-dependent and is further increased by infection. Our results also suggest that the immature erythrocyte count in the peripheral blood is a good predictor of the nestlings' growth rate. We conclude that the Rosefinch haematology differs strikingly from other avian species with known values of basic haematological parameters. We therefore emphasise the importance of a general haematological examination, based on material obtained by an appropriate method (e. g. for smear preparation, we <b>recommend</b> using differential <b>staining</b> and avoiding prior methanol fixation) ...|$|R
