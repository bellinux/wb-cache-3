40|$|Introduction: Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) is {{a common}} {{neurological}} disorder that impairs nocturnal rest, causing decreased alertness, depressed mood, <b>reduced</b> <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> and poor quality of life. In patients affected by severe RLS, pharmacological treatment is mandatory. Areas covered: The present review {{is based on an}} extensive Internet and PubMed search from 1994 - 2014. It focuses on drugs currently in development for the treatment of RLS. Expert opinion: The drugs currently available for treating RLS do not always allow the patient to obtain a dose capable of controlling the symptoms, particularly in the long term. There is still the need for effective and well-tolerated new drugs. Monoamine oxidase B inhibitors could be good candidates for the initial treatment of RLS, sparing stronger dopaminergic agents for later stages of the disease. Oxycodone-naloxone has demonstrated a significant and sustained effect on patients with severe RLS inadequately controlled with first-line drugs; it {{could be used as a}} long-term treatment option in severe cases of RLS for which alternative satisfactory drug regimens are unavailable. There is a paucity of data comparing medications in head-to-head trials to determine their relative effectiveness and adverse event profiles.

40|$|Firefighters and EMS {{responders}} are {{at increased}} risk for on-the-job injuries, and firefighters have the highest on the job heart attack rate of any occupation. It may not be a coincidence that these same medical problems also are associ-ated with chronic sleep deprivation. Lack of sleep can cause mental fatigue and reduce work performance; it can also lead to an increase in cardiovascular disease and fatigue-related accidents and injuries. How much of these health risks are due to the chaotic sleep patterns associated with firefighting and EMS work? Over the past year, the IAFC and USFA, with help from Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU), have been working on a project to answer that question and to develop a training module designed to assist firefighters and EMS re-sponders in combating unpredictable sleeping patterns and the effects of sleep deprivation. As a nation, we are sleeping less and working longer hours than any other country. Firefighters and EMS responders are no exception, and their shift schedules may present unique challenges. Firefighting {{is one of the few}} professions with 24 -hour workdays, and within that general structure more than 20 different three- or four-platoon schedules exist, reflecting local preferences, needs and tradition. Superimpose variability in call number and workload among fire stations and EMS units, and it becomes difficult to generalize conclusions about the impact of different sched-ules and chronic sleep deprivation. However, a few facts are clear. Most people need an average of six to eight hours of sleep a night. Insufficient sleep <b>reduces</b> <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> and over time impairs mental and physical health. Studies demonstrate that fighter pilots, physicians, ship captains, rocket scientists, firefighters and EMS respond-ers are all adversely affected by chronic sleep deprivation. Catastrophic events, such as the Exxon Valdez and Challenger disasters, as well as more than 100, 000 traffic crashes each year, are related to sleep deprivation. In fact...|$|R

In fact, {{as a universal}} phenomenon that exists in all types of organizations (e.g., Ferris et al., 2008), workplace ostracism has received burgeoning scholarly attention for the past decade. As a kind of negative interpersonal experience, it can bring emotional exhaustion and depression, weaken self-regulatory resources (Ferris et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2012), <b>reduce</b> <b>job</b> satisfaction, <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> and organizational citizenship behaviors, and raise deviant behaviors and turnover intention (Ferris et al., 2008; Ferris et al., 2015).

Engaging in workplace ostracism behavior could possibly restore or maintain positive self-evaluation and balance mental states for followers in lower-quality LMX relationships (Khan et al., 2014). For example, ostracizing the “in-group” team members {{can be seen as a}} form of punishment from “out-group” members. At the same time, excluding the “in-group” members can reduce contact among followers with differentiated LMX relationships. In this way, followers with lower-quality LMX relationships are able to avoid the negative experiences coming from upward social comparison. Therefore, we propose: [...]...|$|R

Veterinarians {{play a vital role}} in New Zealand and whilst there has been considerable research on workplace stress within the profession, little is known about the extent to which workplace bullying occurs and the problems it gives rise to. This study examined job demands (team conflict and destructive leadership) and job resources (ethical leadership and perceived organisational support) and their relationship to employees’ physical health, level of strain and organisational variables in the context of workplace bullying. In addition, the buffering role of psychological capital against workplace bullying was examined. This study investigated these relationships by means of an online survey, using multiple regression analyses to test the main hypotheses. Workplace bullying was prevalent amongst this sample of New Zealand veterinarians and was associated with worse physical health, higher levels of strain, <b>reduced</b> self-rated <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> and higher intentions to quit. Destructive leadership and team conflict had direct effects on personal and organisational variables and created an environment where workplace bullying was able to flourish. Workplace bullying did not mediate relationships to the extent expected. Positive resources reduced the effects of workplace bullying on strain and selfreported <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> but not on physical health symptoms, intentions to quit and absenteeism. Overall, the results indicate negative work conditions are stronger than positive work conditions and are associated with undesirable individual and organisational variables. Workplace bullying is a potent stressor and is fostered by negative work environments.

40|$|Introduction: Restless legs {{syndrome}} (RLS) is {{a commonly}} occurring sensory motor disorder that might impair nocturnal rest causing decreased alertness, depression, <b>reduced</b> <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> and poor quality of life. In patients affected by severe RLS, a pharmacological treatment is mandatory. Areas covered: The present review {{is based on}} a search using PubMed from 1994 to 2014. It is focused on the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination and Toxicology (ADMET) characteristics of drugs currently used and under development for the treatment of RLS. Expert opinion: The drugs currently available for RLS treatment do not always provide an optimal control of symptoms. There is still need for effective and well-tolerated new drugs. Long-acting dopamine agonists showed better efficacy than short-acting compounds in the treatment of severe RLS. There seems to be an inverse relationship between the half-life of the compound and the development of augmentation.

40|$|Avaible online: [URL] audienceThe {{article focuses}} on Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which affects a {{substantial}} proportion {{of the adult population}} and it often remains undiagnosed. Because of its symptoms, which include inability to focus and maintain attention, problems in time management and procrastination, ADHD is suspected as a cause of poor performance in the workplace. A recent contemplation suggests a mechanism for that: employees with ADHD may perform less well because they are unable to focus their attention at tasks that have a long-term consequence for job accomplishment, but they instead pay attention at tasks that require immediate attention, such as responding to a low priority e-mail, but are of less long-term importance for the job. In essence, this means that employees with ADHD may still demonstrate strong effort, but they are unable to translate that effort into actual work performance because they focus on low value-adding tasks. A series of studies have provided substantial support for that reasoning. The studies not only confirmed that ADHD is associated with <b>reduced</b> <b>job</b> <b>performance,</b> but they also demonstrated that ADHD does not allow employee effort to translate into performance on the job. What the findings also implied is that those with ADHD are probably unaware that their effort does not translate into performance, so they keep working inefficiently, albeit hard. The findings make important implications for practice and how to deal with ADHD in the workplace, given that ADHD may be affecting one in ten workers...|$|E

Aims: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationships between the MS Indicator Tool and employee health, job attitudes, work performance and environmental outcomes. Methods: The first phase involved a survey employing the MS Indicator Tool, GHQ- 12, job attitudes, work performance and environmental measures. Three hundred and four call centre employees from a large utility company responded. The second phase comprised six focus groups to investigate what employees believed contributed to their perceived stress.

Such violence results in minor or major injury to these workers. In other cases, it leads to physical disability, <b>reduced</b> <b>job</b> <b>performance,</b> and eventually a nonconducive working environment for these workers. Materials and methods: A cross-sectional exploratory questionnaire was used to collect data used for {{the examination of the}} incidents of violence in the workplace. This study was carried out at the ED of the Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) Hospital. Participants for the study were drawn from nurses, support staff, and emergency physicians. Both male and female workers were surveyed. Results: The study included responses from 100 staff in the ED of the BDF Hospital in Bahrain (doctors, nurses, and support personnel). The most experienced type of violence in the workers in the past 12 months in this study was verbal abuse, which was experienced by 78 % of the participants, which was followed by physical abuse (11 %) and then sexual abuse (3 %). Many cases of violence against ED workers occurred during night shifts (53 %), while physical abuse was reported to occur during all the shifts; 40 % of the staff in the ED of the hospital were not aware of the policies against workplace violence, and 26 % of the staff considered leaving their jobs at the hospital.

40|$|Organizational {{citizenship}} behaviour (OCB) {{refers to}} a general set of behaviours exhibited by employees that are helpful, discretionary, and go beyond normal job requirements. OCB also improve organizational efficiency and effectiveness by contributing to resource transformations, innovativeness, and adaptability. This research investigates the relationship between OCB and <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> among staff nurses in government hospitals in Kedah. Further, the study will also examine the mediating effect of work environment on the OCB-job performance relationship. A number of 580 staff nurses from a total of 1759 staff nurses, {{and a total of}} 70 superiors (sisters) of nine government hospitals involved in this study. Measures of OCB and <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> were obtained from two ratings, which are, superior-ratings and self-ratings. The findings of the study indicated that self-ratings of OCB were significantly higher than superior-ratings of OCB. On the other hand, results revealed that superior-ratings of <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> were significantly higher than self-ratings. Staff nurses also were found to have positive feeling towards their workplace and felt that their participation in the hospitals is good. When both self-ratings of OCB and <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> were used in the analysis, 11 % of the variance in <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> was accounted for by OCB. Altruism, courtesy, conscientiousness, and civic virtue were significantly related to <b>job</b> <b>performance.</b> When both superior-ratings of OCB and <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> were used in the analysis, 26 % of the variance in <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> was accounted for by OCB. Altruism, courtesy, conscientiousness, and sportsmanship were significantly related to <b>job</b> <b>performance.</b> Further, the results indicated that work environment has partial mediation effect on the relationship between OCB and <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> when both self-ratings of OCB and <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> were used in the analysis. Furthermore, about 12. 3 % of the total effect of OCB on <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> was mediated by work environment...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} how personality characteristics affect <b>job</b> <b>performance,</b> and the mediating effects of <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> in the personality interaction-emotional exhaustion relation. Specifically, I hypothesized that neuroticism and conscientiousness {{would have an}} interactive effect on emotional exhaustion and that <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> would mediate that relation. Customer service employees employed in a Chinese call center participated and completed a questionnaire assessing personality and emotional exhaustion. As expected, analyses revealed that conscientiousness predicted <b>job</b> <b>performance.</b> Findings also showed that customer service employees higher in conscientiousness or lower in neuroticism experienced {{a lower level of}} emotional exhaustion than those lower in conscientiousness or higher in neuroticism. Data supported the hypotheses that conscientiousness and neuroticism had an interactive effect on <b>job</b> <b>performance.</b> People higher in conscientiousness but lower in neuroticism achieved better <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> than those higher in both conscientiousness and neuroticism. Data did not support my hypotheses specifying that <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> mediated the conscientiousness-neuroticism interaction with emotional exhaustion...|$|R
40|$|<b>Job</b> <b>performance</b> {{is argued}} to be {{substantially}} influential to project performance. However, existing construction management literature pays {{less attention to}} <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> issues, not to mention exploring the relationship between <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> and project performance. This study therefore aims at examining the effects of <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> on project performance. Four categories (task, behavior, management, and self) of <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> dimensions were extracted {{by means of an}} exploratory factor analysis. A hypothesized model is developed, which specifies the relationships between the four <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> categories (independent variables) and overall project performance (the dependent variable). The model was tested using path analysis. Results indicate that the task category of <b>job</b> <b>performance</b> (consisting of nine dimensions) is significantly related to final project outcomes. Specifically, for the success of a project, a construction company must consider how to ensure employees are equipped with such attributes as responsibility, quality of work, ability, job knowledge, experience, efficiency, accuracy, judgment, and initiative.
