5|$|This {{restriction}} {{and kind}} of state monopoly {{on the use of}} national symbols during the Communist regime made flying the Polish flag a symbol of <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> the government. It became customary – and still is – for workers to hoist Polish flags on plant buildings when going on strike. This is why the Polish flag, as a symbol of patriotism and <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> the Communist rule, is part of the Solidarity trade union logo.|$|E

5|$|The French entered Damascus the {{following}} day, encountering little resistance. Soon afterward, Faisal {{was expelled from}} Syria.

5|$|The battle {{also had}} {{significant}} political repercussions, shaking the British Army's confidence. The {{fact that the}} siege had taken so long exposed the British forces' vulnerabilities and encouraged the native Indian states– in particular the old Maratha Confederacy in central India– to continue their <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> British imperialism {{in the hope that}} they could still be defeated.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} Rommel's {{involvement}} in the military's <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> Hitler or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain, as people most directly involved did not survive, and limited documentation of the conspirators' plans and preparations exists. Thus, Rommel's participation remains ambiguous, {{and the perception of}} it largely has its source in subsequent events, (especially Rommel's forced suicide), and the post-war accounts by surviving participants.|$|E
5|$|The revolting nobility had thus chosen Uroš {{as their}} {{candidate}} for king; from 1242 to spring 1243, a {{war for the}} throne was fought, which ended with Vladislav being forced {{to give up the}} crown in favour of Uroš. It seems that Uroš quickly captured Vladislav and held him in prison. The main <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> Uroš was led by Vladislav's wife, Beloslava. Beloslava spent some time exiled in Ragusa. The fact that she was the organizer of the <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> Uroš is known from an edict dated to the summer of 1243, in which the Ragusans swore to King Uroš that they would not support Beloslava's resistance work. Since Vladislav is not mentioned anywhere, it means that he was likely imprisoned.|$|E

5|$|When Histiaeus {{heard of}} the fall of Miletus, he seems to have {{appointed}} himself as leader of the <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> Persia. Setting out from Byzantium with his force of Lesbians, he sailed to Chios. The Chians refused to receive him, so he attacked and destroyed the remnants of the Chian fleet. Crippled by the two defeats at sea, the Chians then acquiesced to Histiaeus's leadership.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} is {{a recent}} innovation, consisting of some combination of paclitaxel (or other taxanes like docetaxel), doxorubicin (and other anthracyclines), and platins (particularly cisplatin and carboplatin). Adjuvant chemotherapy {{has been found to}} increase survival in stage III and IV cancer more than added radiotherapy. Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations. Side effects of chemotherapy are common. These include hair loss, low neutrophil levels in the blood, and gastrointestinal problems.|$|E

5|$|After {{receiving}} reinforcements, the British {{attempted to}} make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment. But Pontiac was ready and waiting, and defeated them at the Battle of Bloody Run on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the situation at Fort Detroit remained a stalemate, and Pontiac's influence among his followers began to wane. Groups of Native Americans began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid at Detroit, Pontiac lifted the siege and removed to the Maumee River, where he continued his efforts to rally <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> the British.|$|E
5|$|After the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Screen Writers Guild {{set up on}} December 8, 1941, the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to {{organize}} writers for the war effort. Rossen served as the body's chairman until 1944 and advocated {{the opening of a}} Second Front to support West European <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> the Nazis. His earnings were much greater than in 1937. However, his work for Hollywood Writers Mobilization and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly developed film projects, including The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which John Huston eventually directed in 1948.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the battle, Elara was the king of Anuradhapura. He was a Chola prince from South India, who had {{defeated}} the Sinhalese ruler Asela in an invasion. Although an invader, Elara is described as a just ruler who had even patronized Buddhism. Most of the country came under this Tamil king's rule, while his rival Kavan Tissa, a Sinhala king from Ruhunu in the south of the country, organized a <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> him. Kavan Tissa's son, Dutthagamani, ascended to the throne {{after the death of his}} father.|$|E

5|$|Buenos Aires {{and other}} nearby cities faced the British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1806 and 1807. In {{the absence of}} {{reinforcements}} from Spain, viceroy Santiago de Liniers arranged that everyone in Buenos Aires capable of bearing arms should join the <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> the second invasion. Larrea established the Legion of Catalan Volunteers with Jaime Nadal y Guarda, Jaime Lavallol and José Olaguer Reynals. Larrea was appointed captain of this military unit. The defense was successful, and the British were driven away from the viceroyalty.|$|E
5|$|Daoíz is commemorated as {{a leader}} of the initial <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> French rule in Spain and, along with Velarde, is remembered in many monuments across the country. The ashes of Daoíz and Velarde, with those of others {{involved}} in the Dos de Mayo uprising, were transferred to the Monumento a los Caidos por España in Madrid after its construction in 1840. The monument originally served as a memorial to those who lost their lives on the Dos de Mayo but on 22 November 1985 King Juan Carlos I redesignated it in memory of all Spaniards who died in war and it now serves as Spain's national Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.|$|E
5|$|During the Six-Day War in June 1967, Deir al-Balah's mayor Sulaiman al-Azayiza briefly led local <b>resistance</b> <b>against</b> the {{incoming}} Israeli Army until formally surrendering the city shortly thereafter. The Israeli authorities {{took control of}} the springs, an important irrigation source. This move combined with increasing competition from Israeli citrus farmers, damaged the local citrus industry. In 1982 the mayor was dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al-Balah was disbanded and replaced by an Israeli military-appointed administration. During the course of the Israeli occupation, Deir al-Balah's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture, {{largely as a result of}} building restrictions which hindered organized expansion.|$|E
