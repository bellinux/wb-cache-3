25|$|The {{anodized}} aluminum deck stepped mast and boom are aluminum type 6351 alloy {{and have}} integral sail slots and non-geared <b>roller</b> <b>reefing.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>Reefing</b> Sails, {{invented in}} 1789 by Stephen Hooper, use a canvas strip wound around a roller {{in the place}} of shutters. The mill {{does not have to be}} stopped in order to adjust the sails.|$|E
25|$|Patent Sails, {{invented in}} 1819 by William Cubitt, combine the {{shutters}} of the Spring Sail with the automatic adjustment of the <b>Roller</b> <b>Reefing</b> Sail. Single Patents have shutters on the trailing {{side of the}} sail, Double Patents have shutters {{on both sides of}} the sail for its whole length.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea for}} a furling jib is usually {{attributed}} to Major E du Boulay in England who invented a device similar to a <b>roller</b> blind for <b>reefing</b> a jib. Major Wykeham-Martin used one of Boulay's rollers and improved the system by incorporating roller bearings in 1907 when the system was patented. The original castings were made by London-based toilet makers Bouldings. By the 1940s nearly every British cruising yacht was fitted with this furling system.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{at least}} three Brisbane, Queensland based roller derby leagues {{including}} the Northern Brisbane Rollers, the Sun State Roller Girls and the Brisbane City Rollers. Roller derby leagues also exist in regional parts of Queensland including in Blackwater (Blackwater Roll-Her Derby), [...] Bundaberg (Rum City Derby Dolls), Mackay (Mackay City Roller Maidens), Townsville (Towns Villains <b>Roller</b> Derby), Cairns (<b>Reef</b> City Rollergirls), Gladstone (Gladstone Roller Derby), Gold Coast (Gold Coast Roller Derby), Rockhampton (Rocky Roller Derby), Toowoomba (Toowoomba City Rollers). and Hervey Bay Rollerz ...|$|R
25|$|Fiery Cross {{had been}} the first tea clipper home in 1861, 1862, 1863 and 1865. As a {{slightly}} older ship, built in 1860, she predated the widespread acceptance of composite construction, so was built of wood. Nevertheless, she was full of the latest technology; for example steel masts and Cunningham's patent <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> topsails and t'gallants.|$|E
2500|$|She {{was built}} in 1900 by Ferguson and Baird at their Connah's Quay, Flintshire yard, for local {{shipping}} company Coppack Bros. Constructed with a doubled frame of oak, these were covered by [...] thick seasoned pitch pine planks, fastened to the frames with treenails and iron bolts. Equipped with the first known fitting of Appledore <b>roller</b> <b>reefing,</b> the sails are reefed by a ratchet lever that engaged the cogs on the Gaff boom, thereby winding the sail around it, and then locked to prevent the sail unwinding from the boom. Launched in April 1900 under Captain John Coppack, she was named Lizzie May after the Captain’s daughters.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>reefing</b> sails {{were invented}} by Stephen Hooper in 1789. As with spring sails, the sail {{is divided into}} a number of bays, each with a number of spars with cloth wound around them. The cloth is {{extended}} or retracted by a rod and lever system, and connected with a shutter bar on each sail. Adjustment of the <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> sail can be made without stopping the mill. This type of sail was popular in Yorkshire, although the only remaining mill with <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> sails intact is Ballycopeland Windmill in Northern Ireland.|$|E
50|$|The Illusion is a one-design, single-handed keelboat {{based on}} {{the lines of a}} 12-metre yacht. Its {{features}} include foot pedal steering, genoa <b>roller</b> <b>reefing,</b> full trimming facilities, large buoyancy tanks, and car-top mounting. It was designed by Jo Richards and Neil Graham in 1981.|$|E
50|$|Patent sails {{were invented}} by William Cubitt in 1807. They combine the {{shutters}} {{of the spring}} sail with automatic adjustment of the <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> sail. Their construction {{is similar to that}} of the spring sail. Adjustment of patent sails can be made without stopping the mill.|$|E
50|$|<b>Roller</b> <b>reefing</b> rolls or wraps {{the sail}} around a wire, foil, or spar {{to reduce its}} {{exposure}} to the wind. In mainsail furling systems the sail is either wrapped around the boom by a mechanism in the gooseneck or hardware inside the boom winds it around a rotating foil.|$|E
50|$|The Swan 38 was {{designed}} by Olin Stephens and first launched in 1974. The first 9 hulls were fitted with in boom <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> and later boat with slab reefing with 116 boats built in total. There were two rig plans with one ton and a taller IOR Mk3 version also produced.|$|E
50|$|Furling systems {{controlled}} {{with lines}} {{led to the}} cockpit allow reefing without crew having to go on deck in heavy weather. <b>Roller</b> <b>reefing</b> also allows more variable sail area than conventional or jiffy reefing. Countering these advantages are the furled sail possibly not having an optimal shape and sail repair or replacement being more difficult.|$|E

50|$|Most serious {{cruising}} boats, {{even if only}} day-cruising, set dedicated cruising sails; {{these are}} constructed differently from racing sails and from heavier but more supple cloth, and are nearly always equipped with a means of reefing. The original design, with the small jib, provided for square gooseneck <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> for the main; modern boats usually prefer slab/jiffy reefing for the main, and some set fully reefable genoas {{by means of a}} headsail reefing drum and associated equipment (including a reefing spar).|$|E
50|$|Holgate tower {{windmill}} {{was built}} in 1770 of brickstones by its first owner and miller George Waud. He, his son and grandson ran the mill until 1851, and a dwelling-house was erected around the same time. The mill was originally fitted with five <b>Roller</b> <b>Reefing</b> sails although these were later replaced by Double Patent sails. In 1841, the mill was described as having three pairs of French Burr millstones, two dressing machines and five Patent sails. A fourth pair of stones had been added by 1858.|$|E
50|$|Jiffy reefing, {{also called}} slab or single line reefing, is an {{alternative}} to conventional or <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> where the sail is folded in sections, or slabs, along the boom. One or two reefing lines reeved through the sail's luff and leach reef cringles create a new tack and clew for the sail by pulling those points tight to the boom. These can be led back to the cockpit to allow crew members to reef without going on deck in heavy weather. Intermediate reef cringles are not used.|$|E
5000|$|At 3000 lbs it {{included}} a 1250 lbs cast iron keel. Tempest 23 came standard with eight foot (8') Self-bailing cockpit, self-draining seats with storage, molded insulated ice box, Philippine mahogany trim, deck stepped mast, main <b>roller</b> <b>reefing,</b> full width mainsheet traveler, wirehalyards, two jib winches, separate galley and head enclosures, two (2) 6'6" [...] berths with storage, and a 2-year warranty.The sail plan {{consisted of a}} 115.00 sq. ft. mainsail, 113.10 sq. ft. jib and 339.00 sq. ft. spinnaker.

50|$|The Mirror 16 is a {{class of}} sailing dinghy which was {{sponsored}} by the Daily Mirror newspaper in 1963 and the design project was headed by Jack Holt. Its design was based upon the easy to construct stitch and glue principle introduced by Barry Bucknell for the Mirror 11 dinghy. The Mirror 16 was designed for the racing enthusiast and also the camping/potterer dinghy sailor. The concept was a relatively light dinghy with a large sail area that could easily be reefed. The main sail was designed for slab reefing and the large genoa had <b>roller</b> <b>reefing.</b> The Mirror 16, like the Mirror 11, was produced with distinctive red sails. The Mirror 16 was faster than the Proctor-designed Wayfarer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{vessel was}} {{initially}} {{designed as a}} cargo ship. The ship was of a medium clipper design which had an unusually sharp bow, tall masts and was broad amidships. The design was considered stable and able to withstand the punishment of the open sea. Marco Polo was a 184 ft long with a beam of 36 ft and a draught of 29 ft. The ship had a hold depth of 30 ft. Marco Polo weighed 1,625 tons. The ship was square rigged and fitted with the <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> system that allowed the sails to be reefed from the deck rather than have the crew go up into the sails. The vessel had three masts and carried up to [...] of sail. Marco Polo was later reduced to barque rig in 1874.|$|E
50|$|The oyster {{dredging}} sailboats of the Chesapeake Bay, bugeyes and skipjacks, were inevitably {{equipped with}} lazy jacks, as their huge sail plans, {{combined with the}} changeable conditions on the bay, made it necessary {{to be able to}} reef quickly and with a small crew. Of late they have been revived as a feature of pleasure yachts as an alternative to <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> and furling. The latter methods can distort the sail, and are not compatible with battens in the reefed or furled portion of the sail. Lazy jacks are also cheaper, and can be easily applied after-market. However, they are not without disadvantages. The extra lines provide something else for the sail to foul upon when it is being raised, particularly if it is battened, and the lines and the connections between them can chafe and beat upon the sail, shortening its life and making unwanted noise. Also, unlike the roller systems, some crew member(s) must be on deck to secure the sail.|$|E
50|$|Most R-22 {{boats are}} now {{equipped}} with Inner Mast Furling (IMF) {{as well as}} <b>roller</b> <b>reefing</b> jibs. The R-22 can be sailed single handed from the large, self-bailing cockpit. The cockpit features a flat floor bottom, comfortable seating, and an optional Boom Room. The boom can be raised or lowered, allowing the boat to be sailed with a Bimini top in place providing shade from the sun. The cabin features a partitioned V-berth, 4' long galley with stove and icebox, {{as well as an}} enclosed head. The cabin ceiling features two standing room hatches and an optional pop top and canvas enclosures. The sailboat also uses the swing keel as a self-centering feature when loading onto the trailer. Unlike most sailboats in its class, this boat features positive foam flotation that render it unsinkable, even if holed. The sturdy mast is supported by 9 stays and 9 chain plates: one forward jib stay, 3 stays on each side, and two back stays. The mast can remain upright with any broken stay, even the single forward jib stay. One R-22 boat was caught in hurricane-force winds in Long Island Sound and knocked down 3 times. The R-22 is unsinkable and self-righting, but hurricane-force winds tested its mettle. It broke one shroud and one stay, but was never de-masted and sailed back to Mamaroneck Harbor when the winds died to about 30 mph.|$|E
