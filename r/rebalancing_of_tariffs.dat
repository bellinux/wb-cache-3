40|$|In {{the course}} of {{encouraging}} competition in telecommunications markets, regulators in both Australia and the UK are developing proposals to impose accounting separation upon dominant incumbents. This paper examines the logic behind accounting separation {{as an alternative to}} structural separation. It discusses the various forms in which between accounting separation, accounting separation can be implemented and analyses the connections between accounting separation, the <b>rebalancing</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariffs,</b> the funding of universal service obligations and the structure of interconnection charges. The paper concludes that accounting separation has the potential to provide a transparent framework in which efficient competition can develop, but that its potential can only be demonstrated by practical experience. ...|$|E
40|$|For {{much of the}} 20 th {{century and}} in most countries, network utilities, such as telecommunications, electricity, natural gas, railroads, and water supply, were {{vertically}} and horizontally integrated state monopolies under ministerial control. This approach often led to extremely weak infrastructure services, especially in developing and transition economies. Common problems included low productivity, high costs, poor quality, chronic revenue shortages and falling investments, long waits for and shortages of services, and nonpayment for and theft of services. As {{a result of these}} problems, public policies toward infrastructure have undergone profound changes over the past two decades. This report evaluates the privatization of network utilities in developing and transition economies using three criteria: the resulting levels of investment (and thus service expansion), operating (technical) efficiency, and allocative efficiency (as indicated by the <b>rebalancing</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariffs).</b> This report also assesses the distributional consequences of reforms, especially their effects on basic services for poor households and other disadvantaged groups. The report suggests designing pricing policies that strike a balance between economic efficiency and social equity, developing rules governing access to bottleneck infrastructure facilities, and finding new ways to increase poor people's access to services.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{different aspects}} of the liberalisation and simultaneous economic regulation of network utilities in the European Union. Two groups of arguments justify that regulation is maintained in these industries after the removal of barriers to competitive entry. The first group of arguments is linked to the natural monopoly characteristics displayed by such services. These imply that competition cannot be relied upon to restrain the dominant position of network operators. The second group of arguments relates to the social dimension, or public service nature, of utility services. The essential role played by these services justifies government intervention in form of price controls, universal service obligations and other qualitative regulations. The thesis has two parts of different nature, each part comprising two chapters. In the first part, an introductory chapter describes the framework within which the economic regulation of network utilities is inscribed, and discusses key trade-offs between different regulatory policy objectives. The second chapter analyses how the regulatory framework for liberalised network industries developed in the UK compares to the framework in place in Germany. Germany has embarked on reform of its network utilities considerably later than the UK, and displays unique characteristics in its industry structures, in particular a strong federal element. The German case illustrates how the general economic principles underlying the liberalisation and regulation process are interpreted in the European environment, and are adapted to national characteristics. The second part of the thesis focuses on specific aspects of liberalisation and regulation using econometric techniques. In chapter 3, access price elasticities in the fixed telephony industry are estimated {{on the basis of a}} pseudo-panel. The main question addressed is whether the <b>rebalancing</b> <b>of</b> <b>tariffs</b> that has taken place in the wake of liberalisation has had the potential to deteriorate household access to the fixed telephone network. The last and fourth chapter looks at patterns and determinants of supplier switching in the domestic gas and electricity markets in Great Britain using data from a true household panel. Its main conclusion is that the likelihood of supplier switching is influenced more strongly by variables linked to cost savings than by socio-demographic factors such as income...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} a mechanism that provides incentives to promote transmission network expansion in the electricity system of the Ontario province. Such a mechanism combines a merchant approach with a regulatory approach. It {{is based on the}} <b>rebalancing</b> <b>of</b> a two-part <b>tariff</b> within the framework of a wholesale electricity market with nodal pricing. The expansion of the network is carried out through auctions of financial transmission rights for congested links. The mechanism is tested for a simplified transmission grid with ten interconnected zones, ten nodes, eleven lines and seventy eight generators in the Ontario province. The simulation is carried out for both peak and non-peak scenarios. Considering Laspeyres weights, the results show that that prices converge to the marginal cost of generation, the congestion rent decreases, and the total social welfare increases. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{performance}} of different regulatory approaches {{for the expansion of}} electricity transmission networks in the light of realistic demand patterns and fluctuating wind power. In particular, we are interested in the relative performance of a combined merchant-regulatory mechanism compared to a cost-based and a merchant-like approach. In contrast to earlier research, we explicitly include both an hourly time resolution and fluctuating wind power, which allows representing demand in a very realistic way. This substantially increases the real-world applicability of results compared to previous analyses, which were based on simplifying assumptions. We show that a combined merchant-regulatory regulation, which draws on a cap over the two-part <b>tariff</b> <b>of</b> the Transco, leads to welfare outcomes far superior to the modeled alternatives. This result proves to be robust over a range of different cases and sensitivity analyses. We also find that the intertemporal <b>rebalancing</b> <b>of</b> the two-part <b>tariff</b> carried out by the Transco so as to expand the network is such that the fixed tariff part turns out to be relatively large compared to extension costs.

40|$|The policy <b>of</b> <b>rebalancing</b> <b>tariffs</b> in {{the newly}} liberalised {{telecommunications}} market {{has given rise to}} concerns about universal service issues. The rise of connection and rental charges threatens {{to increase the number of}} disconnections and burden low-income groups in a disproportionate manner. In order to assess the validity of these fears, we estimate a telephone access demand model based on UK houshold data. We use a pseudo-panel technique to account for the repeated cross-section nature of the data. Our reseulats of small, but significant price elasticities with respect to connection charges, line rental, and household income are consistent with evidence from North America. Furthermore, we find a significant differential in the elasticity measured between high- and low-income groups. universal service; telephone access; pseudo-panel data...|$|R

40|$|Multi-period {{guarantees}} {{are often}} embedded in life insurance contracts. In this paper {{we consider the}} problem of hedging these multi-period guarantees {{in the presence of}} transaction costs. We derive the hedging strategies for the cheapest hedge portfolio for a multi-period guarantee that with certainty makes the insurance company able to meet the obligations from the insurance policies it has issued. We find that by imposing transaction costs, the insurance company reduces the <b>rebalancing</b> <b>of</b> the hedge portfolio. The cost of establishing the hedge portfolio also increases as the transaction cost increases. For the multi-period guarantee there is a rather large <b>rebalancing</b> <b>of</b> the hedge portfolio as we go from one period to the next. By introducing transaction costs we find the size <b>of</b> this <b>rebalancing</b> to be reduced. Transaction costs may therefore be one possible explanation for why we do not see the insurance companies performing a large <b>rebalancing</b> <b>of</b> their investment portfolio {{at the end of each}} year. ...|$|R

More specifically, a ten percentage point decrease in tariffs reduces the wage premium by 1. 1 %.
