25|$|Because the Earth's tides are {{ultimately}} due to gravitational {{interaction with the}} Moon and Sun and the Earth's rotation, tidal power is practically inexhaustible and classified as a <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resource.</b> Movement of tides causes a loss of mechanical energy in the Earth–Moon system: this {{is a result of}} pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent viscous dissipation at the seabed and in turbulence. This loss of energy has caused the rotation of the Earth to slow in the 4.5billion years since its formation. During the last 620million years the period of rotation of the earth (length of a day) has increased from 21.9hours to 24hours; in this period the Earth has lost 17% of its rotational energy. While tidal power will take additional energy from the system, the effect is negligible and would only be noticed over millions of years.|$|E

30|$|The green {{computing}} initiative also embodies sustainability in operations. Cloud {{data centers}} operating on <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> lead to zero GHG emissions. <b>Renewable</b> <b>energy</b> from {{sources such as}} {{the sun and the}} wind can be generated from on-site installations or purchased from off-site corporations [4]. The main drawbacks of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> based cloud data center operations are the associated cost and unpredictable supply of the renewable resource. It is estimated that with the advances in storage capacities, the cost/Watt of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> will halve in the next decade [17]. Moreover, to address the unpredictability of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources,</b> techniques such as dynamic power-workload balancing and server power capping are exploited [1]. The integration of <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> to cloud data center power designs requires utilization of hybrid power supplies and Autonomic Transfer Switches (ATS).
