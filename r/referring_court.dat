50|$|The <b>referring</b> <b>Court,</b> inter alia, {{asked whether}} the {{prohibition}} of any discrimination based on age in employment and occupation must be interpreted as meaning that it precluded national legislation such as that in the main proceedings, pursuant to which compulsory retirement clauses contained in collective agreements were regarded as lawful, where such clauses provided as sole requirements that workers must have reached retirement age, set at 65 years by the national legislation, and must fulfil the other social security conditions for entitlement to draw a contributory retirement pension.|$|E

50|$|A {{preliminary}} ruling {{is a decision}} of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) on the interpretation of European Union law, made {{at the request of}} a court or tribunal of a European Union member state. Preliminary rulings are final determinations of Union law in question by the EU courts. The final decision remains with the <b>referring</b> <b>court</b> to be decided after it received the {{preliminary ruling}}. European Union preliminary rulings can only be made by the European Court of Justice. The Treaty of Lisbon provided that jurisdiction may be conferred on the General Court, but this has not been put into effect.|$|E
50|$|Although the Nuremberg Court {{relied on}} the {{presumption}} that Mr. Vatsouras and Mr. Koupatantze were not workers {{within the meaning of}} article 45 TFEU, the European Court of Justice nonetheless expanded {{on the question of whether}} or not they should have been qualified as workers. The <b>referring</b> <b>court</b> came to the conclusion that they were not workers on the grounds that Mr. Vatsouras' professional activity did not ensure him a livelihood, and Mr. Koupatantze's employment lasted barely over one month. The short lived and low paid nature of employment therefore prevented a qualification as 'worker' within the meaning of article 45 TFEU.|$|E
5000|$|In Cases E-15/15 and 16/15, Vienna Life and Swiss Life, the Court {{ruled on}} the {{interpretation}} of Directive 2002/83/EC concerning life assurance. It held that Article 36(1) of the Directive does not address legal transactions according to which an existing unit-linked life assurance policy is transferred via a purchase agreement {{from one person to}} another where the insured risk, namely the insured person, under the assurance policy remains the same. Furthermore, a transfer of a unit-linked life assurance policy does not constitute a change in the policy conditions under Article 36(2) unless the terms of an assurance policy are also amended, thereby altering the balance of rights and obligations of the parties to an assurance contract. With regard to the referring court’s further questions on specific information duties under the Directive, the Court found, first, that if a “change in the policy conditions” within the meaning of the Directive has taken place, the <b>referring</b> <b>court</b> needs to consider whether the information listed in Annex III(B)(b)(2) was provided to the second-hand policy holder in a clear, accurate and complete manner and in an official language of the EEA State of commitment. Second, it is of no significance for the information obligation of the assurance undertaking whether the former policy holder was an undertaking and the new policy holder is a consumer, unless this difference has led to an amendment to the terms of the assurance contract. Neither is it of significance whether or not the original policy holder disclosed information about himself so that his own risk or investor profile could be assessed. As to the referring court’s question whether Annex III to the Directive has been correctly transposed into Liechtenstein law, the Court held that directives must be implemented into the national legal order of the EEA States with unquestionable binding force and the specificity, precision and clarity necessary to satisfy the requirements of legal certainty. Furthermore, national courts are bound to interpret national law in conformity with EEA law. Under Article 34 SCA, the Court has jurisdiction to give advisory opinions on {{the interpretation of}} the EEA Agreement upon the request of national courts. After the Court has rendered its judgment, it falls to the <b>referring</b> <b>court</b> to interpret national law in light of the Court’s findings. In cases where a harmonious interpretation of national law is not sufficient to achieve the result sought by the relevant EEA rule, that matter can be brought before the Court under the procedure prescribed by Article 31 SCA.|$|E

40|$|In {{providing}} preliminary rulings on {{the interpretation}} of EU law, the European Court of Justice carries out essentially review of constitutionality of Member State action. The ECJ enjoys discretion in determining the specificity of its ruling. It may give an answer so specific that it leaves the <b>referring</b> <b>court</b> no margin for maneuver and provides it with a ready-made solution to the dispute (outcome cases); it may, alternatively, provide the <b>referring</b> <b>court</b> with guidelines {{as to how to}} resolve the dispute (guidance cases); finally, it may answer the question in such general terms that, in effect, it defers to the national judiciary (deference cases). The degree of specificity is not a random exercise but a conscious judicial choice. The ECJâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s discretion in this respect operates as a constitutional valve and illustrates the direct use of judicial power.

40|$|In the 1980 s, in {{the midst}} of the AIDS epidemic, many {{countries}} introduced lifetime bans on blood donations by men who had sexual relations with men (MSM). These blanket bans have, recently, begun to be challenged and, as a result, many countries have either relaxed them or completely abolished them. The case under examination (Léger) is another instance of questioning the legality of such a ban. In particular, in this case, the European Court of Justice was called on to rule on whether a measure such as the French lifetime exclusion from blood donation of the MSM population that was at issue before the <b>referring</b> <b>court</b> is contrary to EU law. The Court ruled that although discriminatory on the ground of sexual orientation, such a ban may be justified in certain circumstances, and left it to the national court to make the final decision.

40|$|The Court (Grand Chamber) {{ruled that}} Article 49 TFEU must be {{interpreted}} as not precluding, in principle, national legislation, such as that at issue in the cases before the <b>referring</b> <b>court</b> (Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Asturias), which imposes some restrictions {{on the issue of}} licences for the opening of new pharmacies (i. e. establishment of limits based on population density or minimum distance between pharmacies). Nevertheless, Article 49 TFEU precludes such national legislation in so far as the basic ‘ 2 800 inhabitants’ and ‘ 250 metres’ rules prevent, in any geographical area which has special demographic features, the establishment of a sufficient number of pharmacies to ensure adequate pharmaceutical services, that being a matter for the national court to ascertain. The answer to {{the second part of the}} questions referred by the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Asturias was that Article 49 TFEU, read in conjunction with Article 1 (1) and (2) of Directive 85 / 432 /EC and Article 45 (2) (e) and (g) of Directive 2005 / 36 /EC, {{must be interpreted}} as precluding discriminatory criteria, such as those set out in points 6 and 7 (c) of the Annex to Decree 72 / 2001 (Asturias), under which licensees for new pharmacies are to be selected...|$|E
40|$|Regulation 1896 / 2006 {{does not}} provide for {{effective}} debtor protection in cases when a European Order for Payment was not properly served on the debtor. As {{a result of the}} unilateral nature of the procedure for issuing the order, the order will be declared enforceable if the defendant does not challenge it within a period of 30 days. However, the service of the payment order shall safeguard the right to a defense. When the defendant has never been informed about the ongoing procedure, {{he should be able to}} easily contest the Order for Payment even after it has been declared enforceable. Yet, the text of the Regulation {{does not provide}} for a remedy in this situation. In a reference for a preliminary ruling, the Local Court Berlin-Wedding asked the European Court of Justice which remedy should apply. The <b>referring</b> <b>court</b> suggested an application by analogy of the review proceedings provided for in Article 20 of Regulation 1896 / 2006 in order to ensure an effective right to a defense. Regrettably, the CJEU did not endorse this solution. It declared national procedural law applicable in accordance with Article 26 of the Regulation. As a consequence, parties are sent to the fragmented remedies of national procedural laws. As the efficiency and uniform application of Regulation 1896 / 2006 is no longer guaranteed, the European lawmaker is called to remedy the insufficient situation.

40|$|Structuralism is {{a theory}} of U. S. {{constitutional}} adjudication according to which courts should seek to improve the decision-making process of the political branches of government so as to render it more democratic. 1 In words of John Hart Ely, courts should exercise their judicial-review powers as a ‘representation-reinforcing’ mechanism. 2 Structuralism advocates that courts must eliminate {{the elements of the}} political decision-making process that are at odds with the structure set out by the authors of the U. S. Constitution. The advantage of this approach, U. S. scholars posit, {{lies in the fact that}} it does not require courts to second-guess the policy decisions adopted by the political branches of government. Instead, they limit themselves to enforcing the constitutional structure within which those decisions must be adopted. Of course, this theory of constitutional adjudication, like all theories, has its shortcomings. For example, detractors of structuralism argue that it is difficult, if not impossible, to draw the dividing line between ‘substantive’ and ‘structural’ matters. 3 In particular, they claim that, when identifying the ‘structure’ set out by the authors of the U. S. Constitution, courts necessarily base their determinations not on purely structural principles, but on a set of substantive values, evaluating concepts such as democracy, liberty and equality. 4 Without claiming that structuralism should be embraced by the ECJ as the leading theory of judicial review, the purpose of my contribution is to explore how recent case-law reveals that the ECJ has also striven to develop guiding principles which aim to improve the way in which the political institutions of the EU adopt their decisions. In those cases, the ECJ decided not to second-guess the appropriateness of the policy choices made by the EU legislator. Instead, it preferred to examine whether, in reaching an outcome, the EU political institutions had followed the procedural steps mandated by the authors of the Treaties. Stated simply, I argue that judicial deference in relation to ‘substantive outcomes’ has been counterbalanced by a strict ‘process review’. To that effect, I would like to discuss three recent rulings of the ECJ, delivered after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, where an EU policy measure was challenged indirectly, i. e. via the preliminary reference procedure, namely Vodafone, Volker und Markus Schecke and Test-Achats. 5 Whilst in the former case the ECJ ruled that the questions raised by the <b>referring</b> <b>court</b> disclosed no factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of the challenged act, in the latter cases the challenged provisions of an EU act were declared invalid...|$|E

Aktualios Europos Sąjungos Teisingumo Teismo jurisprudencijos analizė turi padėti atskleisti ir galimas jos raidos tendencijas. The article {{analyses}} {{the changes}} of {{jurisdiction of the}} Court of Justice of the European Union after the coming into force of the Treaty of Lisbon to give preliminary rulings in the proceedings launched where a national court submits a reference for preliminary ruling when considering a criminal matter {{as well as on}} a request from a national court to interpret a legal act of the European Union or deliver an opinion on its validity. In addition, it investigates the preliminary ruling, the requirements to fulfil when presenting procedural documents, and conditions of applying special measures in organizing the proceedings. The analysis of the relevant case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union will also help to reflect the potential trends of its future development. On the basis of the analysis of the case-law of the Court of Justice, the following conclusion is made: after the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and expiry of the transitional period, no restrictions have been left for national courts (irrespective of their position in the national legislative system) to submit a reference for a preliminary ruling before the Court of Justice of the European Union where preliminary questions are related to the area of freedom, security and justice, therefore, the following trend arises: national courts more often decide to use this opportunity of cooperation with the Court also when a criminal case is pending before a national court. In the process of a preliminary ruling the role of a national court is very important, as it, requesting for a preliminary ruling, not only initiates the opening of the process, but also the quality of procedural documents submitted by a <b>referring</b> <b>court</b> may determine the progress, duration and result of the proceedings. Therefore, the requirements and stipulations laid down accordingly in Article 94 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice and Recommendations to national courts in relation to the initiation of preliminary ruling proceedings are very important. An active use of national courts of a possibility to submit a reference for a preliminary ruling to the Court of Justice in cases where there are doubts as regards interpretation of the European Union legal acts in considering criminal cases and the preliminary rulings of the Court of Justice contributes to the attaining of one of the main objectives laid down in Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union: to ensure uniform interpretation and application of the European Union law throughout the Union...|$|E

In general, the probability of a self-reported offense being followed by a court referral was similar for boys and girls, indicating that male offenders {{were more likely to be}} <b>referred</b> to <b>court</b> primarily because they committed more offenses than female offenders. The exception was that boys were more likely to be <b>referred</b> to <b>court</b> after each aggressive offense, but this gender difference disappeared after taking into account that boys were more rebellious, more likely to be gang members, and more likely to carry guns.
