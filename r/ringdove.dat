40|$|International audienceMelatonin is {{involved}} in the regulation of both cellular and humoral immunity. In the present study we have evaluated the effect of the oral administration of melatonin and its precursor, the amino acid tryptophan, on humoral immune response in <b>ringdoves</b> () from different age groups. Male and female <b>ringdoves</b> of 4 - 5 years of age (young) and 12 - 14 years of age (old) were used in this study. The animals received a single capsule of 300 mg/kg b. w. of tryptophan (old animals) for 3 consecutive days one hour after lights on or a single oral dose (0. 25 or 2. 5 mg/kg body weight/ 0. 1 ml per animal/day, young and old animals respectively) of melatonin, for 3 consecutive days 1 hr before lights off. Blood samples were taken before beginning the treatment (basal values) {{and at the end of}} the treatment. Immunoglobulins, bactericidal and haemolytic activity were measured. Our results show that in old animals the humoral immune response was reduced with respect to the young. Both melatonin and tryptophan treatment increased the immunoglobulin concentration, with the nocturnal values being significantly higher than diurnal values and with a major effect in old animals. The bactericidal activity of the serum against after the treatment with melatonin or tryptophan, was increased at night with a greater effect in old animals. No significant differences were observed in the haemolytic activity of the serum in young animals, but there was an increase in old animals, with higher values at night after treatment with melatonin. In general, the oral administration of melatonin or tryptophan produced a stimulation of humoral immune response with greater effects in old <b>ringdoves...</b>|$|R
25|$|On 2 June 1813 she sailed for the North America station. On 30 June {{she was one}} of {{the vessels}} that were present at the capture of the letter of marque Ulysses, Sam Hill, Master. Ulysses, of Massachusetts, carried eight guns and a crew of 30.

25|$|The Admiralty sold <b>Ringdove</b> to Samuel Cunard & Co. at Halifax for £505 on 11 June 1829. Cunard was a Nova Scotian {{who built}} up a fleet of 40 sailing vessels before {{founding}} the Cunard Line in 1840.|$|E
25|$|Next day, two brigs, {{which turned}} out to be the Excise vessel Royal George and Sappho, were chasing a French lugger when Ariadne and <b>Ringdove</b> came on the scene. Royal George, J.T. Currie (or Curry), Commander, then {{captured}} the French lugger, which was the privateer Eglee (or Eglé), under the command of M. Olivier. She was armed with 16 guns, all 3 or 4-pounders, and had left Dunkirk on 31 December. She had made one capture, the brig Gabriel, of Yarmouth, which she had taken the night before and scuttled. Captain A. Farquhar of Ariadne saw Gabriel still floating and dispatched <b>Ringdove</b> to investigate. Andrews reported that the brig was sinking so fast that it was impossible to save her. However, Gabriel's Master and crew were aboard Eglé. Farquhar then sent Trente et Quarante and Eglé into Yarmouth.|$|E
40|$|Aging {{is known}} to alter the {{circadian}} rhythms of melatonin, serotonin, thermoregulatory responses, cytokine production, and sleep/wakefulness which affect sleep quality. We tested the possible palliative effects of a 3 -day administration of melatonin (0. 25 or 2. 5 mg/kg of body weight [b. w. ] to young and old <b>ringdoves,</b> respectively) or tryptophan (300 mg/kg of b. w. to old <b>ringdoves)</b> on these rhythms. Doves are a monophasic, diurnal species; these characteristics are similar in humans. Old animals presented lower melatonin and serotonin levels; higher interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha values; and reductions in the Midline-Estimating Statistic of Rhythm and amplitude of activity–rest rhythm and in the amplitude of the core temperature rhythm. Melatonin raised serum melatonin levels; tryptophan increased both melatonin and serotonin levels. Melatonin and tryptophan lowered nocturnal activity, core temperature, and cytokine levels and increased peripheral temperature in both groups. Melatonin or tryptophan may limit or reverse {{some of the changes}} that occur in sleep–wake rhythms and temperature due to age...|$|R
60|$|Six weeks {{had gone}} by since the eventful evening of Benita's arrival at Rooi Krantz. Now the spring had fully come, the veld was emerald with grass and bright with flowers. In the kloof behind the house trees had put out their leaves, and the mimosas were in bloom, making the air heavy with their scent. Amongst them the <b>ringdoves</b> nested in hundreds, and on the steep rocks of the precipice the red-necked {{vultures}} fed their young. Along {{the banks of the}} stream and round the borders of the lake the pig-lilies bloomed, a sheet of white. All the place was beautiful and full of life and hope.

25|$|Later in 1808 <b>Ringdove</b> {{came under}} the {{temporary}} command of Lieutenant George Peak and was deployed to the Shetland Islands. Within a few weeks, Peak had captured the Danish privateer Forden Shieold (or Torden Skiöld) off Bergen, Norway on 30 March. She was only four hours out of port. Initially Forden Shieold would not surrender {{but after a few}} shots from <b>Ringdove</b> had killed one man and wounded two others she struck. The bad weather prevented Peak from taking her crew of 62 men prisoners until the next day. The privateer was pierced for 14 guns, but only carried ten 6-pounder guns. She had already captured five prizes in voyages over the previous four months. Peak was commended for his capture and the crew received prize money for the hull, stores and head money at Leith the following October.|$|E

60|$|As Rachel spoke {{a puff of}} {{wind blew}} down the donga, rolling up the mist before it, and of a sudden shining above them they saw the glorious sun. As though by magic {{butterflies}} appeared basking upon the rain-shattered lily blooms; bright birds flitted from tree to tree, <b>ringdoves</b> began to coo. The terror of the tempest and the darkness of night were overpast; the world awoke again to life and love and joy. Instantly this change reflected itself in their young hearts. They whose natures had as it were ripened prematurely in the stress of danger and the shadow of death, became children once again. The very real emotions that they had experienced were forgotten, or at any rate sank into abeyance. Now they thought, not of separation or of the dim, mysterious future that stretched before them, but only of how they should ford the stream and gain its further side, where Rachel saw her father, Tom, the driver, and the other Kaffirs, and Richard saw his horse which he had feared was lost.|$|R
40|$|Ageing is {{commonly}} {{accompanied by a}} chronic subclinical inflammatory status that coexists with immunedysfunction. Consumption of foods rich in antioxidants {{is associated with a}} lower incidence of chronicdiseases. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of the consumption of a Jerte Valley cherry-basedbeverage on the inflammatory load in two different animal species: rats and <b>ringdoves</b> (Streptopelia risoria);each divided into two age groups. To this purpose, circulating levels of both pro-inflammatory (IL- 1 β andTNF-α) and anti-inflammatory (IL- 4 and IL- 2) cytokines were measured before and after a 10 -day treatmentwith the Jerte Valley cherry-based beverage. Our results suggest that the 10 -day treatment with the JerteValley cherry-based beverage modulated the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in both rats andringdoves by down-regulating the levels of pro-inflammatory (IL- 1 β and TNF-α) cytokines and up-regulatingthe levels of anti-inflammatory (IL- 4 and IL- 2) cytokines. Moreover, old animals showed imbalanced levelsof inflammatory markers towards a pro-inflammatory status, thereby underlining the fact that ageing is usuallyaccompanied by systemic inflammation and inflammation-related chronic diseases. In conclusion, since anincreased dietary intake of vegetable-derived bioactive compounds may retard age-related immunedysfunctions and prolong life-span, supplementing diets with the cherry-based beverage may reduce theinflammatory load by modulating the serum concentrations of some markers of inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Aging is {{associated}} with an increased production of free radicals and alterations in the mechanisms of adaptation to stress. A number of studies have shown a causal connection between age-related oxidant/antioxidant imbalance and the diminution of an organism’s melatonin levels in old age. Restoration of this rhythm may contribute to the re-stabilization of cellular homeostasis. The present work was aimed at examining the effect of the administration of melatonin or its precursor, the amino acid tryptophan, on heterophil lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in heterophils from young (4 – 5  year) and old (12 – 14  year) <b>ringdoves</b> (Streptopelia risoria) under both basal and antigen-induced (stressful) conditions. Young animals were treated for 3 consecutive days with a single daily oral dose (0. 25  mg) of melatonin at 1900  hours while old animals were treated for 3 consecutive days with either an oral dose (2. 5  mg) of melatonin at 1900  hours or an oral capsule of 300  mg/kg body weight of l-tryptophan at 0900  hours. Non-treated old animals presented lower circulating levels of melatonin at night and higher levels of malonaldehyde (MDA) both day and night when compared to young birds. In both age groups, LPO levels were lower at night than during the day. Melatonin or tryptophan treatments significantly increased serum melatonin levels, reinforced SOD activity, and reduced MDA levels induced by the antigen. Melatonin and tryptophan may be useful agents for the treatment of disease states and processes in which an excessive production of oxidative damage occurs...|$|R
25|$|On 15 December Scorpion sailed from Basseterre {{with a small}} {{squadron}} {{in search}} of a French squadron reported to be in the area. In subsequent days two sloops and two frigates joined the squadron. One of the sloops was <b>Ringdove,</b> a sister-ship to Scorpion. Though a part of the squadron, Scorpion apparently missed out on the Action of 17 December 1809 in which a British squadron, first under Vashon Ballard and then under Captain Samuel James Ballard, destroyed two French frigates.|$|E
500|$|At {{daylight}} on 17 December, Blonde sighted the French flûtes approaching Basse-Terre {{from the}} northwest and Ballard advanced on them, blocking them from reaching Basse-Terre. Retreating northwest along the southern coastline of Guadeloupe, the flûtes entered a sheltered cove named Anse la Barque at 10:00, sheltering under two batteries {{on either side of}} the bay. Lieutenants Normand-Kergré and Vincent then anchored their ships parallel with the shore, so that they had the maximum number of cannon aimed at the entrance to the cove. As Ballard's ships cruised along the coast in light winds, seeking a way into the well-protected anchorage, other batteries opened fire, one striking <b>Ringdove</b> off Pointe Lizard. Captain William Dowers of <b>Ringdove</b> then landed a shore party from his ship and stormed the battery, capturing it in 15 minutes. He demolished the position and withdrew to his ship, rejoining Ballard off Anse la Barque. Ballard then tested the feasibility of an attack on the French ships, ordering the 12-gun schooner [...] to assess the depth of the entrance to the bay while he in Blonde attacked the batteries directly at 16:00. Discovering that the entrance was navigable. Blonde and Elizabeth withdrew out of range. Operations were then suspended for the evening to allow additional reinforcements to come up.

60|$|This, then, {{is to be}} a story, may it please you, {{in which}} jackdaws will wear {{peacocks}}' feathers, and awaken the just ridicule of the peacocks; in which, while every justice is done to the peacocks themselves, the splendour of their plumage, the gorgeousness of their dazzling necks, and the magnificence of their tails, exception will yet be taken to the absurdity of their rickety strut, and the foolish discord of their pert squeaking; in which lions in love will have their claws pared by sly virgins; in which rogues will sometimes triumph, and honest folks, let us hope, come by their own; in which there will be black crape and white favours; in which there will be tears under orange-flower wreaths, and jokes in mourning-coaches; in which there will be dinners of herbs with contentment and without, and banquets of stalled oxen where there is care and hatred--ay, and kindness and friendship too, along with the feast. It does not follow that all men are honest because they are poor; and I have known some who were friendly and generous, although they had plenty of money. There are some great landlords who do not grind down their tenants; there are actually bishops who are not hypocrites; there are liberal men even among the Whigs, and the Radicals themselves are not all aristocrats at heart. But who ever heard of giving the Moral before the Fable? Children are only led to accept the one after their delectation over the other: let us take care lest our readers skip both; and so let us bring them on quickly--our wolves and lambs, our foxes and lions, our roaring donkeys, our billing <b>ringdoves,</b> our motherly partlets, and crowing chanticleers.|$|R
60|$|The {{aspect of}} these Ghauts is picturesque. The {{primitive}} base consists of micaceous granite, with veins of porphyry and dykes of the purest white quartz: above lie strata of sandstone and lime, here dun, there yellow, or of a dull grey, often curiously contorted and washed clear of vegetable soil by the heavy monsoon. On these heights, which are mostly conoid with rounded tops, joined by ridges and saddlebacks, {{various kinds of}} Acacia cast a pallid and sickly green, like the olive tree upon the hills of Provence. They are barren in the cold season, and the Nomads migrate to the plains: when the monsoon covers them with rich pastures, the people revisit their deserted kraals. The Kloofs or ravines are the most remarkable features of this country: in some places the sides rise perpendicularly, like gigantic walls, the breadth varying from one hundred yards to half a mile; in others cliffs and scaurs, sapped at their foundations, encumber the bed, and not unfrequently a broad band of white sand stretches between two fringes of emerald green, delightful to look upon after the bare and ghastly basalt of Southern Arabia. The Jujube grows to a height already betraying signs of African luxuriance: through its foliage flit birds, gaudy-coloured as kingfishers, of vivid red, yellow, and changing-green. I remarked a long-tailed jay called Gobiyan or Fat [2], russet-hued <b>ringdoves,</b> the modest honey-bird, corn quails, canary-coloured finches, sparrows gay as those of Surinam, humming-birds with a plume of metallic lustre, and especially a white-eyed kind of maina, called by the Somal, Shimbir Load or the cow-bird. The Armo-creeper [3], with large fleshy leaves, pale green, red, or crimson, and clusters of bright berries like purple grapes, forms a conspicuous ornament in the valleys. There is {{a great variety of}} the Cactus tribe, some growing to the height of thirty and thirty-five feet: of these one was particularly pointed out to me. The vulgar Somal call it Guraato, the more learned Shajarat el Zakkum: it is the mandrake of these regions, and the round excrescences upon the summits of its fleshy arms are supposed to resemble men's heads and faces. On Tuesday the 5th December we arose at 6 A.M., after a night so dewy that our clothes were drenched, and we began to ascend the Wady Darkaynlay, which winds from east to south. After an hour's march appeared a small cairn of rough stones, called Siyaro, or Mazar [4], to which each person, in token of honor, added his quotum. The Abban opined that Auliya or holy men had sat there, but the End of Time more sagaciously conjectured that it was the site of some Galla idol or superstitious rite. Presently we came upon the hills of the White Ant [5], a characteristic feature in this part of Africa. Here the land has the appearance of a Turkish cemetery on a grand scale: there it seems like a city in ruins: in some places the pillars are truncated into a resemblance to bee-hives, in others they cluster together, suggesting the idea of a portico; whilst many of them, veiled by trees, and overrun with gay creepers, look like the remains of sylvan altars. Generally the hills are conical, and vary in height from four to twelve feet: they are counted by hundreds, and the Somal account for the number by declaring that the insects abandon their home when dry, and commence building another. The older erections are worn away, by wind and rain, to a thin tapering spire, and are frequently hollowed and arched beneath by rats and ground squirrels. The substance, fine yellow mud, glued by the secretions of the ant, is hard to break: it is pierced, sieve-like, by a network of tiny shafts. I saw these hills {{for the first time in}} the Wady Darkaynlay: in the interior they are larger and longer than near the maritime regions.|$|R
