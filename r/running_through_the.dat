5|$|A modern {{light rail}} system was {{proposed}} by the newly-formed Central Puget Sound Regional Transit Authority (RTA) in 1995, including a line <b>running</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Rainier Valley with a stop at South Othello Street. After the $6.7billion proposal was rejected by voters in March 1995, the RTA considered building a shorter elevated line on Rainier Avenue, including an option beginning at Columbia City, {{to the north of}} Othello, and ending in the University District. In November 1996, a condensed $3.9billion regional transit plan was approved by voters, including a light rail line between Seattle and Sea-Tac Airport <b>running</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> Rainier Valley, with an at-grade station on Martin Luther King Jr. Way South at South Othello Street.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{the first quarter}} making futile attempts at <b>running</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> middle of the Packer defense, the Buccaneers sent Jerry Eckwood around the left end for a 40-yard touchdown run. Eckwood ran for 99 yards, while Ricky Bell added another 97 {{on the way to}} a team-record 235 rushing yards.|$|E
5|$|On February 24, 2016, the MTA {{allocated}} $66 {{million to}} speed up the construction of the first phase so that it could open in December. However, by June, the project was not being built at a rate that would allow a December 2016 completion. Concerns about the line's timely opening persisted through October and November, with key systems such as elevators, escalators, and fire alarms not having been tested. The third rail was energized and test trains began <b>running</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> new line on October 9, 2016, with weights to simulate rush hour loads; non-revenue Q trains, taken out of service at 57th Street–Seventh Avenue, started <b>running</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> subway in November 2016.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{historian}} Stevan K. Pavlowitch, {{the bombing of}} Belgrade lasted three days. Other sources state the air battle over Belgrade lasted only two days owing to poor flying conditions on 8 April. The most important cultural institution that was destroyed was the National Library of Serbia, which was hit by bombs and gutted by fire. Hundreds of thousands of volumes, rare books, maps, and medieval manuscripts were destroyed. Also struck was the Belgrade Zoo, sending frightened animals <b>running</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets.|$|E
5|$|Business M-60 (Bus. M-60) {{is a state}} {{business}} spur <b>running</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> city of Niles {{and adjacent}} townships. The spur starts at the intersection with M-51 (Main Street, 11th Street) and runs eastward along a former routing of M-60 on Oak Street through a residential section of town. Near the Berrien–Cass county line, the highway passes south of the Jerry Tyler Memorial Airport. East of the airport, the street name changes from Oak Street to Yankee Road, and Bus. M-60 runs to its terminus at M-60 (Detroit Road). The total length is , and 5,284–7,984cars and 333trucks use the route each day.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{demolition}} of the tomb's chamber, some of the sarsens around the monument had been buried, while others had been left visible. Various buildings in Addington are partly made out of sarsen stone, {{some of which may}} have been removed from the long barrow. Ashbee also suspected that sarsens from this monument had been broken up for use in the repairs and extensions to the local church in the nineteenth century. The barrow was further damaged by the construction of the small road <b>running</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> middle of it.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of its}} extent, State Highway 34 {{passes through}} rural areas, <b>running</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> plains of western Oklahoma. The highway begins at SH-6 six miles (10km) {{northeast}} of Eldorado. Heading north from there, it intersects U.S. Route 62 (US-62) just east of Duke. The highway continues north into Greer County to its county seat of Mangum, where SH-34 joins US-283. Two miles (3km) north of Mangum, SH-9 joins for a four-mile (6km) concurrency with SH-34 and US-283. Thereafter, SH-9 splits off to the east.|$|E
5|$|From there north, it is a rural two-lane {{road that}} runs northeasterly through woodland.

5|$|M-89 is an east–west state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan {{that runs from}} near Ganges to Battle Creek. M-89 starts at an interchange with Interstate 196/US Highway31 (I-196/US31) and passes through Allegan, Kalamazoo County, Michigan, and Calhoun counties. The highway also briefly crosses {{the southwest corner of}} Barry County before it terminates an at intersection with Business Loop I-94 (BL I-94) on the northwestern side of downtown Battle Creek. In between the trunkline runs parallel to the Kalamazoo River through rural southwestern Michigan farmlands while also <b>running</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> middle of several smaller towns in the area.|$|E

Construction began later that year, with early work on Martin Luther King Jr. Way primarily consisting of utility relocation, property condemnation and reconstruction of the roadway. Station construction at the Edmunds Street station, since renamed Columbia City, began in September 2006 and was completed in 2008.
