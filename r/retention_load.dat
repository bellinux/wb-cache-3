40|$|PURPOSE To {{investigate}} the retention loads of differently fabricated secondary telescopic polyetheretherketone (PEEK) crowns on cobalt-chromium primary crowns with different tapers. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cobalt-chromium primary crowns with 0 °, 1 °, and 2 ° tapers were constructed, milled, and sintered. Corresponding secondary crowns were fabricated by milling, pressing from pellets, and pressing from granules. For these nine test groups, the pull-off tests of each crown combination were performed 20 times, and the retention loads were measured (Zwick 1445, 50 mm/min). Data {{were analyzed using}} linear regression, covariance analysis, mixed models, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann-Whitney U-test, together with the Benferroni-Holm correction. RESULTS The mixed models covariance analysis reinforced stable <b>retention</b> <b>load</b> values (p = 0. 162) for each single test sequence. There was no interaction between the groups and the separation cycles (p = 0. 179). Milled secondary crowns with 0 ° showed the lowest mean <b>retention</b> <b>load</b> values compared to all tested groups (p = 0. 003) followed by those pressed form pellets with 1 °. Regarding the different tapers, no effect of manufacturing method on the results was observed within 1 ° and 2 ° groups (p = 0. 540; p = 0. 052); however, among the 0 ° groups, the milled ones showed significantly the lowest <b>retention</b> <b>load</b> values (p = 0. 002). Among the manufacturing methods, both pressed groups showed no impact of taper on the <b>retention</b> <b>load</b> values (p > 0. 324 and p > 0. 123, respectively), whereas among the milled secondary crowns, the 0 ° taper showed significantly lower <b>retention</b> <b>load</b> values than the 1 ° and 2 ° taper (p < 0. 002). CONCLUSION Based on these results, telescopic crowns made of PEEK seem to show stable <b>retention</b> <b>load</b> values for each test sequence; however, data with thermo-mechanical aging are still required. In addition, further developments in CAD/CAM manufacturing of PEEK materials for telescopic crowns are warranted, especially for 0 °...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} <b>retention</b> <b>load</b> (RL) between ZrO 2 primary crowns and {{secondary}} polyetheretherketone (PEEK) crowns made by different fabrication methods {{with three different}} tapers. Standardized primary ZrO 2 crowns were fabricated with three different tapers: 0 °, 1 °, and 2 ° (n = 10 /group). Ten secondary crowns were fabricated (i) milled from breCam BioHPP blanks (PM); (ii) pressed from industrially fabricated PEEK pellets (PP) (BioHPP Pellet); or (iii) pressed from granular PEEK (PG) (BioHPP Granulat). One calibrated operator adjusted all crowns. In total, the RL of 90 secondary crowns were measured in pull-off tests at 50 mm/min, and each specimen was tested 20 times. Two- and one-way ANOVAs followed by a Scheffé’s post-hoc test were used for data analysis (p < 0. 05). Within crowns with a 0 ° taper, the PP group showed significantly higher <b>retention</b> <b>load</b> values compared with the other groups. Among the 1 ° taper, the PM group presented significantly lower retention loads than the PP group. However, the pressing type had {{no impact on the}} results. Within the 2 ° taper, the fabrication method had no influence on the RL. Within the PM group, the 2 ° taper showed significantly higher <b>retention</b> <b>load</b> compared with the 1 ° taper. The taper with 0 ° was in the same range value as the 1 ° and 2 ° tapers. No impact of the taper on the retention value was observed between the PP groups. Within the PG groups, the 0 ° taper presented significantly lower RL than the 1 ° taper, whereas the 2 ° taper showed no differences. The fabrication method of the secondary PEEK crowns and taper angles showed no consistent effect within all tested groups...|$|E

However, the quantification of their bonding properties on teeth is lacking. Therefore, {{the aim of}} this study was to determine the retention strength (RS) of differently pretreated new developed polymethylmethacrylate/ urethanedimethacrylate-based CAD/CAM polymer bonded on dentin. In summary, 120 human caries-free molars were prepared, and polymeric crowns were milled and pretreated (n = 20) : visio. link (VL), Scotchbond Universal (SU), Monobond Plus/Heliobond (MH), Margin Bond (MB), Margin Bond mixed with acetone (1 : 1) (MBA) or not pretreated (CG). Half of the specimens were cemented using Variolink II and the other half with RelyX Ultimate. Specimens were stored for 24 h in distilled water and thermal cycled (5000 ×, 5 °C/ 55 °C). The <b>retention</b> <b>load</b> was measured and failure types were defined. RS was calculated and analyzed using both two- and one-way ANOVA with a post-hoc Scheffé-test, unpaired t-test, Kaplan–Meier with Breslow–Gehan test and chi-squared test (p < 0. 05). Crowns bonded using RelyX Ultimate showed higher RS than those bonded using Variolink II. The pretreatment showed no impact on the RS. However, survival analysis within Variolink II found an impact of pretreatment. The median RS for MH was the lowest and statistically different from MB, MBA and CG. For Variolink II MH had the poorest survival as the estimated cumulative failure function of the debonded crown increased very quickly with increasing TBS. Within the RelyX Ultimate groups, no significant differences were determined. The newly developed CAD/CAM polymer showed the highest bonding properties after cementation using RelyX Ultimate...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine and compare the <b>retention</b> <b>load</b> values (RL) of {{different}} telescopic crown assemblies (Y-TZP and CoCr primary crowns with electroformed and Y-TZP secondary crowns each) with three different taper angles (0 °, 1 ° and 2 °). Thirty Y-TZP primary crowns with electroformed gold copings (Z/G group) and Y-TZP secondary crowns (Z/Z group) and 30 CoCr primary crowns with electroformed gold copings (C/G group) and Y-TZP secondary crowns (C/Z group), each with taper angles of 0 °, 1 ° and 2 °, were fabricated, respectively. With {{the exception of the}} electroformed gold copings, all specimens were Computer-Aided-Design/Computer-Aided-Manufacturing (CAD/CAM) -milled, then sintered and afterwards manually adapted. In order to stabilize the gold copings, they were fixed in a tertiary structure. The secondary crowns were constructed with a hook, which ensured self-alignment with an upper chain. Afterwards, 20 pull-off test cycles were performed in a universal testing machine under artificial saliva and after weighing the secondary crowns with a 5 kg object for 20 s. Data were analyzed by one-way and two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). C/Z with 1 ° showed higher (p = 0. 009) RL than 0 ° and 2 ° tapers. C/G at 1 ° also showed higher (p = 0. 001) RL than at tapers of 0 ° and 2 °. Z/G and C/G at 0 ° showed lower RL than Z/Z and C/Z (p < 0. 001). Primary crowns had no impact on the 0 ° group. Z/G showed lower RL as compared to C/Z within the 1 ° group (p = 0. 007) and Z/Z in the 2 ° group (p = 0. 006). The primary crown material had no influence on RL.

40|$|Since {{combined}} nitrogen is a pollutant in streams, {{rivers and}} coastal areas, conditions that favour nitrogen removal were identified. The importance of stream depth {{as a predictor}} of a reach's capacity to remove nitrogen was tested in the South Nation watershed (3915 km 2), an agricultural watershed in eastern Ontario. Combined nitrogen (N) retention was estimated in 48 reaches across the watershed which varied in discharge (0. 0008 [...] 118 m 3 s- 1), length (350 m to 5. 2 km) and size from headwaters to the outflow of the South Nation River at the Ottawa River. Retention dynamics were also investigated within a few sites over the summer season. Retention efficiency (expressed as a percentage of inputs) varied widely for nitrate from almost complete removal within a reach to reaches acting as a net source. A narrower range in percent <b>retention</b> and <b>loading</b> was observed for total nitrogen (TN) among the sites suggesting that some forms of combined nitrogen are relatively inert.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the respiratory responses involved in the maintenance of eucapnea during acute airway obstruction in 12 patients with chronic obstructive disease (COPD) and 3 age-matched normal subjects. Acute airway obstruction was produced by application of external flow-resistive loads (2. 5 to 30 cm H 2 O/liter per s) throughout inspiration and expiration while subjects breathed 100 % O 2. Application of loads of increasing severity caused progressive increases in PCO 2 in the patients, but {{the magnitude of the}} increase in PCO 2 varied substantially between subjects. On a resistance of 10 cm H 2 O/liter per s, the highest load that could be tolerated by all COPD patients, the increase in PCO 2 ranged from 1 to 11 mm Hg, while none of the normal subjects retained CO 2. Based on the magnitude of the increase in PCO 2 the patients could be divided into two groups: seven subjects whose PCO 2 increased by {{less than or equal to}} 3 mm Hg (group I) and five subjects whose PCO 2 increased by greater than 6 mm Hg (group II). Base-line ventilation and the pattern of breathing were similar in the two groups. During loading group I subjects maintained or increased tidal volume while all group II patients decreased tidal volume (VT). The smaller tidal volume in group II subjects was mainly the result of their shorter inspiratory time as the changes in mean inspiratory flow were similar in the two groups. The magnitude of CO 2 <b>retention</b> during <b>loading</b> was inversely related to the magnitude of the change in VT (r = - 0. 91) and inspiratory time (Ti) (r = - 0. 87) but only weakly related to the change in ventilation (r = - 0. 53). The changes in PCO 2, VT, and Ti during loading correlated with the subjects' maximum static inspiratory pressure, which was significantly lower in group II as compared with group I patients. These results indicate that the tidal volume and respiratory timing responses to flow loads are impaired in some patients with COPD. This impairment, presumably due to poor inspiratory muscle function, appears to lead to CO 2 <b>retention</b> during <b>loaded</b> breathing...|$|R

This paper focuses on the relaxation behavior of newly developed BFRP tendon for prestressing applications. A series of relaxation tests on BFRP tendons with three different initial stresses of 0. 4 fu 0. 5 fu and 0. 6 fu (fu = tensile strength) were first conducted through a specially designed setup to eliminate the adverse impact of slippage at anchor zone. Theoretical value of relaxation rate based on an existing theory was calculated. An additional group of test was designed to clarify the effect of pretension on the relaxation behavior. The {{results show that the}} setup can effectively measure the relaxation loss of specimen, with monitoring the slippage at anchor zone simultaneously. Higher stress level can lead to larger relaxation loss. Theoretically calculated value of relaxation rate is consistent with the experimental results. The relaxation rates of BFRP tendon at 1000 h are 4. 2 %, 5. 3 % and 6. 4 % under 0. 4 fu, 0. 5 fu and 0. 6 fu, respectively. Pretension performs effective for the controlling of relaxation loss.

Goals were {{to gain a better}} understanding of the management potential for removing nitrogen in large river systems by increasing connectivity between nitrogen-rich main channel areas and backwater habitats. BACKGROUND: Nitrogen (N) runoff to receiving streams and rivers, particularly in the form of nitrate-nitrite (NO 3 NO 2 -N), has increased several-fold in recent decades (Justic et al. 1995, Vitousek et al. 1997, Goolsby and Battaglin 2001). A consequence of accelerated N mobilization and transport has been water quality degradation of coastal areas and estuaries which are sensitive to N inputs (Nixon 1995). For instance, increased N loading from the Mississippi River basin has been associated with the development of extensive areas of anoxia and hypoxi...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} {{of sewage}} sludge is highly complex and prone to inhibition, which can cause major issues for digester operators. The result is {{that there have been}} numerous investigations into changes in operational conditions, however to date all have focused on the qualitative sensitivities, neglecting the quantitative. This study therefore aimed to determine the quantitative sensitivities by using factorial design of experiments and small semi continuous reactors. Analysis showed total and volatile solids removals are chiefly influenced by retention time, with 79 % and 59 % of the observed results being attributed to retention time respectively, whereas biogas was mainly influenced by loading rate, 38 %, and temperature, 22 %. Notably the regression model fitted to the experimental data predicted full-scale performance {{with a high level of}} precision, indicating that small reactors are subject to the same sensitivity of full-scale digesters and thus can be used to predict changes <b>loading,</b> <b>retention</b> time, and temperature...|$|R
40|$|Anaerobic {{fixed bed}} reactor is a {{fermentation}} anaerobic reactor used microorganism attached growth system, where degradation of organic material done by microorganism that growth in support material as fixed film. This system mostly used for organic wastewater treatment now. The assessment is carried out for the Slaughterhouse wastewater treatmentwhere the support material for microorganism growth is a fabricated media. Plant is a demonstration scale by digester volume of 600 m. Wastewater is feeding to the digester by up flow system. The wastewater pumped {{from the bottom of}} the digester, flow through the support material, contact with the microorganism fixed on the media. Degradation of the organic waste process is take place along wastewater contact with the fixed film. Observation is on the performance of the reactor by the influence of organic loading to the pollution degradation of slaughterhouse wastewater called reactor efficiency. Fixed Bed Reactor performance still reached until 3 days hydraulic <b>retention</b> on organic <b>loading</b> rate about 3. 05 kg COD/m hr, and efficiency 75 %...|$|R
