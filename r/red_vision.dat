5|$|Son of God {{consists}} of a single series of three episodes. Each episode lasts approximately 50 minutes and documents a different stage of Jesus's life. The episodes take the format of Bowen visiting significant locations {{from the life of}} Jesus, talking head interviews with 21 historians and Biblical experts, and reenactments of Jesus's life featuring Israeli actor Liron Levo. Locations from Jesus's time—such as Caesarea, Yatta and Sepphoris—were recreated by archaeologists using evidence from buildings and street plans, and were then digitised into computer graphics by <b>Red</b> <b>Vision.</b>|$|E
500|$|Son of God took 16 {{months to}} produce, and cost {{approximately}} £1.5million. It was featured {{as part of}} a £253million season of new television programming on the BBC during the spring of 2001. British conductor James Whitbourn was commissioned to write a complete symphonic score for the series, which was performed by the BBC Philharmonic. The completed programme featured more than {{an hour and a half}} of Whitbourn's music. Whitbourn subsequently used the seminal themes from his orchestral score as the basis of his popular choral work, Son of God Mass, for soprano saxophone, choir and organ. Computer graphic images were created by design group <b>Red</b> <b>Vision,</b> who employed techniques similar to ones used in the 2000 BBC series Walking with Dinosaurs. Speaking in September 2001, a spokesman for <b>Red</b> <b>Vision</b> stated that their involvement in Son of God had been [...] "incredibly successful" [...] for them.|$|E

In the lead-up to episode one, several newspapers, including The Daily Mail and The Guardian, ran stories speculating whether the computer-generated image could show the true face of Jesus.

40|$|Background: People {{with color}} vision {{deficiencies}} report numerous limitations in daily life. However, they use basic color terms systematically {{and in a}} similar manner as people with people with normal color vision. We hypothesize that a possible explanation for this discrepancy between color perception and behavioral consequences might be found in the gaze behavior of people with color vision deficiency. Methods: A group of participants with color vision deficiencies and a control group performed several search tasks in a naturalistic setting on a lawn. Results: Search performance was similar in both groups in a color-unrelated search task as well as in a search for yellow targets. While searching for <b>red</b> targets, color <b>vision</b> deficient participants exhibited a strongly degraded performance. This was closely matched by the number of fixations on red objects shown by the two groups. Importantly, once they fixated a target, participants with color vision deficiencies exhibited only few identification errors. Conclusions: Participants with color vision deficiencies are not able to enhance their search for red targets on a (green) lawn by an efficient guiding mechanism. The data indicate that the impaired guiding is the main influence on search performance, while foveal identification (verification) largely unaffected...|$|R
