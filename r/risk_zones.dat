By September18, it had been upgraded to a tropical storm warning and extended southward to Minatitlán, although the initial watch area was placed under a hurricane watch after Gert showed signs of strengthening. The next day, the tropical storm watch from Soto La Marina to Nautla was upgraded to a hurricane warning as it became clearer where Gert would make landfall. Prior to impact, several ports along the Gulf Coast halted their operations, and people living in <b>risk</b> <b>zones</b> were evacuated.

The United States Department of Defense sent power equipment, previously {{used during the}} Great Flood of 1993, to Fort Bragg, while the United States Department of Agriculture stockpiled food in <b>risk</b> <b>zones.</b> Power companies deliberately shut off the power in the Outer Banks to reduce damage to the system and mitigate the risk of electrocutions. At Naval Station Norfolk, 28ships sailed out to sea to ride out the storm; aircraft were evacuated, and nonessential personnel were sent home. The North Carolina government announced ahead of the storm {{that it would not}} create a State Disaster Fund, instead relying on private relief organizations such as the American Red Cross and the Salvation Army. The state's park service pre-positioned 60members with chainsaws to help clear downed trees. Because Emily hit during the busy Labor Day weekend, the tourism industry suffered about $10million in business losses. Many of the evacuees relocated to southeastern Virginia, which saw greatly increased business during the weekend.|$|E
5|$|While moving little near Puerto Rico, Emily brought {{prolonged}} {{tropical storm}} conditions to {{many parts of}} the island. The heaviest rainfall occurred in southern regions; Caguas recorded a total of 8.22in (209mm) of rain during the storm. High winds damaged an electrical grid, cutting off power to about 18,500customers; roughly 6,000people were left without drinking water during the storm. Dozens of residents evacuated to shelters, in particular those living near <b>risk</b> <b>zones.</b> Torrential rains of up to 10inches (250mm) overflowed three rivers, which resulted in the flooding and subsequent closure of the PR-31 highway and PRI-3 intersection. Throughout the island, multiple other roads were made impassable by landslides and fallen objects; infrastructural damage surmounted $5million, according to preliminary estimates. The two-day suspension of about 280,000employeesabout 30percent of the territory's workforceaffected the local economy significantly, with capital losses estimated at $55million.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to Arlene's formation, {{the government of}} Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for coastal areas from Barra de Nautla northward to Bahia Algodones on June29. Later that day, a hurricane watch was put into effect for the area extending from Tuxpan to La Cruz, after the storm showed signs of strengthening. They were both extended shortly after, with the watch then reaching to Barra de Nautla and the warning further southward to Palma Sola, though the latter was simultaneously discontinued for areas {{to the north of}} La Pesca. Prior to landfall, the Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) activated a contingency plan for <b>risk</b> <b>zones</b> in the states of Veracruz and Tamaulipas.

Becker refers to Elizabeth Wilson's book Sphinx in the City and assumes that women overestimate the dangers of urban surroundings. The focus on opening public spaces and areas to women (at least in Europe) is counterproductive.

40|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography {{was used to}} image blood flow and metabolic tracers in <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> myocardium after left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion during synchronized coronary venous retroperfusion. Six control and seven intervention open chest dogs had occlusion of the mid left anterior descending coronary artery. Synchronized retroperfusion commenced 25 min later. Flow tracers (rubidium- 82 and nitrogen- 13 ammonia) were injected retrogradely. Three hours after coronary occlusion, fluorine- 18 (F- 18) deoxyglucose uptake in the control and treatment groups was compared. At 200 min of occlusion, infarct size was assessed. Retrograde flow tracer uptake was observed in the <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> in the seven intervention dogs. Fluorine- 18 deoxyglucose uptake in the <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> was increased {{in five of the}} six intervention dogs but was reduced in five of the six control dogs. The <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> to normal zone F- 18 deoxyglucose count ratio was higher in the interventionthan the control group (1. 13 ± 0. 39 vs. 0. 59 ± 0. 51; p < 0. 05). The endocardial subsegment <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> to normal zone F- 18 deoxyglucose count ratio was also significantly higher in the intervention group.

40|$|Objective: To {{diagnose}} {{the risk}} of developing caries in pregnancy as a parameter for providing oral health and defining individually preventive programs for pregnant women. Methods: The research was designed as a section study using methods of social medicine and epidemiology. 150 pregnant women were examined. 50 of the pregnant women were asked to answer a specially designed test for this research. The sources for data were: the caries risk diagnosis test as instrument of research and part of the original set of methodological forms for following oral health, and the Preventive Program for dental health care of the inhabitants of Serbia. The test contains general and specific parameters of risk with data of the course of pregnancy, diet and oral status. The tested women were classified in the zones of low, middle and high risk. Results: Of all the 50 tested pregnant women, 62 % of them were in the low <b>risk</b> <b>zone,</b> and 38 % in the middle <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> of caries <b>risk.</b> In pregnant women of the low <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> DMFT was determined as 14. 65; for pregnant women in the middle <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> the average was DMFT of 17. 05.

40|$|We {{propose the}} design and {{development}} of an energy-efficient Risk Notification Message Dissemination Protocol (RNMDP) for vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). RNMDP propagates Risk Notification Messages (RNMs) from their location of origin (called the <b>Risk</b> <b>Zone)</b> to vehicles approaching the <b>Risk</b> <b>Zone.</b> RNMDP assumes each node is aware of its current location in the network. The protocol works as follows: A RNM is broadcast {{in the neighborhood of}} the <b>Risk</b> <b>Zone.</b> A node receiving the RNM from another node waits for a Rebroadcast-Wait-Time before deciding to rebroadcast the message. The Rebroadcast-Wait-Time for a node is modeled based on the ratio of the distance between the node and the immediate sender of the RNM and the direction of movement of the node. Priority for rebroadcast is given for nodes farthest away from the sender and traveling towards the <b>Risk</b> <b>Zone.</b> Nodes that are traveling in lanes in direction away from the <b>Risk</b> <b>Zone</b> are also considered for rebroadcast, albeit with a larger Rebroadcast-Wait-Time. During the Rebroadcast-Wait-Time, if a node hears the same RNM again rebroadcast in the neighborhood, then the node stops from further broadcasting the message. If a node does not hear the RNM in its neighborhood during the RebroadcastWait-Time, the node broadcasts the message in its neighborhood. A RNM is considered to have been delivered to all the vehicles in the road, if the message reaches the Target Zone. The performance of RNMDP has been compared with that of the commonly used flooding strategy through extensive simulations conducted for highway networks with different number of lanes and lane density. Simulation results indicate that with a slightly larger delay (i. e., no more than 35 % of the delay incurred for flooding), RNMDP can achieve the same message delivery ratio attained by flooding, but at a relatively much lower energy loss compared to flooding.

40|$|One hundred nine dogs {{subjected}} to experienced experimental coronary occlusion were retrospectively examined {{in an attempt}} to identify factors influencing infarct size. A coronary artery was occluded by an embolus. The held of the occluded artery (<b>zone</b> at <b>risk)</b> was determined by subsequent autoradiography of 141 -cerium-labeled microspheres that were injected into the left ventricle 2 minutes after embolization. Fifty-eight dogs were analyzed after 24 hours of embolization and 51 after 48 hours. Infarct size (assessed by tetrazolium staining) was directly proportional {{to the size of the}} <b>zone</b> at <b>risk</b> in both groups. The percent of the <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> that developed infarction was independent of <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> size in both the 24 and 48 hour groups. No differences were seen between male and female animals or between the dogs with left circumflex or left anterior descending artery occlusion. Infarct size was also independent of the heart rate-systolic pressure product at the time of coronary occlusion, and of the time of year. Eighty percent of the variability in the portion of the <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> that infarcted in this population could be explained by the level of collateral flow in the <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> 2 minutes after embolization. The linear regression between the percent of the <b>risk</b> <b>zone</b> that developed infarction and collateral flow was the same in slope and intercept between the 24 and 48 hour groups. The correlation between infarct size and collateral flow was slightly better when collateral flow was expressed as a percent of flow in the nonischemic zone than when it was expressed in absolute terms. In conclusion, infarcts reach their ultimate size in the first 24 hours of ischemia and the size of the <b>zone</b> at <b>risk</b> and the level of blood flow through native collateral channels are the major determinants of infarct size after permanent occlusion of a coronary artery...|$|R
