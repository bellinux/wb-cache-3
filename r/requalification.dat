2500|$|The Navy Sharpshooter's Badge {{was made}} of antique bronze with a {{rectangular}} brooch that had the word [...] "SHARPSHOOTER" [...] embossed in its center with circling serpent bookends. [...] Below the brooch hung two types of clasps, an Expert Qualification Clasp and a Qualification Year Clasp. [...] From those clasps hung the badge's pendant. [...] The Expert Qualification Clasp is identical in design to the brooch but with the word(s) [...] "EXPERT," [...] for the service rifle, or [...] "EXPERT PISTOL SHOT," [...] for the service pistol. [...] Each time a shooter requalified as expert, another Expert Qualification Clasp was hung from the badge. [...] If no Expert Qualification Clasp was suspended from the badge, then the shooter qualified as a sharpshooter with the service rifle and/or service pistol. [...] The Qualification Year Clasp is different in design from the brooch which incorporated three ovals along its access for the placement of Year Disks. [...] The Year Disk {{was made of}} silver and embossed with the year the shooter qualified/requalified. [...] On the fourth <b>requalification</b> year, another Qualification Year Clasp was hung from the badge with a fourth Year Disk embossed with the year of <b>requalification.</b> [...] There was no limit {{to the number of}} clasps that could be hung from the badge. [...] Hanging from the clasp(s) was the badge's pendant, which was the design basis for today's U.S. Navy marksmanship medals. [...] The only difference between the pendant of the Navy Sharpshooter's Badge and the Navy Expert Rifleman Medal or Expert Pistol Shot Medal is the metal color (from antique bronze to gold), the deletion of the crossed rifles from behind a replica of a rifle target, and the addition of the words [...] "EXPERT RIFLEMAN" [...] or [...] "EXPERT PISTOL SHOT" [...] embossed above the rifle target.|$|E
