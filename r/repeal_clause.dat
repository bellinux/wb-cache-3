The report recommended that the bill be passed, and also suggested adding an [...] "automatic repeal clause" [...] to the Railway Appropriation and Finance Appropriation Acts, as these Acts were only required to be in effect {{for the duration of}} one year. The Committee suggested adding similar clauses in other pending Bills as well, and recommended that the Law Ministry consider amending Section 6A of the General Clauses Act, 1897(related to the effect of repeals) to enable the inclusion of an automatic <b>repeal</b> <b>clause</b> in Bills. The Committee further noted that a review and repeal of obsolete laws should be carried out every 5 years.|$|E
5000|$|The Catholic Relief Act 1793 implicitly {{amended the}} Newtown Act, {{permitting}} Catholics {{to vote and}} specifying a different electoral oath. Clauses (sections) 1-7 of the Newtown Act were repealed {{by an act of}} 1795 (35 George III c.29). The Acts of Union 1800 disenfranchised most Irish boroughs, and the corporations of many of these became defunct; clause 8 of the Newtown Act continued to apply to the remainder. In 1826, Sir John Newport tried unsuccessfully to introduced a bill to <b>repeal</b> <b>clause</b> 8. [...] The Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840 abolished most corporations and reformed the remainder. This rendered the Newtown Act obsolete. Section 8 was repealed by the Statute Law Revision (Ireland) Act 1878.

60|$|First, then: If {{that country}} was {{in need of}} a {{territorial}} organization, could it not have had it as well without as with a repeal? Iowa and Minnesota, to both of which the Missouri restriction applied, had, without its repeal, each in succession, territorial organizations. And even the year before, a bill for Nebraska itself was within an ace of passing without the <b>repealing</b> <b>clause,</b> and this {{in the hands of the}} same men who are now the champions of repeal. Why no necessity then for repeal? But still later, when this very bill was first brought in, it contained no repeal. But, say they, because the people had demanded, or rather commanded, the repeal, the repeal was to accompany the organization whenever that should occur.|$|R
50|$|This clause {{was first}} applied to {{fugitive}} slaves and required {{that they be}} extradited upon the claims of their masters.

France also obtained perpetual wood, hunting and water rights for the area as well as compensatory land for the castle, which it did not get. Once France, the United States and the United Kingdom had agreed, the Bundestag was able to <b>repeal</b> the <b>clause,</b> which it did effective in February 1986.

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} {{the level of}} independence and freedom {{of the mass media}} industry in Uganda. It explored the challenges that media professionals practically go through and face in the process of carrying out media work and practicing their professions in Uganda, and secondly, it identified how both the existing and newly proposed laws impact on the mass media freedom in Uganda while drawing from the domestic, national, regional and international laws. Qualitative methods were used in this research with interviews and content Analysis being central. The findings indicate that the mass media in Uganda is still not free as most respondents concurred with what is in the documented reports by HRW, Amnesty International, UHRC, IFEX, CPJ, and HRNJ about media censorship in Uganda. A critical analysis of the various media laws in Uganda revealed that they have not been aligned to regional and international standards. The study, recommends among other things that the government of Uganda should respect freedom of expression as laid down under the constitution, regional and international laws. Secondly, that the media laws in Uganda should be revisited, to meet the regional and international standard by way of <b>repealing</b> <b>clauses</b> that are hostile and unfriendly to free practice of mass media. A self-regulatory media system should be adopted as a way of ensuring less interference by the government in the regulatory process...|$|R

5000|$|From time to {{time there}} has been debate over <b>repealing</b> the <b>clause</b> that {{prevents}} Roman Catholics, or those who marry one, from ascending to the British throne. Proponents of repeal argue that the clause is a bigoted anachronism; Cardinal Winning, who was leader of the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland, called the act an [...] "insult" [...] to Catholics. Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor, {{the leader of the}} Roman Catholic Church in England, pointed out that Prince William (later the Duke of Cambridge) [...] "can marry by law a Hindu, a Buddhist, anyone, but not a Roman Catholic". Opponents of repeal, such as Enoch Powell and Adrian Hilton, believe that it would lead to the disestablishment of the Church of England as the state religion if a Roman Catholic were to come to the throne. They also note that the monarch must swear to defend the faith and {{be a member of the}} Anglican Communion, but that a Roman Catholic monarch would, like all Roman Catholics, owe allegiance to the Pope. This would, according to opponents of repeal, amount to a loss of sovereignty for the Anglican Church.|$|R
5000|$|In the United Kingdom, {{from time}} to time there had been debate over <b>repealing</b> the <b>clause</b> that {{prevents}} [...] "Papists" [...] (Roman Catholics) or those who marry one from ascending to the British throne. The Scottish Parliament unanimously passed a motion in 1999 calling for the complete removal of any discrimination linked to the monarchy and the repeal of the Act of Settlement. A private member's bill—the Succession to the Crown Bill—was introduced in the House of Lords in December 2004. The government, headed by Tony Blair, however, blocked all attempts to revise the succession laws, claiming it would raise too many constitutional issues and it was unnecessary at the time. The issue was raised again in January 2009, when a private member's bill to amend the Act of Succession was introduced in parliament. British Labour Member of Parliament Keith Vaz introduced to the House of Commons at Westminster, in early 2011, a private member's bill, which proposed that the Act of Settlement be amended to remove the provisions relating to Roman Catholicism and change primogeniture governing the line of succession to the British throne from male-preference to absolute.|$|R

Pub.L. 93-373 did not <b>repeal</b> the Gold <b>Clause</b> Resolution of 1933, which made unenforceable any contracts which specified payment in a fixed amount of money or a fixed amount of gold. That is, contracts remained unenforceable if they used gold monetarily rather than as a commodity of trade.

50|$|When the Lancaster & Carlisle Railway (L&CR) was {{approved}} in June 1844 {{there were a}} number of schemes for a railway over the Pennines. The York & Carlisle Railway proposed a route from the East Coast Main Line (ECML) at Northallerton via Richmond, Barnard Castle, the Tees Valley, Stainmore and the Eden Valley to the L&CR at Clifton. A rival scheme, the Yorkshire & Glasgow Union Railway, left the ECML at Thirsk, crossed the Pennines to Hawes, then Kirkby Stephen, Appleby and so reached Clifton. The Leeds and Carlisle left the Leeds Northern Railway near Headingley and passed through Wharfedale to Hawes and the Eden Valley. These schemes came together as the Northern Counties Union Railway, which was given authority in 1846 for a 69 mi line from Thirsk to Clifton and a 50+1/4 mi line from Bishop Auckland to Tebay. However, it would have cost £35,000 to pass through the estate of the Duke of Cleveland between Bishop Auckland and Barnard Castle, and it was a condition of the enabling Act that work on the two lines must be simultaneous. Attempts in 1847 and 1848 to <b>repeal</b> this <b>clause</b> failed and the company failed to raise the necessary finance to start work, its powers lapsed and was wound up.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1911 a new Prussian law on {{cremation}} was reported, which contained a provision that female corpses must be examined {{to determine if they}} were virgin. This caused outrage among the women of Berlin.Pappritz said the experts could not produce any valid reason for this violation of this most intimate and private aspect of a woman's life, {{at a time when the}} dead woman was helpless and had no way to defend her reputation. Pappritz organized an emergency IAF meeting to protest the law, which had a huge turnout and was followed by petitions. By early January 1912 the Prussian secretary of the interior had <b>repealed</b> the offending <b>clause,</b> but the effect of the scandal was to increase agitation for suffrage in the women's press.|$|R
500|$|What {{followed}} {{was a period}} of virtual control of the government by Lancaster, yet increasingly [...] particularly after the death of Warwick in 1315 [...] he found himself isolated.

Lancaster still had issues with the king, though—particularly with the conduct of the new favourite, Hugh Despenser the younger, and Hugh's father. In 1322, full rebellion broke out which ended with Lancaster’s defeat and execution at the Battle of Boroughbridge in March. At the parliament of May in the same year, the Ordinances were <b>repealed.</b> However, six <b>clauses</b> were retained that concerned such issues as household jurisdiction and appointment of sheriffs.

60|$|Now, sir, {{in answer}} to your question, whether if an attempt should be made here for {{repealing}} the Sacramental Test, it {{would be likely to}} succeed? The number of professed dissenters in this Parliament was, as I remember, something under a dozen, and I cannot call to mind above thirty others who were expected to fall in with them. This is certain, that the Presbyterian party having with great industry mustered up their forces, did endeavour one day upon occasion of a hint in my Lord Pembroke's speech, to introduce a debate about <b>repealing</b> the Test <b>clause,</b> when there appeared at least four to one odds against them; and the ablest of those who were reckoned the most staunch and thorough-paced Whigs upon all other occasions, fell off with an abhorrence at the first mention of this.|$|R
