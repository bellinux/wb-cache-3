50|$|Among {{his many}} inventions and works are the Wimperis {{accelerometer}} of 1909, the first accelerometer rugged enough for use measuring {{the performance of}} automobiles. He was directed to Elliott Brothers for manufacture, and this started a long relationship between Wimperis and the company. The same year they introduced a gyroscopic turn indicator, and followed this with an optical speedometer, rate of <b>roll</b> <b>indicator,</b> indicated airspeed calculator and his famed bombsights.|$|E
50|$|A {{clinometer}} or inclinometer is {{an instrument}} for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or depression of an object with respect to gravity. It {{is also known as}} a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & <b>roll</b> <b>indicator.</b> Clinometers measure both inclines (positive slopes, as seen by an observer looking upwards) and declines (negative slopes, as seen by an observer looking downward) using three different units of measure: degrees, percent, and topo (see Grade (slope)#Nomenclature for details). Astrolabes are inclinometers that were used for navigation and locating astronomical objects from ancient times to the Renaissance.|$|E
50|$|Lipscomb's {{department}} was {{not permitted to}} engage in development of navigation systems, but was permitted to engage in other aircraft avionics such as pitch, <b>roll,</b> and yaw <b>indicators.</b> Singleton proposed to provide a system that would provide highly accurate pitch, <b>roll,</b> and yaw <b>indicators.</b> The system would be a north seeking stable platform controlled by gyroscopes and accelerometers. Such a system would automatically provide velocities in the East-West and North-South direction. And later, by providing integrators for these two axes, one would then have a full fledged Inertial Navigation System.|$|R

The pen measures two stress <b>indicators,</b> <b>roll</b> and rock, and provides multimodal feedback {{to engage the}} user in an affective loop. Scenarios are explored that either support in reducing, or stimulate a specific behavior...|$|R
40|$|This report {{compares the}} {{development}} tools Ascet and Matlab {{with regard to}} their suitability as tools for model based development of signal processing software for embedded systems. We derive appropriate metrics of quality and perform an implementation of a signal processing algorithm called RAI, <b>Roll</b> Angle <b>Indicator,</b> in both tools. RAI is an algorithm that with an Extended Kalman Filter estimates the roll angle, that is how much a motorcycle is leaning. From the models implemented in Ascet and Matlab we then generate C-code for a embedded system. This code is then run on an embedded target containing a Infineon C 167 microprocessor. Information from the implementation and the performance of the generated C-code is then used to compare the two model based development tools...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs an {{incremental}} forming process of bulk metal, ring rolling provides a cost effective process route to manufacture seamless rings. Applications of ring rolling cover {{a wide range}} of products in aerospace, automotive and civil engineering industries. Under some process conditions, defects such as porosity can sometimes be found in hot rolled rings, which are manufactured from high alloyed steel ingots having macro segregations. For the reduction of the waste of material and improvement of product quality, {{a better understanding of the}} relations between segregation levels in the ingot, process parameters in the hot ring rolling and the occurrence of porosity is needed. In this research, a coupled thermo-mechanical multi-stage finite element model is used to simulate the hot ring rolling process including preform forging. The deformations, stresses and strains from the preforming steps are included as initial conditions for the rolling stage. Subroutines are implemented to represent the control algorithm for the motion of the <b>rolls.</b> A damage <b>indicator</b> is implemented in the material model. Simulations with different feed rate curves are carried out in order to see the influence on the occurrence of porosity. Hot ring rolling experiments in an industrial rolling mill are conducted to validate the numerical study. The results of simulation and experiment show good agreement...|$|R
40|$|As an {{incremental}} forming process of bulk metal, ring rolling provides a cost effective process route to manufacture seamless rings. In {{the production of}} hot rolled rings, defects such as porosity can sometimes be found in high alloyed steel, manufactured from ingots having macro-segregation. For {{the reduction of the}} waste of material and improvement of product quality, {{a better understanding of the}} relations between parameters in the hot ring rolling process and the occurrence of porosity is needed. In this study round bars were used to manufacture rings on an industrial ring rolling mill. Different ring growth rates were applied to investigate the influence on the occurrence of porosity in the final rings. The hot rolled rings were inspected by ultrasonic testing, of which the results were also validated by metallographic investigation. In addition to the experimental investigations, coupled thermo-mechanical multi-stage finite element (FE) analysis was performed with integrated adaptive motion control of the <b>rolls.</b> A damage <b>indicator</b> was implemented in a user-defined elasto-viscoplastic material model. The deformations, stresses as well as temperature history from preform forging were included as initial conditions for the rolling stage. Damage indication from the numerical model matches the experimental result in the considered process conditions. In spite of the suggestion of a more careful process when a low ring growth rate is used in hot ring rolling, experimental and numerical studies demonstrate that with a low ring growth rate there is an increased susceptibility to damage as compared to application of a high ring growth rate...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{increase}} in political and funding commitments to malaria control {{have resulted in}} rapid scale up of indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) as priority vector control interventions. Despite this increasing coverage and consequent substantial reductions of malaria burden, residual malaria transmission by outdoor-biting mosquitoes in particular, necessitates complimentary vector control strategies such as larval source management. More sensitive and scalable entomological surveillance tools are required to monitor the resultant lower transmission levels that persist {{across much of the}} tropics. The Urban Malaria Control Program (UMCP) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, implements a large-scale community-based (CB) larviciding programme with the aim of demonstrating operational feasibility of integrating larval control into routine municipal services, while utilizing community-owned resource personnel (CORPs) for its implementation. The goal {{of this study was to}} a better understanding of community participation in larval-stage vector surveillance and control, and to develop a practical, safe and affordable prototype for routine programmatic adult mosquito surveillance. Qualitative methods involving administering a set of unstructured interviews to CORPs were used to investigate their performance and demographic characteristics, their perceptions and reasons for participating in the UMCP. Ethnographic and historical resources were used to examine how ‘participation in’ and ‘responsibility for’ larval control is inter-articulated through scientific protocols, development practices, and the specific political history of Tanzania. Cross-sectional surveys were later used to assess the effectiveness of operational, community-based larval habitat surveillance systems within the UMCP by estimating the respective detection coverage and sensitivity levels by CORPs. Additionally, an intensive and extensive CB system for routine, longitudinal, programmatic surveillance of mosquitoes using the Ifakara Tent Trap (ITT) was developed and evaluated in comparison with quality assurance (QA) surveys using either ITT or human landing catches (HLC) and with malaria parasite prevalence from the cross-sectional surveys. Overall, CORPs’ individual detection coverage and sensitivity levels were poor, influenced by his/her unfamiliarity with the area, habitat type, fencing and inclusion within larviciding <b>roll</b> out. These <b>indicators</b> were particularly low among CORPs recruited through programme management staff, compared to those recruited by local government officials or health committees, and among staff living outside their areas of responsibility. The CORPs perceived their role to be professional rather than voluntary, with participation being a de facto form of employment. In spite of all challenges, the central coordination role played by the city council, coupled with catalytic donor funding and technical support from expert research partners, enabled institutionalization of strengthened management and planning and improved community mobilization. Capacity to exploit national and international funding systems was enhanced and a sustainable implementation program was ultimately established with funding from the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, overseen by the National Malaria Control Programme and implemented by the City and Municipal Councils. Management of this program is currently supported by a spatially extensive and temporally intensive community-based longitudinal adult mosquito vector surveillance system with predictive power for parasite infection risk...|$|R
