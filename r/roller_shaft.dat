40|$|This paper {{presents}} the failure analysis of carbon steel <b>roller</b> <b>shaft</b> of continuous pad steam machine used in textile industry. The fracture position was located at a stepped diameter. The failed component was the shaft made of carbon steel AISI 1040. Standard procedure for failure analysis was employed in this investigation. Visual examination, chemical analysis, hardness and tensile strength measurements, microstructural characterization, fractography analysis by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) {{were used for}} the failure analysis. Using this failure analysis approach, we pinpointed the root cause of failure and developed a means of solving this type of failure in the future. Firstly, the chemical composition of the shaft is done by an Optical Emission Spectroscopy (OES) method, the found chemical composition was matching with required standard value. Mechanical testing consists of two test i. e. tensile test and hardness test and it was found out that the strength and hardness of specimens were within the required capacity. For metallurgical analysis, the microstructure of the shaft was developed by using an optical microstructure. Equal distribution of ferrite perlite shows that heat treatment was performed well and carbon percentage in a material is satisfying the standard values. Thus, it proves that the material used was of good quality and indicates that failure is not due to material property. Further for the fractography, the fractured surface was examined by SEM. The cross-section was taken in a quarter segments and divided into four regions i. e. A, B, C, and D. Fractography morphology mainly showed that the failure of <b>roller</b> <b>shaft</b> was caused due to fatigue. To examine the stress distribution at the fractured surface the Finite Element Method (FEM) was also carried out. Based on the shaft size, a precise ANSYS model was developed. The result of FEM shows that stress concentration was significant at <b>roller</b> <b>shaft</b> step which could reduce the material reliability to some extent. Based on the failure analysis it could be concluded that due to stress concentration a micro crack is initiated along the weak interface and further it converted into the major fatigue failure. Fractography morphology of failed <b>roller</b> <b>shaft</b> also confirms the fatigue failure...|$|E

40|$|Continuous {{furnaces}} with roller hearth have wide {{application in}} the steel industry. Typically, furnaces with roller hearth belong to the class of medium-temperature heat treatment furnaces, but {{can be used to}} heat the billets for rolling. In this case, the furnaces belong to the class of high temperature heating furnaces, and their efficiency depends significantly on the reliability of the roller hearth furnace. In the high temperature heating furnaces are used three types of watercooled <b>shaft</b> <b>rollers,</b> namely rollers without insulation, rollers with insulating screens placed between the barrel and the <b>shaft,</b> and <b>rollers</b> with bulk insulation. The definition of the operating conditions of <b>rollers</b> with water-cooled <b>shaft</b> greatly facilitates the choice of their design parameters when designing. In this regard, at the design stage of the furnace with roller hearth, {{it is important to have}} information about the temperature distribution in the body of the rollers at various operating conditions. The article presents the research results of the temperature field of the hearth rollers of metallurgical heating furnaces. Modeling of stationary heat exchange between the oven atmosphere and a surface of rollers, and between the cooling water and shaft was executed by finite elements method. Temperature fields in the water-cooled <b>shaft</b> <b>rollers</b> of various designs are explored. The water-cooled <b>shaft</b> <b>rollers</b> without isolation, rollers with screen and rollers with bulk insulation, placed between the barrel and the water-cooled shaft were investigated. Determined the change of the thermo-physic parameters of the coolant, the temperature change of water when flowing in a pipe and shaft, as well as the desired pressure to supply water with a specified flow rate. Heat transfer coefficients between the cooling water and the shaft were determined directly during the solution based on the specified boundary conditions. Found that the greatest heat losses occur in the rollers without insulation. Insulation (screens or bulk insulation) between the shaft and the barrel of roller allows reducing the cooling water losses. A comparative analysis of research results allowed us to find that operating conditions of the furnace rolls with screen insulation are more favorable in terms of thermal conditions and losses, than those of rollers without the insulation and rollers with the bulk insulation...|$|R

5000|$|A {{single shaft}} runs below the rollers running {{the length of}} the conveyor. On the shaft are a series of spools, one spool for each roller. An elastic {{polyurethane}} o-ring belt runs from a spool on the powered <b>shaft</b> to each <b>roller.</b> When the <b>shaft</b> is powered, the o-ring belt acts as a chain between the spool and the roller making the roller rotate. The rotation of the rollers pushes the product along the conveyor. The shaft is usually driven by an electrical motor that is generally controlled by an electronic PLC (programmable logic controller). The PLC electronically controls how specific sections of the conveyor system interact with the products being conveyed.|$|R

40|$|In this paperï¼Œthe {{loosening}} {{and coming}} out of a <b>roller</b> <b>shaft</b> is considered when a ceramics sleeve is shrinking fitted to two steel shafts. Under smaller shrink fitting ratio, the coming out behavior during rotation can be realized by the FEM simulation where the rotation of the roller is replaced by the load shift in the circumferential direction on the fixed roller. However, under larger shrink fitting ratio the shaft does not come out although care should be taken for the risk of sleeve fracture due to the larger thermal expansion of steel shaft. The effects of geometries such as the contact length, shaft thickness and taped shaft on the coming out are discussed in order to design the contact portion of this system. The results indicate that the contact length is more effective than other parameters, such as friction coefficient and elastic modulus of the shaft...|$|E

According to the power parameters of a table, calculation was conducted, processing of the values was carried out and compared with values used for the calculations. It was determined that the deviation of data obtained as a result of modeling compared to the theoretical data is within acceptable limits at 1. 3 %.
