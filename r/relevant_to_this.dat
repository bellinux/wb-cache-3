In the novel, the date of Augustus's death corresponds {{to that of the}} death of Poe's brother. The first chapter features Pym's sloop named the Ariel, the name of a character once played by Poe's mother Eliza Poe, and also the name of Percy Bysshe Shelley's boat, on which he died, originally named Don Juan in honor of Lord Byron.|$|E

25|$|The growth speed <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{question}} can be independently measured by researching the bone structure. In 1998 Zhang determined that growth was fast, leading to fibrolamellar bone. Comparison with the bone structure of an alligator indicated that Confuciusornis {{had a high}} metabolism {{comparable to that of}} modern birds. The growth speed of Confuciusornis would have been similar to that of Beipiaosaurus. A study by Armand de Ricqlès in 2003 indicated that growth was essentially modern, Confuciusornis reaching its maximum size in at most twenty weeks, perhaps as few as thirteen. Basal birds would have limited their size, not by slowing growth but by limiting the period of growth. A 2013 study found medullary bone in a short tailed specimen, confirming that it was female.|$|E

25|$|Accelerator-based light-ion fusion is a {{technique}} using particle accelerators to achieve particle kinetic energies sufficient to induce light-ion fusion reactions. Accelerating light ions is relatively easy, and {{can be done in}} an efficient manner—requiring only a vacuum tube, a pair of electrodes, and a high-voltage transformer; fusion can be observed with as little as 10 kV between the electrodes. The key problem with accelerator-based fusion (and with cold targets in general) is that fusion cross sections are many orders of magnitude lower than Coulomb interaction cross sections. Therefore, the vast majority of ions expend their energy emitting bremsstrahlung radiation and the ionization of atoms of the target. Devices referred to as sealed-tube neutron generators are particularly <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> discussion. These small devices are miniature particle accelerators filled with deuterium and tritium gas in an arrangement that allows ions of those nuclei to be accelerated against hydride targets, also containing deuterium and tritium, where fusion takes place, releasing a flux of neutrons. Hundreds of neutron generators are produced annually for use in the petroleum industry where they are used in measurement equipment for locating and mapping oil reserves.|$|E

The missing DiCola tracks are the only tracks on the 1991 CD that are not present on the new CD which indicates an effort to use only Rocky Balboa composer Conti's tracks.|$|E

500|$|Good slotted {{lines are}} {{precision}} made instruments. [...] They {{need to be}} because mechanical defects can affect accuracy. [...] Some of the mechanical issues that are <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> include backlash of the vernier, concentricity of {{the inner and outer}} conductor, circularity of the outer conductor, centrality and straightness of the inner conductor, variations in cross-section, and the ability of the carriage to maintain a constant probe depth. [...] Issues with probe tuning and disturbances to the field have already been discussed, but the insulated spacers holding the centre conductor in place can also disturb the field. [...] Consequently, these are made as discrete as is compatible with mechanical strength. [...] However, the greatest source of inaccuracy is usually not the slotted line itself, but the characteristics of the detector diode.|$|E

500|$|TWA company manuals {{indicated}} that aborting a takeoff {{at high speeds}} is dangerous, and should only be attempted if an actual engine failure occurs before V1 speed. [...] "V1" [...] speed is the maximum speed at which the takeoff can be safely aborted; after V1 speed is exceeded, the plane must take off to avoid overrunning the runway. The captain of Flight 159 failed to announce that Flight 159 had achieved V1 speed, and the first officer believed the plane was at or near V1 (rather than having substantially exceeded V1) when he aborted the takeoff. [...] On a Boeing 707, the V1 speed is Flight 159 achieved a peak speed of [...] However, the NTSB determined that V1 was not <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> incident because it is only intended to advise pilots on whether they can abort after engine failure, and the first officer believed that his aircraft had been physically damaged and might not be capable of flight. As a result, the NTSB found the first officer's decision to abort was reasonable, but criticized the pilots for failing to execute the abort rapidly. [...] One NTSB board member, Francis H. McAdams, wrote in a separate minority report {{that he would have}} concluded that an abort was both reasonable and necessary under the circumstances, {{despite the fact that the}} aircraft had exceeded V1 and was certain to overrun the runway.|$|E
