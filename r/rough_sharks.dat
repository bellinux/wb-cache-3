50|$|<b>Rough</b> <b>sharks</b> {{are small}} to medium in size, ranging from 49 to 150 cm in adult body length, {{depending}} on species. Their bodies are compressed, {{giving them a}} triangular cross-section. They have two large dorsal fins, each with a sharp spine, and with the first fin placed far forward above the head. Even more so than their relatives, the dogfishes, they have rough and prickly skin. Unusually among sharks, they also possess a luminous organ.|$|E
50|$|At birth, {{they are}} less than 25 cm and they mature at about 50 cm. Most records are of {{individuals}} less than 1 m, but they can reach about 1.5 m. Their litter size is seven or eight pups off Angola to 23 in the Mediterranean. They have ridges over their eyes that expand into large, rounded knobs, which are covered with enlarged denticles - these are absent in other species of <b>rough</b> <b>sharks.</b> They possess very large spiracles that are vertically elongated, being almost {{as high as the}} length of their eyes. Their first dorsal spine is oriented slightly forward. They feed on worms, crustaceans, and mollusks.|$|E
50|$|This species {{grows to}} 64.5 cm long. It {{is similar to}} other <b>rough</b> <b>sharks</b> in having a stout, high trunk, a dorsally {{depressed}} head, and two sail-like dorsal fins with deeply embedded spines. The snout is short, with large nostrils whose lateral and medial apertures are separated by a thick nasal flap. The eyes and spiracles are oval in shape. The five pairs of gill slits are very small and vertical. The mouth is small, with thick, fleshy lips; the teeth in the upper jaw are narrow, erect, and smooth-edged, while those in the lower jaw are broad, blade-like, and smooth-edged. Only one row of teeth in the lower jaw are functional.|$|E

50|$|As Hayter maneuvered to attack, Frederick C. Davis {{was struck}} by a torpedo on her port side amidships, {{breaking}} her in two.

He felt that Rhino versus Jeff Jarrett was [...] "not much of a main event, but it followed the old rule of having the replacement babyface wrestler in a main event always win so fans don't feel ripped off." [...] As for the Iron Man match for the TNA X Division Championship between A.J. Styles and Christopher Daniels, Keller expressed {{that it was a}} [...] "very good match" [...] that had a [...] "nice change of pattern with just one fall during the match, but ultimately the first two-thirds wasn't particularly exciting or engrossing enough to top their previous Iron Man match." [...] He {{went on to say that}} Styles and Daniels [...] "were great in the final minutes at conveying sheer exhaustion mixed with desire to win" [...] and that they [...] "had a tough act to follow with the stunt filled Monsters Ball." [...] As for the Monster's Ball match, Keller said it was a [...] "good one" [...] but it was [...] "tough to go to four stars for a match that includes so many huge spots and little long-term selling, but it's also hard not to rate it this high when there's a potential [...] "big spot of the year" [...] and a crowd chanting [...] "That was awesome!" [...] afterward." [...] Meanwhile, Keller felt the World Tag Team Championship match was [...] "average" [...] and that it [...] "just didn't feel like a major PPV title match." [...] "Just a highspot fest with a lousy ending. The highspots were good, but it was far from a standout Ultimate X match. The [...] "can't miss" [...] match just missed based on not fulfilling high expectations," [...] is what Keller had to say regarding the Ultimate X match. As for Jushin Liger versus Samoa Joe, Keller believed it was an [...] "above average match of below average length," [...] but that it was [...] "disappointing they didn't go longer." ...|$|R
