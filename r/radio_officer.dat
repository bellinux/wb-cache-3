5|$|On 27 September 1916, UB-7 {{departed}} Varna {{for operations}} off Sevastopol {{and was never}} heard from again. According to some sources, UB-7 was mined somewhere in the Black Sea. In June 1917, a Russian pilot captured by the Germans reported that a Russian airplane bombed and sank UB-7 on 1 October at position , near the Chersones Lighthouse. Authors Dwight Messimer and Robert Grant are each dubious of this claim, {{and the fate of}} UB-7 is still officially unknown. Among the fifteen men lost on UB-7 were the Constantinople Flotilla's senior <b>radio</b> <b>officer,</b> and the first Bulgarian submariner lost during the war, a trainee from Vidin.|$|E
25|$|A huge wave {{swept the}} midships {{accommodation}} block, washing away the Chief Officer, Third Engineer, <b>Radio</b> <b>Officer</b> and his wife. The crew {{of a fire}} service helicopter threw a lifebelt to the Third Engineer, Arthur Carey, who managed to catch it and was rescued. The Chief Officer landed on the monkey island on top of London Valours bridge, and was later rescued by the harbour master's boat. The <b>Radio</b> <b>Officer</b> and his wife, Eric and Nan Hill, died in the heavy sea.|$|E
25|$|Three other {{survivors}} {{managed to}} board a small liferaft. One was the duty <b>radio</b> <b>officer</b> who had sent the distress message. The others were a badly wounded DEMS gunner, EG Elliot RN, and a passenger called Frank Brothers. After they had drifted for four days they sighted a submarine and used the reflective surface of a tobacco tin as a heliograph to attract her attention. The submarine, {{which may have been}} U-124, came and gave them fresh water. The next day the weather worsened, and in the afternoon the <b>radio</b> <b>officer</b> died.|$|E

25|$|During World War I, {{at least}} 504 men from County Wexford, who were {{enlisted in the}} British Army, died {{fighting}} in the land War.

25|$|The Afonso was {{outnumbered by}} the Indians, {{and was at}} a severe {{disadvantage}} since {{it was in a}} confined position that restricted its manoeuvring, and because its four 120mm guns could fire only two rounds a minute, as compared to the 60 rounds per minute of the guns aboard the Indian frigates. A few minutes into the exchange of fire, at 12:15, the Afonso took a direct hit in its control tower, injuring its weapons officer. At 12:25, an anti-personnel shrapnel bomb fired from an Indian vessel exploded directly over the ship, killing its <b>radio</b> <b>officer</b> and severely injuring its commander, Captain António da Cunha Aragão, after which the First Officer Pinto da Cruz took command of the vessel. The ship's propulsion system was also badly damaged in this attack.|$|E
25|$|Cavezzali {{cited the}} initial {{investigation}} as {{alleging that the}} officers were not always on the bridge and had not remarked on the falling atmospheric pressure. They had neither established the ship's position in relation to fixed points on the shore nor used the radar to monitor the ship's distance from the shore. More seriously, no-one aboard was monitoring the VHF radio and no-one took account of a weather report received from Malta. The initial investigation also alleged that no-one raised the alarm at 1400 hrs when the storm developed (This is contradicted by another source that states the Chief Officer raised the general alarm at 1330 hrs {{when he saw the}} ship was getting closer to the shore.) The initial investigation also alleged that the <b>radio</b> <b>officer</b> did not listen to the VHF radio at the scheduled times.|$|E
25|$|Although the Henze {{household}} {{was filled}} with talk of current affairs, Hans was also able to hear broadcasts of classical music (especially Mozart) and eventually his father realized that his son had a vocation as a musician. Henze began studies at the state music school of Braunschweig in 1942, where he studied piano, percussion, and theory. Franz Henze rejoined the army in 1943 and {{he was sent to}} the Eastern front, where he died. Henze had to break off his studies after being conscripted into the army in 1944, {{towards the end of the}} Second World War. He was trained as a <b>radio</b> <b>officer.</b> He was soon captured by the British and held in a prisoner-of-war camp for the remainder of the war. In 1945 he became an accompanist in the Bielefeld City Theatre, and continued his studies under Wolfgang Fortner at Heidelberg University in 1946.|$|E
50|$|During the 1950s and 1960s, {{there was}} a steady {{increase}} in traffic levels, and the telex-over-radio (TOR) system started operations.

25|$|Those aboard Collapsible B {{suffered}} greatly {{during the}} night. The boat gradually sank lower {{into the water}} as the air pocket underneath it leaked away. The sea began to get up towards dawn, causing the boat to rock in the swell and lose more of its precious air. Lightoller organised {{the men on the}} hull to stand in two parallel rows {{on either side of the}} centreline, facing the bow, and got them to sway in unison to counteract the rocking motion caused by the swell. They were directly exposed to the freezing seawater, first up to their feet, then to their ankles and finally to their knees as the boat subsided in the water. For some, the ordeal proved too much and one by one they collapsed, fell into the water and died. The victims possibly included John George Phillips, the first <b>radio</b> <b>officer,</b> and the third class passenger David Livshin, whose body was taken to the Carpathia on the following morning. About 30 people were left alive by the morning and were transferred into other lifeboats before being rescued by Carpathia.|$|E

500|$|The British steam {{freighter}} SS Manaar was sunk on 6 September 1939. U-38 {{opened fire}} on the freighter, intending to stop her, but she returned fire. This {{was the first time}} that a merchantman fired at a U-boat. Stunned by this unexpected response, U-38 dived and sank Manaar with torpedoes. Citing the fact that Manaar had fired at him, Liebe did not assist the survivors under the conclusion that the vessel was exempted from protection by the Submarine Protocol. [...] Berlin would release to the media the narrative that the Manaar had fired on U-38 on sight. [...] While Karl Dönitz did not believe that his submarines should have to maintain adherence to the Submarine Protocol in the face of armed merchantmen, due to the political situation, restrictions remained in force after this incident and he was merely able to issue instruction to all submarines to exercise caution. <b>Radio</b> <b>Officer</b> James Turner remained at his post until the last moment. As he was leaving he found two Lascars, one badly injured. Turner rescued both men while under continuous fire from U-38, for this he was awarded the Empire Gallantry Medal.|$|E
