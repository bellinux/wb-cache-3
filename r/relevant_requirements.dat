500|$|On June 6, 1979, {{two weeks}} after the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration {{suspended}} the type certificate for the DC-10, thereby grounding all DC-10s under its jurisdiction. It also enacted a special air regulation banning the DC-10 from U.S. airspace, which prevented foreign DC-10s not {{under the jurisdiction of the}} FAA from flying within the country. This was done while the FAA investigated whether or not the airplane's engine mounting and pylon design met <b>relevant</b> <b>requirements.</b> Once the FAA was satisfied that maintenance issues were primarily at fault and not the actual design of the aircraft, the type certificate was restored on July 13 and the special air regulation repealed.

40|$|Conventional grid-enabled portal designs {{have been}} largely {{influenced}} by the usual functional requirements such as security requirements, grid resource requirements and job management requirements. However, the pay-as-you-use service provisioning model of utility computing platforms mean that additional requirements {{must be considered in}} order to realize effective grid-enabled portals design for such platforms. This work investigates those <b>relevant</b> additional <b>requirements</b> that must be considered for the design of grid-enabled portals for utility computing contexts. Based on a thorough review of literature, we identified a number of those <b>relevant</b> additional <b>requirements,</b> and developed a grid-enabled portal prototype for the Grid-based Utility Infrastructure for SMME-enabling Technology (GUISET) initiative â€“ a utility computing platform. The GUISET portal was designed to cater for both the traditional grid requirements and some of the <b>relevant</b> additional <b>requirements</b> for utility computing contexts. The result of the evaluation of the GUISET portal prototype using a set of benchmark requirements (standards) revealed that it fulfilled the minimum requirements to be suitable for the utility context...|$|R
