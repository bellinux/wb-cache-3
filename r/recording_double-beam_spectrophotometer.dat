40|$|The normal {{spectral}} emittance of Inconel {{and type}} 321 stainless steel with different surface treatments was measured at temperatures of 900, 1, 200, 1, 500, and 1, 800 F over a wavelength range of 1. 5 to 15 microns. The measurements involved {{comparison of the}} radiant energy emitted by the heated specimen with that emitted by a comparison standard at the same temperature {{by means of a}} <b>recording</b> <b>double-beam</b> infrared <b>spectrophotometer.</b> The silicon carbide comparison standard had previously been calibrated against a laboratory black-body furnace. Surface treatments included electropolishing, sandblasting, electro-polishing followed by oxidation in air for 1 / 2 hour at 1, 800 F, sandblasting followed by oxidation in air for 1 / 2 hour at 1, 800 F, application of National Bureau of Standards coating A- 418, and application of NBS ceramic coating N- 143. The normal spectral emittance of both alloys in the electropolished condition was low and decreased very slightly with increasing wavelength while in the sandblasted condition it was somewhat higher and did not vary appreciably with wavelength. The oxidation treatment greatly increased the normal spectral emittance of both the electropolished and sandblasted type 321 stainless steel specimens and of the electropolished Inconel specimens and introduced some spectral selectivity into the curves. The oxidation increased the normal spectral emittance of the sandblasted Inconel specimens only moderately. Of the specimens to which a coating about 0. 002 inch thick was applied, those coated with A- 418 had higher emittance at all wavelengths than did those coated with N- 143, and the coated specimens of Inconel had higher spectral emittance at all wavelengths than did the corresponding specimens of type 321 stainless steel. Both coatings were found to be partially transparent to the emitted energy at this thickness but essentially opaque at a thickness of 0. 005 inch. Coated specimens with 0. 005 inch or more of coating did not show the effect of the underlying metal on spectral emittance, and {{there was no significant difference}} at wavelengths greater than about five microns in the normal spectral emittance of specimens having the two coatings.
