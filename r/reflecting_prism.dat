50|$|Gravity is {{measured}} using gravimeters. Basically, {{there are two}} kinds of gravimeters. Absolute gravimeters, which nowadays can also be used in the field, are based directly on measuring the acceleration of free fall (for example, of a <b>reflecting</b> <b>prism</b> in a vacuum tube). They are used for establishing the vertical geospatial control. Most common relative gravimeters are spring based. They are used in gravity surveys over large areas for establishing the figure of the geoid over these areas. Most accurate relative gravimeters are superconducting gravimeters, and these are sensitive to one thousandth of one billionth of Earth surface gravity.

40|$|Using a {{technique}} based on modulation of electromagnetic radiation polarization, we studied {{the features of}} surface plasmon resonance in gold nanofilms deposited {{onto the surface of}} a totally <b>reflecting</b> <b>prism</b> (fused quartz). The angular characteristics of the polarization difference of squares of the reflectance coefficient modules for s- and p-polarized radiation, ∆ρ =|Rs|² − |Rp|², were measured (at a wavelength λ = 0. 63 µm) for metal films whose thickness varied from 0 up to 120 nm. Contrary to the results given by the traditional techniques, the characteristics of ∆ρ peak under the resonance condition. As a result, two nonresonance components were found in these characteristics. The values and shapes of their angular dependences are determined by the coefficients of internal reflection from the metal and insulator that depend on the film thickness. Application of a model with exponential dependence of the refraction and extinction coefficients on the metal film thickness led to agreement between the results of calculation from the Fresnel formulas and those obtained experimentally. It was found that characteristic parameter of the exponential corresponds to the metal film thickness value of 11 ± 0. 5 nm...|$|E

40|$|Connection {{of small}} vessels is usually done by suturing {{which is very}} cumbersome. Laser tissue {{soldering}} can circumvent that obstacle if a handy procedure can be defined. Our principle approach consists of a bioresorbable hollow stent with an expected degradation time of 3 weeks in combination with laser soldering. The stent is to be fed into the vessel to stabilize both ends and should allow percolation immediately after joining. The stents are made of Poly(D,L-lactid-co-glycolid) and solder is prepared from bovine serum albumin (BSA) doped with Indocyanine green (ICG) as chromophore to increase the absorption of laser light. After insertion, solder is applied onto the outer surface of the vessel and coagulated by laser radiation. The wavelength of 810 nm of a diode laser fits favorably to absorption properties of tissue and solder such that heating up of tissue is limited to prevent from necrosis and wound healing complications. In our study the preparation of stents, the consistency and doping of solder, a beam delivery instrument and the irradiation conditions are worked out. In-vitro tests are carried out on sperm ducts of Sprague-Dowlae (SD) rats. Different irradiation conditions are investigated and a micro-optical system consisting of a lens and a <b>reflecting</b> <b>prism</b> to ensure simultaneous irradiation of front and {{back side of the}} vessels tested.

40|$|Abstract. As {{a kind of}} {{advanced}} automatic high precision three dimension data acquisition technology, three dimensional laser range scanning is used widely in high precision modeling and reconstruction for reverse engineering. It is also titled as realistic copy technology because of its well displaying of real object. After scanning a complicate real environment in detail with large volume of points, the technology can then reconstruct an object with point cloud in computer despite of large-size, complication and irregularity of the real landscape. However, the precision of the object modeling {{may be influenced by}} the error of the data from three dimension range scanner, which will result in the bias of analysis based on such model. So it is important to calibrate the instrument based on {{a better understanding of the}} error influence. As the objective of this paper, some calibrate schemes is designed in order to analyze the error source from the laser range scanner. The work principle and operation flow of three dimension laser scanner is reviewed firstly in this paper as the basis of further work in this paper. The accuracy of the instrument is evaluated with respect to distance measurement, angle measurement, temperature, intensity of echo, time, echo mode and so on. During the procedure of experiment, LR 1 -R from company of 3 D LaserMaping is used as the three dimension laser range scanner, Kern Mekometer is used as precision electronic apomecometer, Kern prism is used as <b>reflecting</b> <b>prism</b> and TCA 2003 is used as the total station...|$|E
40|$|Architectural {{surveying}} has {{for many}} years been approached in a manner which was so amateur that it left many people wondering whether {{it really was a}} separate discipline. Nowadays, the researcher's operational and algorithmic mentis form rejects this conception and suggests working on the methods, techniques and sequences of operations which are feasible and led to results; it also suggests recording every minute of this work, to describe it down to the minutest detail and be completely open about the errors committed and the choice criteria. The research presented here concerns a small piece of the mosaic which could be called «New Operative Methods for Architectural Surveying ». It is a programme involving. several Italian universities and concerns a method which simplifies and makes planimetric surveys quicker and more reliable. The method simplifies surveying, because the procedures 'can be carried out even by a single operator and makes it quicker because the field tests have shown a considerable reduction in the working times and finally it is more reliable because the procedure allows checking for any errors made during measurement. The method is based, in short, on the use of a theodolite equipped with an infra-red ray diastimeter which can operate even without a <b>reflecting</b> <b>prism,</b> i. e., by exploiting its own reflection on the surface under study. The diastimeter is accompanied by a laser which, thanks to a simple system of mirrors, produces a ray which is coaxial to the viewpoint of the diastimeter and allows sighting which does not require collimation via the spyglass. It is evident that while allowing a rather rapid surveying for polar coordinates, this method can free the surveyor from the tiring operations of trilateration and interacting with a computer and allows an almost immediate or even on-line results, i. e., at the very moment of measurement, attaining a sort of tracing of the building. To check both the quantity and quality errors made by the instrument, in our case, a WILD DIOR 3002 DISTOMAT, a simple and effective measuring instrument was prepared in the basement of Pescara University's Faculty of  Architecture. The instrument's performance was checked on various materials as were the different situations of the incidence of the ray of the surface being studied. The results obtained showed that the error is very constant and can therefore be checked by using a suitable procedure which consists in calibrating the instrument in the field. Three procedures were then experimented for collecting measurements and linking the models: the first, or «central» consisted in placing the instrument in a first position from which one could correspond all the other positions, measuring their three-dimensional coordinates vis-a-vis a reference system which originates from the first position. The second, or «tracking», is nothing more than the typical polygonal procedure. The third, or «support points» is that which furnished the best results, in terms of both precision and feasibility. In conclusion, research on surveying procedures is still an open field and there is much to discover as regards both the philological aspect and also the use of new technologies. When these studies are completed, architectural surveying, as regards both its practice and teaching, will be seen in a completely different light. The method will be appreciated to the same extent that the graphic quality of a plan is today, the traditional 'plan' will find itself in a context which no longer comprises tables, but various information and coordinates, which are however nonetheless aimed at satisfying the common objective of any scholar of architecture: knowledge...|$|E

It has a powerful armament of 8 torpedo tubes. A submarine has two sets of engines. Oil engines propel it on the surface and run dynamoes which generate electricity for large storage batteries. Electric engines propel the boat under water. It is submerged by letting the ocean water flow into tanks and rises to the surface by emptying the tanks by forcing in compressed air. The submarine, when submerged runs along under the surface, of the water at a depth of from a few feet to 100 or even more. If it runs too close to the surface it may be easily detected by an aeroplane.
