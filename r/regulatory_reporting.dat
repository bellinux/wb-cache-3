It also suggested that a study be undertaken of the potential merits of a comprehensive market-value-based reporting system for banks.As fair value was increasingly viewed as an important tool for valuation, a clear guidance was needed for better application.

50|$|Delisting {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of moving in the stock of a company from a stock exchange so that investors can no longer trade shares of the stock on that exchange.

40|$|Whereas {{a growing}} body of {{research}} has examined the consumer-related implications of deceptive advertising, the stock market consequences stemming from the regulatory exposure of such infractions remain largely unexplored. In a step to address this gap, the current research examines the effect of <b>regulatory</b> <b>reports</b> of misleading ads on firm stock prices. Results from an event study, focusing on the pharmaceutical industry as the empirical context, show an average abnormal return of - 0. 91 % associated with <b>regulatory</b> <b>reports</b> of deceptive advertising. Analysis of the abnormal returns, however, reveals that the stock market response to these reports is shaped by omission bias, in that investors penalize commission violations more than omission violations. Furthermore, firm reputation is found to moderate the penalty for commission violations. In addition, two experiments examine the effect of such violations on investor beliefs. The first helps elucidate the process mechanism underlying the observed stock market effects and the second provides insights regarding the reputation-omission bias interaction for firms committing repeat violations. Overall, our findings provide important theoretical, managerial, and public policy implications regarding the role of financial markets in regulating deceptive ad practices. deceptive advertising, omission bias, firm reputation, event study, experiment, pharmaceutical industry...|$|R
