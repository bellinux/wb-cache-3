50|$|Research {{on social}} loafing began with <b>rope</b> <b>pulling</b> {{experiments}} by Ringelmann, {{who found that}} {{members of a group}} tended to exert less effort in pulling a rope than did individuals alone. In more recent research, studies involving modern technology, such as online and distributed groups, have also shown clear evidence of social loafing. Many of the causes of social loafing stem from an individual feeling that his or her effort will not matter to the group.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1849 {{the first}} goods trains {{ran through the}} tunnel. Rail wagons were pulled by {{locomotive}} from Waterloo Dock down a gradient to the Byrom Street cutting. From the cutting the tunnel rose to Edge Hill. Rail wagons were pulled up the steep gradient from the Byrom Street cutting by a wire rope. The rope was the largest iron wire rope ever manufactured. A brick building housed a large static steam engine that wound the <b>rope</b> <b>pulling</b> the rail wagons up the tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Ratha or Rath means a chariot or car {{made from}} wood with wheels. The Ratha may be driven {{manually}} by <b>rope,</b> <b>pulled</b> by horses or elephants.

2500|$|Multiple written {{accounts}} from Arabic, Byzantine, and Western medieval sources describe a palace domed structure over {{the throne of}} Chosroes decorated in blue and gold. The dome was covered with depictions of the sun, moon, stars, planets, the zodiac, astrapai, and kings, including Chosroes himself. According to Ado and others, the dome could produce rain, and could be rotated with a sound like thunder by means of <b>ropes</b> <b>pulled</b> by horses in a basement.|$|R
50|$|The {{second half}} of the {{programme}} looks at Cloves. We are introduced to the pink flower buds on the tall trees and are told that the best cloves are pink and not yet opened. A mixture of long poles, <b>rope</b> <b>pulling</b> and tree climbing are used so the pickers can collect the clusters of buds from all over the trees. Back on the ground the individual cloves are snapped off from the bud cluster and they are sun dried in the streets. The rest of the bud cluster (stalks and a few small young leaves) are used as an additive to Tobacco, and we see Kate attempting, after much effort, to make a Herbal cigarette.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} {{activity is}} {{the singing of}} traditional poems. These include pantun, ramban, jawang, sanggai and pelandai. Honoured guests {{may be asked to}} break up a coconut to symbolise the actions of Sengalang Burong (the god of war) during the Iban timang incantation which is called [...] "ngelanpang" [...] (chopping off the head skull to present various kinds of beneficial seeds to humankind). Other activities include (blowpipe) sumpit contests, mini sports and traditional games such as tuak drinking, arm-wrestling (bibat lengan), small log pulling (betarit lampong), <b>rope</b> <b>pulling</b> (tarit tali) and foot-banging (bapatis). Some engage in cockfighting. Mini sports include football, sepak takraw (rattan kickball) and futsal. Other games are egg-rolling, plate passing according to the taboh music, running in gunny sacks and balloon blowing and karaoke and joget dance.|$|E
50|$|Andlu, {{also written}} as Aandlu or Andloo, {{is a small}} to {{medium-sized}} village in the Punjab state of India. It {{has a population of}} approximately 2500 and is located in the Raikot tehsil of district Ludhiana. The nearest major city is Ludhiana which is at approximately 38 kilometers from Andlu. Andlu is well connected to Raikot, Ludhiana and Ahmedgarh by well laid network of roads. It has two schools; the primary school for children up to fifth grade and a Higher Secondary School for students up to Grade twelfth. It also has a health dispensary run by the Department of Health of Punjab, and has a MBBS doctor appointed to the dispensary.

Popular games are football, cricket, <b>Rope</b> <b>pulling,</b> volleyball and cart racing.|$|E
50|$|In {{a related}} experiment, groups of chimps were given rope-pulling {{problems}} {{they could not}} solve individually. Warneken’s subjects rapidly figured out which individual in the group was the best <b>rope</b> <b>puller</b> and assigned it {{the bulk of the}} task. This research is highly indicative of the ability of chimps to detect the folk psychological state of “desire”, as well as the ability to recognize that other individuals are better at certain tasks than they are.|$|R
50|$|Yobuko has {{a festival}} known as Yobuko Ouzunabi (呼子大綱引), or the Yobuko big <b>rope</b> <b>pull,</b> {{which takes place}} {{annually}} on the first Saturday and Sunday of June.

60|$|The {{crew of the}} merchantman, who had not {{had time}} to {{comprehend}} what the young fellow was about to do, would have grasped him had he remained on the rail a moment longer, {{but now he was}} gone into the sea, and, working vigorously with his legs and arms, was endeavouring to keep his head above water while the pirates {{at the other end of}} the <b>rope</b> <b>pulled</b> him swiftly towards their vessel.|$|R
50|$|A torque {{amplifier}} is essentially two capstans connected together. A capstan {{consists of a}} drum that is connected to a powerful rotary source, typically the steam engine of the ship, or an electric motor in modern examples. To use the device, a rope is wound around the drum, with one end attached to a load, and the other hand-held by the user. Initially the rope has little tension and slips easily as the drum turns. However, if the user pulls on their end of the rope, the tension increases, gripping the drum. Now the entire torque of the driver {{is applied to the}} other end of the <b>rope,</b> <b>pulling</b> the load. If the user does nothing, the capstan will pull the load toward them, loosening the rope and stopping further motion. If the user instead takes up the slack, the tension is maintained and the load continues to be pulled. In this way, the user can easily control the motion of a very large load.|$|E
5000|$|String-pulling {{behavior}} has been likewise studied in seven Asian elephants by presenting {{them with a}} retractable (bungee) cord. In this setup, the cord is tied to a heavy log a few meters away from the elephant. A sugarcane (a favorite elephant treat) {{is attached to the}} cord, and can only be retrieved by repeated, coordinated, action of the trunk and another body part. The results were clearcut:"All seven logging elephants fully mastered the string-drawing sequence within 1-3 experimental sessions. In all cases of retractable <b>rope</b> <b>pulling,</b> the sequence involved pulling by the trunk, and then securing the rope by either foot or mouth. After 2-6 coordinated pulls, while still holding the rope with either mouth or foot, the elephants disengaged the sugarcane from the rope while still using mouth or forefoot as an anchor, and then consumed the sugarcane. All elephants seemed to be flexible about the use of anchor, interchangeably using mouth, foreleg, or both." ...|$|E
5000|$|A little later, Daffy is admiring {{himself in}} a mirror. Elmer puts on a semi-realistic female duck {{disguise}} and calls to Daffy from a pond. Daffy begins flirting with the duck, but dives underwater, sees Elmer's boots, and sees through his game. Still, Daffy plays along, and offers to bring some art collectibles for [...] "her" [...] to see. He slips away and awakens the fox (who was still unconscious until now) with a duck call. The fox sees the [...] "female duck", grabs it, and runs away, until he notices the neck stretching. Curiously, he confusedly asks [...] "What kind of a duck is this?" [...] as he opens {{the lid of the}} duck costume, and Elmer pops out pointing his gun in the fox's face. Elmer, still in costume, chases after the fox, but is caught by the boot with a long <b>rope,</b> <b>pulling</b> him out of the costume and getting him entirely stuck in the boot, sadly asking himself, [...] "How am I ever gonna catch that scwewy duck?" [...] Daffy, who lassoed him, replies, [...] "Precisely what I was wondering, my little nimrod!" ...|$|E
