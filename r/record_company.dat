5|$|The lack of <b>record</b> <b>company</b> support {{frustrated}} {{the band}} and led the band to self-produce their next album, The Beacon Street Collection, in a home-made studio, causing them {{to move away from}} the slick pop sound desired by Interscope and towards a more punk style. Their independence shocked their <b>record</b> <b>company</b> representative Tony Ferguson and the album sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, the year of its release, over three times as many as No Doubt sold. To capitalize on this success, Interscope offered the band extensive help with their third album, Tragic Kingdom, under the division Trauma Records to which the band was signed.|$|E

40|$|Problem: <b>Record</b> <b>companies</b> {{are facing}} a {{downturn}} in sales of music. This is seen as consequence {{of the growth of}} distribution of music through Internet by file sharing networks such as BitTorrent networks. On one side there are <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> who feel threatened of the illegal file sharing, {{and on the other side}} file sharing BitTorrent networks has increased dramatically in number of users since they first approached. Some <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> have responded by taking hostile actions towards the BitTorrent networks and their users with lawsuits and penalties for illegal file sharing. Other <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> and artists have joined forces with BitTorrent networks and see them as an advantage. Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore and analyze if, and how <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> can collaborate with the BitTorrent networks. Method: A hermeneutic inductive approach is used, in combination with qualitative interviews with both <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> and BitTorrent networks. Conclusions: It is argued that <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> can find a way in communicating and cooperating with BitTorrent networks. Instead of adopting hostile approaches and trying to restrict the technologies adopted by end users, companies should open themselves up and accept the current changes initiated and developed by BitTorrent networks. Thus, it was concluded that companies have to concentrate around collaborating with BitTorrent networks rather than fiercely protecting old business models. By opening up to the users, <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> will adopt open innovations approach that is characterized by combining external and internal ideas, as well internal and external paths to market, thus obtaining future technological developments. As for the BitTorrent networks, by going from outlaw to crowdsourcing mode, the networks’ creative solutions can be further harnessed by <b>record</b> <b>companies.</b> Finally, strengthening relationships between customers and music artists can be considered as beneficial for both <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> and BitTorrent networks. Thus, giving opportunities for customers to win special items, tickets for concerts, watch sound check, eat dinner backstage with the group, take pictures, get autographs, watch the show from the side of the stage, etc. can lead to valuable relationship in a long run...|$|R

5|$|By May, Harrison {{had agreed}} {{distribution}} terms with A Records {{and was therefore}} able to formally launch Dark Horse Records, although he would remain contracted to Apple as a solo artist, like the other Beatles, until January 1976. After announcing the staging of the Music Festival from India in September 1974, Harrison also confirmed {{that he planned to}} tour North America, together with Ravi Shankar's ensemble, during November and December. Despite his stated aversion to performing live, Harrison would be the first of his former bandmates to undertake a tour of Beatle-hungry America; the expectations that this created, together with his role as a hands-on <b>record</b> <b>company</b> boss, meant that the pressure on Harrison was immense.|$|E

40|$|Purpose/Aim: The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to define and analyse how Swedish <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> work with digital musical content {{distributors}}. A more narrow aim is {{to show how the}} <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> and with the digital musical content distributors iTunes Music Store and Spotify create incentives for consumer’s to use legal digital music channels through the Internet. To further circle the core of the problem following questions have been asked: How does the <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> provide iTunes Music Store and Spotify with digital content and what is done by the <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> to retain control over the material? How do the <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> view digital musical sales and what incentives are given to consumers to buy music digitally? Finally, What position of power do iTunes Music Store and Spotify have on the digital content arena? Material/Method: The data collected for this thesis is retrieved through personal interviews with representatives from three of the four major <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> Universal Music, Warner Music and EMI and their Swedish branches. Main results: The consumer’s access to digital content through iTunes Music Store and Spotify is of the utmost importance and is a prerequisite. Even if the <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> choose to not demand DRM protection on their products it does not stop Apple from keeping their Fairplay protection. In this way Apple is the company controlling the files, even if the <b>Record</b> <b>Companies</b> have made their decision based on research, which has shown that sales go down if the music files are DRM protected. The <b>record</b> <b>companies</b> have chosen not to get involved with the sales of digital content. This results in power being shifted to E-tailers such as iTunes Music Store and Spotify. The incentives the consumers are given to buy music digitally are found in the surplus value, which is supported by iTunes Music Store and Spotify. These surplus values are such services as recommendations of music or artists. Different packaging solutions, such as subscriptions through an Internet provider, do not raise the value of the music. The value is added to the Internet provider’s products and not the music, but they do guarantee a steady income for the <b>record</b> <b>companies...</b>|$|R

5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet newsgroup, inviting fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The veracity of the message was demonstrated when white lights {{in front of the}} stage at a performance in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma did exist, and that it had been instigated by the <b>record</b> <b>company</b> rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E

After the contract signing, EMI forwarded her a sizeable advance which she used to enroll in interpretive dance classes taught by Lindsay Kemp, a former teacher of David Bowie, and mime training with Adam Darius.|$|E

This line-up produced the album The Quiet Zone/The Pleasure Dome (September 1977). The band also shortened its name to Van der Graaf. Charles Dickie then joined the band on cello, documented on the live double-album Vital, which saw a brief reunion with Jackson. By the time Vital was released, in July 1978, the band had already split, because of lack of <b>record</b> <b>company</b> support in the United States and financial difficulties.|$|E
