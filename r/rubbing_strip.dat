5000|$|Autocar´s Edward Eves {{conducted}} a long-term {{test of the}} turbodiesel in 1981. The test concluded that the [...] "604D Turbo is a fine, friendly type of car which really begs to be used. This {{can be seen in}} the way the mileage is being built up with it at the rate of 24,000 miles in the year". The overall fuel consumption was estimated at 32.5 miles per gallon (8.7 liters/100 km). The author noted that while the car was not intended as a high-performance vehicle, [...] "it is a very practical vehicle for experienced drivers and is capable of very high point-to-point averages once the technique of driving on the torque curve is mastered". It was also described as [...] "an effortless long-distance car and should be considered by anyone whose motoring is of the order of 30,000 miles a year because this is one of the longest-legged of cars...that I have met". Regarding the diesel engine start-up procedure, the author described it as [...] "remarkably like firing up a petrol engined model". Accommodation inside the car was viewed as being [...] "fully up to international standards for a four-five seater touring saloon with room in the rear seat for two people to travel long-distances in real comfort". The velour seats were praised for their comfort but were viewed as being vulnerable to burns and soiling. Autocar noted that the map pockets in the doors were insufficiently deep and during the test the speedometer cable failed and the foil insert from the <b>rubbing</b> <b>strip</b> on a door detached.|$|E

50|$|September 2004 {{marked the}} third major Twingo revision. The Renault logo was fitted to the boot-lid, side <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips</b> were added {{and a new}} range of {{exterior}} colours launched.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, special Vega Nomad wagons were {{assembled}} {{with unique}} side window trim and filler panels (to make the 'b' pillars appear forward-slanted), tailgate <b>rub</b> <b>strips,</b> vinyl Nomad script identification.|$|R
50|$|The final {{revisions}} came in 1997, {{just over}} a year later, and all cars got slightly lowered suspension (~10 mm) and body coloured sills, <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips,</b> door handles and door mirror covers.|$|R
5000|$|Rossignol (Australia, 1993): Named for Skis Rossignol, {{this was}} a three-door V8i painted in Caprice blue-green {{metallic}} and fitted with a ski rack. It was also fitted with <b>rub</b> <b>strips,</b> wheel arch protectors, and other items that were optional on the base models.|$|R
50|$|September 1967 saw {{a slight}} {{facelift}} and general upgrade across the range. All KAD models received discreet <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips</b> on their flanks below {{the doors and}} identification of the modified cars was facilitated by the rearranging of the name badges on the front wing panels.|$|R
5000|$|Like {{its more}} {{expensive}} brethren, the Kapitän was reworked in late 1967 and received <b>rub</b> <b>strips,</b> a new ZF steering and a collapsible steering column. At the same time, a new HL (Hochleistung = high-performance) {{version of the}} 2.8 l-six became available that put out [...]|$|R
50|$|Side {{turn signal}} {{repeater}} lenses that were introduced on the USA 1992-1994 Legacy {{were replaced by}} a plastic cap that covers a hole where the side repeater is utilized internationally, {{and the color of}} the cap matches the color of the door <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> on vehicles sold in North America.|$|R
25|$|All four {{versions}} of the Hornet were mostly carryovers in 1974, with minimal trim changes. The car's front bumper lost its full-width vinyl <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> but gained two rubber-faced bumper guards. A larger rear bumper was added to meet new 5mph legislation, and the license plate was moved up to a position between the taillights.|$|R
5000|$|A styling {{appearance}} was adopted {{from the very}} popular 1963 Buick Riviera where the beltline arched up over the rear wheels, a modifiction of an older styling element called the [...] "Sweepspear", with later vehicles installing a <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> along the entire side of the vehicle tapering down as it reached the rear bumper.|$|R

50|$|In September 1967 the Diplomat (along {{with its}} less {{expensive}} siblings) received a work-over consisting of <b>rub</b> <b>strips</b> on its flanks, new recirculating ball steering by ZF and heated rear window. At {{the same time}} a HL (Hochleistung or high performance) version of the 2.8-liter six became available (140 PS/138 hp) for the Kapitän and Admiral models.|$|R
2500|$|In November 1981 {{the updated}} [...] "Alfetta '82" [...] range was launched, {{comprising}} 1.6, 1.8, 2.0 and 2.0 Turbo Diesel models. All variants adopted the bodyshell and {{interior of the}} 2.0-litre models; standard equipment became richer. All Alfettas had black plastic <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips,</b> side sill mouldings, tail light surround and hubcaps; the 2000 sported a satin silver grille and a simulated mahogany steering wheel rim.|$|R
50|$|In time, the Sweepspear became {{stainless}} steel, then a vinyl <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> {{or simple}} character {{line in the}} sheetmetal, as hinted in some versions of the Buick Riviera, distinct on the 1968-1969 Skylark, and appearing on the 2008 Invicta concept car. Often optional trim was available to reinforce a plain character line in the bodywork. The feature was re-introduced with the 2nd generation Buick LaCrosse.|$|R

50|$|The 1989 Blazer had new {{base and}} up-level grilles, {{as well as}} new {{headlight}} bezels, body side moldings, and bumper <b>rub</b> <b>strips.</b> Corporate 10-bolt axles were upgraded to 30 spline axle shafts from previous 28 spline. New for 1989 was the introduction of an all-new base coat/clear coat paint. The standard L05 5.7-liter V-8 now had serpentine accessory drive belts in place of the older multi-belt accessory drive.|$|R
5000|$|A lightly revised A111 was {{introduced}} at the 52nd Turin Motor Show in October/November 1970. A distinguishing feature of these [...] "series 2" [...] cars were double-stacked tail lamps, {{of the same}} design seen on the original A111. New bumpers gained <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips</b> but dispensed with the over-riders (bringing overall length to less than four metres), there was new model badging on the tail, and the interior was partly redesigned, including a new centre console and a shorter gear shifter.|$|R
50|$|Three notable {{forms of}} manual therapy are manipulation, {{mobilization}} and massage. Manipulation is the artful {{introduction of a}} rapid rotational, shear or distraction force into an articulation. Manipulation {{is often associated with}} an audible popping sound caused by the instantaneous breakdown of gas bubbles that form during joint cavitation. Mobilization is a slower, more controlled process of articular and soft-tissue (myofascial) stretching intended to improve bio-mechanical elasticity. Massage is typically the repetitive <b>rubbing,</b> <b>stripping</b> or kneading of myofascial tissues to principally improve interstitial fluid dynamics.|$|R
5000|$|Two-door {{hatchback}} and two-door sedan {{models were}} available {{as the base}} Skylark or as the more upscale, European-inspired Skylark S/R ("Sports/Rallye"). Four-door sedans were available as the base Apollo or the more upscale Apollo S/R. In addition, {{there was a very}} plain, lower-priced Skylark [...] "S" [...] available only as a two-door sedan with minimal interior and exterior trim. [...] "VentiPorts" [...] reappeared integrated into the front half of the <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> that ran the length of the vehicle, which had disappeared from Skylarks in 1968.|$|R
50|$|Four {{headlights}} and Rostyle wheels marked out the GT and GXL versions, {{while the}} GXL also had bodyside <b>rub</b> <b>strips,</b> a vinyl roof and a brushed aluminum and black boot lid {{panel on the}} GXLs, while the GTs had a black painted section of the boot with a chrome trim at either site of it. All pre-facelift models featured a downward sloping dashboard with deeply recessed dials and all coil suspension all round. In general styling and technical make up, many observed that the Mark III Cortina aped the Vauxhall Victor FD of 1967.|$|R
50|$|The XR4x4 was now {{based on}} the five-door {{hatchback}} bodystyle and featured different front and rear body-coloured bumper styling, along with wider side <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips.</b> The RS Cosworth, from January 1988, was now {{based on the}} newly introduced saloon bodystyle and featured another style of front bumper {{as well as the}} black grille which was only found on UK versions of the saloon bodystyle. The RS Cosworth received more power and four-wheel drive from January 1990. In addition, a roller cam engine was added in 1987 to prevent excessive wear to the cam.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, the FSO Polonez in economy {{version was}} added. This was sold without black side <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips</b> between {{the front and}} rear wheel, chrome bumper strips, rear window wiper-washer, fog lamps, luggage cover, and rev counter. Plain vinyl was used on the seats and in the luggage compartment. At the other end {{appeared}} the top version, FSO Polonez 1500 X. This was fitted with the AB 1,481 cc engine of , a five-speed gearbox (final drive ratio 4:3), and a radio. It was sold in the domestic market, usually for U.S. dollar payments.|$|R
50|$|Following Ford Australia's {{introduction}} of the BA II Falcon in October 2004, facelifted versions of the Fairlane Ghia, Fairlane G220 and LTD were introduced in March 2005. The changes were mainly cosmetic but nevertheless significant and were carried over in the subsequent BF model ranges. The facelifted Fairlane was headlined by a more heavily chromed exterior, including chrome <b>rub</b> <b>strips,</b> a new chromed rear appliqué and, on Fairlane Ghia and LTD, chromed wing mirror covers. The G220 was given new design seven-spoke alloy wheels, while Fairlane Ghia and LTD added two-tone paint to their side skirts and lower valances.|$|R
5000|$|The Series II was {{introduced}} in 1995 adding over 1000 new features and eliminated the XR6 wagon from the range. A new front suspension {{was introduced}} due to criticism {{that it was too}} [...] "nervous" [...] when handling, another major improvement was the standardisation of a passenger airbag (except the GLi but it was a no cost option). Series II EF Falcons are identifiable by revised hub caps on the GLi model, revised body side <b>rub</b> <b>strips</b> on the Futura, and black B-pillars on the Fairmont Ghia. All EF II Falcons feature a wide-angle convex passenger side door mirror.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{innovation}} is to reduce aircraft noise in the communities surrounding airports by significantly attenuating the noise generated by the turbomachinery, and enhancing safety by providing a containment barrier for a blade failure. Acoustic liners are used in today's turbofan engines to reduce noise. The amount of noise reduction from an acoustic liner {{is a function of}} the treatment area, the liner design, and the material properties, and limited by the constraints of the nacelle or casement design. It is desirable to increase the effective area of the acoustic treatment to increase noise suppression. Modern turbofan engines use wide-chord rotor blades, which means there is considerable treatment area available over the rotor tip. Turbofan engines require containment over the rotors for protection from blade failure. Traditional methods use a material wrap such as Kevlar integrated with <b>rub</b> <b>strips</b> and sometimes metal layers (sandwiches). It is possible to substitute the soft rub-strip material with an open-cell metallic foam that provides noise-reduction benefits and a sacrificial material in the first layer of the containment system. An open-cell foam was evaluated that behaves like a bulk acoustic liner, serves as a tip <b>rub</b> <b>strip,</b> and can be integrated with a rotor containment system. Foams can be integrated with the fan-containment system to provide sufficient safety margins and increased noise attenuation. The major innovation is the integration of the foam with the containment...|$|R
50|$|Another styling {{cue from}} the 1940s through the 1970s was the Sweepspear, a curved trim line running almost {{the length of the}} car. Introduced as an option on the 1949 Buick Roadmaster Riviera hardtop coupe, the {{original}} Sweepspear was a chrome-plated steel <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> which began level over the front wheel, gently curved down across the front fender and door, dove nearly to the rocker panel just ahead of the rear wheel, then flared up and over the rear wheel before leveling off again into a straight run back to the tail-light. The shape of the feature shows similarities to the Jaguar XK120, with the feature running the length of the car in both examples.|$|R
5000|$|...- BR70-13C steel-belted radial ply blackwall tires (with {{option for}} raised white lettering), sport suspension, black {{front and rear}} bumper <b>rub</b> <b>strips,</b> black {{headlights}} frames, black windshield, belt, side and rear window moldings (not available with black exterior), black painted body sill (also not available with black exterior), black door and center pillar louvers, black painted taillight frames, body color front air dam and rear spoiler, Spyder emblems on front facia, rear lock cover and sport steering wheel (horn button insert), black sport mirrors (LH remote, RH manual), rear spoiler and body stripes with Spyder lettering outlined in accent body colour, Spyder hood decal, black painted Rally II wheels with bright trim rings and center caps.|$|R

50|$|Bolsters {{could be}} fixed in place, or be removable. Some {{had as many}} as five bolsters. Some designs had {{multiple}} sockets and a pair of bolsters could be moved between them. The bolsters could even be allowed to swivel around a central locating pin, and curved steel <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips</b> on the wagon deck. The design of bogie bolster wagons had developed from earlier timber wagons: these were short four-wheeled wagons, each carrying a single swivelling bolster. A pair of such wagons could carry a large treetrunk to a sawmill, but they required either the tree to take the full tension of the train or for a suitable number of match wagons to be marshalled between the two bolster wagons. The long, but relatively lightweight, bogie bolster replaced this with a single wagon.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the two-door convertible and hardtop coupe body-styles, a Skylark four-door sedan became available for the first time. Skylarks, however, would continue to {{have higher levels of}} exterior and interior trim compared to the Special and Special Deluxe from which they were derived. All-vinyl bucket seats would be standard on the convertible and optional on the hardtop coupe. The sedan would come with cloth-and-vinyl seats standard, and an all-vinyl interior would be optional. The Sylark Coupe had a lower profile, sitting lower to the road than the Buick Special models. Buick's traditional styling feature called VentiPorts were integrated into the front half <b>rub</b> <b>strip</b> that ran {{the entire length of the}} vehicle, with later versions appearing vertically stacked in a similar implementation on the Buick Wildcat.|$|R
50|$|The Ami Super {{was offered}} in the same three trim levels as the Ami 8, Luxe, Confort and Club on Saloon and Luxe and Confort on Break (estate) versions. These trim {{differences}} were fairly minor with Luxe models having bench front and rear seats and vinyl floor matting. Confort trim offered reclining front seats {{in place of the}} front bench. The Club models can be considered the Pallas of the Ami range featured sound proofing pads on the floor and bulkhead, carpet including boot lining, stainless steel trim on the window frames and side <b>rubbing</b> <b>strips</b> on the doors and rear wings. Club trim was only available up {{to the end of the}} 1973 model year, after that point Ami 8 and Ami super were only available in Luxe and Confort specification.|$|R
