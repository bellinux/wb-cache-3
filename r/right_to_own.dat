He {{received the}} incolatus (or the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> lands in Bohemia) in 1604. After the Diet of Transylvania proclaimed Stephen Bocskai prince in February 1605, Rudolph tried to persuade Sigismund to return to Transylvania, {{but he did not}} accept the offer. The ambassadors of Venice and Spain and the emperor again tried to convince him to lay claim to Transylvania in July 1606, but Sigismund refused, saying that he had no information about the affairs of his former principality. In December he again met Rudolph in Prague, but still resisted the emperor's offer.|$|E

50|$|In many respects, Ugandan women {{hold and}} have held rights that {{exceeded}} those {{of women in}} Western societies. Many Ugandans recognize women as important religious and community leaders. Women have held <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> land, influence crucial political decisions made by men, and cultivate crops for their own profit. When cash-crop agriculture became lucrative, as in southeastern Uganda in the 1920s, men often claimed <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> land <b>owned</b> by their female relatives, and their claims were supported by local councils and protectorate courts.|$|R

25|$|Slave {{women under}} sharia {{did not have}} a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>own</b> {{property}} or to move freely. Sharia, in Islam's history, provided a religious foundation for enslaving non-Muslim women (and men), but allowed for the manumission of slaves.

A non-Muslim slave woman who bore children to her Muslim master became legally free upon her master's death, and her children were presumed to be Muslims like their father, in Africa and elsewhere.|$|E
