5000|$|In divorce suits {{involving}} a foreign spouse, <b>residency</b> <b>status</b> {{is probably the}} number one issue in most cases. The <b>residency</b> <b>status</b> of the spouse {{at the time of}} divorce is the critical factor in the entire equation. The Immigration Control Act of Japan recognizes 27 types of visas, which include various categories such as Spouse Visa, Instructor Visa, Student Visa, Professor Visa, inter alia. Whether divorce will affect the <b>residency</b> <b>status</b> of the individual depends on the visa held at the time of marital dissolution. For example, if the foreign spouse applied for and obtained either Permanent Residency (eijuusha or eijuuken) or Japanese Citizenship (nihon-kokuseki) during the marriage, then they can remain in Japan after the divorce as their <b>residency</b> <b>status</b> is not dependent on their marital status. Basically, any kind of visa which is not reliant on being married will not be affected by divorce and can be renewed as long as the criteria under which it was issued remain valid[...]|$|R

There are virtually no exceptions to this directive. Illegitimate children born to a foreign woman and Japanese father, who is already married, also have a chance of receiving <b>residency</b> <b>status</b> under the 30 July 1996 directive, which allows for a special <b>residency</b> <b>status</b> under these circumstances. In all cases, the Justice Ministry has discretionary power over how soon the visa is granted. At present, the procedure can take one or two years, which causes some mothers severe stress and hardship. The <b>residency</b> <b>status</b> is decided on a case-by-case basis according to the specific circumstances. Generally, the financial situation of the individual is examined and it is determined whether the stated purpose of the visa matches the applicant's situation.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{unilateral}} {{annexation of}} East Jerusalem in 1967, Israel has been manipulating Jerusalem’s demographic balance by Increasing the Jewish population {{and reducing the}} Palestinian population of the city. One {{of the most effective}} measures used to reach this goal is revocation of the permanent <b>residency</b> <b>status</b> of Palestinians living in East Jerusalem. Most East Jerusalem Palestinians are not citizens of Israel, rather they hold a permanent <b>residency</b> <b>status,</b> which may be cancelled at the discretion of Israel’s Minister of Interior. Since 1967, more than 14, 500 residencies were revoked from Palestinian Jerusalemites. More than half of these revocations occurred {{in the last ten years}} (2006 - 2015). During the past fifty years, the grounds on in which Palestinians could face revocation of residency were gradually expanded by Israel’s Minister of Interior and Israel’s Supreme Court. The initial general policy provided that a resident would lose his <b>residency</b> <b>status</b> by “settling outside Israel” for a period of seven years or by receiving the status of resident or citizen in another country. In 1995 Israel suddenly started revoking residencies of Jerusalemites who were residing abroad for less than seven years and had not obtained a <b>residency</b> <b>status</b> or citizenship of a foreign country. According to the new policy, a Palestinian would be considered to have settled outside Israel if his “centre of life” was outside Israel. To make matters worse, Israel now considered the West Bank and Gaza to be abroad. This new criterion led to a new wave of revocations: since 1995 more than 11, 000 residencies have been revoked. In 2006, a new dangerous precedent was set. The Israëli Ministry of Interior decided to revoke the <b>residency</b> <b>status</b> of four East Jerusalem Palestinians, because they violated the minimal obligation of loyalty to the state of Israel, thus imposing a duty of allegiance to Israel on East Jerusalem Palestinians. A petition questioning the legality of residency revocations based on this new criterion is still pending before the Supreme Court. In January 2016, without awaiting the Courts decision on the legality of this new policy, Israel’s Interior Minister punitively revoked the <b>residency</b> <b>status</b> of four East Jerusalem Palestinians who allegedly committed criminal acts. nrpages: 32 status: publishe...|$|R
