30|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to {{establish}} a method for evaluating test data obtained in kiln-drying lumber. Experimental data on <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>drying</b> of sugi (Cryptomeria japonica) beams without pith were used to present a data evaluation method for the length of internal checks of kiln-dried lumber based on a hierarchical model. Occurrence of the internal check phenomenon was determined with the underlying data-generating process, and the length of internal checks was modeled in relation to heating temperature, initial moisture content, final moisture content, and basic density. The diagnosis of the posterior model parameters revealed that heating temperature, initial moisture content, and basic density have a positive influence on the occurrence of internal checks, while final moisture content has a negative influence. A comparison between the developed hierarchical model and conventional statistical analysis used in research on lumber drying showed that a much more detailed analysis of internal check length could be performed by the hierarchical model.|$|E

Using inexpensive vacuum pumps and simple condensers it {{was estimated to be}} about one-tenth of the cost of freeze <b>drying.</b> <b>Radio-frequency</b> heating also became used in the manufacture of plastic raincoats, bags and other products.|$|R
30|$|A {{new method}} for {{monitoring}} moisture content during <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF)/vacuum <b>drying</b> {{was developed by}} measurement of temperature and pressure in wood. Temperature and pressure inside the wood were measured simultaneously during RF/vacuum drying at the same point. The relative humidity (RH) and moisture content (MC) below the fiber saturation point (FSP) were calculated based on temperature and pressure, {{and the relationship between}} the temperature, RH, and equilibrium moisture content (EMC) at the measurement point. When the moisture content was below the FSP, the calculated MC was slightly greater than the value given by oven drying. The absolute error was within 0.8 % near the open cross side, and was within 1.8 % at another measurement point. Thus, we concluded that it was practicable to monitor the moisture content below the FSP according to the temperature and pressure inside the wood.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{two-dimensional}} {{analysis of}} heat and mass transfer during <b>radio-frequency</b> assisted convective <b>drying</b> of a rectangular apple slice is performed using an implicit finite difference method. Temperature and moisture distributions inside the object are predicted. Effects of level of power density and heat transfer coefficient on moisture and temperature profiles in the product are evaluated. It is shown that increasing the level of power denstiy and heat transfer coefficient increase the temperature and decrease the moisture in the product. The results obtained from the present model are compared with those available the literature and a considerably good agreement is found...|$|R
30|$|Understanding {{the final}} MC {{distribution}} {{is very important}} in the probabilistic analysis, because classical parametric statistics {{is based on the assumption}} of a specific probabilistic distribution. Rice and Shepard [1] extensively measured the MC of about 3500 eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) lumbers from 14 kiln charges that were dried in 7 sawmills. Substantial MC variation existed within a given charge and between kilns at each sawmill, and most of the MC distributions were found to be different from Normal distribution. Milota et al. [7] calculated the final MC distribution of mixed hem-fir species and mountain hemlock (Tsuga mertensiana) using a computer simulation, and showed that a number of slowly drying boards tended to skew the MC distribution toward the right. Tenori and Moya [8] and Moya et al. [9] statistically evaluated a variability in the final MC of kiln-dried lumber from plantations in Costa Rica. In the statistical analysis, the normality assumption was assessed, and positive skewness was found in the distribution [9]. The factors affecting the variability in the final MC of kiln-dried lumber was also examined using Pearson’s correlation matrix [10] and general linear model [11], assuming that the final MC follows a Normal distribution. Numerical stochastic models have been intensively developed to simulate the MC dispersion during and after conventional drying [12, 13] and <b>radio-frequency</b> vacuum <b>drying</b> [14 – 16]. The developed stochastic models could be used to reproduce the final MC distributions, and some of the simulated distributions had a long right tail [12, 14]. The results of the above studies indicate that the final MC does not necessarily follow a normal distribution. However, as far as we know, a comprehensive evaluation of the final MC in relation to probabilistic distribution has not been carried out. Moreover, the final MC data have been assessed using only descriptive statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and the percentage of the population whose MC is within or without the target MC range. The inference of these parameters has not been attempted at all, which means that no uncertainty assessment of the final MC has been carried out. Therefore, establishing a probabilistic evaluation method of the final MC is an important research endeavor.|$|R
