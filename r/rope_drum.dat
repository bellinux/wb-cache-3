500|$|Terence Blanchard {{composed}} the film score, marking his twelfth collaboration with Lee. For the score, {{he attempted to}} make a distinction between American and German soldiers. [...] "That was first done through the use of percussion, using a higher-pitched, tighter sound for Germans, and a fuller-field drum sound for Americans," [...] he explained. [...] "I also drew a distinction by using French horns for American forces, and a Wagner tuben for German forces." [...] Scoring the film required the use of a 90-piece orchestra, which was larger than in any of Lee's previous films. [...] Blanchard also relied on the use of instruments from the 1940s era, including a mandolin, accordion, slide guitar and <b>rope</b> <b>drum.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{additional}} feature sometimes {{fitted to}} the crane, used {{to restrict the}} tendency of the grab to rotate on the axis of the holding ropes, is a tagline (sometimes {{referred to as a}} grabline) mechanism. The design can vary but is typically a coiled spring contained within a horizontal tube with a <b>rope</b> <b>drum</b> on the end.|$|E
50|$|To {{demolish}} {{roofs and}} other horizontal spans, {{the ball is}} typically suspended by a length of steel chain attached to the lifting hook of a crane boom above the structure, the <b>rope</b> <b>drum</b> clutch is released and the ball is allowed to free-fall onto the structure. To demolish walls the ball is suspended at the desired height from a crane boom and a secondary steel rope pulls the ball toward the crane cab. The lateral <b>rope</b> <b>drum</b> clutch is then released and the ball swings as a pendulum to strike the structure. Another method for lateral demolition is to pivot the crane boom to accelerate the ball toward the target. This is repeated as needed until the structure is broken down into debris that can easily be loaded and hauled away. The demolition action is carried out entirely through the kinetic energy of the ball.|$|E
5000|$|Moeller {{was also}} an expert drum builder. He made several deep marching snares and {{matching}} bass drums. Today, his vintage-style <b>rope</b> <b>drums</b> are still being played by marching organizations.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Cable Driving Plant, Designed and Constructed by Poole & Hunt, Baltimore, MD. Drawing by P.F. Goist, circa 1882. The {{powerhouse}} has two horizontal single-cylinder engines. The lithograph shows {{a hypothetical}} prototype of a cable powerhouse, {{rather than any}} actual built structure. [...] Poole & Hunt, machinists and engineers, was a major cable industry designer and contractor and manufacturer of gearing, sheaves, shafting and wire <b>rope</b> <b>drums.</b> They did work for cable railways in Baltimore, Chicago, Hoboken, Kansas City, New York, and Philadelphia.|$|R
5000|$|The Herald Trumpets use a {{combination}} of E-flat, B-flat mezzo-soprano, B-flat tenor, and bass herald trumpets custom-manufactured by Kanstul Musical Instruments. Each trumpet is dressed with a ceremonial tabard emblazoned with the heraldic achievement of the U.S. Army Band. The unit's <b>rope</b> <b>drums,</b> as with those {{of the rest of the}} U.S. Army Band, are manufactured by the Cooperman Drum Company and are painted with an emblem known as [...] "the Grand Republic," [...] which was designed by Gus Moeller. The drum heads are made of kevlar.|$|R
50|$|In the era {{of sailing}} ships, the {{introduction}} of a worm drive to control the rudder was a significant advance. Prior to its introduction, a <b>rope</b> <b>drum</b> drive controlled the rudder. Rough seas could apply substantial force to the rudder, often requiring several men to steer the vessel—some drives had two large-diameter wheels so up to four crewmen could operate the rudder.|$|E
50|$|The early mills had a {{vertical}} shaft {{to take the}} power from the flywheel. On each floor horizontal shafts engaged with the main shaft using bevel gearing. American mills used thick leather bands instead of shafts. A new approach was to use thick cotton ropes. A <b>rope</b> <b>drum</b> {{was attached to the}} flywheel with a channel cut for each rope. The profile was such to give maximum adherence.|$|E
50|$|The Lily {{features}} a Flemish brake design which incorporates a <b>rope</b> <b>drum</b> which lifts a loaded lever {{which in turn}} pulls a set of wooden blocks tightly around the windshaft (the shaft the sails are mounted on). This brake design {{which is similar to}} a band brake is very effective when the sails are facing the wind, but much less so when the wind is coming from behind. For this reason a ‘kneppel’ is installed which prevents counter-rotation of the sails when the windmill has stopped.|$|E

50|$|The company added new {{products}} to its catalog, such as snare drums and timpani in 1916. In 1917, Ludwig {{signed a deal}} to build <b>rope</b> <b>drums</b> to support World War I. Theobald Ludwig died in 1918 and William continued on his own. By 1923, the factory was the largest drum manufacturer in the world, employing 240 workers. In the late 20's, the company was sold to the C.G. Conn instrument company. William Ludwig stayed on to run the company for Conn (which also owned the Leedy Drum Co. at this time). Eventually, William Ludwig decided to leave Conn and start a new company of his own. He was unable to use the Ludwig name since that trademark now belonged to Conn who continued to market Ludwig & Ludwig drums.|$|R
5000|$|The ashiko [...] is a drum, {{shaped like}} a tapered {{cylinder}} (or truncated cone) with the head on the wide end, and the narrow end open.

50|$|The winding {{engine was}} {{replaced}} in 1869 by one with 2 horizontal cylinders 25in bore and 60in stroke. They had double beat valves. The <b>rope</b> <b>drum</b> was 14 ft in diameter. This engine {{was still working}} in 1926 when the pit closed. A further engine was installed to haul tubs up a 900yard, 1 in 7 incline in the Accommodation seam. It had two horizontal cylinders 15in by 30in geared to a five-foot winding drum. Both were fed steam at 30 psi by three Lancashire Boilers.|$|E
50|$|A horse gin is {{on display}} at the Nottingham Industrial Museum. It was {{constructed}} in 1841 to sink the Langton Colliery shaft and moved in 1844 to Pinxton Green Colliery. It was still working in 1950 and it was erected in the museum in 1967. It was used at a pit head to raise coal to the surface. The Nottingham mines were shallow, coal was moved to the shaft on a sled, which was raised in a cage by a rope attached to a <b>rope</b> <b>drum</b> that was turned by the horses in the gin.|$|E

40|$|The boundary-value problem about {{construction}} of the displacement waves and the strain waves arising in ropes of elevating devices, such as lifts, mine lifts and so on is considered. The rope at lifting of loads is reeled up on a drum. In a case when the friction coefficient of a <b>rope</b> about a <b>drum</b> is not too big, occurs frictional sliding a <b>rope</b> on a <b>drum.</b> Therefore {{the behavior of a}} <b>rope</b> on a <b>drum</b> is described by the telegraph equation. The behavior of a hanging part of a rope is described by the wave equation. It means, that in different parts of a rope the displacements are solutions of the different equations. That is {{from this point of view}} the rope is shared on two zones. Thus owing to reeling of a <b>rope</b> on a <b>drum</b> the border which shares these two zones is a variable. In such model the waves not only reflect from ending points of a rope. There is also their reflection and refraction on moving border of the sharing of zones. Is developed methods for obtaining of exact solutions for the boundary-value problems with mobile borders for both the wave and telegraph equations. They are based on maintenance of a continuity of the displacements in points of reflection of waves. The exact solution of such problem is obtained for the case of sagging a rope prior to the beginning of rise. </span...|$|R
