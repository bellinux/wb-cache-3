Starting from the Chargers' 46-yard line, the Patriots drove to the Chargers' 1-yard line on seven plays, four of which were Faulk runs, and then scored on a 1-yard Morris {{touchdown}} run that cut the Chargers' lead to 30–10 with just over five minutes {{to play in the}} game.

500|$|Some bowlers had {{experimented with}} Bodyline in the season, and the West Indian team, 1–0 {{down in the}} series and {{frustrated}} {{by the lack of}} pace in the pitches, decided to experiment with the tactic. Facing a good West Indies total, England suffered a batting collapse, at one point falling to 134 for four. With Les Ames in difficulty against the short-pitched bowling, Jardine said, [...] "You get yourself down this end, Les. I'll take care of this bloody nonsense." [...] He went <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bouncers, standing on tiptoe, and stopped them with a dead bat, sometimes playing the ball one handed for more control. Wisden described how he never flinched despite facing the greatest amount of Bodyline. It also believed that he played it [...] "probably better than any other man in the world was capable of doing." [...] He batted for nearly five hours, scoring 127, his only Test century. England then retaliated by bowling Bodyline in the West Indies' second innings, but the slow pitch meant that the match was drawn. However, this performance played a large part in turning English opinion against Bodyline. The Times used the word [...] "Bodyline", without using inverted commas or using the qualification [...] "so-called", for the first time. Wisden said that [...] "most of those watching {{it for the first time}} must have come to the conclusion that, while strictly within the law, it was not nice." ...|$|E

500|$|Jardine {{himself had}} to face bodyline bowling in a Test match. The West Indian cricket team toured England in 1933, and, in the second Test at Old Trafford, Jackie Grant, their captain, decided to try bodyline. He {{had a couple of}} fast bowlers, Manny Martindale and Learie Constantine. Facing bodyline tactics for the first time, England first suffered, falling to 134 for 4, with Wally Hammond being hit on the chin, though he {{recovered}} to continue his innings. Then Jardine himself faced Martindale and Constantine. Jardine never flinched. With Les Ames finding himself in difficulties, Jardine said, [...] "You get yourself down this end, Les. I'll take care of this bloody nonsense." [...] He played <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bouncers, standing on tiptoe, and played them with a dead bat, sometimes playing the ball one handed for more control. While the Old Trafford pitch was not as suited to bodyline as the hard Australian wickets, Martindale did take 5 for 73, but Constantine only took 1 for 55. Jardine himself made 127, his only Test century. In the West Indian second innings, Clark bowled bodyline back to the West Indians, taking 2 for 64. The match in the end was drawn but played a large part in turning English opinion against bodyline. The Times used the word bodyline, without using inverted commas or using the qualification so-called, for the first time. Wisden also said that [...] "most of those watching {{it for the first time}} must have come to the conclusion that, while strictly within the law, it was not nice." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the first}} series of Torchwood, Gwen functioned as an {{audience}} surrogate. Russell T Davies likened her character type {{to that of}} 2005–06 Doctor Who lead female Rose Tyler (Billie Piper): [...] "She is the ordinary person who stumbles into something extraordinary and finds herself their equal." [...] Eve Myles characterised Gwen as an ambitious and feisty young woman, who {{at the same time}} embodies many aspects of the girl next door archetype. [...] Her distinct role within the team {{stems from the fact that}} [...] "she's there for the people", who she feels [...] "instinctive and passionate" [...] about. Producer Richard Stokes noted that Gwen possesses more [...] "human empathy" [...] than the more mercenary members of the team, who are seen to be [...] "technology-and-alien-obsessed". In this vein, lead actor John Barrowman commented that Gwen brings a [...] "little bit of soul" [...] back to Jack. Describing the ways in which Gwen's methods differ from the rest of the team, Myles explained how her police procedural training relates to the job: [...] "she deals with the families, she deals with profiling, she deals with searching people's backgrounds. It's a new way of working she brings in". Myles stated that Gwen would have made a [...] "fantastic policewoman" [...] prior to joining Torchwood, drawing on the character's ability to get vulnerable characters to [...] "open up by making them feel comfortable". Myles perceived Gwen to be [...] "the heart and emotion of Torchwood", and [...] "Torchwood's social worker" [...] who can [...] "run and fight and stand in her own corner and win". Gaining insight into Torchwood through curiosity, Gwen becomes part of Torchwood because they need her, just as she needs them. Gwen's friendship with former colleague Andy is used by the production team to juxtapose her extraordinary life with a mundane one, as well as highlighting her transformation into a harder woman. Andy is present immediately before Gwen first encounters Torchwood, and Myles feels his later appearances [...] "takes you <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beginning, it reminds you where she came from, how Jack found Gwen". Myles observed that Gwen's many facets prevent her from getting bored; she feels constantly challenged [...] "physically", [...] "mentally" [...] and [...] "morally" [...] through portraying the character.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Doctor Who Magazine, actor Tom Price states {{that one of the}} original producers had originally wanted to kill Andy off in the first series as he was such a peripheral character. Executive producer Julie Gardner felt that it suited to have Andy return later in the series as it maintains a sense of continuity. She believes that there's a palpable relationship between Gwen and Andy. Director Brian Kelly opines that it makes perfect sense for Andy to return in episode thirteen as [...] "he is the person who would phone Gwen" [...] in a crisis situation. Eve Myles, who portrays Gwen, believes that Price conveys the humorous aspects of Andy's character [...] "fantastically", which enables her as an actress to understand the friendship between the characters. Myles also feels that Andy plays a crucial part in reminding viewers of Gwen's development; when he reappears [...] "it takes you <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beginning, it reminds you where she came from, how Jack found Gwen". Price enumerates that by the second series Andy is used by the production team as a [...] "pressure valve" [...] to relieve tension.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{reversal}} of fortune was Egypt's operational pause from 7 to 14 October. After capturing parts of the Sinai, the Egyptian campaign halted and the Syrians were left fighting the Israelis alone. The Egyptian leaders, believing their war aims accomplished, dug in. While their early successes in the war had surprised them, War Minister General Ahmad Ismail Ali advised caution. In Syria, Assad and his generals waited for the Egyptians to move. When the Israeli government learned of Egypt's modest war strategy, it ordered an [...] "immediate continuous action" [...] against the Syrian military. According to Patrick Seale, [...] "For three days, 7, 8, and 9 October, Syrian troops on the Golan faced the full fury of the Israeli air force as, from first light to nightfall, wave after wave of aircraft swooped down to bomb, strafe and napalm their tank concentration and their fuel and ammunition carriers <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Purple Line." [...] By 9 October, the Syrians were retreating behind the Purple Line (the Israeli–Syrian border since the Six-Day War). By 13 October the war was lost, but (in contrast to the Six-Day War) the Syrians were not crushed; this earned Assad respect in Syria and abroad.|$|E
