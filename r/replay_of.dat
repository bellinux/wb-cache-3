5|$|Milne {{dropped down}} two {{divisions}} to join Bristol City for a £50,000 fee in January 1988. City ended the 1987–88 {{campaign in the}} play-offs, but failed to gain promotion after losing 4–0 to Walsall in a <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> the play-off final.|$|E
5|$|He {{was also}} noted as a joker on the pitch. After the <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> the Scottish Cup Final against Celtic in 1963 he stuffed the match ball up {{his shirt and}} later gave it to a new member of the team. The SFA insisted that the ball should be returned, and Rangers sent them a ball, but {{possibly}} not the match ball.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Wenger offered Sheffield United a <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> their FA Cup fifth round match {{immediately}} after the match had finished, due to the controversial circumstances {{in which it was}} won. The decisive goal was scored by Overmars after Kanu failed to return the ball to the opposition; it was kicked into touch to allow Sheffield United's Lee Morris to receive treatment for an injury. Arsenal {{went on to win the}} replayed match 2–1.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool were {{appearing}} in their seventh final. They had won four (1981, 1982, 1983, 1984) and lost two (1978, 1987). Bolton were {{appearing in}} their first final, they had previously reached the semi-finals during the 1976–77 Football League Cup. The last meeting {{between the two sides}} was on 13 January 1993, in a <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> their third round tie in the 1992–93 FA Cup. Bolton won the match 2–0.|$|E
5|$|Before the event, the GFW {{broadcasts}} experienced setbacks. Many {{cable companies}} {{decided not to}} air the event live, opting instead for a <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> UFC 182, and the stream would not run on {{three of the four}} most used devices compatible with Flipps: Chromecast, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. According to Dave Meltzer, NJPW undercut GFW by including the event in the $8.42 monthly price for New Japan Pro Wrestling World; the GFW broadcast of Wrestle Kingdom 9 alone was $34.95. The New Japan Pro Wrestling World stream had Japanese commentary only.|$|E
5|$|McDonald {{became the}} 21st player in NHL history to score 400 career goals, {{reaching}} the mark in a 7–4 loss in Los Angeles on December 21, 1983. He was initially credited with scoring the milestone goal {{in his previous}} game, against the Winnipeg Jets, but after reviewing a <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> the goal himself, McDonald asked the league to credit it to teammate Eddy Beers who had deflected his shot. His injury problems worsened in 1984–85 as he missed {{the start of the}} season with pulled muscles and was limited to just 43games.|$|E

They played the Stormers at Jade Stadium in their semi-final, and won 27–16. They met the Brumbies at Canberra Stadium in a <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> the 2000 final. The Brumbies dominated in the final, scoring 33 unanswered points in the first 19 minutes. The Crusaders managed to salvage some pride by narrowing the loss to a 47–38 finish.|$|E
5|$|The Cubs, led by Tinker, Evers, and Chance, won the National League pennant in 1906, 1907, 1908, and 1910. In 1908, the Cubs {{clinched}} the pennant after defeating the Giants {{in part due}} to Merkle's Boner. In the Merkle game, Tinker hit a home run off Christy Mathewson, and Evers alerted umpire Hank O'Day to Merkle's baserunning gaffe. In the <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> the Merkle game, Tinker hit a triple off Mathewson that started the rally that gave the Cubs the victory, clinching the pennant.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} was contested between Stabæk and Vålerenga at Telenor Arena in Bærum on 8March2009. It {{was the first}} {{official}} match to take place at Stabæk's new home ground. Stabæk qualified as winners of the 2008 Norwegian Premier League, where they finished six points ahead of Fredrikstad. Vålerenga qualified as winners of the 2008 Norwegian Football Cup, where they had won the final 4–1 against Stabæk. As such, Superfinalen became a <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> the previous year's cup final. Stabæk won the match 3–1 after goals by Daniel Nannskog, Daigo Kobayashi and Pálmi Rafn Pálmason. Mohammed Abdellaoue scored for the losing side. Martin Andresen, playing coach for Vålerenga, received two yellow cards.|$|E

5|$|Whilst playing {{part-time}} for Distillery he {{also worked}} at the Harland and Wolff shipbuilding company. Though the maximum wage in England discouraged many of Belfast's top players from leaving their hometown, Dougan was determined {{to leave for the}} English Football League at the earliest opportunity, particularly so following the death of his mother in June 1955. He began to attract scouts from England after helping Distillery beat Glentoran 1–0 in the second <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> the 1956 final of the Irish Cup at Windsor Park. He played mostly at half-back in the 1956–57 season as Distillery finished sixth in the Irish League and ended up as runners-up in the Ulster Cup, City Cup, and County Antrim Shield.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E
5|$|Following a 0–0 draw with Manchester United in the 1977 FA Charity Shield, {{a disappointing}} {{start to the}} 1977–78 season saw Liverpool out of the title race early on whilst they exited the FA Cup at the Third Round. They did though recover to post a second-place finish in the league after winning nine of their last 12 matches, to end the {{campaign}} seven points behind Nottingham Forest. They progressed to the League Cup Final after Kennedy scored the winning goal past former club Arsenal in the semi-final. However Liverpool lost out 1–0 to Nottingham Forest in the <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> the final at Old Trafford. Despite these domestic disappointments, Liverpool went on to reach {{the final of the}} European Cup after defeating Dynamo Dresden, Benfica (Portugal), and Borussia Mönchengladbach; Mönchengladbach manager Udo Lattek singled out Kennedy as the best player of the semi-final, as Kennedy scored a goal and provided assists for both Kenny Dalglish and Jimmy Case in the second leg. In the final Liverpool faced Club Brugge at Wembley, and successfully defended the trophy after seeing out a 1–0 win.|$|E

5|$|In a <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> the 2007 World Cup final, the German team drew 0–0 with Brazil in {{the opening}} game at the 2008 Summer Olympics. They then beat both Nigeria and North Korea {{to advance to the}} quarter-final, where they {{defeated}} Sweden 2–0 after extra time. In the semi-final, Germany again met Brazil. Birgit Prinz scored in the 10th minute, but the German team lost 1–4 after conceding three goals to Brazilian counter-attacks in the second half. They beat Japan 2–0 for the bronze medal, with Fatmire Bajramaj scoring both goals. The third consecutive semi-final loss at the Olympics was seen as a disappointment by both the players and the German press. The team's overall performance and head coach Silvia Neid were harshly criticised in the media.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{retained}} the Charity Shield by beating West Ham United 1–0, however despite only losing eight league games all season they won 17 and drew 17 of their remaining fixtures and ended the 1980–81 season in fifth place, nine points behind champions Aston Villa. In the League Cup, they knocked out Bradford City, Swindon Town, Portsmouth, Birmingham City, and Manchester City {{to reach the}} final against West Ham United. They then beat West Ham 2–1 in a <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> the final to claim the first League Cup in the club's history. They also reached the European Cup final after getting past Oulun Palloseura (Finland), Aberdeen (Scotland), CSKA Sofia (Bulgaria), and Bayern Munich (Germany). In the semi-final against Bayern, Kennedy was named as captain as both Graeme Souness and Phil Thompson were injured, {{and went on to}} score what proved to be the winning away goal at the Olympiastadion, cementing his reputation as a semi-final specialist. Liverpool then beat Spanish club Real Madrid 1–0 in a dour final to win a third European Cup.|$|E
5|$|There {{are five}} main plot lines that the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story.

5|$|During {{the longest}} season in Iraqi football, the 1992–93 season, when every club played 69 matches, Al-Talaba had Yahya Alwan as their {{manager in the}} first stage of the league, in which they won 14 matches, drawn seven and lost two, 1–0 against Kirkuk and the same score against Samarra. They {{completed}} the stage in third place with 35 points. Before the start of the second stage, Al-Talaba signed Ayoub Odisho as their new manager, and he led them through the second stage to have exactly the same statistics as the first one, finishing with 70 points and in second place. In the third stage, the team won 18 matches, drew four and lost only once against Al-Khutoot. After 69 matches, Al-Talaba finished top of the league with 110 points, having scored 130 goals and conceded 34. In the 1992 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup which was organised by the Iraq FA, Al-Talaba finished the group stage as the Group Two leaders with four points. In the semi-finals, they had to face Al-Zawra'a in a match which was considered a <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> the 1991 semi-final which Al-Zawra'a won 1–0. In this match, Al-Talaba won 3–2 with a golden goal in the 100th minute during extra time. In the final against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, the match ended in a 0–0 draw which led to extra time when Alaa Kadhim scored the winning goal in the 104th minute. In the 1992–93 Iraq FA Cup, Al-Talaba reached the final after defeating Haifa, Salahaddin, Salam and Samarra. In the final, they lost to Al-Zawra'a 2–1.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the game, Derek Jeter and Albert Pujols were named winners of the Hank Aaron Award for their {{offensive}} performances in 2009. This was the first game to test manager Joe Girardi's decision to use a three-man starting rotation, as CC Sabathia started the game on three days rest, a shorter period than he normally got during the regular season. Jeter led the game off with a single and advanced to third base on a double by Johnny Damon. Jeter scored via a Mark Teixeira ground out and Alex Rodriguez was hit by a pitch. Rodriguez was hit twice the night before and the umpires issued warnings to both benches. Jorge Posada then added to the Yankees lead that inning with a sacrifice fly. The Phillies answered quickly, scoring a run on successive doubles by Shane Victorino and Chase Utley in the bottom of the first. Sabathia intentionally walked Jayson Werth, but escaped the inning without further scoring. The Phillies tied the game in the bottom of the fourth as Ryan Howard singled, stole second, and scored on a single by Pedro Feliz. Although the run counted, instant <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> Howard's slide later showed that he did not touch home plate.|$|E
5|$|However, {{although}} the spectators {{would now be}} able to see the players at night, they still suffered from the problem of obstructed views caused by the pillars that supported the roofs. With the 1966 FIFA World Cup fast approaching, this prompted the United directors to completely redesign the United Road (north) stand. The old roof pillars were replaced in 1965 with modern-style cantilevering on top of the roof, allowing every spectator a completely unobstructed view, while it was also expanded to hold 20,000 spectators (10,000 seated and 10,000 standing in front) at a cost of £350,000. The architects of the new stand, Mather and Nutter (now Atherden Fuller), rearranged the organisation of the stand to have terracing at the front, a larger seated area towards the back, and the first private boxes at a British football ground. The east stand – the only remaining uncovered stand – was developed in the same style in 1973. With the first two stands converted to cantilevers, the club's owners devised a long-term plan to do the same to the other two stands and convert the stadium into a bowl-like arena. Such an undertaking would serve to increase the atmosphere within the ground by containing the crowd's noise and focusing it onto the pitch, where the players would feel the full effects of a capacity crowd. Meanwhile, the stadium hosted its third FA Cup Final, hosting 62,078 spectators for the <b>replay</b> <b>of</b> the 1970 final between Chelsea and Leeds United; Chelsea won the match 2–1. The ground also hosted the second leg of the 1968 Intercontinental Cup, which saw Estudiantes de La Plata win the cup after a 1–1 draw. The 1970s saw the dramatic rise of football hooliganism in Britain, and a knife-throwing incident in 1971 forcing the club to erect the country's first perimeter fence, restricting fans from the Old Trafford pitch.|$|E
