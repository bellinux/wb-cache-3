500|$|And the Band Played On was {{critically}} acclaimed {{and became a}} best-seller. Judith Eannarino of the Library Journal called it [...] "one {{of the most important}} books of the year", upon its release. It made Shilts both a star and a pariah for his coverage of the disease and the bitter politics in the gay community. He described his motivation to undertake the writing of the book in an interview after its release, saying, [...] "Any good reporter could have done this story, but I think the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it, and no one else did, is because I am gay. It was happening to people I cared about and loved." [...] The book was later adapted into an HBO film of the same name in 1993. Shilts was tested for HIV while he was writing the book; he died of complications from AIDS in 1994.|$|E
2500|$|Campese {{later wrote}} that, [...] "I was blamed for letting a kick from the French left wing, Patrice Lagisquet, bounce late in our semi-final against France at the Concord Oval, and the French {{picked up the}} loose ball {{to go on and}} score after a bewildering {{movement}} involving 11 passes. However, he later explained that, [...] "The <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not catch Lagisquet's kick ahead near the end, when the scores were level at 24-24, was that I slipped in the mud trying to reach it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Klaw also {{produced}} {{a line of}} still photos taken during these sessions. Some have become iconic images, such as his highest-selling photo of Page—shown gagged and bound {{in a web of}} ropes, from the film Leopard Bikini Bound. Although these [...] "underground" [...] features had the same crude style and clandestine distribution as the pornographic [...] "stag" [...] films of the time, Klaw's all-female films (and still photos) never featured any nudity or explicit sexual content. Commenting on the bondage photos and the reputation they afforded her, Page said retrospectively: They keep referring to me in the magazines and newspapers and everywhere else as the [...] "Queen of Bondage." [...] The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order to get paid you had to do an hour of bondage. And that was the only <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it. I never had any inkling along that line. I don’t really disapprove of it; I think you can do your own thing as long as you’re not hurting anybody else — that’s been my philosophy ever since I was a little girl. I never looked down my nose at it. In fact, we used to laugh at some of the requests that came through the mail, even from judges and lawyers and doctors and people in high positions. Even back in the ’50s they went in for the whips and the ties and everything else.|$|E
60|$|I {{glanced out}} of the window. For many <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not wish to prolong this interview.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} marry him. There are two <b>reasons</b> why <b>I</b> should not. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not love him, {{and he does}} not love me. There are two other <b>reasons.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want to marry him, {{and he does not}} want to marry me." ...|$|R

For this <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not include indicator variables for non-cognitive abilities and estimate a latent factor. This choice allows me {{to focus on the}} nature and not on the nurture effect.|$|R
6000|$|COSMO, {{who has not}} yet {{learned to}} leave well alone, 'But the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it {{was that we were}} all boys. Were there no young ladies where you did it, mother?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're safe enough, I guess. It was {{a mighty}} neat job, Cerise, taken altogether, {{although}} the fools {{have been watching}} me night and day. That's the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not come sooner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} sick for two months," [...] he said. [...] "I am still weak. That is the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{put up a}} better fight when those two men tackled me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As regards your {{personal}} attractions," [...] Tavernake replied, [...] "I {{imagine that they}} {{are at least as}} great as ever. If you want the truth, I think that the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not adore you any longer is because I saw your sister last night." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{gave her}} {{one or two}} <b>reasons</b> why <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not {{altogether}} hate them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know a sight {{more than}} you, if that's what you mean," [...] {{retorted}} Tom. [...] "It stands to <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> You're {{not a man}} of any education; you've been all your life at sea, or in the islands; you don't suppose you can give points to a man like me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was for a}} <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not want}} to mention {{the name of the}} person who was {{actually}} in my mind. Miss Howard occupied very much the same position, so I used her name instead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you see, father," [...] said Agnes, earnestly, [...] "the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{that was}} because when I roasted them in {{anything}} shallow they popped into the fire, {{but they could not}} jump out of the diploma case." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's one <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it," [...] said I. [...] "I didn't want {{to fight}} him as I should have fought a fellow of my own size. I wanted to punish him. Do you think that when a father wants to whip his son he ought to wait until he grows up as big as he is?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Ad--Ad--Admiral is well in health, but worse mentally," [...] he answered. [...] "I am {{leaving for}} that very <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{conceive}} that in fairness to myself I should continue to waste my time in work which can bring forth no fruit. I trust, Miss Merton, that you agree with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not need}} such {{faithful}} watchers," [...] he said politely, standing up on a branch, [...] "but I will remember this. Ye be true dholes, but to my thinking over much of one kind. For that <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not give the big lizard-eater his tail again. Art thou not pleased, Red Dog?" ...|$|R
5000|$|On 17 May 2011, it was {{announced}} by Halifax Town that they had signed McManus from FC United. McManus said: [...] "I'm sorry I had to leave - the only <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so were for {{a greater degree of}} financial security so I can support my daughter, and to help progress my football career at a higher level." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what brings}} you down here?" [...] she asked, with the same searching look. [...] "You don't come down into this hole without some good <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> think at first that you might come down {{in order to see}} me, but you soon showed me that it wasn't that. There was a time when you was fond of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Be silent,' I said, for I {{saw that}} if he went on thus he would throw himself into a fever, which might cause the {{operation}} to prove fatal. For the same <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not question him about many things I should have liked to learn. I lit my fire and boiled the instruments--he thought I was making magic. By the time that everything was ready the sun was up.|$|E
60|$|Not that I drank at that time. From ten {{to fifteen}} I rarely tasted liquor, but I was intimately in contact with {{drinkers}} and drinking places. The only <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not drink was because I didn't like the stuff. As the time passed, I worked as boy-helper on an ice-wagon, set up pins in a bowling alley with a saloon attached, and swept out saloons at Sunday picnic grounds.|$|E
5000|$|Bishop Thomas Bickerton is the {{chairperson}} of the executive committee for Imagine No Malaria. He stated, [...] "Today there's a 3-year-old who's going to be bitten by a tiny bug, and, in 48 hours, {{she is going to}} die. She's the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> what <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> To make the world a healthy place for every child {{has everything to do with}} what Mr. Wesley intended us to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Ralph," [...] persisted his sister, [...] "I don't {{want to ask}} her to {{stop her}} cooking and go out and get wood. It does not look like good management, for one thing, and for other <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want to do it. Don't you think you could bring her some wood? Just a little basketful of short sticks will do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I do not think, Mr. Foley, that I {{have any}} longer {{a claim to}} your friendship, since Mr. Barting appears to have {{withdrawn}} his own from me--for what <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> protest <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know. If he has not already informed you he probably will do so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I am {{glad that}} you obeyed me so readily," [...] said her mother. [...] "I knew you would obey me at once, without my giving any <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not wish {{to tell you the}} reason, for fear of {{frightening}} you while you were passing by the tree. But I knew that you would obey me without any reason. You always do, and that is why I always like to have you go with me when I take a walk." ...|$|E
60|$|The fellow, {{instead of}} approaching, merely stood and stared; his eyes bulging and his jaw dropped. And then another savage face appeared, {{and a third}} and fourth and fifth, craning their necks over the {{shoulders}} of their fellows whom they could not pass upon the narrow ledge. Each face was the picture of awe and fear, but for what <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know, nor did I learn until ten years later. That there were still other braves behind those who regarded me was apparent {{from the fact that}} the leaders passed back whispered word to those behind them.|$|E
60|$|The only <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not go {{was that}} I felt too tired. The very {{thought of the}} effort to swim over was nauseating. So I called to the kanaka to come to me, and {{proceeded}} to share the hatch-cover with him. Otoo, he told me his name was (pronounced o-to-o); also, {{he told me that he}} was a native of Bora Bora, the most westerly of the Society Group. As I learned afterward, he had got the hatch-cover first, and, after some time, encountering Captain Oudouse, had offered to share it with him, and had been kicked off for his pains.|$|E
5000|$|I {{never read}} a book before {{translating}} it. No <b>reason</b> to. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not translate the words literally. Only a bad translator would translate literally.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! you are honest, {{as well as}} frank," [...] exclaimed the king. [...] "But that is the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not leave}} my kingdom, as you will readily understand. And that is the <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> never permit strangers to come here, under penalty of death. So long as {{no one knows the}} King of Spor is a monster people will not gossip about my looks, and I am very {{sensitive}} regarding my personal appearance. You will perhaps understand that if I could have chosen I should have been born beautiful instead of ugly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my dear; {{there is}} no <b>reason.</b> If <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{distrust}} him <b>I</b> should not have given so ready an assent to the marriage. But, nevertheless--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So I said, but Henry {{never will}} hear <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not tell you}} of our scene {{yesterday}} over the accounts; he says that we must contract our expenses, or he shall be ruined; so I told him I was {{ready to give up}} the hot-house, or the footman, or the other horse, or anything he would specify; but he would not hear of it--he says it would be fatal to alter our style of living, and that it is all my fault for not being economical! O, Leonard, {{it is very hard to}} give up all one cared for to this housekeeping, and then never to please!' ...|$|E
60|$|There are impulses we can control; {{but there}} are others which control us, because they attain us with a tiger-leap, and are our masters ere we have seen them. Perhaps, though, such impulses are seldom {{altogether}} bad; perhaps Reason, by a process as brief as quiet, a process that is finished ere felt, has ascertained the sanity of the deed Instinct meditates, and feels justified in remaining passive while it is performed. I know I did not <b>reason,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not plan or intend, yet, whereas one moment I was sitting solus on the chair near the table, the next, I held Frances on my knee, placed there with sharpness and decision, and retained with exceeding tenacity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Beauty has {{significance}}, but I {{never knew}} its significance before. I just accepted beauty as something meaningless, {{as something that}} was just beautiful without rhyme or <b>reason.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know anything about beauty. But now I know, or, rather, am just beginning to know. This grass is more beautiful to me now that I know why it is grass, and all the hidden chemistry of sun and rain and earth that makes it become grass. Why, there is romance in the life-history of any grass, yes, and adventure, too. The very thought of it stirs me. When I think of the play of force and matter, and all the tremendous struggle of it, I feel as if I could write an epic on the grass.|$|E
5000|$|Salmacis was a fountain, {{located near}} the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. In {{classical}} times, it had:"the slanderous repute, for what <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know, of making effeminate all who drink from it. It seems that the effeminacy of man is laid {{to the charge of}} the air or of the water; yet it is not these, but rather riches and wanton living, that are the cause of effeminacy."

6000|$|... "You are an ass," [...] I at last {{managed to}} say with cold distinctness. [...] "You are an ass, a coward, a cur, a pitiful thing so low that spittle would be wasted on your face. In such matter Jake Oppenheimer is over-generous with you. As for me, without shame I tell you the only <b>reason</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not spit upon you is that I cannot demean myself nor so degrade my spittle." ...|$|R
2500|$|Alexander {{stepped down}} as Conference Chairman in January 2012, citing his desire to foster consensus. He said, [...] "I {{want to do more}} to make the Senate a more {{effective}} institution so that it can deal better with serious issues." [...] He added, [...] "For these same <b>reasons,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not plan to seek a leadership position in the next Congress", ending speculation that he would run for the position of Republican Whip after Jon Kyl retired in 2013.|$|R
