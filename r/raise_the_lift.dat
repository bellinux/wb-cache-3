50|$|The bridge {{featured}} {{two separate}} movable spans, the central auto-bearing main lift and a retractable bridge for rail traffic near the Kittery shore. When not in use, <b>the</b> rail span <b>lifted</b> up and retracted south atop its own tracks inside the trusswork. <b>The</b> main span <b>lifted</b> on an as-needed basis for ocean-going commercial traffic, {{and on a}} varying set schedule for recreational craft unable to pass beneath the rail span, which was left in an open position by default to accommodate small boats and minimize interruption of auto traffic caused by <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|R

50|$|Oil under {{pressure}} flowed from the hydraulic pump {{to the control}} valve group consisting of three valves in a common housing, manipulated via one large cross-handle and two small hand taps. The large cross-handle regulated <b>the</b> speed of <b>raising</b> or lowering <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> frame. One hand tap selected direction to either <b>raise</b> or lower <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> frame. <b>The</b> second hand tap controlled oil flow to the lowering piston (see below), to begin lowering of <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> frame from its vertical position.|$|R

50|$|With the air flowing inwards, wingtip {{vortices}} and {{the accompanying}} drag are reduced.

50|$|In the 1950s {{with the}} {{development}} of the Eastern shore, it was decided to build a larger bridge; the old Hobart Bridge faced increasing difficulty in managing the larger volumes of traffic that came with development, and constantly <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> span for shipping was disruptive. The total cost of the new bridge in conjunction with approach ramps and Lindisfarne Interchange was in the area of £7 million. Construction commenced in May 1960 and the bridge was first opened to traffic (2 lanes only) on 18 August 1964. The bridge was completed with all four lanes operational on 23 December 1964. It was officially opened on 18 March 1965 by Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. During peak construction a labour force of over 400 men was employed on site.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} a {{morphing}} wing able to adapt itself for different aerodynamic characteristics during flight is were aircraft research is mostly heading to. This investigation looks {{for the development of}} an actuation mechanism using the smart material Nitinol to twist the body of a wing in three different sections. We engineered a concept of this mechanism using bended SMA strips connected from the supporting shaft of a NACA 0015 wing to the lower back side of the wing. Actuation was gained by heating the bended material and obtaining twist angles when the material straightens in austenite form. This twisting alters the aerodynamic properties of <b>the</b> wing, <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> coefficient among other gains. The first section of the wing was able to twist approximately 5. 50 º without being fix to the shaft using only two SMA strips. Further addition of SMA strips would increase the twisting force on the wing...|$|R

50|$|Symmetric spinnakers {{have the}} {{windward}} clew secured to a spinnaker pole. The pole {{is attached to}} the mast and holds the windward edge of the sail in position. Lines that control the spinnaker pole are called guys or braces. The spinnaker pole may be allowed to raise and lower with the force of the wind, or it may have lines attached to it to <b>raise</b> (<b>the</b> topping <b>lift)</b> and lower (<b>the</b> foreguy or downhaul) the angle of the pole. If these lines are used, they are generally set up before setting sail, and left in place even when the spinnaker is stowed.|$|R
40|$|Grain <b>raising,</b> <b>the</b> <b>lifting</b> of fibres {{when water}} {{is applied to}} wood surfaces, is a reason why some {{companies}} are reluctant to finish wood products with water-borne coatings. However, the elements that lift-up and cause grain raising have not been identified, {{and the relationship between}} wood density and grain raising has not been clarified. Our work sought answers to both questions. We planed or sanded different woods using aluminum oxide abrasive paper, and characterized surfaces using profilometry and SEM. Surfaces were re-characterized after wetting and drying. Grain raising is inversely related to wood density. In particular, very low-density woods are highly susceptible to grain raising, whereas grain raising does not occur in high-density woods or planed woods. In low-density woods, sanding tears cell walls creating loosely-bonded slivers of wood that project from surfaces, particularly after wetting and drying. This mechanism for grain raising was confirmed by modelling the action of abrasives on wood cell walls using an array of hollow tubes and a serrated tool. Less commonly, fibres and fibre-bundles project from surfaces. We observed that grain raising was correlated with the coarseness of the abrasive and conclude that it can be reduced in severity by tailoring sanding to account for the density and surface microstructure of wood...|$|R
50|$|Extending {{the wing}} flaps {{increases}} the camber or curvature of <b>the</b> wing, <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> maximum <b>lift</b> coefficient or <b>the</b> upper limit to <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> a wing can generate. This allows the aircraft to generate <b>the</b> required <b>lift</b> {{at a lower}} speed, reducing the stalling speed of the aircraft, and therefore also the minimum speed at which the aircraft will safely maintain flight. The increase in camber also increases the wing drag, which can be beneficial during approach and landing, because it slows the aircraft. In some aircraft configurations, a useful side effect of flap deployment is a decrease in aircraft pitch angle, which lowers the nose thereby improving the pilot's view of the runway over {{the nose of the}} aircraft during landing. In other configurations, however, {{depending on the type of}} flap and the location of the wing, flaps can cause the nose to rise (pitch-up), obscuring the pilot's view of the runway.|$|R
5000|$|Flaps {{are mounted}} on the {{trailing}} edge on the inboard section of each wing (near the wing roots). They are deflected down to increase the effective curvature of <b>the</b> wing. Flaps <b>raise</b> <b>the</b> maximum <b>lift</b> coefficient of <b>the</b> aircraft and therefore reduce its stalling speed. [...] They are used during low speed, high angle of attack flight including take-off and descent for landing. Some aircraft are equipped with [...] "flaperons", which are more commonly called [...] "inboard ailerons". These devices function primarily as ailerons, but on some aircraft, will [...] "droop" [...] when the flaps are deployed, thus acting as both a flap and a roll-control inboard aileron.|$|R

5000|$|Until the bridge's mid-1980s renovation, the {{crossing}} gates blocking the roadway and sidewalks during <b>raising</b> of <b>the</b> upper-deck <b>lift</b> span were manually operated, rotated horizontally across the roadway by two [...] "gate tenders", {{one on each}} side of <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> span.

50|$|Wingsails change camber (the {{asymmetry}} {{between the}} top and the bottom surfaces of the aerofoil), depending on tack, and wind speed. A wingsail becomes more efficient with greater curvature towards on the downwind side. Since the windward side changes with each tack, so must sail curvature change. This happens passively on a conventional sail, as it fills in with wind on each tack. On a wingsail, a change in camber requires a mechanism. Wingsails also change camber to adjust for windspeed. On an aircraft flaps increase the camber or curvature of <b>the</b> wing, <b>raising</b> <b>the</b> maximum <b>lift</b> coefficient—the lift a wing can generate—at a lower speeds of air passing over it. A wingsail has the same need for camber adjustment, as windspeed changes—a straighter camber curvature as windspeed increases, more curved as it decreases.|$|R
5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first completely free flight occurred on 12 November 1959. This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable. The spoilers {{were intended to}} direct the air out over the top or bottom of the annular flap, out the bottom only during hover, but {{over the top and}} bottom during forward flight. The idea was that when the flap was positioned in order to provide control, <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> would be lowered on one side and <b>raised</b> on <b>the</b> other. <b>Lift</b> was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly <b>the</b> <b>lift</b> did not improve on the other, so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of test time in total.|$|R
