This involves a set of highly selective, exothermic reactions which occur under mild conditions; the most successful example is the azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition to form 1,2,3-triazoles.|$|E
50|$|Derivatization of racemic {{compounds}} {{is possible}} with optically pure reagents forming pairs of diastereomers {{which can be}} separated by conventional techniques in physical chemistry. Derivatization is possible by salt formation between an amine and a carboxylic acid. Simple deprotonation affords the pure enantiomer. Examples of chiral derivatizing agents (a.k.a. chiral resolving agents) are tartaric acid and brucine. The method was introduced (again) by Louis Pasteur in 1853 by resolving <b>racemic</b> <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> with optically active (+)-cinchotoxine.|$|E

40|$|Terahertz time-domain-spectroscopy (THz-TDS) {{has emerged}} as a {{versatile}} spectroscopic technique, and an alternative to powder X-ray diffraction in the characterization of molecular crystals. We tested the ability of terahertz spectroscopy to distinguish between chiral and racemic hydrogen-bonded cocrystals that are similar in molecular and supramolecular structure. Terahertz spectroscopy readily distinguished between the isostructural cocrystals of theophylline with chiral and racemic forms of malic acid which are almost identical in molecular structure and supramolecular architecture. Similarly, the cocrystals of theophylline with chiral and <b>racemic</b> forms of <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid,</b> which are similar at the molecular level but dissimilar in crystal packing, were distinguished unequivocally. The investigation of the same cocrystals using X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy suggested that THz-TDS is comparable in sensitivity to diffraction methods and more sensitive than Raman spectroscopy to changes in cocrystal architecture. The differences in spectra acquired by THz-TDS could be further enhanced by cooling the samples to 109 K. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Of 10 {{strains of}} the purple non-sulfur {{bacterium}} Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides, 8 acquired the ability to grow on d-(—) -tartrate; however, growth occurred only after extended lag phases ranging from 2 to 14 days. These lag phases occurred because {{only a small number}} of inoculum cells were able to grow by forming the enzyme d-(—) -tartrate dehydratase [d-(—) -tartrate hydro-lyase; EC number not yet available]. Once cells had grown on d-(—) -tartrate, d-(—) -tartrate dehydratase was formed constitutively. Therefore, mass cultivation of R. sphaeroides for production of large quantities of enzyme was possible on substrates much cheaper than d-(—) -tartrate. When 0. 38 mol of dl-malate was used as a substrate in a chemotrophic fed-batch culture, a final biomass of 15 g (dry weight) liter− 1 and 1, 500 U of d-(—) -tartrate dehydratase liter of culture− 1 were formed.

40|$|Spectroscopic and {{electrochemical}} {{studies were}} carried out to characterize the vanadium(IV) and (V) complexes that form in solution and their interconversions. 51 V NMR spectroscopy coupled with ¹H NMR, 13 C NMR and EPR spectroscopy were used to characterize the vanadium(V) -tartrate complexes that form in the vanadium-tartrate system. The major complex that forms over most of the pH range is a 1 : 1 complex. In addition a minor 1 : 2 complex forms. The 1 : 2 complex formed from enantiomerically pure tartaric acid was less stable than complex formed from <b>racemic</b> <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid.</b> These complexes are different than the 2 : 2 complex that is the major contributor in the vanadium(IV) -tartrate system. The polarographic and cyclic voltammetic investigations of the electrochemical behavior of V(V) in the presence of tartrate demonstrated a complex formation. The diffusion coefficient values of free vanadium ions and vanadium-tartrate complexes were determined. The minimum average values for the diffusion coefficient for the vanadium(IV) -tartrate 2 : 2 complexes were determined to range from 3 ´ 10 - 6 cm² s- 1 to 17 ´ 10 - 6 cm² s- 1 depending on pH...|$|E
40|$|Urolithiasis {{appeared}} in rats maintained {{to study the}} effects of nutrients and methylmercury on development and aging. After a year, the mortality rate was approximately 10 %, and by 2 years, it had increased to nearly 30 %. Clinical signs and urinary tract pathology were examined as a function of diet, duration on diet, gender, methylmercury exposure, genetics, and other potential risk factors by using survival analyses and qualitative comparisons. Urolithiasis in female rats appeared 15 weeks after beginning a purified diet and after 5 weeks for male rats. After 97 weeks, the mortality rate of female rats was 22 % and for male rats was 64 %. Lifetime urolithiasis-associated mortality was about 2 % in a group of rats that consumed the contaminated diet for < 30 weeks. No urolithiasis occurred in siblings or cohorts of the rats described here but which were maintained on a standard rodent chow containing choline chloride. Urolithiasis was traced to racemic, rather than levo-, bitartaric acid in some purified diets shipped in 2001 and 2002. It is unknown when the impurity first {{appeared in}} the diet, so estimates of exposure duration are upper limits. Chronic methylmercury exposure increased vulnerability. Some families (dam + offspring) had multiple cases of urolithiasis, but probability models constructed to evaluate familial clustering revealed no evidence for a genetic predisposition to urolithiasis, apart from gender. Removing <b>racemic</b> <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> did not decrease mortality once rats had been on the diet for 20 to 30 weeks, but it helped when exposure duration was shorter.

50|$|In 1840, Germain Hess {{proposed}} Hess's law, {{an early}} {{statement of the}} law of conservation of energy, which establishes that energy changes in a chemical process depend only on the states of the starting and product materials and not on the specific pathway taken between the two states. In 1847, Hermann Kolbe obtained acetic acid from completely inorganic sources, further disproving vitalism. In 1848, William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin (commonly known as Lord Kelvin) established the concept of absolute zero, the temperature at which all molecular motion ceases. In 1849, Louis Pasteur discovered that the <b>racemic</b> form of <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> is a mixture of the levorotatory and dextrotatory forms, thus clarifying the nature of optical rotation and advancing the field of stereochemistry. In 1852, August Beer proposed Beer's law, which explains the relationship between the composition of a mixture and the amount of light it will absorb. Based partly on earlier work by Pierre Bouguer and Johann Heinrich Lambert, it established the analytical technique known as spectrophotometry. In 1855, Benjamin Silliman, Jr. pioneered methods of petroleum cracking, which made the entire modern petrochemical industry possible.|$|R

40|$|Grapevines contain many {{different}} organic acids {{and the two}} most abundant are <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> and malic acid. Malic <b>acid</b> and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> both increase in concentration up until veraison then after veraison malic acid is broken down as sugar increases. Malic acid has been studied {{in a variety of}} fruits for it is a very common <b>acid.</b> However <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> is an uncommon primary acid in fruits and very little is known about its synthesis in grapevine. However, <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> is important in providing a low pH which is important for the prevention of microbial spoilage during the winemaking process. A high pH of juice means that more <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> will need to be added in the winery increasing the cost to wine makers. By discovering more about the genes involved in the synthesis of malic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> and the breakdown of malic acid this knowledge could be used to breed vines with higher acid concentrations. L-Idonate dehydrogenase (L-IDH) is one of only two genes known to participate in the <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis pathway. Since its initial characterisation two more isoforms have been annotated in the grapevine genome based on sequence similarity. The characterisation of these isoforms was undertaken using a variety of techniques including expression of the proteins in E. coli and in vitro protein activity assays and also in planta expression in the microvine with the creation of transgenic microvines. To try and discover regions of the genome that might be involved in acid metabolism in grapevine berries, malic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations were measured from four progeny populations. The individuals of these populations were then sequenced using a genotyping by sequencing method to find SNPs markers for a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). This GWAS was then verified with genetic mapping and QTL analysis. During the process of measuring acid from these progeny populations the question of variability in acid concentration between berries from the same vine arose. A preliminary study into this variability was conducted to determine the variability of malic and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> in berries both within a bunch and between bunches from the same vine. This data was then used to predict the error in sampling subsets of berries of different sizes. <b>Tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration in tissues other than the berry was also explored. Acid concentration was measured in several tissues including root, shoots and leaves. It was found that <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> was present in these tissues with varying concentrations. <b>Tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration in leaves was then studied further try see if there was a link between the age of the leaf and <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration and also between leaf <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration and berry <b>tartaric</b> <b>acid</b> concentration.
