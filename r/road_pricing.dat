5|$|Councils {{from across}} the West Midlands in the United Kingdom, {{including}} Birmingham and Coventry, rejected the idea of imposing congestion pricing schemes on the area in 2008, despite promises from central government of transport project funding {{in exchange for the}} implementation of a <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> pilot scheme.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of surcharging users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the congestion pricing concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E

5|$|This pricing {{mechanism}} {{has been}} used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods, as a means to better manage the demand for the service, and whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand, or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service. Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities, metros, railways and autobus services, and has been proposed for charging internet access. It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports, waterways, airports and <b>road</b> <b>pricing,</b> though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy, particularly for urban roads, such as undesirable distribution effects, the disposition of the revenues raised, and the social and political acceptability of the congestion charge.|$|E

5|$|The first {{implementation}} {{of such a}} scheme was Singapore Area Licensing Scheme in 1975, together with a comprehensive package of <b>road</b> <b>pricing</b> measures, stringent car ownership rules and improvements in mass transit. Thanks to technological advances in electronic toll collection, electronic detection, and video surveillance technology, collecting congestion fees has become easier. Singapore upgraded its system in 1998, and similar pricing schemes were implemented in Rome in 2001, London in 2003 with extensions in 2007; Stockholm in 2006, as a seven-month trial, and then on a permanent basis. In January 2008 Milan began a one-year trial program called Ecopass, charging low emission standard vehicles and exempting cleaner and alternative fuel vehicles. The Ecopass program was extended until December 31, 2011, and on January 16, 2012 was replaced by Area C, a trial program that converted the scheme from a pollution-charge to a congestion charge. The Gothenburg congestion tax was implemented in January 2013 and it was modeled after the Stockholm scheme.|$|E

The theory research and practice of <b>road</b> congestion <b>pricing</b> revenue redistribution indicate that policy suggestions and corresponding methods of implementation of this strategy should be presented aiming at resolving the unfair problem of welfare redistribution and enlisting support of public based on the consideration of traffic efficiency firstly.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the <b>road</b> toll <b>pricing</b> and capacity investment {{problem in a}} congested road network in a multicriteria decisionmaking framework. A goal programming approach is used in which the following four major goals are considered: (1) cost recovery, (2) service level, (3) environmental, and (4) equity. The multiobjective <b>road</b> toll <b>pricing</b> and capacity investment problem is formulated as a bilevel goal programming model. The upper level of the model aims to minimize the deviations from stated goals for a given priority ranking of the goals, while the lower level is the road users' route choice equilibrium problem. A simulated annealing-based solution algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model. Numerical {{results show that the}} priority structure of the goals can significantly affect the <b>road</b> toll <b>pricing</b> and capacity investment decisions. The simulated annealing-based solution algorithm outperforms the sensitivity analysis-based solution algorithm in terms of solution quality. The proposed methodology provides an avenue for understanding the trade-offs among conflicting objectives and for designing a financially and environmentally sustainable transportation system.

In this time window, our experiments showed that our approach is useful as more drivers were able to complete their trips compared to the fixed pricing approach. Even without an explicit coordination mechanism among the link managers, a global performance improvement was observed in the road network. Moreover, with our approach, drivers’ costs remained close to the costs obtained with fixed pricing, and a higher variability on the drivers’ preference yielded better performance for the drivers.|$|R
