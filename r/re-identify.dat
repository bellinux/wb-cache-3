500|$|The {{music was}} handled {{by a team}} from sound company Basiscape, {{composed}} of multiple composers who had worked on Odin Sphere. Sakimoto acted as sound producer, the sound director was Masaaki Kaneko, and the music was composed by Sakimoto, Yoshimi Kudo, Noriyuki Kamikura, Mitsuhiro Kaneda, Kimihiro Abe, Azusa Chiba and Masaharu Iwata. Sakimoto was working on music for Odin Sphere when the project was first proposed, and thought Kamitani was being overambitious working on a premise based in Japan when developing a game based on European mythology. During the initial planning stage, Sakimoto thought the game would be a [...] "mock-Japanese" [...] project, with Japanese instruments inserted into techno music. Once he realized how sincere Kamitani was with the project, Sakimoto and the team needed to <b>re-identify</b> with the roots of traditional Japanese music. For Sakimoto, his approach was to reconnect with how earlier Japanese people turned their wabi-sabi philosophy and worldview into words and music: he carried over this approach into the project. Each of the composers {{had to go through}} similar experiences.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a least-costly experiment design framework for closed-loop performance diagnosis using prediction error identification. The performance diagnosis methodology consists in verifying whether an identified {{model of the}} true system lies in a performance-related region of interest. The experiment design framework minimizes the overall excitation cost incurred for detecting {{the cause of the}} performance drop and <b>re-identifying</b> the system dynamics when the degraded performance is due to control-relevant system changes. The optimal design of excitation signals is performed for a desired detection rate and a pre-specified level of accuracy required for the <b>re-identified</b> model...|$|R
50|$|De-anonymization (also spelled as deanonymization) is a {{strategy}} in data mining in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other sources of data to <b>re-identify</b> the anonymous data source. The term became popular in 2006 when Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov entered a contest hosted by Netflix, and applied their de-anonymization techniques to successfully identify Netflix data {{for a number of}} specific members.|$|E
50|$|The {{term was}} {{introduced}} by Tore Dalenius in 1986. Since then, quasi-identifiers have been the basis of several attacks on released data. For instance, Sweeney linked health records to publicly available information to locate the then-governor of Massachusetts' hospital records using uniquely-identifying quasi-identifiers, and Sweeney, Abu and Winn used public voter records to <b>re-identify</b> participants in the Personal Genome Project. Additionally, Arvind Narayanan and Vitaly Shmatikov made use of quasi-identifiers to de-anonymize data released by Netflix.|$|E
5000|$|The Federal Statistical Office {{refers to}} the {{so-called}} prohibition prohibition, which excludes {{the transfer of the}} collected data to other authorities, and the earliest possible deletion of charac- teristics such as names and addresses. These measures are not sufficient for data protectionists. Even after a distance of personal data from the database, they can <b>re-identify</b> themselves from the [...] "anonymous" [...] data using computers and information from other sources. A true anonymisation is thus not given.|$|E

50|$|Many {{smartphones}} for wireless LANs remember {{they are}} already connected, and this mechanism prevents the user from having to <b>re-identify</b> with each connection. However, an attacker could create a WIFI access point twin with the same parameters and characteristics as the real network. Using {{the fact that some}} smartphones remember the networks, they could confuse the two networks and connect to the network of the attacker who can intercept data if it does not transmit its data in encrypted form.|$|E
5000|$|The wide {{principle}} of European Data Protection establish a good definition. In there e.g. even [...] "anonymized" [...] data are still personal data if data {{are derived from}} personal data outside {{the control of the}} individual citizen in question or any means to <b>re-identify</b> or recognize citizens or citizen devices exist. Also, since the sources still exist so derived data will enrich personal data (create more personal data that did not exist before) and inside reversal of [...] "anonymity" [...] through any of a range of means is mostly trivial, e.g. the [...] "anonymization" [...] process can be rerun adding an identifier.|$|E
50|$|Deanonymisation is a {{strategy}} in data mining in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other sources of data to <b>re-identify</b> the anonymous data source. Along with transaction graph analysis, which may reveal connections between bitcoin addresses (pseudonyms), there is a possible attack which links a user's pseudonym to its IP address. If the peer is using Tor, the attack includes a method to separate the peer from the Tor network, forcing them to use their real IP address for any further transactions. The attack makes use of bitcoin mechanisms of relaying peer addresses and anti-DoS protection. The cost {{of the attack on}} the full bitcoin network is under €1500 per month.|$|E

5000|$|While a {{complete}} ban on re-identification has been urged, {{the enforcement of}} this is impossible. However, there are ways for lawmakers to combat and punish re-identification efforts, if {{and when they are}} exposed:pair a ban with harsher penalties and stronger enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, grant victims of re-identification a right of action against those who <b>re-identify</b> them, mandate software audit trails for people who utilize and analyze anonymized data. A small-scale re-identification ban may also be imposed on trusted recipients of particular databases, such as government data miners. This ban would be much easier to enforce and may discourage re-identification in other spheres and in the future.|$|E
5000|$|In this mid-to-late 1990s {{series of}} sketches, Lionel Osbourne (played by Tim Meadows) hosts a {{television}} show primarily dealing with African-American issues. However, the show is only broadcast to fulfill WNBC-TV's public service commitment, and airs very early on Sunday morning. Osbourne is generally clueless to {{the accomplishments of the}} guests on his show, regularly asking them stupid questions. Also, Osbourne pauses after nearly every dialogue sequence with his guest to announce the time and to <b>re-identify</b> the show, which would always follow the format: [...] "It's (time) in the A.M. and you're watching Perspectives. I'm your host, Lionel Osbourne. With me today is (guest).", followed by a gradually less informative recap of the conversation so far. Debuted January 21, 1995.|$|E
50|$|Datafly {{algorithm}} is an algorithm for providing anonymity in medical data. The algorithm {{was developed by}} Latanya Arvette Sweeney in 1997&minus;98. Anonymization is achieved by automatically generalizing, substituting, inserting, and removing information as appropriate without losing many of the details found within the data. The method can be used on-the-fly in role-based security within an institution, and in batch mode for exporting data from an institution.Organizations release and receive medical data with all explicit identifiers -- such as name -- removed, in the erroneous belief that patient confidentiality is maintained because the resulting data look anonymous. However the remaining data {{can be used to}} <b>re-identify</b> individuals by linking or matching the data to other databases or by looking at unique characteristics found in the fields and records of the database itself.|$|E

5000|$|In 1982 the PRC {{constitution}} was amended {{to redefine the}} People's Republic of China as a [...] "unitary multinational state built up jointly {{by the people of}} all its nationalities" [...] (中华人民共和国是全国各族人民共同缔造的统一的多民族国家). Inspired by such concepts, in the 1990s some Chinese historians such as Sun Jinji 孫進己 and Zhang Boquan 張博泉 began to <b>re-identify</b> Goguryeo, especially the first half of Goguryeo's history before it moved its capital to the Korean peninsula, as part of the history of China rather than Korea. As early as 1993, the leader of a North Korean delegation attending a historical conference on Goguryeo in China accused Chinese historians of understanding ancient China as coterminous with the PRC, a view he claimed was not backed up by historical evidence. In 2002, this effort has been taken up by the PRC government {{in the form of the}} Northeast Project.|$|E
5000|$|Two {{researchers}} at the University of Texas, Arvind Narayanan and Professor Vitaly Shmatikov, were able to re-identity some portion of anonymized Netflix movie-ranking data with individual consumers on the streaming website.  The data was released by Netflix 2006 after de-identification, which consisted of replacing individual names with random numbers and moving around personal details. The two researchers de-anonymized some of the data by comparing it with non-anonymous IMDb (Internet Movie Database) users’ movie ratings. Very little information from the database, it was found, was needed to identify the subscriber. [...] In the resulting research paper, there were startling reveletions of {{how easy it is}} to <b>re-identify</b> Netflix users. For example, simply knowing data about only two movies a user has reviewed, including the precise rating and the date of rating give or take three days allows for 68% re-identification success.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Khrushchev regime {{escalated}} anti-Islamic propaganda. Then, {{on several occasions}} in the 1970s and 1980s, the Kremlin leadership called for renewed efforts to combat religion, including Islam. Typically, such campaigns included conversion of mosques to secular use; attempts to <b>re-identify</b> traditional Islamic-linked customs with nationalism rather than religion; and propaganda linking Islam to backwardness, superstition, and bigotry. Official hostility toward Islam grew in 1979 with Soviet military involvement in nearby Afghanistan and the increasing assertiveness of Islamic revivalists in several countries. From that time through the early post-Soviet era, some officials in Moscow and in Tajikistan warned of an extremist Islamic menace, often {{on the basis of}} limited or distorted evidence. Despite all these efforts, Islam remained {{an important part of the}} identity of the Tajiks and other Muslim peoples of Tajikistan through the end of the Soviet era and the first years of independence.|$|E
