60|$|At last all was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>anchor</b> {{the great}} buoy, and {{preparations}} were in progress for this important event, when everybody {{was startled by}} a shout from Mr. Marcy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{you been}} {{down the river}} before? That's Gravesend. I see the captain is getting <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>anchor.</b> So, I suppose the tide has nearly run out. If this wind holds, we shall be fairly out at sea {{when you get up}} tomorrow.|$|E
60|$|It was my duty {{to sound}} the pumps, but this I did not deem necessary. No sooner were the dollars secure, or, rather, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>anchor</b> me {{in the bottom of}} the ocean, than I remembered the captain. He was asleep, and waking him up, I told him what had happened. The old man, a dry, drawling, cool, down-easter, laughed in my face for my pains, telling me I had seen one of the sheeting-boards, with which he had had the bottom of the {{schooner}} covered, to protect it from the worms, at Campeachy, and that I need be under no concern about the schooner's bottom. This was the simple truth, and I cast off the dollars, again, with a sneaking consciousness of not having done my duty. I suppose all men have moments when they are not exactly themselves, in which they act very differently from what it has been their practice to act. On this occasion, I was not alarmed for myself, but I thought the course I took was necessary to save that dross which lures so many to perdition. Avarice blinded me to the secrets of my own trade.|$|E
60|$|Smoke {{was rising}} from the cabins of the {{different}} sloops, denoting {{that they were all}} bent on getting the first meal of the day. So far as the Dazzler was concerned, it was a simple matter, and soon they were putting a single reef in the mainsail and getting <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> weigh <b>anchor.</b>|$|R
60|$|However, it {{had been}} finally fixed that a boat should put in to the Abbey steps to receive the fleeces of the sheep-shearing of the home grange, and that, rolled {{in one of these}} fleeces, the wounded knight should be brought on board the Vrow Gudule, where Groot and the women would await him, their freight being already embarked, and all <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> weigh <b>anchor.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, as for bein' timid," [...] {{said the}} porter, rubbing {{the end of}} his nose, which was copper-coloured and knotty, [...] "I don't think I ever knowed that there feelin', but it does take a feller aback to be told all of a suddent, after he's reg'larly laid up in port, <b>to</b> get <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> trip <b>anchor</b> in twelve hours and bear away over the North Sea--not that I cares a brass fardin' for that fish-pond, blow high, blow low, but it's raither suddent, d'ye see, and my rig ain't just seaworthy." ...|$|R
6000|$|When I got {{on board}} the South-Amboy boat, I found a party of Indians there, going to head-quarters, like myself. The sight of these chaps set up all my rigging, and I felt ripe for fun. I treated them to a breakfast each, and gave them as much to drink as they could swallow. We all got merry, and had our own coarse fun, in the usual thought less manner of seamen. This was a bad beginning, {{and by the time}} we reached a tavern, I was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>anchor.</b> Where this was, is more than I know; for I was not in a state to keep a ship's reckoning. Whether any of my money was stolen or not, I cannot say, but I know that some of my clothes were. Next day I got to Philadelphia, where I had another frolic. After this, I went on to Washington, keeping it up, the whole distance. I fell in with a soldier chap, who was out of cash, and who was going to Washington to get a pension, too; and so we lived in common. When we reached Washington, my cash was diminished to three dollars and a half, and all was the {{consequences}} of brandy and folly. I had actually spent forty-six dollars and a half, in a journey that might have been made with ten, respectably! ...|$|E
5000|$|Anchored in the {{vicinity}} of Bay of Rest, Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia, William B. Preston continued her operations as a seaplane tender through early July, attached to Patrol Wing 10 and servicing two PBY-5 planes. One plane conducted a daily patrol as far as Broome, while the other remained at a buoy near the ship with her crew living on board the tender. The ship's log noted that she was [...] "in all respects <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> slip <b>anchor</b> and get underway instantlyâ€”-day or night." [...] The calm waters of the bay and the generally perfect flying weather combined to greatly facilitate flight operations.|$|R
6000|$|The {{evening before}} he was to sail for the Downs, where the Middlesex lay <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> weigh <b>anchor,</b> the new {{lieutenant}} was summoned by Winter to attend him to the General's residence, {{for the purpose of}} being introduced to his patron, to thank him at once, and to bid him farewell. On the road, the old man took the liberty of schooling his companion concerning the respect which he ought to pay to his master, [...] "who was, though a kind and generous man as ever came from Northumberland, extremely rigid in punctiliously exacting the degree of honour which was his due." ...|$|R
6000|$|Percyra had {{yet another}} thing which troubled him, {{concerning}} the voyage which Father Xavier {{had to make}} before that of China. The season being already far spent, he feared there were no vessels at Malacca, which were bound for Goa. He could not carry the Father to Cochin himself, because he was obliged {{to go on to}} Sunda, there to unlade his merchandize; but that apprehension was soon at an end, for Xavier, illuminated from heaven, told him positively, [...] "That the ship of Antonio Pereyra was in the port of Malacca, and that they should find it just <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> weigh <b>anchor,</b> and set sail for Cochin." ...|$|R
25|$|Orders for {{the fleet}} at Tynemouth were given on 28 April. All the ships were <b>to</b> be <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> weigh <b>anchor</b> at a {{favourable}} wind. The Lord Admiral, Viscount Lisle's flagship would fly the St George Cross on the fore-top mast and two top-lights at night. The ships of the 'vaward', the vanguard, would follow and anchor {{as near as}} possible. Hertford and the treasure-ship (Ralph Sadler was treasurer) would follow with his ensign on the main-top mast of the Rose Lion with two night lights on the shrouds. The Earl of Shrewsbury, captain of the rear-ward would fly the ensign on his mizzen mast, with a cresset light in the poop deck at night. The other ships were not to show flags or lights. Any ship that was transporting base or double base guns was to mount them on the fore-deck for the landing.|$|R
60|$|It is {{said that}} Kidd showed no repentance when he was tried, but insisted {{that he was the}} victim of {{malicious}} persons who swore falsely against him. And yet a more thoroughly dishonest rascal never sailed under the black flag. In the guise of an accredited officer of the government, he committed the crimes he was sent out to suppress; he deceived his men; he robbed and misused his fellow-countrymen and his friends, and he even descended to the meanness of cheating and despoiling the natives of the West India Islands, with whom he traded. These people were in the habit of supplying pirates with food and other necessaries, and they always found their rough customers entirely honest, and willing to pay for what they received; for as the pirates made a practice of stopping at certain points for supplies, they wished, of course, to be on good terms with those who furnished them. But Kidd had no ideas of honor toward people of high or low degree. He would trade with the natives as if he intended to treat them fairly and pay for all he got; but when the time came for him to depart, and he was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> weigh <b>anchor,</b> he would seize upon all the commodities he could lay his hands upon, and without paying a copper to the distressed and indignant Indians, he would gayly sail away, his black flag flaunting derisively in the wind.|$|R
60|$|Anger {{departed}} by night, {{attended by}} two servants. Being {{arrived at the}} port, and enquiring for Ferdinand Alvarez, he lighted accidentally on George Alvarez, who was just <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> weigh <b>anchor.</b> This George was a wealthy merchant, a man of probity, and who had an extreme affection for the Father. He received the letters of Alvarez {{as if they had}} been addressed to himself, took the three Japonians into his ship, entertained them with all kindness, and brought them to Malacca; taking great satisfaction in the good office he should do in presenting them to the man of God, who might, perhaps, make them the first Christians of their country. But the misfortune was, that they missed the Father, who was just gone for the Moluccas. Anger, more disquieted in a foreign land than he had been at home, and despairing of ever seeing him, whom he had so often heard of from his friends, had it in his thoughts to have returned to Japan, without considering the danger to which he exposed himself, and almost forgetting the murder which had caused his flight, according to the custom of criminals, who blind themselves in those occasions, and whom divine justice oftentimes brings back to the same place where they had committed their offence. Whereupon, he went again to sea, and having made some little stay in a port of China, he pursued his voyage. Already some Japonian islands were in sight, when there arose a furious tempest, which endangered the sinking of the ship, and which in four days brought him back into the same port of China, from whence he had set out. This was to Anger a favourable effect of God's providence; for the same hand which drives the guilty to the precipice, sometimes preserves them from falling into it, and pulls them back, after a miraculous manner.|$|R

60|$|Not uninfluenced by the {{peculiar}} good-humor at present prevailing, {{and for the}} time oblivious of any but benevolent thoughts, Captain Delano, who, from recent indications, counted upon a breeze within {{an hour or two}} at furthest, dispatched the boat back to the sealer, with orders for all the hands that could be spared immediately to set about rafting casks to the watering-place and filling them. Likewise he bade word be carried to his chief officer, that if, against present expectation, the ship was not brought <b>to</b> <b>anchor</b> by sunset, he need be under no concern; for as there was to be a full moon that night, he (Captain Delano) would remain on board <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> play the pilot, come the wind soon or late.|$|R
