50|$|After the {{discovery}} of parity non-conservation (see History), it was found that, in beta decay, electrons are emitted mostly with negative helicity, i.e., they move, naively speaking, like left-handed screws driven into a material (they have negative longitudinal polarization). Conversely, positrons have mostly positive helicity, i.e., they move like <b>right-handed</b> <b>screws.</b> Neutrinos (emitted in positron decay) have positive helicity, while antineutrinos (emitted in electron decay) have negative helicity.|$|R
40|$|In {{earliest}} cosmic {{history the}} university started with matter {{and not with}} antimatter. Shortly after the beginning the electroweak interaction prominent in nuclear beta decay - acted as a lefthander. Much later, in prebiotic evolution, optically left-handed amino acids determined the unique signature of following terrestrial organic life. Again ae- ons later, homo sapiens appears as predominantly right handed and creates cultures with many broken symmetries. Along these pathways of history it was essential that choices were made - left or right, matter or antimatter but on several instances it seemed less relevant which choices were made. We think that biochirality occurred by global chance; perhaps by local necessity, but without causal links to the PCT theorem. In other cases - e. g. the standardization to <b>right-handed</b> <b>screws</b> - the choice will {{have been made by}} causal necessity...|$|R

5000|$|The {{majority}} of screws are tightened by clockwise rotation, which is termed a right-hand thread; a common mnemonic device for remembering this {{when working with}} screws or bolts is [...] "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey." [...] Another rule is this: curl the fingers of your right hand around the screw with your thumb pointing is the direction you want the screw to go. If the <b>screw</b> is <b>right-handed</b> (most <b>screws</b> are) and you turn the screw {{in the direction of}} your fingers the screw will move in the direction of your thumb. Screws with left-hand threads are used in exceptional cases. For example, when the screw will be subject to counterclockwise torque (which would work to undo a right-hand thread), a left-hand-threaded screw would be an appropriate choice. The left side pedal of a bicycle has a left-hand thread.|$|R
40|$|The vector or {{cross product}} of two vectors is defined as- [Equation] where q AB is the angle {{between the two}} vectors and A and B are their magnitudes. Notice that r C is a vector with the {{direction}} of the unit vector, perpendicular to the plane of A and B. The direction of the cross product can be obtained as follows- rotate a <b>right-handed</b> (standard) <b>screw</b> such that it rotates from the vector r A to the vector r B through the smaller of the two angles between them. The screw will then drive in {{the direction of the}} cross product vector. Equivalently, if you curl the fingers of your right hand in the direction from r A to r B through the smaller of the angles between the vectors, your thumb will point {{in the direction of the}} vector product. Another variation of the right hand rule for vector cross product is illustrated in Figure 1 - Using the fingers on your right hand, if the index finger points in the direction of vector r A and your middle finger points in the direction of vector r B, then the thumb will point in the direction of the cross product r C. When the angle between the two vectors is either 0 ? or 180 ?, the cross product is zero. When the angle between the two vectors is 90 ?, the magnitude of the cross product is the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors. The cross product of two vectors is shown in the video as one of the two vectors rotates around the origin while the other remains fixed. Examples of the cross product in physics include torque and the magnetic force on a moving charged particle...|$|R
50|$|The threads on a <b>{{right-handed}}</b> <b>screw</b> are a right-handed helix. They {{are basically}} a long inclined plane {{wrapped around a}} cylinder such that turning the screw advances the screw back and forth along the z-axis. From {{the point of view}} of the external threads, turning the screw forces the screw up or down the inclined plane. If a screw is right-handed (most screws are) the rule is this: point your right thumb in the direction you want the screw to go and turn the screw in the direction of your curled right fingers.|$|E
5000|$|By common convention, right-{{handedness}} is {{the default}} handedness for screw threads. [...] Therefore, most threaded parts and fasteners have right-handed threads. One {{explanation for why}} right-handed threads became standard is that for a right-handed person, tightening a <b>right-handed</b> <b>screw</b> with a screwdriver is easier than tightening a left-handed screw, because it uses the stronger supinator muscle of the arm rather than the weaker pronator muscle. [...] Since most people are right-handed, right-handed threads became standard on threaded fasteners. Left-handed screw threads are used in some machines and in these applications: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{geometry}} of nonreciprocal propagation may at first appear paradoxical. In an optically active medium, the polarization direction twists {{in the same}} sense (e.g. like a <b>right-handed</b> <b>screw)</b> during the forward and backward passes, whereas in a Faraday medium, because the light reverses its propagation direction with respect to the magnetic field, the helicity of the propagation also reverses. But because the propagation axis has also reversed, this reversal of helicity is just what is needed to cause the back-reflected light to have different polarization from the incident light. If the Faraday medium is of such thickness as to cause a 45 degree rotation on the way in, the back-reflected beam will have polarization perpendicular to the incident beam, allowing it to be cleanly blocked by the light source's polarizer.|$|E

5000|$|Optical {{activity}} occurs due to molecules {{dissolved in}} a fluid or {{due to the}} fluid itself only if the molecules are one of two (or more) stereoisomers; {{this is known as}} an enantiomer. The structure of such a molecule is such that it is not identical to its mirror image (which would be that of a different stereoisomer, or the [...] "opposite enantiomer"). In mathematics, this property is also known as chirality. For instance, a metal rod is not chiral, since its appearance in a mirror is not distinct from itself. However a screw or light bulb base (or any sort of helix) is chiral; an ordinary <b>right-handed</b> <b>screw</b> thread, viewed in a mirror, would appear as a left-handed screw (very uncommon) which could not possibly screw into an ordinary (right-handed) nut. A human viewed in a mirror would have their heart on the right side, clear evidence of chirality, whereas the mirror reflection of a doll might well be indistinguishable from the doll itself.|$|E

40|$|AbstractStalk {{contraction}} and zooid {{contraction of}} living Vorticella convallaria were studied by high-speed video cinematography. Contraction was monitored {{at a speed}} of 9000 frames per second to study the contractile process in detail. Complete stalk contraction required approximately 9 ms. The maximal contraction velocity, 8. 8 cm/s, was observed 2 ms {{after the start of}} contraction. We found that a twist appeared in the zooid during contraction. As this twist unwound, the zooid began to rotate like a <b>right-handed</b> <b>screw.</b> The subsequent stalk contraction steps, the behavior of which was similar to that of a damped harmonic oscillator, were analyzed by means of the equation of motion. From the beginning of stalk contraction, the Hookean force constant increased, and reached an upper limit of 2. 23 × 10 − 4 N/m 2 – 3 ms after the start of contraction. Thus, within 2 ms, the contraction signal spread to the entire stalk, allowing the stalk to generate the full force of contraction. The tension of an extended stalk was estimated to be 5. 58 × 10 − 8 N from the Hookean force constant of a stalk. This value coincides with that of the isometric tension of a glycerol-treated V. convallaria, confirming that the contractile system of V. convallaria is well preserved despite glycerol treatment...|$|E

In the crystal 1 exists as two enantiomers, which {{are determined by the}} left- or <b>right-handed</b> <b>screw</b> axis of the cdt ligand. The cdt ligand in 1 resists most typical displacement reactions but 1 reacts with CO at - 78 -degrees-C to afford the colorless 18 e complex (t Bu 2 PC 2 H 4 P t Bu 2) Ni(CO) 2 (2). From the reaction of Ni(cod) 2 with t Bu 2 PC 2 H 4 P t Bu 2 yellow needles of (t Bu 2 PC 2 H 4 P t Bu 2) Ni(η 2 -cod) (3) are obtained. Low temperature NMR spectroscopy established that only one diene C=C bond is coordinated to nickel(0). At higher temperatures a rapid exchange of the coordinated and unbound C=C bonds is induced. When solutions of 3 are kept at 20 -degrees-C for several days the dinuclear, almost insoluble yellow complex {(t Bu 2 PC 2 H 4 P t Bu 2) Ni} 2 (µ-η 2,η 2 -cod) (4) precipitates. The reaction of Ni(C 2 H 4) 3 and t Bu 2 PC 2 H 4 P t Bu 2 affords orange (t Bu 2 PC 2 H 4 P t Bu 2) Ni(C 2 H 4) (5).

As for 3, only one diene C=C bond is coordinated to nickel(0), but the structure is fluxional with exchange of the coordinated and unbound C=C bonds (NMR at 20 -degrees-C). From a solution of 6 in pentane the dinuclear, diastereomeric compounds rac/meso-{(t Bu 2 PC 2 H 4 P t Bu 2) Ni} 2 (µ-η 2,η 2 -C 6 H 10) (7 a, b) separate in large yellow crystals. In similar reactions the 1, 6 -heptadiene complexes (t Bu 2 PC 2 H 4 P t Bu 2) Ni(η 2 -C 7 H 12) (8) and rac/meso-{(t Bu 2 PC 2 H 4 P t Bu 2) Ni} 2 (µ-η 2,η 2 -C 7 H 12) (9 a,b) are also obtained.
