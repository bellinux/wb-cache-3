50|$|The typical MORGOIL tapered {{neck bearing}} {{assembly}} {{consists of a}} sleeve with a non-locking tapered bore that facilitates removal of the bearing chock assembly from the <b>roll</b> <b>neck.</b> The sleeve, keyed to the neck to prevent creeping during operation, produces a slight interference fit on the <b>roll</b> <b>neck</b> {{by means of the}} push-up force used to mount the bearing on the roll. The outside diameter of the sleeve is ground and polished serving as the journal surface of the bearing. Sleeve wall thickness variation is controlled to 0.005 mm (0.0002 in.) to minimize roll force variation.|$|E
50|$|These {{principal}} {{bearing components}} are assembled in a Chock with a Sleeve Ring, Chock End Plate, End Cover and inboard sealing arrangement. The assembly is secured to the <b>roll</b> <b>neck</b> by a Locking arrangement.|$|E
50|$|While most {{focus in}} the bearing is on the load {{carrying}} components, locking is equally as important since these components must be held securely on the <b>roll</b> <b>neck.</b> HB (hydraulic bayonet) locking was introduced in 1980 provides safe and repeatable performance. Later locking concepts such as the RM (removable mount) and CB (compact bayonet) have been more recently introduced, but they all share hydraulic mount and dismount functions.|$|E

5000|$|As {{the demands}} for rolled steel {{products}} developed, the speeds and loads of the mills increased, {{and the problem of}} adequate roll bearings became more and more acute.First introduced in 1932, MORGOIL bearings were welcomed by the rolling mill industry where <b>roll</b> <b>neck</b> bearing problems were hampering the development of faster and more powerful rolling mills. MORGOIL Bearings provided higher load capacities, higher speed capabilities, lower power consumption, and longer life then existing bearing choices ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, the {{precursor}} to the late 1960s hippies and 2010s hipster subculture emerged in Bohemian parts of London, Paris and the urban US. Black <b>roll</b> <b>neck</b> sweaters, sandals, sunglasses, striped shirts, horn rimmed glasses, and berets were popular among Beatniks of both sexes, and men often wore beards. The Russian equivalent of the Beatnik, known as Stilyagi (style hunters), wore thick soled shoes, brightly colored socks, and exaggerated American style clothing in imitation of Western film actors and modern jazz musicians.|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} {{parts of}} a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy steel forging, heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking tapered bore, which fits on, and is keyed to, the tapered <b>Roll</b> <b>Neck,</b> thus becoming the bearing journal. Surrounding the Sleeve is the Bushing, fixed in the Chock, which carries the radial load. The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is the Thrust Bearing, which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications {{depending on the size}} of the radial bearing). The Thrust Bearing is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the thrust load and is not subject to any radial loading.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the late}} 18th century, {{merchant}} seamen and dockworkers have worn denim flared trousers, striped undershirts, knitted <b>roll</b> <b>neck</b> jumpers, and short blue peacoats. This basic outfit, {{paired with a}} thick leather belt, flat cap and clogs, was also a mark of identification for {{turn of the century}} criminal gangs such as the Scuttlers.On the more luxurious cruise ships and ocean liners, deckhands wore neatly pressed dress blues {{similar to those of the}} Royal Navy and USN, while waiters and cabin stewards wore white uniforms with a band collar, gilded brass buttons, and a gold stripe on the trouser leg. In wet weather, sailors wore oilskins and Souwesters, but contemporary fishermen generally wear a two piece yellow or orange waterproof jacket and trousers. Modern updates to the traditional look include polar fleeces, hoodies, baseball caps, and knit caps. Straw hats, sailor caps and tarred waterproof hats are no longer in widespread civilian use, but wool or denim versions of the Greek fisherman's cap remain common.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} three-segment loop-like damage of sleeve under rolling load case, to quantitatively analyze bearing failure mechanism, a {{mathematical}} model of oil-film bearing for producing the 3 -D contact pressure and shear stress distribution between sleeve and <b>roll</b> <b>neck</b> was developed by 3 D elastic contact boundary element method. Some programs for automatically creating 3 -D surface grid model {{have been developed to}} check data and display deformation, as well as to plot the deformation fields of roller and sleeve. Analytical results provide an effective way to decrease wear and adhesive damage of sleeve, and help to increase the load capacity of oil-film bearing and service life as well...|$|E
50|$|Aside from vocal communication, dingoes communicate, {{like all}} {{domestic}} dogs, via scent marking specific objects (for example, Spinifex) or places (such as waters, trails and hunting grounds) using chemical signals from their urine, feces and scent glands. Males scent-mark {{more frequently than}} females, especially during the mating season. They also scent-rub, whereby a dog <b>rolls</b> its <b>neck,</b> shoulders, or back on something that is usually associated with food or the scent markings of other dogs.|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} {{laboratory}} {{studies of the}} grinding processing process are given {{taking into account the}} evaluation {{of the quality of the}} surfaces of the shafts with disturbing vibrational influences on the equipment of external forces that are the consequence of sea waves, as well as the neighboring operating equipment in a floating workshop. To determine the influence of external influences on the quality of processing during grinding, an experimental stand was used, including a cylindrical grinding machine with a complex of test equipment, as well as a compressor placed at a different distance from the machine, creating external vibration effects simulating external disturbances through the surface Floor and foundation on the machine bed, corresponding to the effects of the external environment and the operating neighboring equipment. The dependences of the frequency of mechanical oscillations (in the measuring zones-the base-bed and the machine table guides in the transverse and vertical directions) are obtained, the amplitude of the vibro-displacement in these zones from the conditions of the circular grinding machine and sea-wave levels. The changes in the error in the shape of the machined parts, the roughness of the machined surface, the waviness of the <b>roll</b> <b>neck</b> surfaces according to the basic and achieved variants are determined taking into account the use of new designs of effective vibration isolating supports and devices...|$|E

5000|$|Introduced in 1961, the EB-3 (based on {{an earlier}} model, the EB-0)was one of the bass guitar {{equivalents}} of the popular Gibson SG. It featured a slim SG-style body, a short 30.5" [...] scale, and two pickups (a large humbucking pickup in the neck position and a mini-humbucker pickup in the bridge position). The electronics consisted of a four-way rotary pickup selector switch (for Series 1 basses; neck pickup with midrange notch, bridge, bridge and neck with low end <b>rolled</b> off <b>neck</b> pickup, neck pickup with choke) and volume and tone knobs for each pickup. The standard finish was cherry red (like the SG guitar models), though EB-3s were also produced in other finishes such as Polaris White, Pelham Blue, Walnut, and Ebony. By the time production ceased in 1979, a total of 14167 instruments had been built.|$|R

25|$|As {{young males}} mature and leave their {{maternal}} groups, they most often remain solitary, although rarely they join an older male. Adult males of similar size/age tend to avoid one another. Occasionally, they meet and spar with their horns in a ritualised manner {{and it is}} rare for serious fights to take place. However, such fights are usually discouraged by visual displays, in which the males bulge their <b>necks,</b> <b>roll</b> their eyes, and hold their horns in a vertical position while slowly {{pacing back and forth}} {{in front of the other}} male. They seek out females only during mating time. When they are with a herd of females, males do not coerce them or try to restrict their movements as do some other antelopes.|$|R
