5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1917, the {{unrestricted}} submarine warfare campaign—which Germany had launched {{at the beginning of}} February—had so succeeded that the entire Allied war effort was endangered. Strong reinforcements to the Allied antisubmarine forces were desperately needed to avert defeat and needed at once. In response to a <b>request</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Royal Navy for the service of American antisubmarine warfare ships in European waters, the United States Navy began sending destroyers eastward across the Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Nuclear Reactor Building was renamed to the More Hall Annex to deter burglary, after a <b>request</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> NRC. Formal {{decommissioning}} of the site, including a $4 million cleanup, began in April 2006, amid student protests over the contractor hired for the work. The NRC formally terminated the university's license to operate the reactor in May 2007.|$|E

Initially drawn from within the British Army from soldiers who volunteered for the Special Service Brigade, the Commandos' ranks would eventually be filled by members of all branches of the British Armed Forces {{and a number of}} foreign volunteers from German-occupied countries.|$|E

5|$|Abandoned or rebellious villages were {{destroyed}} by Ibrahim Pasha's troops, which prevented their inhabitants from returning. Ibrahim's army razed 16 villages before taking Nablus. He also forced {{the heads of the}} Nablus clans to leave for nearby villages. The absence of the traditional local leadership due to exile or execution left Palestine's urban population to be financially exploited by both the government and its local opponents. The imprisoned headmen of villages were replaced by their sons, although Ibrahim Pasha demoted them as nawatir (watchmen) instead of the higher-ranking title of mukhtar. Qasim's son Mahmud replaced him and the popularity of his father among the peasantry compelled the rural chiefs of Jabal Nablus to <b>request</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> government that Mahmud replace Sulaiman Abd al-Hadi as mutasallim of Nablus.|$|E
5|$|Baxter {{had been}} a member of the drama group in Stockton-on-Tees, and had {{performed}} on stage with University Drama Club at UNSW, sometimes with his daughter Valerie. In response to a <b>request</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Australian Elizabethan Theatre Trust in 1958 for improved training of actors, he founded the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA). By 2013, NIDA was regarded as one of the world's finest drama schools, with alumni that included Cate Blanchett, Judy Davis, Mel Gibson, Baz Luhrmann and Hugo Weaving.|$|E
5|$|Baxter {{was born}} in Wales, but grew up in England, {{entering}} the University of Birmingham at age 16. He joined Imperial Chemical Industries as a chemical engineer, and became head of the Central Laboratory of its General Chemicals Division in Widnes, investigating the chemistry of chlorine and fluorine. He {{was elected to the}} Widnes Municipal Council in 1939, a seat he held until 1949. During the Second World War he provided James Chadwick with samples of uranium hexafluoride for Tube Alloys, the British wartime nuclear weapons program, and later established a pilot plant to produce it in Widnes. In 1944, in response to a <b>request</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Americans for someone with expertise in both uranium chemistry and industrial operations, he went to Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to assist the Manhattan Project.|$|E

5|$|British {{military}} forces in Kenya were {{made aware of the}} revolution at 4:45am on 12 January, and following a <b>request</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Sultan were put on 15 minutes' standby to conduct an assault on Zanzibar's airfield. However, the British High Commissioner in Zanzibar, Timothy Crosthwait, reported no instances of British nationals being attacked and advised against intervention. As a result, the British troops in Kenya were reduced to four hours' standby later that evening. Crosthwait decided not to approve an immediate evacuation of British citizens, as many held key government positions and their sudden removal would further disrupt the country's economy and government. To avoid possible bloodshed, the British agreed a timetable with Karume for an organised evacuation.|$|E

Institut Latihan Perindustrian Miri (Miri Industry Training Institute) was formed in 2004, currently offering courses such as electrician, product design, and telecommunication. RIAM Institute of Technology Sarawak (RIAMTEC) was established in 1996, offering technical training {{in the fields of}} agriculture and mechanics. Institut Kemahiran Belia Negara (National Youth skills Institute) and Pusat Pembangunan Kemahiran Sarawak (Sarawak Skills Development Centre) also offer technical training for students. Kolej Komuniti Miri (Miri Community College) offers short module courses upon <b>request</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> public. Open University Malaysia (OUM) also opens a learning centre here.|$|E
5|$|During 1944 the 4th Armoured Brigade {{provided}} crews for comparative {{trials of}} the American M4 Sherman and British Churchill tank in New Guinea conditions that were conducted by the Australian Army {{in response to a}} <b>request</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> British War Office. Macarthur-Onslow proposed including other tanks in these trials, including a British Cromwell that had been shipped to Australia in 1943, but this did not occur. Before the tanks were sent to New Guinea, the 4th Armoured Brigade trialled two Sherman tanks alongside Grants and Matilda IIs in Queensland during mid-1944. The Churchills and Shermans were subsequently trialled in the Madang region of New Guinea; the Churchill proved better suited to jungle conditions. The Australian Army later ordered 510 Churchills, but none were delivered {{before the end of the}} war.|$|E

5|$|Following a <b>request</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Chief of Combined Operations Admiral Louis Mountbatten for probes of German coastal defences, No. 62 Commando, {{also known}} as the Small Scale Raiding Force (SSRF), mounted a number of {{operations}} in 1942. The first three missions were complete successes: Operation Barricade (14/15 August 1942), Operation Dryad, (2/3 September 1942), and Operation Pound (7/8 September 1942). Aquatint was planned for a night in mid September 1942 as a reconnaissance mission near Sainte-Honorine-des-Pertes, a small coastal town near Port en Bessin in Normandy. The mission was to collect information about the surrounding area, and take a German guard prisoner. Aerial reconnaissance had identified a small group of houses on the seafront thought to be occupied by Germans.|$|E
5|$|In November 1942, Carpender {{turned down}} a similar <b>request</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Commander of Allied Land Forces, General Sir Thomas Blamey, for the Allied Naval Forces to escort some small {{transports}} to Oro Bay, as the Imperial Japanese Navy was doing during the Battle of Buna–Gona. However, Carpender subsequently relented somewhat and, starting in December, small ships escorted by corvettes carried out Operation Lilliput to deliver vital supplies to Oro Bay. During the Pacific Military Conference in March 1943, MacArthur's chief of staff, Major General Richard K. Sutherland, spoke to Admiral King and expressed his dissatisfaction with Carpender.|$|E
5|$|In September 1989 the Navy {{announced}} that it had determined that Hartwig intentionally caused the explosion. The victim's family members, many in the media, and the United States Congress rejected the Navy's findings. Sandia National Laboratories, acting on a <b>request</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United States Senate Committee on Armed Services, determined that the explosion {{could have been an}} accident caused by overramming the powder bags into the gun's breech during the loading process. Forced by the revelation to reopen its investigation, the Navy inexplicably, according to Thompson, placed Miceli in charge of the new inquiry.|$|E
