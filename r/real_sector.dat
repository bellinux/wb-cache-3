30|$|In summary, {{there is}} a lot of {{literature}} concerned with the volatility of the <b>real</b> estate <b>sector,</b> while little attention has been paid to systemic risk measure in the <b>real</b> estate <b>sector.</b> <b>Real</b> estate often constitutes a major item on bank balance sheets, and affects banking return (Mei and Anthony 1995; He 2002; Elyasiani et al. 2010; Martins et al. 2011). However, according to our knowledge, there is no study on the investigation of the impact of the <b>real</b> estate <b>sector</b> on banking return from the perspective of systemic risk.|$|R
30|$|Based on Contingent Claims Analysis approach, {{we apply}} the {{weighted}} average Distance-to-Default series as systemic risk measure tools for the <b>real</b> estate <b>sector.</b> And then {{we use the}} vector autoregression model to investigate the impact of systemic risk on banking return in the <b>real</b> estate <b>sector.</b> Empirical results based on Chinese data shows that systemic risk in the <b>real</b> estate <b>sector</b> has {{a negative effect on}} banking return, but this effect is temporary. In addition, the degree of risk aversion and implicit interest expense also have considerable impact on banking return. Our findings have policy and practical implications. First, risk management and policies on the control and management of systemic risk in the <b>real</b> estate <b>sector</b> should not be ignored. Second, the exposition of banks to the <b>real</b> estate <b>sector</b> should be monitored. Finally, the underlying bank return generating models should incorporate an additional risk factor: systemic risk in the <b>real</b> estate <b>sector.</b> In this paper, we use banks’ net interest margin to measure banking return. However, there are many other indicators used in measuring banking return, such as stock return, return on equity and return on assets. Therefore, in the future, we would analyze the impact of systemic risk in the <b>real</b> estate <b>sector</b> on these indicators.|$|R

Most of the literature on systemic risk measures are about banking, as banks have long been known as a source of systemic risk.
