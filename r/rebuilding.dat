The architect Sir Christopher Wren {{was involved in the}} <b>rebuilding</b> of St Paul's Cathedral and more than fifty London churches. King Charles ll did much to foster the <b>rebuilding</b> work. He was a patron of the arts and sciences and founded the Royal Observatory and supported the Royal Society, a scientific group whose early members included Robert Hooke, Robert Boyle and Sir Isaac Newton. In fact, out of the fire and pestilence flowed a renaissance in the arts and sciences in England.|$|E

5|$|Bishop John Innes (1407–14) contributed {{greatly to}} the <b>rebuilding</b> of the cathedral, as {{evidenced}} by the inscription on his tomb praising his efforts. When he died, the chapter met secretly—"in quadam camera secreta in campanili ecclesie Moraviensis"—and agreed that should one of their number be elected to the see, the bishop would grant one-third of the income of the bishopric annually until the <b>rebuilding</b> was finished. The major alterations to the west front were completed before 1435 and contain the arms of Bishop Columba de Dunbar (1422–35), and it is presumed that both the north and south aisles of the choir were finished before 1460, as the south aisle contains the tomb of John de Winchester (1435–60). Probably the last important <b>rebuilding</b> feature was the major restructuring of the chapterhouse between 1482 and 1501, which contains the arms of Bishop Andrew Stewart.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the quake}} {{a program of}} <b>rebuilding</b> was rapidly put into action, but before it began in earnest some {{important}} decisions would permanently differentiate many Sicilian cities and towns from other European urban developments. The Viceroy, the Duke of Camastra, aware of new trends in town planning, decreed that rather than <b>rebuilding</b> in the medieval plan of cramped narrow streets, the new <b>rebuilding</b> would offer piazze and wider main streets, often on a rational grid system. The whole plan was often to take a geometric shape such as a perfect square or a hexagon, typical of Renaissance and Baroque town planning. The city of Grammichele represents an example of these new cities rebuilted with a hexagonal plan.|$|E

5|$|The {{electrification}} of the Chatham Main Line to Dover and Ramsgate in 1959 deprived {{the class}} {{of some of its}} work, as did the transfer of the lines west of Salisbury to the Western Region on 30 December 1962.

Most of the unrebuilt locomotives were withdrawn over the next three years but seven survived until 1967 and the end of steam on the Southern Region. Many rebuilt locomotives were withdrawn soon after their <b>rebuilding.</b> The first was No. 34028 Eddystone in May 1964, having run only 287,000miles since <b>rebuilding.</b> Other early withdrawals included No. 34109 Sir Trafford Leigh-Mallory which had only travelled 162,000miles in the three and a half years since its <b>rebuilding.</b>|$|E

5|$|A second {{hindrance}} to Sicilian architects' fully achieving {{their potential}} earlier was that frequently {{they were only}} <b>rebuilding</b> a damaged structure, {{and as a consequence}} having to match their designs to what had been before, or remained. The Cathedral of San Giorgio at Modica (Illustration 10) is an example. It was badly damaged in the earthquake of 1613, rebuilt in 1643 in a Baroque style while keeping the medieval layout, then damaged again in 1693. <b>Rebuilding</b> again began in 1702, by an unknown architect. Finally, Rosario Gagliardi oversaw the façade's completion in 1760, but the compromises he had to make in deference to the existing structure are obvious. While Gagliardi used the same formulae he used so successfully at the church of San Giorgio in Ragusa, here in Modica the building is heavier, and lacks his usual lightness of touch and freedom of design.|$|E

The Brazos Valley Energy Conservation Coalition (BVECC) has been a <b>Rebuild</b> America since 1996. Since 1996 BVECC has contacted 57 facilities in Texas about joining <b>Rebuild</b> America.
