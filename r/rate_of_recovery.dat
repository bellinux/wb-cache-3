5|$|Despite {{the recent}} successes in Cincinnati, the captive-breeding program has {{remained}} controversial. Proponents {{argue that the}} zoos have not only aided the conservation effort by studying the reproductive habits, raising public awareness and education about the rhinos, helping raise financial resources for conservation efforts in Sumatra but, moreover, to have established a small captive breeding group. Opponents of the captive breeding program argue that the losses are too great; the program is too expensive; removing rhinos from their habitat, even temporarily, alters their ecological role; and captive populations cannot match the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> seen in well-protected native habitats. In October 2015 Harapan, the last rhino in the Western Hemisphere, left the Cincinnati Zoo to Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos) {{is present}} {{in the center of the}} site and threatens to spread into {{herbaceous}} areas. It compromises sustainability of stations, including man orchid and bee orchid populations. Two distinct zones can be distinguished. The first, where the wood small-reed has a very high <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery,</b> is not hosting any heritage value. It is mowed early and disposed of. Grazing is not possible at the moment. The second, on the contrary, not densely colonized by this plant is much more of a fragile situation due to the presence of orchids and the sickle-bearing bush cricket or long-horned groundhopper. Differentiated management is applied depending on the issues. At orchid stations, slight thinning is done early by hand pruning. The less dense areas where the grass is sparse (conducive to the long-horned groundhopper (Tetrix tenuicornis)) are pulled. In the newly opened areas, a systematic and annual pulling avoids expansion. Finally, dense areas, well exposed, are left in that state.|$|E

500|$|A 2008 US Department of Commerce {{analysis}} (SPLASH) {{noted that}} the many challenges to determining the recovery status included the lack of accurate population estimates, the unexpected complexity of population structures and their migration. The report was based on data collected from 2004 to 2006. At the time, the North Pacific population was some 18,302. The estimate {{is consistent with a}} moderate <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> for a depleted population, although it was considered to be a [...] "dramatic increase in abundance" [...] from other post-1960s estimates. By comparison, Calambokidis et al. estimated 9,819, covering 1991–1993. This represents a 4% annual increase in population from 1993 to 2006. The sanctuary provided by US national parks, such as Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve and Cape Hatteras National Seashore, became major factors in population recovery.|$|E
500|$|Two {{additional}} national marches {{were held}} in 1934 and 1936. By this time the country had made a substantial recovery from the worst depression years of 1929–32. Unemployment was significantly down, annual growth was averaging 4%, and {{many parts of the}} country were enjoying a substantial boom in housing and consumer goods. The increasing prosperity was not, however, uniformly spread, and there were sharp contrasts between economic conditions in the south and those in the north-east, South Wales, Scotland and elsewhere, where the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> was much slower. At the same time, the national mood was changing; external factors such as the rise of fascism in Europe helped to unify the British left, and there were more supportive voices in parliament on behalf of the unemployed. The idea of marching as a means of expressing political or social grievances had by now become an accepted and well-established tactic, and there was a growing awareness of the problems complained of, which counterbalanced their exploitation by the Communists. The historian A. J. P. Taylor considered that the hunger marchers had [...] "displayed the failure of capitalism in a way that mere figures or literary description could not. Middle-class people felt the call of conscience".|$|E
500|$|The {{mucilage}} {{produced by}} Drosera has remarkable elastic properties {{and has made}} this genus a very attractive subject in biomaterials research. In one recent study, the adhesive mucilages of three species (D.binata, D.capensis, and D.spatulata) were analyzed for nanofiber and nanoparticle content. [...] Using atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, researchers were able to observe networks of nanofibers and nanoparticles of various sizes within the mucilage residues. In addition, calcium, magnesium, and chlorine – key components of biological salts - were identified. These nanoparticles are theorized to increase the viscosity and stickiness of the mucilage, in turn increasing {{the effectiveness of the}} trap. More importantly for biomaterials research, however, is the fact that, when dried, the mucin provides a suitable substrate for the attachment of living cells. This has important implications for tissue engineering, especially because of the elastic qualities of the adhesive. Essentially, a coating of Drosera mucilage on a surgical implant, such as a replacement hip or an organ transplant, could drastically improve the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> and decrease the potential for rejection, because living tissue can effectively attach and grow on it. The authors also suggest a wide variety of applications for Drosera mucin, including wound treatment, regenerative medicine, or enhancing synthetic adhesives. Also of note, because this mucilage can stretch to nearly a million times its original size and is readily available for use, it can be an extremely cost-efficient source of biomaterial.|$|E

2500|$|The {{black-footed ferret}} was first listed as {{endangered}} in 1967 under the Endangered Species Preservation Act, and was relisted on January 4, 1974, under the Endangered Species Act. In September 2006, South Dakota's ferret population {{was estimated to}} be around 420, with 250 (100 breeding adults consisting of 67 females and 33 males) in Eagle Butte, South Dakota which is 100,000 acres, less than 3 percent of the public grasslands in South Dakota, 70 miles East of Rapid City, South Dakota in the Buffalo Gap National Grassland bordering Badlands National Park, 130 ferrets northeast of Eagle Butte, SD on Cheyenne River Indian Reservation and about 40 ferrets on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. Arizona's Aubrey Valley ferret population was well over 100 and a second reintroduction site with around 50 animals is used. An August 2007 report in the journal Science counted a population of 223 in one area of Wyoming (the original number of reintroduced ferrets, most of which died, was 228), and an annual growth rate of 35% from 2003–2006 was estimated. This <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> is much faster than for many endangered species, and the ferret seems to have prevailed over the previous problems of disease and prey shortage that hampered its improvement. As of 2007, the total wild population of black-footed ferrets in the U.S. was well over 650 individuals, plus 250 in captivity. In 2008, the IUCN reclassified the species as [...] "globally endangered", a substantial improvement since the 1996-assessment, when it was considered extinct in the wild, as the species was indeed only surviving in captivity.|$|E

2500|$|With recent {{knowledge}} of the track, Kienzle was to guide B Company of the 39th Battalion, under Captain Sam Templeton, to Kokoda. [...] This was in compliance with orders for the forward defence of Port Moresby centred on the Kokoda area under the code name [...] "Maroubra". [...] The company departed Illolo on 8 July 1942 and arrived at Kokoda on 15 July. In {{the course of this}} journey, Kienzle identified staging points along the trail and commenced to establish supply dumps. Events quickly overtook the planned deployment, with the Japanese landing at Buna–Gona from 21 July 1942. Additional deployments were made to meet the threat of the advancing Japanese force and with this, the supply situation became increasingly critical. [...] The carrier force was insufficient for the task. Attempts were made to supplement what could be carried forward by air drops. Unreliable maps or poor visibility in the drop zone meant that supplies were often misdropped. In heavily jungled areas, many supplies were lost. Parachutes were in limited supply. As a result, only essential equipment, ammunition and medical supplies were dropped with parachutes. Rations and other supplies were [...] "free dropped". Packaging was primitive and inadequate. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> was low and the rate of breakage high – on average, 50 percent. Kienzle recognised that a better drop zone was needed than what was afforded at either Efogi or Kagi. [...] From pre-war flights across the Owen Stanleys, Kienzle recalled seeing an open area near the crest of the range. [...] On 1 August, he set out from Isurava to find it. [...] On 3 August, he identified the smaller of two dry lake beds, which he called Myola. Kienzle immediately requested that dropping begin at Myola and set about establishing it as a supply camp. Author, Raymond Paull credits the discovery as being [...] "the key to the conduct of the Kokoda campaign", while Peter Brune describes it as the [...] "logistical turning point of the campaign".|$|E
5000|$|According to China's [...] "Energy Blue Paper" [...] {{recently}} {{written by}} the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the average <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> of coal from mining in China is only 30%, less than one-half the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> throughout the world; the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> of coal resources in the U.S., Australia, Germany and Canada is ~80%. The <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> of coal from mining in Shanxi Province, China's largest source of coal is approximately 40%, though the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> of village and township coal mines in Shanxi Province is only 10%-20%. Cumulatively {{over the course of}} the past 20 years (1980-2000) China has wasted upwards of 28 gigatons of coal. The same causes for a low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> in coal mining—that extraction methods are backwards—lead to safety problems in China's coal mining sector. Another reason for the low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> is that the majority of extraction comes from small-scale mining; of the 346.9 gigatons of coal extracted by China, only 98 gigatons has come from large or mid-sized mines while 250 gigatons are extracted from small mines. Based on coal production in 2005 of 2.19 gigatons and a current <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> of 30%, if China were able to double its <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> it would save approximately 3.5 gigatons of coal.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients {{started on}} long term {{hemodialysis}} have typically had low <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> reported renal <b>recovery</b> with recent estimates ranging from 0. 9 - 2. 4 % while higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>recovery</b> {{have been reported}} in cohorts with higher percentages of patients with acute renal failure requiring dialysis. STUDY DESIGN: Our analysis followed approximately 194, 000 patients who were initiated on hemodialysis during a 2 -year period (2008 & 2009) with CMS- 2728 forms submitted to CMS by dialysis facilities, cross-referenced with patient record updates through the end of 2010, and tracked through December 2010 in the CMS SIMS registry. RESULTS: We report a sustained renal recovery (i. e no return to ESRD during the available follow up period) rate among Medicare ESRD patients of > 5 % - much higher than previously reported. Recovery occurred primarily in the first 2 months post incident dialysis, and was more likely in cases with renal failure secondary to etiologies associated with acute kidney injury. Patients experiencing sustained recovery were markedly less likely than true long-term ESRD patients to have permanent vascular accesses in place at incident hemodialysis, while non-White patients, and patients with any prior nephrology care appeared to have significantly lower <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> renal <b>recovery.</b> We also found widespread geographic variation in the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> renal <b>recovery</b> across the United States.
