This remanent magnetization, or <b>remanence,</b> can be acquired {{in more than one}} way.

500|$|Although {{an ancient}} {{hematite}} artifact from the Olmec era in Mexico dating to roughly 1000 BC indicates the possible {{use of the}} lodestone compass long before it was described in China, the Olmecs did not have iron which the Chinese would discover could be magnetised by contact with lodestone. Descriptions of lodestone attracting iron {{were made in the}} Guanzi, Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals and Huainanzi. The Chinese by the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) began using north-south oriented lodestone ladle-and-bowl shaped compasses for divination and geomancy and not yet for navigation. The Lunheng, written by Han dynasty writer, scientist, and philosopher Wang Chong (27– c. 100 AD) stated in chapter 52: [...] "This instrument resembles a spoon and when it is placed on a plate on the ground, the handle points to the south". There are, however, another two references under chapter 47 of the same text to the attractive power of a magnet according to Needham (1986), but Li Shu-hua (1954) considers it to be lodestone, and states that there is no explicit mention of a magnet in Lunheng. Shen Kuo (1031–1095) of the Song Dynasty (960–1279) was the first to accurately describe both magnetic declination (in discerning true north) and the magnetic needle compass in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, while the Song dynasty writer Zhu Yu (fl. 12th century) was the first to mention use of the compass specifically for navigation at sea in his book published in 1119. Even before this, however, the Wujing Zongyao military manuscript compiled by 1044 described a thermoremanence compass of heated iron or steel shaped as a fish and placed in a bowl of water which produced a weak magnetic force via <b>remanence</b> and induction; the Wujing Zongyao recorded that it was used as a pathfinder along with the mechanical south-pointing chariot.|$|E

2500|$|When the {{capacitor}} is discharging, {{the strength}} of the electric field is decreasing and the common orientation of the molecular dipoles is returning to an undirected state in a process of relaxation. Due to the hysteresis, at the zero point of the electric field, a material-dependent number of molecular dipoles are still polarized along the field direction without a measurable voltage appearing at the terminals of the capacitor. This is like an electrical <b>remanence.</b> The oriented dipoles will be discharged spontaneously over time and the voltage at the electrodes of the capacitor will decay exponentially. The complete discharge time of all dipoles can be days to weeks depending on the material. This [...] "reloaded" [...] voltage can be retained for months, even in electrolytic capacitors, caused by the high insulation resistance in common modern capacitor dielectrics. The discharge of a capacitor and the subsequent reloading can be repeated several times.|$|E

40|$|Remanent {{magnetization}} {{measurements were}} made on 49 samples of upper Jurassic limestone varying in color from gray to red and 7 samples of basalt recovered at Site 367. The gray limestones have very weak magnetizations and are of limited use paleomagnetically. The red limestones have stronger <b>remanences</b> and fair to good magnetic stabilities. The mean remanent inclination of the most reliable set of red limestone samples (N=l 4) after 200 -oe AF demagnetization is 25 °± 5. 1 °, near the present axial dipole field inclination (24 °) {{as well as the}} expected inclination of the Jurassic field (21 ° to 30 °) at the core site. A single stable reversed direction of magnetization (Sample 33 - 3, 88 cm) may represent the earliest interval of reversed geomagnetic field polarity of the late Jurassic-early Cretaceous magnetic reversal sequence. The basalt samples had very unstable remanent magnetic properties, characterized by median demagnetizing fields less than 100 oe. The samples were able to acquire large viscous <b>remanences</b> (VRM) in the laboratory in a 1. 0 -oe field. Moreover, the intensity of VRM acquired {{in the presence of the}} NRM was at least a factor of five greater than that acquired under similar conditions but after AF demagnetization.

30|$|Although not remarked upon in any {{detail in}} most cases, similar {{magnetization}} dips and recoveries {{have been observed}} previously in cycling 300 -K <b>remanences</b> (Hartstra 1982, 1983; Halgedahl and Jarrard 1995; Özdemir and Dunlop 1999; Muxworthy and McClelland 2000; King and Williams 2000; Özdemir et al. 2002; Kosterov 2003).

50|$|Often {{a single}} measure of <b>remanence</b> {{does not provide}} {{adequate}} information on a magnet.

Magnetic minerals in rocks may have a wide range of magnetic properties (see rock magnetism). One way to look inside these materials is to add or subtract small increments of <b>remanence.</b> One way of doing this is first demagnetizing the magnet in an AC field, and then applying a field H and removing it.

30|$|The rock-magnetic {{measurement}} {{results indicate that}} the predominant carrier of magnetic <b>remanences</b> in the sediments is PSD, or a mixture of SD and MD-sized (titano)magnetite (Figs.  3 and 4), and the fluctuations in κ and κARM range within an order of magnitude (Fig.  6 g). From these results, the sediment satisfies the criteria for relative paleointensity reconstruction proposed by Tauxe (1993). To obtain an appropriate proxy for relative paleointensity, we compared the NRM/ARM ratios from three different coercivity fractions, which were between 20 and 40  mT, 30 and 50  mT, and 30 and 40  mT. The variations of the three coercivity fractions were almost identical, and we therefore used the NRM/ARM ratio between 20 and 40  mT as a proxy for relative paleointensity in this study (Fig.  6 f).|$|R

30|$|The Takanoobane {{rhyolite}} lava yields two remanent magnetization components, both {{of which}} are considered to be of thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) origin. These components are considered primary in origin because of the following reasons. (1) A 51 kyr exposure in the magnetic field is expected to result in a laboratory unblocking temperature of a viscous overprint below 200 °C for magnetite (Pullaiah et al., 1975), which is less than that of the observed low-temperature component by > 250 °C. (2) Optical microscopic observations of polished thin sections of rhyolite under transmitted and reflected light indicate little or no chemical alteration after its emplacement in both magnetic minerals and other phenocrysts. (3) The thermomagnetic results show a single magnetic phase that is indicative of low-Ti titanomagnetite. These observations provide evidence for a primary origin of the observed <b>remanences.</b>|$|R

Comparison of this apparent polar wander path with the estab-lished path for Britain throws new light on the sequence of thrusting and magmatic activity in the NW Highlands and precludes large-scale (5 1500 km) movement along the Great Glen Fault later than the Ordovician. The data emphasize previously published discrepancies between the apparent polar wander paths of Britain, Baltica and Laurentia and are con-sistent with the suggestion that Britain was among a set of intracratonic microplates which underwent complicated, distinct movements throughout the Caledonian orogeny...|$|R
30|$|Another {{complexity}} can {{be caused}} by the presence of titanomaghemite. Titanomaghemite, which is usually formed by low-temperature oxidation (maghemitization) of titanomagnetite in nature, can acquire a partial or complete self-reversed chemical remanent magnetization (CRM) that replaces the original detrital remanent magnetization (DRM) or thermoremanent magnetization (TRM) (e.g. Doubrovine and Tarduno 2004; Krása et al. 2005; Channell and Xuan 2009; Xuan and Channell 2010; Xuan et al. 2012). As a possible mechanism of the self-reversal, ionic reordering (Doubrovine and Tarduno 2004, 2006 a) and magnetic coupling between titanomagnetite and oxidized titanomaghemite in a close side-by-side assemblage (Krása et al. 2005) have been suggested. Moreover, observations of self-reversal for titanomaghemites by Doubrovine and Tarduno (2005, 2006 a, b) suggest that a finite range of high oxidation states of z (O’reilly 2012) of no less than 0.9 and relatively high Ti contents (x) of no less than 0.6 are required to generate self-reversed <b>remanences.</b>|$|R
