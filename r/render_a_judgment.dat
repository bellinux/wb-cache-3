50|$|Subject-matter {{jurisdiction}} must {{be distinguished}} from personal jurisdiction, which {{is the power of}} a court to <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> against a particular defendant, and territorial jurisdiction, which is the power of the court to <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> concerning events that have occurred within a well-defined territory. Unlike personal or territorial jurisdiction, lack of subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived. A judgment from a court that did not have subject-matter jurisdiction is forever a nullity. To decide a case, a court must have a combination of subject (subjectam) and either personal (personam) or territorial (locum) jurisdiction.|$|E
50|$|Territorial {{jurisdiction}} in United States law {{refers to a}} court's power over events and persons {{within the bounds of}} a particular geographic territory. If a court does not have territorial jurisdiction over the events or persons within it, then the court cannot bind the defendant to an obligation or adjudicate any rights involving them. Territorial jurisdiction is to be distinguished from subject-matter jurisdiction, which is the power of a court to <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> concerning a certain subject matter, or personal jurisdiction, which is the power of a court to <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> concerning particular persons, wherever they may be. Personal jurisdiction, territorial jurisdiction, subject-matter jurisdiction, and proper notice to the defendant are prerequisites for a valid judgment.|$|E

50|$|If the {{defendant}} accepts the claim or admits all the facts, the court can <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> without a trial.

50|$|Bifurcation is a judge's {{ability in}} law to divide a trial {{into two parts}} so as to <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> {{on a set of}} legal issues without looking at all aspects. Frequently, civil cases are {{bifurcated}} into separate liability and damages proceedings. Criminal trials are also often bifurcated into guilt and sentencing phases, especially in capital cases.|$|E
5000|$|Benson {{also notes}} {{that there was a}} {{well-developed}} system of private arbitration: [...] These Indian tribes nevertheless had a well-developed system of private judging. For instance, if a Yurok wanted to process a legal claim he would hire two, three, or four [...] "crossers" [...] - nonrelatives from a community other than his own. The defendant in the claim would also hire crossers, and the entire group hired by both parties would act as go-betweens, ascertaining claims and defenses and gathering evidence. The crossers would <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> for damages after hearing all the evidence.|$|E

5000|$|A {{respondent}} {{that does}} not wish to submit to the jurisdiction of the Court may raise Preliminary Objections. Any such objections must be ruled upon before the Court can address the merits of the applicant's claim. Often, a separate public hearing is held on the Preliminary Objections and the Court will <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment.</b> Respondents normally file Preliminary Objections to the jurisdiction of the Court and/or the admissibility of the case. Inadmissibility refers to a range of arguments about factors the Court should take into account in deciding jurisdiction, such as the fact that the issue is not justiciable or {{that it is not a}} [...] "legal dispute".|$|E

50|$|In 1977 Paul {{sued the}} United States in the Court of Claims {{arguing that the}} ANCSA had unconstitutionally infringed on his contract.

Also in 1977, Paul sued the United States, the villages and several associations in Alaska federal court for his own fees and the fees of other attorneys. The court dismissed this claim citing {{that they were not}} contracts made under the ANCSA or claims that could be paid otherwise. Paul re-filed suit against the United States, ASNA, and eight villages for fees in the Western District of Washington during the same year, only to have the court suspend the case in light of the other pending litigation.|$|E
5000|$|The Court for the Trial of Impeachments, and the Correction of Errors was {{established}} by the New York State Constitution of 1777. It consisted then of the Lieutenant Governor of New York (who is ex officio President of the State Senate), the Chancellor, the justices of the New York Supreme Court {{and the members of}} the New York State Senate. It had two distinct jurisdictions: the trial of State officers who had been impeached by the New York State Assembly, and it served as a [...] "court of last resort" [...] in which decisions, which had become final after being upheld by the New York Supreme Court and the Chancellor, could be reversed on non-judicial grounds, since this court did not <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> of law, but consisting of politicians rather than lawyers, could consider political, moral, ethical or other subjective points of view.|$|E

[...] Therefore, the assessment of most civil penalties requires a finding of [...] "clear and convincing evidence" [...] before a civil defendant will be held liable. A defendant may well raise excuses, justifications, affirmative defenses, and procedural defenses. An administrative law judge or hearing officer may oversee the proceedings and <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment.</b> Judgment is made on the balance of probabilities.

Dr. Mandler was clearly ahead of his times with his developments. That is proven by the numerous optical computations that still have lost nothing in terms of current relevance. Among them is the 50 mm f/1 Noctilux-M lens that he designed. Today, many publications still refer to his work, notably the landmark 50 mm f/2 Summicron-M lens. And there are numerous other examples that prove how important his work was for the evolution of photographic optics in general and for the evolution of photography at Leitz.

5000|$|While {{the state}} of Texas argued that “this {{intangible}} property {{should be treated as}} situated in Texas, so as to permit that State to escheat,” two other areas, {{the state of}} New Jersey, where Sun Oil Co. was incorporated, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, where their corporate offices were located, argued for their own right to escheat. Since the Supreme Court had ruled three years previously, in [...] Western Union Co. v Pennsylvania (1961), that one state had “no power to <b>render</b> <b>a</b> <b>judgment</b> of escheat which would bar...any other State from escheating the same property”, the state of Texas petitioned the court, under Art.

Noting that “since the States separately are without constitutional power to provide a rule to settle this interstate controversy and since there is no applicable federal statute,” the Court accepted the case, arguing that it was their responsibility “in the exercise of our original jurisdiction to adopt a rule which will settle the question of which State will be allowed to escheat this intangible property.” ...|$|E
