In a first experimental trial, the susceptibility of recent isolated French Eimeria field strains to in-feed use of diclazuril, salinomycin and <b>robenidine</b> was studied in fattening rabbits. Rabbits were challenged {{at the age}} of 31 d with a mixed inoculum of Eimeria magna, E. media and E. perforans. Production data and oocyst excretion were compared with an infected-untreated control group and an uninfected-untreated control group. Infection resulted in significantly lower production data and higher oocyst excretion in the infected-untreated control group. Salinomycin and diclazuril treated rabbits were able to control the infection, demonstrated also by comparable weight gain and final weight to those of the uninfected-untreated control rabbits and significantly higher than those of the infected-untreated control rabbits. Based on the production data and oocyst excretion, <b>robenidine</b> was not able to control the infection adequately. Economic performance (weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion) and oocyst excretion were significantly worse than in the uninfected-untreated controls.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of anticoccidial agents on production and reproduction of broiler breeders. In Experiment 1, nicarbazin (NCZ) was fed at 20, 50, and 100 ppm. There was no depression in egg production, egg weight, or fertility from feeding these levels. As level of NCZ increased, there was a linear decrease in hatchability. The amount of 4, 4 '-dinitrocarbanilide (DNC) in the egg yolks increased linearly as the levels of NCZ went up; the degree of egg-shell depigmentation was directly related to the level of NCZ fed starting at 50 ppm. Experiment 2 utilized a different strain of broiler breeders. Halofuginone (3 ppm), maduramicin (5 ppm), monensin (100 ppm), narasin (70 ppm), NCZ (125 ppm), <b>robenidine</b> (33 ppm), and salinomycin (60 ppm) were fed to broiler breeders at the levels listed. Only NCZ reduced egg production. Narasin induced a reduction in egg weight. Both narasin and salinomycin caused a significant drop in hatchability. Feeding NCZ also induced a rapid and more severe decrease in hatchability. Monensin was the only anticoccidial agent that reduced fertility. Halofuginone, maduramicin, and <b>robenidine</b> had no biologically significant effect on hen-day production, egg weight, hatch of fertile eggs, or shell depigmentation.

Glycarbylamide, amprolium, nicarbazin, and the 6 -(p-bromophenoxy) - 7 -chloro analog of halofuginone (Stenorol; Roussel-UCLAF) (CP- 63, 567) were toxic for the fibroblasts. Since Eimeria tenella has a similar drug susceptibility profile, anticoccidial durgs {{can be viewed as a}} potential source of new antitoxoplasma therapies. The development of resistance has limited the usefulness of most of these drugs as anticoccidial agents; in coccidia, resistance to all except the ionophores occurs readily in vivo. We explored the development of resistance in T. gondii by attempting to select mutants in vitro from parasites mutagenized with ethylnitrosourea. Mutants that had 20 - to 50 -fold-reduced susceptibility to decoquinate, arprinocid-N-oxide, and CP- 25, 415 were obtained. Ionophore-resistant T. gondii mutants were also selected in vitro; however, there was only a twofold difference in susceptibility between these mutants and the wild type. For three drugs (clopidol, <b>robenidine,</b> and toltrazuril), we were unable to select resistant mutants. For experimental anticoccidial drugs, there is currently no in vitro method for assessing the risk of development of resistance in Eimeria species.

40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of anticoccidial agents on the production and reproduction of White Leghorns. In Experiment 1, nicarbazin (NCZ) was fed at 0, 20, 50, and 100 ppm. Hen-day egg production, egg weight, the egg-yolk DNC (4 - 4 '-dinitrocarbanilide) level, and egg-yolk mottling were affected by the treatments. When response was evidenced, the relationship between those variables and the level of NCZ was basically linear. Decreased egg production occurred from Days 5 and 6 of the treatment through Days 1 and 2 of withdrawal. On Days 9 and 10 of treatment, the control hens peaked at 92 % hen-day production, while hens fed 20, 50, and 100 ppm of NCZ peaked late-at 90, 82, and 80 %, respectively. Compared to the controls, egg weight was reduced linearly as the level of dietary NCZ increased. The egg-yolk DNC level increased from Days 3 and 4 of treatment through Days 9 and i 0 of withdrawal. Egg yolk mottling generally increased along with the level and duration of feeding NCZ. If the NCZ was mistakenly fed to White Leghorn layers, ill effects would be alleviated within 10 days after drug withdrawal. In Experiment 2, halofuginone (3 ppm), maduramicin (5 ppm), monensin (100 ppm), narasin (70 ppm), nicarbazin (125 ppm), <b>robenidine</b> (33 ppm), and salinomycin (60 ppm) were fed to White Leghorn hens at the levels specified in parentheses.

NCL 195 was less cytotoxic to mammalian cell lines than the parent compound, showed low metabolic degradation rates by human and mouse liver microsomes, and exhibited high plasma concentration and low plasma clearance rates in mice. NCL 195 was bactericidal against Acinetobacter spp and Neisseria meningitidis and also demonstrated potent activity against A. baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp. in the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and polymyxin B.

40|$|Coccidiosis, an {{intestinal}} plasmodium infection, {{is a major}} {{infectious disease}} in poultry and rabbits. Eleven different coccidiostats are licensed in the EU {{for the prevention of}} coccidiosis in these animal species. According to their chemical nature and main biological activity, these compounds can be grouped as ionophoric (monensin, lasalocid sodium, salinomycin, narasin, maduramicin and semduramicin) or non-ionophoric (<b>robenidine,</b> decoquinate, nicarbazin, diclazuril, and halofuginone) substances. Coccidiostats are used as feed additives, mixed upon request into the compounded feed. During the technical process of commercial feed production, cross-contamination of feed batches can result in the exposure of non-target animals and induce adverse health effects in these animals due to a specific sensitivity of mammalian species as compared to poultry. Residue formation in edible tissues of non-target species may result in unexpected human exposure through the consumption of animal products. This review presents recent risk assessments performed by the Scientific Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain (CONTAM) of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The health risk to non-target species that would result from the consumption of cross-contaminated feed with coccidostats at levels of 2, 5 or 10 % was found to be negligible for most animal species with the exception of salinomycin and monensin in horses because of the particular sensitivity for which toxicity may occur when cross-contamination exceeds 2 % and 5 % respectively. Kinetic data and tissue analyses showed that residues of coccidiostats may occur in the liver and eggs in some cases. However, the level of residues of each coccidiostat in edible animal tissues remained sufficiently low that the aggregate exposure of consumers would not exceed the established acceptable daily intake (ADI) of each coccidiostat. It could be concluded that technical cross-contamination of animal feeds would not be expected to adversely affect the health of consumers...|$|E
