5|$|While the Soviet {{team was}} in Canada, Rick Noonan, a trainer for the University of British Columbia’s sports teams, was {{assigned}} by Hockey Canada {{to assist the}} Soviets. Noonan, who would be later be named general manager of Team Canada for the 1980 Winter Olympics, was the only Canadian to have regular access to the Soviet's locker <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was behind the Soviet's bench during the first four games of the Summit Series.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} is postponed {{and the parents}} are out looking for work when a prospective tenant appears. Mrs. O'Brien shows him the <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is interested, but {{does not know what}} to do with the children. Mrs. O'Brien puts the children out onto the street where they dance to the music played by an organ grinder. The organ grinder earns more money from their dancing and he entices the children to return to his hovel and teaches them to dance. The organ grinder instructs them to dance for money. The children are rescued by a theater manager and finds them a place in the theater program.|$|E
5|$|In early 1994, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a European tour. Nirvana's final concert took place in Munich, Germany, on March 1. In Rome, {{on the morning of}} March 4, Cobain's wife, Courtney Love, found Cobain unconscious in their hotel <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was rushed to the hospital. A doctor from the hospital told in a press conference that Cobain had reacted to a combination of prescribed Rohypnol and of alcohol. The rest of the tour was cancelled. In the ensuing weeks, Cobain's heroin addiction resurfaced. An intervention was organized, and Cobain was convinced to admit himself into drug rehabilitation. After less than a week in rehabilitation, Cobain climbed over the wall of the facility and took a plane back to Seattle. A week later, on Friday, April 8, 1994, Cobain was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head at his home in Seattle.|$|E
60|$|Making {{a mental}} note of both, Ralph hurried out. A {{policeman}} directed him to the tall office building in which his friend had <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was soon on his way thither.|$|R
60|$|Then were Christiana, Mercy, and {{the boys}} the more glad, for that the Innkeeper was a lover of pilgrims. So they called for <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> showed them one for Christiana, and her children, and Mercy, and another for Mr. Great-heart and the old gentleman.|$|R
6000|$|<b>And</b> <b>he</b> {{proceeded}} to give Hall a vivid {{description of his}} grotesque guest. [...] "Looks {{a bit like a}} disguise, don't it?

[...] "But women are that trustful--where strangers are concerned. <b>He's</b> took your <b>rooms</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> ain't even given a name, Hall." ...|$|R
25|$|Mark Niederbrock {{arrived at}} the home Sept. 17 about 5 p.m., and McCroskey {{attacked}} him with the maul in a living room, Ennis said.

25|$|In Game 2, {{home plate}} umpire Kerwin Danley appealed {{a call to}} the first base umpire after calling strike three; the first base umpire called ball four to award the Rays' Rocco Baldelli a walk.

25|$|Professor Philip Steadman {{published}} the book Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth behind the Masterpieces in 2001 which specifically claimed that Vermeer {{had used a}} camera obscura to create his paintings. Steadman noted that many of Vermeer's paintings had been painted in the same <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> found six of his paintings that are precisely the right size {{if they had been}} painted from inside a camera obscura in the room's back wall.|$|E

60|$|GAIUS. Yes, gentlemen, if ye be true men, for {{my house}} is for none but pilgrims. Then was Christiana, Mercy, and the boys, the more glad, for that the Inn-keeper was a lover of pilgrims.

25|$|In 1802, Horatio Nelson {{was awarded}} {{the freedom of the}} borough and stayed at The Angel {{coaching}} inn on Broad Street, together with his mistress Emma and her husband Sir William Hamilton. The honour was presented to him in a room at the inn, later {{to be known as the}} Nelson <b>Room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> addressed the crowds from one of the bay windows on the first floor. During the Napoleonic Wars, Lucien Bonaparte, younger brother of the French Emperor, and his family were imprisoned at Dinham House in 1811.|$|E
500|$|In his {{two years}} at Alabama, Cody became the Tide's most popular player because of his outsized {{personality}} and body. Former Alabama quarterback Greg McElroy said of Cody: [...] "He's an enjoyable person to have on our team, have in the locker <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> (<b>he)</b> has great charisma. He has fun when he plays the game, and that's a big reason why he's so popular." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 25, 1988, {{at the age}} of 52 (and 14 {{months after}} the death of Andy Warhol), Solanas died of {{pneumonia}} at the Bristol Hotel in the Tenderloin district of San Francisco. A building superintendent at the hotel, not on duty that night, had a vague memory of Solanas: [...] "Once, he had to enter her <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> saw her typing at her desk. There was a pile of typewritten pages beside her. What she was writing and what happened to the manuscript remain a mystery." [...] Her mother burned all her belongings posthumously.|$|E
6000|$|... "The very thing. You've heard him. And saying our {{fortunes}} were made.

500|$|Bride {{heard the}} band playing {{as he left}} the radio cabin, which was by now awash, in the company of the other radio operator, Jack Phillips. He had just had a fight with a man who Bride thought was [...] "a stoker, or someone from below decks", who had {{attempted}} to steal Phillips' lifebelt. Bride wrote later: [...] "I did my duty. I hope I finished [...] I don't know. We left him on the cabin floor of the radio <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was not moving." [...] The two radio operators went in opposite directions, Phillips aft and Bride forward towards collapsible lifeboat B.|$|E
500|$|One night, Dussander {{tries to}} kill a hobo who earlier had seen him in the uniform. When Dussander has a heart attack, he calls Todd, who {{finishes}} the job, cleans up, and calls an ambulance for Dussander. At the hospital, Dussander is recognized by a death camp survivor sharing his <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is arrested, prior to being extradited to Israel. Todd graduates as his school's valedictorian and gives a speech about Icarus, saying, [...] "All great achievements arose from dissatisfaction. It is the desire to do better, to dig deeper, that propels civilization to greatness." [...] The scene is juxtaposed in a montage with Dussander's home being searched and the hobo's corpse being found in the basement.|$|E
500|$|Back in Los Angeles, Beck {{began to}} work at a video store in Silver Lake [...] "doing things like {{alphabetizing}} the pornography section". He began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as Al's Bar and Raji's. In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner. [...] "I'd be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking. So maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience's boredom, I'd make up these ridiculous songs just to see if people were listening," [...] he later remarked. Virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him, Beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play [...] "strange folk songs", accompanied by [...] "what could best be described as performance art" [...] while sometimes wearing a Star Wars stormtrooper mask. Beck met someone who offered to help record demos in his living <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> began to pass cassette tapes around.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but I {{wish she}} didn't keep awake {{with such a}} din," [...] said the judge. After all, he admired Lottie's {{judgment}} about the <b>rooms,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> censured her {{with a sigh of}} relief from care as he sank back in the easy-chair fronting the window that looked out on the North Sea; Lottie had already made him appreciate the view till he was almost sick of it.|$|R
60|$|Then {{all became}} {{quiet in the}} <b>room</b> beyond, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> {{wondered}} if Churchley had not joined the two in the adjoining apartment.|$|R

500|$|Morrison and EMI {{producer}} Norman Smith negotiated Pink Floyd's first recording contract, {{and as part}} of the deal, {{the band}} agreed to record their first album at EMI Studios in London. Mason recalled that the sessions were trouble-free. Smith disagreed, stating that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. EMI-Columbia released The Piper at the Gates of Dawn in August 1967. The album peaked at number 6, spending 14 weeks on the UK charts. One month later, it was released under the Tower Records label. Pink Floyd continued to draw large crowds at the UFO Club; however, Barrett's mental breakdown was by then causing serious concern. The group initially hoped that his erratic behaviour would be a passing phase, but some were less optimistic, including Jenner and his assistant, June Child, who commented: [...] "I found [...] in the dressing <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> was so... gone. Roger Waters and I got him on his feet, [...] we got him out to the stage... The band started to play and Syd just stood there. He had his guitar around his neck and his arms just hanging down".|$|E
500|$|The final {{song on the}} record, [...] "Whipping Post," [...] {{was written}} shortly after Allman {{returned}} to Jacksonville. The song came to him shortly before bed, but {{he was unable to}} acquire a pencil and paper to write down his ideas, as there was a child asleep in the <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> could not turn on the lights. Turning to his next best alternative, he struck two kitchen matches (one for light and one, later blown out, as a charcoal writing utensil) and wrote down his lyrics on a bedside ironing board. [...] "Whipping Post" [...] was similar in composition to [...] "Dreams" [...] in its first incarnation, with Oakley later creating the heavy bassline that starts off the track. Duane and Betts take quick solos before the track builds to an [...] "anguished climax," [...] leading to Gregg Allman's solo voice, singing the song's refrain: [...] "Good Lord, I feel like I'm dyin'." [...] Allman had no idea the intro was written in 11/4 time — [...] "I just saw it as three sets of three, and then two to jump on the next three sets with" [...] — until his brother pointed it out for him. [...] "My brother told me — I guess the day I wrote it — he said, 'That's good, man. I didn’t know you understood 11/4.' Of course I said something intelligent like, 'What's 11/4?' Duane just said, 'Okay, dumbass, I'll try to draw it up on paper for you.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In the 2007–08 season, Kisnorbo was {{relegated to}} League One with the club, {{but was also}} on the {{receiving}} end of no less than three controversial refereeing decisions. His first was a goal against Scunthorpe United on 20 October, which referee Scott Mathieson ruled out for an offside, depriving Leicester of an away win. Video replay showed that Kisnorbo's disallowed goal was actually onside, greatly frustrating him, while Leicester coach Gerry Taggart commented [...] "We have all seen the replay of Patrick's goal in the dressing <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is clearly not offside." [...] Kisnorbo's second was a red card by referee Phil Joslin for what the linesman claimed was a foul on Pablo Couñago. Joslin awarded Ipswich Town a penalty kick, and Ipswich won 3–1. Joslin admitted his mistake, and had the ban rescinded the following day after video replays showed Kisnorbo actually won the ball outside the penalty area. Leicester's then-manager Ian Holloway described the sending off as a [...] "complete kerfuffle". The Leicester club was fined £3,000 by The Football Association, however, because of Kisnorbo's teammates' angry appeals to Joslin during the game. Kisnorbo's third was another red card by referee Mike Pike for a foul on Billy Sharp on 5 April 2008. Pike awarded Sheffield United a penalty kick as they won 3–0. Video replays, however, showed no contact between the two, confirming that Sharp was diving. Holloway branded Pike's decision [...] "embarrassing", saying [...] "that was the biggest blunder I've seen in a long time." [...] Leicester also succeeded in their appeal against the second red card.|$|E

500|$|Although he {{initially}} helps the Winchesters in Season 7 {{in their struggle}} against the Leviathans—God's original creations, trapped for millennia in Purgatory until they were unintentionally released by Castiel—despite the destruction of his house, even determining their new foes' vulnerability to the chemical Borax, Bobby is eventually {{shot in the head}} by Dick Roman in [...] "How to Win Friends and Influence Monsters". He spends the next episode, [...] "Death's Door", in a coma, trying to reawaken to reveal the Leviathan's plot. Despite efforts to save him, Bobby flatlines from his injuries; his last word being [...] "idjits" [...] (sic, idiots) to Sam and Dean after passing on a sequence of numbers. The episode ends with a reaper asking Bobby if he is going to become a ghost or move on to the afterlife. It's indicated that he stayed as a ghost to help the boys as there have been times since his death when the information they need inexplicably makes itself known to them, but they were initially unable to confirm or deny Bobby's possible presence. During [...] "Party On, Garth," [...] Sam reveals that he tried to use a talking board to contact him if he is still around, but received no response. However, Garth registers high readings on an EMF detector around Bobby's old flask, and when Dean needed a sword to slay a shojo, it inexplicably slid across the ground to him, leading him to believe that Bobby had helped him. At the end of the episode, Bobby's spirit {{can be seen in the}} brother's motel <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> is annoyed when Dean comes in, looks right at him, and does not see him, instead grabbing his flask.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert {{had also}} been engaged by a club called East Gloucestershire, based in Cheltenham, which played minor cricket. The {{explanation}} for Gilbert's disappearance was {{to be found in}} a match he played for the club on 4 and 5 June 1886. Before the second day's play, Gilbert arrived early at the ground and went into the pavilion. Because several sums of money had recently gone missing from the pavilion, a policeman was hidden in the team's dressing <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> saw Gilbert searching clothes and stealing money. On being confronted, Gilbert produced the coins, one of which had been marked so that it could be identified. The East Gloucestershire match continued, but Gilbert's name was omitted from the published scorecard; the wickets he had taken on the first day were credited to [...] "Smith", and either only ten players were listed or Gilbert's position in the batting order was taken by [...] "Mr E. L. Even", who did not bat. Gilbert had been selected for Gloucestershire's first-class match against Sussex on 7 June, but he was dropped from the side and his place taken by a player making his only appearance in the side. Gilbert was in Police Court while the match was taking place, charged with theft. He admitted stealing from two men and expressed remorse. According to the report in The Times, he stated that if he were forgiven, he would move to Australia; his solicitor argued that Gilbert had been [...] "harassed and worried" [...] for some time and was suffering from erysipelas and could barely control his own behaviour. His solicitor requested that any punishment should allow Gilbert to go overseas, but Gilbert was sentenced to 28days imprisonment. Gilbert's family then arranged for him to move to Canada; {{at the time it was}} common for families to send disgraced members to distant parts of the British Empire to minimise scandal.|$|E
2500|$|In the afternoon, the {{resident}} assistant confronted Ravi about Clementi's written complaint, {{in which he}} requested a room change. [...] Within a few hours, Clementi returned to his dorm <b>room</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> and Ravi were there for less than an hour.|$|E
60|$|He {{was some}} time in Mr. Donald's <b>room</b> <b>and,</b> when <b>he</b> came out, {{proceeded}} at once to mix him a soothing draught, from the case of medicines he carried behind the saddle.|$|R
60|$|Rupert saw, however, {{that even}} while {{speaking}} his eye was wandering round the <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> directly <b>he</b> perceived him he walked straight towards him, those standing between falling {{back as he}} advanced.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He isn't in the Pav.,' said Baker. 'I've {{just come}} out of the First <b>room</b> myself, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> wasn't there. Shouldn't wonder if he's over at Leicester's.' ...|$|R
