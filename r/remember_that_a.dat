25|$|Considering the biomechanical {{force system}} {{generated}} by a cantilever, {{it is important to}} <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> combination of a moment and a force is produced at the unit into which the cantilever is inserted, whereas only a single force is developed with respect to the point of force application of the other end. The magnitude of the two forces is equal and opposite, according to the third law of Newton, and the activation can be measured by a dynamometer.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{identification}} to genus {{can often}} be accomplished in the field using a local mushroom guide. Identification to species, however, requires more effort; one must <b>remember</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> mushroom develops from a button stage into a mature structure, and only the latter can provide certain characteristics needed for {{the identification of the}} species. However, over-mature specimens lose features and cease producing spores. Many novices have mistaken humid water marks on paper for white spore prints, or discolored paper from oozing liquids on lamella edges for colored spored prints.|$|E
