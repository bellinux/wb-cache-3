5000|$|The {{concept of}} universalism also defines {{distributive}} politics. Universalism refers {{both to the}} broad allocation of benefits to recipients and the wide support these legislative measures receive in Congress. In terms of the people’s <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits,</b> universal distributive policies benefit wide ranges of people and the “unanimous inclusion of representatives’ projects in omnibus-type legislation produced by one committee.” Universalism also points to the legislative support needed to pass these distributive measures and the “coalitions of near-unanimous size rather than coalitions of narrower or minimal winning size” that pass distributive legislation. Universalism has two variants, one broad-based universalism which is more inclusive and the narrow based universalism or universalism among [...] "own" [...] party members or districts ruled by them. The latter kind of universalism is called particularism (see Cox and McCubbins’ universalism‐within‐party hypothesis).Weingast notes that universalism {{should not be taken}} as the sole definition of distributive politics and that “universalism is one principle among many that govern congressional behavior over distributive politics.” Chanchal Kumar Sharma notes that both particularistic and universalistic tendencies {{are a part of the}} game of distributive politics.

5000|$|In May 1999, Kelly Hallisey and Brian Williams, {{two former}} Community Leaders, filed {{a class action}} lawsuit against AOL, {{claiming}} that AOL volunteers performed work equivalent to employees and thus should be compensated according to the Fair Labor Standards Act. [...] The plaintiffs argued that the Community Leader position required {{a significant amount of}} effort and detail to qualify the position as having an [...] "employee relationship" [...] with AOL. The plaintiffs specifically demonstrated how Community Leaders had to undergo a thorough, 3-month training program and were required to file timecards for shifts, work at least four hours per week, and submit detailed reports outlining their work activity during each shift. [...] When AOL first started the program it charged for access to its services by the hour, thus Community Leaders, i.e. those who were heavy Internet users saved hundreds of dollars each month. This fact actually hurt AOL when the lawsuit began, however, as the <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> (along with whether the work is full-time and displaces regular employees) is a factor that helps the Department of Labor determine if a volunteer should actually be paid. The U.S. Department of Labor investigated the report, but came to no conclusions, officially closing the investigation in 2001. In response to the investigation, AOL began drastically reducing volunteer responsibilities. By 2000, nearly all Community Leaders had lost content-editing rights and no longer provided customer service or technical support to AOL customers. Additionally, in many AOL forums, Community Leader supervisors became more lax about paperwork and shift hours.|$|E

For example, special/additional consumption requirements (She and Livermore 2007) or the adoption of active labor market policies can increase the labor supply of disabled people (e.g., Eichhorst et al. 2010). Nevertheless, the income effects related to the <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> disability <b>benefits,</b> the substitution effect deriving from the higher opportunity costs of working {{that are associated with}} disabilities, and lower job-search intensity due to higher mobility costs decrease the labor supply of disabled people. In addition, special time requirements for self-care/rehabilitation activities associated with disability increase the marginal utility of leisure, decreasing the labor supply of disabled people (Mizunoya and Mitra 2013). Finally, from a demand-side perspective, employers {{would be less likely to}} hire disabled people because of their suspected lower productivity, the additional costs of adjusting workplaces to meet disability requirements, and prejudice and/or discrimination.|$|R

It was founded in 1915 by composer and conductor Tadeusz Mazurkiewicz and Gotliba Teschnera, a cello instructor and bookstore owner. The men organized the orchestra initially as a temporary ensemble {{to play for a}} benefit for impoverished musicians. The orchestra was made up of approximately 60 musicians, both professional and amateur. The enthusiastic <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> this <b>benefit</b> concert drew the patronage of industrialist Karol Wilhelm Scheilbler, who provided the finances necessary to make the orchestra a permanent ensemble. Mazurkiewicz was appointed the orchestra's first director. In 1934 the orchestra ceased activities, but resumed performances in 1938. World War II halted concerts again, with performances resuming following the end of the war. The orchestra's current home is the Łódzki Dom Koncertowy, a concert hall built for the orchestra that was inaugurated in 2004. Conductor Lech Dzierżanowski has served as the orchestra's General and Artistic Director since 2007.|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{consequences}} for household economy in connection with unemployment. Various mechanisms that influence the relationship between unemployment and the <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> supplementary <b>benefits</b> are described and analyzed. The labour market, the social insurance system and the adjustment strategies of families are fields {{of particular interest to}} this study. The economic systems of support that have developed are dominated by the unemployment insurance. Those, whose unemployment benefits have ceased or who for some other reason are not covered by the insurance, have to resort to supplementary benefits. The differences in level between working, receiving unemployment benefits or supplementary benefits can be described in terms of a scale of income. The aspect of the scale varies strongly between different types of families. The empirical point of reference for this dissertation is the close-down of a pulp industry (Ncb in Köpmanholmen 130 km south of Umeå in the north of Sweden). The development of those made redundant has been studied with regard to <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> supplementary <b>benefits,</b> income and adjustment strategies. Data about income and supplementary benefits were collected from registers at the local tax charge office and the local administration of social services. 83 out of 444 households were interviewed about adjustment strategies. The close-down in question proved to be exceptional in many aspects. The expected "social catastrophe" never occured due to the economic upswing, raised unemployment benefits and ambitious labour market policy efforts, among other things. Only a very small minority of those made redundant have received supplementary benefits after the close-down. This has been the case although many of those made redundant have been removed from the open labour market with a subsequent lowering of their income level. Amongst those made redundant many different patterns of adjustment havè been observed. It appears that those who lack work {{after a couple of years}} after the close-down are often characterized by passivity, whereas those who have been employed are often characterized by activity. Finally the variation in patterns of adjustment can be seen as a social policy problem. Judging from the results a combination of the institutional and marginal social policy strategies would be desirable. Reform schemes can be suggested that are based on a wish to supplement the preventive and institutional social policy with selective features where the adjustment strategies of families should provide an important resource potential. digitalisering@um...|$|R
40|$|Background: Welfare {{dependence}} and low work participation {{among young people}} have raised concern in many European countries. Reading and writing difficulties (RWD) might make young people vulnerable to work integration problems and welfare dependence through negative influences on education and health. Our main objective {{of this study was}} to examine if RWD in adolescence affected the risk of welfare dependence in young adulthood. Methods: Baseline information on self-reported RWD, health and family was obtained for 8950 school-attending adolescents in Nord-Trøndelag County, Norway, participating in the Young-HUNT 1 survey, 1995 - 97. All individuals were linked to biological parents to identify siblings and parental education from national registers. Welfare dependence was assessed by the <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> social <b>benefits</b> (medical and economic) from the national social insurance database (1998 - 2007). Only long-term benefits (> 180 days) were included. Results: The adolescents who reported RWD at baseline were more likely to receive medical or social benefits during follow-up compared with those who did not report RWD. In girls with RWD, the adjusted 5 -year risk (at age 24 to 28) for receiving medical benefits was 0. 20 (95 % confidence interval 0. 14 - 0. 26), compared with 0. 11 (0. 09 - 0. 12) in girls without RWD.

40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} have been to: 1) describe and compare urban and rural injured worker populations in Alberta, Canada; 2) identify return-to-work outcomes in urban and rural populations; 3) {{examine the relationship between}} geographic location of residence and recovery from work-related musculoskeletal injury; and 4) investigate if this relationship is attenuated after controlling for other known risk factors. Material and Methods: This study was a secondary analysis utilizing data of a population of musculoskeletal injury claimants who underwent clinical/RTW (return to work) assessment between December 2009 and January 2011 collected by the Workers’ Compensation Board of Alberta. Descriptive statistics were computed for 32 variables and used for comparing urban and rural workers. The logistic regression analysis was performed to test the association between geographic location of residence and likelihood of return-to-work. Results: Data on 7843 claimants was included, 70. 1 % of them being urban and 29. 9 % – rural. Rural claimants tended to have spent less time in formal education, have a blue-collar job, have no modified work available, have a diagnosed comorbidity, and not been enrolled in a specialized rehabilitation program. They were 1. 43 (1. 12 – 1. 84) times the odds more likely than urban claimants to be continuing to receive full disability benefits 90 days after their RTW assessment, and 1. 68 (1. 06 – 2. 67) times the odds as likely to report a recurrence <b>of</b> receiving disability <b>benefits.</b> Conclusions: Rural residence was associated with prolonged work disability, even after controlling for age, job type, education level, health utilization and other potential confounders. Further research is required to explore why injured workers in rural settings experience prolonged <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> disability <b>benefits</b> and have greater rates of recurrence <b>of</b> receiving disability <b>benefits.</b> Int J Occup Med Environ Health 2017; 30 (5) : 715 – 72...|$|R

30|$|The party’s social {{insurance}} policy {{is based on}} radical market liberalism and a strict merit system. The employment insurance policy proposed by the party is as follows: unemployment benefit I, which provides {{a certain percentage of}} the previously earned income for 12  months immediately after unemployment, will be linked to the unemployment insurance premium payment leading up to unemployment, and unemployment benefit II, which provides the social benefit necessary for sustenance of livelihood leading up to one’s employment, will be reduced when there is supplementary income (AfD 2016 a: 37; 2017 : 58). The party’s retirement plan is also rooted in the principle <b>of</b> differential insurance <b>benefits</b> that vary depending on one’s degree of contribution (AfD 2017 : 57). What requires attention is the proposal stipulating that <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> normal pension <b>benefits</b> is only possible after working for a minimum of 45  years. With the current legal age for receipt <b>of</b> pension <b>benefits</b> set at 65 to 67  years depending on the year of birth, this could drastically increase the age criterion. Oddly, {{there is no mention of}} occupational health and safety insurance or medical insurance stated in the official materials of the party except for an abstract statement on medical insurance in its 2013 party platform (AfD 2013 : 3). What is even more surprising is that the actual position of the AfD on {{social insurance}} policy can be more “radical” than what is presented in the party platform and the manifestos. According to the draft of the basic doctrine leaked to the press, the AfD was planning on abolishing unemployment benefit I and occupational health and safety insurance entirely (Spiegel Online 2016). The party maintains that unemployment and industrial accidents are extremely personal matters, and that the employer should be held responsible for compensation without help from the state or the corporation. Indeed, in a survey of its own party members, 64.5 % and 53.6 % agreed with the abolition <b>of</b> unemployment <b>benefit</b> I and abolishment of occupational health and safety insurance, respectively (Nocun 2016 : 19).|$|R

40|$|Although much {{research}} has been done in studying physical activity and its health benefits, inactive behaviour has obtained little attention. The main {{purpose of the present study}} is to test the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) in predicting sedentary behaviour to a group of parents with young children and a sedentary job. The secondary purpose of this study is to explore if stress explains additional variation when is entered as an additional variable between intention and sedentary behaviour. The sample consisted of 68 sedentary adults with young children, both men (N = 29) and women (N = 39), (M = 37. 8 years and SD = 5. 8). Participants were divided into two groups: an experimental group who received the intervention and a control group who was not exposed to the intervention but underwent the same measurements. Sedentary behaviour has been assessed with EMG data and calculated to sedentary ratio. Variables of the TPB model (intention, attitude strength, perceived behaviour control, self-identity and perceived knowledge) were assessed by questionnaires. Occupational stress was measured by Heart Rate Variability (HRV) where RMSSD functioned as an indicator for stress. Linear regression analyses indicated that the extended TPB model explained the variance only in the experimental group. Stress has been found to explain larger amount of variation in the control group than in the experimental group. This study shows that the intervention to increase non-exercise physical activity makes people aware of their sedentary behaviour. Also, stress seems to be a factor that interferes between intention and behaviour for sedentary people. Overall, paying attention to diminishing sitting time should be beneficial for public health and increase health outcomes. People need to be aware of the harming effects of their sedentary behaviour and how to increase their non-exercise physical activity in order to be able to make small changes in their everyday routine, ultimately leading to the <b>reception</b> <b>of</b> health <b>benefits</b> elicited from these changes. Moreover, stress management strategies should be included in future interventions, as stress might be seen as a barrier in increasing non-exercise physical activity...|$|R

Speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured for eight cochlear implant (CI) users using consonant and vowel materials under three processing conditions: An omni-directional response, a dipole-directional response, and the spatial-filtering algorithm. The background noise condition used three simultaneous time-reversed speech signals as interferers located at 90 °, 180 °, and 270 °. Results indicated that the spatial-filtering algorithm can provide speech <b>reception</b> <b>benefits</b> <b>of</b> 5. 8 to 10. 7 [*]dB SRT compared to an omni-directional response in a reverberant room with multiple noise sources.

The approach adopted evaluates, {{for the first}} time, the most significant discussions found in previous literature, realising a comprehensive overview of the issues involved. The principles expounded in the theoretical chapters are verified in practice through application to the specific case of Bach’s WTK {{and its role in}} Italy: here, in particular, the thesis dissects the “myth” of Thalberg’s edition and introduces a hitherto overlooked edition by Lanza. Careful comparison of a sample of Italian IEs identifies “genealogies” in performance traditions and their correspondence with the aesthetic trends of their era: the presence of an “Italian” attitude to Bach’s WTK, inspired by prevailing neo-Idealistic values, is shown in the coexistence of a sentimentalist approach with the fascination for structural objectivism. It is demonstrated that musicological studies in aesthetics, performance practice and the history <b>of</b> <b>reception</b> <b>benefit</b> from the analysis of IEs, and from their comparison with other written and recorded documents of performance: IEs are a vehicle for both preserving and transmitting interpretive aesthetics.
