Apolipoprotein A-IV stimulates mucosal CCK release. To investigate the hypothesis that fat-induced release of CCK and apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) is enhanced in the duodenum of FD patients. Sixteen symptomatic FD patients and 10 healthy volunteers (HV) underwent duodenal perfusion with intralipid 20 %, 2 kcal/min, for 60 min. Symptoms were scored and blood samples were collected every 15 min during lipid perfusion and 15 min after discontinuation when duodenal biopsies were taken. Plasma and mucosal concentrations of CCK and apoA-IV were quantified. Abdominal discomfort (P= 0. 001), nausea (P= 0. 05), and fullness (P= 0. 005) in response to duodenal lipid increased significantly only in FD patients. Following lipid infusion, the mean mucosal CCK concentration was lower in FD patients compared with HV (P < 0. 0001).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dyspeptic {{symptoms}} are frequently induced, or exacerbated, by fatty food ingestion. Excessive release of, and/or hypersensitivity to, cholecystokinin (CCK) {{may explain the}} exaggerated response to lipid in patients with functional dyspepsia (FD). Thus far, plasma CCK response has been evaluated. However, stimulation of CCK 1 receptors on duodenal vagal afferents occurs in a paracrine manner, suggesting that mucosal CCK concentrations are relevant to quantify. Apolipoprotein A-IV stimulates mucosal CCK release. AIM: To investigate the hypothesis that fat-induced release of CCK and apolipoprotein A-IV (apoA-IV) is enhanced in the duodenum of FD patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen symptomatic FD patients and 10 healthy volunteers (HV) underwent duodenal perfusion with intralipid 20 %, 2 kcal/min, for 60 min. Symptoms were scored and blood samples were collected every 15 min during lipid perfusion and 15 min after discontinuation when duodenal biopsies were taken. Plasma and mucosal concentrations of CCK and apoA-IV were quantified. RESULTS: Abdominal discomfort (P= 0. 001), nausea (P= 0. 05), and fullness (P= 0. 005) in response to duodenal lipid increased significantly only in FD patients. Following lipid infusion, the mean mucosal CCK concentration was lower in FD patients compared with HV (P< 0. 0001). Fasting concentrations and plasma response of CCK were comparable in FD patients and HV. Plasma apoA-IV response appeared to differ between patients and HV, whereas mucosal apoA-IV concentrations were similar. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest excessive local release of CCK in response to duodenal lipid in FD. This likely causes exaggerated stimulation of duodenal vagal afferents, explaining dyspeptic symptom generation.

40|$|Na(+) -Ca 2 + {{exchange}} {{may play}} a role in Ca 2 + extrusion from the pancreatic B-cell. The characteristics of the process working in its reverse mode were examined in normal rat pancreatic islet cells. Isosmotical replacement of extracellular Na+ by sucrose induced a concentration-dependent increase in 45 Ca uptake, displaying a pharmacological sensitivity compatible with an uptake mediated by Na(+) -Ca 2 + exchange. Glucose, up to 2. 8 mM, stimulated reverse Na(+) -Ca 2 + exchange. Likewise, membrane depolarization activated the process but only under raised intracellular Na+ activity. In conclusion, the B-cell Na(+) -Ca 2 + exchange displays properties similar to those observed in other cells: reversibility and sensitivity to membrane potential. When working in its reverse mode the exchanger displays a quite large capacity. The role played by the exchanger in the process of insulin <b>release</b> <b>warrants</b> further investigation.

40|$|Abstract The {{development}} of obesity {{is becoming an}} international problem {{and the role of}} fructose is unclear. Studies using liver tissue and hepatocytes have contributed to the understanding of fructose metabolism. Excess fructose consumption also affects extra hepatic tissues including adi-pose tissue. The effects of fructose on human adipocytes are not yet fully characterized, although in vivo studies have noted increased adiposity and weight gain in response to fructose sweetened-beverages. In order to understand and predict the metabolic responses of adipocytes to fructose, this study examined differentiating and differentiated human adipocytes in culture, exposed to a range of fructose con-centrations equivalent to that reported in blood after con-suming fructose. A stable isotope based dynamic profiling method using [U- 13 C 6]-D-fructose tracer was used to examine the metabolism and fate of fructose. A targeted stable isotope tracer fate association method was used to analyze metabolic fluxes and flux surrogateswith exposure to escalating fructose concentration. This study demonstrated that fructose stimu-lates anabolic processes in adipocytes robustly, including glutamate and de novo fatty acid synthesis. Furthermore, fructose also augments the release of free palmitate from fully differentiated adipocytes. These results imply that in the presence of fructose, the metabolic response of adipocytes in culture is altered in a dose dependent manner, particularly favoring increased glutamate and fatty acid synthesis and <b>release,</b> <b>warranting</b> further in vivo studies...|$|R
