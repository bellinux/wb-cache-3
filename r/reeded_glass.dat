50|$|The {{collection}} of {{stained glass windows}} of St. Stephen's Church displays a historically significant range of stained glass styles from the 1850s into the early 20th century. Generally, {{the age of the}} windows range from the oldest located in the chancel to the newest located in the vestibule. St. Stephen's has windows ranging from the textured muffle and <b>reeded</b> <b>glass</b> panels of mid-19th century American Gothic windows; to works by J.R. Lamb, a rival of the Tiffany Glass studios; and even comparatively modern windows dated from the 1970s and 80s by Cherry Hill artist F. Paul Skelly.|$|E
500|$|Bono {{conceived}} his [...] "Fly" [...] persona {{during the}} writing of the song of the same name. The character began with Bono wearing an oversized pair of blaxploitation sunglasses, given to him by wardrobe manager Fintan Fitzgerald, to lighten the mood in the studio. Bono wrote the song's lyrics as this character, composing a sequence of [...] "single-line aphorisms". He developed the persona into a leather-clad egomaniac, describing his outfit as having Lou <b>Reed's</b> <b>glasses,</b> Elvis Presley's jacket, and Jim Morrison's leather pants. To match the character's dark fashion, Bono dyed his naturally brown hair black.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>reed</b> {{switches}} use a thin metal [...] "reed" [...] that bends when {{a magnet}} is brought near it; since the entire unit is sealed {{in a glass}} tube, this helps protect the switch from moisture and dust that can damage regular switches.|$|R
50|$|Large steel framed {{windows with}} <b>reeded</b> obscure <b>glass</b> open {{from the front}} elevation. Most of these windows {{comprise}} eight lights with horizontally pivoting sashes to maximise ventilation. Apart from the front entrance, there are a further three doors along {{the front of the}} building. Each entrance is bracketed with fluted pilasters and provided with a shallow concrete step. They are all fitted with double wooden doors and a pair of louvred fanlights above. Each door has a small fixed window near the top.|$|R
50|$|One {{important}} {{quality of}} the switch is its sensitivity, the amount of magnetic field necessary to actuate it. Sensitivity is measured in units of Ampere-turns (AT), corresponding to the current in a test coil multiplied {{by the number of}} turns in the test coil. Typical pull-in sensitivities for commercial devices are in the 10 to 60 AT range. The lower the AT, the more sensitive the reed switch. Also, smaller reed switches, which have smaller parts, are more sensitive to magnetic fields, so the smaller the <b>reed</b> switch's <b>glass</b> envelope is, the more sensitive it is.|$|R
2500|$|... "The Fly" [...] {{made its}} live debut on 29 February 1992 in Lakeland, Florida {{on the opening}} night of the Zoo TV Tour, and it was {{subsequently}} played at every show on the tour. For Zoo TV performances, Bono portrayed his [...] "Fly" [...] alter-ego, which he had developed into a leather-clad egomaniac. He described the character's outfit as having Lou <b>Reed's</b> <b>glasses,</b> Elvis Presley's jacket, and Jim Morrison's leather pants. To match the character's dark fashion, Bono dyed his naturally brown hair black. Bono began each concert as [...] "The Fly" [...] and would continue to play the character {{for most of the}} first half of the concert. In contrast to the earnest Bono of the 1980s, the character strutted around the stage with [...] "swagger and style," [...] exhibiting mannerisms of an egotistical rock star. Bono often stayed in character away from the tour stage, including for public appearances and when staying in hotels. For performances of the song during Zoo TV, the video monitors flashed a rapidly changing array of textual words and aphorisms. Some of these included [...] "Taste is the enemy of art", [...] "Religion is a club", [...] "Ignorance is bliss", [...] "Watch more TV", [...] "Believe" [...] with letters fading out to leave [...] "lie", and [...] "Everything you know is wrong". Describing the visuals, the Edge said, [...] "'The Fly' is information meltdownâ€”text, sayings, truisms, untruisms, oxymorons, soothsayings, etc., all blasted at high speed, just fast enough so it's impossible to actually read what's being said." ...|$|R

50|$|Reed {{was often}} irritated that his {{appearances}} on TV chat shows concentrated on his drinking feats {{rather than his}} latest films and acting career. In September 1975, {{in front of a}} speechless Johnny Carson on The Tonight Show, the bellicose <b>Reed</b> had a <b>glass</b> of whisky poured over his head on-camera by an enraged Shelley Winters (Winters had been upset by Reed's derogatory comments toward women). David Letterman cut to a commercial when Reed became belligerent after being asked too many questions about his drinking during an August 1987 appearance on Late Night with David Letterman.|$|R
50|$|In production, a metal reed is {{inserted}} in {{each end of}} a glass tube {{and the end of}} the tube heated so that it seals around a shank portion on the <b>reed.</b> Green-colored Infrared-absorbing <b>glass</b> is frequently used, so an infrared heat source can concentrate the heat in the small sealing zone of the glass tube. The thermal coefficient of expansion of the glass material and metal parts must be similar to prevent breaking the glass-to-metal seal.The glass used must have a high electrical resistance and must not contain volatile components such as lead oxide and fluorides which can contaminate the contacts during the sealing operation. The leads of the switch must be handled carefully to prevent breaking the glass envelope. The glass envelope can be damaged if the reed switch is subjected to mechanical stress.|$|R
50|$|Some MIDI pedalboards are {{designed}} for the church pipe organ market, {{which means that they}} use AGO specifications such as a 32-note range. Most pipe organ-style MIDI pedalboards are too unwieldy for transportation, so they are typically installed under the upper manuals. However, a German company makes a MIDI pedalboard which has a hinge in the middle and wheels on the underside, which allows it to be moved more easily. Since AGO-specification MIDI pedalboards are often priced in between US$1000 and US$3000, some amateur home organists make DIY MIDI pedalboards by retrofitting an old pedalboard with MIDI. Due to the popularity of theater organs and Hammond organs during the 1950s and 1960s, there are many organ parts on the market, including pedalboards (often with less than 32 notes, such as 20 or 25 notes) which cost under US$300. After the pedalboard is cleaned up and the <b>glass</b> <b>reed</b> switches are repaired or replaced, the pedal contacts are soldered into a keyboard matrix circuit-equipped MIDI encoder, which can then be connected to the MIDI input of a digital sound module to create a bass organ tone.|$|R
40|$|Letter from Nettie Depp to Henry Cherry from Glasgow, Kentucky, August 20, 1910. Transcript of letter: Pres. H. H. Cherry, Bowling Green, Ky. My dear Mr. Cherry, I {{have been}} wating [sic] {{to know for}} certain just what I was to do. I go to Scottsville next week. I have charge of the 7 th and 8 th grades and two higher classes at $ 65. 00 per month. This is not the work I wanted to do nor is it the price I wanted to work for, still I think it the best I can do this year and I shall go and do my best. Please accept my heartfelt thanks for your {{kindness}} in this matter and for the many kindnesses you have shown me since I first entered your institution. We had a nice association last week. Those {{that have been in}} the school there that were in attendance were: Eula Gatewood, Edna Gatewood, Gertrude Underwood, Bessie DeWiese, Nellie Saunders, Chesterfield Turner, Mattie <b>Reed,</b> J. T. <b>Glass,</b> Nettie C. Boles, Zada Smith, my sister and myself. That afternoon I asked Mr. Turner for a few minutes to speak in behalf of the school - of course he gave it to me - I tried to show the people the advantages the school gives and that they should use them as their own. If I only made one person see this {{in such a way that}} he will find his way into the school I shall feel that my little talk was not in vain. I shall send you a list of names that I got that day. Yours for success, Nettie B. Dep...|$|R
