Basic meters utilize a rectifier circuit {{to measure the}} average or peak absolute value of the voltage, but are calibrated to show the calculated <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>square</b> (<b>RMS)</b> value for a sinusoidal waveform; this will give correct readings for alternating current as used in power distribution.

More expensive multimeters include an AC to DC converter that measures the true RMS value of the waveform within certain limits; the user manual for the meter may indicate {{the limits of the}} crest factor and frequency for which the meter calibration is valid.

In this paper, the former is computed as the frequency separation for which the spaced-frequency correlation function falls down to 0.9 [26]. Both magnitudes have a plain relation to the parameters of OFDM communication systems, like the ones currently used in NB-PLC. In particular, distortion in the OFDM signal is avoided if the cyclic prefix {{is larger than the}} length of the channel impulse response. Nevertheless, since increasing the cyclic prefix decreases the symbol rate, its optimum value is usually shorter than the channel impulse response length [27]. The delay spread is a <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>squared</b> (<b>rms)</b> measure of the latter. Hence, the cyclic prefix length should generally be several times larger than the delay spread.|$|R

Here we report friction measurements of several nanostructured surfaces using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). These nanostructured surfaces provide well defined model systems on which we have tested the applicability of Amontons' laws of friction. Our results show that Amontonian behaviour is observed with each of the surfaces studied. However, no correlation has been found between measured friction and various surface roughness parameters such as average surface roughness (R-a) and <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>squared</b> (<b>rms)</b> roughness.

To assess the potential {{magnitude of this}} bias, we introduced random positional error to identical classi � ed images and then subtracted them. False land cover change ranged from less than 5 % for a 5 -class AVHRR classi � cation, to more than 33 % for a 20 -class Landsat TM classi � cation. The potential for false change was higher with more classes. However, false change could not be reliably estimated simply by number of classes, since false change varied signi � cantly by simulation trial when class size remained constant. Registration model <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>squared</b> (<b>rms)</b> error may underestimate the actual image co-registration asccuracy. In simulations with 5 to 50 ground control locations, the mean model rms error was always less than the actual population rms error.

We introduce a bootstrap resampling method to estimate false land cover change due to positional error. Although the bootstrap estimates were unbiased, the precision of the estimates may be too low to be of practical value in some land cover change applications. 1...|$|R

In particular, self-assembled porphyrin devices, including those integrated onto silica and silicon platforms, open new opportunities in photonic applications spanning molecular biosensing, photovoltaics and telecommunications. All reports to date, however, largely highlight the potential but have not established a clear pathway to the actual implementation of more complex device prototypes. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate the use of a focused ion beam (FIB) to process and fabricate devices in porphyrin-based supramolecular structures. These self-assembled structures have an initial <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>squared</b> (<b>rms)</b> values for surface roughness of < 0. 5 nm as measured by atomic force microscopy.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} with XMM-Newton of correlated spectral and timing {{behavior in the}} ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) NGC 5408 X- 1. An ~ 100 ksec pointing with XMM/Newton obtained in January, 2008 reveals a strong 10 mHz QPO in the > 1 keV flux, as well as flat-topped, band limited noise breaking to a power law. The energy spectrum is again dominated by two components, a 0. 16 keV thermal disk and a power-law with an index of ~ 2. 5. These new measurements, combined with results from our previous January 2006 pointing in which we first detected QPOs, show {{for the first time}} in a ULX a pattern of spectral and temporal correlations strongly analogous to that seen in Galactic black hole sources, but at much higher X-ray luminosity and longer characteristic time-scales. We find that the QPO frequency is proportional to the inferred disk flux, while the QPO and broad-band noise amplitude (<b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>squared,</b> <b>rms)</b> are inversely proportional to the disk flux. Assuming that QPO frequency scales inversely with black hole mass at a given power-law spectral index we derive mass estimates using the observed QPO frequency - spectral index relations from five stellar-mass black hole systems with dynamical mass constraints. The results from all sources are consistent with a mass range for NGC 5408 X- 1 from 1000 - 9000 solar masses. Moreover, the recent relation from Gierlinski et al. that relates black hole mass to the strength of variability at high frequencies (above the break in the power spectrum) is also indicative of such a high mass for NGC 5408 X- 1. We argue that these new findings strongly support the conclusion that NGC 5408 X- 1 harbors an intermediate mass black hole. Comment: Accepted for Publication in the Astrophysical Journa...|$|R

Positron emission tomography (PET) of the cerebral glucose metabolism has shown to be useful in the presurgical evaluation of patients with epilepsy. Between seizures, PET images using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) show a decreased glucose metabolism in areas of the gray matter (GM) tissue that are associated with the epileptogenic region. However, detection of subtle hypo-metabolic regions is limited by noise in the projection data and the relatively small thickness of the GM tissue compared to the spatial resolution of the PET system. Therefore, we present an iterative maximum-a-posteriori based reconstruction algorithm, dedicated to the detection of hypo-metabolic regions in FDG-PET images of the brain of epilepsy patients. Anatomical information, derived from magnetic resonance imaging data, and pathophysiological knowledge was included in the reconstruction algorithm. Two Monte Carlo based brain software phantom experiments were used to examine the performance of the algorithm. In the first experiment, we used perfect, and in the second, imperfect anatomical knowledge during the reconstruction process. In both experiments, we measured signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>squared</b> (<b>rms)</b> bias and rms standard deviation. For both experiments, bias was reduced at matched noise levels, when compared to post-smoothed maximum-likelihood expectation-maximization (ML-EM) and maximum a posteriori reconstruction without anatomical priors. The SNR was similar to that of ML-EM with optimal post-smoothing, although the parameters of the prior distributions were not optimized. We can conclude that the use of anatomical information combined with prior information about the underlying pathology is very promising {{for the detection}} of subtle hypo-metabolic regions in the brain of patients with epilepsy. status: publishe...|$|R

30|$|The proper {{choice of}} numerology {{depends on the}} service {{requirements}} of a user {{as well as its}} channel conditions, and it usually results from their interplay. Current 4 G LTE wireless technology provides only a fixed subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz, regardless of the carrier frequency and channel conditions. This is not appropriate for future 5 G systems that will operate over a large spectrum range. One reason is that the channel-induced Doppler spread of the received signal, which causes ICI, as described in [70], scales proportionally with the carrier frequency and the user velocity. Hence, to accommodate higher carrier frequencies and high user mobility without incurring excessive ICI, the subcarrier spacing must be scaled with the carrier frequency and the user velocity. This is especially important in the mmWave band, where even pedestrian speed leads to Doppler shifts of several hundred Hertz. Similarly, it is necessary to adapt the numerology according to the frequency selectivity of the channel. Channels with large <b>root</b> <b>mean</b> <b>squared</b> (<b>rms)</b> delay spread require large CP duration to compensate for ISI, as considered in [71]. There, authors describe the impact of variable CP duration on the capacity performance and find the optimal CP duration over different channel models. Furthermore, the subcarrier spacing for large rms delay spread should be small, to reduce the frequency-domain interpolation error of channel estimation. We show the impact of channel estimation error over different subcarrier spacings in [72], considering doubly selective channels. The optimal choice of numerology, however, is not only determined by this interplay with channel conditions; it also needs to account for the requirements of the considered service. For example, to achieve ultra low-latency for uRLLC services, clearly the transmission time interval length must be reduced, requiring shortening of the symbol duration and, hence, increasing the subcarrier spacing. This implies that perfectly matching the waveform parameters to the channel conditions will not always be possible in practice.|$|R
