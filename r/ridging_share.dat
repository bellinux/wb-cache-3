Well exposed vertical profiles of the sediments were studied along road cuts, erosional channels and cliff drops with special attention focused on their internal physical and biogenic attributes. The facies and facies associations in the lithostratigraphic units mapped include conglomerate, sandstone and claystone. The conglomerate facies is moderately sorted; grain supported and mature, showing evidence of reworking and recycling. Association of this facies with herringbone cross stratified sandstone beds probably indicates tidal channel lag origin. The sandstone facies are commonly compositionally mature, bioturbated and contain clasts of reworked clays and clay drapes and these suggest high energy tidal channels and shoreface. The associated unidirectional cross bedded sandstones subfacies and kaolinitic claystones are interpreted as braided fluvial channels and floodplain deposits. The gross sedimentation pattern and characteristics suggest predominance of trangressive shallow marine processes occasionally incised by fluvial channels.

We point out here that the RT-equality implies that, in the quantum theory on the bulk AdS background which is related to the boundary CFT according to Rehren's 1999 algebraic holography theorem, the entanglement entropy between two complementary bulk Rehren wedges is equal to 1 / 4 G times the (suitably cut off) area of their <b>shared</b> <b>ridge.</b> (This follows because of the geometrical fact that, for complementary ball-shaped regions, the RT minimal surface is precisely the <b>shared</b> <b>ridge</b> of the complementary bulk Rehren wedges which correspond, under Rehren's bulk-wedge to boundary double-cone bijection, to the complementary boundary double-cones whose bases are the RT complementary balls.) This is consistent with the Bianchi-Meyers conjecture [...] that, in a theory of quantum gravity, the entanglement entropy, S, between the degrees of freedom of a given region with those of its complement is S = A/ 4 G (+ lower order terms) [...] but only if the phrase 'degrees of freedom' is replaced by 'matter degrees of freedom'.

Although {{the incorporation of}} the flanking segments into the definitive atrial and ventricular chambers with development is generally accepted now, {{the contribution of the}} outflow tract myocardium to the definitive ventricles remained controversial mainly {{due to the lack of}} appropriate markers. For that reason we performed a detailed study of the pattern of expression of myosin light chain (MLC) 2 a and 2 v by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry during rat and mouse heart development. Expression of MLC 2 a mRNA displays a postero-anterior gradient in the tubular heart. In the embryonic heart it is down-regulated in the ventricular compartment and remains high in the outflow tract, atrioventricular canal, atria and inflow tract myocardium. MLC 2 v is strongly expressed in the ventricular myocardium and distinctly lower in the outflow tract and atrioventricular canal. The co-expression of MLC 2 a and MLC 2 v in the outflow tract and atrioventricular canal, together with the single expression in the atrial (MLC 2 a) and ventricular (MLC 2 v) myocardium, permits the delineation of their boundaries. With development, myocardial cells are observed in the lower endocardial <b>ridges</b> that <b>share</b> MLC 2 a and MLC 2 v expression with the myocardial cells of the outflow tract.

40|$|Redistribution of {{alloying}} elements during tempering {{of a novel}} nanocrystalline steel consisting of a mixture of lower bainitic ferrite and carbon-enriched retained austenite has been analysed by atom probe tomography. Three physical processes, namely redistribution of substitutional solute across the austenite/bainitic ferrite interface before retained austenite decomposition, redistribution of solute across the lower bainite cementite/ferrite interface and the precipitation of transition carbides and cementite, have been observed. Results suggest that retained austenite decomposes during tempering before full equilibrium is reached at the interface.

40|$|The overall aim of my {{dissertation}} was {{to determine}} if subalpine conifers host a consistent core of endophytic bacteria. Endophytic bacteria, symbiotic bacteria found within healthy plant tissue, have been found in all plants studied to date. Endophytic bacteria can influence plant healthy through growth promotion, resistance to pests and pathogens, and confer plasticity to abiotic and biotic stress. Despite the role they can play in plant health, they have largely been examined in agricultural crops with little exploration of endophytic bacteria in long-lived forest trees. Forest trees may rely on bacterial endophytes to confer robustness to variable and environmental conditions they face over their lifetime. Subalpine conifers are long-lived trees that inhabit nutrient limited soils and harsh environments and therefore a good candidate to examine endophytic bacteria that may confer host robustness. In animals, core bacterial symbionts with important roles in host health are often consistently associated with individuals of a host species. To uncover potential beneficial endophytic bacteria, I used next-generation sequencing of the 16 S rRNA bacterial gene to determine if subalpine conifers were host to a consistent core of endophytes. I found Pinus flexilis and Picea engelmannii at Niwot Ridge, CO were consistently dominated by a potential N 2 fixing phylotype (AAB 1). Next, to determine if the consistent AAB 1 association was a result of <b>shared</b> environment (Niwot <b>Ridge)</b> or <b>shared</b> ancestry (Pinus and Picea), I characterized the needle endophytic community of P. flexilis and Pinus contorta at two distance sites: Niwot Ridge, CO and Horseshoe Meadows, CA. I found AAB 1 to dominate the endophytic bacterial communities across both species and sites, suggesting the association was not dependent only on environment but may be a long-term association of AAB 1 and Pinus and Picea. To further examine the distribution of AAB 1 I examined the endophytic community of P. contorta at Tuolumne Meadows, CA. AAB 1 was present but not in high abundance, indicating the AAB 1 association is facultative. I found that the remaining endophyte community (i. e. excluding AAB 1) of P. flexilis, P. engelmanni and P. contorta was structured by geographic location. In contrast to the high elevation pines, a core and consistent endophytic bacteria taxa was not identified in Sequoia sempervirens and Sequoiadendron giganteum in the family Cupressaceae. In these species, the endophyte communities were highly variable within and across tree individuals and species. These results suggest that subalpine conifers in the Pinaceae associate with facultative but symbiotic N 2 fixing endophytic bacteria, and that the symbiosis may have originated after the divergence of Pinaceae and the Cupressaceae...|$|R
40|$|The cranial and postcranial {{anatomy of}} the basal hadrosaurid dinosaur Eotrachodon orientalis, from the {{uppermost}} Santonian of southern Appalachia (southeastern U. S.

E. orientalis possesses a mosaic of plesiomorphic and derived characters {{in the context of}} Hadrosauroidea. Characters shared with basal hadrosauroids include a short and sloping maxillary ectopterygoid shelf, caudally prominent maxillary jugal process, one functional tooth per alveolus on the maxillary occlusal plane, a jugal rostral process with a shallow caudodorsal margin and medioventrally facing articular facet, a vertical dentary coronoid process with a poorly expanded apex, and tooth crowns with accessory <b>ridges.</b> Derived characters <b>shared</b> with other hadrosaurids include a circumnarial depression compartmented into three fossae (as in brachylophosaurins and Edmontosaurus), a thin everted premaxillary oral margin (as in Gryposaurus, Prosaurolophus, and Saurolophus), and a maxilla with a deep and rostrocaudally extensive rostrodorsal region with a steeply sloping premaxillary margin (as in Gryposaurus). Eotrachodon orientalis differs primarily from the other hadrosauroid from the Mooreville Chalk of Alabama, Lophorhothon atopus, in having a slender and crestless nasal whose caudodorsal margin is not invaded by the circumnarial depression. Hadrosaurus foulkii, the only other known hadrosaurid from Appalachia, is distinct from E. orientalis in having dentary teeth lacking accessory ridges and a dorsally curved shaft of the ischium. A histological section of the tibia of the E. orientalis holotype (MSC 7949) suggests that this individual was actively growing at the time of death and, thus, had the potential to become a larger animal later in development...|$|R
40|$|Se {{describe}} una construcción estromatolítica de 15 m de potencia y 60 m de diámetro hallada entre margas y pelitas de la Formación Los Molles, en el suroeste de la Cuenca Neuquina (Argentina). Este biohermo, de edad jurásica temprana, está constituido por estromatolitos individuales de escala métrica con morfologías variadas, a los que se asocian facies de tubos de gusanos calcáreos. Otros restos orgánicos son sumamente raros, e incluyen amonites, ostrácodos, gasterópodos, bioclastos y restos vegetales carbonosos. Facies de micritas peloidales laminadas son menos frecuentes. La laminación estromatolítica está constituida por láminas micríticas y peloidales sobre las que crecieron cementos fibrosos y botroidales tempranos. El biohermo constituye una acumulación carbonática anómala formada en una cuenca silicoclástica, en ambiente marino relativamente profundo y de baja energía. Sobre la base de criterios sedimentológicos y biológicos se ha interpretado el biohermo como formado por debajo del nivel del oleaje de tormenta, en aguas poco oxigenadas, y dentro del límite de la zona fótica. Por sus características, asociación de facies y semejanzas con ejemplos referidos en la literatura, se propone un modelo que relaciona este biohermo con la surgencia submarina de aguas profundas a través de las fallas limitantes de depocentros del sin-rift, someramente enterrados bajo los materiales aquí descriptos. El origen de estos fluidos podría estar relacionado con los fenómenos magmáticos e hidrotermales asociados al relleno sin-rift de la cuenca, que incluye abundantes rocas volcánicas y piroclásticas. Otro posible origen se relacionaría con la potencial presencia de acumulaciones de hidrocarburos en el subsuelo durante el Jurásico, en un modelo similar al de otros ejemplos fósiles y actuales. A stromatolitic bioherm {{embedded in}} deep-water shales and marls of the Los Molles Formation {{was found in}} the SW of the Neuquén Basin (Argentina). The Neuquén Basin is located in west Central Argentina and eastern Chile, between 36 - 40 º LS. It was formed in the late Triassic by continental extension and evolved as a backarc basin from the Middle Jurassic. It was infilled by an Upper Triassic to Early Tertiary succession of marine and continental deposits included in different sedimentary cycles, formed in response to relative sea level variations and tectonic pulses. The Los Molles Formation was deposited in response to the first marine transgression in the Neuquén Basin in the Early Jurassic. It is made up of dark shales, silts and sandstone turbidites. It overlies shallow marine clastic and carbonate deposits of Pliensbachian age (Chachil and Sierra de Chacaico formations), and it is overlain by tidal clastic deposits of Bajocian age (Lajas Formation). A series of Late Triassic synrift depocentres were shallowly buried under these units in the studied area, which also unconformably overly Paleozoic granitic or metamorphic basement (Fig. 1). The described stromatolitic bioherm is located to the SW of the locality of Zapala, in southern Neuquén, {{in the area of the}} Sierra de Chacaico (Fig. 1). It is 15 m thick and 60 m in diameter, and made up by individual stromatolites averaging 2 meters across and 1. 5 m high (Fig. 2). They show variable geometries, including tabular and columnar shapes in the lower, micrite-rich, part of the buildup, and domed shapes in the upper, cement-dominated, part. These individual stromatolites form a discrete bioherm, wrapped as a whole by an outer coating of laminations which locally shows very steep to vertical margins (Fig. 2 b). The individual stromatolites are made up of encased laminated calcitic layers, locally oversteepened, vertical or even overturned (Fig. 3 a). The microscropic structure shows the bulk of the lamination consisting of thin micritic laminae or peloids cemented by early fibrous and botryoidal cements growing centripetally. Locally associated clusters of tube-like worm communities are embedded in peloidal micritic sediment. Other biota includes ammonites and very rare ostracods, gastropods and bioclasts. The depositional environment deduced for this build-up is a low energy marine setting, bellow the storm wave base, and in the limit or slightly above the photic zone, in poorly oxygenated waters. This environment is deduced from the lack of phototrophic organisms, no sedimentary structures indicating current action, preservation of lamination, lack of bioturbation, and thriving opportunistic faunas, characteristic of oxygen-depleted environments in associated facies. Depositional depths for shaly-silty facies of the Los Molles Formation in the upper, regressive part of the section, where these facies interfinger laterally with tidal sandstones of the Lajas Formation, has been estimated in base to clinoform reliefs in at least 40 meters. Minimal depositional depth for the stromatolitic bioherm is estimated to be about 50 m, and it was likely between 50 - 100 m. Carbonate deposits analogous to the one described in this work have been found in deep water environments associated to cold seeps in subduction zones or oceanic <b>ridges.</b> These structures <b>share</b> many of their characteristics with the described buildup, as are being an anomalous carbonate accumulation in a relatively deep siliciclastic basin, the scale, the low diversity-high abundance faunas, and depositional facies as tube worms and bacterially induced lamination. What makes this example unique is the presence of stromatolites, which have not been described in other analogous localities. Differences between this example and hydrothermal vent deposits are the lack of associated ore deposits and mineralization, and the absence of chemosynthetic bivalves, non light-dependant faunas common in some hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. These communities form in association to sea-floor vents or seeps which reach the surface through faults or porous beds. In a similar context, this buildup is interpreted as associated to a sea floor vent in the Jurassic sea-floor of the Neuquén Basin. Given the location of the bioherm over the margin of one of the shallowly buried syn-rift depocentres, migration of the fluids could have followed its bounding faults. This depocentre is infilled by continental, volcanic, and pyroclastic rocks, and the origin of the fluids could be related to the magmatic and hydrothermal activity associated with the emplacement of these deposits during rift stages, shortly before deposition of the Los Molles Formation. On the other hand, some examples are known from deepwater communities formed in relation to cold seeps which origin is related to subsurface hydrocarbon accumulations (Gulf of Mexico, Greenland). The importance of hydrocarbon accumulations in the syn-rift succession of the Neuquén Basin is being gradually acknowledged, and the deposition of this bioherm could indicate the presence of subsurface hydrocarbons during the Jurassic in the Neuquén Basin. Future isotopic analysis will help to evaluate this model and decide on the origin of this unique structure...|$|R
