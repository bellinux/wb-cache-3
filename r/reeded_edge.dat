25|$|A set of five {{unauthorised}} 'fantasy' Lundy Puffin coins {{were put}} on sale in 2011. These five coins are dated 2011 and are in the Puffin denominations, ranging from half, one, two, four to six. Only half and one Puffin coins have been issued in the past. They carry the same edge inscription as the original coins and the same portrait of Martin Coles Harman. The half and one Puffin are in a copper appearance, the two and four are in a brass appearance and the six Puffins is silver coloured. The half and one are unchanged, whilst the two has two puffins flying, the four a Lundy lighthouse, and the six has Tresco Castle on the reverse. The six puffin coin has a <b>reeded</b> <b>edge</b> and is crown size. The quality of these coins is surprisingly high.|$|E

5000|$|In numismatics, <b>reeded</b> <b>edges</b> {{are often}} {{referred}} to as [...] "ridged" [...] or [...] "grooved" [...] (US usage), or [...] "milled" [...] (UK usage). Some coins, such as United States quarters and dimes, 1 euro, Australian 5, 10, 20 cents, 1 and 2 dollars, as well many other current coins, have <b>reeded</b> <b>edges.</b> One reason for having <b>reeded</b> <b>edges</b> was to prevent counterfeiting. Some gold and silver coins were reeded to discourage scraping off the precious metals {{from the edge of the}} coin, to maintain its stated value in precious metal. [...] Another benefit of certain coins having <b>reeded</b> <b>edges</b> is that it helps enable different coin denominations to be easily identified and distinguished from each other by sense of touch alone.|$|R

500|$|Criminals soon {{realized}} that the new nickel, which lacked the word [...] "CENTS", was close in size to the five-dollar gold piece, {{and if they were}} to plate the nickel with gold, it might be passed for five dollars. Some coins were even given a <b>reeded</b> <b>edge</b> by fraudsters, making them appear more like the gold coins. The Mint halted production of the new coins; production of Shield nickels continued. Barber was told to modify his work, which he did, moving other design elements to accommodate the word [...] "CENTS" [...] {{at the bottom of the}} reverse. The revised nickel was issued on June 26, 1883, the date on which production of the Shield nickel was finally stopped. The public promptly hoarded the [...] "centless" [...] nickels, believing the Treasury Department intended to recall them, and that they would become rare.|$|E
500|$|It had {{not been}} thought {{necessary}} to inscribe the word [...] "cents" [...] on the nickel; the silver and copper-nickel three-cent pieces had circulated for years with only a Roman numeral to indicate the denomination. [...] Enterprising fraudsters soon realized that the new nickel was close in diameter {{to that of the}} five-dollar gold piece, and if the new coin was gold-plated, it might be passed for five dollars. [...] They soon did so, and had success in passing the coin. Some coins were given a <b>reeded</b> <b>edge</b> by the fraudsters, to make them appear more like the gold coins. [...] A widespread tale {{is that one of the}} perpetrators of this fraud was a man named Josh Tatum, who would go into a store, select an item costing five cents or less, and offer the gold-plated piece in payment—and many clerks gave him $4.95 in change. [...] According to the tale, the law had no recourse against Tatum, as he had tendered the value of his purchase and had merely accepted the change as a gift. By some accounts, Tatum could not have misrepresented the value of the coin as he was a deaf-mute.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} microclimate (surface and air temperature, humidity, light and wind intensity) and vegetation structure (density and height of reeds, and reed shoot structure) across the first 20 m of a sharp <b>reedbed</b> <b>edge</b> at Lake Velence, Hungary, in June 1996. There was a significant edge effect, although different variables contributed differently to the pattern. The <b>reedbed</b> <b>edge</b> had three bands: the first is characterised by very dense stand, where the shoots were thin and short; in the second band density declined, but reed shoots were thick and very high, and in the third band both density and height declined, but not shoot diameter. Microclimate variables showed similar pattern: <b>reedbed</b> <b>edges</b> were warm, dry, bright and windy, further inside temperature, light and wind intensity declined, humidity increased, and still further temperature and light intensity increased, and humidity decreased. I estimated that the edge effect penetrates into the reedbed up to ca. 15 m. The great variation of variables across the edge inevitable has significant impact on the occurrence of animals species; our knowledge, however, is too limited to predict the expected extinction of species owing to edge effect...|$|R

40|$|Predation is a {{major cause}} of nest failure in many bird species. High levels of nest loss may be a {{consequence}} of habitat fragmentation, leading to increased amounts of edge habitat. Yet the evidence for generally high nest predation rates along edges in fragmented landscapes is ambiguous. Using real nests of Reed Buntings Emberiza schoeniclus in which artificial Reed Bunting and real Japanese Quail Coturnix japonica eggs were placed, we experimentally tested for edge effects on nest predation in highly fragmented reed Phragmites sp. habitats in the Swiss lowlands. We also examined seasonal patterns of predation and the impacts of nest visits by observers. We found evidence for an edge effect at the water-sided <b>reed</b> <b>edge,</b> with nests located closer to the water being more likely to be predated than those further away. Predation probability increased from early to late season, suggesting that nest predation may be density dependent. Probability of nest predation was only weakly influenced by whether or not a nest was visited. Our results suggest that the intensive reed management currently applied in Swiss nature reserves may result in unnaturally high levels of nest losses in the Reed Bunting, because reed bands are not wide enough to allow nest placement at a safe distance from <b>reed</b> <b>edges...</b>|$|R

2500|$|In Gresham's day, bad money {{included}} any coin {{that had}} been debased. Debasement was often done by the issuing body, where less than the officially specified amount of precious metal was contained in an issue of coinage, usually by alloying it with a base metal. [...] The public could also debase coins, usually by clipping or scraping off small portions of the precious metal, also known as [...] "stemming" [...] (<b>reeded</b> <b>edges</b> on coins were intended to make clipping evident). Other examples of bad money include counterfeit coins made from base metal. Today all circulating coins are made from base metals, known as fiat money.|$|R
2500|$|Circulating coins {{commonly}} {{suffered from}} [...] "shaving" [...] or [...] "clipping": {{the public would}} cut off small amounts of precious metal from their edges to sell it and then pass on the mutilated coins at full value. Unmilled British sterling silver coins were sometimes reduced to almost half their minted weight. This form of debasement in Tudor England was commented on by Sir Thomas Gresham, whose name was later attached to Gresham's law. The monarch would have to periodically recall circulating coins, paying only the bullion value of the silver, and reminting them. This, also known as recoinage, is a long and difficult process that was done only occasionally. Many coins have milled or <b>reeded</b> <b>edges,</b> originally designed {{to make it easier}} to detect clipping.|$|R
5000|$|Except for the 50 {{cents and}} 1 dollar pieces, {{all of these}} coins are the same size, weight, and {{composition}} as the corresponding Australian coins, with the 1 and 2 cent pieces composed of bronze and the 5, 10, 20, 50, and $1 being composed of cupro-nickel. As usual for other pacific island states, only the lower denominations (1-20 cent) share any commonality, with the largest denominations being unique to their respective countries. The 50 cent piece is round with <b>reeded</b> <b>edges,</b> unlike the dodecagonal (twelve sided) Australian equivalent. The Kiribati 1 dollar is the same twelve sided shape as the Australian 50 cent coin, but it is smaller and weighs about 4½ grams less than both the Australian and Kiribati half dollars.|$|R
50|$|This {{design was}} more {{successful}} {{and it was}} continued into 1796. In 1795, planchets became too thin for the edge lettering because of a weight reduction, so the mint stopped edge lettering on the cent, {{and the rest of}} these coins were made with a plain edge. Four coins from 1795 are known to have a <b>reeded</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The fifty-cent coin {{was first}} {{introduced}} as a [...]900 purity silver half dollar in 1866.

One bank of the brook has been left with <b>reed</b> <b>edges,</b> to minimise the disturbance to wildlife, and artificial sand cliffs have been established where those used by nesting sand martins had to be removed as part of the engineering works. In addition to use by boats, a primary aim of the project was to create a feature which could be enjoyed and used by walkers, cyclists and fishermen*(See comment above, fishing is not allowed on the Millennium Ribble Link). To add interest to such use, an arts sculpture trail has been created running the length of the development with a number of sculptures on view.

40|$|Many species {{persist in}} {{fragmented}} populations {{as a consequence}} of past and ongoing habitat destruction. Despite this, the importance of remnant fragments varying in size for the conservation of species is often unclear. From 2002 to 2006, we studied the role of small and large wetland fragments (2 – 247 ha) within a 200 km 2 area in northeastern Switzerland for the persistence of the Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus, a characteristic species of wetlands. Results from both artificial nest experiments and real nests showed that nest success increased with vegetation cover around and above the nest, distance from the water-sided <b>reed</b> <b>edge,</b> {{and to a lesser extent}} also with distance from the land-sided <b>reed</b> <b>edge,</b> and the size and shape (expressed as the ratio between edge length and area of the patch) of the reed patch containing the nest. These findings suggest that nest success of the Reed Bunting fundamentally depends on the quality of the reed patches: large and old reed patches with dense vegetation are habitats of good quality and conducive to nest success, whereas young and small patches, such as one-year-old reed stripes («rotational fallows»), are suboptimal habitats. Probability of nest predation was not related to whether or not a nest was visited by observers. Reproductive performance of the Reed Bunting in small and large wetland fragments did not basically differ, although small fragments were better reproductive grounds in one of four years. Recruitment probability, defined as probability that individuals born and ringed in our study area were re-sighted as breeders in a subsequent year, was not related to fragment size either. Based on demographic and population genetic analyses, the local populations in the different fragments were strongly connected, thus forming a patchy population (and not a metapopulation, despite the fragmented distribution). Small and large fragments turned out to be mostly sinks, and the annual growth rate of the entire population network was insufficient for selfmaintenance. Both findings imply that the persistence of the local populations and of the entire patchy population depended on immigration, which was found to annually range from 43, 8 to 61, 4 %. We conclude from this study that small and large wetland fragments contributed equally to the population network of the Reed Bunting in northeastern Switzerland, even though they have to be considered as sinks from a demographic perspective. For the conservation of the Reed Bunting, future management of wetlands should aim at sparing large reed patches along the water’s edge to provide adequate nest sites...|$|R
