40|$|Land {{clearing}} for dryland agriculture {{has altered}} landscape water balance and {{is associated with}} severe valley-floor secondary dryland salinity within parts of Australia, South-East Asia, Africa, North and South America. The pervasive hydrologic process-response model is termed the “hillslope recharge-discharge model” (HRD Model), and attributes salinisation to increased hillslope recharge and rising groundwater tables resulting from reduced evapotranspiration potential following land clearing. New research suggests that internal redistribution of surface water from moderately-sloped hillslopes onto low-gradient broad valley floors, termed the “shedding-receiving model”, may be a significant additional salinisation mechanism and alternative management strategies may be required. A meso-scale surface water gauging network and four valley floor surface water-groundwater interaction sites were established in the Toolibin Lake catchment in southwestern Australia. Based on two years of data, we confirm that the shedding-receiving model holds in this landscape, operating {{in combination with the}} pervasive HRD model. There is significant rainfall runoff from moderately sloped uplands, onto low gradient valley floors and high transmission losses result from top-down preferential pathway recharge after the break of season.

It questions the definition of 'custom' implicit in this trend, while exposing and rejecting attempts to use Maitland's work to drive a wedge between legally- and sociologically-informed approaches to court rolls.;Computer-based analysis is applied to 316 sessions between 1327 and 1377 of the halimotes, leet, curia and hundred courts of Wisbech, Elm, Leverington, Newton and Tydd St. Giles. These vills were under the single lordship of the bishop of Ely, whose fourteenth-century privileges and jurisdictions are here defined.;Court rolls are taken to record court roles (juror, essoin etc.) and these are defined in detail as attributes of individuals, whose activities and interactions are thus considered strictly within the arena of the court.

Rudimentary social network analysis is undertaken, proving more useful as an interpretative mode than a mathematical technique. Narrative case-studies relate individuals and families to observed trends.;Finally, a refinement of existing methodologies is offered. It is suggested that, although social historians should indeed be sensitive to the limited purposes of these records, they need not abandon social reconstruction. Rather, the nature and dynamics of individuals' 'court-lives' should be defined with detailed reference to local custom and circumstances. This done, other classes of records can be utilised, each to illuminate its own aspect of individual lives. 'Identity' is advanced as a theoretical basis for keeping these lines of investigation separate until their combination in social reconstruction reflective of the multifaceted nature of society...|$|R

Furthermore, this paper will measure success with the help of the intentions the game producers had while creating the game. There are two key intentions that will be closely taken into account while answering this question. Firstly, reaching a young audience with the help of the Teen rating and secondly informing the public about the military. In order to measure the success here, this paper will analyse statistics about the amount of downloads the game received. An analysis of how the game effectively informs the public about the military will be conducted to further understand the dynamics of the new recruitment device. Comparison and components of analysis of other commercialised video games that are deemed to be the most popular ones in the video game industry will then further establish whether the army managed to create a game that fulfils the standards that effectively lead to a big audience of players...|$|R
