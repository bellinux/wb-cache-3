40|$|Convenient {{methods for}} the <b>rapid,</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>synthesis</b> of {{diversely}} functionalized nanoparticles will enable discovery of novel formulations for drug delivery, biological imaging, and supported catalysis. In this report, we demonstrate parallel synthesis of brush-arm star polymer (BASP) nanoparticles by the "brush-first" method. In this method, a norbornene-terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) macromonomer (PEG-MM) is first polymerized via ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) {{to generate a}} living brush macroinitiator. Aliquots of this initiator stock solution are added to vials that contain varied amounts of a photodegradable bis-norbornene crosslinker. Exposure to crosslinker initiates a series of kinetically-controlled brush+brush and star+star coupling reactions that ultimately yields BASPs with cores comprised of the crosslinker and coronas comprised of PEG. The final BASP size depends {{on the amount of}} crosslinker added. We carry out the synthesis of three BASPs on the benchtop with no special precautions to remove air and moisture. The samples are characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC); results agreed closely with our previous report that utilized inert (glovebox) conditions. Key practical features, advantages, and potential disadvantages of the brush-first method are discussed. Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

40|$|Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) are {{essential}} enzymes {{present in all}} living organisms, their catalytic activity {{is involved in the}} translation of the genetic code into functional proteins and they are potential targets for anti-infective agents. The first step in the biosynthetic pathway catalysed by aaRSs consists of activation of the corresponding amino acid by the reaction with ATP to form an aminoacyl-adenylate (aa-AMP), the key intermediate in the biosynthesis of proteins. As a result stable, analogues of aa-AMP have been identified as potential and valuable lead compounds for the development of potential aaRS inhibitors. This thesis describes the design and synthesis of potential aaRSs inhibitors. The studies involve the development of a novel solution-phase synthetic route to non-hydrolysable sulfamoyl-based aa-AMP analogues. Synthesis includes the development of a protective group strategy that utilises global deprotection under neutral conditions to minimise by-product formation. Optimal reaction conditions for the coupling of different amino acids to the sulfamoyl moiety have also been investigated. A solid-phase synthetic route leading to non-hydrolysable sulfamoyl-based aa-AMP analogues has also been developed. The novel synthetic route enables the possibility for <b>rapid</b> <b>parallel</b> <b>synthesis</b> of structurally diverse compounds in quantities sufficient for biological evaluation. Molecular modelling techniques have been used to gain understanding about the structure–activity relationship of the inhibitors of aaRSs based on non-hydrolysable aa-AMP analogues. A model ligand adopting the putative bioactive conformation was identified based on X-ray data and conformational searches. Novel phosphate bioisosteres of aa-AMP have been designed using the derived model. Molecular docking techniques were used for the design of ribose-free purine-based aa-AMP bioisosteres. The designed compounds were synthesised and evaluated biologically in an assay using aaRS isolated from Escherichia coli. A novel mild method for the activation and recycling of a tritylated solid-phase resin has also been developed. Recycling of recovered resin after the completion of a reaction is considered beneficial since it minimises the associated costs and is environmentally friendly. The method was used for the attachment of primary and secondary alcohols, halogen-containing alcohols and anilines to trityl resin...|$|E

In this screening phase, over 150 copper based-catalysts have been tested in 2 month. The copper based-catalysts used in the screening were prepared using slurry method at high metal loading. All results from the screening were combined in Access database and analyzed using Spotfire software.

The solid phase synthesis offers benefit of easy and fast purification to separate excess reagents and side products from the desired compounds attached to the insoluble carrier.

More recently, <b>parallel</b> <b>synthesis</b> is applied to generate libraries of inorganic materials. In addition to <b>parallel</b> <b>synthesis</b> techniques obtaining large amounts of new materials in the quest for new, interesting, ones, combinatorial or HTP screening is growing rapidly in its application to optimize the composition of materials to obtain specific physical or chemical properties and (fundamentally) understand their origin. In this study we have applied the HTP screening approach to understand and optimise/fine-tune the colouristic properties of inorganic pigments based upon mixed metal oxides. The chemical and physical properties of these pigments are strongly dependent on their structure and the location and distribution of cations in their structure. The structure and cation distribution in itself is strongly dependent on the pre-treatment procedure, with the temperature being the most important factor. Screening during synthesis will allow us to understand and optimise the synthesis and (pre) treatment process.
