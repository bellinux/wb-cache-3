5000|$|On 8 July 1952 she was lent to the French Navy, who {{named her}} La Sibylle. She was in service briefly, for just 11 weeks, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant de Vaisseau Gustave CUROT, being lost in the Mediterranean with her crew of 47 on 24 September 1952, at a depth of 700 m off Cape Camarat (on the St Tropez {{peninsula}} in the Var). During exercises with the escort-vessel [...] "Touareg" [...] she was at minimum depth of 30 metres, changing course by 30° every 10 minutes. Having dived at 0743, [...] "La Sibylle" [...] was attacked for a first time at 0752. During a second attack, ASDIC contact was lost at 0802 at 270 m distance, just before the [...] "Touareg" [...] was vertically above her. Contact was never regained, The submarine's buoy was seen at 0815, probably because the buoyancy of the buoy broke its <b>retaining</b> <b>cable</b> when the submarine was crushed by the sea pressure on the hull. No external collision, explosion or other noises (such as that of blowing main ballast) were detected by [...] "Touareg" [...] or by the submarine [...] "Laubie" [...] patrolling in a neighbouring sector. No mention was made of any practise depth charges which might have been fired by the [...] "Touareg", nor of any break-up noises of crushing at depth (which would have occurred long before [...] "La Sibylle" [...] reached the bottom at 700 m).|$|E
40|$|The drive has a {{liftable}} {{driven wheel}} (3), which {{is associated with}} a wheeled frame (2) supporting the robot or the vehicle. The driven wheel is made of a material with a high coefficient of friction in the travel direction. The remaining wheels (4) made from a material with a lower coefficient of friction. The frame is held by a <b>retaining</b> <b>cable</b> wound around a pair of spaced cable drums (9). The sidewards movement or angular position of the frame relative to the travel direction is detected for operating the drum drives (10), under control of a position correction device. USE - For displacement of cleaning robot across surface of glass building. Surface may be smooth, inclined or curved. ADVANTAGE - Easily maintains correct alignment of robot or vehicle frame with travel direction. Vehicle moves forwards without disruption...|$|E
40|$|Simple repair {{technique}} <b>retains</b> <b>cable</b> characteristic impedance. Shielded-Cable Splicing Technique <b>retains</b> <b>cable</b> characteristic impedance. Procedure involves splicing inner conductors in staggered pattern, installing jumper braid by heat-shrinking two solder sleeves, {{and placing}} insulation sleeve over repaired section and heat-shrinking it. Two possible insulation materials are modified polyvinylidene fluoride and polytetrafluoroethylene...|$|R
50|$|With the win, the Raiders {{finish the}} season with an 8-8 record, but {{not good enough to}} <b>retain</b> Tom <b>Cable</b> as head coach. Not long after the regular season ended, the Raiders chose not to {{exercise}} their option to <b>retain</b> <b>Cable,</b> thus he was released from the Raider organization.|$|R
50|$|On July 17, 2012, the CRTC {{approved}} the CBC's plans {{to close down}} all repeaters, including CBEFT, by August 1, 2012. Their licenses were revoked at CBC's request. As CBC <b>retained</b> valuable <b>cable</b> television slots in all communities which it had abandoned over-the-air, the network claims that {{only a minority of}} viewers have completely lost the signal.|$|R
50|$|In {{the absence}} of {{upgrades}} beyond its initial bandwidth, JASURAUS saw minimal further use. Its remaining years were spent largely idle, with the <b>cable</b> <b>retained</b> as a backup link out of Australia and as an additional source of connectivity for AARNet.|$|R
2500|$|In British energy law {{and real}} {{property}} law, a wayleave {{is a type}} of easement used by a utility that allows a linesman to enter the premises, [...] "to install and <b>retain</b> their <b>cabling</b> or piping across private land in return for annual payments to the landowner." [...] Like a license or profit-à-prendre, [...] " [...] Wayleave is normally a temporary arrangement and does not automatically transfer to a new owner or occupier." [...] More generally, a wayleave agreement can be used for any service provider.|$|R
40|$|The {{description}} {{refers to}} a device {{for the production of}} cable harnesses, comprising a routing board to which routing aids, such as plug housing fixtures, routing aids, etc. which <b>retain</b> the <b>cable</b> during the assembly of the cable harness, can be attached. The invention is characterized by the fact that an ejecting or stripping plate is arranged on the front side of the routing baord, said plate being movable for ejecting the cable harness from the routing board, and that the routing aids can be attached to the routing board by means of recesses in the ejecting plate...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the post-war}} era, the {{introduction}} of [...] "safety bindings" [...] replaced the toe plate with more complex auto-release systems, while <b>retaining</b> the heel <b>cable</b> to keep the boot against the toe binding. Over time, the heel cable was replaced with new clip-on binding designs, starting in the late 1950s. By the late 1960s, bear-trap bindings had largely disappeared from the alpine skiing world.|$|R
50|$|A space {{elevator}} cable {{would need}} to carry its own weight {{as well as the}} additional weight of climbers. The required strength of the cable would vary along its length. This is because at various points it would have to carry the weight of the cable below, or provide a downward force to <b>retain</b> the <b>cable</b> and counterweight above. Maximum tension on a space elevator cable would be at geosynchronous altitude so the cable would have to be thickest there and taper carefully as it approaches Earth. Any potential cable design may be characterized by the taper factor - the ratio between the cable's radius at geosynchronous altitude and at the Earth's surface.|$|R
25|$|Time Warner <b>retained</b> Time Warner <b>Cable</b> as a {{subsidiary}} until March 2009, {{when it was}} spun out as an independent company. Prior to the spin-out, Time Warner had held an 84% stake in Time Warner Cable. Non-Time Warner shareholders received 0.083670 shares for each share already owned. This move made Time Warner Cable the largest cable operator in the United States owned solely by a single class of shareholders (without supervoting stock).|$|R
5000|$|Cable's first {{coach at}} Perth was former [...] premiership captain Ern Henfry, who alerted the Blues about the talented young rover. So in 1964, Carlton invited Cable to Melbourne and signed {{him on a}} “Form Four”, which meant that {{for the next two}} seasons he was tied to Carlton if he were to play in Victoria. But Cable had no desire to move interstate, despite the {{repeated}} urging from Carlton. During the following three seasons, Perth president Cliff Houghton forbade Cable from negotiating with VFL clubs, and when on 6 July 1969 this ban was lifted and Cable spoke with [...] he did not decide to move. It was not until [...] secretary Ron Joseph flew over to Perth and met with Cable personally in 1969 that Cable decided to play in Victoria. In August of that year, Cable signed a form four with the North Melbourne Football Club, enabling him to transfer to the Victorian Football League (VFL). The secretary of North Melbourne, Ron Joseph, said Cable was “genuinely interested in playing League football”, and wanted to [...] "prove himself in Victorian football”. At the time Cable made his initial move to Victoria, [...] were a struggling team, still a few years away from becoming one of the powerhouses of the decade. 1970 was a miserable year for the Kangaroos as they finished last on the ladder, but Cable justified the hype over his reputation by winning the Syd Barker Medal and finishing fourth in the Brownlow Medal vote count. However, North Melbourne were unable to meet a clause in his contract, which required them to pay Perth $71,000 to <b>retain</b> <b>Cable’s</b> services. This was a large sum, especially in the days when being a VFL footballer was not a full-time profession as it would become in later decades. As a result, Cable returned to Western Australia.|$|R
50|$|Lapham {{was subject}} to the first recall attempt in city history due to his {{increasing}} of streetcar fares in July 1946. Lapham himself signed the recall petition and urged others to sign it to bring the issue to a vote. The recall was fought by all four daily newspapers and failed by 32,000 votes at a special election. In 1947 he attempted to scrap the city's cable car system, claiming it was too expensive. This idea was abandoned {{in the face of}} protests, led by Friedel Klussmann, and the city <b>retains</b> the <b>cable</b> cars to this day. Lapham also presided over the founding of the United Nations at the first meeting of the United Nations Conference on International Organization, in April 1945. The meetings were held at the War Memorial Opera House.|$|R
5000|$|Botrill's {{patented}} wheels {{were also}} used on [...] "Big Lizzie", a huge traction engine which McDonald's built to his design in 1915. Big Lizzie could carry almost 90 tons when two trailers were attached.There were just six bearers on each wheel, compared to Bottril's earlier designs which had as many as twelve bearers. This placed more strain on the <b>cables</b> <b>retaining</b> the bearers, and {{had the effect of}} reducing the tractor's speed to one mile per hour. Big Lizzie was awkward to manoeuvre, with a turning radius of 200 ft.|$|R
50|$|ClearCurve fibers are {{constructed}} {{in a fashion}} similar to existing cables, starting with a traditional glass fiber in the center. ClearCurve then adds a third layer to the sandwich, a plastic sheath that is infused with microscopic reflectors. Light that passes through the conventional interface has {{a second chance to}} be reflected back {{into the center of the}} fiber. In the corners of tight bends, the reflectors serve to increase the amount of signal <b>retained</b> within the <b>cable,</b> allowing ClearCurve to be hundreds of times more flexible than conventional cables. A thin environmental sheath is added on the outside.|$|R
25|$|Even more confusingly, {{a hybrid}} cable car/funicular line once {{existed in the}} form of the {{original}} Wellington Cable Car, in the New Zealand city of Wellington. This line had both a continuous loop haulage cable that the cars gripped using a cable car gripper, and a balance cable permanently attached to both cars over an undriven pulley at the top of the line. The descending car gripped the haulage cable and was pulled downhill, in turn pulling the ascending car (which remained ungripped) uphill by the balance cable. This line was rebuilt in 1979 and is now a standard funicular, although it <b>retains</b> its old <b>cable</b> car name.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSolenoid {{windings}} of Roebel cable {{are expected}} to find application in high field magnets and power equipment. We demonstrate using YBCO Roebel cable to wind a single layer solenoid and report initial mechanical and electrical characteristics. We wind the coil with a 5 / 2 cable of 7. 2 m length with insulated strands to prevent current sharing. Mechanical tests show the <b>cables</b> <b>retain</b> substantially {{the strength of the}} constituent wire even under bending with no observable change in Ic for tensile stresses below ∼ 350 MPa. We demonstrate a design of the current contacts which promote equal distribution of current in the strands. We report the critical current of the coil and the total AC loss of the coil in liquid nitrogen. These values are compared with the values for straight sections of cable...|$|R
25|$|All DT3 {{units are}} {{equipped}} with passenger intercom panels near every door {{in addition to the}} standard emergency brakes and emergency door release handles. Controllers can access CCTV cameras in every unit from the control centre through a Wireless LAN link installed in all tunnels that are used by DT3 trains. Flame-retardant materials are used wherever possible. Temperature sensors and smoke detectors are spread throughout every unit in the passenger space and in every underfloor machinery compartment to detect possible fires as early as possible. Circuit integrity <b>retaining</b> electrical <b>cables</b> (cables that can keep their insulation for a certain time in the presence of fire) are used to allow a unit to proceed to the next station in case of a fire. German regulations mandate that all subway trains must not stop inside a tunnel after the emergency brake has been pulled or if any other hazard like a fire is detected, but instead should proceed to the next station if possible to ease rescue operations. Since the longest travel time between two stations on the Nuremberg U-Bahn is about 3 Minutes (between Ziegelstein and Flughafen) and most stations are less than 60 seconds apart, this is deemed a superior option to stopping inside a tunnel, where evacuation, rescue and firefighting attempts would be much more difficult than on a station platform.|$|R
40|$|Cables is a cyclin-dependent kinase-binding nuclear {{protein that}} maps to {{chromosome}} 18 q 11 - 12. Here, we assessed Cables expression in 160 colorectal cancers (CRCs), its role in colon cancer cell growth, and the potential mechanisms of Cables inactivation. Expression levels, promoter methylation, and mutational status of Cables were investigated in colon cancer cell lines and primary colon tumors. Chromosome 18 q loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was evaluated with multiple polymorphic markers. Cables inhibited cellular proliferation and colony formation in colon cancer cell lines. Cables expression was reduced in 65 % of primary CRCs. No mutations were detected in 10 exons of Cables in 20 primary colon tumors. Cables promoter was methylated in cell lines with decreased Cables expression and vice versa. 5 -Aza- 2 ′-deoxycytidine resulted in increased Cables expression in methylated cell lines. There was a significant correlation between promoter methylation and Cables gene expression in primary colon tumors. Sixty-five percent of primary colon tumors demonstrated chromosome 18 q LOH. LOH involving the Cables region was observed in 35 % of cases, including those in which more distal portions of chromosome 18 q were <b>retained,</b> and <b>Cables</b> expression was decreased in all such cases. Loss of Cables expression in 65 % of CRCs {{suggests that it is}} a common event in colonic carcinogenesis, with promoter methylation and LOH appearing to be important mechanisms of Cables gene inactivation...|$|R
2500|$|On the funerary {{monument}} of the Egyptian king Sahure (2487–2475 BC) [...] in Abusir, {{there are}} relief images of vessels with a marked sheer (the upward curvature {{at each end}} of the hull) and seven pairs of oars along its side, a number that was likely to have been merely symbolical, and steering oars in the stern. They have one mast, all lowered and vertical posts at stem and stern, with the front decorated with an Eye of Horus, the first example of such a decoration. It was later used by other Mediterranean cultures to decorate seagoing craft in the belief that it helped to guide the ship safely to its destination. These early galleys apparently lacked a keel meaning they lacked stiffness along their length. Therefore, they had large cables connecting stem and stern resting on massive crutches on deck. They were held in tension to avoid hogging, or bending the ship's construction upwards in the middle, while at sea. In the 15th century BC, Egyptian galleys were still depicted with the distinctive extreme sheer, but had by then developed the distinctive forward-curving stern decorations with ornaments in the shape of lotus flowers. They had possibly developed a primitive type of keel, but still <b>retained</b> the large <b>cables</b> intended to prevent hogging.|$|R
40|$|A refined {{electrical}} cable model is formulated {{to investigate the}} role of a discrete gap junction in the intracellular transmission of electrical signals in an electrically coupled system of osteocytes and osteoblasts in an osteon. The model also examines the influence of the ratio q between the membrane's electrical time constant and the characteristic time of pore fluid pressure, the circular, cylindrical geometry of the osteon, and key simplifying assumptions in our earlier continuous cable model (see Zhang, D., S. C. Cowin, and S. Weinbaum. Electrical signal transmission and gap junction regulation in a bone cell network: A cable model for an osteon. Ann. Biomed. Eng. 25 : 379 - 396, 1997). Using this refined model, it is shown that (1) the intracellular potential amplitude at the osteoblastic end of the osteonal <b>cable</b> <b>retains</b> the character of a combination of a low-pass and a high-pass filter as the corner frequency varies in the physiological range; (2) the presence of a discrete gap junction near a resting osteoblast can lead to significant modulation of the intracellular potential and current in the osteoblast for measured values of the gap junction coupling strength; and (3) the circular, cylindrical geometry of the osteon is well simulated by the beam analogy used in Zhang et al...|$|R
