This technology was propelled by several factors: producing oil of commercial value <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> that meets refinery feedstock specifications, the rising global demands for energy, the declining of conventional light oil reservoirs, increasing price of light crude alongside fluctuating supply, and most importantly the abundant deposits of heavy oil and bitumen energy resources worldwide that is waiting exploitation.
