50|$|Trigonocephaly {{seems to}} be the most {{compliant}} form of craniosynostosis for surgery. Because of standardization of current surgical approaches there is no surgical mortality and complications are few to none.The simple suturectomy is presently insufficient to adjust the complicated growth restrictions caused by metopic synostosis. On the other hand, the fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling and the ‘floating forehead technique’ create sufficient space for brain growth and result in a normal horizontal axis of the orbits and supraorbital bar. The fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling is the most used method nowadays.Over the past few years distraction osteogenesis has been gradually acknowledged since it has a positive effect on hypotelorism. Expanding the distance between the orbits using springs {{seems to be}} successful. However, there are discussions whether hypotelorism <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> corrected.The minimal invasive endoscopic surgery has been gaining attention since the early 90’s, however, it has technical limitations (only strip craniectomy is possible).

An investigation by the ABC's independent Audience and Consumer Affairs Unit found that the episode breached editorial policies standards on accuracy and impartiality, later leading to the withdrawal of the episode from the ABC website. The controversy led to the temporary suspension of reporter Dr. Maryanne Demasi from the show and is the second time since Heart of the Matter, Parts 1 and 2 to have breached editorial standards.

50|$|On June 28, 2011, Nate {{appeared}} on MMA Hour with Ariel Helwani {{and stated that}} in August 2010 he felt tired and moody and his doctor discovered he had low testosterone levels. That doctor put Nate on hormone replacement therapy, and when Nate applied for a Therapeutic Use Exemption with the New Jersey state commission, they allowed it but declared that he must go off the therapy for ten weeks, then have his levels retested by a specialist to determine if he <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the therapy or not. At {{the end of that}} period, both the specialist and Nate's primary doctor agreed his levels really were low and he was a candidate for replacement therapy. Nate's primary doctor injected him with testosterone to quickly get his levels back up in time for his scheduled fight against Story. The Pennsylvania commission had set standards for what his testosterone levels could be at fight time and Nate's levels, though trending down over the last week before the fight, still failed to fall to within the range required in time for him to be cleared to fight. Nate claimed that he retook tests {{on the day of the}} fight and was actually within qualifying limits, thus having his suspension lifted by the commission.|$|E

Also in the 1990s he directed the show and created the DVD of a live Milan concert of Fausto Leali. In the last decade, he created many formats for Mediolanum Channel from “Gente di mare” to “ Piccolo fratello” but what <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> remembered in particular are the experimental activities carried out in new media - an unexpected format for Italian culture - such as “My virtual boy”, the first ideal programmable boy via Web and presented during the Future Show of the same year (the project gave rise to a movie produced by Warner Bros) and “BlackCube”, a reality format similar to Grande Fratello, in which the participants were forced into a closed environment, precisely the black cube, and they had to resolve 6 enigmas posed by a computer. Their story was filmed and transmitted both via website and satellite channels, which could be altered and enriched by public participation through special web-live interfaces. “BlackCube”, in 2001 had over 300,000 hits on line.|$|E

50|$|The {{internal}} space must {{be large enough}} for a fully kitted diver and bellman to sit, and for their umbilicals to be stowed neatly on racks, and the hatch to be opened inwards while they are inside. Anything bigger will make the bell heavier than it <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be,</b> so all equipment that {{does not need to}} be inside is mounted outside. This includes a framework to support the ancillary equipment and protect the bell from impact and snagging on obstacles,and the emergency gas supply, which is usually racked around the framework and connected via manifolds to the internal gas panel. The part of the framework that keeps the lower hatch off the bottom is called the bell stage. It may be removable. The bell umbilical is connected to the bell via through hull fittings (hull penetrations), which must withstand all operating pressures without leaking. The internal gas panel connects to the hull penetrations and the diver's umbilicals. The umbilicals will carry main breathing gas supply, a communications cable, a pneumofathometer hose, hot water supply for suit heating, power for helmet mounted lights, and possibly gas reclaim hose and video cable. The bell umbilical will usually also carry a power cable for internal and external bell lighting. Hydraulic power lines for tools do not have to pass into the interior of the bell as they will never be used there, and tools can also be stored outside. There may be an emergency through-water communications system with a battery power supply, and a location transponder working on the international standard 37.5 kHz. The bell may also have viewports and a medical lock.|$|E
5000|$|Writing for Film Journal, Edward Douglas lends a {{negative}} commentary, stating: [...] "An emotion-filled coming-of-age drama that’s more impressive for the filmmaker’s personal {{efforts to get}} the movie made than the actual film itself," [...] mentioning that the 2017 Sundance documentary made on Fitzmaurice's illness during the production of Emily is far more praiseworthy. [...] "Fitzmaurice’s brave personal story to make his first feature is peripheral, and though that fact can’t be completely forgotten once you know it, the film <b>really</b> <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> rated on its own artistic and cinematic merits." [...] He cites the film as uninteresting, likening it to a young-adult novel where it [...] "feels like it’s based on" [...] one; [...] "Emily often acts like the type of bratty teen know-it-all we often see in those adaptations." [...] He adds that often, the script feels [...] "a little too precious or even pretentious—partially because Fitzmaurice’s dialogue sometimes feels stilted, as if he’s trying too hard." [...] Receiving the performances, he says: [...] "Lynch has a pleasantly lilting voice that’s almost soothing to listen to as she talks about her memories" [...] which [...] "sadly vanishes once Emily’s road trip begins. Lynch is a decent enough actress, but not quite on par with her country-mate Saoirse Ronan, who could very well have brought more depth to the role. But she does show potential as a leading actor, and her chemistry with Webster is solid {{enough to make you}} believe their relationship ... even if the emotional range displayed by the two actors seems fairly muted." [...] Likewise, [...] "the more experienced Smiley brings more out of Lynch than her younger co-star." [...] He further compares the cinematography to Asia Argento's adaptation The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things with its [...] "washed-out and exaggerated colors." [...] Of the musical score, he cites: [...] "Fitzmaurice has a good ear for picking the right song to help set the mood, although at times you’re reminded how much better Sing Street director John Carney is at this sort of thing." [...] He concludes that despite its glaring flaws, the film offers an emotional second act.|$|E
