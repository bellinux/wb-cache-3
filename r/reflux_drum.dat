5|$|Images 4 and 5 assume an {{overhead}} stream {{that is totally}} condensed into a liquid product using water or air-cooling. However, in many cases, the tower overhead is not easily condensed totally and the <b>reflux</b> <b>drum</b> must include a vent gas outlet stream. In yet other cases, the overhead stream may also contain water vapor because either the feed stream contains some water or some steam is injected into the distillation tower (which {{is the case in}} the crude oil distillation towers in oil refineries). In those cases, if the distillate product is insoluble in water, the <b>reflux</b> <b>drum</b> may contain a condensed liquid distillate phase, a condensed water phase and a non-condensible gas phase, which makes it necessary that the <b>reflux</b> <b>drum</b> also have a water outlet stream.|$|E
50|$|The vapors {{from the}} top of the column are a mixture of {{hydrocarbon}} gases and naphtha, at a temperature of 120 °C-130 °C. The vapor stream associated with steam used at bottom of the column is condensed by the water cooler and the liquid collected in a vessel is known as <b>reflux</b> <b>drum</b> which is present at the top of the column. Some part of the liquid is returned to the top plate of the column as overhead reflux, and the remaining liquid is sent to a stabilizer column which separates gases from liquid naphtha. A few plates below the top plate, the kerosene is obtained as product at a temperature of 190 °C-200 °C. Part of this fraction is returned to the column after it is cooled by a heat exchanger. This cooled liquid is known as circulating reflux, and it is important to control the heat load in the column. The remaining crude oil is passed through a side stripper which uses steam to separate kerosene. The kerosene obtained is cooled and collected in a storage tank as raw kerosene, known as straight run kerosene that boils at a range of 140 °C-270 °C. A few plates below the kerosene draw plate, the diesel fraction is obtained at a temperature of 280 °C-300 °C. The diesel fraction is then cooled and stored. The top product from the atmospheric distillation column is a mixture of hydrocarbon gases, e.g., methane, ethane, propane, butane, and naphtha vapors. Residual oil present at the bottom of the column is known as reduced crude oil (RCO). The temperature of the stream at the bottom is 340 °C-350 °C, which is below the cracking temperature of oil.|$|E

The water stream from the bottom of this separator was mixed with the water {{from the bottom of the}} distillation <b>reflux</b> <b>drum.</b> It could be saved or be sent out of this plant.|$|E

30|$|The {{water stream}} from the boot of the Cold Separator called sour water left this system as waste. The outlet stream {{from the bottom}} of the Hot Separator {{including}} liquid hydrocarbon was combined with Cold Separator bottom stream and was fed into the Stripper for H 2 S stripping. It was assumed that pressure of Stripper was around 15 bara. Having passed through the stripper condenser, the light gas stream made up of methane, ethane, H 2, H 2 O, and H 2 S left the <b>reflux</b> <b>drum</b> of Stripper and entered the Amine plant where it was used as the fuel gas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Nigeria {{is faced}} with high import of {{petroleum}} products, incessant shortage of the product and poor petroleum refining states. There is therefore {{the need to develop}} local technology in petroleum refining as a sustainable solution to these problems (Oche 2014). This paper focus on effective designing of crude distillation unit {{which is one of the}} basis for local petroleum refining development. The CDU was designed to process 1 bbl/day of Escravos crude. The unit consist of the following components; atmospheric distillation column, crude heater, condenser, <b>reflux</b> <b>drum,</b> heat exchanger and strippers. Both manual and Aspen plus was used to carry out the design separately and the results were compared to ascertain most acceptable technique for the design of CDU. Although Aspen plus gave better design results, the design results of the manual calculation had narrow variation to Aspen plus design results. The manual design technique used was therefore effective. Therefore for CDU design, Aspen plus gives better results than manual calculation but in absence of the software a good manual technique such as that used can serve...|$|E
40|$|Butadiene 1 : 3 is {{separated}} from other C 4 -hydrocarbons by extractive distillation in a sieve plate tower. Prior to the development work to be described, the pressure in the extraction tower was controlled at a fixed value. The tower pressure-boilup control loop did not behave satisfactorily {{in the presence of}} non-condensables which entered with the feed. The capacity of the flooded <b>reflux</b> <b>drum</b> condenser for the tower was limiting production during summer months. The tower pressure control loop was put on manual. The pressure was allowed to drop to its lowest attainable value for the existing conditions of boilup and condenser cooling capability. This manner of operation is known as floating pressure control. By taking advantage of the higher relative volatility at the lower tower pressure, energy usage was reduced and there was an increase in production capacity. The tower operation at a lower temperature reduced tower and reboiler fouling. Substantial savings have resulted from these improvements. The annual energy consumption has been reduced by 25 % and maximum productive capacity is higher by 15 %. The rate of tower and reboiler fouling has not been fully quantified but is greatly reduced. A more stable tower operation has also contributed to higher productivity and reduced energy usage. Venting of non-condensables does not affect tower stability and the operators have adapted well to the new control strategy...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel steady-state identification (SSI) method {{based on the}} auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX). This method allows the SSI with reduced tuning by analyzing the identifiability properties of the system. In particular, the singularity of the model matrices is used as an index for steady-state determination. In this contribution, the novel SSI method is compared to other available techniques, namely the F-like test, wavelet transform and a polynomial-based approach. These methods are implemented for SSI of three different case studies. In the first case, a simulated dataset is used for calibrating the output-based SSI methods. The second case corresponds to a literature nonlinear continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) example running at different steady states in which the ARX-based approach is tuned with the available input-output data. Finally, an industrial case with real data of a depropanizer column from PETROBRAS S. A. considering different pieces of equipment is analyzed. The results for a <b>reflux</b> <b>drum</b> case indicate that the wavelet and the F-like test can satisfactorily detect the steady-state periods after careful tuning and when respecting their hypothesis, i. e., smooth data for the wavelet method {{and the presence of}} variance in the data for the F-like test. Through a heat exchanger case with different measurement frequencies, we demonstrate the advantages of using the ARX-based method over the other techniques, which include the aspect of online implementation...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} investigates the co-simulation of an {{extractive}} distillation column using Aspen Dynamics together with MATLAB Simulink toolbox. This extractive distillation column separates Methyl Cyclo Hexane (MCH) from Toluene by using input Phenol {{as a third}} component (entractant) to move the ternary system beyond the azeotropic point. The study started with testing the steady state model of the process in Aspen Plus; then continued with importing and testing the process dynamic model in both manual and automatic modes using Aspen Dynamics. Finally, the process model in Aspen Dynamics {{was connected to the}} built-in controllers in Simulink then the co-simulation of the controlled process was performed using Aspen Dynamics together with the MATLAB Simulink toolbox. The case study was an example taken from Aspen Dynamics version 8. 4 v. With the newest version of Aspen Dynamics and Simulink version 8. 4 operating platform Windows 7, it is required to install the 32 bit MATLAB to address compatibility issues between Aspen Dynamics and MATLAB. The same control system design including four conventional controllers was implemented by Aspen Tech in two different software package structures: in Aspen Dynamics stand-alone simulations and in Aspen Dynamics – Simulink co-simulations to control the feed tank level, reboiler level, <b>reflux</b> <b>drum</b> level and top stream pressure of column by adjusting feed 2 flowrate, coolant flowrate to condenser, bottom (Toluene and Phenol) flowrate and product (MCH) flowrate. Then a new controller was developed in Aspen Dynamics and co-simulation to control the product (MCH) purity by adjusting entrainer (Phenol) flowrate. Advanced controller (DMC) has tried to be developed in co-simulation to replace PI controller. However, attempts to develop DMC had failed after few trials. All conventional controllers were tuned using auto tuning method in Aspen Dynamics using a special tool, which is 'tuning' tool. It gives the best control parameters to achieve the best possible control response. Set point changes and disturbance changes have been made to PI controllers and variables respectively, and it is intended to investigate the effect on product purity. The new controller is very helpful in improving the level of product purity. All run shows that Aspen Dynamics stand alone, or co-simulation gives the same results in every test. Before developing Dynamics Model control (DMC) in co-simulation, DMC examples exercises from ‘ENG 420 ’ was implemented on a simple first order system in MATLAB to understand the basics of the predictive control strategy along with the effect of design parameters. All results obtained are discussed in Section Results and Discussion. Guideline for the next thesis student has been outlined {{at the end of this}} report. Overall, most of the main objectives of this thesis was achieved with very satisfying results. However due to unforeseen circumstances and time constraints, DMC controller is not fully functional...|$|E
