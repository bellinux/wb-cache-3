5000|$|A {{bonded seal}} {{consists}} of an outer annular ring of a hard material, typically steel, and an inner annular ring of an elastomeric material {{that acts as a}} gasket. It is the compression of the elastomeric part between the faces of the parts {{on either side of the}} bonded seal that provides the sealing action. The elastomeric material, typically nitrile rubber, is bonded by heat and pressure to the outer ring, which holds it in place. This structure increases <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>bursting,</b> increasing the pressure rating of the seal. Because the bonded seal itself acts to retain the gasket material, there is no need for the parts to be sealed to be shaped to retain the gasket. This results in simplified machining and greater ease of use as compared to some other seals, such as O-rings. Some designs come with an additional flap of rubber on the internal diameter to locate the bonded seal at the centre of the hole, these are called self-centring bonded washers ...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To compare experimentally, {{the healing}} of {{cervical}} oesophageal anastomoses performed either with stapler or 2 -layer hand-sewn sutures. METHODS: Thirty six dogs were randomised to two groups: stapled anastomoses (n = 18); hand-sewn anastomoses (n = 18). Each group was divided into three subgroups, corresponding to the day of sacrifice (3 rd, 7 th and 14 th postoperative day). Healing was assessed by: a) anatopathology b) anastomotic <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>bursting</b> pressure test; c) quantification of hidroxyproline RESULTS: Group 1 heal by second intention, group 2 showed a healing by first intention. Bursting pressure was similar between groups at day 3, though group 1 animals showed it significantly higher at day 7 and day 14 compared with group 2. Statiscally, there were no interaction between the day of sacrifice and groups, as well as {{there was no difference}} among the dates of observation regarding the results of hidroxyproline CONCLUSIONS: a) mechanical suture is more resistant than hand-sewn; b) In stapler anastomoses, healing was as secondary union, whereas in hand-sewn anastomoses, healing was by first intention; c) no correlation was found in the results of bursting pressure and hidroxyproline quantification...|$|E

OBJETIVO: Comparar o processo de cicatrização do esôfago cervical com sutura mecânica ou manual em dois planos. MÉTODOS: Foram utilizados 36 cães, distribuídos em dois grupos: com sutura mecânica (n = 18), e manual (n = 18). Cada grupo foi dividido em três subgrupos, que correspondiam ao dia do sacrifício (3 º p o; 7 º p o e 14 º p o). Avaliou-se: a) o estudo anatomopatológico; b) a resistência da anastomose à pressão interna; e c) a dosagem da hidroxiprolina na anastomose. No estudo anatomopatológico, o grupo 1 apresentou cicatrização por segunda intenção, o grupo 2 apresentou cicatrização em primeira intenção. RESULTADOS: Os resultados da pressão de ruptura foram semelhantes em ambos os grupos no 3 º p o; porém, o grupo 1 apresentou valores significantemente maiores no 7 º p o e no 14 º p o em relação ao grupo 2. Não houve diferença significante para os resultados de hidroxiprolina. CONCLUSÕES: a) a anastomose mecânica foi mais resistente que a manual; b) na anastomose mecânica o processo de cicatrização foi em segunda intenção, enquanto que na manual foi em primeira intenção; c) não houve correlação entre a resistência da anastomose e dosagem da hidroxiprolina tecidual...|$|E

40|$|Tissue-engineered {{vascular}} grafts require elastic, acellular porous scaffolds with controlled biodegradability and properties matching {{those of}} natural arteries. Elastin {{would be a}} desirable component for such applications, but elastin does not easily regenerate experimentally. Our approach is to develop tubular elastin scaffolds using decellularization and removal of collagen from porcine carotid arteries (∼ 5 [*]mm diameter) using alkaline extraction. Because elastin is susceptible to rapid degeneration after implantation, scaffolds were further treated with penta-galloyl glucose (PGG), an established polyphenolic elastin-stabilizing agent. Scaffolds were compared in vitro with detergent-decellularized arteries for structure, composition, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> degradation, mechanical properties, and cytotoxicity and in vivo for cell infiltration and remodeling potential. Results showed effective decellularization and almost complete collagen removal by alkaline extraction. PGG-treated elastin scaffolds proved to be resistant to elastase digestion in vitro, maintained their cylindrical shapes, showed high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>burst</b> pressures, and supported growth of endothelial cells and fibroblasts. In vivo results showed that PGG treatment reduced the rate of elastin biodegradation and controlled cell infiltration but did not hamper new collagen and proteoglycan deposition and secretion of matrix-degrading proteases. Alkali-purified, PGG-treated tubular arterial elastin scaffolds exhibit many desirable properties to be recommended for clinical applications as vascular grafts...|$|R
5000|$|Specification 5C3 of the American Petroleum Institute standardizes 14 casing sizes from 4.5 in to 20 in outside {{diameter}} ("OD"). This and related API documents also promulgate {{standards for the}} threaded end finish, the wall thickness (several are available in each size to satisfy various design parameters, and in fact are indirectly specified by standardized nominal weights per linear foot; thicker pipe obviously being heavier), and the strength and certain chemical characteristics of the steel material. Several material strengths—termed [...] "Grades" [...] and ranging from [...] to [...] minimum yield strength—are available for most combinations of OD and wall thickness to meet various design needs. Finally, the API publications provide performance minimums for longitudinal strength ("joint strength") as well as <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> internal (<b>bursting)</b> and external (collapsing) pressure differentials.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the experimental and theoretical investigation into the compression bond of column longitudinal reinforcement in the transference of axial load from a reinforced concrete column to a base. Experimental work includes twelve tests with square twisted bars and twenty four tests with ribbed bars. The effects of bar size, anchorage length in the base, plan area of the base, provision of bae tensile reinforcement, links around the column bars in the base, plan area of column and concrete compressive strength were investigated in the tests. The tests indicated that the strength of the compression anchorage of deformed reinforcing steel in the concrete was primarily dependent on the concrete strength and the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>bursting,</b> which may be available within the anchorage. It was shown in the tests without concreted columns that due to a large containment over the bars in the foundation, failure occurred due to the breakdown of bond followed by the slip of the column bars along the anchorage length. The experimental work showed that the bar size, the stress in the bar, the anchorage length, provision of the transverse steel and the concrete compressive strength significantly affect the bond stress at failure. The ultimate bond stress decreases as the anchorage length is increased, while the ultimate bond stress increases with increasing each of the remainder parameters. Tests with concreted columns also indicated that a section of the column contributed to the bond length in the foundation by acting as an extra anchorage length. The theoretical work is based on the Mindlin equation(3), an analytical method used in conjunction with finite difference calculus. The theory is used to plot the distribution of bond stress in the elastic and the elastic-plastic stage of behaviour. The theory is also used to plot the load-vertical displacement relationship of the column bars in the anchorage length, and also to determine the theoretical failure load of foundation. The theoretical solutions are in good agreement with the experimental results and the distribution of bond stress is shown to be significantly influenced by the bar stiffness factor K. A comparison of the experimental results with the current codes shows that the bond stresses currently used are low and in particular, CPIlO(56) specifies very conservative design bond stresses...|$|E
30|$|Since {{across all}} formulations, the {{elasticity}} of human skin rated at 18.8 MPa (Silver et al. 2007) was not surpassed, elastic modulus {{was not a}} criterion for choosing the film formulation for studying {{the release of the}} model drug 5 -FU. Chitosan, specifically the CD 0.5 formulation, was chosen over alginate as the main polymer to encapsulate 5 -FU because of its significantly higher sorption ability and superior <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> membrane <b>burst.</b> Comparative drug elution profiles for the control CD 0.5 film encapsulating microspheres and 5 -FU are presented in Figure 5 c. Drug release was characterized by the absence of a lag phase (t B [*]=[*] 0) and immediate diffusion. The percentage of 5 -FU released from the CD 0.5 film is 57 % as compared to 41 % for the CD 0.5 film encapsulating the microspheres.|$|R
40|$|Extracellular {{pathogenic}} Escherichia coli (ExPEC) strains {{are common}} causes {{of a variety}} of clinical syndromes, including urinary tract infections, abdominal infections, nosocomial pneumonia, neonatal meningitis, and sepsis. ExPEC strains are extracellular bacterial pathogens; therefore, the innate immune response (e. g., professional phagocytes) plays {{a crucial role in the}} host defense against them. Studies using the model ExPEC strain CP 9 demonstrated that it is relatively resistant to neutrophil-mediated bactericidal activity. Although this could be due <b>to</b> <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> phagocytosis, the ability of CP 9 to survive the intracellular killing mechanisms of neutrophils is another possibility. Using a variation of the intracellular invasion assay, we studied the survival of CP 9 within peripheral blood-derived human neutrophils. Our results indicated that CP 9 did survive within human neutrophils, but we were unable to demonstrate that intracellular replication occurred. This finding was not unique to CP 9, since when a conservative assessment of survival was used, four of six additional ExPEC strains, but not an E. coli laboratory strain, were also capable of survival within neutrophils. Initial studies in which we began to decipher the mechanisms by which CP 9 is able to successfully survive intracellular neutrophil-mediated bactericidal activity demonstrated that CP 9 was at least partially susceptible to the neutrophil oxidative <b>burst.</b> Therefore, absolute <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the oxidative <b>burst</b> is not a mechanism by which ExPEC survives within neutrophils. In addition, electron microscopy studies showed that CP 9 appeared to be present in phagosomes within neutrophils. Therefore, avoidance of phagosomal uptake or subsequent escape from the phagosome does not appear to be a mechanism that contributes to CP 9 's survival. These findings suggest that survival of ExPEC within neutrophils may be an important virulence mechanism...|$|R
