Gwil Sainsbury amicably departed the band in early 2014. Their second album, This Is All Yours, was released on 22 September 2014 and went straight to UK number one. As a replacement for Sainsbury, Cameron Knight became a supporting member for alt-J's live shows, playing guitar, bass and sampler. In 2017, the band released their third studio album, <b>Relaxer,</b> and are currently playing as a trio.|$|E
25|$|Flair's son David is a semi-retired {{professional}} wrestler. Flair's {{younger son}} Reid, {{who signed a}} developmental contract with WWE {{near the end of}} 2007, was an accomplished high school wrestler and made several appearances on WCW television along with his sister Ashley and half-sister Megan. In 2004, Flair became a grandfather at the age of 55, when his older daughter, Megan Fliehr Ketzner, gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Morgan Lee Ketzner on May 9. On May 17, 2012, it was reported that Flair's daughter Ashley had signed with WWE adopting the ring name, Charlotte (which was later changed to include the Flair surname). On March 29, 2013, Reid died from an accidental overdose of heroin, Xanax and a muscle <b>relaxer.</b>|$|E
25|$|HxA3 is {{extremely}} unstable and HxB3 is moderately unstable, rapidly decomposing to their tri-hydroxy products, for example, during isolation procedures that use an even mildly acidic methods; {{they are also}} rapidly metabolized enzymatically in cells to these same tri-hydroxy products, termed trioxilins (TrX's) or trihydroxyeicoxatrienoic acids (THETA's); HxA3 is converted to 8,11,12-trihydroxy-5Z,9E,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid (trioxilin A3 or TrXA3) while TxB3 is converted to 10,11,12-trihydroxy-5Z,8Z,14Z-eicosatrienoic acid (trioxilin B3 or TrXB3). A third trihydroxy acid, 8,9,12-trihydroxy-5Z,10E,14Z eicosatrienoic acid (trioxilin C3 or TrXC3), has been detected in rabbit and mouse aorta tissue incubated with arachidonic acid. The metabolism of HxA3 to TrXA3 and HXB3 to TrX is accomplished by soluble epoxide hydrolase in mouse liver; since it is widely distributed in various tissues of various mammalian species, including humans, soluble epoxide hydrolase may be the principal enzyme responsible for metabolizing these and perhaps other hepoxilin compounds. It seems possible, however, that other similarly acting epoxide hydrolases such as microsomal epoxide hydrolase or epoxide hydrolase 2 may prove to hepoxilin hydrolase activity. While the trihydroxy products of hepoxilin synthesis are {{generally considered to be}} inactive and the sEH pathway therefore considered as functioning to limiting the actions of the hepoxilins, some studies found that TrXA3, TrXB3, and TrXC3 were more powerful than HxA3 in relaxing pre-contracted mouse arteries and that TrXC3 was a relatively potent <b>relaxer</b> of rabbit pre-contracted aorta.|$|E
