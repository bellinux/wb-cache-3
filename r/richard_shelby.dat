Since 1988 the term boll weevils has fallen out of favor.|$|E

25|$|Many {{conservative}} Southern Democrats {{defected to}} the Republican Party, {{beginning with the}} passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the general leftward shift of the party. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, Kent Hance and Ralph Hall of Texas, and <b>Richard</b> <b>Shelby</b> of Alabama are examples of this. The influx of conservative Democrats into the Republican Party is often cited as a reason for the GOP's shift further to the right during the late 20th century, as well as the shift of its base from the Northeast and Midwest to the South.|$|E

25|$|During the 1996 United States Presidential {{election}} Warner {{served as}} a Senate teller (along with Democrat Wendell H. Ford) of electoral votes.

Warner and others who voted against the article angered many Republicans by their position. However, unlike Snowe, Collins, Specter, Jeffords and Chafee, the rest of the Republicans voted guilty on the second article.|$|E
500|$|The boycott was {{supported}} by some of Alabama's Congressional delegation, including both senators and Representative Spencer Bachus (R-AL), who represents Mountain Brook.

Shelby stated, [...] "For the safety, security and well-being of our citizens, I do not believe that we can trust that we will be protected while in Aruba." [...] Prime Minister Oduber stated that Aruban investigators have done their best to solve the case, and responded to the call for boycott, [...] "This is a preposterous and irresponsible act.

500|$|On July 17, 2011, Cordray was {{selected}} over Warren {{as the head}} of the entire CFPB. However, his nomination was immediately in jeopardy because 44 Senate Republicans had previously vowed to derail any nominee in order to push for a decentralized structure to the organization. [...] This was part of a pattern of conflict between Republicans in the Senate and the Obama administration that had led to record numbers of blocked and failed nominations. On July 21, 2011, Senator <b>Richard</b> <b>Shelby</b> wrote an op-ed article for The Wall Street Journal affirming continued opposition (that went back to a May 5 letter to the President) to a centralized structure, noting that both the Securities Exchange Commission and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had executive boards and that the CFPB should be no different. Politico interpreted Shelby's statements as saying that Cordray's nomination was [...] "Dead on Arrival". In October, as the nomination continued to be on hold, the National Association of Attorneys General endorsed Cordray. On December 8, 2011, the Senate failed to secure cloture on Cordray's nomination. The final vote was 53-45, with 50 out of 51 Democrats voting for cloture, and 45 out of 47 Republicans voting against.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{progressive}} {{critics argue}} the DLC's centrism {{has led the}} Democratic party to multiple electoral defeats, DLC candidates, office holders, and their moderate policies have been generally favored by the American electorate.
