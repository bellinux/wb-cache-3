2500|$|The {{additional}} {{mass of the}} soil substrate and <b>retained</b> <b>water</b> places a large strain on the structural support of a building. [...] This makes it unlikely for intensive green roofs to become widely implemented {{due to a lack}} of buildings that are able to support such a large amount of added weight as well as the added cost of reinforcing buildings to be able to support such weight. [...] Some types of green roofs do have more demanding structural standards especially in seismic regions of the world. [...] Some existing buildings cannot be retrofitted with certain kinds of green roof because of the weight load of the substrate and vegetation exceeds permitted static loading. The weight of a green roof caused the collapse of a large sports hall roof in Hong Kong in 2016. In the wake of the disaster numerous other green roofs around the territory were removed.|$|E

Some of this water will steadily drain through the soil (via gravity) and end up in the waterways and streams, but much of it will be retained, despite the influence of gravity.

50|$|In 2005 about 25% of the world's 33,105 large dams (over 15  metres in height) {{were used}} for hydroelectricity. However of 80,000 dams of all sizes in the U.S., only 3% produce electricity. A {{reservoir}} generating hydroelectricity includes turbines connected to the <b>retained</b> <b>water</b> body by large-diameter pipes. These generating sets {{may be at the}} base of the dam or some distance away. In a flat river valley a reservoir needs to be deep enough to create a head of water at the turbines; and if there are periods of drought the reservoir needs to hold enough water to average out the river's flow throughout the year(s). Run-of-the-river hydro in a steep valley with constant flow needs no reservoir.|$|E
