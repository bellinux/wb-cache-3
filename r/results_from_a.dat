5|$|At {{present the}} golden white-eye is very common, {{and in fact}} a 1996 study found that their densities on Saipan were among the highest {{recorded}} for any bird, up to 2,095 birds/km² (8.47 per acre). It was believed that Saipan cannot sustain a larger population of this white-eye than it already does. A 2009 study, which incorporated <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 2007 survey, found that the species had declined between 1982 and 2007, in common with two other species on Saipan, the rufous fantail and the nightingale reed warbler. All three species are insectivorous and were theorised to have declined due to habitat loss. Nevertheless, the species remained relatively abundant, and the current world population is estimated at around 71,997 birds.|$|E
5|$|DKA happens {{most often}} in those with type 1 {{diabetes}}, but can also occur in those {{with other types of}} diabetes under certain circumstances. Triggers may include infection, not taking insulin correctly, stroke, and certain medications such as steroids. DKA <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> shortage of insulin; in response the body switches to burning fatty acids which produces acidic ketone bodies. DKA is typically diagnosed when testing finds high blood sugar, low blood pH, and ketoacids in either the blood or urine.|$|E

5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E

5|$|Prosody is {{the study}} of the meter, rhythm, and {{intonation}} of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to the scanning of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E

5|$|<b>Results</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling {{has occurred in the}} internal matrix of the rib. The medullary cavity, which houses the marrow, is marked by the presence of many cavities, or lacunae. On the outer surface of the bone, osteons have almost completely replaced the interior of the bone; the layered growth of the bone is more visible on the interior of the bone, where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the medullary region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable.|$|E

The physics of snow crystal development in clouds <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations, thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} {{blamed the}} failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer. Relations between NASA and the optics {{company had been}} severely strained during the telescope construction, due to frequent schedule slippage and cost overruns. NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on test <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> single instrument.|$|E

5|$|Waterborne {{manganese}} has {{a greater}} bioavailability than dietary manganese. According to <b>results</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> 2010 study, higher levels of exposure to manganese in drinking water are associated with increased intellectual impairment and reduced intelligence quotients in school-age children. It is hypothesized that long-term exposure to the naturally occurring manganese in shower water puts up to 8.7 million Americans at risk. However, data indicates that the human body can recover from certain adverse effects of overexposure to manganese if the exposure is stopped and the body can clear the excess.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. <b>Results</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E
