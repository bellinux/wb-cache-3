The major products and services offered through the retail banking segment included individual and small business deposit accounts, mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, auto loans, business equipment financing, financial planning and investment services, online bill payment and Visa check and credit cards. [...] NetBank, through its Internet banking operations, operated as an FDIC-insured, federally chartered thrift institution serving approximately 286 thousand customers throughout the United States and in more than 90 foreign countries. NetBank delivered its products and services through <b>remote</b> <b>delivery</b> channels, such as the Internet, telephone and ATMs, that are available 24 {{hours a day and}} seven days a week. It did not maintain a branch network to support its banking business. The branchless model provided an opportunity to operate with less overhead expense than traditional branch banks. Customers initially relied on direct deposit and first class mail to make deposits into their accounts, supplemented later by QuickPost (free deposit drop-off at UPS Stores for overnight delivery to NetBank) and ATM deposits.|$|E

The delivery model for MPEG- 4 also called as DMIF (as recently standardized by ISO/IEC) is used as plug-ins for wide variety of distributed real-time applications right from video conferencing to interactive virtual games. Our design {{is in the form}} of a communication middleware that offers manifold advantages including increased efficiency, dynamic transport channels with QoS support and dedicated functionality towards underlying network stacks. MPEG- 4 DMIF delivery middleware (termed here as DMIFWare) integrates three key delivery technologies namely broadcast (e. g. HDTV), disk delivery (e. g. DVD, CD) and <b>remote</b> network <b>delivery.</b> In this paper we describe the design and implementation of a middleware for <b>remote</b> network <b>delivery.</b> Several issues have been taken into consideration so as to include design features like flexibility, modularity, QoS support, programmable and interoperable transport stack along with issues that are pertinent to an efficient DMIFWare design. Design features of DMIFWare were also compared with other existing middleware design. The features incorporated within DMIFWare were found to be quite satisfactory, even tough we believe that a seamless integration of other delivery technologies (disk delivery, broadcast delivery) into our existing design will enhance the DMIFWare outlook...|$|R

40|$|Acquired {{brain injury}} (ABI), often arising from stroke or trauma, {{is a common}} cause of {{long-term}} disability, physical inactivity and poor health outcomes globally. Individuals with ABI face many barriers to increasing physical activity, such as impaired mobility, access to services and knowledge regarding management of physical activity. Self-management programmes aim to build skills to enable an individual to manage their condition, including their physical activity levels, {{over a long period}} of time. Programme delivery modes can include traditional face-to-face methods, or <b>remote</b> <b>delivery,</b> such as via the Internet. However, it is unknown how effective these programmes are at specifically improving physical activity in community-dwelling adults with ABI, or how effective and acceptable <b>remote</b> <b>delivery</b> of self-management programmes is for this population. We will conduct a comprehensive search for articles indexed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO, AMED, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PEDro and Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED) databases that assess the efficacy of a self-management intervention, which aims to enhance levels of physical activity in adults living in the community with ABI. Two independent reviewers will screen studies for eligibility, assess risk of bias, and extract relevant data. Where possible, a meta-analysis will be performed to calculate the overall effect size of self-management interventions on physical activity levels and on outcomes associated with physical activity. A comparison will also be made between face-to-face and <b>remote</b> <b>delivery</b> modes of self-management programmes, in order to examine efficacy and acceptability. A content analysis of self-management programmes will also be conducted to compare aspects of the intervention that are associated with more favourable outcomes. This systematic review aims to review the efficacy of self-management programmes aimed at increasing physical activity levels in adults living in the community with ABI, and the efficacy and acceptability of <b>remote</b> <b>delivery</b> of these programmes.
