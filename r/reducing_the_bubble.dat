40|$|Gas-solids {{fluidized}} {{beds are}} characterized {{by the presence of}} gas voids or bubbles causing a mass-transfer resistance. Enhancing the mass transfer from the bubbles to the emulsion phase by <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>bubble</b> size can be advantageous for the chem. performance (like the conversion and selectivity) of the reactor. A model using a 2 -D version of the dynamic bubble model of R. Clift and J. R. Grace (1970, 1971) where bubble trajectories are predicted based on an analytic expression for the flow field around a bubble was studied. Bubble coalescence can be reduced by injecting bubbles in certain patterns, which leads to a redn. of the av. bubble size higher in the bed. A simple proportional feedback control method to force bubbles on a horizontal line made it possible to generate a bubble injection pattern automatically, leading to smaller bubbles than without the feedback control method. The principle of the controlled bubble injection could lead to improved gas distributor designs. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E

Lundin et al. reduced CO 2 formation at the DMFC anode by chemically enhanced its solubility [17]. The non-equipotent serpentine flow field was proposed by Li et al., and results showed that the new flow fields could reduce inlet-to-outlet pressure drops and improve the cell performance significantly [18]. Hutzenlaub et al. studied the effects of wettability on both channel walls and diffusion layers in μDMFC anode. They concluded that the hydrophilic flow channel can lead to a minimum pressure drop along the channel, and the bubbles will show virtually no pinning inside the channel [19]. However, although these methods have proven effective for <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>bubble</b> clogging in DMFC flow fields, the two-phase hybrid delivery in a same channel will still inevitably lead to mutual restraint and interference of different components. Hence, there is an urgent need for new flow field designs that can render effective separation of the fuel and gas bubbles.|$|E

Microbubble dosing with 5 % CO 2 gas showed improved K L a by 30 % -  100 % across different flow rates, compared to fine-bubble dosing.

The results of thermal conductivity and morphology indicated that presence of SM-MMT improved thermal insulating properties due to reduction of average cell size. Thermal, mechanical and barrier properties were significantly enhanced for the nanocomposites filled with low content of SM-MMT compared to pure cellulose foam.

We concentrate on foaming processes of Al alloy melts following the gas injection route and review briefly the theory about bubble formation in a liquid by gas injection.

X ray observation of the process allows us to evaluate in situ the changes in bubble size during foam formation in the molten state. Through metallographic cross sections we can corroborate the bubble size distribution once cooled down and solidified. Alignment of bubbles could be observed and, therefore, even ordering could be possible in future as it is the case in aqueous foams.

Since the motion of "bubbles" is an important influence on fluidized bed heat transfer, {{a better understanding of}} their behavior is necessary for improving the design of fluidized bed boilers. Using a two-dimensional bed, silica sand particles were fluidized with air at room conditions. The bubbling bed was videotaped, and both qualitative and quantitative information were gathered. Bubble characteristics such as size, rise velocity and frequency were studied while particle size and superficial gas velocity were varied. Results were compared with some existing theories and other similar research. The effect of internal surfaces at several heights in the bed was also studied. General bubble behavior agreed well with descriptions from previous research, and the expected spherical-cap bubble shape was observed. Both bubble size and rise velocity increased with particle size and with fluid velocity. Bubble frequency increased with fluid velocity, but decreased with increasing particle size and height in the bed. These results agree with previous work done using optical probes to measure bubble characteristics. Comparisons of data with empirical models showed general agreement.

The role of the air bubbles to destabilize the emulsion and form a clear oil layer was observed on previous research, but not investigated further until the current research. Initial hypotheses stated that the air bubbles were assisting the mechanism by rupturing the protein film and inducing coalescence by direct contact between droplet/droplet or droplet/oil layer, and by surface aided contact, using the bubble as a mediator for coalescence. A sensitivity analysis of the 4 phase mixture (O/W/Y/A) system to yield a clear oil layer by changing operational parameters {{was used to determine}} and explain the existing interaction of the air bubbles with the oil droplets to induce their coalescence according to the results obtained and phenomena observed. Preliminary experiments were performed to identify the factors influencing the aeration process and understand the requirements to compare the parameters individually. The dynamics of the separation process were studied using a setup consisting of 4 custom made glass columns, custom made steel plate spargers and air flow mass controllers. The value to compare the different series of experiments was the percentage of oil recovered in each column. The results revealed an influence in the four parameters changed, superficial gas velocity, height, bubble size and yeast concentration. The increase of the superficial gas velocity resulted in a higher percentage recovery but without the presence of a clear oil layer (large droplets accumulated at the top instead). The increase of height in the mixture aerated resulted in a lower percentage recovery and large droplets accumulated at the top. In contrast, the reduction of the height resulted in a very positive recovery and the {{formation of a}} clear oil layer, almost immediately. The increase of the air superficial area by <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>bubble</b> size produced a higher recovery but with a large variation for the results obtained with the smallest bubble size.

40|$|Reducing drag in {{fluid flow}} {{has been one}} of the most widely studied topics in fluid {{dynamics}} due to the significant impact on improving operational efficiencies and cutting cost in applications from the aerospace, automotive and naval industries. Over the past two decades, superhydrophobic surfaces have been in the spotlight due to their ability to reduce frictional drag on the wall surface in both laminar and turbulent flows. Despite the extensive work on superhydrophobic surfaces, there are still a number of open questions remaining. In this dissertation, we investigate how a moving contact line interacts with a superhydrophobic surface by performing the first dynamic contact angle measurements to better understand the dynamics of droplets and streams on the surfaces. Our measurements found that the dynamic advancing contact angles on a superhydrophobic surface remains constant independent on capillary number while the dynamic receding contact angles decreases with capillary number but at a rate much slower than on a smooth surface. Furthermore, we investigated the role of the air-water interface shapes on the drag reduction. A novel microfluidic device was designed to incorporate superhydrophobic pillars. The shape of the air-water interface was changed with change to the static pressure in the channel. Slip along interface trapped within the superhydrophobic surface was found to result in significant drag reduction. However, the changes in flow geometry due to changes in bubble shape dominated effects due to slip. <b>Reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>bubble</b> size amplified drag reduction, while increasing bubble size reduced drag reduction and even resulted in drag enhancement. In this dissertation, we also studies liquid-infused superhydrophobic surfaces as an alternative to the air-infused superhydrophobic surfaces. In the studies presented here, various immiscible oils were infused into the structures of precisely patterned and randomly rough superhydrophobic surfaces. A series of experiments were performed to investigate how liquid-infused surface affect drag reduction and droplet impact dynamics. The pressure drop reduction and slip length on the liquid-infused surfaces in microchannels were found to increase as the ratio between viscosity of water and the infused oil was increased. The longevity of these surfaces was also studied with the most effective surface found to be randomly rough. The effect of the viscosity ratio was also investigated on the droplet impact dynamics onto liquid-infused superhydrophobic surfaces. The increase in the viscosity ratio was found to increase a maximum diameter and a spreading/retraction rates of droplets. Taken together, the experimental research presented in this dissertation have allowed us to better understand and optimize the design of air-infused and liquid-infused superhydrophobic surfaces for drag reduction, droplet spreading and liquid mobility.

50|$|The {{absence of}} oil (or the {{significantly}} lower oil content compared to traditionally brewed coffee) makes the system more stable and <b>the</b> <b>bubbles</b> do not collapse {{with the same}} ease as in crema. Soon after the foam is created, a process of thickening takes place where water molecules are constantly pushed out of the frothy mixture. The water is pushed out due to drainage occurring due to pressure differentials along the foam septum. Higher viscosity will retard the phenomenon, {{and that is the}} reason that the addition of sugar will create a better foam. The phenomenon continues until bubbles come very close together and the foam almost solidifies. This process can take between 2 minutes to 10 minutes and depends strongly on the agitation process during mixing.
